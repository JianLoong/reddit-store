My (27f) bf (26m) of 5 months has a chronic habit of being late. And by late I don\u2019t mean a few mins, I mean like at minimum an hour. Most of the time it doesn\u2019t really bother me because I\u2019m a homebody so it\u2019s not a big deal, but in cases where there\u2019s an event happening or we have somewhere to go, it\u2019s been very frustrating for me and I feel like I\u2019m becoming a nag about it. There has been 5 previous events/plans he has been late or bailed on completely, not including all the times he\u2019s just been late to hang out at my place. \n\nContext. I live alone, and he lives with his parents. I work a full time job that is moderately stressful, managing a disability. He is in university taking his bachelors part time, but he is off for the summer and has chosen not to work. \n\nLast night, my best friends were coming over for a watch party / pizza night type thing. My bf was going to come and sleepover after. The only thing he had to do that day was take his summer tires in to change over from his winters. I\u2019d told my bf what time they were coming (7) and that I was having a bit of a hard day with my disability, and he said that he wanted to arrive at least an hour before my friends arrived to spend time with me and relax for a bit after I was done work. I planned to walk my dog with him, maybe catch up, figure out dinner stuff etc. He said he was going to arrive between 5:30 and 6. At 5:20, I get a text that he\u2019s gonna take a shower and then be on his way. I text him around 5:50 asking what\u2019s up and nothing. At 6:20, he tells me he just got out of the shower. He finally arrives at 6:55, just before my friends. I told him I was upset about him being so late, and he made a joke about having to jerk off in the shower and that\u2019s why it took an hour. He was grumpy and quiet most of the evening which was awkward. When the evening ended, I\u2019d told him I didn\u2019t feel up to having a sleepover (he sleeps over about 4-5 times per week) and that I wanted my bed to myself. He got upset at me that I continue to bring up his lateness and said it was not his fault and he\u2019s not trying to be late but he just gets \u201clost in the sauce\u201d and left grumpy. I told him that I\u2019d repeatedly said how people being on time and showing up when they say they will is the easiest way to make me feel loved and cared about. He said he can\u2019t help it. However, I feel bad that I kicked him out.

Ask once, nicely, and explain the reason (when you are late it makes me feel like I'm not important, would you mind putting in effort not to be late, I'm happy to help if there is anything I can do). If they agree to change, it's okay to remind them once (i.e. \"You promised you wouldn't be late anymore. You were late today and it feels like you didn't even try. I don't want to nag, but you said you would try and this is really important to me, so can you please try to be on time?\")\n\nIf, at anytime they say something like \"this is who I am,\" or they fail to change after being reminded, stop. That's your sign they don't want to and aren't going to change. At that point, you either decided to end the relationship, or you accept who they are. You don't get to keep dating them and keep complaining about a character flaw they have shown that they are unwilling to change.", "NTA - it\u2019s obvious your boyfriend has no regard or respect for your time, seeing how he\u2019s so happy to waste it and then joke about it. He can help it, he\u2019s hoping you change your boundaries before he changes his bad habits. \n\nFlat out tell him that until he learns to appreciate you and your time, he\u2019s gotta operate on your schedule. If that\u2019s too hard for him, there\u2019s another girl out there willing to put up with it. \n\nGood for you holding to your boundaries.

Whose fault is it, or for what reason does he say causes it? Has he been evaluated for ADHD or something else that might be at the root of a lack of focus and executive functioning?", "NTA. He ***can*** help himself. I have known multiple chronically late individuals who I had to end relationships with because they never changed.

That unimportant thing suddenly has a voice, the horror. /'s.\nWhy are you putting up with his disrespect? You deserve better.", "NTA. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt until you got to the part where he said it wasn't his fault, and he thought masturbating in the shower was a legitimate reason.

You don't have to accept being at the literal bottom of his list.", "NTA.  He has no job and is on summer break.  There is zero reason for him to be late all the time, it's a lack of respect or thought.  Rather than deflecting all of the blame and making nasty jokes, does he ever apologize and actually take responsibility for his lateness?  Do you see him actually making any efforts at all to fix this pattern of behavior?\n\nLook, you've only been together for 5 months.

I still usually tell him appointment times that have a buffer built in just in case--and my expectations (and how I plan things) have lowered/changed significantly.  Fortunately, he is capable of being on time if I tell him something is super important and his specific line of work is pretty flexible on start times.

Maybe he's got untreated ADHD or something, but that is his issue to actively address to mitigate its impact on his life and your relationship. If he doesn't have ADHD he needs to grow up and become respectful of others' time and learn to plan ahead and maintain his time commitments (obviously with room for unexpected things to come up on occasion which can make someone late. jerking off in the shower is not that.

After a couple years being frustrated with her, we started telling her an earlier time to arrive at things than we told others. Took her 20 years to catch on.", "NTA. I HATE late people. They are rude, dismissive of other people's time, and overall disrespectful.  He needs to learn that the world doesn't revolve around him and if he screws up AND DOESN'T apologize, he suffers the consequences.", "NTA, sounds like your dating an immature lowlife", "I wanted you to dump him just for changing out his winter tires at the end of July. At this point why even bother. Good god.", "I used to be very late like this and my boyfriend who is now my husband very kindly but firmly told me that he felt disrespected by my tardiness and that he didn't appreciate being made to wait. I had never thought about it as disrespect or as a power play and when I realized how it impacted him and how I had impacted others of my life before, I changed and it took a lot of effort.  But now I am very much on time to most of events. I'm not saying that he doesn't have other shortcomings but if this really bothers you then I would talk to him about it and if he addresses it consciously great, if he does not then you know he doesn't respect you or your time. Or if he's just not really a responsible person overall, don't waste the time and move on from this relationship", "NTA.  Don\u2019t date a 26 year old who lives with his parents and doesn\u2019t have a full time job.  Big red flags right there.  Always being late is another big red flag.", "Bruh hes changing his winter to summer rn? its JULY.... he has more problems than lateness to hang out he needs to get his life together and you need someone more on your level. nta", "ADHD sounds like a possibility. Getting lost inside tasks .. (still not an excuse  \u2014 just thinking he might not know, so possibly he's defensive about some struggles). \n\nNTA either way as U decide who and when someone sleeps in your bed. Good on you for expecting respectful treatment. Always ask for that and give it", "Time to let him go!", "Being late all the time is extremely disrespectful\u2026", "NTA\n\nYou will be an AH to yourself if you stay with someone who doesn't respect you or your time.", "I dated a guy like that and it turned out he had a bunch of side pieces. I didn't mind the lateness all that much but I just want to share that, in hindsight, someone who doesn't respect time can have a lot of valid excuses for other things that you won't be happy about.", "NTA. This seems like a deal-breaker for you. So break the deal. DTMFA.", "NTA. Be done. Chronic lateness like this is just selfishness, and shows lack of consideration for others. He will never change, and will likely get worse over time. You're better off without him.", "Maybe he has ADD or ADHD that hasn't been diagnosed yet. Or he is the most inconsiderate and disrespectful ass around. When someone is constantly late to everything,  that person has no respect for anyone else. \n\nDump him or get him diagnosed. Either way he the ass. Not you. NTA", "I disagree with the \u201cset an alarm and it will be fixed\u201d part of it. If he has ADHD, you can\u2019t just will yourself to fix things. The alarm rings and you get distracted by other things. You go to take a 15 minute shower and throw some clothes on an an hour later, you\u2019re standing in front of the mirror wondering where the time went. Medicine might help, therapy to help develop skills/techniques to minimize his executive dysfunction is also an option.\n\nYou are right in that he doesn\u2019t care enough or doesn\u2019t see it as a big enough problem to make an effort or seek help if he is truly struggling and not just lazy and rude.\n\nEither way, OP is under no obligation to tolerate his behavior. If he were making a visible effort of some kind, she would least have better reason to consider staying with him.\n\nMTA", "Guy here, if he was into you and cared he would be on time (sure I get it once in a blue moon stuff happens) he clearly is not willing to put the effort in\u2026. Move on and find someone who will make you a priority", "he might have ADHD - ask if he\u2019s been tested", "He has shown you who he is and how he prioritizes you.  Time for you to move on.", "You are NTA. Your so called boyfriend has no respect for anyone's (especially yours) time. Being 5-10 or a little longer late is alright from time to time, but when he knows that people are coming over at a certain time and is still late, he does not care about your time at all. There's no excuse to be late like that anymore with access to smartphones. If he is on time for other things, but not when it comes to you or his responsibilities, leave him. He doesn't really care about you. Save yourself a lot of time and just end the relationship.", "NTA.  He doesn't respect you.  Cut your losses.", "My girlfriend and I aren't always great at time keeping.  If we say \"meet at 11\", I'll sometimes get stuck in traffic and however early I leave or hard I try, suddenly  it's 11.15. Similarly she will wait until the last minute to leave sometimes and then find unexpected roadworks. Nothing malicious just not allowing enough time.But if its something important or there is a set time then we are both usually early.Because we respect each other and would never want to upset the other. \n\nOP's boyfriend doesn't seem to be trying at all. He just turns up when he wants to. He made no effort despite promising to and knowing that OP needed him.\n\nYou are certainly NTA OP. He needs to start respecting you and at the minimum at least try to get there on time. If he can't do that, then you are probably wasting your time OP.", "Is he an hour late to all of his classes? If not then he CAN help it. \n\nNTA", "NTA- Fully understandable action... MY only concern is you date someone who uses \"lost in the sauce\"", "NTA.  Its not a huge deal but still disrespectful.  If you do nothing he will assume that it just doesn't matter.  It doesn't merit a huge overreaction, but not sleeping over one night, out of 4-5 per week, isn't an overreaction.  It just shows that it really does matter to you and makes you feel unappreciated and unattracted to him when it keeps happening.", "You are the asshole", "People are either on time or they\u2019re not. It\u2019s not as simple as just showing up when you say you\u2019re going to. Trust me I know. I\u2019m on time relatively the vast majority of the time. My sisters? Fucking forget it. It\u2019s just how people are wired. Their internal clocks aren\u2019t the same as people who are on time. If that bothers you, then end it. If it\u2019s not a relationship ended for you, then learn to deal with it and move on.", "You\u2019re also supposed to get what you want. Next time you do stuff with friends, don\u2019t invite him. If he asks to see you when you have plans, tell him that you have plans. When he asks why he\u2019s not included, tell him that you got the message that he\u2019s not interested in hanging w/ friends, so you don\u2019t want to wait around.", "NTA\n\nI have ADHD and I have been the partner who has been late to things and hurt my boyfriend\u2019s feelings. \n\nI would show up to his place ages after we agreed I would get there and he would be upset. I would be upset too, but because I knew I\u2019d hurt his feelings. And that\u2019s a terrible feeling, knowing that you\u2019re the reason why someone you care deeply about is hurt and upset. \n\nSo, I would set alarms, I would prep the night before, I would stay in regular contact with him throughout the day, letting him know what I was doing to keep myself accountable and try and mitigate any distractions and delays. Because I never want to be the reason why the person I love is feeling hurt. \n\nI\u2019m still not perfect. I\u2019m having major tardiness issues at work currently because nobody cares what time I get in, so I am 10-20 minutes late every day because there\u2019s no consequences. But there were consequences in my relationship and that\u2019s what forced the change in my ADHD brain. \n\nIf this guy respected you, like I respect my boyfriend, he would be apologising for hurting your feelings and making changes to prevent it from happening again. I don\u2019t know much else about your relationship so I am not going to tell you to end it or anything, but just take this into consideration and consider what\u2019s best for you \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77", "He's a child. Being on time is one of the easiest things to do as an adult. NTA", "NTA\u2026.you teach people how to treat you. If you don\u2019t stand up for yourself you can expect more of this lateness and more. To me, habitual lateness says \u201cmy time is more than yours \u201c\u2026so inconsiderate. His behavior when you did stand up for yourself tells you everything you need to know!", "Being timely can be helped. He makes it to class on time, doesn't he?\n\nIt is entirely disrespectful to be so late. Back in my twenties when I was dating, if someone was more than 15-20 minutes late, I left the house.

Does he own a phone?  It has this magical thing on it called An Alarm.  If he needs a reminder of time when in shower or anywhere else he Could choose to set one.  He Chooses not to and Chooses to disrespect your time with these actions.  I'm curious what do you think happens if he is your plus one to a wedding, how about your parents birthday party, oh here's a fun one How is he going to FUNCTION in the working world?  Last I checked being regularly an hour or more late Will get you fired from almost anywhere.  Might want to think long and hard about whether someone who makes excuses for something that is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WITHIN THEIR POWER TO FIX is going to function as a long term partner.", "No. Just no. Not okay and will never get better.", "INFO: Isn\u2019t July a little late in the year to be switching over from winter tires?", "people saying its priorities etc.   \n\n\nI think yall just have two different personalities. he seems a little happy go lucky, you seem very anal. idk man, probably not gonna work out, but he doesnt sound bad.", "Absolutely - OP NTA - GET OUT - he does not value you at ALL", "Thought the same thing. How is that not his own fault? Is he being held at gun point by a person very much against people being on time? If that's not within his control then what is?", "I\u2019m piggybacking off your advice bc I\u2019m seeking my own. My bf recently told me \u201cthis is who I am, and it\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve been right now\u201d about his depression. That was very concerning because I can\u2019t fix his depression, and I know that. Only he can. He expresses putting in effort to get out of his depression , but some days he just says \u201cthis is who I am. there\u2019s no changing it.\u201d I think he only says that on really bad days when he feels like nothing will get better, sort of being super dramatic in a sense, because other days hes more motivated to get better.\nbased on your advice about when you ask your partner to change, what should I do? I realize depression is more complex than asking someone to stop being so late all the time.", "I was thinking he's pissed about missing the sleepover because he expected sex, too. No sleepover, no sex -> tantrum", "Bwahahaha this is great!!!!", "He\u2019s also getting his winter tires removed in\u2026July", "His frontal lobe is completely developed, he\u2019s not gonna change \ud83d\ude02", "People that are late often, are expressing that they do not respect you, because they don't respect your time.", "Exactly! Being late so often shows a complete lack of respect for you. He's essentially saying whatever he's doing while making you wait is more important than you are. Rude and unacceptable.", "Yep, this exactly. I am one of those people - I am legitimately awful at being on time for things. It's not as bad as the bf in this situation, but any time I make plans (whether they're my plans or someone else's that I agreed to), there's about a 30-40% chance that I'll be late by a considerable amount. My friends are usually pretty chill about it, but I'm pretty certain most of my closer friends have made a mental note that any ETA's I give should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nBut the thing is - even though I have this unfortunate reputation for being a bit of a temporally-challenged airhead, I NEVER expect my friends or peers to just accept it as a fact of life. Whenever I'm running late, I always at least try to give semi-frequent updates on my ETA and keep communications up so I know if my friends decide to change their plans/move on without me due to my lateness (which would be 100% fair, and I'm always clear on that). When I eventually do arrive, I always make sure I apologize sincerely for being late. I suck at being on time, but there are things I know I can do to at least somewhat make up for it.\n\nAnd even with all of this, I'm fully aware that just communicating and apologizing doesn't make me a saint. My lateness is still a problem - it's inconvenient, feels somewhat disrespectful, and is something that I should be working on, not just shoving under the rug with copy + paste apologies and empty promises. My personal belief is that any negative personality trait (barring something truly abhorrent or criminal) can be excusable, if the person has the correct mentality and attitude of acknowledgment and self-improvement. The bf in this situation does not.", "RUN, don\u2019t walk away from this loser, RUN!!!!!\n\nHe will not change. He will not \u201cdo better\u201d.
