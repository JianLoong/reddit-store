My (27f) bf (26m) of 5 months has a chronic habit of being late. And by late I don\u2019t mean a few mins, I mean like at minimum an hour. Most of the time it doesn\u2019t really bother me because I\u2019m a homebody so it\u2019s not a big deal, but in cases where there\u2019s an event happening or we have somewhere to go, it\u2019s been very frustrating for me and I feel like I\u2019m becoming a nag about it. There has been 5 previous events/plans he has been late or bailed on completely, not including all the times he\u2019s just been late to hang out at my place. \n\nContext. I live alone, and he lives with his parents. I work a full time job that is moderately stressful, managing a disability. He is in university taking his bachelors part time, but he is off for the summer and has chosen not to work. \n\nLast night, my best friends were coming over for a watch party / pizza night type thing. My bf was going to come and sleepover after. The only thing he had to do that day was take his summer tires in to change over from his winters. I\u2019d told my bf what time they were coming (7) and that I was having a bit of a hard day with my disability, and he said that he wanted to arrive at least an hour before my friends arrived to spend time with me and relax for a bit after I was done work. I planned to walk my dog with him, maybe catch up, figure out dinner stuff etc. He said he was going to arrive between 5:30 and 6. At 5:20, I get a text that he\u2019s gonna take a shower and then be on his way. I text him around 5:50 asking what\u2019s up and nothing. At 6:20, he tells me he just got out of the shower. He finally arrives at 6:55, just before my friends. I told him I was upset about him being so late, and he made a joke about having to jerk off in the shower and that\u2019s why it took an hour. He was grumpy and quiet most of the evening which was awkward. When the evening ended, I\u2019d told him I didn\u2019t feel up to having a sleepover (he sleeps over about 4-5 times per week) and that I wanted my bed to myself. He got upset at me that I continue to bring up his lateness and said it was not his fault and he\u2019s not trying to be late but he just gets \u201clost in the sauce\u201d and left grumpy. I told him that I\u2019d repeatedly said how people being on time and showing up when they say they will is the easiest way to make me feel loved and cared about. He said he can\u2019t help it. However, I feel bad that I kicked him out.

Ask once, nicely, and explain the reason (when you are late it makes me feel like I'm not important, would you mind putting in effort not to be late, I'm happy to help if there is anything I can do). If they agree to change, it's okay to remind them once (i.e. \"You promised you wouldn't be late anymore. You were late today and it feels like you didn't even try. I don't want to nag, but you said you would try and this is really important to me, so can you please try to be on time?\")\n\nIf, at anytime they say something like \"this is who I am,\" or they fail to change after being reminded, stop. That's your sign they don't want to and aren't going to change. At that point, you either decided to end the relationship, or you accept who they are. You don't get to keep dating them and keep complaining about a character flaw they have shown that they are unwilling to change.", "NTA - it\u2019s obvious your boyfriend has no regard or respect for your time, seeing how he\u2019s so happy to waste it and then joke about it. He can help it, he\u2019s hoping you change your boundaries before he changes his bad habits. \n\nFlat out tell him that until he learns to appreciate you and your time, he\u2019s gotta operate on your schedule. If that\u2019s too hard for him, there\u2019s another girl out there willing to put up with it. \n\nGood for you holding to your boundaries.

Whose fault is it, or for what reason does he say causes it? Has he been evaluated for ADHD or something else that might be at the root of a lack of focus and executive functioning?", "NTA. He ***can*** help himself. I have known multiple chronically late individuals who I had to end relationships with because they never changed.

That unimportant thing suddenly has a voice, the horror. /'s.\nWhy are you putting up with his disrespect? You deserve better.", "NTA. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt until you got to the part where he said it wasn't his fault, and he thought masturbating in the shower was a legitimate reason.

You don't have to accept being at the literal bottom of his list.", "NTA.  He has no job and is on summer break.  There is zero reason for him to be late all the time, it's a lack of respect or thought.  Rather than deflecting all of the blame and making nasty jokes, does he ever apologize and actually take responsibility for his lateness?  Do you see him actually making any efforts at all to fix this pattern of behavior?\n\nLook, you've only been together for 5 months.

I still usually tell him appointment times that have a buffer built in just in case--and my expectations (and how I plan things) have lowered/changed significantly.  Fortunately, he is capable of being on time if I tell him something is super important and his specific line of work is pretty flexible on start times.

Maybe he's got untreated ADHD or something, but that is his issue to actively address to mitigate its impact on his life and your relationship. If he doesn't have ADHD he needs to grow up and become respectful of others' time and learn to plan ahead and maintain his time commitments (obviously with room for unexpected things to come up on occasion which can make someone late. jerking off in the shower is not that.

You need to break up with this man or it\u2019s going to ruin your relationship and derail your life.", "I've been stuck in traffic. I've been stuck working late. I've even been stuck on someone's porch once because they weren't home when I knocked and their mean ass dog wouldn't let me leave. Know what I've never been stuck doing? A completely optional recreational activity with an off switch that delivers entertainment on demand and saves my progress if I stop before the end of the video so I can come back to it at any time without missing anything. What he did was choose to watch YouTube rather than fulfill his obligations to you. Always remember, wherever YouTube is on this guy's list of priorities, you are at least one step lower. Probably three, because he also gets distracted by soap and can't find his socks.\n\nEdit: NTA", "\"stuck watching YouTube\" is pretty much saying \"I didn't want to show up on time\"", "I had a partner who was so chronically late, that if I needed to be here anywhere at a certain time, I\u2019d tell her to show up half an hour before the time actually was. And she\u2019d still be an hour late. Shed say things like \u201cI think my ADHD is just always going to make me late for the rest of my life\u201d, proving that she has no respect for herself or for my time. This type of behavior will derail your life if it\u2019s allowed to continue. I have ADHD as well, but I am never late because I budget time and set alarms and don\u2019t waste my time masturbating. This guy is a total loser.", "Yep, which is why OP is NTA.", "You're exactly right. Personally, I prefer partnership over parenting another adult.", "No, that was him trying to be clever and get her to laugh it off. I don't think him cracking that joke necessarily makes that a historically accurate version of events.", "I suffer from some level of time blindness. I have strategies for dealing with it, for instance a shower playlist that I know is 15 minutes long. If the playlist ends and I'm still in the shower, I know to wrap it up and get out. I do this because the shower is one of the places I am most likely to lose all track of time.\n\nTime Blindness is a thing, but you don't get to use it as a crutch while making life difficult for your partner and disrespecting THEIR time at every turn.", "I have that and yet I don\u2019t use it as a excuse to be a late AH. I manage it because I\u2019m aware of it.", "As someone who deals with it, once you get to 26 its only an excuse occasionally. \n\nYou should have things in place to make sure you aren't horribly late consistently.\n\n5-15 minutes is understandable but hours late is only understandable occasionally as yes sometimes your methods fail.", "Yes! Oops didn\u2019t realize I forgot the judgement, thank you.", "No, give him another chance. You can fix him. Remember how he makes you feel. Blah blah blah.", "Are we sure he was joking though? Doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019d be out of character for him based on OP\u2019s comments", "I get that, i used to be a huge problem to my family because of this, but some people just never learn what is wrong with them.\n\nwhen i was younger, i really believed i was just lazy and unorganized, used to be constantly late, and not even realize that I'm late. That only changed when i actually knew what my specific problem was and how to deal with it. it took me months to actually find what works for me even though i know the problem. medication is also a huge part. \n\nmy comment was more towards the person acting like time blindness is not a thing and people are just lazy\n\nRegarding the post, i think that the best solution is to find out whether he has a serious problem or just a dick.", "yes, but not everyone is able to manage it. I'm aware of it, and yet it's still hard. i mean i feel absolutely bad if I'm late and i explain exactly why I'm late, but it's still and illness you have to dealt with and sometimes it's ok to use it as an excuse.\n\nAND some people do not know they have this problem so without medication or learning the proper way it works for them it's never going to get better", "i think the problem is here that they just don't know whether they are dealing with a problem like time blindness or not.\n\ni got diagnosed when i was 15 , so at a bigger age i know  now how to properly organize my time and only be late like occasionally on more difficult days.\n\nmy mom in the other hand got diagnosed at 45.... so now at a old age she is still very disorganized and dealing with it is more difficult for her than me, because she lived with it for so long and just didn't know anything else.\n\nthey need to find out what's the problem and then go from there"]}
