This is not a popular position but when someone marries a person with a child they are agreeing to treat that child like they would their own. That does not require everyone in their lives to do the same. You are required to treat your step grandchild with respect and kindness - but you are not required to treat them the same as your grandchild.", "NTA - you asked your son about this and he gave the okay. He probably could have done a better job managing this with his step daughter. But, you are not an AH here\n\n*Info - did you ask the parents before you bought all this?*\n\nEdit - updating judgment", "NTA because that\u2019s your granddaughter you are not required to spend thousands on his step child , the mother should reach out to her family and see if they can help , it\u2019s not favoritism because it\u2019s not like both girls came to u at the same time and u just bought one and even u did that is your grandchild", "It's a sensitive issue, no doubt. Maybe there's a way to help out in a less financially burdensome way that still shows care for your step-grandchild?", "NTA this isn't a in your face present it's for school. It's nice of you to do. As a parent I would be grateful and no I would not ask for something for my other children if they did not need it. I think your response as a little harsh and could of told Dil this was decided by you and the father because she needed it. If there is something you need for your child just ask don't be rude and demanding. I also don't agree with the sharing. It's her computer that she can use at anytime now if step needs it then like adults revisit the topic.", "Do both parents work?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t remarry a woman with a child, your son did. You aren\u2019t responsible for providing the same things to the stepdaughter that you do your granddaughter. But it is a good idea to be aware of how it will be perceived & the effect it will have on your granddaughter. I\u2019m sure she is being shamed & guilted by her stepmom & stepdaughter. Plus your son might be pressured to take it away from her. In short, giving gifts like that can cause a lot of unnecessary drama. She\u2019ll be 18 in four years. You can give expensive gifts then.", "I think you knew subconsciously these gifts were going to cause a problem.  For the price of one MacBook, you could have bought two HPs or Dells. And you knew that too. The step has been in the picture for seven years?? You must dislike the child, the mother, the in-laws or all of them. YTA.", "ESH - both girls have the same issue. Maybe you should have declared it a family gift so the girls could share. Too late now", "Why did you buy a MACBOOK instead of two less expensive laptops? You could have helped both children. YTA.", "Well\u2026technically NTA because Clara\u2019s stepsister has two other sets of biological grandparents and because you talked to your son about it first.\n\nBut it would have been far kinder to get less expensive equipment and given at least something to your step-granddaughter. You\u2019re not obligated to provide for her, it\u2019s true but it would have been kinder.", "NTA and you are right the other child has grandparents to help. What the hell is with blended families holding out their hands me to with the other family. Chances are if the shoe was on the other foot she'd not give her step-child anything then argue it came from biological grandparents. To boot Clara needed it for school and could start to fail at classes without a computer. I can imagine grandma saying sorry Clara but since I couldn't afford two phones and two computers I have to let you struggle in school. I'm sorry they may be a blended family but they do have their own biological family too to help... Where is the step-child's dad?", "NTA - 16 is old enough to get a PT job.", "YTA. Spending thousands on one of your grandchildren and not the other is shithouse. Family isn\u2019t just blood", "Info: \n-Why can\u2019t they share? I had to share with my brother computer until we left for college.

Would Clara\u2019s bio grand parents buy your bio grandchild the same level of gifts as the bought her?", "\"Money is tight but we bought into Apple's ecosystem\" yeah right... YTA. \n\nA second-life pro grade computer that is entirely enough for a 14yo cost around 300$. Thinkpads last forever and are easily upgradable, not like Macbook that go \"vintage\" after a few years and no longer get software updates and the likes. \nBasically you've set your granddaughter on a path were she'll have to shell out a lot of money to stay on the system she has learned to use, which is a stupid move when her financial background is unstable.\n\nSo either you've received super bad advice from a salesperson (I hope for them they were on commission) or you decided to pick up the priciest computer you could get, which definitely make you the asshole. \n\nYou can decide not to treat your son step-kid as your grandchild if you so wish, although I think after so long it is a cruel message to send, but you could have done it without being so blatantly obvious and show-offy.", "Showing favoritism like that makes YTA. Next time get them something they can share or something for each.", "YTA big time! How cruel you are.

All this does is serve to divide people more. I get the position you have but imagine how awful this kid feels? They have been a part of this family and you straight up have no accepted them to the same level you have accepted the biological grandchild. \n\nI can\u2019t force you to like the 15yo kid but I can comfortably say what you did would hurt any normal human being. I think you should consider treating this child as family, not some token that is just there. \n\nIf I have to call someone the AH, YTA", "YTA for buying incredibly expensive gifts for your granddaughter without discussing it with her parents first, causing dissension in your son\u2019s home, driving a wedge between the two girls, and not giving a name to your step granddaughter.", "NTA. I don't understand how people just want you to accept a random child as your own just because your son did so. She is your son's STEP daughter who has her own set of grandparents. You can love her as a granddaughter, but if you do not feel like she is, she is not. Simple as that. Again, just because your son accepted her, does not mean you have to as well.", "NTA\n\nBlended families need to take care not to expect their extended families to see their step-children quite the way they'd like them to regardless of their reasoning, bit it good or bad. You took care of an important thing for your granddaughter and had no responsibility to provide anything to your DIL's child, as you so aptly pointed out.

She already has to share everything. If she wants to keep a few things only to herself then it's her choice and we need to respect it. It's also a personal item so it's understandable that she doesn't want to share", "Is that really relevant?

Why should the OP deprive their own grandchild? The OP didn\u2019t ask for a step-grandchild, yet are now responsible for their upkeep and well-being?", ">you have shown huge favoritism to your grandchild and gave NOTHING to the other grandchild.\n\nWhy do you think people can't decide for themselves who their family is and, as soon as one person makes a choice, everyone in their life has to take on a responsibility?

I suppose I cannot force someone to consider the non biological kid their grandchild but I think any human should see how doing what the op did could be extremely hurtful. Especially if this child has thought they were close to these grandparents. I suppose we don\u2019t know if that is the case, however.", "If money is tight that\u2019s all the more reason to really do your research before buying something.

Or is that not the goal in BLENDED families?\n\n>Even that aside, does every single person have to get two of everything now so the step-kid doesnt get upset?\n\nWe're talking about top of the line equipment that Clara's parents cannot afford to source for their other child, and this is your argument? \n\n>When its Clara\u2019a bday does the other kid get presents too?\n\nWas it Clara's birthday here?? Are we talking about birthdays??? Once again, it's not just any old random laptop, it's a brand new Macbook and other gadgets that, again, the other child does not receive. That seems totally fair to you??? To do to a teenager??? Yet me calling an adult out on it is too harsh?? Yeah your priorities are \ud83d\udcaf", "Its a macbook - not a new car.
