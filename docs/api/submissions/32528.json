I was spending a lot of time after school to use the iMac in the school library until the library closed (it stayed open for 2 hours after school ended). This was affecting my home life because I was expected to be home to babysit my step sibs every day after school.

The best compromise would have been to buy a \"family\" computer and get both girls a pre-paid wireless phone. \n\nBUT...if they are hurting that much for money, there are government programs out there that will get them phones and computers.

They took my little brother to DisneyWorld for his kindergarten graduation. They spoiled my little siblings extravagantly and then one time when I was thirteen, I asked. I asked the big question. Why? Why did they treat us so differently. They said that I had my own grandparents and if they didn't love me, not their problem. I did have my dad's parents.

One.\n\nI remember my grandfather actually saying \"we don't do family in halves or by steps\" - meaning once they're family, they're family and are treated as such by everyone. I don't ever remember anyone ever acting differently.\n\nThis idea that you don't need to treat children fairly just because you didn't choose for their parent to join the family is as assholish as it comes. Your kid chose their parent. Your kid made them family. Now be a fucking adult and treat those kids like family.\n\nI'm a grandmother. My kids have dated people with children. I could never imagine treating any of those innocent souls differently just because I didn't \"choose\" their parent.", "My immediate reaction was that they could have helped out both kids with cheaper options for the price of a macbook. There's no reason to give that to a 14 year old if money is tight already.", "Fr being a step child who's bio side didn't give a shit about them was already hard. I still have issues about being loved and wanted. If my dad (step) and his family didn't treat me the same as my sisters, I would have been devastated. A kid didn't decide to be born of 2 parents, and then they split. Why does the child have to coni tue to suffer because of the parents' decisions? What's wrong with people?! That's her grandchild, too! Holy shit, people are terrible. For one second, think about that kid and what they may be going through. Good grief.", "Agree. \n\nDoes nobody have empathy for the step kid who now has to watch their sibling play on a new MacBook? This is not okay.", "EXACTLY THIS. The whole situation is bad, and the OP set it up. Technically, she can do as she pleases with her money, but she can't deny that she's setting up an unhealthy relationship between her, DIL, and the step-granddaughter. She's also creating a bad relationship between her step-granddaughter and bio-granddaughter. Despite the marriage that binds these families, she's also made it obvious that she does not see DIL or step-granddaughter as her family. So, no, she's not a jerk for buying the gifts; she's the AH for not considering the larger context of the family's needs and dynamics AND then doubling down on her biological offspring preference as her defense.", "My mom was adopted by her dad\u2019s sister. My brothers and I were not treated the same as the other grandkids were. They were our \u201cgrandparents\u201d our whole life but weren\u2019t cared about the same. We don\u2019t have any type of relationship anymore.", ">the lack of boomer empathy is the biggest problem here.\n\nIt's all that lead paint they ate as kids, not a lot of functioning brain cells after that, unfortunately.", "Jesus I only just noticed that. That really says it all", "Yeah I was on the fence until that comment. All of my kids are adopted and the bio families we\u2019re able to be in contact with treat them all like their own. I see the argument for getting one child something they need and not getting another child that thing because they may not need it at the moment, but that comment was just so unnecessary.", "I will never understand how on earth the son/DIL's reaction is a surprise.", "Yea exactly. For the price of even the cheapest macbook you could easily get 2 decent non-mac laptops.", "I bet the phone is an iphone, and matching earbuds of course.", "After SEVEN YEARS with these disgusting people, of course she does.", "And her granddaughter is self absorbed like her. She can't even share \u2620\ufe0f. What is worse is that they were low on money, so they didn't even have a computer! \n\nNow they have a teenager with a MacBook and another with NOTHING and no money to buy anything close to that. And that little asshole that knows how shitty it is not having a computer and being bullied for it is doing the same... to her sibling. YIKES.\n\nMy son wouldn't dare to pull son crap like that with his sibling. Thank God this kind crap doesn't happen in my family. I would have sold all that and bought cheaper stuff for both if he acted so poorly. Their parents should do something to make it right since OP tried so hard to make drama.", "While you make valid points, I think extended family don\u2019t understand the harm they do with their \u201cgood intentions.\u201d  Blended families are complicated and harder for the members in them to navigate than traditional nuclear families.  There\u2019s a lot of considerations, with respect to what are the custody arrangements, how involved are the stepkids other families etc.\n\nWhile there is certainly no obligation to consider your step grandchildren, if the kids are close in age and predominantly raised in the same household, imagine the hurt and/ or jealousy that may be created by OP \u201cgood intentions\u201d of helping only her granddaughter and showering her with expensive flashy gifts (sorry, but a MacBook is not a \u201cneed\u201d that a $300 Chromebook couldn\u2019t fulfill for most high school students).\n\nGreat, the granddaughter feels loved and has stuff.  But now has to deal with her step sibling naturally feeling badly (and potentially acting poorly and with animosity) over the inequity.  This in turn is going to frustrate and possibly hurt the DIL.  So now DIL and OP\u2019s husband have friction in their relationship if they weren\u2019t on the same page about these expensive gifts and prepared to try to make things equitable among their blended family.\n\nYes.  Absolutely, OP doesn\u2019t OWE her DIL and Step grandchild anything.  But if they loved their son, they should be thoughtful about making choices that are empathetic to and inclusive of son and DIL\u2019s blended family situation and not create unnecessary strife and conflict through their \u201cgood intentions.\u201d  OP said she cleared this with her son, and if that is true, the  bad on him for not discussing with his wife so they had a plan for how to deal with how to make sure there was a plan for creating some equity between the kids (purchasing the second laptop/ phone themselves or DIL asking her extended family to pitch in) but dropping a Macbook, iphone, and headphones into a home with siblings of the same age and no plan on the parents part for making things somewhat equitable is obviously going to create significant conflict and impact relationships.", "Your grandkids are also \u201crandom kids\u201d, asshole.", "So what if your adult son adopted a 7 year old child and he had a biological child as well? Would you not consider them BOTH your grandchildren?", "Yeah, you sound like an AH to me", "To me this is odd - they are family.  Family is family.  Unless someone treats you like shit, why exclude them?\n\nLike my niece and nephews - I treat them all equally even though I'm only actually related to my sister's kids.  I'm not related to my husband's brother's kids.\n\nSo should I exclude one set of kids from gifts and affection just because they're \"some random kids that my husband's brother had\"?\n\nMaybe some people do, I don't know.  My family doesn't.  I don't.  All my nieces and nephews are treated the same.  I give them all comparable gifts (per their ages; there is a significant age gap between the two sets of kids).  I save the same amount for college for each of them.  All my aunts and uncles treated me the same regardless if they were my blood relative or my blood relative's spouse.\n\nMaybe my family is unusually inclusive?  I dunno.", "Why favor a random bio grandchild that your child decided to have.  You didn't choose to have that grandchild.    I don't get the I didn't choose my kids marriage that came with a child.  You didn't choose to have a grandchild either.  Why support one choice because it's biological and not the other?", "Yeah, fuck that child!", "Obviously, and understandably (to a degree) the DIL would like to see grandchild/step grandchild equality and there's nothing wrong with that if it's feasible from both sides of field.\n\nWhile I do understand there's no obligation to equalize spending on a step grandchild and one is naturally inclined to favor their own grandchild over a step grandchild but this isn't a case of either. This is more not my family not my problem. This is how you alienate someone from a family. A MacBook, phone, headphones, and I forget the 4th item compared to absolutely nothing. Oh hey grandchild come eat this 5 star, 3 course meal but you, you can watch cuz you're not mine. It's bordering on a Cinderella-like storyline. \n\nA $50 gift card in a card with a little note 'hey we couldn't get you what we got so and so but we didn't want you to feel completely left out' would make a world of a difference here.", "Why would you favor the other random kid, who is only in your life because your kid had sex with their other parent??\n\nIt doesn't matter how children come into our lives. Once they are a part of the family, you at least make an effort to acknowledge them\n\nDoes it need to be absolutely equal? Of course not. But in a situation like this, just the phone alone would have been a huge present for the bio grandchild. They could have made the laptop a shared gift, and gotten headphones for both. Why on earth wouldn't they do that??", "I'm kind of leaning this way too. Are Stepgranddaughter's grandparents making sure that Clara is getting equal gifts to what they give their GD?", "Because you cause resentment in the family to fester. If I was the stepmother in this situation I would absolutely reciprocate your logic and focus only on my daughter and not yours bio kid. This is assuming your bio kid flaunts her gifts in our faces and refuses to share.", "Yeah, if money is tight then they really shouldn\u2019t being buying a Macbook.  Far cheaper PC\u2019s to be found.", ">Basically you've set your granddaughter on a path were she'll have to shell out a lot of money to stay on the system she has learned to use, which is a stupid move when her financial background is unstable.\n\nI've been using Apple computers since the 80s. I promise you, it doesn't debilitate anyone from being able to use Windows, too.", "Totally agree.  Yta.   There was zero need to get a Mac for a teen to do homework on.  Could have bought 2 basic pcs or tablets.   Apples are a waste of money for the vast majority if you need something to cover basics.

If the son said this was ok, well he is part of the problem.   And his wife should be mad at him.  Him making that computer used in a common space and prioritizing it for homework makes sense in their household.", "Hmm I\u2019m  not so sure the newer Apple silicon is gonna degrade as fast as the intel based Mac\u2019s. I mean that\u2019s kinda how it is with all computers to an extent. My iPhone 8 is still getting security updates.", "Yep. YTA simply for buying the most expensive computer you possibly could.  Zero reason a high school kid needs that. Plus you could have bought 2 or 3 better computers for the same damn price.  Instead they 100% went for 'show-offy'.  \n\nBut \"money is tight\".  OK", "Macbook pros last decades. That trash lasts two years. OP made the right investment.", "Had apple gone downhill? I remember getting the first or second iphone and I used it for 8 years. My mom had a MacBook for 10. The only reason I switched to Samsung is we got a family plan and it was the best deal.", "Plus a phone because other kids were making fun of her for not having a phone. That\u2019s not a school need. And I\u2019m curious what phone that was \u2014 iPhone 15 to go with the MacBook?", "Sorry but:\n\n>Clara needed it. The stepgranddaughter wants it just because Clara has it? Or does she truly need it as well?\n\nDo you really think Clara needed a macbook, phone, and headphones?\n\nDo you really think that if Clara did actually NEEDED a phone, computer, and headphones for school, that the other girl who lives in the same home and presumably attends the same school wouldn't ALSO need those same resources?\n\n>Are they treating both children equally?\n\nWho gives a shit? Has no one in this thread ever learned the concept of basic decency? 2 wrongs don't make a right? What does it matter how the other side of the family behaves? You don't do the right thing only if someone else is doing the right thing, if you do, then newsflash, you're an asshole.\n\nThis logic is so goofy.", "Sure. But actions have consequences. Don\u2019t be surprised if you destroy your relationship with your child\u2019s entire family if you play favorites amongst their kids.", "This is on the parents. It's them who've blended. OP did everything right, they asked the father. \n\nHe should know his family and if it was an issue could have said \"I appreciate the thought, but this is affecting my step daughter as well, I wonder if you would buy a computer for the family instead so they can both use it for school\"", "I really see it as the dad showing some favoritism. If he was thinking about his blended family and the happiness of the family all together he would have quickly realized the contention it would cause in their house if one girl got this crazy gift and the other didn't.

Their other parent and that parent\u2019s family are going to gift the child things and have experiences with them the stepchild won\u2019t.

Ideally it balances out in the end and overall the parents have been fair but if one kid needs a computer for school and the other doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s a rare and wealthy family that can afford to buy 2 just out of fairness or give the other some other gift of equal value for no reason", "This exactly, I was going to post myself but you've reflected my opinion very accurately", "I did not come from blended family, so take this opinion with a grain of salt. \n\nI think whether OP is an AH or not depend on the relationship she (he?) has with the step-granddaughter.

Three points: fundamally life is not fair. Someone is always better looking, smarter, more athletic, has more material things, etc. This is a fact of life. Always and forever. \n\nSecond: it is not justice to force equity and call that being fair. Just because granddaughter and stepgranddaughter get the same gifts does not make it \"fair\". It sure wouldn'tbe \"fair\" to granddaughter. Granddaughter did not choose to be a stepsister and grandma did not chose to have a step granddaughter.

Also, the grandparents aren\u2019t \u201crequired\u201d to support the step-grandchild, but it\u2019s a kind and generous thing to do.

So, again without crying or making a scene, I had to tell them that I didn't get any gifts. \n\nI never had the same feelings for my grandparents again. It wasn't about the gifts themselves, it was about them showing me how little I meant to them. \n\nSo, OP yeah YTA. You could have done better.", "Absolutely agree with everything and so well said!.

If her son is married and he has a kid, that\u2019s his kid. Which makes it her grandchild. And it definitely is going to cause her to resent that part of the family which won\u2019t be good. Saddens me that she can\u2019t learn to consider that her DIL and step grandchild are her family now, biological or not.

Which is fine if you've got the cash, but absolutely ridiculous if you don't have lots of money to throw around. At about grand for an air, multiple grand for the pro? OP could have gotten two perfectly functional cheap laptops -- chromebook, linux, windows -- and had money left over. It's a bit like saying \"I couldn't afford to buy *both* kids a car\" when you gift the one kid a Lambo. Unless OP scored a cheap refurb, I call AH for this alone.", "Very well said", "I want to know- if Clara is struggling because of family finances, is her step sister ALSO struggling? Does her sister gave a phone or computer for school work?\n\n Would there have been a way to buy more affordable gear (teenagers do NOT need a macbook and that's one of the most expensive laptops you can buy outside of gaming gear!) but get BOTH of them a computer and phone that se adequate for their needs for the next few years. Not necessarily alone but working with the parents and maybe even step parents.\n\n\nI dont think treating only one child is wise - when the parents married they BOTH became your grandchildren.", "Be appreciative to get anything. The grandparents didn\u2019t ask for extra children.", "That grandmother is not obligated to do the same for the stepchild. She is taking care of her grandchild. OP did the best she could. She had to take the money out of savings to provide the supplies the granddaughter NEEDED. The mother needs to talk to her child\u2019s father and grandparents to see if they can help provide the other girl with what she needs. Life is NOT equal  everyone gets a different shake in life. This woman\u2019s granddaughter will do without other things that the stepdaughter will get. You don\u2019t know how much OP sacrificed to purchase what she did. The DIL has no right to be mad about it. She should be grateful that that is leads they have to take care of", "This!! I also noticed the lack of a fake name. Also the \u201c\u2026ask her child\u2019s grandparents\u2026\u201d First off, that isn\u2019t \u201cher child\u201d, that\u2019s OP\u2019s son\u2019s child too. And \u201cher child\u2019s grandparents\u201d included OP and OP\u2019s spouse, if they have one. \n\nJust because a child is a stepchild or step grandchild doesn\u2019t make them any less of the family than biologically related children and grandchildren. Ffs, If you want a blended family to work, you got to actually recognize them as family.  \n\nOP, absolutely beyond a doubt YTA. I can\u2019t believe you can\u2019t see that or even did this in the first place. No person in their right mind would spend thousands of dollars on one child in a family and not a cent on the other child.\n\nEspecially, a grandparent buying school supplies for a grandchild in a family that cannot afford the supplies themselves. If the 14 year old is having trouble because of not having a laptop for school, I can almost bet that the 15 year old is having trouble because of not having a laptop for school. Plus, not only did OP buy the 14 year old a laptop but not the 15 year old, they bought the 14 year old a phone and other school things. \n\nOP, I hope you realize how much of a massive AH you are and rectify your grand mistake.", "In fairness, they do mention that the stepgranddaughter has her own grandparents.  We also don't know how long they've known the other girl.  If this marriage is recent they've got no relationship with this new kid.\n\nYou get married.  Your whole extended family doesn't. \n\nExpecting the other grandparents to provide for the other kid is reasonable.  They said they aren't rich, so they weren't in a position to buy two sets of stuff.  So the only other option was to *not* but their grandkid anything for the sake of fairness.  \n\nWhat's your solution to fix the mistake?  Take the stuff away from the 14 year old?", "And that's assuming that the other set of grandparents have the financial means to help.", "I'm only calling out the \"gifts for no reason\" statement, not suggesting what should have been done.", "Chrome book can be $150, MacBook is $1000 ish, could\u2019ve bought them both a chrome book and a cheap phone for less than the cost of the MacBook.

My kids are awesome. :)", "Yeah she is trying to alienate him too. We haven't talked in years because distance and time but when he got a hold of me I instantly jumped to help. I told him I would write a letter and notarize. Funny thing they weren't married too long and the bio dad was a huge dead beat.", "That\u2019s just deliberately shitty of them. It\u2019s so easy to favor one child without stomping on another child, if you simply must get more and better for your bio-grandkids. $7 Barbie for one, the special edition $20 Barbie for the other. $10 Lego set for one and deluxe $30 set for the other. Used sheets? Fuck right off. So mean. I\u2019m sorry.", "I feel bad for the step daughter.  She's the same-ish age and lives in the same house.  If the daughter didn't have a computer to do school work, wouldn't the step daughter have the same problem?  It's not just the favoritism that bleeds through, it's the act of giving one child a resource/educational advantage while letting the other swing in the wind.  I know that's not OP's problem, it just makes my heart hurt a bit for the step daughter.", "They really suck! I met my step-grandparents as an adult and rarely get to see them, but they still will send me a gift card or dog themed bracelet for Christmas. \n\n....I'm going to go look into sending them flowers or something...", "What did your grandparents give your siblings?", "This was me, my brother and sister growing up. My step dad\u2019s mom and entire family (except one uncle) made it glaringly obvious that we were not considered family. My step brother would get all sorts of cool shit for Christmas and birthdays and we\u2019d get Dollar Store items if anything at all. My uncle got us $5 beanies from Walgreens one year and got my step brother a skateboard lol.\n\nAs we\u2019ve gotten older it\u2019s spread to our kids; that side of the family absolutely cannot stand that my stepdad has three grandkids he ADORES and none of them are from his biological son (by choice).

(My nephew is now married and the children are officially his stepkids.)\n\n  \nI now make sure that all the kids get the same for Christmas and birthdays. (One nephew has three 'birth' children - for want of a better expression; the other has two stepchildren.)", "I can almost understand granny not thinking of that since she doesn\u2019t seem too in touch with the in-home dynamics, but it\u2019s crazy that dad didn\u2019t see this coming. How clueless is he? This was prompted by a have vs have-not situation at school, but now it\u2019s shifted to the home with Clara becoming a \u2018have\u2019 with a bunch of expensive status symbols while step-sis remains a \u2018have-not\u2019. It\u2019s very unkind. \n\nObviously OP can do what she wants with her money, but it should have been very apparent the problems this would cause at home.", "Why did families struggling get the most expensive laptop possible???

They treated all the kids the same, or had a relationship with none of them.", "Exactly why I'm going with ESH", "Exactly, mac books are expensive they could have gotten 2 cheaper laptops.

Because I think we still have the question of what *are* the stepchild\u2019s resources. She could be in the exact same boat as Clara, that\u2019s true, but she might not be. I have seen more than one half sibling (in OPs case, it\u2019ll be stepsiblings) who has stuff and doesn\u2019t see a problem with their sibling not having stuff\u2026until the sun gets something better. Stepsis might well have had a laptop and phone from her dad or other grandparents or from herself even, and is only upset now because Clara has newer versions. I think we\u2019d need a better picture of that.", "I think the new wife is the one who was short sighted with unrealistic expectations of grandparents who have a real attachment to a biological grandchild, who will always be their grandchild, whether the parents divorced or not, having a child marry into a family and then expect relatives to have the same affections is unrealistic. I am married into a family with a son, and never expected for one minute for the new grandparents to treat my son the same as their own grandchildren.", "Especially if Clara needs it for schoolwork, does the stepsister also need it for schoolwork?

No. But it's still avoidable shittiness.", "I\u2019m a Mom in a blended family. We have worked hard: ALL of us, including grandparents on both sides, to make sure our boys feel they are loved equally. \n\nMy opinion is because of my lives experience.", ">This is just the reality of blended families. You choose to become a stepparent but you can\u2019t force people in your life to do the same.\n\nThat is, unfortunately, true. I chose to become a step mother and I cannot expect from my family to view both, step and biological children the same. And, truth be told, the question about the other grandparents is not unreasonable, both of the kids probably have two sets of them (of course, assuming they are alive and in a good health, hopefully).   \n\n\nBut, even though I believe OP is not the asshole (adding NTA) for judgement), TA here is her son. If his parents were willing to provide such a generous gift to his daughter, then he needed to sit down with his wife and create a plan how to do the same for his step daughter. Or just to ask OP to buy something less expensive, so he could afford a match.", "I'm not arguing with you that this isn't just another version of normal in those circumstances.\n\nBut, no way in hell it would happen in my family. My SIL came with a child from her first marriage. A wonderful, sweet, smart and funny little girl. That little girl is my niece. My baby. Period. She's my baby too.", "Because one causes the other.
