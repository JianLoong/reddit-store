The girls have been wanting to do a spa day so we did a at home one last night. \n\nWell everything was going good my daughter and I both had are hair in high pony tails. Niece wanted her hair like ours too. Niece has curly hair they\u2019re more loose curls but it\u2019s still curly. My brother always says not to touch niece\u2019s hair I thought he was just being dramatic. \n\nWell I started brushing it to put up and it got poofy fast. I didn\u2019t not what to do so I just left it. Well when my brother came to pick her up. He seen her hair and asked what happened I explained how niece wanted a high ponytail like us and I tried to put it up but that happened. My brother was visibly upset. He said this is why I didn\u2019t want you to ever do anything with her hair, you don\u2019t realize how hard it is to take care of curly hair. \n\nI thought he was just being over dramatic and told him he needs to chill out and it\u2019ll be okay.

YTA.\n\nNever, ever, EVER brush dry curly hair. It causes the curls to break up and poof out into frizz, but worst of all, the curls also get extremely tangled, which can result in a lengthy and painful wash day. And if her hair is fine this may cause breakage. Textured haircare is no joke. You should've listened to your brother.", "YTA\n\nHe gave you a very specific instruction regarding the care of his child. You thought that you knew better and disregarded his instruction. How, on earth could you not be the A H here?", "YTA. When someone gives you instructions there's usually a reason why they have you those instructions. Especially when it's about their own children. Come on, you know you were the asshole here, don't you?", "YTA\n\nCurly hair is so difficult to deal with. I\u2019m white with curly hair and I only comb it on wash day. I do not brush my hair because my hair poofs. You can do a high pony tail with curly hair (practically every 80\u2019s movie proves this). You just needed to gather up her hair, not brush it.", "YTA.\n\nThere should be a way to compile every post here concerning curly hair because you need to do a deep dive into why this matters.", "YTA for touching her hair. Apologize and ask if it's ok for you to learn how to do her hair.  Please, always approach this gently and take \"no\" for an answer. Niece shouldn't feel excluded or othered for her hair/ being biracial. She just wants to be one of the girls. There's room for compromise here.  Educate yourself. There's tons of videos on YouTube from white moms showing their learning experiences with their kids textured hair.  Give it some time and approach this topic again with your brother, away from your niece. If he says it's ok, and she's OK with you learning with her, get some good product for her hair. Be patient, and take your cues from her.  It can be a great bonding experience or a childhood trauma for her.  That depends on you, her dad and her.", "YTA the father of the child told you in a very explicit way that you can't touch her hair. You have to apologize is really a big deal", "YTA - When you get explicit instructions from a parent about their child, you follow those instructions. It is really as simple as that. You don't get to just decide that another person is being \"dramatic\" and disregard what they say.\n\nTake responsibility for you actions, apologize to your brother, do better in the future.", "YTA. I suggest if you are going to have a spa day with your niece, you learn how to take care of her hair. Then run what you are considering doing by her dad before doing it.

The parent's \"no\" should have been all that you needed to follow. \n\nTwo, you do not know how to take care of curly hair, you may have damaged her hair by brushing it and not just 'made it poofy' \n\nYou should have said to her \"sorry sweetie, I don't have the stuff to he able to do your hair, we can talk to your dad and see about it\" and then you could educate yourself on how to do her hair by asking her dad about it, and then if he says it would be ok to educate yourself on how to do her hair, so when you watch her you can not fuck up again. If he says no you respect the no. If he says ok you make sure you dive deep into how to do and take care of curly hair before you touch her hair again.

You were specifically told never to brush it. You did what you wanted, and now the dad and the child are going to have to work to undo what you've done.

I'm a white woman who never had to deal with curly hair, but even I know that it's totally different and not just brush it and done. \n\nFor your niece's sake.

Get her to flip her head down and simply pull it all in a big loose high ponytail. What you did probably caused breakage and disrupted the curl pattern as well as being pretty painful for the child.

Your dismissiveness of her *father\u2019s* concerns and warnings about her hair is extremely disrespectful\u2014both to your brother, SIL, and your niece. Yes, afrotextured hair, curly hair, natural hair, mixed hair, etc IS A BIG DEAL. It can take a ton of careful maintenance and attention to make sure the hair is healthy and undamaged. You, ignorant, likely damaged your niece\u2019s hair and it most definitely hurt. \n\nMy hair is curly but not afrotextured and you do NOT take a dry brush to it\u2014it HURTS. The curls tangle with each other WHILE being brushed, and it\u2019s worse the tighter the curls are. My cousin is mixed and I\u2019d watch her white mother tear through her hair with a dry brush to force it into a \u201cneat\u201d high pony. My poor cousin would be in tears from pain because her mom never learned how to properly take care of black hair. My sister is also mixed, but our parents learned how to take care of her hair after years of trial and error with different hair care products. \n\nFurthermore, not only is there an active and physical part of taking care of natural hair, there\u2019s also a *huge cultural importance.* Hair is extremely important to the black community, especially to black women, as a form of history, culture, and self expression that is often policed, demeaned, diminished, and shamed by racism, societal bias, and nonblack people who refuse to learn. \n\nYour mentality that her hair is \u201cnot a big deal,\u201d makes you part of the problem in black hair not being taken seriously. And on top of that, your mentality is extremely problematic as you\u2019re downplaying the wishes of a parent towards their kid. If you don\u2019t apologize and learn from this, your brother and SIL aren\u2019t going to trust you with their kid. Is this the hill you want to die on? Do you want to strain or destroy your relationship with your niece because YOU personally don\u2019t think her hair is a big deal? Is it so hard to just say \u201cokay, I won\u2019t touch her hair\u201d and leave it be? YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. Her hair care needs are vastly different. TBH if she needs a protective style now you should be the one paying for it.", "YTA. You didn't even bother to look at how to work with her hair. You messed it up and left it that way for her father to deal with. \n\nI'm white as can be but I have watched YouTube videos on working with textured hair. (I am amazed at how much WORK and TIME it takes to get a good hairstyle for these women.) 98% of Caucasian people don't know how to work with non-caucasian hair. \n\nCheck out Elite Hair Care USA on YouTube. You will see EXACTLY what it takes to work with textured hair.", "YTA. Sounds like I have the same background and hair as your niece. It hurts and causes frizz to brush it dry like that. It also causes long term damage and tangling because her hair is likely fine. You were given instructions not to mess with her hair. It is well known that black and textured hair often needs different care. Why would you ignore the instructions from her parent? You might not think hair is a big deal, but it is for many black/biracial people.", "YTA - Curly hair is an special kind of hair, my daughters hair is curly, i CANT, ME the father, i CANT comb her hair, i cant do a ponytail, because is different than straight hair. my wife hair ir curly and she is an \"expert\"!, the only thing i can do to her is the sleeping pony tail (bc it doesnt matter if its made correctly or not)", "NAH.  Lesson learned.  Next time you go up against curly hair, do a messy ponytail ie, no brush, no comb, minimal use of fingers, bobby pins or clips if necessary.  Siblings bicker, so if this is normal, fine otherwise maybe apologize and let him know you learned your lesson.", "YTA.  I really cringed when you not only messed up her hair but refused to apologize.", "You're an ass for going against what her dad said. \n\nBut you're REALLY an ass for minimizing what you did and dismissing him when he got angry about it. \n\nJust be a freaking adult and apologize, it's really not that hard.", "A very soft YTA, because you messed up with good intentions, but you still messed up. I would apologize to your brother, and then ask him if he would be willing to share your nieces hair care routine so you can still be involved with having \"girly\" time. I'm sure she will appreciate a female figure in her life who cares for her and loves her, so don't give up, just learn how to care for her differences.\n\nI'm a white woman, mother of three mixed children. Each and every one of them has a different hair care routine, because each one has significantly different hair. It's no joke. When I first started dating my husband, I wanted to save him some funds, so I offered to cut his hair (I did a lot of research on how to cut his hair, and how to style it, because I had only ever cut my siblings hair), but his mom said I couldn't, because i hadn't before, and wouldnt know how to handle his hair. So I went with him to his barber and watched intently how they cut hair. I'm now the only one who does my husband and our kids hair. But I have several different hair cutting kits, to accommodate all of our differences.\n\nYou messed up, but it's not relationship ending. Just show your brother that you really do care and want to be able to care for her hair too. You just need to learn how.\nBest of luck OP!", "YTA.

Niece wanted her hair like ours too. Niece has curly hair they\u2019re more loose curls but it\u2019s still curly. My brother always says not to touch niece\u2019s hair I thought he was just being dramatic. \n\nWell I started brushing it to put up and it got poofy fast. I didn\u2019t not what to do so I just left it. Well when my brother came to pick her up. He seen her hair and asked what happened I explained how niece wanted a high ponytail like us and I tried to put it up but that happened. My brother was visibly upset. He said this is why I didn\u2019t want you to ever do anything with her hair, you don\u2019t realize how hard it is to take care of curly hair. \n\nI thought he was just being over dramatic and told him he needs to chill out and it\u2019ll be okay.

My mother has board straight hair (she thinks her type 1b is frizzy, lol), and my father keeps his curls buzzed off so neither of them know how to handle curls.\n\nTreating curly hair like straight hair damages it, and it can be very painful on the scalp. When I was a child it would be HOURS of pain every single morning because my parents treated my hair like straight hair and instead of having me sleep in a protective style and wet comb it they let me sleep with it loose every night and would dry brush it when I woke up (anyone with curls and a sensitive scalp knows exactly what I am talking about here, ow!). I am intimately familiar with what this poor child is going to go through for the next several weeks while her dad repairs the damage.\n\nMy parents, at least, had the excuse that we lived in a very rural area where straight hair is the supermajority and there wasn't internet access until I was in my teens, so they didn't have access to the information. The approach was to treat my hair like it was wrong instead of considering that the approach to my hair is what was wrong. Which is what you did by giving up after you ruined her hair and ignoring your brother's advice not to mess with her hair.\n\nEven with the internet as an information source, not all curly hair is made equal: mine is very fine, but I have a high follicle density, a nonporous cuticle and its texture is about 2c/3a. The standard recommendations for curly hair will weigh mine down and leave it limp and greasy looking (but somehow *also* frizzy because _+&$ me) because it's extremely fine and also nonporous, but what works for straight hair leaves my hair super tangled and a frizz poof triangle that goes *out* more than *down*. It took me literal years of experiments to figure out something that kinda works, usually, if the weather is cooperating. But if I screw it up - like if I dry brush, dye or even blow dry on too high heat - I'm back to square 1 on figuring it out because any hair damage affects how my hair responds to product and how it looks. Curly hair is finicky, and when you've got a small child who will likely not have the patience to deal with the consequences of screwing up their hair, it's a nightmare if it's damaged. And unlike straight hair, dry brushing is one of the fastest ways to damage curly hair. So I am guessing what you did since you describe it becoming poofy is you dry brushed because that's how you pull straight hair into a ponytail. Unfortunately for the kid, that's *also* how you break and damage the shit out of curly hair.  \n\nHe warned you not to do anything with her hair. You ignored him. He will probably be working for literal weeks or months (I am not exaggerating, dry brushing is really that harmful to my hair at least) to undo what you did to her hair.

I think she didn't fully understand the situation & they are family, not just random \"white people\" so it would behoove dad to educate his sister since the children are bffs & liable to spend a lot of time around each other.

Going into who is discriminated against \"worst\" and only focusing on their issues is the wrong way to go, focus on discrimination as a whole. If we followed your approach we'd essentially be telling POC, women, and homosexual people they need to sit down until trans issues are addressed since some would say trans people experience the worst discrimination.  \n\n\nBTW I 100% agree OP is TA and that she shouldn't have touched her nieces hair since she didn't have experience with it.", ">The color of one\u2019s skin has 100% bearing on curly hair. \n\n\nThis is absolutely not true.
