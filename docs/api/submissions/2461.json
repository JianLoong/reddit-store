The girls have been wanting to do a spa day so we did a at home one last night. \n\nWell everything was going good my daughter and I both had are hair in high pony tails. Niece wanted her hair like ours too. Niece has curly hair they\u2019re more loose curls but it\u2019s still curly. My brother always says not to touch niece\u2019s hair I thought he was just being dramatic. \n\nWell I started brushing it to put up and it got poofy fast. I didn\u2019t not what to do so I just left it. Well when my brother came to pick her up. He seen her hair and asked what happened I explained how niece wanted a high ponytail like us and I tried to put it up but that happened. My brother was visibly upset. He said this is why I didn\u2019t want you to ever do anything with her hair, you don\u2019t realize how hard it is to take care of curly hair. \n\nI thought he was just being over dramatic and told him he needs to chill out and it\u2019ll be okay.

YTA.\n\nNever, ever, EVER brush dry curly hair. It causes the curls to break up and poof out into frizz, but worst of all, the curls also get extremely tangled, which can result in a lengthy and painful wash day. And if her hair is fine this may cause breakage. Textured haircare is no joke. You should've listened to your brother.", "YTA\n\nHe gave you a very specific instruction regarding the care of his child. You thought that you knew better and disregarded his instruction. How, on earth could you not be the A H here?", "YTA. When someone gives you instructions there's usually a reason why they have you those instructions. Especially when it's about their own children. Come on, you know you were the asshole here, don't you?", "YTA\n\nCurly hair is so difficult to deal with. I\u2019m white with curly hair and I only comb it on wash day. I do not brush my hair because my hair poofs. You can do a high pony tail with curly hair (practically every 80\u2019s movie proves this). You just needed to gather up her hair, not brush it.", "YTA.\n\nThere should be a way to compile every post here concerning curly hair because you need to do a deep dive into why this matters.", "YTA for touching her hair. Apologize and ask if it's ok for you to learn how to do her hair.  Please, always approach this gently and take \"no\" for an answer. Niece shouldn't feel excluded or othered for her hair/ being biracial. She just wants to be one of the girls. There's room for compromise here.  Educate yourself. There's tons of videos on YouTube from white moms showing their learning experiences with their kids textured hair.  Give it some time and approach this topic again with your brother, away from your niece. If he says it's ok, and she's OK with you learning with her, get some good product for her hair. Be patient, and take your cues from her.  It can be a great bonding experience or a childhood trauma for her.  That depends on you, her dad and her.", "YTA the father of the child told you in a very explicit way that you can't touch her hair. You have to apologize is really a big deal", "YTA - When you get explicit instructions from a parent about their child, you follow those instructions. It is really as simple as that. You don't get to just decide that another person is being \"dramatic\" and disregard what they say.\n\nTake responsibility for you actions, apologize to your brother, do better in the future.", "YTA. I suggest if you are going to have a spa day with your niece, you learn how to take care of her hair. Then run what you are considering doing by her dad before doing it.

The parent's \"no\" should have been all that you needed to follow. \n\nTwo, you do not know how to take care of curly hair, you may have damaged her hair by brushing it and not just 'made it poofy' \n\nYou should have said to her \"sorry sweetie, I don't have the stuff to he able to do your hair, we can talk to your dad and see about it\" and then you could educate yourself on how to do her hair by asking her dad about it, and then if he says it would be ok to educate yourself on how to do her hair, so when you watch her you can not fuck up again. If he says no you respect the no. If he says ok you make sure you dive deep into how to do and take care of curly hair before you touch her hair again.

You were specifically told never to brush it. You did what you wanted, and now the dad and the child are going to have to work to undo what you've done.

Get her to flip her head down and simply pull it all in a big loose high ponytail. What you did probably caused breakage and disrupted the curl pattern as well as being pretty painful for the child.

Your dismissiveness of her *father\u2019s* concerns and warnings about her hair is extremely disrespectful\u2014both to your brother, SIL, and your niece. Yes, afrotextured hair, curly hair, natural hair, mixed hair, etc IS A BIG DEAL. It can take a ton of careful maintenance and attention to make sure the hair is healthy and undamaged. You, ignorant, likely damaged your niece\u2019s hair and it most definitely hurt. \n\nMy hair is curly but not afrotextured and you do NOT take a dry brush to it\u2014it HURTS. The curls tangle with each other WHILE being brushed, and it\u2019s worse the tighter the curls are. My cousin is mixed and I\u2019d watch her white mother tear through her hair with a dry brush to force it into a \u201cneat\u201d high pony. My poor cousin would be in tears from pain because her mom never learned how to properly take care of black hair. My sister is also mixed, but our parents learned how to take care of her hair after years of trial and error with different hair care products. \n\nFurthermore, not only is there an active and physical part of taking care of natural hair, there\u2019s also a *huge cultural importance.* Hair is extremely important to the black community, especially to black women, as a form of history, culture, and self expression that is often policed, demeaned, diminished, and shamed by racism, societal bias, and nonblack people who refuse to learn. \n\nYour mentality that her hair is \u201cnot a big deal,\u201d makes you part of the problem in black hair not being taken seriously. And on top of that, your mentality is extremely problematic as you\u2019re downplaying the wishes of a parent towards their kid. If you don\u2019t apologize and learn from this, your brother and SIL aren\u2019t going to trust you with their kid. Is this the hill you want to die on? Do you want to strain or destroy your relationship with your niece because YOU personally don\u2019t think her hair is a big deal?

TBH if she needs a protective style now you should be the one paying for it.", "YTA. You didn't even bother to look at how to work with her hair. You messed it up and left it that way for her father to deal with. \n\nI'm white as can be but I have watched YouTube videos on working with textured hair. (I am amazed at how much WORK and TIME it takes to get a good hairstyle for these women.) 98% of Caucasian people don't know how to work with non-caucasian hair. \n\nCheck out Elite Hair Care USA on YouTube. You will see EXACTLY what it takes to work with textured hair.", "YTA. Sounds like I have the same background and hair as your niece. It hurts and causes frizz to brush it dry like that. It also causes long term damage and tangling because her hair is likely fine. You were given instructions not to mess with her hair. It is well known that black and textured hair often needs different care. Why would you ignore the instructions from her parent? You might not think hair is a big deal, but it is for many black/biracial people.", "YTA - Curly hair is an special kind of hair, my daughters hair is curly, i CANT, ME the father, i CANT comb her hair, i cant do a ponytail, because is different than straight hair. my wife hair ir curly and she is an \"expert\"!, the only thing i can do to her is the sleeping pony tail (bc it doesnt matter if its made correctly or not)", "NAH.  Lesson learned.  Next time you go up against curly hair, do a messy ponytail ie, no brush, no comb, minimal use of fingers, bobby pins or clips if necessary.  Siblings bicker, so if this is normal, fine otherwise maybe apologize and let him know you learned your lesson.", "YTA.  I really cringed when you not only messed up her hair but refused to apologize.", "You're an ass for going against what her dad said. \n\nBut you're REALLY an ass for minimizing what you did and dismissing him when he got angry about it. \n\nJust be a freaking adult and apologize, it's really not that hard.", "A very soft YTA, because you messed up with good intentions, but you still messed up. I would apologize to your brother, and then ask him if he would be willing to share your nieces hair care routine so you can still be involved with having \"girly\" time. I'm sure she will appreciate a female figure in her life who cares for her and loves her, so don't give up, just learn how to care for her differences.\n\nI'm a white woman, mother of three mixed children. Each and every one of them has a different hair care routine, because each one has significantly different hair. It's no joke. When I first started dating my husband, I wanted to save him some funds, so I offered to cut his hair (I did a lot of research on how to cut his hair, and how to style it, because I had only ever cut my siblings hair), but his mom said I couldn't, because i hadn't before, and wouldnt know how to handle his hair. So I went with him to his barber and watched intently how they cut hair. I'm now the only one who does my husband and our kids hair. But I have several different hair cutting kits, to accommodate all of our differences.\n\nYou messed up, but it's not relationship ending. Just show your brother that you really do care and want to be able to care for her hair too. You just need to learn how.\nBest of luck OP!", "YTA.

Niece wanted her hair like ours too. Niece has curly hair they\u2019re more loose curls but it\u2019s still curly. My brother always says not to touch niece\u2019s hair I thought he was just being dramatic. \n\nWell I started brushing it to put up and it got poofy fast. I didn\u2019t not what to do so I just left it. Well when my brother came to pick her up. He seen her hair and asked what happened I explained how niece wanted a high ponytail like us and I tried to put it up but that happened. My brother was visibly upset. He said this is why I didn\u2019t want you to ever do anything with her hair, you don\u2019t realize how hard it is to take care of curly hair. \n\nI thought he was just being over dramatic and told him he needs to chill out and it\u2019ll be okay.

I also didn't feed the kid any bacon, although he was begging me for it, I just calmly explained that my kids ate that, but he was Muslim, so not allowed to, so I made him something special just for him. It has everything to do with respect and nothing with skin color.", "Sorry but you\u2019re wrong here. My daughter has \u201cwhite\u201d curly hair and I have ethnically curly hair. If this woman had brushed out my daughter\u2019s curls, it would not have been ideal, but easily fixable with a little product, or wetting her hair, or she would have been able to braid it, or done about 100 other things to fix it. She couldn\u2019t fix it BECAUSE she has ethnically curly hair. Which is why she should never have touched it.", "It actually has everything to do with it. Curly white people's hair is not the same as curly non white people's hair. One difference is porosity.", "INFO: Then why didn\u2019t you follow his instructions about not touching his daughter\u2019s hair? Do you usually disregard his wishes as her parent?", "That really didn\u2019t answer their question.", "OP- listen you need to educate yourself 1st on hair and 2nd on how to be non-racist. I\u2019m sure other people can recommend books etc on the 2nd but I recommend watching the documentary called \u201cgood hair\u201d by Chris rock. It talks about African-American hair and how it is something to be valued (and it\u2019s really funny) \nAfter this beg your brother to let you watch and learn how he takes care of your nieces hair. So if one day you are allowed to keep her over you will know what to do. \nBut you messed up big time - apologize and learn from your mistakes", "I also have curly hair,  but l'm to lazy to take proper care of them. The longer it gets, the more curls they will give me. My hair is quite short now, so the curls are gone.", "Sometimes, even white people boggle at stick straight hair. I used to go to a teaching hair salon because it was dirt cheap and there was a teacher going around making sure the end result was presentable.\n\nOne time I got a student hairdressed who must never have worked on hair that didn't have at least *some* wave to it before, because they were so taken aback that they could see individual scissor marks in my hair (the teacher showed them how to blend it, it was fine.)", "Mine is both curly and tangly. Its a nightmare to deal with. I can\u2019t live without my special detangling conditioner", "Even ethnic curly hair is far different from white curly hair.", "I still cringe at the time in elementary school when I told a girl in my class with braids that she was gross for not washing her hair and just leaving it in the braids all week. As an adult I want to go back in time and smack myself in the mouth and explain why I was wrong.", "Assuming somebody has a certain personality trait based on the colour of their skin is racist", "[deleted]", ">No one is going around not hiring white people, touch their hair, asking if its real etc\u2026 because of their curly hair. That\u2019s not to say it has never happened, but it doesn\u2019t happen enough for it to cause country wide complaints.\n\nExactly. I'm a white woman with very curly hair (who spent most of my life not knowing what to do with it and trying to make it straighter because other white people around me were clueless about caring for it, lol) and I've never ever been at the receiving end of any kind of hair based discrimination. The way other white people view my hair just does not get filtered through a racist lens informed by centuries of eurocentric beauty standards the way it does for Black people, especially Black women.", "I agree with 98% of what you're saying...\n\nBut I'm also a white guy who had an Afro in highschool and was asked several times if people could touch it. So I'll have to disagree with that.", "As a very blonde person with very, very fine hair - I disagree. I often get asked about my hair - if it\u2019s real, what I\u2019ve done to get it so blonde (I grow it \ud83d\ude44) and people stating that I\u2019m blatantly lying because it can\u2019t be my real hair colour. \nPeople don\u2019t ask to touch it - they just do. Several times I have just felt a tug on my hair and it\u2019s been because someone has felt entitled to touch it because \u201cit looks so soft and shiny\u201d.  It\u2019s not even curly. People are inappropriate in general. Just stop touching other people without consent.", "No I know a lot of white people that have curly hair that is wrong to make it about race", "Bravo!", "Good news is, you know what you did when you were young and didn't know better is wrong and wouldn't do that now. Some people don't change or want to learn.", "When I was younger, I asked a girl I knew how what conditioner she used and how she got her hair so shiny. She had stunning hair and I have very brittle frizzy hair. She suddenly started insisting it was her own hair and not a weave. I wish I could go back and just not ask, I'm white and I had no idea! I was super jealous of her hair!", "Well, you were a child, so you get a pass. There are still grown ass adults who think like this and could use a couple smacks.", "That's a pretty far reach there bud.", "Not really. It's a widely known issue by educated people that POC men and women have had their hair treated unfairly in all situations vs white people; losing jobs or being sent home over hair being \"unkempt\" or \"not acceptable\" such as braids or durags and satin bonnets being considered trashy or ghetto, even when its similar to a white persons braid or bun in terms of hair protection.\n\nThen there's also lack of education on hair types outside of straight and fine vs minority hair types which leads to many white stylists not actually knowing how to work textured hair.\n\nIts a general rule, myself also as a white woman, that unless we have permission from someone else's parent that we don't know, and don't assume we know better than them about *their childs* hair esp. When told so specifically so.", "I don't know what gave you that impression. I have an issue with people assuming they can do whatever they want when there's a huge list of reasons not to, namely that the parent said don't.", "I\u2019ve never dealt with discrimination based on my hair, except maybe one time when a college career councilor told me that my hair was unprofessional and that I should either put it in a bun or straighten it for job interviews (it would take over 3 hours to straighten my hair with someone else helping me\u2026 no thanks!) \n\nBut I often get people touching it without asking, lots of: is that natural/real? Asking what I\u2019m mixed with (not am I mixed but what I\u2019m mixed with, which to my knowledge is nothing! My family is basically white wonderbread, but I ended up with really tight 3C type curls) it\u2019s\u2026 very very strange tbh.\n\nBut what I go through is obviously nothing compared to actual POC who want to wear their naturally.\n\nBut I definitely experienced the whole adults who don\u2019t know how to care for your hair phenomenon. But my mom started really devoting time and effort to learning more about it by the time I was in elementary. My hair didn\u2019t really get better until I was in charge of it and figuring it out myself but my mom was always supportive and tried her best.", "My sister has very very curly hair...she has gotten treatments to straighten it...spending so much money only for it to return to it's natural curl ... I love it! She does to but it's a lot of work...when she attempts to straighten it...it takes her 2 hours! She has a ton of hair! I had curly hair after my 1st pregnancy...then after my 2nd...my hair went straight again \ud83d\ude41...I would love to have my sister's hair! Who knows where she got that curly hair from...but it's beautiful \ud83d\udc95", "At least they asked.", "It's different. I also have very thick, very dense curly hair that poofs up when it's brushed out, but the amount of time/care I have to put into my hair is so very much less than a person of color. The texture is different, the moisture needs are different, etc.", "It\u2019s not the same thing, I might have thought something similar, I have thick curly hair, it was a pain to brush when I was young. One kid had very curly hair when she was young only want me or my mom to brush because we were careful, didn\u2019t pull her hair.\n\nMy nieces hair (her mom is white, dad Black) is also curly but the work that goes into her hair is so much more than I ever dealt with.\n\nEdited to correct spelling", "It's about texture.

And you don't know them, but still went on to assume they have an issue with white people.", "That doesn't even make sense. What are you talking about? You're 100% replicating the behavior that they were complaining about. A white person pretending they know more about their experience than they do.", "They were making a general observation. If it makes you feel bad, do something about racism, don't make it about you and your feelings. It is racist to not be interested in the needs your mixed-race niece.
