If it becomes a huge problem then make that little piece that holds water in the tub disappear.", "NTA.  Children learn bad habits when behavioral issues are not addressed before inappropriate habits are formed.  Mom is wrong.", "NTA, You can do whatever you like with your shampoo.", "NTA \n\nYou are entitled to keep your toiletries anywhere you want. \n\nI would be more concerned that your wife is overindulgent and allows her son to waste products and wants you to offer up yours too. It's disgusting to think about using bath products that are mixed with someone's dirty bath water.", "Or how about\u2026 Get him some tub toys and bubble bath.  Sounds like he\u2019s playing with the shampoo bottle. I wonder if this was your son how you would handle this parenting issue.  He\u2019s 10.  Guide him lovingly ffs.  Or ask your wife to guide him lovingly.  NAH", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to have shampoo and body wash to use. If your wife doesn't want to deal with her kid's behavior, you have to do something to make sure your stuff isn't wasted. \n\nYou might consider one of those dispensers that hangs on the wall and fill it with the cheapest stuff you can buy. I have boys that go through shampoo and body wash like crazy so that's what they get.", "NTA cause you will be standing in the shower with no product if you don\u2019t put it away - she can buy him his own and then there won\u2019t be a problem", "NTA. \nUnless your wife is preemptively purchasing products as a backup for you to use if/ when you discover your son has ruined yet another bottle of product, she needs to let this one go. Furthermore, the bigger issue needs to be addressed and resolved.  Your son is definitely old enough to learn.  Not allowing baths for a period of time when the issue occurs may be helpful. He definitely needs to understand how to respect others' belongings, and unlearn the entitlement he seems to have.", "Are you the Asshole to who? A 10 year old who is ruining your stuff?\n\nNTA I guess whether you are stopping a child or an adult from ruining your stuff.", "NTA but my brother does the same thing so maybe I\u2019m biased aha", "NAH. Here is 10. You should probably just be happy he is using cleaning products lol. \n\nWe just discovered our kid was wiping his hand on the soap once and then \"washing\". So disgusting and we've had to reteach what washing actually means lol.", "NTA. \n\nGive your stepson your wife's products when he heads to the bath, if it's no big deal she can just buy herself another container of whatever he wastes.", "NTA - My kids love doing this, however they definitely understand most items are unavailable to them.\n\nI tend to buy a handful of cheap bath products for them to waste. Smaller bottles are better than big containers. I also keep extra bottles in the tub for \u201cpotion making\u201d. \n\nThe extra bottles end up saving a lot of product because instead of dumping product in the tub they experiment in the bottles. \n\nWith appropriate options the kids don\u2019t mess with anything outside of the tub. It\u2019s still best to remove special products from the shower area because they can easily end up waterlogged if they accidentally fall into tub. \n\nDisapproving of your choice to keep your bath products safe from destruction seems strange. It doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to prefer constant replacement. Would that mean you\u2019d always need backups of your products in some safe space like your bedroom? You\u2019d only know you need a replacement upon attempting use, it\u2019d be pretty inconvenient not having backups.", "NTA He\u2019s not respecting other people\u2019s possessions and wife is enabling that attitude.", "NTA hes been talked to about it and seeks out your stuff to waste.

He obviously prefers a bath to the shower and it's doesn't have to be expensive getting him his own toiletries. Give him a shelf with his stuff on it, explain that it will be replaced regularly but only on your shopping days, if it's all gone before then he will have to do without until the next shopping trip.", "Nta- I understand your frustration,  and i don't think your an asshole. But, 10 year olds do dumb shit. And the fact he is a stepson, I think its worth losing a few bottles of soap to keep him thinking your a dad figure and not just the cranky dude that married his mom. Maybe try taking him to the store and let him pick out his own soap?", "NTA.

Your stepson actually should have faced some consequences like paying for it out of his pocket money when he grabbed it even when you had put it away.

He has his own toothpaste and his own dollar store body wash.

Wet it and put a squirt of showergel on it and it foams up really well and rinses well. Hang up to dry. They last a really long time if hung on a hug over the bath or shower to dry.
