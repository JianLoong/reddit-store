Seems pretty straightforward to me. Sell the stuff\\*, declutter. You don't need it.

They'll need it more than anyone else possibly could.", "INFO \n\n> she would ask me for pregnancy advice and I wouldn\u2019t tell her what she wanted to hear\n\nElaborate. Sounds important. \n\n> the only time she talks to me is when I tell her I have clothes\n\nWhen else did you contact her and how does that go?", "NTA. Quietly sell or donate. Unless you enjoy more of your sister's drama, there's no reason to mention any of this to your mom or anyone else. You didn't ask, but if I were in your position I would not waste my time or energy reading your sister's sm.", "NTA. Sell 'em.", "NTA she sounds like she\u2019s just mooching and trying to take advantage of an opportunity for free baby clothes without any effort to have a good relationship with you because \u201cblood is thicker than water\u201d. I think that\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m a firm believer \u201cin treat others how they treat you\u201d. If she barely talks to you, is annoying, and alludes to cutting you off then don\u2019t give her anything.", "NTA, if you do not have a relationship with your sister it doesn\u2019t make sense to take the extra time and effort it takes to give her the clothes. If you\u2019re \u201ccut\u201d off it means you\u2019re not communicating. I wouldn\u2019t go the extra mile for someone that only wants to use me.", "NTA she doesn't seem like someone worth your time or thought.", "NTA.  She's only in contact when she wants something. Then she'll discard it if she doesn't like it, like your answers to her questions. So, you give her the clothes, she doesn't like them, she tosses them. Or worse, she sells them and keeps the money.\n\nYou owe her nothing. Sell the clothes.", "NTA \n\nIf there is something she or your bio-mom gave you, it might be a kind-hearted gesture to hold onto those items. Mail them to her if you wish. \n\nOtherwise? Sell or donate as you see fit.", "NTA.  -sell away, she doesn't make an effort, why ever should you? \n\nBut what mom? Your other bio-mom, or do you have others?", "nta", "NTA. Times are tough, can use all the money you can get. No shame in that!", "Sell them. Save a few things for her but sell the rest. \n\nYour sister sounds nuts. This whole wanting to cut off family to focus on her own little family is nuts. \n\nA relationship with your sister should not be predicated upon what you give her. That is a transaction - not a relationship. When she raises a stink about you selling the clothes, tell her that you'd love to have a relationship with her but you refuse to be used. When she shows you she is interested in a relationship with you and your girls then you will happily consider passing down the clothes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And NTA, OP.", "She had a very complicated pregnancy, like she would bleed a lot and would freak out and ask me if I had bleeding which I did and when I told her I did she would tell me I was wrong.. she also would ask me if I thought having a midwife would be appropriate for her and I told her that a midwife wasn\u2019t capable of handling high risk pregnancies and she would tell me I\u2019m wrong. Just things like that. \nAnd I\u2019ve tried to contact her about like a cute little sign I had for my daughters room that I just have no use for to see if she wanted it and she called my mom an hour after I sent the message and didn\u2019t get back with me until 5 or 6 hours later. Also I\u2019ve asked her if she was coming up here sometime soon to make plans and I would never get a response", "Glad you asked these questions.

I was running on the assumption that her choices were 'give them away to her entitled ungrateful sister' or 'sell them to clear out the clutter'.", "She would basically ask my opinions on things and then tell me I\u2019m wrong. For instance she had a lot of bleeding and I had some and asked me if I had had bleeding and I would tell her yes and she would say \u201cwell, no you didn\u2019t\u201d or \u201cnot as much as me\u201d", "Sorry.
