They apparently had a hard enough problem just dealing with him being Autistic ..Problem is my family is very huggy and touchy its kinda like our love language so it was hard for me when I had to wait for him to get comfortable enough  with me that I can hold him,hugg him etc. Even still I usually ask him first just in case. \n\nEven though we've been together for about a year and some months he hasn't really met my family yet because we live across the country at school. I  brought him home with me for a family reunion last weekend and I explained to my parents and my siblings in the vaugest way that he doesn't like physical touch to much  because he doesn't like people knowing about his time on the street.  Apparently my mom saw me give him hug when we got to my parents house  Friday and assumed I was overexaggerating and when we got to the door she just opened the door and grabbed us up in one of her big bear hugs..\n\nCasey of course freaked the f**ck out and had a panic attack .

Everything was fine until  Sunday  when my dad and Casey got to talking and and my dad absent mindedly said something about his parents missing out on such a sweet boy. Casey panicked and just got up and ran off. It took me like 2 hours to find him and he was mad and yelled at me that I had no right to say anything to my parents. I tried to apologize and I told him I only sad anything so they'd back off.

But you should realize that relationships don't have to be this hard, especially at 19. Sometimes people need to get their own mental house in order before pairing up.", "I don't think anyone is so out of line to be considered an AH, so I will go with NAH (tentatively E S H). You know you broke his trust by telling your parents when he was not ready to reveal his trauma. However he does not seem to be considerate of you or your family's feelings here, likely out of self-preservation. You have to walk on eggshells to keep him from panicking given the difference in showing affection, and to make sure your parents understand that he is not coming from a place of rudeness when he refuses hugs. This is incredibly hard to do flawlessly, as a 19 year old. It is no wonder you made a mistake in telling your family. In addition, your boyfriend has had years of trauma, starting from age 13, and he is now only 19, suggesting he has had a very short time to process these feelings. Therefore it is no wonder he is this upset at you telling your parents before he could decide when to tell them.   \n\n\nI think the most important takeaway here is that he was not equipped to meet your parents. If even a well-meaning hug from his S.O's parent sends him into a panic attack, he is clearly not in a stable place to have regular interactions with your family, and needs to keep working on his coping strategies. Your family should have been given more than a vague description that he does not like physical touch, to avoid misunderstandings like this. And lastly you need to consider that it may take a long time for you to earn back his trust after this. Good luck.", "YTA. You could have said he had a strong aversion to being touched *without* revealing that his parents threw him out when he was 13. That wasn't your story to share.\n\nYour mother is also an AH for deciding that \"don't hug Casey\" was a suggestion that she could ignore.", "Casey needs therapy, not a relationship.  NTA for now.", "NAH. However as someone who doesn\u2019t hug strangers and am not considered a \u201cfriendly\u201d person in regards to touch, my friend told her family \u201cShe doesn\u2019t hug, it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t like you, just don\u2019t hug her.\u201d And they did not even try. We did become close and I am actually married into that family now.   \n\n\nYou told your hugging tribe your partner wasn\u2019t keen on hugging in vague terms and your mother bear hugged him. As for Casey not wanting people to know he was homeless, that is also valid. And yet you told your family. \n\nCasey probably needs a bit more therapy and you might not be the right partner for him. Casey can be upset about this. You don\u2019t sound sorry at all. However,  Casey running off for 2 hours is not right either.", "NTA but expect your parents to use this every single time there's a wrinkle in life.", "NAH.  Your bf clearly is going through a lot, but you and your family have good intentions. You're very young to be dealing with this level of intensity. When I was 17-18 I was with a guy with a similar backstory and mental issues, those relationships can become very codependent and toxic quickly. I think you need to ask yourself if you really want to be dealing with this at your age. This is the age relationships should be fun and easy. And your bf clearly needs time to process and heal from his tramuas.", "Sorry, this is a difficult situation to navigate especially at a young age. But YTA. \n\nWe all have or will at times unintentionally hurt a partner by saying the wrong thing with the best intentions. Ask for forgiveness and forgive yourself too. Mistakes happen. \n\nPlease be patient with him.", "YTA\n\nYou betrayed his trust to make your parents feel better. They didn\u2019t need an explanation, they just needed to understand that no means no. Your family has issues with respecting boundaries. I\u2019m including you in that.", "Oof, the softest of YTA - you clearly meant well and it was an honest mistake, but it really wasn't your information to share without permission. Hopefully he will calm down and realize you weren't trying to betray him, you were trying to protect him and now that you know just how serious of a line that is for him, there's no way you'd cross it again. Give him time. I hope it works out for you, you seem to really love him!!", "YTA. Couldn\u2019t you have explained the situation to your parents based on his Autism? If you know that he doesn\u2019t like people to know about his history, then you did break his trust. Hopefully you can apologize again and talk about how he would like you to handle situations like this in the future.", "NAH.  You should have discussed this with your boyfriend before disclosing specifics to your parents, but your heart was in the right place.  Your mom is a bit of a jerk for assuming that your boyfriend would be fine with hugging her just because he was willing to hug his own boyfriend.", "1. Why is survived put in quotations? He got kicked out and was on the streets that is surviving. And 2. YTA and so is your mother she should\u2019ve just respected the fact that you said he doesn\u2019t like touch regardless of his Autism if someone doesn\u2019t wanna be touched you don\u2019t touch them. And you should have NEVER went into so much detail about why he has panic attacks that\u2019s personal shit that if he wanted your family to know he would tell them but he just met them and your mom broke his trust right away so yea I wouldn\u2019t want her knowing that type of personal information.", "NAH I can understand why he is upset that you disclosed personal information without his consent, but also I think your heart was in the right place, and you wanted them to be able to really understand and support both him and you. Hopefully you can navigate this differently in the future by discussing with him first the things you want to disclose and why. But also it sounds like you're in over your head a little bit with this relationship and needing your family's support, so I don't blame you for getting it.", "ESH\n\nYour mother, for not respecting your boyfriend's boundaries when you had clearly communicated them.\n\nYou. You shouldn't have revealed personal information about him, that was a rule before his panic attack and it still is after. His panic attack doesn't make it okay to betray his trust.\n\nYour dad. It could have ended there, but it didn't. He was also weird talking about your boyfriend's parents who left him homeless.\n\nAutism. Autism sucks too.", ">Casey panicked and just got up and ran off.

NTA", "ESH You need to discuss with your partner on what they are comfortable disclosing, your parents didn't care about the boundaries, and your partner isn't being a very fair partner. \n\nYou clearly had to go behind his back to tell your parents without discussing it with him, the vibe from this post suggests you knew he would have an adverse reaction. How has he treated you in the past to make you huddle in a corner while he's asleep to \"give a heads up\" to someone??? Is this a common occurrence????\n\nYou're 19. Like another commenter has said, relationships don't have to be this hard. \n\nI'm almost tempted to say NTA because you genuinely tried really hard while treading on eggshells.", "I\u2019m gonna just say I\u2019m not qualified to judge this.. my mind can\u2019t even comprehend the amount of fuckery in this post. I think I want to say everybody sucks here.. like everybody. Your family, you, your bf\u2019s family, and your bf (very mildly). You all suck.", "NTA. This is a good example of the kind of struggles we have when a loved one is on the spectrum. \n\nIt is reasonable for Casey not to want to be touched and also reasonable for him to feel betrayed by you sharing information about him that he wanted kept private.\n\nBut it won't feel reasonable to you or your parents, and that causes pain for all involved. Be patient, be loving, and keep in mind that every interaction he experiences is influenced by a social disability that he has very little control over. \n\nI recommend that Casey connect with other autistic adults to learn how to better manage encounters with the neurotypical people in his life.", "NTA. Dump him. He\u2019s damaged right now. You can\u2019t love someone who\u2019s trying to figure out how to love themselves. He may never figure it out. Are you gonna spend your life isolated from family, apologizing because he can\u2019t handle even sympathetic situations?", "ESH.  You could have been clear with your parents without revealing anything: \"he doesn't like to be touched by people he doesn't know.  Please do not hug him or touch him without verbal consent from him beforehand. I mean it.\"\n\nYour mom for ignoring your vague warning.\n\nI would say, \"your dad for bringing it up,\" except if you didn't tell him not to let on that he knew anything, then that's you, again.\n\nVery very mild on your BF, who should be getting counseling for PTSD from living on the streets, especially if it's so bad that he runs off and you have to hunt him down; if you're in school, the school probably has counselors available.  But he deserves to not have his boundaries violated, whether or not he's getting help.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA. \n\nYes, technically you did break his trust but telling you family a bit about his past to explain an extremely uncomfortable situation for all parties involved. However, it wasn\u2019t something done with malice. You were sharing some of YOUR mental load with your personal and (presumably) trusted support system. It is perfectly reasonable for your family to have some knowledge of your partners background. \n\nIt appears based on the post you are a very supportive partner and take on a lot by being with someone who is dealing with the kinds of trauma they went through, but you also need your own support. Based on the extreme behaviors your bf displayed, I find it unlikely he provides up an equal level of support in return for the emotional baggage he brings into the relationship. You have to be able to unload the mental weight you carry in healthy ways just as much as he does. \n\nYou mom was wrong is hugging your bf, but, again, it wasn\u2019t done in malice, just ignorance. As long as she apologized and doesn\u2019t repeat the bad behavior, she is not an AH either. \n\nIn my opinion, Your dad wasn\u2019t out of line with his comment, he was just trying to say something positive but unfortunately it ended up being a triggering topic.\n\nYour bf, if anyone, would be the AH. I say this only because I\u2019m under the assumption he is not actively in any sort of treatment or therapy for his issues since it was never mentioned in your post that he was working on any sort of healthy coping mechanisms and dealing with his traumas. If he has a proclivity of full blown mental break downs at the slightest trigger and he is not actively putting the work in to do better, that is not someone I would recommend being involved with.", "YTA why did you think that you can share such personal/sensitive information without permission?\n\nIt\u2019s not your place to share such information about your bf to people he doesn\u2019t know. I can understand why your bf doesn\u2019t want that type of information out because now he is seen as a victim, a poor sweet boy who was abandoned by his parents. Which your parents already see him as because your dad said so. \n\nYour bf wants to be seen and treated as a normally as possible. He doesn\u2019t want to be seen as the person who can\u2019t hug due to trauma. \n\nYou should have said to your mom why did she ignore the warning about no hugging your bf? Just because you see something doesn\u2019t mean that it applies to you. That you made it clear to them about this issue and that she caused harm (panic attack) because she thought she doesn\u2019t apply to the No hugging rule when it was clear that it dod applied to her. \n\nAlso you broke his trust big time. He opened himself up and trusted you to share his experience/history. He shared this information so that you can understand why the way he is so that you don\u2019t think that his aversions are linked to you in any way. He trusted you to keep and protect that information to yourself. Ad you broke that trust by sharing to with strangers (your parents) - people he doesn\u2019t not know or trust because if he did he would have told them him selves or asked you to tell them but again that is HIS CHOICE and NOT YOURS to make. \n\nExpect your bf to be less likely to share sensitive personal history, experiences, and information anymore or any time soon. There is a possibility that this could end your relationship because your broke his trust and confidence big time. It would have been an immediate deal breaker for me big time.", "nta i dont think you did anything wrong. some people would be ok with you explaining that for them, but maybe he feels too exposed? it seems like he takes a while to trust people, and maybe having something personal about him told without his knowledge scared him. especially if hes had people do that with malicious intent.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou and your AH family hurt your bf. If you don'T do better, you will be single soon. HE will NEED to drop you to protect himself.", "YTA, trying to do good but still an AH. Your parents didn't need to know details, they just need to know that physical contact is something they should never do unless he allows it first. There doesn't even need to be an explanation. Just a \"He hates physical contact with other people\" should be more than enough.\n\nYour mom is also an AH for ignoring the previous explanation, she could use common sense that your boyfriend is ok with hugging you (aka his partner) sometimes, but not a complete stranger (aka your mom)", "Soft YTA. It wasn't your place to tell Casey's story. Your mom is also the A H for giving him after being told not to. However, you're also very young and likely needed to learn this lesson. In the future, consider how others might feel if you share their personal stories with others, especially strangers. Casey sounds like a pretty private person, and after what he's been through, he's likely very guarded. Let him have that, he's earned it.", "YTA\n\nYour mom saw someone he trusted hugging him.  She decided that as a stranger, it was also okay to do the same.  You decided to violate his trust to make them feel better.  What you could have said to your parents that he doesn't like strangers touching him without his permission.  That could have been the end of the reasoning to them.  \n\nYou showed him that you are willing to violate his trust and boundaries for other people.  You robbed him of the ability to choose who he lets his story be known by.", "YTA\n\nSo, if I understand correctly, you, without permission, told your parents that your partner had been sexually exploited as a child. \n\nThat is a huge betrayal of trust, and incredibly sensitive information to reveal. And you told them so quickly. And it didn't need to be revealed. Your parents didn't need that level of detail. And then they couldn't even keep it to themselves. \n\nYou have to see why he would no longer trust you.", "YTA, sorry. Not your story to tell.", "Soft YTA simply because there are plenty of ways to explain to your seemingly understanding parents why a bf wants to not be touched. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive topic I don\u2019t think he\u2019d want me to get into but if you could please hold off on hugs or anything that will be best.\u201d", "YTA in the story, but the fact that you are capable of loving a person with such difficulties in life counterbalances it and makes you NTA in general.", "soft yta. The only thing your parents need to understand is that they don't get to touch strangers without getting their consent first. And also you were super stressed out and trying to help. So you did fuck up, but you intentions were good. Hopefully casey comes around and y'all can find a better way to navigate this stuff", "YTA because that wasn't your info to share. But also as some personal advice it's okay for this relationship you two have to not work out. To put it mildly he isn't at a point in his life where you two can be happy together yet. He's extremely sensitive to touch (not just from PTSD btw, touch sensitivity is a normal spectrum thing) and touch is how you feel loved. That's a huge DAILY incompatibility. I am also a touch driven person in a house of people with touch sensitivities and it's so miserable. I never get to be happy because I'm always tiptoing around other people's triggers to make sure *they're* happy. I can't even hug my own daughter normally! Hug her with an angled fist so the fingers don't accidentally tickle, and don't hug too soft or too hard or too long, and only when she's wearing certain shirts and etc etc. It never ends.\n\nAka this relationship is a hell of a lot of work and you might be too young to realize that love doesn't always make it worth it. There are plenty of loving, wonderful relationships that aren't even half this amount of work. So accidentally YTA but also maybe find someone you're more compatible with? Don't stay in a relationship to \"fix\" or out of pity for someone?", "YTA. \u201cHey family, my partner is NOT a hugger. Don\u2019t hug them.

If someone wants me to know and remember, they need to really spell it out how bad it is to forget.", "\"He doesn't like physical touch.\"\n\nIf he said that, that should be enough. It is definitely enough to know not to bear hug him.", "That wasn't me, fyi. And \"don't tell anyone my backstory\" is a pretty gd clear boundary.", "You keep modifying \u201cboundary\u201d with words like \u201chard\u201d or \u201chardcore.\u201d That is unnecessary.  When you tell someone the ways in which you do not wish to be treated \u2014 or convey that message for someone else \u2014 that is enough. I don\u2019t know how much more \u201cforceful\u201d you can get than looking your mother and father directly in the eye and saying \u201cDo not touch him. Touching is off limits. This is not a joke. *Do you understand what I\u2019ve just said to you?*\u201d\n\nAgain, a boundary is not any less \u201chard\u201d if it is devoid of explanation. And again, if they cross that boundary, ***that is on them***. Telling them his intensely personal business without his express say-so is made all the more offensive by the fact that *it\u2019s entirely unnecessary*. \n\nIf any person in your life requires a full and complete understanding of *why* you\u2019ve stated your boundaries, and will not abide by them unless you do, that is not a trustworthy person."]}
