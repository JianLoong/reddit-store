Not sure if it matters, but we have been together almost 6 years and living together for 4 years. We have a 2 bedroom apartment, and in the spare bedroom we have 2 twin XL size beds for my nieces who spend the night at our apartment frequently. His parents have visited us before but never stayed the night, and they know we have 2 twin beds in the spare room. When it came time for bed I gave them extra pillows and blankets and directed them to the extra bedroom. They had assumed they would get mine and my boyfriend's master bedroom. His parents are somewhat conservative, and while they have no problems with me and my boyfriend living together unmarried, they said that the married couple in the house should share the larger bed together and we were insulting their marriage by suggesting they sleep in separate beds. I told them that this is mine and my boyfriend's apartment, and we will sleep in our bedroom. My boyfriend agreed with me and took my side, and when he took my side it started a big argument. I eventually told them they can sleep in the guest room or leave. They decided to leave and get a hotel because they were too tired to make the 2 hr drive home. Today they texted both me and my boyfriend demanding we reimburse them for their hotel, and I told them they were crazy if they thought I was reimbursing them for the hotel.

They were guests. That's how this works. Perhaps get them a dictionary?", "NTA. Guests sleeping in the guest room isn't commentary on their marriage. And you don't owe them for a hotel room THEY CHOSE to sleep in.", "NTA.\n\nI'm guessing they DO have problems with the two of you living together unmarried, or they wouldn't have pulled that stunt.   They've just been concealing their attitude--but their problem is their own.\n\nYou offered them perfectly suitable accommodations, the fact that they chose not to accept them is also a \"them\" problem, and any costs they incurred as a result are their responsibility.", "NTA\n\nyour house, your decisions. they decided to get a hotel instead of sucking it up for one night, that\u2019s on them and not you. \n\ncouldn\u2019t they have just pushed the two beds together to make it into one?", "NTA in any way, shape or form. Your in laws seem extremely entitled.", "NTA. Entitlement is wiiiiiiiild. I want to laugh about how entitled some people are, but sometimes it\u2019s so dumbfounding that it\u2019s almost scary to consider sharing a planet with people who are that delusional. I would never visit somebody else\u2019s home and demand their bed. You did nothing wrong, and under no circumstances should they reimbursed for their ridiculous tantrum.", "NTA - wow, what an insanely ungrateful response. Additionally, theyd rather sleep in the bed you and your boyfriend share than the guest room? Wtf.", "NTA but did you think to put the beds together and fit with double sheets/blankets? I've been in hotels where that was done. And no, the hotel was their choice. Not your bill.", "NTA. Not everyone has a guest space at all. You don't owe it to guests to uproot yourselves for their preference (nor for their need, but that definitely wasn't a need), and you certainly don't owe them cash for their choice not to avail themselves of your hospitality.", "NTA. Its your home. You offered them perfectly appropriate sleeping arrangements and they chose to have a hissy fit and leave .\n\nEven if they had assumed that you've give up your bed (which is a pretty big assumption), that's a minor irritation, and they then remember for another time and make plans accordingly. \n\nAnd you didn't 'insult their marriage' - this had nothing to do with their marriage and everything to do with the available bedrooms.  They are being ridiculous.", "NTA. This was a weird ass flex they expected the best room and more importantly to displace you two from your room. It doesn't matter if you have a nicer bed or not, they'd find a reason to try to force you to take the second bedroom. The twin beds were an easy excuse to push their agenda to shuffle you to the secondary space. Its a power play.", "NTA you should have asked them if they really wanted to sleep where y'all have sex every night I bet that would have shut them up", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. Sound like difficult guests. I'm glad your boyfriend stood up for you. You don't owe them anything either. They made that choice.", "NTA\n\nThey are crazy to think they can give demands about where you sleep in your own home. Also it's on them that they went to a hotel, it's not on you to pay for it.", "NTA! You have a perfect right to sleep in your bed in your own home. You had a guest room and it had beds for both of them. They made a big fuss over something that was not in their wheelhouse.", "NTA. My house my rules.", "NTA and yes, they're crazy if they expect you to reimburse them for their massive entitlement.\r  \n\r  \nI trust that you two have no intention of ever allowing them to stay at your place in the future.", "Nta\n\nYou offered a place to sleep, they did reject , and then argue and wanting money. Sorry it's a little bit hilarious.\n\nYou 2 did the right thing.\n\nIf they don't want, then it's not your fault.\n\nSometimes we have to appreciate, what is offered. Or go and take a hotel room.", "NTA. Holy entitlement! They truly have balls of brass.", "NTA. Anyone who expects a couple to give up their bedroom and move to a guest room is a bad houseguest.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve a hard time even believing this would be such an issue! Don\u2019t you dare reimburse them, nor apologize. Being somehow shamed because you don\u2019t have their ideal suite all set yup for them is ridiculous!", "NTA they sound like terrible guests. It\u2019s not like you asked them to sleep on the couch, you gave them their own bedroom with perfectly functioning beds for them to sleep on", "NTA Guests don\u2019t get to decide sleeping arrangements in the Host\u2019s home.", "NTA,\n\nGuests sleep in the guest room. Easy. \n\nThey aren\u2019t your in laws though\u2026..lol smh", "NAH  but discussing this before they arrived would have been a good idea.

This is ridiculous that in your apartment they think they can dictate what happens or that they are entitled to your bedroom! Pay them for the hotel? You offered somewhere they made their choice.
