I personally think it\u2019s gross when I read these stories. Like\u2026 obviously you guys get frisky in your own bed/bedroom. Have personal items in your own bedroom.

NTA.", "Who would want to kick someone out of their bed? It\u2019s just weird.", "NTA. This is so weird! You have many personal things in a bedroom.

Your house, they are the guests. Why would they expect to have your bed in your room? Being married does not give them rights to the bed or anything else in your house. \n\nAnd good for BF for backing you up and showing his parents what a guest is.", "NTA \u2014 and wanting to sleep in the bed where your son sleeps and has sex with his partner instead of a perfectly good private guest room is weird.", "Nta but next time push the twin beds together. That way they can say they got the biggest bed. Two twins makes a king. Since you have XL twin beds I believe that makes a California king size bed so that should be even better.", "NTA.

Laugh at their entitlement", "NTA\n\nThey wanted to sleep in the bed you have sex in regularly? It\u2019s unlikely the sheets were freshly washed.

But it would be great to get king sized sheets to have on hand so you can push the beds together when hosting couples in the future (2 twins = 1 standard king).

We\u2019re all in our 30s and mostly married/ long term couples. We decided to have a slumber party and sleep in the kids room. All of us in twin beds. It was silly and fun. His mom thought it was hilarious, but she was slightly exasperated until she figured out we were actually serious about it when everyone was finally in bed around 2 am. \n\nWe did wash all the sheet and didn\u2019t make any extra work for her or anything, but I thought it was funny how shocked she was that we really slept in there.

I dunno how big y\u2019all are on textures, but I have the soft fluffy comforter because I love those textures when I\u2019m sleeping. My fianc\u00e9 has the normal comforter.

Added to my packing list for my fall trip."]}
