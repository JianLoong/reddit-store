It was harsh, but maybe MIL will think next time she decides to get cavalier and bulldoze everyone because she thinks she knows better.", "You won't get nuance on here, I swear most people on here don't have any real life relationships, and they seem to think that whenever someone is wronged that going nuclear is the only/best option.", "She didn\u2019t get a good outcome because MIL made that impossible. You think she should be allowed to treat her clearly injured and disabled son that way and still be treated with respect?", "How was this not a good outcome? She *had* to make MIL leave because MIL was essentially torturing her husband. MIL is likely to want a relationship with OP & husband, so MIL will probably reach out and apologize and they can resume the relationship.\n\nAlso, you don't marry the whole family - that's just a trope some people believe. Many people believe and feel differently.", "My point is MIL won\u2019t think bc all she sees is being insulted. If OP had laid some of the real issues out maybe MIL would think or others would chime in that what OP said was fair but instead OP looks mean and MIL ain\u2019t gonna change a bit.", "Where did I say she should be allowed to mistreat her injured son? As I\u2019ve said in other comments OP should have put her foot down but she should have said \u201cwe are following the doctors orders and if you can\u2019t you have to leave\u201d but what she did was just cruelly insult MIL. That will have lasting effects on all of their relationships and has added stress to an already stressful situation. I get OP\u2019s anger but she let feelings take over, when she did have facts on her side and it wasn\u2019t necessary. Everything isn\u2019t so extreme and with family you do have to use some diplomacy.", "Considering MIL is on a campaign to get the rest of the family on her side I doubt she\u2019ll be the one to apologize. And if your partner has a close relationship with their family you are married to them as well. Because you will be around them all the time. It\u2019s not about what an individual believes, it\u2019s about the reality.", ">Where did I say she should be allowed to mistreat her injured son?\n\nI asked why she should be allowed to mistreat her injured son and still be treated with respect. I didn\u2019t accuse you of anything, I\u2019m just saying why show politeness when someone is perfectly content treating others with anything but.\n\nIf MIL can\u2019t take cruelty, maybe she shouldn\u2019t dish it out either.\n\nOP is rightfully angry because her MIL is treating her husband like shit."]}
