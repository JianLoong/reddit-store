{"id": 9661, "submission_id": "10z1vdp", "title": "AITA for asking the front desk of my college to give me my Uber Eats order?", "selftext": "Obligatied this happened last night right before midnight. I'm 19F.\n\nI instructed my driver to leave my order outside of the dorm building on the wall by the entrance doors. It was less than a minute when she finished delivering it and to the point I was down on the first floor outside looking for my order. \n\nIt was gone because in under a minute the desk clerks immediately hopped up from their desk, grabbed it, and set it behind their counter. And keep in mind, their desk is actually pretty good walk from the doors. There wasn't another sole in site and I knew nobody else would've taken it besides the desk, so I walked my way over and I saw my order on their side of the counter.\n\nI walked over very politely, smiling, and I was like, \"oh that's mine!! :)\" (my voice is naturally really soft, shy, & quiet so i know I wasn't being loud or demeaning to these workers.) and they stared at me and asked for some sort of *confirmation* that it was mine. I handed them my student ID and said it should probably be the same name as the receipt and she seemed to get angry and asked for a little more than that.\n\nI was like, \"oh yeah okay sorry! i'll go on the app.\" i proceeded to go on the uber eats app and i showed them the receipt/where it says \"Ordered Delivered! : Name dropp,d it off at this location\" with the photo, date & time, and order number\"\n\nThey stared at each other making these weird faces and asked me for some type of confirmation code that it was mine and i looked more at the app and all I could show them was what I already did.\n\n\"i'm sorry there's nothing else I can really show y'all!! i gave my id, receipt, order number, photo, and everything.\" they make wide eyes to each other and just holding my bag in their hands. still as soft and quiet as ever, and I'm even trying to laugh at thus point, I said \"can i have my food please? im sorry i showed you it was mine, thanks!!\"\n\nas SOON as I said that their faces dropped with the BIGGEST widest eyes and mouths I've ever seen completely staring at each other shocked and staring at me and one of the girls yelled to the other \"YOOOO WHY DOES SHE HAVE SUCH AN ATTITUDE?!?!?!? YOOOO\" \n\nand now I'm shocked and I tell them \"excuse me? i asked for my food politely because i showed you every confirmation it was mine and it's late. i'm not having an attitude ive been nothing but kind and compliant with what you asked for.\" and they just keep staring at each other and me shocked and they slowly hand me my food and immediately switch up and say \"okay well YOU have a goodnight.\" like the fake sarcastic tone yknow.\n\nI never left though. I walked away from the desk but I stayed in the hall and I didn't go to my room. I hear them start SCREAMING again \"YOOO THAT WHITE GIRL HAD SUCH AN ATTITUDE AAAHHHHAAAAAA\" crying laughing and being mad. \n\nI didn't say anything and I left it with them at that.\n\nEDIT 1:\nThank you all!! I messaged my RA about the incident and she said she reported it to the ACD but i have no idea if anything would be done with this. should i go to the hall director himself in his office? \n\nEDIT 2:\n\n I'm not going to type out something fake, I'm telling it how it is. As I walked back I could hear it going up the elevator just them insulting me, screaming, and laughing. The girls said YOOOOO so loud that it hurt my ears and made me shocked. if it was an offhand quiet comment to the other girl I probably would've let it slide because if they want to gossip like that in front of me, then go ahead but it was loud. it was verbal. it was screaming. it was insulting.\n\nthis post has nothing to do with race. i love this college and its one of the most diverse in texas, if I had a problem with it, I wouldn't be here.\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nI didn't see them working tonight but I could be mistaken. I'm going to wait it out and see if anyone contacts me back wanting to know more, and if not, then I'm going to the head hall director himself on Monday. He lives in our building fortunately and I've spoken to him before and he's so nice so I don't think we'll have any issue there. My parents are driving up here tomorrow but I have no idea if is should tell them or not. my mom would go absolutely nuts on the workers. :)\n\n\nI ordered a small tot from sonic and had it delivered since I had some uber eats cash and I tested out getting it handed to me. it worked though I got my HOT food and it was worth the eight bucks I spent.", "created_utc": 1676060299, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z1vdp/aita_for_asking_the_front_desk_of_my_college_to/", "score": 250, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
