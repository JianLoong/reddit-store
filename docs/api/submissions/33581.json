Get him to a therapist who specialises in adoption issues.\n\n\n---------\n\n\nI know this potential reunion nauseates and alarms and worries you, but if this is what he wants, the best you can do is prepare him.

Let the kid decide after he's 18.", "YWBTA - This is something you need to let your son decide. You tell him his dad reached out and wants to meet him, and then you let him determine if he wants to or not. You son will be 18 and his bio dad can reach out to him at that point. Do you really want his bio dad telling him that he asked you guys to see him but you \"kept him from him\"? That would probably just cause more issues. I know you are nervous but I don't know anyone who's had a loving family home and when a bio parent shows up the child just say fuck the person who has raised them.

But nothing will ever break the bond you have with him. You raised him and no one who didnt have the \u26bd\ufe0f\u26bd\ufe0f to raise their kid is going to mess that up. My older sister met her biological dad when she was in middle school/ high school, she calls him her sperm donor because he left her and didn\u2019t even contact her till then .

And he has his own feelings and opinions on the matter. If he wants to meet this man, he has a right to. But maybe he doesn't want to.

I\u2019m with almost everyone else here. Your son is old enough to make this decision himself, obviously with the support of his parents and maybe even a therapist.

After some pre-meet therapy for son (if son is interested in meeting) 2. NOT for his 18th birthday. The fact that this guy wants to make it some kind of birthday present tells you that this guy is centering himself as the main character in this story. Let your son have a proper 18th birthday and then talk to him about all of this.\n\nAlso, this guy is manipulative and clever. He reached out to YOU to request the meeting. Very Scar from The Lion King. Appear to defer. Make other plans behind the scenes.", "YTA. Let Alex decide. I\u2019m sure it will not change the way he feels about you.", "If you don't and he finds out later, you're taking a huge risk of him being angry with you. Ask him, let it be his decision. I'm sure he knows what his mother went through because of his bio-dad, so he will take that into consideration. You'll always be his Dad, the man who raised him, the man who stepped up and CHOSE to be his father.", "This is a big decision for HIM to make. You\u2019ve raised him with your values and you need to trust that he will make the right decision. And to be clear, him deciding never to speak to his biological father not the right decision. The choice he makes becomes right by virtue of him making it. \n\nYou need to be prepared for all possible outcomes including him deciding that he wants to treat his biological father as his father. Your obligation begins and ends with supporting him through whatever decision he makes even if you don\u2019t like it.", "I think he will be an adult so you could either be supportive or not, but pay the consequences if not. I would suggest that a bday party m if he not be the best place to first meet him however.", "The only person who could and should make that decision in my opinion is your son. I'd talk to him about it and see what HE wants to do.\n\nAnd if he decides he wants to meet the sperm donner, you shouldn't take it as him wanting to find someone better than you but him wanting to know where he comes from. Which is extremely normal. I'm telling you this, because like you said, you have a bias (normal), even resentment (again, normal) towards that guy but you also seem to have resentement towards the possibility of your son wanting to know the other guy. Carefull not to project your insecurities onto your son's action/decision. I am absolutely not judging here, I'd have mine too if I were in that situation. I'd be scared as hell also.\n\nMy take is let him know the sperm donner wants to see him and if your son goes ahead, I would recommand both of you to go to counselling before he meets him and after.\n\nYour son shouldn't walk blindly into that situation. The chances are that a lot of disappointment could come out of it. Call me pessimistic if you want, but I'd rather be prepared than not.", "I am that kid. \nMy bio father died and I wonder about him every day.

If you act jealous and petty  it will only negatively affect how your son sees you. What you should be doing is letting it be his decision, and supporting him 100% no matter how it turns out. \nIf you take the high road you will probably be a source of support and consistency and trust for him. If you let your emotions take over you will be the source of stress and anxiety.\nThink about it.", "YWBTA if you do this. More importantly, your son is 17, old enough to make those decisions for himself. He might resent you for taking that choice away. You have already stated you love your son and he loves you and you are his father. I think it is important for your son to meet this man, if he chooses to, and learn about him. He knows the whole story by now, I assume? He is certainly old enough to know his history. Show your son you respect him and explain his choices and get him counseling, if desired, to help him understand the many feelings and reactions meeting his sperm donor might stimulate in him.", "YTA.   This is entirely up to your ADULT son.  It is not for you to decide at all.\n\nI strongly encourage you to pass the invitation on with full disclosure of who this is.

This is Alex\u2019s decision.\n\nI will say, it would be beneficial if you helped Alex find a therapist to help him process it all, help him come to understand the potential outcomes of a possible reunion, manage his expectations, possible disappointment, and the general complexity of emotions that a potential reunion with a biological parent can bring. \n\nYou will be the AH if you make this decision for Alex. If you take away Alex\u2019s decision and his right to meet his biological father (he has every right to if he chooses), then that will be more damaging to your relationship with Alex. \n\nYou should not be threatened by the biological father if you have been an upstanding father figure to Alex. \n\nIf Alex decided to pursue a relationship with his biological father, then you need to accept that. \n\nIt is entirely possible for Alex to have two fathers in his life, and it would be selfish to create a competition. \n\nI advise that you center Alex, not yourself in this.\nThis should be about Alex, not you.", "YWBTA - This needs to be your son\u2019s decision, not yours or your wife\u2019s, and he needs your support as his father regardless of what he chooses.

No need to conflate the issues, IMO.)\n\nI'd tell my child that the inquiry was made and I've had time to process it and go forward as a parent.

This is a 3 year old randomly trying to cross the street without any awareness of danger (so we protect and teach them), a 13 year old wanting to ride their bike to their friends house for the first time on their own (so we map out the route, implement rules regarding messaging when there and leaving etc.) and 16 year olds getting their license or taking the subway (so we teach them or navigate the subway with them). \n\nWe provide them the level of independence that is appropriate to not only their age, but also based on their individual self. For me, this means we treat them as humans, which includes being honest and not keeping information about them away from them. The fact that the bio-dad messaged, while also saying he's comfortable not saying the relationship is a bit of a red flag, as his \"son\" isn't a tourist attraction. \n\nI would say:\n\n1. You and your wife should talk to your son. Let him know. He may not need to know he abandoned his partner (mom), that is up to you what you think your son can handle and how he'll respond to this, specifically since it involves the physical and emotional safety of his mother. Again, that's yours to decide, just saying it cause some may say DON'T and some may say \"TELL HIM EVERYTHING\". We're not the experts on the details of that conversation. We're just the folks saying if we would or wouldn't. And I know I would. \n2. If he says yes, you're his dad. When he's 40, you're his dad and he is your child. For me that means I will do everything in my power, and with my sons blessing to be there for him and protect him. You can lay down the law on his bio-dad for your sons protection. No lies, you meet from 1-3, we're there and will be somewhere off to the side. etc. I honestly don't know, but I would say ask a therapist or someone recommendations. \n3. If he says no, you're his dad. You can tell your son to tell him, including through your facebook account, or you can ask if your son wants you to tell him. Including \"no contact unless your son decides to initiate (through you or directly). \n\nIn regards to him messaging you. I agree, he could have messaged his ex. I wonder if he was thinking \"man of the house\" and trying to pay you the respect you've earned and deserve as a parent and a father. Biological or not, father is a hard role, as is mother, and you clearly have done a great job being that for your son! Congrats! Happy Holidays to you and your family.", "I don't think he should meet Alex at his birthday party, that would probably ruin the mood to have a revelation made that this stranger was his biological father.\n\nBut I don't think you can stop Alex from meeting his bio-father if he really wants to.

You WBTA if you kept this from your son and didn\u2019t discuss it with him first before rejecting the bio dads offer.\nKudos to you for bringing up your son and being such a wonderful father figure to him.

Some of those half siblings have expressed interest in communicating with her. Because she is a young adult she has the right to know about this and make her own decision and be supported by me no matter what her decisions are. I will apply no pressure one way or the other and am available for her to express her feelings and offer advice if she asks for it. My feelings, ego, and fears have no place in her decision making process. \n\nI would be wary of allowing the sperm donor to try and make this a birthday surprise, that seems like a really selfish request.

Hopefully he comes out of it appreciating you all the more.\n\nI had my own father issues and needed to figure those things out on my own. My brother and sister who were quite a bit younger took slightly different paths through that process but in the end we all saw who he was and were glad to have minimal contact.

My husband moved us to the UK to be with him. We thought it would be best to let our son decide whether he wanted to be in touch with his father. However, my ex, being a narcissist, tried to play daddy with his toddler over the iPad. When the child wasn\u2019t being a good enough supply, he stopped answering him. It was hard to watch, but as our son gets older, he says he isn\u2019t interested in having contact with his bio dad.  \nI suggest giving your son the opportunity to have a relationship with his bio dad. If you don\u2019t, this man may use it as an excuse to cause a rift between you and your boy. He may even make up stories that you kept him away all these years. Just be prepared for the love bombing stage and the inevitable heartbreak your son will face once this guy shows his true colors. It may take a month or a year, but the mask will eventually fall and you will unfortunately have to be there to pick up the pieces.", "Well, i had a similar circumstance. \nMy step dad came on the scene when i was 15. \nI had seen my dad once when I was 8, for a week, and never heard anything again. \nWhen I was turning 18, i asked if it was okay to find my dad and meet him. \nI was going to fly across the country to meet him, with my own money. \nMy mum and step dad understood. \n\nUntil 2 days before hand, when they decided that if i wanted to know my dad so bad, they must not mean anything to me, so they kicked me out and my luggage turned from a few day trip into all my worldly possessions i could fit. They said i had \u2018burnt my bridges\u2019 and not to return. So the few days before i pulled my self from my nursing degree. \n\nI still went there, and ended up staying with my dad for a while. a few months. \nI did learn a lot in an australian outback setting compared to a metro city.. more importantly i realised that while my dad and i had similarities that he was a sook, took no responsibility for the lacklustre relationship and expected our relationship to be something from a hallmark movie. \n\nI moved back after I found some questionable photos of me sleeping on his camera. \nI did not tell my mum and step dad I moved back and instead got into a well paying, reputable job and started my own life. \n\nYou may have some concern about Alex meeting his father, but as a young adult-you should probably trust him enough now to make his own decisions about family and values. Adolescents aren\u2019t stupid\u2026 we know they aren\u2019t around and that adults should take lead roles in communicating, and when they don\u2019t for so long.. we blame them. \nEven if they were friendly now, it will not take away the last 18 years of absence. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t get in the way of it, despite how it appears as a slap in the face for all you have done, it\u2019s important to see it for ourselves and rely on our own experiences not what we are told. \nThe jealousy of the situation is what drove me away from the people I call my parents. \nBut..

Make sure he understands he has zero obligation to the deadbeat.  If he says no, that\u2019s the easier choice.  No.  Is a complete sentence and it will carry much more weight if it comes from your son instead of you making the decision for him.

I inquire about that because bio dad might be an even bigger deadbeat than originally thought and looking to cash in. Is Alex going to college where when he graduates he will get a good job with decent pay? All things considered, it's been 18 years and the sudden interest leaves a bit to be desired.

He may want a relationship with him after meeting him, but only time can be told. You can't force him to never meet him. He will go to meet him eventually, whether that be with you or without. My advice is to be there for him and go with him to meet his dad in a public space. That's how I met my biological mother, and it went swimmingly. Find common interests and limit contact to only with you or mom there. You never know someone's criminal/drug/gang history, and it's best to play it safe.

I understand the anxiety, however if he chooses to have a relationship with his biological dad then that should be left up to him, not you or his mom. Sit down and have a father-son talk with him, tell him the truth and ask if he wants to meet this man. You will have your answer and you can tell the guy to go pound sand, or let him know Alex agreed to meet.\n\nYWBTA if you decided this for him.\n\nYWNBTA if you let him make the decision", "You\u2019ve indicated you don\u2019t know why he abandoned his kid.

Why not after his birthday? you need to talk to Alex first and he has to decide!!!! but I think it is good to go to counseling or therapy because if it was my son I will not do that just because he really is asking on the 18th birthday. I will not want my son on his 18th birthday  to meet him. This is because birthday is a very big milestone for him to remember and I would not want him to associate it that today he had a meeting with his father and what if it doesn\u2019t go well, you have a bad association in the future with anything that in relation  to his birthday", "100%", "YWBTA. \n\nThis is something only your son gets to decide. He has a right to know and make the decision himself about whether or not he wants to go down that path. \n\nAs others have said, I would also have Alex go through some therapy leading up to and after meeting his father as it will be a lot to go through especially after so long. I doubt he really remembers anything at all from his biological dad. \n\nI get how this makes you feel...but it's not up to you. Think about it this way, what if Alex finds out that his father reached out and you neglected to even tell him and give him the option of a decision?

That's always going to be a risk with absent parents.\n\nBut on the other hand, you don't know why he left. Yes, he's a deadbeat now, but you're not even giving him the chance to correct that.  \nOf course, he could be reaching out superficially and Alex could get hurt, but he could also be resentful of his actions and genuinely want a connection with his son.\n\nI've never met my dad either. I have no solid father figure, and i'm quite content and confident with that role being absent because to me it doesn't feel like anything's missing.  \nIn fact, there was a restraining order placed against him on my behalf that expired when I was 18.  \nBut if my dad reached out to my grandparents (they got custody of me when I was 5), before my 18th birthday, and my granparents turned him down for me instead of giving me the choice to meet him, I wouldn't be able to forgive them for robbing me of that opportunity.  \nWhile i'm confident and comfortable not having a dad, I do still wonder what he looks like, what his medical history is. It pains me to look in the mirror and see my dad's eyes looking back at me (they're hazel and my mother's entire bloodline has grey//blue/greyish blue eyes).\n\nConsidering your wife is neutral on the situation, it feels like the real issue here is you fearing you'll be replaced.  \nYou've raised him since he was a baby, you've earnt the title of dad, and he clearly sees you as his dad or he wouldn't call you by that title.\n\nThe best thing to do here is to give this decision to Alex and explain to him that if he did choose to meet his bio dad that it could go either way and to prepare him for as many outcomes as possible.  \nI'd also say get him therapy, even if you don't feel like you need it, so then he has somewhere to talk through things properly, cos meeting an absent parent can be alot for anyone to handle (nevermind a teenager).

If you decide that you're okay with it you may want to ask Alex if he even wants to and then set him up for therapy, like other posters have suggested, to prepare him if he says yes. He may say no. I don't think his birthday is the appropriate time. Sometimes people that come back into someone's life want to come at a major event and I think it adds to trying to make it special. There is something off about that to me. He should wait until after so that Alex's birthday is about him and you all can enjoy it as a family before this man comes into his life.

His moral compass is set by his mom and you, but many things he also received from his father even if he never met him. He needs to know this part of himself to understand himself in the future.

That he left his mom homeless, for starters.\n\nBut you can't take that decision away from your son, no matter how well intentioned you are in doing so.

He will respect you for treating him as an adult. Also, don't let the bio dad's use of \"my son\" bother you. Our language doesn't really have a suitable word to use here. Just rise above it all and be the bigger man. Give your son the opportunity to meet his bio dad, if he's interested in doing it. My son (31M) connected with his bio mom when he was about 20 years old. I didn't object at all; in fact, I encouraged it. They spoke a handful of times, and that was it.

And there is inherently a huge risk of him finding out later that you never passed the message along, and that very well could come with its own can of worms.\n\nCelebrate him.\nTell him.\nLet him choose(on his time).\nSupport his choice.\nContinue to be his father.", "It's Alex's decision, not yours.", "Ok in this situation, I\u2019m basically Alex except my now step dad has met my biological dad. I\u2019m 16 and am yet to have this experience but I for one would NOT want to meet that fucking bastard ever again. I\u2019m literally in basically the same situation as Alex, like almost exactly the same. I can tell you that from my perspective, I have my dad, he\u2019s great and I couldn\u2019t ask for a better one and this guy was just some stupid sperm donor. Now Alex might think differently and in the end it is his life and maybe should be his choice. I would say, just in passing, trying to keep it casual something like \u201cIt you had the chance, would you wanna meet your biological father?\u201d Just out of curiosity. If he says yes, then you have to fight away your own thoughts and feelings and let him meet his dad. Or, if you\u2019re feeling a little braver and think your son, wife and yourself can handle the hard conversation, tell him directly that his dad has asked to meet him. Do whatever he says. A very well known comedian Gabriel Iglesias was in the same situation as you and told his son up front what he wanted to do and that was one of the most heartfelt stories he told at his shows. His son said no he doesn\u2019t want to meet his dad. If you\u2019re afraid your son might not take the conversation too well, then maybe ask him in passing but if you think he will be able to, then tell him upfront.

I hope you find a solution and that you and your son are able to maintain a positive and healthy relationship.

I would like to met him if given the chance. I have questions, I have medical questions as well. My adopted dad even gave his approval and that meant the most to me. \n\nYou will still be his dad.

Shows some sort of awareness of the delicate situation. Though not so much that he thinks the 18th birthday is the place to do it.....", "This was my situation. My dad adopted and raised me after he married my mom when my donor left. \n\nHonestly, I would support your son and not deny him this opportunity. \n\nI also encourage your not to feel insecure about this, and I can assure you that YOU will be the man he brings home to care for when you are old. No man will ever compare to you. You will forever be his dad. Now after having two of my own kids, I appreciate everything that man did for me even more. I am so incredibly thankful my donor or biological father left. I ended up getting an incredible opportunity, I literally got the best dad ever out of it.", "Yes you would be/are if you do what you plan to do. It's easier and hurts less to let them figure out themselves to a certain point. Unless the parent in question is severely addicted to drugs, alcohol, rapest, etc. those exceptions are based on my opinion. But if he/she is none of the above and they are capable of being a parent to a certain extent then why not? If it's just some petty grudge then you should just swallow your pride and be the better parent for your kid no matter how much it hurts you. Those are the sacrifices we make for our children. Agree or disagree but I'd be pretty pissed if I had a parent shut off from my life completely over a pretty grudge.", "He needs to meet him.....u try to deny him that your automatically the shitty parent.

The kid deserves the chance to decide and no matter what OP can support him\nand be there for him when things go south or don't.  Let him know you want to make sure he is safe and to make the right choices and to let you know if anything inappropriate is ever said or asked like for money, or to do anything that you wouldn't ask a stranger because the guy is a stranger.    I honestly don't understand why the choice wouldn't go towards the kid who is about to be a legal adult.", "I say go ahead and let him meet his bio dad. It won\u2019t hurt anything, and it certainly won\u2019t change what he thinks about you.", "Fellow adoptee here. This is really good advice.\n\nNo one could ever replace my real parents. You know, the ones who raised me. Who made dinner and showed up at my stupid school crap and grounded me for breaking curfew and made me get a job to understand the value of money. The ones who were there when I skinned my knee, had my wisdom teeth taken out, went to prom, taught me to ride a bike, held my hand when I got my heart broken. \n\nBut also? Nothing would piss me off more than those amazing parents thinking so little of me and our relationship that they tried to exclude me about a decision regarding my birth parents once I was old enough to be part of those decisions. \n\nThis isn't a decision for OP or the wife. This decision belongs to the adoptee.", "I can't believe there aren't more comments about this.  He never even mentions what Alex wants.  His son's wishes are not a concern to him at all.  This is all about him.", "This is what I was going to say, that if you prevent Alex from meeting his biological father he very well could resent you.  I\u2019m betting that even if he wants to know his bio father more, his bio father will eventually show his true colors.  Hang in there I\u2019m betting Alex is a really smart young man.", "That is true, getting a therapist can take a significant amount of time, especially if you're using insurance for it. But that's OK, it's been a very long time already, there's no reason that meeting the bio dad can't wait six months. If the bio dad really wants what's best for the kid, he'll wait.", "A moo point. It's like a cow's opinion, it doesn't matter. It's moo.", "I\u2019m glad someone got it", "I\u2019m not assuming anything. You are attempting to justify wherher or not the adult would like to see the father, or whether the adult would decline. That\u2019s not at all what this is about, your making stuff up. The argument is whether the stepfather should have a right to allow or not allow his stepson to see his father. He is not allowed to do that. This kid will be an adult on his birthday, and can make his own decisions."]}
