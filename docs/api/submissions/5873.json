She got into many fights with her older brother and when my husband tried to stop them from fighting she called him a jerk. She told me my cooking sucks and refused to eat her dessert and said she doesn't want raisin pudding. She didn't take her presents and called us cheap for buying her \"some rubbish\" and kept bragging about what her dad bought for her to her brothers. She was on her phone and barely even talked to us\n\nFinally I got tired and told her now that she is not interested in spending christmas with us she won't have to. Then sent her to her room.\n\nI love my daughter but I admit as soon as she went to her room everyone seemed happier and We had a fun christmas day\n\nMy ex called me and started yelling at me calling me an asshole and saying how dare I sent her to her room and if I didn't want to spend christmas day with her then I should have let him have her. \n\nI think I was justified and she needed this but he clearly disagrees so AITA?", "created_utc": 1672253434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxhiss/aita_for_sending_my_daughter_to_her_room_on/", "score": 582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A 13 year old who is forced to be away from the parent that likes her during Christmas is going to be grumpy and out of sorts.\n\nAlso: in what world is raisen pudding a dessert and not a punishment?", "Info..you said your ex agreed she deserved to be punished for her behavior. What did he propose you should have done instead?", "YTA -- reading through your comments, she did not want to be there. She wants to be with her dad. You forced her to come and then punished her for not performing by sending her to her room and enjoying Christmas without her. So why didn't you just let her stay where she felt loved and wanted? Seems she doesn't feel that way at your house and is expressing it like a 13 yr old would. Rather than punishing her, you should be trying to connect and understand why she doesn't want to be around you and your family. That is the issue. That is why she is acting out. You are punishing her for trying to communicate something. You are the adult. You are the one who should be doing the work to bridge communication and meet some clearly unmet needs. Instead, you punish her and openly state that you enjoyed your Christmas more with her being shut in her room.", "INFO: how many days was she with you, and how did you approach her crappy behavior in those days? How long was she sent to her room? Did you have anything special to do with her?", "INFO - what is your relationship with her like outside Christmas? Do you spend time with her away from your husband and sons?", "INFO\n\nThere's a lot of context missing that might be too personal. Without knowing the full extent of your relationship with her, your ex, why you broke up, how her brothers treat her, if you and your husband treat her equal to them, etc it's impossible to know if her attitude is justified or not.\n\nIf she's just being a brat, sure - you're right to discipline her. I'd probably do the same with the caveat of \"you're welcome to come down when you're ready to behave\" - make her feel welcome but that the attitude will not be tolerated.\n\nIf she has a legitimate reason to dislike being there, which I can only assume we would never get because parents often don't realize they are treating kids from a previous relationship differently, then you might be the asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Holy shit YTA. Girl gets some clothes and a book. The boys get a laptop and toys. Even if he \"needed it for school\" she's going to see that as favoritism. You son's \"need\" shouldn't be given as a gift in front of his sister who got something worth significantly less. \n\nAlso all of these comments are constantly she, she, she. You are so eager to put blame on her without ever asking why she's upset or understanding why she might be. \n\nYou talk about your daughter like she's some kind of burden to you and your new family while you're the one that forced her to be there! \n\nOP it sounds like you have most likely significantly damaged the relationship between you and your daughter and until you're ready to take some of the blame it will never get better. You and your husband need to treat her the same way you treat the boys and probably look into some professional help to repair the damage that's been done. Otherwise you will never see her again when she's old enough to make that choice.", "INFO not enough detail in my opinion. What did you actually get her for Christmas, and how is your relationship typically? Did you try to force her to eat dessert? Would you have treated an adult the same way?", "Info: Did she even want to spend Christmas with you?", "Info: did your daughter have any choice about where she had to spend Christmas?", "Info: By 'send to her room' you mean you basically kicked her out of celebrating Christmas at all?", "Okay, I know I\u2019m getting downvoted for this but\u2026\n\nYTA \n\nHere is why. I also have a 13F daughter that was VERY difficult on Christmas. Hormonal, moody, picking on her siblings and being an overall pain in the behind. \n\nMy husband and I choose to \u201cignore\u201d this behavior on Christmas Day for the sake of family peace. I calmly told her several times, \u201cyou\u2019re not being kind to us on Christmas,\u201d and simply asked her to tone it down.  We didn\u2019t \u201cpunish\u201d her or send her to her room, we just for the most part ignored. At the end of Christmas night I wrote her a letter explaining how her behavior hurt me and how sad I was and difficult she made the day for all of us. Slipped the note into her room.  The following morning she was all hugs, tears and apologies. We both hugged it out and she promised to do better. \n\nSo again, I vote YTA because you failed to remember that 13 is the worse year ever. Hormones, puberty, testing boundaries and trying to figure everything out. At this age, kids need a lot of extra love more than \u201ctough\u201d love. \n\nI am afraid the way you chose to handle this situation is going to cause long term harm to your relationship. \n\nOf course your daughter was being a total brat but as a mom you need to give her some extra love right now. That\u2019s just my humble opinion of someone who went through the exact same thing but ended up with a better outcome.", "YTA\n\nShe clearly didn't like the raisin pudding.\n\nYou also got 15M a laptop, 8M toys but got her clothes and a book...", "YTA: your daughter is not an adult. As someone who has studied psychology, including developmental psychology, I have to say you handled this wrong. A bratty teen may be unpleasant, but you put her into an environment where she had every right to be upset.\n\nNo young person wants to see their parent moving on with a new family. Which is EXACTLY what you confirmed you are doing. You sent her away and then had the AUDACITY to say your Christmas was BETTER because of. That it made you HAPPIER not to have your daughter with your new family.\n\nOf course she over compensates by bragging about how much her father loves her. Right now your daughter is spiraling and you risk losing her altogether. The first step is to apologize for not handling Christmas evening better. Explain you did what you did out of pain, but that doesn't make it right. Offer to spend a whole day with just you and her and keep to that promise. Ask her to be open about her feelings when she is overwhelmed by emotion, even if she doesn't know WHY she's feeling these emotions.\n\nIt is not the job of a child to recognize their mental state is out of balance, it is the parents. You failed to do that because you put your comfort ahead of your child's emotional well being.", "INFO what time did you send her to her room and when did she get out? Did she get to do anything with you on Christmas?", "feels like a lot of information is missing from this. it sounds like she didn\u2019t want to be there, so not sure why she was and not with her dad. also what was her older brother doing that made her fight him so much?", "judging from your comments you made your daughter spend christmas with you, even when you knew she didnt want to.

Spending christmas with me and her brothers once in a while would be nice\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly, then it seems like you're the reason she's spending the Christmas at your place more than by her own choice. So tell me, how do you expect a teenager you've forced to spend a holiday with you behave? Let alone that, you also send her to her room, therefore ruining said holiday for her?", "As someone who this has happened to she aint never going to forgive you. YTA. she's 13... I'm willing to bet she doesn't even understand why she is reacting.", "INFO - Did you give her the option of returning? Like, \"Go to room until you're ready to not be rude?\" or the like?", "YTA you don't seem particularly interested in being a parent to her. You claim that your relationship is \"fine\". Clearly it isn't. Did you try calmly talking to her, away from everyone else? If she refused to eat dessert, guess what? She doesn't eat dessert. Sending your daughter who you seemingly don't spend much time with to her room for most of Christmas is a dick move.", "YTA \n\nShe chose not to live with you when her brother does live with you. Your relationship can't be \"fine\" \n\nYou forced her to be where she didn't want to be at christmas, and then banished her for being a 13 year old girl who is unhappy. \n\nHow did you try to make the situation better by sending her to her room? \n\nAll it seems to have revealed is you like her not being around.", "Forced her to come then locked her in her room? Easy YTA", "YTA. Your comments are poor cringe. You should have let that poor girl, who you seem to disdain in parenting, spend Christmas with her dad. Which is what she wanted.", "YTA, for serving raisin pudding.", "YTA.\nYou force her to spend a holiday with you when she doesn't want to and you're somehow stumped she has an attitude?\nShe didn't want to be with you. She wanted to be with her father. YOU pushed it so she didn't get a say, really. \n\nSure, she needed a punishment for being rude but to essentially banish her into her room for the entirety of Christmas is too far, and frankly you've likely done your relationship with her no favours. It's clear even to us reddit strangers that she does not enjoy your company, and I can understand why if this behaviour of YOURS is how you are on a day to day basis.\n\nIn one foul swoop, you have just legitimised every grievance she has with you and shown her that YOU, a parent, cannot be bothered to effectively discipline your child. Instead opting to take the easy way out so you can have a 'nice Christmas'. \n\nIt was a lazy punishment, with absolute zero attempt to understand why she might be mad.\n\nDo better, otherwise you may find she doesn't want a relationship with you at all.", "lowkey i think YTA bc she made it clear she didn't wanna be there and you insisted and then were shocked when she acted like she didn't wanna be there. there is almost no information in this post about her or your relationship and based on your comments i think that's intentional", "Based on your responses along with the post, YTA.\n\nWhile yes, some of this is normal teenage behavior- most of it stems from the fact that you don\u2019t really know your daughter- and you don\u2019t seem to care about that. \n\nIn your entire post & responses, you are very general and almost aloof in terms of your daughters likes, dislikes, wants & needs. So now your daughter is spending Christmas at a place she feels unwanted, then sent to her room for the entire day while her mom celebrates Christmas with her \u201creal family\u201d.", "YTA. 13 year old girls have a lot of emotions and sometimes this comes out in a way that is upsetting to others. It seems like we\u2019re missing some context here, as you said she chose to live with her Dad. I\u2019m guessing she has some underlying issues with you. Rather than trying to figure out what she was clearly upset about, you banished her to her room. What makes you think she\u2019ll want to visit you at all now?", "Yta and again on top for lying in your post.

You sending her away to her room like you did, on Christmas no less, you are going to push her further away. You are the parent here, you HAVE to be the one moving towards her until she feels reassured that she can move back towards you too. If I found out my mother felt and said the things you have after she was sent away, I would feel incredibly hurt.

She didn\u2019t want to be with you to begin with- so you forced her and are now angry she\u2019s not enjoying herself or eating raisin pudding (I wouldn\u2019t want eat that either tbh)", "Clearly something is going on that she is not telling you. For some reason she hates being at your house, it would be good to know what that reason is. Sending her to her room does not solve anything, if only, it will make things worse. So for that I think YTA, even though it lightened the mood for the rest of the family. But she is your responsibility and I think you could/should have handled it better.", "Yes, YTA.  What kind of a monster expects any child to eat raising pudding? And on Christmas no less?  Seriously, dessert is supposed to be a treat, not a punishment, and even when it is good (i.e. raisin free), I've never heard of a parent trying to force their child to eat it.  The rest of it sounds like she was upset to have to be there and acting out. I'm not saying her manners weren't deplorable, but did you take into consideration how she may have wanted to spend Christmas? Also, she learned those manners from someone.

No. It was an honest mistake with minor consequences and I seemingly am prepared to deal with it appropriately.\n\nHowever, further in the replies I reveal that this is the fourth time in the last 90 days that I have needed someone else to cover a dinner bill for me. Additionally, a friend lent me $500 to cover car expenses one month ago and I have only paid back $200. I have also never returned the favors for other friends.\n\nGuess what? Now I am an asshole. Because although the isolated incident of me being $10 short doesn't in itself make me an asshole, it looks completely different once viewed within a broader scope of previous behaviors.\n\nThe problem here isn't a single incident in which a 13-year-old was angsty and OP sent her to her room. OP is an asshole because she does not see the bigger picture and punishment is the only mechanism by which she addresses her daughter's behaviors.\n\nHere's one way in which she could have been both disciplinary and empathetic. She punishes the daughter and sends her to her room. The next day, she asks the daughter to sit down with her following a brunch or day at the nail salon and asks her why she has been acting this way with a tone that indicates she is concerned and ready to listen rather than interrogative.", "One of the most traditional Christmas desserts in English homes is plum pudding - which is actually made with raisins and isn't \"pudding\" in the US sense. I wonder if this isn't something similar?", "That\u2019s true, except the vast majority of the dried fruit in traditional plum puddings are usually currants. - like spotted dick. Sultanas and raisins plump to most of the size of the grapes they used to be. That\u2019s an overwhelming amount of a standard dessert spoonful (not even counting that raisins usually have a thicker and chewier skin to contend with). As a both pudding consumer and an ex pastry chef, I can\u2019t support a raisin pudding."]}
