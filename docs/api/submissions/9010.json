This is on your sister for raising a kid that behaves like this.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s your birthday dinner and your decision. Your sister needs to raise her child properly and teach him how to behave.\n\nYour birthday dinner shouldn\u2019t turn into an event where your nephew makes your girlfriend feel terrible about herself.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a little rich for her to be calling you immature when she clearly hasn\u2019t matured enough to actually attempt to be a parent.\n\nHim calling your GF fatty is enough for me to exclude him until your sister can get that in check.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want a kid like that at my birthday dinner either.", "NTA - this is your party. No other children are going. It\u2019s reasonable to want an adult only affair.\n\nThis isn\u2019t really you being immature either. This child is ruining family events with his behaviour.

It sounds like the rest of you may need to set boundaries with him as well.  If he takes 5 macaroons take 4 back.
