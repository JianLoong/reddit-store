You have every right not to invite him and your sister is TA for not actually parenting her own child! By that age, a child should know better than to do all that! It's one thing if he's on the autism spectrum as learning things takes longer, but I feel like the sister would say that and you'd in return tell us. But it doesn't sound like that. It sounds like your sister is just a lazy parent. She's making excuses for his behavior and he's absolutely not going to grow out of it! If he's not actually taught not to do those things by her doing something about it, then he won't know better and will behave this way when he's older. In return, he'll learn that lesson the hard way by getting excluded from parties and having friends who don't put up with the behavior and leave the friendship. She's not doing him any favors, and frankly, if she can't understand that her own actions also have consequences, then there's something wrong with her. She's literally just making you feel guilty for her own actions. That's probably not intentional, but it could be. She chooses not to properly parent her own child and expects that he'll be invited to everything, even behaving that way. Oh no, my actions require me to get a babysitter or not go to a family party. What a disaster! Don't feel bad for that at all. You did nothing wrong. Your sister is the problem here and I'd personally just not invite her to any further parties because I can't stand people who have children and don't even bother to teach them simple things like right from wrong. What she needed to do when he took all the macaroons was to take ever single one of them off of his plate except for one and he can watch as everyone else eats their because they didn't have his name on them! It might be harsh to say that he can watch while everyone else eats their's, but I mean if everyone is sitting and enjoying muching on things, they're not going to just discreetly eat it.

Btw, I have 3 kids under the age of 10...", "But the uncle doesn't owe a badly behaved child his time and attention, even if the kid is doing his best. It doesn't sound like the boy's parents have done anything to correct him insulting OP's gf, or the food issues, so why give him/them more chances to ruin events. I have a 6 year old daughter who is very well behaved and even she understands that not everything is a kid-centered activity. The kid is not going to live the rest of his life thinking his uncle hates him - maybe if he gets uninvited from enough parties, especially by peers, he'll improve his behavior.", "Look I'm not going to argue with you, I'm just going to point out that if other kids were invited, but the nephew was not, it would have given his mother's point about being \"a grown man excluding a kid from a party\" more credence. Hence, why I asked.", "1. I said it was optional, but would be a good thing. I never said he owed his nephew anything. But if he cares about his nephew and his nephew's feelings and wants to do something for him that is not inviting him to the party, then this might be a compromise. (He can care about him and not do something, too! I'm just throwing out a suggestion!) \n\n2. It's not about what his sister has or hasn't done. If she's a lousy parent, even more reason to step up with the nephew, because he needs positive adults in his life. Don't punish the kid because you don't like sister.\n\n3. That's why I was suggesting they do something SEPARATE. So the kid doesn't \"ruin another event.\" That won't be good for anyone, including the kid. So I'm saying to go somewhere the kid is more likely to behave or where they can have fun. A lot of kids thrive with one-on-one situations who struggle in larger situations.\n\n4. Your child has literally nothing to do with this child. Congratulations on being such a great parent, I guess?\n\n5. Memories of rejection by family stick and stick hard for kids and if there's a chance to bond with him separately from this event, that's a GOOD THING. It might not traumatize him! But it won't be good for him and I promise, he's not going to learn anything about his behavior from being disinvited, not in practical terms, not at this age. He may learn from spending positive time with his uncle, however. \n\n6. Why do you think that it's such a terrible idea for the uncle to maybe spend a couple hours hanging out with his nephew before he moves out of the state? That is literally all I am suggesting, if he has the time and inclination.", "NTA. But I can tell you and easy fix for the sharing problem: don\u2019t share with him. Noting. Not even a single pea or chips. \n\nAnd just say \u201cif you don\u2019t have to share neither do I.\u201d And stick to it.\n\nTrust me it works, we did it often enough in the after school center I worked in.", "NTA and the best thing your sister could do is tell him upfront why you aren't inviting him. When you behave like an animal people don't want to invite you to come over.
