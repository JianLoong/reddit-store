{"id": 20307, "submission_id": "14fyx46", "title": "AITA for telling my dad to bring my little brother his extra glasses tomorrow as he lost his main pair.", "selftext": "So I (M18) have an 8 year old brother, we will call him Jack. Jack has to wear glasses as he has weakened muscles within the eye that mess with his long distance eye sight, and as such we bought him two pairs of glasses. Since he's little we didn't want to leave it to chance to just buy one. Well yesterday we noticed that Jack didn't have his glasses at all, and that he couldn't find them. Mum ended up asking why he didn't have them and where they went, he said that they were at our Nana's who lives about two hours away. We call her and she says that they are not there as he didn't bring them at all the last time he came. \n\nSo we have completely lost his main pair of glasses, thankfully we have an extra pair which he had left at dad's house (Yeah he's forgetful but we are trying to work on that with him). So I call my dad who is picking him up to take him to school. I call and ask how far he is and then say \"Hey, Jack has lost his glasses and thought it was at Nanas, but they aren't there. Tomorrow can you bring his glasses when you pick him up for school?\" My dad responds with \"If I remember\" I was kinda surprised and was like \"Dad the kid needs his glasses, if your gonna forget them set an alarm.\" he proceeded to get upset and say \"Oh get over yourself!\" And hung up on me. \n\nShortly after when he picked up jack he came and said that I shouldn't be on a high horse considering that I forget things too and that I apparently haven't been going to family events or doing what I need to do, so telling him to set an alarm for tomorrow is disrespectful and that I had absolutely no leg to stand on and that since it's not in his normal schedule, he cannot control whether or not he remembers. \n\nI feel like he deflected and tried to excuse his forgetfulness because of things that I gave apparently forgotten. He even used the example of when I packed jacks bag two years ago and accidentally forgot underwear (Silly mistake which I felt pretty bad for at the time).\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687426758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fyx46/aita_for_telling_my_dad_to_bring_my_little/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s child abuse, what they\u2019ve put you through.", "NTA. Your dad is being sensitive, and needs to get over himself. maybe you could have used a different approach, but the fact is that a father has the responsibility to care for his kids, and not to fuck up basic shit like remembering glasses. I regularly run into stuff like this with my own kids, and I know I can be a bonehead, so I swallow my pride and set copious alarms when things are important. He can do the same.", "NTA. Your dad needs to get over HIMSELF. You\u2019re so young and have so much responsibility parenting your little brother, your dad couldn\u2019t simply bring his son extra glasses when he needs them ? Having concerned for your brother is most definitely not \u201cbeing on a high horse\u201d don\u2019t let him bully you into believing you\u2019re the bad guy when you\u2019re not.", "NTA\n\n\"If I remember\", what a dismissive comment from this child's parent. He's embarrassed that you scolded him but he should be even more embarrassed that you had to.", "NTA - Taking care of your brother does not make you disrespectful. Your dad can definitely control whether or not he remembers by setting reminders, it sounds like he is just choosing not take responsibility. He should be more proactive and understanding of the situation instead of nitpicking at your mistakes. Also, isn't it hypocritical for him to claim he doesn't have control over his memory when he blames you for the same thing he does?", "NTA\n\nEveryone forgets things. It's called being human. Getting defensive when someone reminds you is just an asshole move. I know you probably feel like the asshole but that's what your dear old dad intended. But always remember-- someone else's opinion always says more about them than it does about you. Think long and hard about what your dad is revealing about himself when he gets on your case about a mistake that he made when all you were doing was trying to look out for your brother.", "NTA\n\nSounds a lot like what my narcissist mother would say in retaliation when I called her out on her bullshit.  You're not wrong at all for what you said.  You're looking out for your brother.  Your dad seemed pretty dismissive about it.  Like, he should also care about your brother's glasses.  It's his child, FFS. \n\nBut, he's your dad, so you're not going to be right in his eyes no matter what.  Parents don't like their wrongs pointed out by their kids.  I mean no one likes that, but it brings something out in parents when their kids do it.  Don't keep fighting with him over it, let him think he's won. Take satisfaction in knowing you did the right thing and know that he's a fool for trying to make you see it differently.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I did take it on my own decision to make the call as I was already checking how far he was so there was no reason not to ask. My parents split up and my mother works long long hours. I also enjoy looking after my little brother but sometimes it gets really tough when stuff like this happens.", "Yeah I get it, like he's right that I do forget things to and sometimes I do neglect my responsibilities but that doesn't really mean that I shouldn't be asking him to bring the glasses and that if he feels he won't be able to, to set an alarm to make it so he can. It seems like a lousy excuse to be honest.", "I will say that I don't really 'parent' my brother, there is a lot more on my mother's plate then what is on mine. However I feel like my dad doesn't even really try sometimes and it makes it very difficult.", "Yeah well it\u2019s not your fault they separated and now have a harder job. They clearly don\u2019t respect your time and consider you less than human because anything you want to do is a waste of time or disrespectful, but they can expect whatever they want from you and you have no say? And now their own child must pick up their slack get called ungrateful and like it? Sounds like my narcissist abusive father to a tee.\n\nSorry. You\u2019re a living breathing human with sentience and free will. Take your own damn self into account, because they clearly don\u2019t.", "Don\u2019t buy his frame. NTA", "I will say that my mother very much does, she spoils us quite a bit and it does genuinely bother her that the job she has requires her to be gone from very early in the morning to after Jack gets home from school, my dad on the other hand shows no appreciation at all.", "Just your father then, clearly not enough of a man to take responsibility and his own son is more mature and level headed than him. Sounds like a him problem. Respect goes both ways, especially for kids and parents, because that relationship is how the child builds self confidence and self accountability. He has done neither of these things. He\u2019s just using his authority over you to guilt trip you.\n\nEdit: Oh and that whole \u201cif I remember\u201d comment is classic gaslighting. You know the facts, you know what you told him. Do not let him use your own forgetfulnesses against you to deflect his own shortcomings back at you, and then you feel you can\u2019t call him out. The correct sentence would have been \u201cSorry I forgot.\u201d Shit excuse but at least then he\u2019d be being honest and accountable.\n\nI should clarify I see you as NTA"]}
