{"id": 31882, "submission_id": "185asww", "title": "AITA for being upset that my 25F friend 26F brought her friend 22M to Friendsgiving without the OK from me.", "selftext": "So, just to give a little context, I have a friend group. I have known Lily for most of my life. We grew up together and I have been close with her family including her brother; Sam. We are also close with another friend from Lily and I\u2019s high school; Michelle.  So, this year, I hosted Friendsgiving for our friend group. I invited everybody, and a couple friends brought some of their friends (which was totally fine because they asked if that was ok.) a couple weeks before Friendsgiving I visited Michelle. Michelle is local to the city I live in, and we originally got close because of Lily, but Lily recently moved out of state. So, Michelle and I were talking about Friendsgiving; I explained how it was going to be a full house; and she told me that she invited Sam, Lily\u2019s brother. She did so without checking with me first, and I explained to her that I did not want Sam to be there. Now, Sam and I have been close in years past, but recently he had been really weird towards me; like not even acknowledging me at family events. I thought it may have to do with him and I having a bit of a fling a couple years ago, but am still not sure. The past 6 months my interactions with him have bene minimal and uncomfortable for me. I told Michelle; \u201cI don\u2019t want him there, just tell him you forgot about the details or something\u201d to which she responded \u201cok\u201d and ended the conversation. Flash forward to a couple weeks later; Lily is back in town for Friendsgiving and thanksgiving. We get together to hangout since she is in town and I also explain to her that Sam was invited by Michelle to Friendsgiving but I did not want to come. Lily was very understanding \u201cIts your house, its your rules, that\u2019s fair\u201d. So I\u2019m sure that you would imagine my surprise when Michelle, Lily, and Sam (plus his girlfriend) all walk into Friendsgiving. At this point I was seeing red. Now here is where I might be the asshole. When I get upset at people I tend to get really cold, and I was cold towards Lily, Sam and Michelle. I felt disrespected and hurt that I expressed my feelings so openly and for him to be there. I admit, I did not handle it gracefully, but tried to power through the night and continue hosting. After Lily left, I noticed that she deleted me from Find my friends. I shot her a text message the next day asking to talk about Friendsgiving with no reply. A couple days letter I messaged Michelle about it; expressing my feelings. Michelle and I went back and forth but the just of what she said is \u201cI\u2019m sorry I invited him without your OK, but I thought you were joking when you said you didn\u2019t want him there. I\u2019m not going to apologize for the misunderstanding. I don\u2019t understand why this turned into such a big deal.\u201d Lily still will not talk to me. I am upset, bc this has been my friend group for years, But also, have been trying to reflect on my actions; so Now; I come to you reddit: AITA?", "created_utc": 1701112040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185asww/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_25f_friend_26f/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I unfortunately know someone well who also loves to use the \"I thought\" and \"I didn't know\" defenses when there's no reason for them to have either thought what they claim to have thought and impossible for them to not know.\n\nIt's just a defensive lie.

I disagree. While Lilly didnt directly pick up her brother, his girlfriend and Michelle, she was explicitly told that they were not invited and she COULD have removed herself from that situation. She COULD have arrived separately. She COULD have given you a heads up that not only was her brother coming, but that he has a surprise guest. She COULD have even stood up for you and told Michelle and her brother that what they were planning is wrong. She did nothing and it makes me question if she was in on the plan. Your feelings were not a priority for her. I dont know how harsh your reaction was towards her but for her to assume absolutely no responsibility is crazy. Standing around doing nothing while something you dont want to happen happens, is still doing something and what she did was choose not to support you in any way.", "I can't decide because:\n\n- You just say you were cold, I don't think their reactions are because you were just cold.\n- Why even let them in, you told Lily and Michelle he wasn't invited and let him in. You should have said he isn't allowed in and neither is his gf. If Michelle and Lily said they wouldn't come in if he didn't then apologise if that's what they decide because you wanted them there but they knew he wasn't invited so wish them a good night", "Next year don't invite the trouble makers its your home.", "ESH leaning heavily towards YTA. Your friend shouldn't have invited someone without asking, but everything that happened after that is your fault for sticking your head in the sand and refusing to talk about what was going on like an adult. You should have talked to Sam instead of unilaterally deciding to exclude him from a group activity. Asking other members of your friend group to lie about it is especially fucked up. You took your own problem with one person and made it a problem for everybody, and then you got mad at them when they decided not to play that game. \n\nYour best bet if you want to try and salvage these friendships is to send a heartfelt apology to everyone involved acknowledging your own lack of maturity at handling this situation and ask if there is anything you can do to mend the relationship.", "ESH - I pretty much echo what Michelle said. It was a misunderstanding and did not need to turn into such a big deal. \n\nI also think people lean way too heavily into \u201cfriend groups\u201d and try to control that dynamic too much. Two more people at a friends-giving isnt that big of a deal.", "YTA. Lily didn't do anything. Why did you take it out on her?", "Things didn\u2019t go well with Sam romantically and now both of you, particularly you, would like every friend to choose a side. That\u2019s exhausting.

Michelles boyfriend and him are close etc. but him and I obviously are not", "it baffles me that not only did NEITHER of those two people have the balls to tell sam not to come(one of them is his own sister even), when he presumably asked them if it was ok to bring his girlfriend, they gave him the affirmative knowing OP didn't want him there to begin with?? what a couple of extremely shit friends", "The \"I didn't handle it gracefully\" just refers to the fact that I was a bit cold to all of them, not including them in conversations, not talking to them as much as I usually would; preferring to hang with other people at the gathering.", "Lily is only innocent if she pulled OP aside and apologized as soon as she arrived. Anything other than that and she was in collusion with Michelle.", "I didn't want to talk about it at the party and make a scene. There was literally 10+ others at the party and I didn't feel it was the time or place. I did not ask her to do that; I suggested it. She is the one who invited him without my knowledge and she is the one who is responsible for that mistake and uninviting him. If she felt uncomfortable with that or wanted to have another convo she could have talked to me about that; but it never happened.", "How is telling both Lily and Michelle how you feel result in a misunderstanding? They just decided to do what they wanted to and didn\u2019t care how she would feel. They banked in her being gracious enough not to do anything and FAFO.", "Maybe not to you.", "In the OP, she states that she told Lily she didn\u2019t want Sam there and Lily acknowledged her right to that.", "We both have new partners- lmao I am not hungup over him. I am justifiably upset bc he now ignores me in social situations instead of at least being cordial", "Can you elaborate more on that - but this does more sound like youre excluding someone specifically", "Michelle said she thought OP was kidding and it was a misunderstanding. Im choosing to believe that she isn\u2019t lying to OP.\n\nI dont think they should have brought Sam and the gf for sure. But they did and is this really the hill OP wants to die on?", "Lily didn't invite him. She did nothing to deserve OP being nasty to her.", "Sam has not always been apart of our friend group- but has been at alot of events Michelle has hosted recently (birthday partys, halloween party etc.). He started working with Michelle and her boyfriend. So yes, he is closer to them and obviously close with his sister Lily. Yes lol, I was excluding him because of how he would literally not acknowledge me anymore and ignore me. I don't want to feel uncomfortable in my home", ">Michelle said she thought OP was kidding and it was a misunderstanding. Im choosing to believe that she isn\u2019t lying to OP.\n\nWhy? People don't joke about shit like this.", "That doesn't mean she shouldn't apologize though? She's the one that made the mistake.", "She brought him as well as Michelle. They all came together. Even if Michelle was the original one to invite him, Lilly was explicitly told that he was not to come and she allowed it anyways AND came with him. She disrespected her friend's wishes and showed no reguard for her feelings... and honestly it seems like it really was a plot between all 3 of them. At the very least she couldnhave removed herself from the situation or have given her friend a heads up by saying \"hey. i know you dont want my brother to come but im just letting you know that hes coming WITH his girlfriend.\" all 3 friends seem shady", "You're fine OP. He's rude to ignore you and ice you out but still show up at your house, and your friends were rude for not respecting you in this.", "Fair enough - sounds like you might inadvertently make people chose between you and Sam in the long run.", "She should. I said she was an AH.", "> she allowed it anyways\n\nWhat is she supposed to do? Physically restrain him? \n\n>AND came with him\n\nOP doesn't say who brought who, just that they all showed up together. But if Michelle picks up Lily and Sam is in the car, or picks up Lily and then says \"we're stopping at Sams\" what do you want her to do? Grab the wheel and crash the car? Physically fight Sam to keep him out? Lily isn't a bouncer and has no obligation to enforce OP's guest list. \n\nIf OP clarifies that Lily is the one who picked him up and brought him, I'll eat my words but at the moment OP has not stated who brought who.", "It is my understanding that they were all at Michelles house together and drove together (michelle's boyfriend drove)", "So then Lily really didn't have much she could do. It's not her job to enforce your guest list, and she had nothing to do with Sam coming. She didn't invite him, she didn't drive him. All she did was not ask him to leave, which you didn't do either.", "And then Lily stopped speaking to OP? How is OP taking out anything on her?", "Then, Lily should have walked in and immediately apologized to OP for him being there. She\u2019s just as culpable as Michelle and pitching her temper tantrum now doesn\u2019t change that.", "\"I was cold toward Lily\" says OP. Cold towards Lily for not acting as a bouncer for OP. Seems pretty unfriendly.", "I didn't expect anyone to act as a bouncer? But Lily was staying at her parents house where Sam also lives. I bet my life on it that they all had a conversation about it. A heads up text would have been nice. Literally any communication from my friends would have been better than just deciding to all show up lmao. I was cold, I was upset. But I didn't say anything rude or offensive, I just didn't socialize as much with her"]}
