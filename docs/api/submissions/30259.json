{"id": 30259, "submission_id": "17n86pq", "title": "AITA for telling my husband to back off about me getting more active?", "selftext": "Over the past couple of months, my (37F) husband (39M) has been losing weight. I'm really happy for him. He has high blood pressure and he's morbidly obese. I've been cooking healthier for the family as a whole and making sure he has salad ingredients every week for his lunches. \nI am also morbidly obese. I'm making healthier choices, vastly decreased my fast food and treat intake, and am making a conscious effort to take the kids outside more. \nWe live in a 3rd floor apartment and a week or two ago, he mentioned something while we were walking up about how I needed to get more exercise. I guess I wasn't walking up as fast as he wanted or he heard me breathing hard. Whatever. I agreed with him. \nA few days ago, we were discussing daily life and he asked what I do when I take the kids to the playground. I told him that I play with the kids a few minutes, sit on my phone a few minutes, walk around playing Pokemon Go, sit for a few more minutes, etc. He said I needed to start walking more. I just said, \"okay.\" Because it honestly rubbed me the wrong way. Like what I was doing wasn't enough. \nToday, him and I were at a local park and I was scrolling through FB videos and stopped on a video of a larger woman working out. It was a before/after type video. He looked over my shoulder and said, \"yeah, like that!\", pointing at the video. I'm responded, \"what?\" He said i could be doing that. \nI (calmly) told him that he needed to stop harping on me about my weight. I guess technically he's only harping on my exercise frequency. He said, \"I don't!\" I told him, \"yes. You have brought it up 3 or 4 times.\" My tone was conversational, but I truly did want him to stop. He started to say \"no I haven't\", but one of our kids ran up and I turned to the kid. Then he muttered under his breathe \"fuck this.\", got up and sat in the car. \nI honestly don't want to deal with this. I don't want to make a big deal about it, but I want his comments to stop.\n\nUPDATE: I was asking if ITAH for what I said.  So far, no one has said I'm the AH for that. Just that I'm the AH for existing in a fat body. I know I'm a fat fuck, but I want to know if I'm the AH for what I said. \n\nFor some context, I'm not at the highest weight I've ever been at. I've lost 50+lbs at least 4 times in my life. But it has ultimately always been unsustainable. Which is why I'm taking a \"slow but steady\" approach this time. I'll do what works for now and when that doesn't seem so arduous, I'll add something new.  The one time I lost a substantial amount of weight while living with my husband was between my two pregnancies. He was not losing weight at the time and would bring me desserts, sodas, etc after I'd ask him not to. We had to have a full out fight about it before he got the message that I don't want those things. Yes, I'll eat them, but I didn't buy them because I didn't want them in the house because I'll eat them! \n\nAlso, I'm autistic and communication is not my strong point. I tend to just be quietly annoyed until I blow up. So I thought I was doing well by calmly telling him that I don't appreciate the comments about my exercise level and I want them to stop. I understand now that there is no way for him to bring up these concerns that won't annoy me, and that's a me issue, but him. Also, I just made the connection between his comments and all the comments my mom would make when I was a kid and she wanted to push me to lose weight/ eat less/ not eat sweets/ exercise.

I'm fat and there is nothing more demotivating than other people judging you and telling you what to do about your lifestyle. You are making small sustainable changes and that's all that counts.

Let him know that encouragement is helpful and welcome, E.g. \"it's so great that you are taking the kids out more, let's do more of that together!\" But telling you what to do and then getting huffy about your dislike of being told what to do is actively discouraging and a hard boundary for you.", "NTA\n\nHe shouldn't be pushing you in this way or making snide comments under his breath towards you.

My husband (normal weight) had mentioned being worried about my health to me a couple times, but that was it. If he'd pushed me to immediately jump into his workouts I would never have lost the weight. I had to do things on my time. \n\nIf he was having a major health transformation and you were doing nothing at all, I could understand him pushing a bit more. But as long as you're making steady progress, which it sounds like you are, he should back off.

No 6 pack or anything, but he was not overweight at all.  I didn't expect him to work out but maybe play ball with his boys (my stepsons) in the gym or swim with them. The kids wanted him to go as well, they would even tell their dad every time a guy tried to speak to me to try to make him jealous so he would come. That just made him want me to stop going. Even though I always had one of our older children with me at all times. This isn't why we divorced; it was bc he was controlling.

Your resting metabolism is gonna use a lot more calories than your exercise takes up unless you are doing a serious regime, like one pro athletes do. Obese people have much higher resting metabolisms than skinnier people, so their weight loss is pretty much entirely based on diet. Obese people also use more energy to move around, very simplisticly work (aka energy expenditure) is force over distance and heavier people take more force to move around. A fat person burns more calories walking around than a skinny person, but burns much more calories simply by being alive.\n\nAttempting rigorous exercise while obese is not always a great idea. Joints are fragile things and losing weight won't fix a bum knee or a fucked back if you damage them in the process.\n\nLosing weight is largely about diet. You eat less calories until you start losing weight, then gradually decrease them more as your weight and resting metabolism decrease.

She she start making patronizing comments about how much he is doing?   \n\nShe already knows she is obese and that that\u2019s not great for her health.  She does not need him to remind her.  Human motivation doesn\u2019t work that way.  And she\u2019s already started making sustainable changes that will result in lasting improvements.", "Definitely disagree.  In every way.  But the fact that your first statement was about how he probably doesn\u2019t find her attractive anymore kind of makes the point that we are not going to agree.  \n\nIt\u2019s also fairly likely that they were both obese when they met.  \n\nBut if we\u2019re going to pretend this is a good faith discussion; she already knows she is obese and unhealthy.   He is barely more healthy because he\u2019s only been working on it for a minute.  She is supporting and facilitating his dietary improvements as well as for the whole family.  She herself has made significant dietary improvements and is gradually increasing her activity in a way that is far more likely to be sustainable than his first burst of exercise zealotism.  ie she does not need his input.", "Ooo, that's good shit.", "Omg,stfu dude.", "He\u2019s also morbidly obese, There both trying to lose weight what are you even on about, she\u2019s taking a steady pace as to not end up going back on her decision or relapse and binge eat, she\u2019s doing it her way", "Not saying this is about OP, but some people can't exercise and this is an insanely scaremonger-y comment.", "She is not doing nothing at all.  She\u2019s doing more than she was.  And as others have pointed out, diet is far more important than exercise in weight loss.   \n\nExercise when you are severely overweight is insanely difficult.   A good way to give up after a week is to approach it as \u2018must exercise so much, right now!\u2019   As you lose, exercise gets easier, and gradually increasing exercise as you are able is the key to sustainable weight loss and fitness.", "Stop blaming OP for having boundaries.", "Okay, but that's still not encouragment. Telling someone a hard truth is sometimes needed, but that doesn't make it encouraging.", "Are you ignoring the fact that the husband is also morbidly obese?", "He is not trying to look out for her. He\u2019s getting all cocky with his new body and acting like the ultimate weight loss authority", "My advice is not for her to do nothing. It is simply my belief that it\u2019s not my place to tell her to do anything with her weight. It\u2019s not my business. You say that I\u2019m harmful, but you\u2019re harmful to her mental and emotional health which contributes to her weight. So if you think you\u2019re doing her any good you\u2019re very much mistaken, and again it is definitely more about your moral high ground than any true concern for her.", "\ud83e\udd23 From you? That's a hard pass.", "On your home? You mean the roof?", "No, she's \"aware\" that she's feeling judged and unappreciated. I get that 100%. But there needs to be a way for him to express interest in a change in their lifestyle without being cold shouldered.", "Lol if you say so. I agree with OP that he's being insensitive. But yall can't seem to understand that not everything is done with malicious intent. I personally would want someone to tell me, respectfully and with love, that my habits need to change. \n\nAgreeing to disagree like I said.", "OP chose to get married. That inherently assumes she wants encouragement and concern comes with the territory.", "Uh, no? She asked us if she was the asshole, and I shared my opinion", "Considering she admits to sitting on her phone while her kids are at the park, I\u2019m betting she\u2019s lying. It\u2019s bad parenting to do that either way. She needs to do better all around", "In no way shape or form do I tell her not to have boundaries. In fact I tell her to establish them at the end, something she is unwilling to do as she hasn't explained anything about how she's feeling to her supposed partner \n\nHaving boundaries is important, creating boundaries without even telling your partner about them, reading into what they are saying into your own insecurities and then not explaining yourself are childish, as are you.", "In a different comment you were asked...\n\n>How would you prefer that he'd raised this with you?\n\nYour response:\n\n>I would prefer that he didn't. At all.\n\nTo me, it doesn't sound like you'd consider *anything* encouraging.", "They don't get it don't even try and explain it to them", "No?...", "Especially since he has a history of sabotaging you.   He doesn\u2019t get to suddenly be all health conscious for both of you like he never did that.   \n\nBesides, there is not a single overweight person I\u2019ve ever met that doesn\u2019t already know that they are overweight and that that\u2019s not great for their health.   People that act like *someone needs to tell you* are living in a delusion.", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t take advice from someone who read the OP and got \u2018doing nothing\u2019 from that.  \n\nNTA btw.   You calmly stated your boundaries, but unfortunately will probably need to do so again.  But making small sustainable changes is definitely the way (in my opinion) to go.", "Jesus the people in this thread.", "He\u2019s expressing that she needs to change her lifestyle. He\u2019s telling her to change HER behaviors. There\u2019s nowhere she mentions him expressing disappointment that she, say, can\u2019t keep up with an intense hike he wants to do, which would actually support your argument.", "Lol.  That is the dumbest statement I\u2019ve read all day, and I\u2019ve read this entire comment section.  \n\nGetting married does not assume that your spouse gets to make comments which they perceive to be helpful even when asked not to.  \n\nBut also, I asked what makes you think she would *benefit* from his comments, well meaning or otherwise?   Are you one of the multitude who think she doesn\u2019t already know she\u2019s obese and unhealthy?   Did you also fail to notice the very material changes she has already made?", "*SHE IS ALSO LOSING WEIGHT DUDE*", "She\u2019s still trying, she walks around then sits on her phone yk like a break because like she said morbidly obese going straight into walking for an hour or so when your that obese isn\u2019t smart plus she\u2019s starting to eat a lot healthier she\u2019s doing what she sees best and no one should judge someone if there literally tryibf", "On this particular subject, no, I wouldn't.", "Sorry, but I don\u2019t believe it. She sits on her phone while her kids play. What kind of parent does that?", "And that's your right. You are not the asshole here.", "She plays Pok\u00e9mon go too and also sits occasionally. Pok\u00e9mon go involves a lot of walking"]}
