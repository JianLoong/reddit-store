I'm fat and there is nothing more demotivating than other people judging you and telling you what to do about your lifestyle. You are making small sustainable changes and that's all that counts. For long term weight loss, slow and steady always wins the race. You need to wait a minute, cool off and then have a conversation with him about your boundaries and what is helpful and what is not. Let him know that encouragement is helpful and welcome, E.g. \"it's so great that you are taking the kids out more, let's do more of that together!\" But telling you what to do and then getting huffy about your dislike of being told what to do is actively discouraging and a hard boundary for you.", "NTA\n\nHe shouldn't be pushing you in this way or making snide comments under his breath towards you.

My husband (normal weight) had mentioned being worried about my health to me a couple times, but that was it.

He would stay home and play video games. I wanted him to come with me so much,  I wanted him to be more active with the kids and I as a family. He took it as me saying he was not fit BUT HE WAS.  No 6 pack or anything, but he was not overweight at all.  I didn't expect him to work out but maybe play ball with his boys (my stepsons) in the gym or swim with them. The kids wanted him to go as well, they would even tell their dad every time a guy tried to speak to me to try to make him jealous so he would come. That just made him want me to stop going. Even though I always had one of our older children with me at all times. This isn't why we divorced; it was bc he was controlling.

I just worry that this could worsen your relationship with food and cause a disorder (working out too much to burn off a bunch of calories is also part of a disorder).  It\u2019s not a competition. It\u2019s not about your husband.  It\u2019s about YOU and your health, physical and mental.
