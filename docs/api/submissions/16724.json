Kasey and Karly share a father who died when both were young and Jamie\u2019s father is no longer in the picture. During my breakup with Jamie\u2019s father, he got very abusive towards the kids when I didn\u2019t know about. I only found out when I found Kasey drunk and asked her why she was acting out because she\u2019s always been my \u201cgood\u201d kid.\n\nHe is out of the picture but Kasey took a lot of the abuse so her siblings wouldn\u2019t have to. Her brother and sister don\u2019t know about this, I feel horrible and am trying to be a better mother, going to therapy and doing whatever I can to help. \n\nThe abuse and bullying at school put Kasey in a bad mental spot. She ended up being hospitalized four times for trying to end things. She had been diagnosed with PTSD, severe anxiety and severe depression from both situations. She\u2019s doing better now, we talk openly, have medicine for her and she goes to therapy and she is doing so much better. I am extremely proud of her.\n\nRecently I have a friend who had gotten out of an abusive relationship. She has a son, Tom (19), and is very pregnant and asked if I could take them until she figured out what to do. I agreed after talking to everyone in the house. \n\nThe main problem is that Tom doesn\u2019t know how to respect boundaries, or at least doesn\u2019t try. Tom got bullied too so my friend thought he could talk to Kasey.\n\nLast night, I was in the kitchen and Kasey started having a panic attack. I was very confused because things been ok and she is usually good with her coping mechanisms. I got her into the shower and sat with. She explained to me that Tom was freaking her out, he kept getting too close to her and that she didn\u2019t like him sleeping downstairs because she doesn\u2019t have a lock on her door. (I know a lot of people disagree with this but it\u2019s a safety measure due to her past hospitalizations, it\u2019s not something that will be changing). Overall she told me she didn\u2019t feel safe and didn\u2019t want Tom living with us. \n\nI talked to my friend and told her about the situation. Friend said Tom wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong and basically kept making excuses for Tom, saying that Kasey probably wasn\u2019t clear but by the way she had a breakdown in the kitchen was more then obvious. I\u2019m not letting her get bad again because of someone, I failed protecting her once and I don\u2019t plan on doing it again. So I gave my friend an ultimatum, Tom can leave on his own or they can all leave. She said I was being an AH and that she was pregnant and that Kasey was just being dramatic. I told her to leave.\n\nAll day I have been getting texts from her where she is telling me I\u2019m a horrible person for throwing her to the streets. I gave her the location of the local woman\u2019s shelter and she got angry because they won\u2019t let Tom there, according to her. So I don\u2019t know, I just want others opinions.", "created_utc": 1683572375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c18u7/aita_for_telling_my_pregnant_friend_to_leave/", "score": 595, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
