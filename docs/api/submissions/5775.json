If you were my friend or family member and I noticed a problem I would invite you to a private room and help you figure out an elegant solution. You may be his daughter but you still deserve respect.

However, there is less info about the general dress and modesty code at this wedding. I know that in many places of the world covering up the chest area despite wearing a blouse is a very common part of the culture for adolescents and adults. I do feel that your dad or family needs to have explained this to you before in case they were not comfortable with it.", "NAH.It\u2019s not always about sexualising.Sometimes,it\u2019s also about adhering to cultural norms.A lot of girls will not cover up or they will just drape the dupatta around their arms which is really common.However,that differs from place to place and culture to culture.Your dad was probably trying to make sure you fit in and that you didn\u2019t get any odd stares\u2014and by that I don\u2019t just mean by the men.Either that,or your blouse really was stretched to the limits of its structural integrity and might have not looked too good.Ultimately,i just think your dad was looking out for you,OP.You should talk this through with him :)", "Yup, I am describing a lehenga. I was wearing it how it was supposed to be worn and there were many other girls there wearing a lehenga as well.", "It\u2019s creepy that you are assuming this father to be sexualizing his daughter rather than the equally possible option that he was prompting his child to adhere to cultural norms of the region they are visiting.\n\nIf I show up to a wedding in a Catholic Church with my midriff showing, or spaghetti straps, I\u2019m fully expecting my father to prompt me to cover up out of the respect for the venue we are in, and it has nothing to do with sexualizing me.", "My mom wasn't at the dining table at the time since she was busy with something. She doesn't know about this yet though. I might talk to her about this soon. Yes, I was wearing a bra and no nipples were showing.", "It was an Indian wedding and my sister and I were wearing lehengas like most of the other women there.", "Yes, other women were also wearing lehengas like my sister and I. But most of the women there were not wearing a duppata since it was hot outside.", "She was wearing the same outfit as others in the same way, she simply has bigger breasts. Why on earth would you compare that to showing midriff?", "Wore the same outfit as her sister. The only difference is op has boobs she wasn't wearing anything culturally inappropriate", "So why not tell the 11 year old to cover up too if that was the issue?\n\nKinda sus of him- and YOU- to want the 16 year old to cover up but an 11 year old in the same \"revealing\" outfit is fine and doesn't warrant the sane treatment.", "She's literally wearing the traditional clothing of the country they're in, just like everyone else at the wedding.", "She should help you with this, or another trusted relative. You don\u2019t deserve to be shamed about your body", "Thank you for clarifying. I vote NTA.", "NTA. I just looked up what a lehenga and duppata are - I am sure you looked beautiful!", "I don\u2019t think you were an AH, but is it possible that your dad was trying to protect you from creepy stares or comments? I think you should have conversation with your parents about why he expected you to be more covered up than other women.\n\nIt was not clear to me if you are  visiting home as a family or if you were outside the country and back visiting the country. My personal experience is that going back to India for visits after living in the US put me under SO MUCH scrutiny. People would rudely comment about everything about me, including my body\u2014especially after I hit puberty. My cousin (also fro the US) got it much worse since she is curvier than me. \n\nThese were comments from men and women. It\u2019s possible that your dad is trying to shield you from this sort of thing. Anyway, it\u2019s worth a conversation with your parents\u2014or at least your mom.", "I don\u2019t know how the garments fit on the 11 year old.  Perhaps since the younger child did not have breasts, the fabric came down longer and covered more.   \n\nTwo identical garments are going to look very different on two different body types.", "One of the biggest drawbacks of colonization was the over sexualization of peoples cultures. As a African it absolutely irks me that I am not even allowed to wear my traditional attire in its purest, rawest and  most weather appropriate form in my home country because even that\u2019s a tie it has been modified to suit British propriety, and the original has been deemed inappropriate.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nCan I ask if your father is of the same culture or if he married into yours? I am just wondering why he would make a fuss about his country's traditional attire if he was indian himself...but I can see a european/american man sexualizing a lehenga or find it revealing for the occasion (not an excuse for his behaviour btw!, far from it!).\n\nMaybe he saw some guys staring but then he should have told *them* to stop instead of telling you to cover up.", "NTA. At the risk of sounding xenophobic, your father is not behaving like Western men behave and his bit of \"old country\" is misogynistic, paternalistic, and off putting.", "OP has confirmed she was wearing a bra under her lehenga and it was appropriate; and that many other women were dressed the same. The issue is that dad freaked out that his daughter has breasts. NTA.", "May I ask what attire that is? It sounds interesting what it looks like and how it was changed.", "Not much you can do with Indian clothing and big boobs, it's inherently going to look more showy/more noticeable than smaller busted women.  Its absurd, but it's always going to happen to you at these traditional/back home events - maybe start wearing something more western thats a bit looser or a more flow-y lehenga? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou won't convince them to stop being nosy aunties/uncles, if going to these events is important to you and you don't want to deal with the comments you'll have to change your way of dressing - they sure as Fuck aren't going to change lmao.", "She was wearing a lehenga, the same as all of the other women at the wedding.

He wanted to control your appearance and was not respecting your bodily autonomy. He needs to take several large steps back and fix his head.", "Good point. My husband is Indian and he would never find traditional Indian attire sexualising at all. Indian men are used to seeing bared midriffs with saris etc. this is a strange one. OP is NTA and needs to tell her dad to stop judging all men by his own standards if that\u2019s what he\u2019s worried about.", "Apparently chest was covered and there wasn't cleavage", "What part of the West are you from? Because in my corner of the US, shaming women for having large breasts and/or wearing tight or revealing clothing is pretty common.", "That's stupid. The newer lehengas are deliberately cut tight to show off the body. No one has any issue with them except your dad. Tell him to grow up. What about the backless blouses so many women wear? That's been a thing for years!", "They were wearing *cultural* clothing. It's clearly the norm.", "I'm just curious. Was he getting a lot of rude comments from his relatives? Or was he getting questions about your availability from young men at the wedding? \n\nNTA but I'm guessing someone was making him VERY uncomfortable which is why he reacted the way he did. Please talk to your Mom about the situation or next time find an Auntie to help you deflect your Dad's attitude.", "Her dad was the only one that had an issue, no one else said anything.  She shouldn\u2019t have to dress differently because her dad is sexualizing her and was the only one uncomfortable.  Her clothing was appropriate.", "Why was this downvoted?\n\nSpeaking as a foreigner visiting India, I was escorted by my local friends entire family when we were in public and was told to wait in the car because the local men would straight up stare and her family wanted to decrease the potential for sexual assault. \n\nBest case scenario, OP\u2019s dad very awfully failed to attempt to shield OP from family judgement/ scrutiny/ perverts because traditional cultures (in my big chested experience) immediately slut shame and start justifying sexual assault for simply being born with a bigger chest. Worst case he is a pervert. \n\nOP please speak to your mom or some woke aunties. Again from personal experience, having big boobs was a no win because I was constantly slut shamed by my own family for existing. It took years of therapy to love my body  and my boobs as well as a few months of physiotherapy to straighten out my back from slouching to hide my chest.", "Holy Fuck get off your high horse, we both have the same opinion.  I'm just realistic on what OP's path forward should be b/c I'm from this ass backwards culture.  OP isn't going to change the opinions of the busybodies at these kinds of events, and I can assure you with that many older Indians in one place there was at least 5 nosy aunties gossiping about how \"loose\" OP must be.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf OP values continuing to attend these functions AND doesn't mind the comments then power to her, but if the comments bother her but she still wants to attend then she will have to be the one to change.  You aren't going to unwind the toxic gossipy modest culture that pervades the Indian community, this isn't some white mans version of a cultural reckoning lmao.", "NTA You should dress according to your style and the weather - Your dad shouldn't sexualize you!!!", "NTA he made you feel uncomfortable", "Your father is sexualizing you.  Absolutely disgusting and AH behavior.\n\nNTA", "Lmao wtf he was doing all this bc you were in a lehenga??? Weird asf. NTA at all! I'm sorry he behaved like that, EXTREMELY weird", "NTA.\n\nIf he was trying to shield your there are better ways than treating you in such a way. He should stand up for you and not put you down. If he was acting for his own comfort, then he's twice the AH he would be otherwise.\n\nI bet you were gorgeous, don't ever let them shame you!", "Totally NTA! Ask him to please stop sexualizing your body. I grew up with this kind of behavior from my parents as well. I have some serious body issues now - feeling like I'm too hideous to be seen. I'm working through it, but it's harder when you're older. Just trust that this is 100% HIS problem and has nothing to do with you (other than the fact that your his daughter and it's probably distressing for him to think of you growing up and becoming a woman. Again, his issue, not yours and don't let him make you feel bad).", "NTA. I'm assuming you were in a lehenga, which is pretty standard wedding wear. Covering your top in front of everyone was crossing a line, imo, especially given that no-one else was commenting on your clothing.", "NAH: I'm sure you were fine in your dress and looked amazing. Dads are often over protective of their daughters. By the sound of it you visited/from ?India?. Your dad could be worried about you being targeted while there, from locals perspective you are now a foreigner. Its not uncommon for men in certain countries to target women for assault. Indian weddings are huge from what I've been told, my guess there was at least 500+ (i wouldn't be surprised even at 1500) people at the wedding? Probably many of them weren't family members. Also depending on families there are some that are very very conservative in their thinking, especially older generations that practice conservative religions. Maybe he doesn't want other old family members saying/thinking anything negative about you and just went around it in a very bad way? I've definitely seen older ladies with their crazy/weird comments about younger generation clothes piss me off enough just permanently avoid them. \n\nI think you and your dad need to talk, ask him why he kept telling you to cover up when many other girls at the wedding were wearing the same clothes as you. Hopefully he will be able to give you a honest answer that then you can both talk about and reach a mutual understanding or compromise. To build a strong relationship with another human being you have to communicate your feelings and thoughts with them, even more important with blood relatives (since you are stuck with them forever).", "Jesus Christ those look prettier than anything worn at a western wedding.\n\nSeriously NTA though. You didn\u2019t show up to a funeral in a skimpy outfit, your attire matched the event.", "Point out that for centuries ago,  lehemgas and sarees didn\u2019t have tops at all.", "This really didn't seem to be the case, though. OP says it was a high necline outfit, there was no cleavage showing, and there were sleeves, so it doesn't seem like there was anything that could be covered up, so yes, it ia a bit creepy that dad was saying she needed to do that when nothing was showing.", "You sound like the biggest idiot", "I wish that I was comfortable enough with my body to wear a lehenga at 16.  I had just grown boobs and my clothes started to fit weird, but then I had teachers and my father starting to make me feel bad about my body, so I resorted to only wearing oversized hoodies and baggy jeans. \n\nYour body is perfect just the way it is. You wore an outfit appropriate to the occasion. Your father can fuck all the way off. Don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.", "Funny thought here, but maybe don't put the 16yo and the 11yo in the same outfit and expect it to fit the same way. I mean, seriously.", "Cause the creepy comments were coming from the dad.", "OP doesn't need to dress differently from the rest of her family to be respected. She is just as entitled to celebrate her culture and its traditional clothing as every other woman of her culture. \n\nAunties who gossip about someone's sex life based on nothing other than someone's body shape can be called out as the jealous AHs they are or ignored as annoyances OP thankfully only needs to tolerate for short spans of time when they actually occupy the same town. Eventually they will either die or come to see how foolish they've made themselves look. I assure you OP's cousins, male and female, have the internet and aren't stuck en masse in the 19th century any more than their Iranian peers are.", "Thats a nice opinion and all that, but it's not going to change the social views of a 50 something socially conservative man/woman.  I agree with your opinion, but it's not going to change the minds of those judgemental pricks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, if OP can ignore the comments and live with them, power to her - if not then she should be realistic about how likely it is to change the behavior of someone whose literally from another time period and another culture and adapt accordingly.", "So she's not a part of her own culture?", "Just because you\u2019ve had shitty experiences within your own culture doesn\u2019t mean you get to project them into everyone else. \n\nOP clearly said that the ONLY person who had an issue with her dad, you keep insisting that people are talking about her behind her back when there\u2019s zero evidence to back that up. This is an individual issue not a cultural issue. Believe it or not India is a huge ass country and not every family is like yours.", "She isn't going to change the older generations minds, idk what about that is so hard for you to understand.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she wants to attend and dress the way she is, she has to be able to deal with the comments or just aggressively call them out.  If thats not something she wants to do then she needs to either not attend or dress in something thats boxy and unflattering - or she can embark on some quest to change the opinions of some old people who will be dead in a few decades anyways.", "Yeah, she\u2019s choosing to aggressively call them out and we\u2019re judging her as not the asshole for doing so. The advice you\u2019re giving isn\u2019t relevant but it\u2019s certainly judgmental", "Because to me, it sounds like your argument is that for the sake of being left alone, she should give up a major piece of her cultural expression/identity to appease a bunch of slut shaming bullies. So you think that \"peace\" means being bullied out of her culture and potentially even her extended family?\n\n\"More boxy and loose fitting clothing.\" Like what, exactly? Clothing from other Indian cultures which aren't her own? A less formal sari? But those also often form fitting, even if the culturally appropriate drape for OP's culture covers more of the torso than a lehenga. So are you actually arguing for Western clothing? Should she should white-wash herself? In her own culture? In her own family?!?! How is that \"peaceful\"? It sounds really fucking traumatic for OP to me.\n\nBased on her post, where she stood up to her father, in public, for slut shaming her for wearing the same outfit as her sister, her mother, and likely her grandmother, I think OP is more than capable of taking on the aunties. She might not be the favorite cousin for the next few years, but she'll keep her cultural identity intact. She'll get to belong in a way she won't if she gives in and wears a maxi dress or a caftan or ethnic clothing that belongs to someone else while everyone else is rocking their lehengas. And she won't look underdressed as she might in a sari, depending on exactly which part of India she calls home.", "NTA I think maybe dad isn't ready for you to be 16. Many dads struggle with thus across all cultures.", "Ask your father why he is sexualising you next time he behaves in this inappropriate way. NTA but he certainly is.", "That isn't a risk, its a guarantee. Plenty of Western men are like this about clothing. Its a conservative trait that exists all over", "It\u2019s pretty common on Reddit for any comments suggesting that women and girls cover up to be downvoted. \n\nI agree that it\u2019s unfair that men leer and women are the ones who have to cover themselves up. However, I think it\u2019s unrealistic to tell a 16 year old that there will be no consequences to defying local norms. \n\nI also don\u2019t agree that a parent asking their child to dress more conservatively is automatically sexualizing them. It may be or it may be that the dad was noticing others\u2019 behavior.\n\nI guess others disagree with me."]}
