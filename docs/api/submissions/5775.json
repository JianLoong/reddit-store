You were wearing it how it was to be worn. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say about Dad.", "Nta, most wedding are with family too. Kinda creepy for him be sexualizing you.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to keep his hands to himself, and if he has a problem with your clothing he should discuss it with you and your mother, privately. He embarrassed you, publicly. \n\nWhat does she think? Were you wearing a bra, or were any features (nipples) showing? If she thinks it was inappropriate too, he might have a point but still handled it wrong. However it sounds like he\u2019s uncomfortable with your developing body. If what you were wearing was in line with everyone else and your mother approved, he needs to back off. Your mother should help you handle this, or another trusted female adult.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure if he was sexualizing you directly or if he was afraid you could get targeted because for example he knew other men. Anyways, he acted poorly, if there was an issue, he should discuss it with you, maybe with your mum or with people who gave younthe outfit. Making a spectacle with covering you with scarf, he made the situation more visible, which - contrary to his intentions - could make people focus on you even more and making it a topic.", "NTA- sometimes tight materials can be see through and require a bra and even then show too much. But even if that is the case he should not have dealt with it like that. He acted ashamed and weird rather than with respect.  If you were my friend or family member and I noticed a problem I would invite you to a private room and help you figure out an elegant solution. You may be his daughter but you still deserve respect. If he wants your future husband to respect you and treat you kindly he best start behaving that way himself so that you have a role model. His lack of respect for your feelings is a terrible example. Fathers are supposed to set the bar high.", "NTA. And I\u2019ll take it a step further and say \u201cgood for you\u201d. When your dad behaved like an idiot, you tried to stop it and when he didn\u2019t, you walked away. (Sometimes making a scene is okay, but at a wedding, the best thing to do is walk away.) I\u2019d call your dad an AH, but a part of me can\u2019t because he raised an amazing young woman.

I ask because you compared yourself to your little sister but you should be comparing to women given your age. I am from India originally and both women and girls might wear similar outfits but we women drape a scarf for more modesty.

NTA.", "Unpopular but I\u2019m going with NAH. I do agree that your dad did not handle it the best way, I don\u2019t know why he waited until arriving at the wedding to bring this up. However, there is less info about the general dress and modesty code at this wedding. I know that in many places of the world covering up the chest area despite wearing a blouse is a very common part of the culture for adolescents and adults. I do feel that your dad or family needs to have explained this to you before in case they were not comfortable with it.", "NAH.It\u2019s not always about sexualising.Sometimes,it\u2019s also about adhering to cultural norms.A lot of girls will not cover up or they will just drape the dupatta around their arms which is really common.However,that differs from place to place and culture to culture.Your dad was probably trying to make sure you fit in and that you didn\u2019t get any odd stares\u2014and by that I don\u2019t just mean by the men.Either that,or your blouse really was stretched to the limits of its structural integrity and might have not looked too good.Ultimately,i just think your dad was looking out for you,OP.You should talk this through with him :)", "Yup, I am describing a lehenga. I was wearing it how it was supposed to be worn and there were many other girls there wearing a lehenga as well.", "It\u2019s creepy that you are assuming this father to be sexualizing his daughter rather than the equally possible option that he was prompting his child to adhere to cultural norms of the region they are visiting.\n\nIf I show up to a wedding in a Catholic Church with my midriff showing, or spaghetti straps, I\u2019m fully expecting my father to prompt me to cover up out of the respect for the venue we are in, and it has nothing to do with sexualizing me.", "My mom wasn't at the dining table at the time since she was busy with something. She doesn't know about this yet though. I might talk to her about this soon. Yes, I was wearing a bra and no nipples were showing.", "It was an Indian wedding and my sister and I were wearing lehengas like most of the other women there.", "Yes, other women were also wearing lehengas like my sister and I. But most of the women there were not wearing a duppata since it was hot outside.", "She was wearing the same outfit as others in the same way, she simply has bigger breasts. Why on earth would you compare that to showing midriff?", "Wore the same outfit as her sister. The only difference is op has boobs she wasn't wearing anything culturally inappropriate", "So why not tell the 11 year old to cover up too if that was the issue?\n\nKinda sus of him- and YOU- to want the 16 year old to cover up but an 11 year old in the same \"revealing\" outfit is fine and doesn't warrant the sane treatment.", "She's literally wearing the traditional clothing of the country they're in, just like everyone else at the wedding.", "She should help you with this, or another trusted relative. You don\u2019t deserve to be shamed about your body", "Thank you for clarifying. I vote NTA.", "NTA. I just looked up what a lehenga and duppata are - I am sure you looked beautiful!", "I don\u2019t think you were an AH, but is it possible that your dad was trying to protect you from creepy stares or comments? I think you should have conversation with your parents about why he expected you to be more covered up than other women.\n\nIt was not clear to me if you are  visiting home as a family or if you were outside the country and back visiting the country. My personal experience is that going back to India for visits after living in the US put me under SO MUCH scrutiny. People would rudely comment about everything about me, including my body\u2014especially after I hit puberty. My cousin (also fro the US) got it much worse since she is curvier than me. \n\nThese were comments from men and women. It\u2019s possible that your dad is trying to shield you from this sort of thing. Anyway, it\u2019s worth a conversation with your parents\u2014or at least your mom.", "I don\u2019t know how the garments fit on the 11 year old.  Perhaps since the younger child did not have breasts, the fabric came down longer and covered more.   \n\nTwo identical garments are going to look very different on two different body types.", "One of the biggest drawbacks of colonization was the over sexualization of peoples cultures. As a African it absolutely irks me that I am not even allowed to wear my traditional attire in its purest, rawest and  most weather appropriate form in my home country because even that\u2019s a tie it has been modified to suit British propriety, and the original has been deemed inappropriate.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nCan I ask if your father is of the same culture or if he married into yours? I am just wondering why he would make a fuss about his country's traditional attire if he was indian himself...but I can see a european/american man sexualizing a lehenga or find it revealing for the occasion (not an excuse for his behaviour btw!, far from it!).\n\nMaybe he saw some guys staring but then he should have told *them* to stop instead of telling you to cover up.", "NTA. At the risk of sounding xenophobic, your father is not behaving like Western men behave and his bit of \"old country\" is misogynistic, paternalistic, and off putting.", "OP has confirmed she was wearing a bra under her lehenga and it was appropriate; and that many other women were dressed the same. The issue is that dad freaked out that his daughter has breasts. NTA.", "May I ask what attire that is? It sounds interesting what it looks like and how it was changed.", "Not much you can do with Indian clothing and big boobs, it's inherently going to look more showy/more noticeable than smaller busted women.  Its absurd, but it's always going to happen to you at these traditional/back home events - maybe start wearing something more western thats a bit looser or a more flow-y lehenga? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou won't convince them to stop being nosy aunties/uncles, if going to these events is important to you and you don't want to deal with the comments you'll have to change your way of dressing - they sure as Fuck aren't going to change lmao.", "She was wearing a lehenga, the same as all of the other women at the wedding. She was appropriately dressed. \n\nHer father was sexualizing his own daughter and embarrassed himself by slut shaming her for no reason other than his 16 year old now has breasts, something not out of the ordinary at that age.\n\nOP you are NTA, however your father seems pretty creepy.", "Someone once told me they ignore everything except the first sentence.", "...and that's not sexualizing said bodies?", "OP are you in a major metro or smaller city or town ? I would assume in a metro no one will care but in small conservative towns people may? \n\nIs your dad normally very conservative about clothing ? Your mom ? \n\nYour NTA btw.", "NTA. Your dad is perhaps understandably uncomfortable with your body, but that\u2019s his problem, not yours.", "NTA. Dad has a few issues\u2026.", "NTA -- Your dad was being sexualizing you. He wanted to control your appearance and was not respecting your bodily autonomy. He needs to take several large steps back and fix his head.", "Good point. My husband is Indian and he would never find traditional Indian attire sexualising at all. Indian men are used to seeing bared midriffs with saris etc. this is a strange one. OP is NTA and needs to tell her dad to stop judging all men by his own standards if that\u2019s what he\u2019s worried about.", "Apparently chest was covered and there wasn't cleavage", "What part of the West are you from? Because in my corner of the US, shaming women for having large breasts and/or wearing tight or revealing clothing is pretty common.", "That's stupid. The newer lehengas are deliberately cut tight to show off the body. No one has any issue with them except your dad. Tell him to grow up. What about the backless blouses so many women wear? That's been a thing for years!", "They were wearing *cultural* clothing. It's clearly the norm.", "I'm just curious. Was he getting a lot of rude comments from his relatives? Or was he getting questions about your availability from young men at the wedding? \n\nNTA but I'm guessing someone was making him VERY uncomfortable which is why he reacted the way he did. Please talk to your Mom about the situation or next time find an Auntie to help you deflect your Dad's attitude.", "Her dad was the only one that had an issue, no one else said anything.  She shouldn\u2019t have to dress differently because her dad is sexualizing her and was the only one uncomfortable.  Her clothing was appropriate.", "Why was this downvoted?\n\nSpeaking as a foreigner visiting India, I was escorted by my local friends entire family when we were in public and was told to wait in the car because the local men would straight up stare and her family wanted to decrease the potential for sexual assault. \n\nBest case scenario, OP\u2019s dad very awfully failed to attempt to shield OP from family judgement/ scrutiny/ perverts because traditional cultures (in my big chested experience) immediately slut shame and start justifying sexual assault for simply being born with a bigger chest. Worst case he is a pervert. \n\nOP please speak to your mom or some woke aunties. Again from personal experience, having big boobs was a no win because I was constantly slut shamed by my own family for existing. It took years of therapy to love my body  and my boobs as well as a few months of physiotherapy to straighten out my back from slouching to hide my chest.", "Holy Fuck get off your high horse, we both have the same opinion.  I'm just realistic on what OP's path forward should be b/c I'm from this ass backwards culture.  OP isn't going to change the opinions of the busybodies at these kinds of events, and I can assure you with that many older Indians in one place there was at least 5 nosy aunties gossiping about how \"loose\" OP must be.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf OP values continuing to attend these functions AND doesn't mind the comments then power to her, but if the comments bother her but she still wants to attend then she will have to be the one to change.  You aren't going to unwind the toxic gossipy modest culture that pervades the Indian community, this isn't some white mans version of a cultural reckoning lmao."]}
