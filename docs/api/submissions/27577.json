Your family seems very self-conscious if they interpreted this as you judging their eating habits.\n\nAlso why do brother and SIL get to pick all the restaurants?", "NTA. \"Not everything is about you. It has nothing to do with your weight and everything to do with your choice of restaurant. I want a change.\"", "NTA. Yeah, all of the unhealthy food is tasty sometimes, but eesh not lunch and dinner every day. No wonder you're feeling icky and  I don't blame you for wanting a break from that.", "NTA. I love trash food - Taco Bell, McDonald\u2019s etc - BUT, my daughter (almost 12) and I have a deal - we don\u2019t eat it more than twice a week because yeah, it\u2019s junk. She has late-ish swim class twice a week, and those are our fun/junky food days. \n\nYou maybe should have suggested alternatives before just saying that you weren\u2019t eating junk that night, but even if you didn\u2019t, still NTA.\n\nThat said, is \u201cdonner kebabs\u201d a typo? Because given the story of the Donner Party, I admit that one made me blink a few times.", "NTA eat what you want. They need to mind their own business. Obviously they\u2019re feeling insecure bc you want to treat your body good and feel good. Just do you.", "NTA you made them feel guilty about the food choices they were making so they lashed out at you instead of facing reality. This is total projection.", "NTA  Honestly, if I do nothing but eat fast food, my face breaks out, I have bathroom issues, and I feel horrible and greasy.", "NTA. I will never understand why adults feel like they must be joined at the hip on vacation. However, in the future I would not talk about trash/junk food (true but judgmental) instead I would just announce my own intentions (i.e. I will be eating dinner/lunch/breakfast at xyz places) and leave it there.", "NTA and it doesn't sound like they are trying to lose weight particularly hard!  Let me guess, \"It's their vacation, they'll get to dieting when they get home.\"\n\nGo eat a salad in peace.", "NTA, you didn't say anything about their weight. It seems like they are projecting that. You definitely can eat the food of your choice.", "NTA. What you eat is nobody's business.", "NTA - I read your post but it wasn\u2019t necessary - your headline covers the key point.  You know this but a trip to the grocery store is necessary.", "NTA\n\nI entirely understand getting tired of constantly eating fast food. Nothing wrong with wanting something different.", "Absolutely NTA\u2026 but they\u2019d have a case for an NAH vote if you expressed your desire for healthier food in a certain way.", "NTA\n\nYou should be able to eat what you want. And you not wanting to eat the same trash as them doesn't make you fatphobic. \n\nI don't understand why people aren't taking turns with who gets to choose the restaurant. I think only letting them decide is enabling their shitty eating behavior. And trying to coddle their feelings in a weird way. It is everyone's vacation they should have a say on the restaurant.", "NTA. They seem like they know what they are doing is unhealthy and are taking it out on you. What jerks.", "NTA.  This is like a pack of alcoholics getting mad when someone declines the 10th cocktail", "NTA\nEven fast food salads are full of sugar high calories", "very light YTA if you used the word \"junk\" \"trash\" or \"crap\" in saying you wanted to eat something different.  Of course they're going to feel judged if you talk about their choices like that. NTA if you were more diplomatic with them then you where when venting here and they still got upset.", "YTA for how you said it. It came off as you judging them. You could have asked to eat at a specific location (maybe 3 options) where you could have given them options. Instead you told them you weren\u2019t eating junk today.", "NTA, I would have shamed them for their poor choices and not felt guilty at all.", "Lets be honest, there are plenty of options that have trash food and good food. You could have offered to go to a place like that and chose to get something healthy. You and I both know the way you worded it and went about it, wasnt like how you posted here. But guess what, that is 100% ok. If anything you should have a talk to them about their and let them know you dont want to gain and become unhealthy. No you arent an AH, but yes you did knowingly hurt their feelings. If you cant talk to them and tell them they are fat, who can?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they took offense to that, it's their problem. You didn't attack anyone.", "NTA. \n\nIn the future, I'd just avoid words like Junk, since it seems to hurt them. Just keep pushing that  'xyz doesn't sound good'. And I'd phrase the eating differently more on the 'You guys do that, I'm really craving xyz so I'm going to get that.' Its more effort for you, but honestly in cases like this, its the only real solution. Because they hurt they feel from hearing you say 'im not eating junk today' is internalized, and that takes a lot more than a couple family conversations to get past. Much easier for you to phrase it as cravings, and that something else doesn't sound good.", "NTA\n\nSome people are highly sensitive to how simple carbohydrates make them feel. I am one of those people. Give me a protein, veg and small side of a complex carb any day over a huge burger and a pile of fries. I could NOT live on that on vacation or otherwise and it has nothing to do with shaming anyone. It has everything to understanding how MY individual body handles foods and that those foods make me feel not good to the point that I need to sleep for an hour plus after eating.", "NTA its literally making you sick. Ever since getting my gallbladder out I have to be SO careful what I eat healthy or not. Even still its a choice.", "I would always eat separate if their food choices don't work for me.
