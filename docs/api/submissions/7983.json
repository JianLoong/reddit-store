Not using real names but, My (Fred, 34 male) gf, we will call her Maranda,(33 female) in my opinion overreacts to pain. She stubs her toe a lot and is always saying how it hurts, she doesn't ask for help when it happens it just annoys me because she's clumsy and could just watch where she's going. Anyways we were outside one night and I have this makeshift step that is pretty flimsy it's a piece of firewood that's there until I can get something better. Maranda used it and it rolled and it caused her to sprain her ankle. She fell to the ground and said it really hurt and it looked like she was about to cry. I told her she would be fine and even when she crawled past me to get inside I did not help because I felt like she was over exaggerating the pain. Well the next day I really looked at it and I do admit it's bad. She can't put any pressure on it. She told me it was really mean that I didn't believe her or help her in the moment and she left to go to her parents house and hasn't been back since, saying she needs time to think. Now her parents are mad at me and our friends also think I'm the ah, but I just don't see it that way. My sister told me to post on here to see what others would say. So reddit AITA?\n\nI might be the AH because I didn't help her when she fell, but keep in mind she overreacts to pain so in the moment I really didn't think she needed my help.", "created_utc": 1674394577, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ijtu6/aitah_for_not_helping_my_girlfriend_when_she/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're a 34 year old man who didn't help their significant other up off the ground when they were hurt. Don't assume to know someone else's pain threshold. Just because you can take pain or deal with it more than others, doesn't mean other people should have the same tolerances.\n\nNot only this, you've admittedly left a potential hazard for anyone to step on and injure themselves, not until you can manage something better, but until you're not lazy enough to fix it. So now you're moving blame from yourself onto your poor girlfriend and making her out to be the problem. The appropriate feeling to have here is guilt, not resentment.\n\nHer parents and your friends are correct, you are the asshole. This isn't something you do to people you love, I pray to whatever high power there is that she doesn't have kids with you, you'd be a miserable father figure.\n\nDo any of these sound like you OP? \"She dropped her plate of food, I was so annoyed with her so I didn't help her clean it. She should be more careful.\" \"She should have watched where her head was when standing up, that's why she hit her head, idiot\" \"The only reason she sprained her ankle is because she's clumsy, I can't be blamed for this\".\n\nThat shit above is not normal thinking or behavior. It sounds like you hate your girlfriend and actively hope these things harm her as if to provide some kind of cosmic justice for her lack of spatial awareness. You should actively do things to help prevent accidents. If my wife kneeled under a counter, I would gently guide her up or put my hand under the counter *just in case* she hit herself. It's an accident, not a punishment for forgetting where you are.\n\n**You would want to be helped or forgiven if you messed up, because you did not intend for it to happen.**", "YTA.  The good news though is that she realized what you\u2019re all about and left.", "YTA. Why are you even with her? You sound like you don't even like her.", "YTA. \n\nIf she has a low pain tolerance, then she still feels that pain that strongly. How you feel pain and how that compares to her does not matter, people feel pain differently. \n\nShe felt pain and could not walk because of that pain. Even if you think that she is not seriously injured, her pain is still real so she definitely needed help.", "So even by your own admission when she regularly \"overreacts to pain\" she doesn't ask for help. This time she did ask for help and you were annoyed and refused to help her? YTA massively and I hope she says at her parents permanently.", "YTA. \n\n>She fell to the ground and said it really hurt and it looked like she was about to cry. I told her she would be fine and even when she crawled past me to get inside I did not help because I felt like she was over exaggerating the pain.\n\nMan, you even said she looked like she was about to cry. You couldn't take a minute or two to atleast help her and see how bad the injury was? Yeah, you're TA. No wonder she left to her parents house.", "YTA.\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you dude?\n\nI've broken bones all up and down my body but a torn ankle ligament is the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life and it also took the longest time to heal.\n\nYeah, you're an asshole. Again, what the fuck is wrong with you?", "you sound MEAN \n\nYTA", "YTA to your (hopefully) Ex-girlfriend", "YTA. From everything you\u2019ve described, it sounds like she has a totally normal reaction to pain? Stubbing your toe does really hurt, it\u2019s completely normal that people react, it\u2019s so basic it feels insane to have to explain that. \n\nI\u2019m also wondering if she\u2019s actually clumsy or if your house is cluttered or poorly laid out. \n\nBut regardless, you let her crawl on the ground nearly in tears?? What!! Either deeply apologize to this woman and vow to grow some empathy, or leave her alone. If I were her I would be deeply concerned about what would happen if I fell ill or had a more serious accident, you would not be a trustworthy supportive partner.", "YTA man. You decided that she \"over reacts to pain\" even tho you have no way of knowing how she's actually feeling and then let her crawl inside without helping her. In the future don't tell others how they feel, just listen when they tell you.", "You might be the AH no honey. Full blown YTA. \n\nDo you even like your girlfriend? who sees there girlfriend lying on the ground in pain with literally TEARS IN THERE EYES and tells them to get over it.\n\nJesus Christ buy her flowers and a HUGE chocolate bar and treat her like a god damn princess for the next couple of days.", ">She fell to the ground and said it really hurt and it looked like she was about to cry. I told her she would be fine and even when she crawled past me to get inside I did not help because I felt like she was over exaggerating the pain. \n\nSo even though you saw her fall because of your makeshift step, she looked ready to cry and literally was crawling past you to try and get in the house, you didn't think to go help her up, offer her a hand inside, get some ice...nothing?  YTA\n\nAnd by the way, as someone who regularly stubs their toes, I can confirm it does hurt. Especially when you manage to break said toes when you stub them. But even that doesn't mean you need help when you do it. And it doesn't mean you are a weakling who \"needs to toughen up\". Vocalising pain can actually help the pain subside. As for her being clumsy, sometimes people can't help.", "You know what finally ended my marriage after 15 years?\n\nMy ex, who was always shitty like you about my \u201cclumsiness,\u201d was horrifically mean about my hurt ankle and when it turned out to be fractured and need an X-ray, refused to drive me.

U saying that ur girlfriend \u201coverreacts\u201dto pain is a big no no. This is why hundreds of girls esp of color get turned away by doctors or symptoms of serious alignments go unnoticed Bc they are told they are \u201cover reactin\u201d and their pain is not taken serious. We have periods dude we take that pain and most of us deal with it insilence. So why would u not believe her falling on the floor and hurting? Huge ah and if I was ur girlfriend I would start to resent u for it. She deserves someone more sensitive and receptive to her", "YTA she overreacts in your OPINION! you don't feel her pain you don't know and its not up to YOU to decide how much pain SHE is in! How is saying ow that hurts an overreaction. You will never believe her. Not everything is about you or what you think. Get over yourself. Apologise then leave her alone coz an attitude like yours could lead to her having a even more serious injury and not receiving help. I suggest not being in any relationship till you let go this attitude of you get the final say on other peoples lives.", "You don't care about her pain and find her annoying. Now she's gone. Sounds like it worked out for both of you.\n\nYTA. Why do you expect everyone in the world to be the same as you in situations? Try looking beyond the end of your own nose.", "YTA\n\nI hope you both break up. Some people are prone to accidents and feel pain a bit more no matter how much they try otherwise. As a partner you take care of them and vice verse", "YTA. Keep in my mind that not everyone has the same level of pain tolerance, the sprained ankle may be tolerable for you but for her it's too much and you're insensitive.", "YTA - i hope now that your ex gf, her family, all of your friends, sounds like maybe your family too, AND reddit have now told you YTA, you\u2019ll realize you really are one and make a change", "YTA - it sounds like you grew up being told to not respond when things hurt, to toughen up! I\u2019m sorry you went through that. Other people have been allowed to express themselves and when they feel pain they share that and expect people around them to empathise. You don\u2019t get to decide how someone else feels. She hurt herself, you offered no support. She left. She probably has a boundary that if people can\u2019t emotionally support her she reviews her situation and decides if she wants them in her life. The learning here needs to be on you and how you respond to other people\u2019s pain, not my girlfriend needs to learn how to respond to pain better. Therapy may be good for you.", "YTA. Your minimizing her pain is not only callous and showing a Serious lack of empathy in your invalidation of her, it's also potentially very dangerous.\n\nI gotta story for you: Last fall I got sick, was increasingly fatigued, felt weighed down, lost appetite to where I couldn't eat my favorite pizza. Then I had Excruciating stomach pain that kept both of us up all night, because I was moaning uncontrollably. Although comforting at first, his sleep deprived brain thought I would get past it as I'd always done, as I relied on my own medical care for years. Yeah well the pain got So great that when my bestie with Impeccable timing showed up, I desperately asked if she'd take me to the hospital, so she did.\n\nIt was the Last, Possible, Second for me before realizing it was out of my hands. The intake technician did my vitals 3x because they were volatile, and the ER nurse brought me fucking Fentanyl, actually avoiding my gaze and appearing to be upset. My husband got to my bedside right before the doctors came back to tell me about my CT scan results, and you know what it was? \n\nPerforated Appendicitis. They were not confident that I would make it, but that fentanyl numbed all physical and emotional pain - they told me it was too dangerous for surgery and that I could die, and I did not care. THAT is the power of fentanyl, which has No business being on the streets. Anyway, I was hospitalized for a week and a half and forced to live with JP drains for Two Months before they thought surgery was even an option, with a weekly at-home nurse to check on me.\n\nI found out later that had I not gone in when I did, I probably had about two hours left to live. October 6, 1989 - September 9, 2022. I had to be the strong one at times I wanted reassurance, but I survived one of the most horrendous experiences a person can go through. You can't prevent appendicitis. You can't predict it. You can't treat it at home. You probably won't even recognize it if it decides to pay you a visit. By the time you run to the hospital, it might be too late.\n\nMy husband was absolutely wracked with guilt. He has not only apologized profusely, his remorse and re-evaluation of how he views and does things are evident through his actions. He tells me he loves me every day and I know he means it. His resulting overprotection was overbearing at times, but it was approved by my doctor and my mother so I had to shut up and deal with it. He was genuinely scared out of his mind after he almost lost me, and has turned it around, Big Time.\n\nI hope this Never happens to you, OP. You need to figure out the root of your contempt for her before it destroys everything you have. Life is fragile. If you don't start appreciating her, either something catastrophic will happen, or she will get tired of it and find somebody else who will.\n\nP.S. I'm a natural klutz myself, and can't see the big E on doctors charts without corrective lenses. Astigmatism throws off my depth perception. Maybe she is clumsy because she can't see, which is through no fault of her own.", "YTA\n\nYou made a mistake & didn\u2019t help her... you\u2019re not a doctor & people do make mistakes so that\u2019s one thing ..... but then you realize she is in fact truly hurt & you want to double down to say \u201cya but it\u2019s her fault\u201d that I didn\u2019t help her because she overacts to pain. That\u2019s an AH move. Apologize, profusely, sincerely... your gf is hurt. This isn\u2019t a suck up buttercup situation. She sprained her ankle ... you should feel like shit now for not helping her. You were wrong. Own it!", "Yta your girlfriend tripped on a in your words \"Flimsy\" stair and you couldn't be bothered to help her when she fell. \n\nYou not helping her caused her more pain then the ankle, you can't be depended on when she's hurt.", "YTA. Pro-tip I get 'clumsy' and 'overreact to pain' the more my chronic illness flares up. She very likely has an undiagnosed one that is causing life to be a lot more difficult for her and rather than help her with that you're *using it as an excuse to be a dick towards her*. Fucking help her out more. She is routinely pushing herself past her limits for you, and for societal expectations.", "Stubbing your toe no matter how many times it happens hurts, it doesn't change how it hurts and even the most locational aware person can still be clumsy. \n\nShe fell because of your wonky step, she could have broken her ankle and you thought oh she's overreacting to it so I'll just stand here and twiddle my thumbs as she crawls past me in pain.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nI hope you leave her alone so she can move on from the horrific dipshit that is you.", "YTA\n\nWho cares if she \u201coverreacts\u201d to pain? You WATCHED her take a nasty fall on steps, and not only dismissed her feelings, but REFUSED to help after she CRAWLED back inside.\n\nDo you even like this woman? \n\nNot to mention, it\u2019s pretty idiotic to use something capable of rolling as a makeshift step.

YTA", "I've had a tooth pulled with zero anaesthetic. I've got PCOS, Endometriosis and once had my kidneys shut down because I mistook a raging kidney infection (famously painful) for everyday period pain. Gallbladder attacks were about a five for me on the pain scale. I had shingles and breezed through it. \n\nI once badly sprained my ankle and it is still, to this day, the worst pain I've ever experienced. Easily. I was literally clawing the ground and begging for help. \n\nMy point is everyone experiences pain differently. You can't assess how bad someone's pain is based on how *you* experience it. It isn't the same.\n\nAlso, does it matter? Who cares if she says stubbing her toe hurts? (I don't know anyone who says stubbing their toe doesn't hurt, btw). You had two options to weigh here. Option one, she isn't quite as hurt as she says she is, and you help her when she doesn't 100% need it. Option two, your girlfriend is in hideous pain and you *let her crawl past you into the house when she needs you*. Why would you not take option one every time? Why don't you *want* to help her, just to make her life easier? \n\nRight now, she's thinking a few things. First, YTA. You let her CRAWL rather than help her. Two, you don't take her seriously. You think you know her body better than she does.

Sounds like you were raised without any sympathy to you when you were in pain. I understand you strugle with hearing others be able to expres theirs.

First you had a dangerous and flimsy step that at least indirectly caused the problem.

She can't go through any major (or even minor!) illnesses and expect your support, because you obviously aren't going to give it.

No doubt about it. You saw her injure herself and decided to do nothing to teach her a lesson on how you expect your women to react to pain. Well done.", "YTA\u2014everyone\u2019s pain tolerance is different. So, let\u2019s kick you in the balls and see how YOU react to the pain.", "YTA stubbing your toe really hurts.

You don\u2019t get to dictate her pain; it\u2019s HER PAIN, not yours. \n\nI sprained my ankle right before Christmas. You know what my boyfriend did? Took care of me for 3 weeks! Helped me in and out of the shower, walked our dogs alone, cooked our meals, kept the ice packs cold. If you aren\u2019t supportive of her feelings in this situation, why should she trust you to get her through a pregnancy? A surgery? The emotional trauma of losing a parent? You sound like an awful person.", "YTA both for deciding to create a fall hazard instead of actually fixing your step and for not helping her when she was injured by the hazard you created.", "YTA. Big time. People respond to pain differently. Not everyone has the same threshold. And some people are more accident prone for one reason or another.\nHOWEVER, you knew the step was faulty and, that I'm aware of, didn't warn her whatsoever. Even if you did warn her, the common courtesy thing to do is help someone that sprained their ankle.\n\nHell, I've screamed on more than one occasion over a sprained ankle. One occasion was so bad that we thought my ankle might be broken. X-rays showed no breaks, but I wore a medical boot and used crutches for a week. I kept my foot elevated as much as I could for the first 3 days, because anytime my foot was below my heart, it throbbed like a mf.\n\nAlso, stubbing toes can lead to bone breaks. It's more common than people think. In our first place together, fiance would stub his toes daily because the place was too small and cramped. Sometimes his toes would bleed.\nBeing a GOOD SO means supporting each other at. all. times. Fiance doesn't always mention his back hurting, but I know it always does. How do I support him? Hugging often leads me to give his back a 5 minute massage to help him feel better. He always gets more relaxed and is grateful I'm looking out for him.\nI hurt my hip a couple days ago. Not sure exactly how. Last night it was very painful and bothersome, but we were working on chores. He reminded me to take plenty of breaks, and he did much of the \"heavy lifting\" to ease my pain.\n\nSuppose you suffer a painful and/or serious injury, would you want her to tell you to toughen up, or would you hope she helps you recover?\nHealthy SOs treat each other like they're worth taking care of.\nUnhealthy SOs treat each other like they're a bother at best and an enemy at worst. You're behaving like the latter, OP.", "YTA you responded in the most cruel and uncaring way possible. You have NO WAY of knowing if she\u2019s overreacting, because you cannot feel what she\u2019s feeling. You have literally no way of knowing, so you\u2019re just assuming she\u2019s doing it on purpose- to what? What would she get out of \u201coverreacting\u201d when you admit she doesn\u2019t normally ask for help? \nHopefully this is the incident that makes her realize she deserves someone who at least trusts her to know when she\u2019s in pain or not.", "YTA. That\u2019s exactly how a fall causing a fracture caused me to fall for a second time because my A of them-wife was laughing and refusing to help me up. So I fell again and instead of a simple broken ankle because of her laziness to glue the tiles properly to save \u20ac200 instead of calling someone to do them properly, I have to use a cane for life. \n\nI hope she sues you for every day she misses work, for causing her distress, for physiotherapy and every other medical expense.

She is, because it\u2019s her body. \n\nFYI, she should sue you for failing to maintain a decent walkway because spraining her ankle can be a lifelong problem.  It could cost her a lot in the long run.\n\nPersonally I think you should hope that she never comes back because it\u2019s clear you aren\u2019t qualified to be a good partner and aren\u2019t prepared to take on the liabilities of being such.", "YTA x100.

Not using real names but, My (Fred, 34 male) gf, we will call her Maranda,(33 female) in my opinion overreacts to pain. She stubs her toe a lot and is always saying how it hurts, she doesn't ask for help when it happens it just annoys me because she's clumsy and could just watch where she's going. Anyways we were outside one night and I have this makeshift step that is pretty flimsy it's a piece of firewood that's there until I can get something better. Maranda used it and it rolled and it caused her to sprain her ankle. She fell to the ground and said it really hurt and it looked like she was about to cry. I told her she would be fine and even when she crawled past me to get inside I did not help because I felt like she was over exaggerating the pain. Well the next day I really looked at it and I do admit it's bad. She can't put any pressure on it. She told me it was really mean that I didn't believe her or help her in the moment and she left to go to her parents house and hasn't been back since, saying she needs time to think. Now her parents are mad at me and our friends also think I'm the ah, but I just don't see it that way. My sister told me to post on here to see what others would say. So reddit AITA?\n\nI might be the AH because I didn't help her when she fell, but keep in mind she overreacts to pain so in the moment I really didn't think she needed my help.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What does she have to do to prove to you she\u2019s actually hurt? Die? \n\nWhat exactly is your rationale for thinking what you did wasn\u2019t wrong? Is it because she is clumsy and hurts herself?

Putting weight on a sprained ankle is the worst thing you can do.  Worst case scenario is she tore a ligament and will have to have surgery.  Best case is it is a minor sprain, but she will *do it again* because sprains don't fully heal and will eventually need surgery to repair the ligaments (speaking from personal experience.

We had a big family weekend vacation planned, taking the kids to Six Flags and a renaissance fair. We did the whole thing and I just toughed it out, taking the kids on rides, and even doing half the driving even though it was excruciating because my husband was pouty about having to do all of it.\n\nI didn\u2019t seek medical treatment for five days. When I did, it took them five weeks to finally x-ray my arm, then another two weeks to do the MRI. The arm broke right where the rotator cuff attaches to the top of the arm bone, and six tendons had mild to moderate tearing. \n\nIt\u2019s been seven months, my physical therapists tell me I\u2019m killing it in PT making crazy progress (because I push through the pain every single day consistently to get the exercises done), and my doctor says it\u2019s probably going to be at least two years before I\u2019m back to normal. I\u2019d have had a better outcome if I\u2019d just gone to the ER immediately.

Instead of the ligament tearing, the bone broke a chip off right at the spot where the ligament attaches to it.  My doctor said *you got so lucky*.
