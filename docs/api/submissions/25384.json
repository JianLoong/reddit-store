We women have to nip that shit in the bud!!", "Sure except it is primarily men who don\u2019t think to do this stuff. \u201cNot all men.\u201d Yes I agree. Not all men, but most of the time the caregiving and housekeeping still does fall on women and acting like it doesn\u2019t is you wanting to live in a fantasy land. \n\nMy husband who loves our dogs to death does not notice when their food/water bowls are empty. He only fills the water after he has taken them on a walk or when I tell him to. That doesn\u2019t make him a bad person, oblivious yes, bad no. What would make him a bad person is accepting new lives into our home knowing full well he wouldn\u2019t be providing their care. That\u2019s why he leaves those decisions up to me. OP\u2019s in-laws and husband overstepped.", "So he brought the fish to your house but not his ex wife's? Funny how he listened to her but not you.", "You so badly want to make her husband bad. She, OP, is the one who told him the fish were not to go to the ex wife either and that the grandparents need to deal with the fish.", "I had this issue too when one kid came home with fish, the other with a gerbal. Neither lasted long in our house. Told in-laws NO means NO.", "NTA. \nLet your husband know that fish are not low maintenance, and in fact sometimes higher maintenance than dogs! \nThey should be his responsibility now, and his new friend is FishForThought on youtube.", "Well, there is only one simple solution. The kids will take care of it, if not the fish will leave.... either fish have toilett adventure, or you can \"sell\" it via internet...", "Yta. Are you kidding me? It's a fuckin goldfish that will probably die in a week anyway. Let your kids have these experiences and lighten up", "NTA... it's disturbing they would play around with animal's lives like this. They all sound like the people to give the kids rabbits on Easter then release them outside.", "As a fish keeper can I pick your brain? We have an irrigation pond out back, I\u2019ve seen tadpoles in there so I know there\u2019s some wild life. Could we take them back there?", "Which is just another reason I don\u2019t want them in my house. I don\u2019t want to watch an animal suffer and die. Whether I like fish or not, that\u2019s just not my jam", "Oh my god a gerbil?! Thats horrible and exactly why I want to send them back. I want this nipped before it\u2019s something bigger \ud83d\ude2d", "My husband and I already confirmed they\u2019ll be going back to the in-laws. He doesn\u2019t want them either, he felt very put on the spot because he didn\u2019t know the kids had them when he went to pick them up either. But we want to make it clear to the in laws that we will not accept pets. Sending them back for them to deal with will hopefully drive that point home and prevent any future pets being sent home", "So I should just be okay with someone sending a pet to my house without asking us? One I\u2019ve expressly said I don\u2019t want (that my husband doesn\u2019t want either, by the way.) I should just decide to be okay with watching an animal suffer and die, or assume responsibility for the care of something I didn\u2019t want or agree to when I\u2019m already caring for 2 kids, 4 dogs, a home, and my 37 week pregnant self? I should assume all the cost for said pet because if you read 97% of responses to this thread, goldfish aren\u2019t actually low maintenance and require A LOT of work? I should ignore the express clause in our lease prohibiting fish?", "I genuinely just think people don\u2019t see fish as real animals. Even this thread is full of people like \u201cwho cares they\u2019ll die in a few days!\u201d And I\u2019m like why is that something you\u2019re so flippant about\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72", "To stop an argument tell him you will give it some time.  \nFirst time they don\u2019t get fed for one day or the first time the tank isn\u2019t cleaned give them back", "Could you tell him \"I am not willing to care for those fish, nor see them neglected. So if a single one of their care chores is a day late, I will be surrendering them to the nearest responsible place.\"?", "Ooof. Poor kid! I wonder if he ever knew that's why no one wanted to go to his parties...", "It depends. The reason that goldfish cannot be placed in wild/natural ponds is because they are extremely invasive - they eat any smaller fish/animals, breed quickly, dig through the substrate (which disturbs/kills plants) and are less sensitive to chemicals. Basically, they can quickly overrun an ecosystem. \n\nIf there was bad weather/lots of rain, is there any chance of the goldfish washing out to natural ponds?\n\n What animals use your pond, apart from the tadpoles? Putting them in will get rid of the tadpoles, and most other animals that live in the pond. \n\nAre there other places for the frogs to go?\n\nIf they will wash out to nearby ponds in severe rain, than don't put them in. \n\nIf there is nowhere else for the frogs to go, check what species of frog first. If they are mostly a common frog, than the loss of the pond won't be a *big* issue. However, if it is an endangered species, I would not recommend adding goldfish. \n\nBut apart from that, yes, you could put them in there. You would still need to feed them, but only every 2-4 days. You won't need to clean it out any more often than you already do, as the rain collected in it should do that pretty well. \n\nAlso, I am not too familiar with *irrigation* ponds specifically, so I am assuming that it is a regular pond that collects rainwater, and overflows/spreads it to the surrounding land to water plants. (which is what I think it is, but I may be wrong)", "Believe me. I hear you. Send them back if you're local.", "Yep!! Great comment!", "Honestly I\u2019m not even willing to compromise that. To send a pet here without permission in my view is unacceptable and if we keep them for any length of time we invite repeat behavior. I did talk with him, he\u2019s upset by it as well and just felt really put on the spot. They\u2019re going back to the in-laws today", "That\u2019s just another reason I don\u2019t want them in my house. Whether I like fish or not, I don\u2019t want to watch an animal suffer and die", "My friend won one from a fair. We lived down the street so she left it with me and was supposed to come back for it. She never did. Stupid fish lived 4 years. Hated that thing", "I don\u2019t know how to take care of them, and if you read anything in this thread from people who actually do take care of them, they\u2019re actually not at all low maintenance or good for kids. \nAnd yeah it may hurt my in-laws feelings, but what about my feelings and boundaries that were expressly overstepped when a pet was sent home without permission being asked? What\u2019s the next pet going to be if these boundaries aren\u2019t affirmed\nEdited to add its very weird to guilt trip someone over having a child, whether they have step children or not. They\u2019ve BEGGED me to have a baby with their dad for literal years\u2026.", "I'm sure you not trying to be rude, (and I'm not trying to be either) but you seem like the kind of person to claim that \"I'm so good at taking care of fish, my goldfish lived for almost 2yrs!\" and tell everyone that what your doing is correct, and that you are very knowledgeable in fish, when goldfish can live for 1-2 DECADES. \n\nI promise I don't mean this in a mean way, I'm just saying that you should fact check before you give advice.", "You are 100% correct in this line of thinking. Permission before pets are given is a non-negotiable. NTA", "You really should have put the extra info in your post. Maybe add an edit to the end?", "That's fair.... and your husband is not super fish- educated if he thinks they're easy....Beta's are the easiest.... you can put them in a vase with a place\nPeace lilly and they'll thrive.... but gold fish? Absolutely not. Just 1 needs a 30gal tank with a GREAT filter with how much nitrogen they put out", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 ... Awe... my kiddo won one when she was 4... it didn't make it to morning; had to scramble to flush him before she woke up.... hey little heart break killed me.... so she got a full tank for Christmas for Molly's/ good\nGuppies.... loved my fish... did well for about a yr then my filter died overnight and I didn't notice till I got home from work and my fish all died.", "LMAO!!", "Great comment and retort! I agree with everything you said!", "Which extra info, just that he and I spoke when he got home?", "They would take care of them as best they could, which I\u2019m sure wouldn\u2019t be sufficient given all the information I\u2019ve learned in this thread about goldfish care. But it would drive home the point to them that sending the kids home with something like that is unacceptable, and given the fact that one way or another these fish are going to die, probably pretty soon, unfortunately that\u2019s almost more important at this point\ud83d\ude1e", "No he\u2019s definitely not and he doesn\u2019t like or want fish either, he just felt very put on the spot. I think he feels more indifferent toward watching them suffer and die than I do, however.", "Oh, my! lol", "I'm not trying to make him bad I just misunderstood who said what. I don't need to try tbh, he still disregarded her wishes regarding the fish"]}
