It was a really nice wedding ceremony and then later on we were sitting at the reception as the wedding party entered.\n\nThe entrances were like they all were, a little ridiculous and cringey but it is what it is, just your typical wedding entrances. Then the best man and the maid of honor were introduced and in their entrance, the maid of honor twirled the best man and I thought that it was a little weird but just chalked it up to being silly and having fun.\n\nThen came the toast from the best man. In the toast, the best man didn\u2019t use a script on his phone and just spoke to everyone, a crowd of 400, which was surprising to me because typically men, at the other weddings that I\u2019ve been to, need some material to go off of and keep their speech going. In the speech, he didn\u2019t really seem to touch on the more masculine things that you typically see in best man speeches but rather on things I thought were more feminine. When he finished the speech, he went directly in for a hug with the groom rather than a typical handshake or whatever else guys do. \n\nAll of this and plus how much it seemed he cared about his appearance led me to say to the girl next to me; \u201cThat was a good speech and all but do you think that he is bisexual?\u201d\n\nShe responded, \u201cWell that is his fianc\u00e9 right there\u201d as she pointed across the table to a girl, to which I then turned to her and asked the same thing, if he was bisexual.\n\nShe looked confused and said, \u201cNo\u201d to which I responded \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\nThe girl next to the best man\u2019s \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d, immediately responded, \u201cWell I am his (the best man\u2019s) sister and I think I would know if he was.\u201d And it turns out that I was at a table with many of the groomsmen\u2019s plus ones and some of their family members. I took the hint to change the subject but it seemed like it was a touchy subject for some reason. \n\nThe night went on and apparently word had gotten back to the groom\u2019s family, my boyfriend is the groom\u2019s uncle, and the grooms\u2019s family was upset with the comments that I made, as it turns out the best man is really close to their family and felt embarrassed that someone would say this to him and some thought I should apologize to the best man and his fianc\u00e9 for continuing to press questions. But I felt it was a valid question that I was curious about and even tried to defend it more by saying he seemed to care too much about his appearance and that he danced with a bunch of people and not just his fianc\u00e9 throughout the night (not grinding or anything but just didn\u2019t have his full attention on only dancing with his fianc\u00e9).\n\nThis has caused a small strain in my relationship with my boyfriend because his family is upset with me but I don\u2019t think it is valid.

It was a really nice wedding ceremony and then later on we were sitting at the reception as the wedding party entered.\n\nThe entrances were like they all were, a little ridiculous and cringey but it is what it is, just your typical wedding entrances. Then the best man and the maid of honor were introduced and in their entrance, the maid of honor twirled the best man and I thought that it was a little weird but just chalked it up to being silly and having fun.\n\nThen came the toast from the best man. In the toast, the best man didn\u2019t use a script on his phone and just spoke to everyone, a crowd of 400, which was surprising to me because typically men, at the other weddings that I\u2019ve been to, need some material to go off of and keep their speech going. In the speech, he didn\u2019t really seem to touch on the more masculine things that you typically see in best man speeches but rather on things I thought were more feminine. When he finished the speech, he went directly in for a hug with the groom rather than a typical handshake or whatever else guys do. \n\nAll of this and plus how much it seemed he cared about his appearance led me to say to the girl next to me; \u201cThat was a good speech and all but do you think that he is bisexual?\u201d\n\nShe responded, \u201cWell that is his fianc\u00e9 right there\u201d as she pointed across the table to a girl, to which I then turned to her and asked the same thing, if he was bisexual.\n\nShe looked confused and said, \u201cNo\u201d to which I responded \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\nThe girl next to the best man\u2019s \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d, immediately responded, \u201cWell I am his (the best man\u2019s) sister and I think I would know if he was.\u201d And it turns out that I was at a table with many of the groomsmen\u2019s plus ones and some of their family members. I took the hint to change the subject but it seemed like it was a touchy subject for some reason. \n\nThe night went on and apparently word had gotten back to the groom\u2019s family, my boyfriend is the groom\u2019s uncle, and the grooms\u2019s family was upset with the comments that I made, as it turns out the best man is really close to their family and felt embarrassed that someone would say this to him and some thought I should apologize to the best man and his fianc\u00e9 for continuing to press questions. But I felt it was a valid question that I was curious about and even tried to defend it more by saying he seemed to care too much about his appearance and that he danced with a bunch of people and not just his fianc\u00e9 throughout the night (not grinding or anything but just didn\u2019t have his full attention on only dancing with his fianc\u00e9).\n\nThis has caused a small strain in my relationship with my boyfriend because his family is upset with me but I don\u2019t think it is valid.

Anyone who didn't know me may have thought I wasn't masculine, but the reason behind my painted nails was that I played baseball, and as a catcher it was easier for the pitcher to see signs if my nails were painted bright pink, yellow or green. I shaved my arms and legs because I taped my wrists and ankles for football and baseball and didn't like the tape pulling my hair.
