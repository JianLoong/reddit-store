Are you going to take care of our daughter when you tour or leave her behind? How will you deal with groupies?\"  \n\"So why dont you drink? are you recovering?\"  \n\n\nEach question got more hostile and it was obvious they were getting drunk, most of the questions came from her dad but her mom was nodding and agreeing. Eventually they asked in a very angry way \"Dont change my daughter too much or youll have to deal with me, and im not like the men you see on tv nowadays\". It seemed very much like a threat so i joked I wouldnt do that because i love her a lot and smiled.   \n\n\nHe got up and started getting really angry saying he knew what i was up to. Pretending to be someone else so I can \"get with his daughter\". Despite me being there for her more than they ever have in their life. I just looked at my gf and she said that we should go and I left.  \n\n\nMorning after they text me apologizing but i blocked them for now and will probably unblock in a few weeks when im over it.  Now my gfs sister texts me a few hours later saying why did I block them, I need to apologize and im in the wrong. She wasnt even there and my Gf agrees with my side.

Were they constantly bombarding you with texts or it was just a message or two? I mean you are right to be upset. And you definitely don't have to apologize for anything. But consider that these people are going to stay in your life as long as you are in relationship with this girl, so you don't have much choice there.

That's rough talk for a dinner convo. Betcha they feel bad now and texted ya 'cause of it. Sister should back off, she wasn't there to see how awkward that was.

Quite the reverse, in fact.\n\n I think your girlfriend\u2019s parents are probably alcoholics and you have just missed this behavior before. I say this because their behavior goes with being mean drunks. They were offended because you wouldn\u2019t join them in drinking wine, then escalated to your guitar and religious views and your intentions toward their daughter.
