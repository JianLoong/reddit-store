That absolutely doesn't justify his appalling behaviour, but if you feel able to talk to him, it might be worth trying to have a conversation.

Are you in therapy or grief counseling? It would be really helpful for you, especially since your dad is the type who thinks men shouldn't show emotion (which is BS, btw).\n\nOh, and NTA.", "Hopefully you get it back", "OP, I know you said in another comment that your dad is normally a good father. However, as a father myself, what you just posted here shows that he isn't being a good father. Real men aren't afraid of showing emotions. Your emotions are part of who you are.\n\nOne of the most unhealthy things you can do is to bottle up all of your emotions inside because it almost always leads to an explosion. Look at your father. He thinks, like so many people do, that men shouldn't show emotions. So, instead of letting them out, he bottled them up. And after you were rightly upset about him pawning off the bikes, his emotions exploded out and he lashed out in anger. I truly do not think he has actually processed his grief over the death of your mother because he thinks grief would make him less of a man. So, now he's making rash decisions and lashing out. When he should be facing his grief head-on with the other person in his household who is a living link to her memory, their son. You should be facing your grief together, and it's wrong that you're not able to because your father is afraid of being perceived as weak.\n\nThat being said, he's that way in large part because that's what society tells him. So much of our society tells men \"Don't you dare be weak and show emotions. You hold all that in.\" I might get downvoted some for this, but it's not just other men who can be terrible to men who are in touch with their emotions. A hell of a lot of women will ridicule a man who is emotional too. Both men and women are on the hook for this, and it needs to stop.\n\nOP, hopefully you can at least get your bike back from the pawn shop so you can have that last cherished gift from your mother. And I can always hope that, if your father has a conscience, that this becomes a wakeup call for him. That he could realize how terrible what he did was and that it was directly due to holding in his emotions and not allowing himself to grieve for his wife. Then, maybe you could face this grief together as father and son. Like it's truly supposed to be.\n\nOh, and obviously NTA. Should probably throw that in there.", "NTA, he should have pawned just about everything HE owns before stealing your bike and pawning it. The money problems are HIS problem to take responsibility for, not yours.\n\nBikes are special. The bike my father got me for my 16th birthday was stolen when I was 40 (43 now). I was very sad, and can\u2019t imagine how much worse it is for you."]}
