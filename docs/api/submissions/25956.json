At the very least, it should have been a discussion.\n\nThis was deliberate. He's getting rid of memories of your mom. Look around to see what else is missing. I bet it's none of his stuff.

Can you report it stolen?\n\nI would file a police report and see how you can get it back from the pawn shop.", "INFO did he pawn them or sell them?  If he pawned them is he planning on getting them back?  If he sold them did you call the cops and report the bikes as stolen?", "NTA.  But he didn't get much for them and you can probably get them back for not much more than he got for them.", "Definitely NTA\n\nThat was the last gift your mom gave to you and he had no right to do what he did, without asking or otherwise. \n\nINFO: did you ask your dad if there was any other reason he might have gotten rid of it? Did he sell anything else? Just playing devil\u2019s advocate here but if he didn\u2019t sell anything else, maybe the sight of them made him feel bad because he never did any of those things with you guys\u2026 I\u2019m really fishing here because in previous comments, you said he was a good dad otherwise. \n\nEither way, he shouldn\u2019t have done it and if he was grieving, he could have found another way to do it\u2026\n\nEdited to fix a word", "NTA at all. So sorry this happened to you and sorry for your loss. Is your dad usually a decent father? I feel like there are two possibilities here- either he's a massive asshole who doesn't really think about other people's feelings or he's in a genuinely dire financial situation and felt like he had no choice, eg if he's in medical debt because your mum was sick, or he can't afford to pay the rent or mortgage on one salary. That absolutely doesn't justify his appalling behaviour, but if you feel able to talk to him, it might be worth trying to have a conversation. If things are bad financially, he might think he's protecting you by not saying anything. Which is obviously stupid if he goes and does something like this, but I do wonder if there's stuff going on you don't know about.\n\nDo you have any other family that could help you out?
