Are you in therapy or grief counseling? It would be really helpful for you, especially since your dad is the type who thinks men shouldn't show emotion (which is BS, btw).\n\nOh, and NTA.", "Hopefully you get it back", "OP, I know you said in another comment that your dad is normally a good father. However, as a father myself, what you just posted here shows that he isn't being a good father. Real men aren't afraid of showing emotions. Your emotions are part of who you are.\n\nOne of the most unhealthy things you can do is to bottle up all of your emotions inside because it almost always leads to an explosion. Look at your father. He thinks, like so many people do, that men shouldn't show emotions. So, instead of letting them out, he bottled them up. And after you were rightly upset about him pawning off the bikes, his emotions exploded out and he lashed out in anger. I truly do not think he has actually processed his grief over the death of your mother because he thinks grief would make him less of a man. So, now he's making rash decisions and lashing out. When he should be facing his grief head-on with the other person in his household who is a living link to her memory, their son. You should be facing your grief together, and it's wrong that you're not able to because your father is afraid of being perceived as weak.\n\nThat being said, he's that way in large part because that's what society tells him. So much of our society tells men \"Don't you dare be weak and show emotions. You hold all that in.\" I might get downvoted some for this, but it's not just other men who can be terrible to men who are in touch with their emotions. A hell of a lot of women will ridicule a man who is emotional too. Both men and women are on the hook for this, and it needs to stop.\n\nOP, hopefully you can at least get your bike back from the pawn shop so you can have that last cherished gift from your mother. And I can always hope that, if your father has a conscience, that this becomes a wakeup call for him. That he could realize how terrible what he did was and that it was directly due to holding in his emotions and not allowing himself to grieve for his wife. Then, maybe you could face this grief together as father and son. Like it's truly supposed to be.\n\nOh, and obviously NTA. Should probably throw that in there.", "NTA, he should have pawned just about everything HE owns before stealing your bike and pawning it.

It is quite possible he did not actually pawn the bikes but gave them to someone, especially if a woman has a teenager.  As others stated, look around.  Your dad is clearing your mother out.

Assuming you are based in the US, medical bills, costs of funeral and keeping up everything with one salary instead of combined income can put a lot of stress on one. But still, he should have asked or at least be interested anough in you as a person to KNOW what that bike meant to you.\n\nMaybe seeing those bikes were hard on him and he cant admit so he got rid of them?

I saved for 7 months and on my 17th birthday (I graduated high school right before I turned 17) I moved out. Did talk to my sperm donor for about 3 years.

(and then has the audacity to be a massive ahole about it afterwards as well)\nSo reporting it stolen is probably the only way to get it back, if you dont have the funds to buy it back. Or find something of your dads' to pawn off and trade for the bike..\nYou probably do have to be quick about acting on it if you decide to try and get it back.\nAlso, like others have said before me, if there's other things in the house that are of any kind of value to you, make sure you put them somewhere safe and out of reach of your dad.\nI really hope you'll get the bike back!", "I\u2019m so sorry.
