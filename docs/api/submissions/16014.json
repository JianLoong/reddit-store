I don't use Reddit very often.\n\nMy son(14m) is in therapy for some trauma that happened when he was living with his mother. Recently, the therapist suggested that a pet of some kind might be a good idea for him.\n\nI talked it out with my wife, and we couldn't come to an agreement. We went through every kind of pet I could think of, but she vetoed cats, dogs, reptiles, and rodents. (I didn't want to deal with amphibians or birds either; I don't think they're beginner-friendly pets.)\n\nFinally, the other day I was in town with my son getting groceries at Walmart when I spotted a little one-litre beta tank on the shelf in the pet aisle. I pointed it out to my son, who seemed happy with that idea. So I got the kit, went to the pet store for a fish and some food, brought it home, and set it up. I sent my wife a text reading that I was getting him a fish, with a picture of the fish, but it didn't go through (which I didn't realize.) and she was at her sister's house when we got home. I thought she knew about it, but I guess I should've followed up? She has a tendency to not answer my texts, so I just assume she got them because she doesn't like it when I \"repeat myself\".\n\nIt doesn't take up much space, and it gets cleaned once a week. All he has to do is feed it once a day and look at it. Obviously, it won't make a mess. My wife spotted it earlier (mind you, I bought it on Tuesday.) and freaked out. Now she's saying I'm a jerk for getting him a pet without her say. I think I can get my son a fish in my own home. It isn't hurting her, and she doesn't even notice it's there.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: the tank is one gallon, not one liter. That's my bad.\n\nEdit. Alright, the tank is too small. I'll fix it, Thank you.

This might be a different family therapy part though.\n\nI agree that the pet suggestion is good and clearly your kid is into this idea so you're NTA for that. The rush is where you step back into the gray: all pets require research into how to care or what type is best for the situation. You say it's \"just a fish lol\" but it's still callous to mistreat a living thing and if your son is actually loving this fish having it get sick and die is just going to hurt him more or make him think he was at fault or that he cant' do anything correctly.

You could have also considered a plant. \nIt is vital to a healthy family dynamic that parents work out their disagreements calmly and in private, then present a united front to the children.
