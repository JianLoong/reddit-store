Her kids likely don\u2019t follow this off the wall diet when at friend\u2019s houses, or at school, or wherever they\u2019re not under her control. \n\nNTA, but I think your husband needs to spearhead this fight with you for support. If these kids don\u2019t have food related allergies, her list of rules is a bit inhumane and unnecessary. \n\nMaybe your husband needs to initiate court intervention in terms of parenting, because Kate is not approaching this rationally. I can\u2019t imagine a pediatrician or any other doctor backing this food regimen. Kate needs some therapy, and MIL needs to stay in her lane or get behind her son, not former DIL.", "This is a difficult one as you can see where Kate's issues stem from and she's projecting these onto your household.\n\nA restrictive diet for children is setting up all kinds of eating problems for later in life. It's even causing problems for them now with feelings of being different.\n\nYou need to stick to your guns here. Let her take you to court and then you will have an opportunity to evidence her behaviour and demands. It won't take very much to see that she's being unreasonable and I would doubt very much that custody would be changed on the basis of what you have reported.  It may even prompt some change for her in the form of support.  You might even argue that this is child protection issue, as bizarre as that sounds, given that Kate believes she is already protecting them.\n\nThis is an awful situation for you all to be in but honestly, as hard as this is going to be, those children will be so much more settled and healthy if you and your husband instil the 'my house my rules' statement.\n\nIf MIL supports it then let her do it. Don't get involved in conversations giving your point of view, and don't defend or apologise for it. Your job right now is to keep drama to a minimum and bring some stability and common sense to your children's (step or otherwise) lives\n\nNTA", "NTA - as you pointed out it's not medical or science based. Just be polite empathetic and firm.\n\nIf she takes you to court nothing will happen...stressful of course but she won't get anything. Also that no drinking one is arguably unsafe.", "NTA. When the kids are at your house, they should follow your rules. When they're at their mom's house, they should follow their mom's rules.\n\nNow of course it would be really helpful if those rules were at least somewhat similar, but Kate's trauma is not your fault or her kids' fault. She can't force (unreasonable) food rules if there is no good reason for it. As long as you're feeding them healthy food, there should be no problem.", "Nta. Kate had a trauma which is terrible for her and the whole family, but she can't keep the other kids in a bubble over it. Kate really needs a therapist, the kids can't live like that.", "NTA. They\u2018re not just Kate\u2019s kids - they\u2019re also your husband\u2019s kids, too, which means he gets a say in making decisions for them when they\u2019re under his care. And these rules\u2026..these are not logical or normal. No fruit after 5pm? No drink while eating - so you can\u2019t sip a glass of water while you eat a sandwich? No combining starches and carbs - so you couldn\u2019t have rice and veggies together in a meal? They\u2019re not based on any nutritional advice I\u2019ve ever read, and frankly sound like they\u2019d make it quite difficult to eat sensible, balanced meals. Also, the FODMAP thing drives me crazy - I have a cousin who periodically goes on a no FODMAP food, ignoring the fact that FODMAP is an approach that\u2019s supposed to help people figure out their intolerances by eliminating a bunch of things and then gradually reintroducing them. It\u2019s not meant to be a list of things never to eat again.    \n\n\nI have a great deal of sympathy for Kate after the death of her third child, and can absolutely see how that trauma could lead to her current food obsessions. But the answer isn\u2019t to force her living kids onto a weird, restrictive diet. Kate needs therapy to work through this, and if she tries taking you to court to force through custody changes based on her Google Doc of ever-changing rules, I suspect she\u2019s going to be unpleasantly surprised. No judge is going to penalise you for serving kids a veggie stir fry over rice, with a glass of water on the side and a bowl of fruit salad for dessert\u2026..a simple meal that would be forbidden under Kate\u2019s regime.", "NTA. You're following your husband's rules on his kids in his home. What Kate went through with her third child is awful, but she needs professional help to come to terms with it, not to force her other children into an eating disorder as a result. How your husband feeds his kids during his custody time is up to him as long as they are looked after. MIL needs to stay out of it.", "NTA this is not rational behavior.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve said n.a.h if Kate hadn\u2019t threatened to take their dad back to court about the custody. He honestly needs to address this in an extreme way himself. Going back to court and explaining this situation may be a good thing because she actually needs to go to therapy and stop taking out her issues on her kids. It\u2019s very sad she\u2019s going through all this and she has my sympathy, but she can\u2019t traumatize her kids around food because of it. What she\u2019s doing at this point is bordering on abuse, if not actually is abuse. It comes from the best place but terrifying kids about food is harmful. Hopefully your husband is appropriately concerned and has some ideas of next steps. I honestly don\u2019t know outside of getting a lawyer and forcing her to go to court ordered therapy, which obviously won\u2019t help the coparenting relationship, but for the sake of the kids it would probably be good.", "NTA.  When you divorce, you lose a lot of control over your kids as the other parent has them part of the time.  This loss of control includes not being able to dictate what they eat when they're at their dad's.\n\nPerhaps your husband could take them to their doctor to discuss diet and specifically what Kate is requesting.  If there is no medical reason for her rules and restrictions, then if she goes back to court, you will have the doctor's opinion to support you.", "You're NTA. Her degree in nutrition from Google U is not going to convince a judge to restrict the kids from seeing their dad. She's on the road to giving her kids major eating problems. Also, she is not the sole decider of anything for the kids. She doesn't get to force you to enforce her rules at your home.", "NTA. Gluten-free diets are not necessary if you don't have coeliac disease or a gluten intolerance.  It's not a 'healthier' diet and doesn't help with weight control, especially as gluten-free substitutes often have additional fat and sugar to make them palatable.\n\nAs a coeliac, I don't understand why anyone would be on a gluten-free diet if they didn't have to be.  It's not fun.", "NTA. You are not obligated to follow Kate's food rules for her kids when they are at your place. Her rules are unreasonable, unscientific and unhealthy. \n\nShe is imposing her beliefs and fears on the kids and you, and that's not fair or respectful.\n\nYou have the right to feed the kids a balanced and normal diet, without following a bunch of arbitrary and restrictive rules. Some people may think that you are being insensitive or dismissive of Kate's trauma and love for the kids, but you are not. \n\nYou are being rational and practical.", "NTA. The restrictions are simply too much. Let her take you to court, get a lawyer and a nutritionist, because you will win.", "NTA- your husband needs to address this issue with his ex and the kids\u2019 doctor. Her rules are unsustainable and her fears are hurting the kids.", "NTA. I'm sorry for all involved about the loss of a child, but I don't even think her attorney will take this up.", "NTA\n\nI've given this verdict only because her requests have no medical reason or scientific backing. Placing rules on a child's diet based on individual studies is ridiculous. \n\nChildren have a balanced or varied diet unless there is a valid scientifically proven reason to do so. And this is indicated by a doctor or recognised dietician.\n\nDon't know what country you're in, but there are laws here in Oz doesn't recognise fad diets or Facebook articles. \n\nI think meet her halfway. As there is a difference in opinion about what the kids should be eating, get professional advice with second opinions.\n\nEnd of arguments. I'm assuming that you would normally give balanced non processed meals suitable for growing bodies, and that she is not working off any medical advice or scientific studies.", "NTA\n\nNormally I would say that food rules should be followed or at least hashed out between parents, but these rules are nonsensical. She's going to give the kids eating disorders. She needs to deal with her trauma professionally.", "NTA. Your husband is thier parent also so he gets an equal say. If she goes to court with that list she risks losing custody. I won't call her AH after losing a child, but she needs therapy. Those kids will grow up resenting her if she doesn't back off.", "I got to the 2nd sentence in the 2nd paragraph and: NTA\n\nLet her take you to court.  Judge will think she\u2019s batshit", "NTA. But if Kate really wants it\u2019s to happen the way she wants she has to provide more than a google doc of donts. Maybe if she provides food and recipes but even that would be a lot. She needs to speak with someone about what she\u2019s going through. This isn\u2019t you job to communicate this to her.", "Kate has grief and anxiety issues that she is managing by controlling her children's food, which will lead to huge issues for the children.  It's 100% not appropriate and not fair to the kids.\n\nYou and DH might want to consider suing for full custody.  MIL should keep out of this, and Kate needs serious psychological help.", "I eat quite a restrictive diet but this is next level. The diet itself doesn't seem unreasonable but it's the rigidity of it that's the problem. I feel so sorry for the kids, they should be able to eat a little treat once in a while, just like everybody else. NTA. Your MIL needs to get Kate the help she needs rather than supporting this behaviour. She clearly needs grief counseling to try to learn to cope with her grief/fear in a more healthy way than hyper controlling what her children eat.", "NTA. The kids are old enough to make their own decision around whether these are restrictions they want to follow", "I came in so prepared to say yes but oh my word, those restrictions O\\_O What happens if you combine starches and carbs?! O\\_O am i missing something? no fruit after 5 why? This level of restriction is not a good idea to instill into kids heading into becoming teens. I get Kates afraid but this isnt how you help kids long term, with this level of restriction. \n\nNTA. If kids are being fed properly and there are no dietary allergies you need to follow, i dont see what Kate thinks the courts can realistically do.", "Document the shit out of this. I don't like to scream abuse, but these rules border on that for me. Sure, eating healthy is important, but these rules make no sense at all unless someone has serious medical issues. \n\nAllergens don't care about the time of the day, sugar content or if someone had ice in their drink. And what is the issue with carbs and gluten? Nobody gets harmed by Gnocchi with garlic bread on the side. Unless they're celiac or diabetic, ofc. NTA", "NTA\n\nI was going in thinking you would be the AH but these levels of restriction/rules that Kate imposes are unreal and that without any obvious medical reason/need or a religious/worldview reason like Kosher, Halal, veganism etc.\n\nKate clearly has not processed the trauma of losing their youngest kid to a food allergy. But it's extremely unlikely that they would lose one of their other two kids to a food allergy (this must be the fear that is driving this level of diet control she imposes on her kids). Her child was too young to describe what he was feeling. Her child was left in the care of what I assume was a teenager or very young adult who clearly did not understand what anaphylaxis is or what it looks like. This was a very unfortunate kind of accident/failure to act and something no one would have foreseen (teenagers watch toddlers all the time and I bet many wouldn't have acted better, unfortunately).\n\nKate probably feels guilty for letting a teenager/inexperienced child minder watch her kid when this had lethal consequences. But controlling her much older children's diets isn't going to ease the pain of the death of the younger child. Maybe Kate needs to channel this energy into setting up a charity that aims to inform the public on food allergies in babies and younger children so that parents and baby sitters are better informed so they call an ambulance in time.\n\nThese other kids are 10 and 13 and will be much better educated than most parents even about food allergies I imagine, after what happened to the youngest child. I assume they may have also had allergy testing done? They are old enough now to understand the symptoms of anaphylaxis and that it means that you need to use an epi pen (if available) and call emergency services. You didn't mention that these kids have any known allergies so all these restrictions are unnecessary.\n\nThe situation is even harder because you two have children together that you rightly don't want to impose these rules on.\n\nI'd put my foot down, say no to all of these things, and let Kate take you guys to court over this. Then you can make your case that there's no medical or religious/worldview reason for these restrictions, that the restrictions is making it extremely difficult for you to cater to these kids' diet during the time they are at yours, that it is causing tensions between these kids and the kids you have with your partner, and maybe the kids are also sick of having to eat like this? They are at an age now where they probably get pocket money so they will be able to buy their own treats soon. Does she expect her kids to never stray from this rigid diet when their mates are getting burgers, ice cream, candy bars, pizza, soda?\n\nThis diet is completely unsustainable.\n\nETA: I have been vegetarian by choice since I was around 13 and vegan since my late 20s so I know what it means to have a restrictive diet. But I chose my vegan diet (as part of a vegan lifestyle) for my own reasons (animal welfare). It was not so easy to be vegan when I went vegan (in 2014) as it is these days, but it was still so much easier than what you describe!\n\nETA 2: In 2008 (?) there was a case of a mother in the Netherlands who fed her child only raw vegan food (vegan, uncooked and unheated food). Child-protective services got involved because there were fears that this diet would not be in the best interest of a growing child. Most media will be in Dutch I'm afraid but this is an angle to consider if you guys have to go back to court. I'm not in favour of getting the government involved when it comes to dietary choices, not at all, my niblings are raised vegan but they get to eat ALL vegan food whether that's frozen, cooked, raw, highly processed or whole-foods. Diet and health is a difficult subject but it might be worth trying to find a specialist in child nutrition to see if you can get info on whether Kate's diet is harmful for these kids' health, if it gets to the point where you need to go nuclear.", "NTA I know it\u2019s a pain to pay the legal fees but you probably have no choice.
