Keep recording her bad behavior.", "[deleted]", "This! OP is NTA! \n\nRecording someone against their knowledge can be illegal in some places, so if you want to do it again make sure you're legally OK.\n\nWith that said, the only reason your sister is offended by you recording her is that she can't say she never said that like she used to do before (I'm assuming) because you have the proof, so she gets pissed she got caught. I'm sure she does it to get away with her actions like she doesn't want to was the pan, she'll say don't rush me when you need it, just to seem like she doesn't want to do it but you need it now and end up washing it for her, then she gets mad because you washed it for her when in reality she's only mad because she got caught being lazy and not wanting to do it when you needed the pan.", "I agree nta, but i disagree with the laziness part. Imo, her behavior sounds identical to that of mine and some of my friends before being treated for depression and adhd. Lazy people aren't bothered by their own actions,  but people who are struggling with mental health issues are often incrediby frustrated by the difficulties they make for themselves.", "How was her privacy violated here, exactly? He recorded something she was saying to him, and then played it back to her. The only people who heard the recording were them. Nothing \u2018private\u2019 was revealed to anyone who wasn\u2019t already fully aware of what happened.", "It's also OPs home though? They're brother and sister, and from the context of the post, they live together under the same roof. OP is recording audio only with the intention of playing it back to his sister as a learning moment, it's nothing really nefarious", "It's only illegal if it's used against you in a formal, legal way.  It's not illegal unless it's published.  You can show someone their own recording as long as it isn't posted.\n\nIn one's own home, one resident can consent to recording within the home without informing the other residents or visitors, like a nanny cam-you don't have to inform guests.", "If she was just lazy she wouldn't complain when he does it for her. It sounds a lot like OP is leaving out the part where he or someone else in the house possibly has a history of berating her for having to clean up after her so she insists on doing it herself but struggles with time management or executive dysfunction.", "There are some places if the party being recorded isn't aware it's being recorded for any reason it's illegal... not that she'll report it, but she seems crazy enough.", "NTA, but you should have a sit down with your sister.  Apologize for hurting her feelings, but tell her you are tired of her giving you 'no win' scenarios.  Either she cleans after herself or asks others to help.  Also with the car, she either moves it when necessary or doesn't mind if someone moves it for her.  She needs to modify her behavior or else you will completely start ignoring her comments about your actions.", "NTA. If you want to amuse yourself some more, take a page from litigation lawyers and get her to really commit before playing the recording. Like you do the dishes, she says you could have asked, you tell her you did ask, and she says no you didn't. You say are you sure about that? And when she says yes, you pull out your phone and play the recording. Pretty soon, you wont have to record her and play it anymore because the second she denies reality all you'll have to do is ask her if she's sure and reach for your pocket and she will cave. Eventually she will stop messing with you altogether. It is a solid training technique.", "I think recording is wrong when you go into it with an agenda or push people to say things. If it's just unprompted behavior it's really just a great quality memory. You are responsible for your words and actions even if you end up regretting them. This is what you said and how you said it. If you would behave differently because you are being recorded that is pretty clear evidence you don't believe in your own actions. NTA", "NTA. You wanna pruf to what se said and does, so if se dont likes, she can change", "NTA. Your sister needs to confront her hypocrisy.", "NTA - NTA - NTA  \n\n\nYour sister has a control issue, loves being mad, and inconveniencing people. That's what this is really about. No matter what you do, she'll be mad. But she knows she's inconveniencing people and enjoys the control she has over others. This whole \"wait until I leave if you need to go somewhere\" statement proves this. Even if you needed to leave right away, she would make you late. And she has absolutely no desire to change her behavior to prevent your inconvenience, or her anger, which tells me she loves both.  \n\n\nBe careful about the recording. Find out the recording laws in your state. A lot of states have a one-person consent law, which means if you are part of the conversation, you can record it. And if you are in a one-person consent state, to tell her that since she gets mad at you for not liking being inconvenienced by her behavior, you fully plan on CYA'ing, which means recording these conversations. You'd rather her be mad at you for something you did, than being mad at you for HER ACTIONS.", "NAH. \n\nDoes your sister have ADHD? It could be that she really genuinely does intend to clean the dishes, and that\u2019s why she gets upset when you do it first. She knows she \u201cshould have\u201d done them, and she\u2019s ashamed\u2026 and shame easily becomes anger.", "INFO:\n\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish?  Are you hoping she'll suddenly have an epiphany and change her ways?\n\nHere's a hint: you can't control her actions, feelings, anything at all to do with her.  Just yourself.\n\nGo read 'When I Say No, I Feel Guilty.'  Learn how to assert yourself and get what you want without needing to be 'right' or her to be 'wrong.'", "I would recommend you read a book called \"The Four Tendencies\" - because your sister sounds like a \"classic\" Rebel. The tagline for a rebel? 'No one can tell me what to do, not even me.' They are the type of person who tends to never do anything they \"are supposed to\" for a lot of reasons spelled out in the book. One of the key things I love about this book is that it has whole sections on \"how to live with/manage/motivate\" a person based on their tendency. It's been a big help for me with people like your sister. Understanding that even they don't quite know why they make their and everyone around them lives difficult can mean I can take out \"do it to annoy me\" and focus on the goal of \"getting something done or communicated\". It might help.", "Exactly. Is it gentle and kind? No. Should you use it when something less confrontational would work instead? Of course not. But she didn't leave you a choice. You apparently have tried these things and she has shown they don't work. I agree with other commenters that perhaps some executive function issues complicate sister's life. Perhaps familial support would help or is needed. However, as someone with similar difficulties, not being held accountable doesn't help her either. And he tried to do so. And if she gaslights (yes, even nice people with issues gaslight when defensive and ashamed) when being held accountable, and by being dismissive or disrespectful to boot - she needs to be called on it. At that point, she is being intentionally coercive to discourage being held accountable. That part shows awareness at least where consequences are concerned. So that part is a choice on some level. Which she has a proven history of doing repeatedly. She is using manipulative behaviors and is ignoring healthy responses. What comes after that? Bottom lines can get ugly, but enabling doesn't do anyone any good. NTA\nTldr: she couldn't or didn't or wouldn't hear the nicer ways of telling her. Either way, she then invalidated OP when he held her accountable. With a history of doing so, without gaining healthier skills to cope. So he held her accountable in an undeniableway.

Maybe she will do better or leave you alone.", "NTA", "NTA but I also echo the sentiment of another commenter that your sister sounds like a case of untreated depression and/or ADHD. Ideally she would consider getting assessed for those things, but in the meantime I often try to work on strategies that would help the person be successful even though they have debilitating procrastination etc, like every night at 9pm we wash all the dishes. Or set a reminder on your phone to do them. \n\nOr maybe there are some other good tips on r/ADHD for this type of stuff. Realistically she likely needs medication to keep on top of that stuff because all the other adhd women I know have identical problems with house keeping items like this.", "NTA, she has used before a lack of memory of her words and actions to justify her finding some way to find fault with you.\n\nNo I don't think you were rude, you are responding to an issue where someone is treating you wrong and standing up for yourself within your means.

She\u2019s so clearly TA for constantly putting it off and then getting angry. Its one measly pot that she wont wash but she\u2019ll get angry bc you washed it? What a weirdo. You did what you had to do bc clearly nothing was working. You dont need to gentle parent her bc she\u2019s a god damn adult and youre not her mom. Either do it or dont, but dont get mad when someone else takes it upon themselves to get shit done.", "NTA and good job recording her haha I may do that myself to a family member who does this", "I missed the part where you had a conversation with her about her behavior and how it affected you.

Otherwise, if you went right to recording, ESH.", "IF that\u2019s true then yes, they need to find better ways to communicate. \n\nBUT she doesn\u2019t get to do whatever the heck she wants because she has ADHD. \n\nLike, I have mild ADD and the least ADD husband you\u2019ve ever met, so we have some of these issues. \n\nWe had to work on it so that he found ways to tell me he needs me to step up without my feeling deeply unloved. But, he still has to tell me when he needs me to step up, and I need to hear it as that, not an attack on my worth as a human being. \n\nAnd me just being like, \u201cyeah, you can leave or eat when I feel like letting you\u201d just wouldn\u2019t be acceptable in any world.", "Also, even if she has a mental health problem, why is OP expected to either live with it or fix it??

Still, in those same 11 states, all audio recordings that are part of video from cameras require the consent of everyone. Since sister is of legal age, it would have to be given.", "Mental health and someone berating her\u2014like her parents\u2014are reasons for her aggressiveness. That having been said, if someone left dishes \n for day at her age\u2014maybe she needs a wake up call. Being berated may not be the best way and definitely shuts people down but also I\u2019d imagine everyone is at their wits end. Does that make berating okay\u2014not really but that\u2019s a natural consequence of her actions.
