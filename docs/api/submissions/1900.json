She does it a lot but one of the things she does is take a while to clean dishes. If she cooks something she'll rinse and put stuff like plates and silverware in the dishwasher but will leave pots and pans in the sink for days. However she hates if I(18m) or anyone does anything to help her. Beyond dishes like if she didn't finish ding something and someone else does it she will get offended. Like she thinks it is a personal attack against her. Lots of \"I could have done it myself.\" But if I need to use the dish and ask her to clean it so I can use it she gets upset at me for rushing her. One time I just washed the pot I needed, made mac n cheese, washed the pot, and put it away. She saw the pot was clean and asked if I cleaned it and I said that I needed to make mac n cheese. She got mad and said \"you could have asked me.\"  I said she'd still be mad if I asked and wouldn't do it when I needed it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell it happened again so this time I asked her. But this time I had my phone in my hand recording audio. She said \"don't rush me!\" So I went down and washed it and used it. She asked me about it and we go through the same process. \"You could have asked me.\" I just took out my phone and played the audio of me asking her and her snapping at me and she looked embarrassed hearing herself. Then she called me an asshole. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe also has a thing where she hates other people driving her car but will park directly behind mine or someone elses car in the driveway instead of on the street. Then she gets upset when someone moves it. She'll tell me to wait until she she leaves if I need to go somewhere. I recorded that and later when my car was behind hers and she asked me to move my car(I kept the keys with me this time) I just played the audio and she says I'm a big asshole for recording her. She's been pretty pissed about it. She does a list of things like this that I could record but I've only done it twice for the two things that hinder me the most. She looked pretty hurt when I played the audio for her. AITA? I was rude in the delivery. Like I didn't even respond. I just pulled out my phone and played the audio and said nothing to he", "created_utc": 1668008786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqmlnh/aita_for_secretly_recording_my_sister/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Recording someone can be a bit risky and a big breach of trust, in this instance, it\u2019s small annoyances so I\u2019d say it\u2019s fine.\n\nThe reason she\u2019s \u2018hurt\u2019 is that you\u2019re holding a mirror up to her and showing her how unreasonable and lazy she\u2019s being. She doesn\u2019t like it because who does like being called out? You\u2019ve done nothing wrong OP, hopefully she now realises", "NTA\n\n I don't know what her issue is called but she has an issue. You tried to let her in on what you have to deal with because of it. You repeating her words wouldn't have had any effect.\n\nTime will tell if hearing her own voice will make a difference to her.", "NTA.  She habitually lies and lies about her lying.  You called her on it and perhaps she will start being more honest now but I wouldn't hold my breath.", "NTA I think its fantastic you record her and play it back! Keep it up! Maybe she will learn to not be a selfish jerk to everyone", "NTA, she is clearly a hypocrite and when presented with evidence (rightly so) she adopts a victim mindset. \n\nYou should probably have had a conversation with her about it before directly recording it but you acted with anger, understandably so. Make sure you talk to her about it now though to save herself from future embarrassment", "I mean, it's kind if a dick move but she totally needed/needs a self awareness check so you weren't wrong. NTA. I think she hated getting caught.", "NTA. Dick move, but definitely NTA. Perfect way to prove a point when someone contradicts themselves all of the time.", "NTA.  She sounds exhausting.", "NTA. Hypocritical people need to be called out. She should be embarassed, so don\u2019t feel bad. She inconvienences you, then gaslights you into thinking she would\u2019ve done it while also ignoring your requests for her to do it. Continue recording the audio and make her feel worse about these situations until she stops being the AH herself. That victim complex she is pulling by calling you the AH in this is really pathetic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep recording her bad behavior.", "Secretly recording people in their own home is an AH move. Out in public is one thing, but people have a certain degree of privacy in their own home.", "This! OP is NTA! \n\nRecording someone against their knowledge can be illegal in some places, so if you want to do it again make sure you're legally OK.\n\nWith that said, the only reason your sister is offended by you recording her is that she can't say she never said that like she used to do before (I'm assuming) because you have the proof, so she gets pissed she got caught. I'm sure she does it to get away with her actions like she doesn't want to was the pan, she'll say don't rush me when you need it, just to seem like she doesn't want to do it but you need it now and end up washing it for her, then she gets mad because you washed it for her when in reality she's only mad because she got caught being lazy and not wanting to do it when you needed the pan.", "I agree nta, but i disagree with the laziness part. Imo, her behavior sounds identical to that of mine and some of my friends before being treated for depression and adhd. Lazy people aren't bothered by their own actions,  but people who are struggling with mental health issues are often incrediby frustrated by the difficulties they make for themselves.", "How was her privacy violated here, exactly? He recorded something she was saying to him, and then played it back to her. The only people who heard the recording were them. Nothing \u2018private\u2019 was revealed to anyone who wasn\u2019t already fully aware of what happened.", "It's also OPs home though? They're brother and sister, and from the context of the post, they live together under the same roof. OP is recording audio only with the intention of playing it back to his sister as a learning moment, it's nothing really nefarious", "It's only illegal if it's used against you in a formal, legal way.  It's not illegal unless it's published.  You can show someone their own recording as long as it isn't posted.\n\nIn one's own home, one resident can consent to recording within the home without informing the other residents or visitors, like a nanny cam-you don't have to inform guests.", "If she was just lazy she wouldn't complain when he does it for her. It sounds a lot like OP is leaving out the part where he or someone else in the house possibly has a history of berating her for having to clean up after her so she insists on doing it herself but struggles with time management or executive dysfunction.", "There are some places if the party being recorded isn't aware it's being recorded for any reason it's illegal... not that she'll report it, but she seems crazy enough."]}
