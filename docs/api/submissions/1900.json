However she hates if I(18m) or anyone does anything to help her. Beyond dishes like if she didn't finish ding something and someone else does it she will get offended. Like she thinks it is a personal attack against her. Lots of \"I could have done it myself.\" But if I need to use the dish and ask her to clean it so I can use it she gets upset at me for rushing her. One time I just washed the pot I needed, made mac n cheese, washed the pot, and put it away. She saw the pot was clean and asked if I cleaned it and I said that I needed to make mac n cheese. She got mad and said \"you could have asked me.\"  I said she'd still be mad if I asked and wouldn't do it when I needed it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell it happened again so this time I asked her. But this time I had my phone in my hand recording audio. She said \"don't rush me!\" So I went down and washed it and used it. She asked me about it and we go through the same process. \"You could have asked me.\" I just took out my phone and played the audio of me asking her and her snapping at me and she looked embarrassed hearing herself. Then she called me an asshole. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe also has a thing where she hates other people driving her car but will park directly behind mine or someone elses car in the driveway instead of on the street. Then she gets upset when someone moves it. She'll tell me to wait until she she leaves if I need to go somewhere. I recorded that and later when my car was behind hers and she asked me to move my car(I kept the keys with me this time) I just played the audio and she says I'm a big asshole for recording her. She's been pretty pissed about it. She does a list of things like this that I could record but I've only done it twice for the two things that hinder me the most. She looked pretty hurt when I played the audio for her. AITA? I was rude in the delivery. Like I didn't even respond.

Hypocritical people need to be called out. She should be embarassed, so don\u2019t feel bad. She inconvienences you, then gaslights you into thinking she would\u2019ve done it while also ignoring your requests for her to do it.

Keep recording her bad behavior.", "[deleted]", "This! OP is NTA! \n\nRecording someone against their knowledge can be illegal in some places, so if you want to do it again make sure you're legally OK.\n\nWith that said, the only reason your sister is offended by you recording her is that she can't say she never said that like she used to do before (I'm assuming) because you have the proof, so she gets pissed she got caught. I'm sure she does it to get away with her actions like she doesn't want to was the pan, she'll say don't rush me when you need it, just to seem like she doesn't want to do it but you need it now and end up washing it for her, then she gets mad because you washed it for her when in reality she's only mad because she got caught being lazy and not wanting to do it when you needed the pan.", "I agree nta, but i disagree with the laziness part. Imo, her behavior sounds identical to that of mine and some of my friends before being treated for depression and adhd. Lazy people aren't bothered by their own actions,  but people who are struggling with mental health issues are often incrediby frustrated by the difficulties they make for themselves.", "How was her privacy violated here, exactly? He recorded something she was saying to him, and then played it back to her. The only people who heard the recording were them. Nothing \u2018private\u2019 was revealed to anyone who wasn\u2019t already fully aware of what happened.", "It's also OPs home though? They're brother and sister, and from the context of the post, they live together under the same roof. OP is recording audio only with the intention of playing it back to his sister as a learning moment, it's nothing really nefarious", "It's only illegal if it's used against you in a formal, legal way.  It's not illegal unless it's published.  You can show someone their own recording as long as it isn't posted.\n\nIn one's own home, one resident can consent to recording within the home without informing the other residents or visitors, like a nanny cam-you don't have to inform guests.", "If she was just lazy she wouldn't complain when he does it for her. It sounds a lot like OP is leaving out the part where he or someone else in the house possibly has a history of berating her for having to clean up after her so she insists on doing it herself but struggles with time management or executive dysfunction.", "There are some places if the party being recorded isn't aware it's being recorded for any reason it's illegal... not that she'll report it, but she seems crazy enough.", "NTA, but you should have a sit down with your sister.  Apologize for hurting her feelings, but tell her you are tired of her giving you 'no win' scenarios.  Either she cleans after herself or asks others to help.  Also with the car, she either moves it when necessary or doesn't mind if someone moves it for her.  She needs to modify her behavior or else you will completely start ignoring her comments about your actions.", "NTA. If you want to amuse yourself some more, take a page from litigation lawyers and get her to really commit before playing the recording. Like you do the dishes, she says you could have asked, you tell her you did ask, and she says no you didn't. You say are you sure about that? And when she says yes, you pull out your phone and play the recording. Pretty soon, you wont have to record her and play it anymore because the second she denies reality all you'll have to do is ask her if she's sure and reach for your pocket and she will cave. Eventually she will stop messing with you altogether. It is a solid training technique.", "I think recording is wrong when you go into it with an agenda or push people to say things. If it's just unprompted behavior it's really just a great quality memory. You are responsible for your words and actions even if you end up regretting them. This is what you said and how you said it. If you would behave differently because you are being recorded that is pretty clear evidence you don't believe in your own actions. NTA", "NTA. You wanna pruf to what se said and does, so if se dont likes, she can change", "NTA. Your sister needs to confront her hypocrisy.", "NTA - NTA - NTA  \n\n\nYour sister has a control issue, loves being mad, and inconveniencing people. That's what this is really about. No matter what you do, she'll be mad. But she knows she's inconveniencing people and enjoys the control she has over others. This whole \"wait until I leave if you need to go somewhere\" statement proves this. Even if you needed to leave right away, she would make you late. And she has absolutely no desire to change her behavior to prevent your inconvenience, or her anger, which tells me she loves both.  \n\n\nBe careful about the recording. Find out the recording laws in your state. A lot of states have a one-person consent law, which means if you are part of the conversation, you can record it. And if you are in a one-person consent state, to tell her that since she gets mad at you for not liking being inconvenienced by her behavior, you fully plan on CYA'ing, which means recording these conversations. You'd rather her be mad at you for something you did, than being mad at you for HER ACTIONS.", "NAH. \n\nDoes your sister have ADHD? It could be that she really genuinely does intend to clean the dishes, and that\u2019s why she gets upset when you do it first. She knows she \u201cshould have\u201d done them, and she\u2019s ashamed\u2026 and shame easily becomes anger.", "INFO:\n\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish?  Are you hoping she'll suddenly have an epiphany and change her ways?\n\nHere's a hint: you can't control her actions, feelings, anything at all to do with her.  Just yourself.\n\nGo read 'When I Say No, I Feel Guilty.'  Learn how to assert yourself and get what you want without needing to be 'right' or her to be 'wrong.'", "I would recommend you read a book called \"The Four Tendencies\" - because your sister sounds like a \"classic\" Rebel. The tagline for a rebel? 'No one can tell me what to do, not even me.' They are the type of person who tends to never do anything they \"are supposed to\" for a lot of reasons spelled out in the book. One of the key things I love about this book is that it has whole sections on \"how to live with/manage/motivate\" a person based on their tendency. It's been a big help for me with people like your sister. Understanding that even they don't quite know why they make their and everyone around them lives difficult can mean I can take out \"do it to annoy me\" and focus on the goal of \"getting something done or communicated\". It might help.", "Exactly. Is it gentle and kind? No. Should you use it when something less confrontational would work instead? Of course not. But she didn't leave you a choice. You apparently have tried these things and she has shown they don't work. I agree with other commenters that perhaps some executive function issues complicate sister's life. Perhaps familial support would help or is needed. However, as someone with similar difficulties, not being held accountable doesn't help her either. And he tried to do so. And if she gaslights (yes, even nice people with issues gaslight when defensive and ashamed) when being held accountable, and by being dismissive or disrespectful to boot - she needs to be called on it. At that point, she is being intentionally coercive to discourage being held accountable. That part shows awareness at least where consequences are concerned. So that part is a choice on some level. Which she has a proven history of doing repeatedly. She is using manipulative behaviors and is ignoring healthy responses. What comes after that? Bottom lines can get ugly, but enabling doesn't do anyone any good. NTA\nTldr: she couldn't or didn't or wouldn't hear the nicer ways of telling her. Either way, she then invalidated OP when he held her accountable. With a history of doing so, without gaining healthier skills to cope. So he held her accountable in an undeniableway. NTA", "I am stuck in a no win situation where the \"blame\" is on me. With the dishes if I tell her I cleaned then she is mad. If I ask her to wash them she is mad. So I just simply don't answer and play the audio", "My dude, you are, in fact, not stuck in a no-win situation.  Go read the book."]}
