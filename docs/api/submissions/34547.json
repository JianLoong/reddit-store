The wedding will not be any time soon as they are not yet engaged and are in poor financial condition. Still, they are both dreamers and like to talk about and make plans for things far into the future.\n   Everything was going fine and the conversation was very pleasant. We discussed the typical things like what kind of flowers they would like, what season the wedding would be held in, and so on. Then we got to the topic of attire. My mother made it very clear that she would like her bridesmaids to wear short dresses with floral designs. She immediately looked towards me as she knew I would be against wearing a dress for multiple personal reasons. \n   At first I thought she was going to say that of course I wouldn\u2019t have to wear one and that we would find a matching alternative but she just kept staring. So I spoke up and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear a dress.\u201d She went on to say how it was her dream wedding and that I would essentially ruin the vision. I listed off multiple alternatives such as a pantsuit, tuxedo, anything but a dress.\n   I want to make it clear that I am willing to wear any color, pattern, design, etc, just not something that opens at the bottom like a dress or skirt. My mom\u2019s happiness and her wedding are very important to me but I cannot shift my boundaries on this. My sister says that I\u2019m stubborn and selfish. She says I should have no problem just wearing a dress for a few hours but I do. My family knows why I have this boundary and I thought they would be more understanding.

You could wear an overskirt over the pantsuit. You could wear those wide-legged flared pants, that give the illusion of being a skirt when your legs are together. It\u2019s sad that she\u2019s not open to even discussing other options.\n\nWhatever the reasons for your boundary, your mom knows it much better than we do and she needs to respect it.

If she really thinks that her daughter's outfit is going to ruin her vision, or happiness, or wedding, then she has some growing up to do. Especially since this isn't even a reality yet - they're not engaged and from what you said they don't have any money yet anyway. It's fine to have a vision, but it's not fine to badger you to wear something you aren't comfortable in. \n\nAt this point, I'd say that the best thing for you to do is to stop talking about it. If and when it becomes a reaity, you should step down from being a bridesmaid. If the dress is more important than your feelings, then let her have her \"perfect\" bridesmaids vision without you.", "Just curious, how do both you and your mother feel about culottes/long skorts - you know, the knee to ankle length flowing pant/skirt hybrid thing that was fashionable a few years back?

If it is not just for a comfort reason, then ybry are jerks in Hyper Drive. \n\nMy advice is just let her know directly why you won't do it, full open, and if that is still a problem then let them know that you will love being with the rest of the guests at the wedding.", "NTA.  Hey Mom, I get that you have a vision for your wedding - but if you require me to wear a dress, your vision and your dream about me and what you want me to portray about who I am is a lie - and that says a lot to me, and it hurts.  It makes me feel as though your perfect vision of me is not at all who I actually am, and that really hurts.  I\u2019m willing to make any number of accommodations here, but wearing a dress isn\u2019t one of them, and if you can\u2019t accept that, please realize that to me, this is the same thing as not accepting me for who I am.  I\u2019m not trying to hurt you, but your actions here are hurting me.", "Tell your mother that you love her and are happy for her marriage, but you will not be a bridesmaid in a dress.

You don't wear skirts/dresses, they all know this, and STILL your mom has some \"vision\" of a \"dream wedding\" that involves violating your boundaries? Mom needs to get a new vision.\n\nIn my opinion there's waaaaaaayyyyyyyy too much emphasis placed on \"making the perfect wedding\" and not nearly enough thought and effort into \"making a good marriage\" anyway.", "NTA Her vision is just that a vision. She can daydream all she wants.", "Normally I'm all for appeasing what is considered a minor request however as I personally cannot stand to wear shorts or skirts above the knee in public due to being overweight with psoriasis, I understand having that boundary and sticking to it. Even if I wore something at the request of anfriend/family member I wouldn't be able to turn off my brain to really concentrate on anything other that anxiety. I'd try but fail.\nThis isn't a case of, oh the outfit the bride chose for the party to wear is ugly/atrocious, let's grin and bear it. It is a comfort issue. OP hasn't gone into the specifics of why, which is her right, but has pointed out it is a known boundary. \n\nWhy would anyone want someone to be so uncomfortable at their wedding? With this level of discomfort already established; even if OP caved and wore it, that's all that would be on her mind through an entire ceremony, the photos, and possibly the reception.  You know if it's demanded for the wedding, they'll insist for the reception as well. Why would anyone want to look at a photo looking back on the wedding knowing how uncomfortable/miserable the person in the photo is? When I look back at pictures of events I want to remember the fun we had and the joy being together gave us. \nNTA OP. If your mom has a set requirement for being a bridesmaid that you cannot comfortably meet, it's just like being asked to be a bridesmaid when you can't afford it. You say \"I love you and will be there to support this change in your life but I can't stand up with you. It's not fair knowing that all I will think about is how uncomfortable I'll be instead of being able to concentrate on and support you.\"", "I'm going to go against the grain a little bit. NAH. I don't think that your Mom should pressure you into wearing a dress if that makes you uncomfortable. But I can also understand her wanting her bridal party to match. So you have a few options here. 1) Don't be in the wedding party and just attend as a guest. 2) Wear a dress but make it as comfortable as possible. I used to hate wearing dresses until I unlocked the secret to them. Wearing a dress can be extremely comfortable IF you find the right thing to wear underneath. Bicycle shorts under a dress is the BEST thing ever. My thighs don't rub together and the flowy fabric of a dress is actually light and airy and oh so nice especially on very hot days. I live in dresses now. Good luck.", "NTA. I wear dresses. I wouldn't wear anything above the knee for anyone. \n\nThe \"my vision for my wedding\" talk is overblown to ridiculous proportions. If anything, we should be leaning more to a \"the people in my wedding are individuals I love not dolls I use as props\" mentality.\n\nYour mom can dictate what her bridesmaids wear, but you are not compled to be a bridesmaid. If her \"wedding vision\" is that important, she won't mind that you aren't in the lineup.

And I don\u2019t know your situation as to why you do not want to wear a dress, but it\u2019s the same for you, you have to decide which is more important to you.", "Then don\u2019t be in the pretend wedding if you don\u2019t want to wear a dress lol", "ESH.

I guess I know the event is going to happen eventually and I don\u2019t want to hype her up to me wearing a dress when I know I just won\u2019t be able to do it when the time comes. I really wish I could and I want to make my mom happy but this is something I just can\u2019t do and she knows it. Thank you for taking the time to comment, I really appreciate it. I guess I\u2019m just trying to find a balance between picking my battles but also not being a pushover which I\u2019ve struggled with in the past", "Yes, the mother is absolutely selfish and stubborn.", "Yes, the mother is being selfish and stubborn! Totally right.", "Sorry \u2026why stress about\u2026.", "Not knowing what your history is, I don\u2019t know if this is helpful or not, but shorts under the dress are also an option. My girls do that a lot so they can still do gymnastics through the house and flip upside down on the playground without showing their underwear.", "I like wearing biker shorts under dresses. Maybe you could get some made in the same print as the dress?", "This is an example: https://www.jjshouse.com/jumpsuit-pantsuit-v-neck-floor-length-chiffon-bridesmaid-dress-with-ruffle-007288312-g288312?currency=USD&utm\\_term=288312&utm\\_size=22&country=US&is\\_plus\\_size=1&country=US&currency=USD&ggntk=x&ggkey=&ggtgt=7&ggplm=&gad\\_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtOmsBhCnARIsAGPa5ybcUrQdev0Yx3zRbGWVpt5HG6ZLFEEsBPdKtzAjW00H1oy-5GzgvisaAvkMEALw\\_wcB", "This could be a suitable compromise. Culottes for bridesmaids and brides do exist, so there should definitely be possibilities here.", "I would look into rompers. They would be perfect! I have a  floral and white one thatlooks like a dress. It has a full skirt and looks like a tennis dress style but fancy. I wore it to my sister's elopement at the courthouse. Even tho it mostly floral since it  had some white I did send pictures and she loved it. You can tell your mom that it would be easier for bridesmaids to dance and more comfortable. Bonus is maybe she can find a solid one for the reception to dance in too", "A skort would also be possible.  Looks like a skirt but it is shorts.", "Also, check out overskirts. They go on over something else like leggings or shorts or pants or whatever.", "Find some beautiful alternatives to show her.", "Ask her about a pantsuit with a removable train behind that could clip into a skirt for photos? Random as thought but could work? Totally understand that you have that firm boundary and your family should respect that", "In middle school I had a uniform. When it was warm I wore shorts under my skirt. There was one girl who refused to wear a skirt and nobody cared.", "Ahh, I feel for you. I was told I couldn\u2019t have my dreadlocks, and to wear a dress or skirt to a particular wedding. So I went short back and sides, a flattop and a tight long skirt with leather buckles up the back", "There are a lot of the romper styles that look like dresses until you get up close. I actually have a few that hubby thought were dresses until he saw me chasing the kids without the \"skirt\" flying everywhere.\n\nSomething like that might even be an option if you are OK with looser flowy pants.\n\nAnother option like someone else said would be an overskirt over your pants or even a romper style like I suggested.", "Would you be able (or willing) to wear some shorts under the dress?", "If it\u2019s a comfort thing, rather than an appearance thing, could you wear bike shorts underneath? They wouldn\u2019t show if the dress is flowy", "I would add this info to your post - it really changes the game imo. If your reasons were strictly fashion-based, I'd say it would be a small kindness to do it for your mom (some of the bridesmaid's dresses I've worn have been pretty . . . not my first choice, let's say that!). But with trauma being a factor, that's a whole different scenario. \n\nI'm so sorry for what you've endured.", "I feel like OP is trans or nonbinary and the family either doesn't understand or doesn't accept it", "Right? Why would you want your loved one to feel so deeply uncomfortable on such a special day that\u2019s meant to be a celebration of love? NTA", "I've worn dumber things for dumber reasons. Including a princess dress for my daughter.\n\nIt's OK to be uncomfortable for someone else every now and then. If you spend your life doing it, then there's a problem.", "Only a selfish and entitled person would be so set on their wardrobe boundaries to make it such a problem. You are aiming at the wrong person.", "Would wearing something like shorts under the dress be an option? Even if it's just for ceremony in pictures and you change into something else for the reception?", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that.", "No, you\u2019re right it\u2019s better to set the expectation now because even if it\u2019s just daydreaming when it came time she\u2019d be like \u201cbut you SAID you\u2019d wear the dress!\u201d. Plus now she has some time to reconcile that before it happens. And honestly if one AFAB person not wearing a dress can ruin her wedding she perhaps shouldn\u2019t be having one.", "I *always* wear shorts under a dress or skirt and I have since I was a kid. My ex thought it was stupid and I remember saying \u201cWhat if I want to get on the ground and play with a cute dog?\u201d And he replied \u201cWell, just don\u2019t do that\u201d and was like \u201cwelp, I fucking hate you now.\u201d \n \nI work with kids and the vast majority of them wear shorts under their skirts. Even at like 10-11. I\u2019ve heard girls give other girls a hard time for *not* wearing shorts under skirts or dresses. What if they want to jump off the top of the monkey bars? What if they wanna do cartwheels? Or climb a tree? What if they eat shit in the hallway and their dress flies up? Kids are fucking mean and would definitely make fun of you if everyone saw your underwear.", "My granddaughter is a livewire who is always doing cartwheels and head stands. She wears shorts under all dresses", "That is gorgeous \u2764\ufe0f", "That's gorgeous and the variety of available colors is impressive!", "That is really nice", "True it could be a suitable compromise - however it's important to say that OP, if they know this is something you never do and which would make you feel uneasy then it's sad they're asking you to do that. Hopefully there's a best of both worlds solution - you sound very reasonable and eager to resolve this - but to be clear they're AH for even asking. If I'd a friend I wanted in my wedding for whom this was a boundary, I'd go for pant suit the same colour as the dresses - it could be a cute contrast.", "Ah yes! The mullet of fashion, party skirt from the front, business shorts in the back. Lol", "Yes! They\u2019re full on trickery! My sister wears them to every fancy function.", "It\u2019s like, still a dress/skirt tho. I think it\u2019s less about the area being open and more about the principle. \n\nBut I\u2019ll advocate for shorts under dresses til the day I die.", "That\u2019s a big assumption. I\u2019m a cishet woman who has never enjoyed wearing dresses", "That\u2019s pretty bad ass\n Not gonna lie.", "Absolutely not. These boundaries from OP sound well established. So only the most selfish person would demand something against those boundaries. \n\nA person isn't an ornament for someone else's event. Full stop.", "It was called to my attention, I hope it\u2019s not an issue as it would be a perfect solution. I\u2019m going to bring it up to my mom and I\u2019ll post an update after", "It\u2019s ok, thank you for your concern and for taking the time to comment, much love", "I *now* wear shorts under my skirts after the wind caught my skirt and I flashed the entire school I work at.", "I wear bike shorts under my dresses all the time and I'm a 40+ adult.

Also, NTA.", "This is exactly why I bought my daughters skorts, and will refuse proper skirts for them. They are athletic, always bouncing and flipping and twisting. Skorts are amazing for them.", "Back in high-school the girls would wear bike shorts or boxers under their skirts", "I have thicc thighs, so wearing shorts under dresses is the only way I'm comfortable in the summer.", "I'm forever afraid I will get in a Miranda style situation where my clothes will get shut in the taxi door as it drives away or caught in the escalator and torn off leaving me exposed \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI ONLY wear shorts all year round and also wear a singlet under my tops... I cannot imagine just wearing a tee shirt over my bra like FUCK NO", "Mary O used to show the boys her underwear at recess. \n\nI wonder where she is now?", "Yeah, it is pretty grim that OP's mother can't respect OP's boundary. I agree with everything you say here.", "Yeah I hate dresses. Always have since 1st grade when the boys would flip up my dress and my mom continued to make me wear one at least once a week. I own 2 dresses for special occasions and a pair of spandex shorts I wear underneath.", "She thought it was great seeing a 37 year old man with a beard wear a princess dress for her princess party.\n\nAnything for my girls. (I now have 3)", "On that same note, wearing something for one day doesn't define who you are as a person. Two of my best friends are Persian and Indian (one each.) I wore some wild shit to be a part of their weddings. But you know what, it was one day. And everyone, at both weddings, were elated that I agreed to it.\n\nIt's OK to be selfless. Regardless of your reasons. It's not always about you.", "I was also going to suggest shorts underneath. I disliked dresses hard when I was younger, my tastes have changed and I am open to wearing dresses now but I will not wear one without shorts. Far more comfortable", "My cousin wore a wedding outfit that was wide-legged pants, but even though I knew in advance that she wasn't wearing a dress for her wedding when I saw it in the changing room I was confused because it looked like a dress on the hanger.  It also looks like a dress in a lot of the pictures, depending on how she's standing.  Maybe finding something like that will be a compromise that works for you and your mother.", "You could just refuse to be a bridesmaid. Otherwise maybe just don't tell her about wearing shorts underneath, she'll likely veto it because aesthetics from the sound of it.

It\u2019s irrational cuz I wear shorts, but man, I would just curl up and fucking die.", "Yeah, when a toddler pulls on your skirt and keeps pulling... always shorts or leggings from then on. Sometimes that is also my only way to have pockets.", "I work in a daycare and wear shorts under all my shorter dresses and skirts \ud83d\ude05 it\u2019s easier to stop kids from pulling up my longer clothing items", "This was my kid until she hit high school.  When she outgrew kids sizes, I was able to still find them at Academy in the Tennis and Golf sections.  Bonus for the tennis skirts is they usually have a pocket.", "My friends and I did, too! All of them. Except for the one slutty rebellious friend who wore a g string under her plaid very very mini mini skirts cuz she was going for the \u201cporn star roleplaying as a school girl\u201d look.

I think that changes things", "Nice for you. Has nothing to do with OP. \nWe don't know if it's trauma related, identity related, or a physical discomfort issue. \n\nWhat matters most in the overall story is that OP's mom is fully aware, and is a selfish B for pushing that boundary.\n\nETA: or perhaps OP should simply decline the invitation altogether.", "It was so embarrassing and can I tell you, third graders never forget that. Can\u2019t remember their vocab, but their minds are a steel trap for something like this.", "A pocket, you say?! Sign me up.", "I can't imagine that OP's mom would have her biological son wear a dress. My guess is, OP is a biological woman.", "Declining would be best.", "Dude. Tell me about it. They don\u2019t know how to sit in a chair, but they do know how to cut you deep.", "But it wouldn\u2019t be the same then. Yea she expects her daughter to wear a dress but she isn\u2019t comfortable..maybe cause of her sexuality. Maybe she would rather wear a tux or a Hawaiian shirt. \u2026lmao. \n\nHonestly idk who is the asshole anymore. The wedding seems more like a dream. Maybe OP won\u2019t even have to worry about it. Maybe their plans fall through lol", "I guess her mom would feel better about her daughter not even being a guest than her being dressed comfortably.
