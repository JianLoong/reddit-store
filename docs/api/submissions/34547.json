The wedding will not be any time soon as they are not yet engaged and are in poor financial condition. Still, they are both dreamers and like to talk about and make plans for things far into the future.\n   Everything was going fine and the conversation was very pleasant. We discussed the typical things like what kind of flowers they would like, what season the wedding would be held in, and so on. Then we got to the topic of attire. My mother made it very clear that she would like her bridesmaids to wear short dresses with floral designs. She immediately looked towards me as she knew I would be against wearing a dress for multiple personal reasons. \n   At first I thought she was going to say that of course I wouldn\u2019t have to wear one and that we would find a matching alternative but she just kept staring. So I spoke up and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear a dress.\u201d She went on to say how it was her dream wedding and that I would essentially ruin the vision. I listed off multiple alternatives such as a pantsuit, tuxedo, anything but a dress.\n   I want to make it clear that I am willing to wear any color, pattern, design, etc, just not something that opens at the bottom like a dress or skirt. My mom\u2019s happiness and her wedding are very important to me but I cannot shift my boundaries on this. My sister says that I\u2019m stubborn and selfish. She says I should have no problem just wearing a dress for a few hours but I do. My family knows why I have this boundary and I thought they would be more understanding.

You could wear an overskirt over the pantsuit. You could wear those wide-legged flared pants, that give the illusion of being a skirt when your legs are together. It\u2019s sad that she\u2019s not open to even discussing other options.\n\nWhatever the reasons for your boundary, your mom knows it much better than we do and she needs to respect it. If she needs all of her bridesmaids to wear dresses, then she needs to come to terms with the fact that you won\u2019t be a bridesmaid.

If she really thinks that her daughter's outfit is going to ruin her vision, or happiness, or wedding, then she has some growing up to do. Especially since this isn't even a reality yet - they're not engaged and from what you said they don't have any money yet anyway. It's fine to have a vision, but it's not fine to badger you to wear something you aren't comfortable in. \n\nAt this point, I'd say that the best thing for you to do is to stop talking about it. If and when it becomes a reaity, you should step down from being a bridesmaid. If the dress is more important than your feelings, then let her have her \"perfect\" bridesmaids vision without you.", "Just curious, how do both you and your mother feel about culottes/long skorts - you know, the knee to ankle length flowing pant/skirt hybrid thing that was fashionable a few years back?

The solution is simple: don\u2019t be a bridesmaid.", "NTA maybe I'm wrong here, but if you read between the lines, I'm going to guess that isn't JUST a comfort boundary. Though, you have no obligation to share more. Because even if it was just a  comfort thing, they are sorta being jerks about it by not communicating in a healthy manner. If it is not just for a comfort reason, then ybry are jerks in Hyper Drive. \n\nMy advice is just let her know directly why you won't do it, full open, and if that is still a problem then let them know that you will love being with the rest of the guests at the wedding.", "NTA.  Hey Mom, I get that you have a vision for your wedding - but if you require me to wear a dress, your vision and your dream about me and what you want me to portray about who I am is a lie - and that says a lot to me, and it hurts.  It makes me feel as though your perfect vision of me is not at all who I actually am, and that really hurts.  I\u2019m willing to make any number of accommodations here, but wearing a dress isn\u2019t one of them, and if you can\u2019t accept that, please realize that to me, this is the same thing as not accepting me for who I am.  I\u2019m not trying to hurt you, but your actions here are hurting me.", "Tell your mother that you love her and are happy for her marriage, but you will not be a bridesmaid in a dress.

You don't wear skirts/dresses, they all know this, and STILL your mom has some \"vision\" of a \"dream wedding\" that involves violating your boundaries? Mom needs to get a new vision.\n\nIn my opinion there's waaaaaaayyyyyyyy too much emphasis placed on \"making the perfect wedding\" and not nearly enough thought and effort into \"making a good marriage\" anyway.", "NTA Her vision is just that a vision. She can daydream all she wants.", "Normally I'm all for appeasing what is considered a minor request however as I personally cannot stand to wear shorts or skirts above the knee in public due to being overweight with psoriasis, I understand having that boundary and sticking to it. Even if I wore something at the request of anfriend/family member I wouldn't be able to turn off my brain to really concentrate on anything other that anxiety. I'd try but fail.\nThis isn't a case of, oh the outfit the bride chose for the party to wear is ugly/atrocious, let's grin and bear it. It is a comfort issue. OP hasn't gone into the specifics of why, which is her right, but has pointed out it is a known boundary. \n\nWhy would anyone want someone to be so uncomfortable at their wedding? With this level of discomfort already established; even if OP caved and wore it, that's all that would be on her mind through an entire ceremony, the photos, and possibly the reception.  You know if it's demanded for the wedding, they'll insist for the reception as well. Why would anyone want to look at a photo looking back on the wedding knowing how uncomfortable/miserable the person in the photo is? When I look back at pictures of events I want to remember the fun we had and the joy being together gave us. \nNTA OP. If your mom has a set requirement for being a bridesmaid that you cannot comfortably meet, it's just like being asked to be a bridesmaid when you can't afford it. You say \"I love you and will be there to support this change in your life but I can't stand up with you. It's not fair knowing that all I will think about is how uncomfortable I'll be instead of being able to concentrate on and support you.\"", "I'm going to go against the grain a little bit. NAH. I don't think that your Mom should pressure you into wearing a dress if that makes you uncomfortable. But I can also understand her wanting her bridal party to match. So you have a few options here. 1) Don't be in the wedding party and just attend as a guest. 2) Wear a dress but make it as comfortable as possible. I used to hate wearing dresses until I unlocked the secret to them. Wearing a dress can be extremely comfortable IF you find the right thing to wear underneath. Bicycle shorts under a dress is the BEST thing ever. My thighs don't rub together and the flowy fabric of a dress is actually light and airy and oh so nice especially on very hot days. I live in dresses now. Good luck.", "NTA. I wear dresses. I wouldn't wear anything above the knee for anyone. \n\nThe \"my vision for my wedding\" talk is overblown to ridiculous proportions. If anything, we should be leaning more to a \"the people in my wedding are individuals I love not dolls I use as props\" mentality.\n\nYour mom can dictate what her bridesmaids wear, but you are not compled to be a bridesmaid. If her \"wedding vision\" is that important, she won't mind that you aren't in the lineup.

And I don\u2019t know your situation as to why you do not want to wear a dress, but it\u2019s the same for you, you have to decide which is more important to you.", "Then don\u2019t be in the pretend wedding if you don\u2019t want to wear a dress lol", "ESH.

Or if it's a tighter outfit, you can pair with higher shorts where the pocket is above the skirt line, and it looks like you are just pulling your skirt up. Also, to get the item, just run your hand over the pocket and lift the item up, then have it slide down your leg to your foot to bent and pick it up.", "I think that\u2019s what they did in the old days.
