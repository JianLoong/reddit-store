You should apologize and maybe you could offer to just go buy the correct items?", "YTA\n\nSo you have been living with them for 2 months, and friends for presumably a lot longer, and you didn't even know if they were kosher Jews or not? You've never brought your own food into the house in 2 months? Never helped out with groceries at all??

You never saw the other products in her house and you think it is ok when she gave you strict instruction where to get the stuff .

You just were lazy and thought why should I drive around time when I can get it easier but not what your friend needed . And 6 months and not looking for your own place ? how long did you plan to stay. It was not a favour , you help out in the house when you stay there what I assume was mostly free . I'm surprised that it was the first time she asked you to get something and you never went shopping together in this 6 months", "So you apparently know she has autism. You know they are Jewish. You get an exact description of what to buy but instead of looking up where you have to go to or at least saying \"Sorry, I don't know where the shop you mean is, can you show me next time?\" you decide to get something else and after that you have the audacity to call what you did a favour while they do you the huge favour of not letting you become homeless?\n\nDid I get that right?\n\nOf course YTA", "YTA. You were given a list with detailed instructions. If you didn't want, or could not, comply with such instructions you should have raised it with her rather than mindlessly substituting items.

And, possibly, read more before deciding you know enough about it.", "YTA.\n\nElizabeth took the time to write a detailed list so it was clearly important to her that you get the specific products she asked for and she went to great lengths to give you all the instructions. If you didn\u2019t understand it you should have asked rather than assume. Also, how hard is it to find a place online or even ask about it? You were just lazy. \n\nYou\u2019ve been staying in their space because they have were kind enough to help you out and you were asked to respect that space with regards to the food and contribute by taking the time to get it and you did neither.", "Yeah, YTA\n\nShe gave you specific instructions. You should have called or asked if they didn't have stuff\n\nKosher is a serious religious requirement, and you sounded very dismissive and disrespectful. They were doing YOU a favor to let you stay there.", "YTA- these people took you in and are being so kind but you decided that the requests she made aren\u2019t worth your effort?! It\u2019s called plugging the name into your phone for directions or looking it up before you leave the house. You should have offered to buy the damn groceries from the beginning- you picking up the wrong groceries is not a favor! Now she has to buy new ones and she\u2019s out time and more money. What is wrong with you?! Get your shit together, pay for the groceries, apologize to your friend and her husband, and hope that they might speak to you again someday. I know I wouldn\u2019t bother with you anymore.", "YTA. She gave you very specific instructions beforehand. You are staying at HER house, and SHE asked you to buy groceries.\n\nIf you wanted to buy different things from what she requested, you should have consulted her beforehand. Delivery services have that option, you know \u2014 while you consider Elizabeth your FRIEND.\n\nI understand why she asked you to take the animal products out of the house.

Which is a LOT more than just not eating shellfish or pork... meat and dairy are not served at the same meal, many will have two sets of cookware, two sets of dining ware and I've seen instances where a family will have two separate kitchens because meat and dairy are not prepared or served together. \n\n You spent the money you were handed to use to purchase Kosher groceries to buy non-Kosher foods and don't see why you need to give that money back to your friend... in fact, you want HER to pay YOU for doing her the \"favor\" of bringing trayf food into her home, contaminating her kitchen and you come running to Reddit to ask AITA?  \n\n\n**YTA**", "YTA. You didn't \"do her a favour,\" you threw her money away on food she can't eat because you were too lazy to look up an address. So now she doesn't have the money or the food. How is that a favour?", "YTA. She gave you a list and money, so you had no right to go and buy whatever you saw fit.\nIf you had doubts or trouble going, you could have asked them for help, use google maps to find the locations or refuse.\nYou also had a cellphone, so you could have called them and ask if it was ok to buy something different, since you knew they are Jewish.\nYour friend was greaceful enough to give you a roof on your head and you acted like an ungrateful brat.\nThey deserve an apology after helping you out, especially when your own family is not so happy to have you around.", "YTA. You were given a home and you repaid this generosity by wasting her money on products she didn't want. You were asked to get specific items from specific shops, if this wasn't possible you should have said no. You may as well have flushed her money down the toilet.\n\n>I did her a favour\n\nNo you didn't. None of what you did was the least bit helpful. You know what is helpful? Buying the products you were asked to buy.", "On the bright side, your \"friend\" was probably happy to have an excuse to finally get you out of  their house. \n\nTwo months is a very long time to host a non contributing guest.", "Don't you have Google Maps where you live? It should'nt be too hard to find the right shops, I guess. She gave you a very specific list and told you to follow it. If you didn't know why, you could have asked. If you didn't wanted to follow such strict rules, you could have discussed this before. Why don't you communicate and just do what is convenient for you? YTA", "Yes YTA You were very presumptive about her list and degrading about her being autistic. Instead of asking her if you could get these items elsewhere you took it upon yourself to take the lazy way out. If she specifically mentioned locations and/or brands, did it not occur to you there was a reason for it. If she just wanted milk, she would have written milk, not a brand. Not only did you dismiss her religious beliefs, but you refused to reimburse her for YOUR mistake. Yet she is housing you. Unbelievable.", "YTA. How shitty a friend are you that you didn't realize she kept kosher? How oblivious are you to have not noticed?", "I don't think you are the AH for trying to be resourceful by trying to find food items that would fit your friends requests even though it isn't exactly what she asked for. YTA because when the reasoning was explained you didn't own up to your mistake. You didn't do her a favour if you didn't actually get any of the food she needed.", "YTA. Stick to the list! If you make any changes, ask. \n\nYou\u2019re on the way out of this house too if your disrespect continues", "YTA.  Of  course you owe her the money you spent. What would make you think it is right to buy things she can't eat with her money and not pay her back? You sound very self centered. You should have given her money back or went and bought the right things. You are not a good friend.", "YTA. Not sure what\u2019s so hard to grasp. She asked for specific things for a reason.", "YTA you should have asked if there is suitable alternatives", "Yes, YTA. Your friend asked for items from very specific stores, and rather than googling where the shops were you bought the wrong things from the wrong store. You didn\u2019t even try to get the specific items that Elizabeth asked for. To her, you basically showed that you don\u2019t care about something that is really important to her and her partner.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t give you specific instructions for the fun of it. She trusted you, you wasted her money and you are now refusing to repay her.", "Obviously you didn\u2019t know fully what she couldn\u2019t have and she could\u2019ve specified what the reason for it was before you went shopping but I don\u2019t think you was right to tell her you did her a favour when she cannot condone these things in her house due to her religion also even if she didn\u2019t tell you why she wanted it from different shops you should\u2019ve still done it or asked her why first so you knew maybe you should apologise because personally I don\u2019t think she overreacted", "YTA hugely.

You're being both antisemitic AND ableist in one post here and you're not getting any sympathy from anyone.\n\nYou're a guest in someone else's home, someone who was generous enough to open their home for you to prevent you from apparent homelessness (which seems to be a lie, as you've easily ended up staying with your brother instead). When being a guest in someone else's home, you follow their rules, religious or otherwise. She wasn't demanding you convert to Judaism, nor attend synagogue with you.

I get that traditionally Jewish people don't eat pork because they perceive pigs as unclean, but there isn't anything unsanitary about pork if it is stored properly. Most Jewish people nowadays probably don't have any issue with unkosher foods because of sanitary reasons, they are likely just following their religious beliefs. I thought It might be alright to keep foods that aren't kosher in the house and it was just a personal preference of Elizabeths rather than her religious beliefs preventing anything unkosher being in the house. I was just curious if you knew anything more about this, I wasn't trying to offend you.", "Didn't realize people had to go through such lengths to keep kosher. I always just thought they had to make sure they didn't eat any unkosher foods. Thanks for enlightening me.", "It generally doesn\u2019t require a rabbi.  People can kasher (make kosher) their own home without the assistance of a rabbi if they have taken the time to learn how to kasher things.\n\nPeople who keep kosher typically kasher their own kitchens at least once a year for Passover.\n\nBut depending on the materials used, bringing non kosher food into a kosher kitchen can cause great expense if it comes into contact with materials that cannot be kashered.  Like, in a clay/porcelain casserole dish or a plates, etc.\n\nIn addition to losing the food, you can also lose the equipment.  It sucks.", "At this point in the thread this comment has raised several eyebrows about the level of your blatant stupidity.", "She was such a crabby roommate that she also lobster friend.", "Some Jewish people probably don\u2019t keep kosher, but there are groups of Jewish people who strictly adhere every rule about food that is in the Jewish religion.

I\u2019m not Jewish, but some of my friends and coworkers are.\n\nSome will eat non-kosher meat, but won\u2019t eat a cheeseburger because one part of being kosher is not mixing meat and dairy in the same meal.\n\nSome just don\u2019t eat pork.\n\nAnd some are very kosher, to the point where I do not bring food to their house unless I check first to see if it is a meat or dairy meal, and then I buy something at a kosher restaurant or deli that I know they use and are comfortable with. We either eat at their house or we go to a kosher restaurant.", "I have a friend who keeps kosher very strictly, you have to plan your life around it to some extent.", "Add to the fact she is autistic and changing routines etc especially unexpectedly can be a very stressful", "I'm not OP, but thanks for the info. I didn't really think about cross contamination so I guess it could be considered a sanitation issue.", "It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a law issue. \n\nHi. Jewish person here. \n\nI don\u2019t keep kosher. But I grew up with my aunt keeping kosher and have learned about the reasoning behind kosher laws. \n\nEssentially keeping kosher is about ethics. Ethics pertaining to food, ethics pertaining to how one manages the home and its sometimes about \u201csanitation\u201d but only so much as it pertains to keeping milk and meat separate. \n\nKashrut or kosher laws cover everything from how one eats and separates milk and meat to how livestock and agricultural plants are grown and raised and ultimately killed or harvested. It has a lot to do with humane treatment of animals and humane practices.\n\nAnd the biggest prohibition is not mixing milk and meat as in \u201cwe don\u2019t drown a baby in its mothers milk\u201d we don\u2019t harm and disrespect the animal we are eating by eating it with the life sustaining milk. As for unkosher animals we have a set of rules about which animals are allowed to be eaten. Pigs don\u2019t fit categorically into a category that can be eaten. Neither do dogs/pets, rodents, bats, horses, etc. \n\nSo when someone brings something unkosher into a kosher home it\u2019s not about sanitation. It\u2019s about ritual purity. Everything that impure item touches needs to be made pure again which can be both expensive and sometimes given the item (like microwaves or ceramic) cannot be rekashered and instead need to be replaced. \n\nKosher food laws are about intentional eating. And OP has lived with this friend for months. Op knew this all. They\u2019re lying. You don\u2019t live in a kosher home and not know this. It\u2019s legitimately impossible to not at least have some understanding of the processes and limitations."]}
