There is zero reason for her to take up a team slot. Don't refuse because of your job, refuse because they're wrong.", "ESH, your parents should feel entitled to the same right to complain as any other parent -- neither more nor less because of your position. Here, their complaint is unreasonable, but not because of your job.", "NTA\n\nbecause it's the director's decision and your parents dont have anything to say.\n\nHowever I can not condone your little p\\*ssy behaviour, you refused because of fear (cowardice?) not by conviction.", "I do not understand this at all. While she may not be able to play and not be rostered, I do not understand why the coach cannot keep her as a non rostered player/manager until her injuries heal. The coach is taking a chance of turning off a potentially good player because she happens to be injured. She's probably got several years of eligibility.\n\nAlso, they still have 25 players left - still enough for 2 teams with just a sub or two. This sounds as if the school district is just trying to save money. And you have the backbone of a jellyfish.", "NTA - this would be an abuse of power on your part, and this is your literal workplace, like your parents need to grow up. Idk if anything has changed since I lettered in high school, but cuts like this happen all the time. It\u2019s not like your sister can play, she\u2019s injured lol she participated in season and will still letter so idk what your parents issue is. Get ahead of this tho and let your AD or boss know that call might be coming and outline whatever steps you\u2019ve taken to ward them off. Don\u2019t let them blow up your spot. \n\nWhat a terribly petty hill for them to die on. Good for you for drawing boundaries.", "NTA - regardless of why she is cut, there is nothing more pointless and obnoxious than a parent calling a coach about a kid getting cut from a team. If people don\u2019t want their kids to learn about winning and losing graciously, they shouldn\u2019t have them in sports to begin with.", "NTA go speak to the director and warn them - you show you are not agreeing with them and they won\u2019t think you are in on it.  Sadly they are probably used to dealing with parents like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can't control what they do.", "NTA. You calling would not help Jess and might hurt you. Jess would not only be injured and cut but she would be the kid with THAT family. What do you parents think would happen? The coach would cut a mother player that can playoff on that can't?", "NTA. Just ignore the whole issue. It shouldn't affect you either way.", "If the shoe was on the other foot they would be pissed if an injured player stayed on the team. NTA", "YTA.  You would be NTA if you did not want them to call because your parent's calling is probably a waste of time and it doesn't seem reasonable. But in your case you are worried about your job. It is not reasonable to decide that your parents lose all the rights of parents for the next 5 years because you work in that district.\n\nAre the other staff members really that ridiculous that they would hold this against you? Teaching in the US has so many issues but surely not? \n\nDefinitely you don't intervene ever, and it is important that your parents are not rude or abusive, but aside from that they have the right to be parents as they usually would if you were not working there.", "NTA, this is called \u201cAthletics\u201d and that means sports that have running, throwing, etc. Watching is not one of the criteria.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but if she isn\u2019t going to play and they need that spot for someone else. It is what it is. \n\nSad, but true.\n\nOn top of that your job could be involved. No way.", "NTA - What is their view that she should be on the team taking a roster spot (and weakening the team)?", "NTA - would they call if you didn\u2019t work there? Even if they would, they\u2019re being unreasonable trying to change the results of the how the team roster was selected.", "NTA lol but be prepared for them to be a little mad at you.  If they are feeling that strongly they need to call to complain about their 13 year old not making a team, chances are they won't listen to anybody else.\n\nBut coming from their oldest child!?!  Good luck. Atleast in my experience, my parents never take my advice", "This, absolutely.  I hope OP sees this.  And maybe add that it's just a heads up and OP wants no part of the drama.", "The coach doesn\u2019t want to keep her if she\u2019s not rostered because that means time and energy at practice devoted to a player that won\u2019t even play.", "Excellent point. I agree NTA. Being cut is difficult for sure, but I think it\u2019s a part of life. Athletic Director probably wouldn\u2019t do much anyway if the roster is set. But there are a lot of parents that cannot handle the reality of their children\u2019s ability. Probably a reason less people want to coach.", "We\u2019ll they think she should be doing what she has been which is going to practices and games but sitting the bench, and just not be eligible, so not take a spot, which is an option but if the coach doesn\u2019t want to have a player that can\u2019t play in games at practice then that\u2019s his decision.", "As the son of a high school coach, and who has coached youths myself, that is an absolute load of crap.\n\nAnd how in the hell do you know what the coach is thinking? You suck as a brother, btw!", "Stealing a comment in hopes you read it and can take preemptive measures: \"NTA- might be worth giving the Athletic Director a heads up about the call coming in though.\"", "So they want her to sit and watch other people play and grow stronger and not be able to take part?\n\nwhat about this helps her?", "You do realize that different places have different policies right? And that those policies are usually well known to others with vested interest? I am not sure why it is so important to you to keep an injured player who would be out for an extended period of time on the team. \n\nMy school only had active players on the roster. If a player was injured and was out for more than two months they were taken off the team. The player had to earn the spot back (not sure what that entailed)."]}
