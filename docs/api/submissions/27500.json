While she may not be able to play and not be rostered, I do not understand why the coach cannot keep her as a non rostered player/manager until her injuries heal. The coach is taking a chance of turning off a potentially good player because she happens to be injured.

Idk if anything has changed since I lettered in high school, but cuts like this happen all the time. It\u2019s not like your sister can play, she\u2019s injured lol she participated in season and will still letter so idk what your parents issue is.

You would be NTA if you did not want them to call because your parent's calling is probably a waste of time and it doesn't seem reasonable. But in your case you are worried about your job. It is not reasonable to decide that your parents lose all the rights of parents for the next 5 years because you work in that district.\n\nAre the other staff members really that ridiculous that they would hold this against you? Teaching in the US has so many issues but surely not? \n\nDefinitely you don't intervene ever, and it is important that your parents are not rude or abusive, but aside from that they have the right to be parents as they usually would if you were not working there.", "NTA, this is called \u201cAthletics\u201d and that means sports that have running, throwing, etc. Watching is not one of the criteria.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but if she isn\u2019t going to play and they need that spot for someone else.

If they are feeling that strongly they need to call to complain about their 13 year old not making a team, chances are they won't listen to anybody else.\n\nBut coming from their oldest child!?!  Good luck. Atleast in my experience, my parents never take my advice", "This, absolutely.  I hope OP sees this.  And maybe add that it's just a heads up and OP wants no part of the drama.", "The coach doesn\u2019t want to keep her if she\u2019s not rostered because that means time and energy at practice devoted to a player that won\u2019t even play.", "Excellent point. I agree NTA. Being cut is difficult for sure, but I think it\u2019s a part of life. Athletic Director probably wouldn\u2019t do much anyway if the roster is set. But there are a lot of parents that cannot handle the reality of their children\u2019s ability. Probably a reason less people want to coach.", "We\u2019ll they think she should be doing what she has been which is going to practices and games but sitting the bench, and just not be eligible, so not take a spot, which is an option but if the coach doesn\u2019t want to have a player that can\u2019t play in games at practice then that\u2019s his decision.", "As the son of a high school coach, and who has coached youths myself, that is an absolute load of crap.\n\nAnd how in the hell do you know what the coach is thinking?

And that those policies are usually well known to others with vested interest? I am not sure why it is so important to you to keep an injured player who would be out for an extended period of time on the team. \n\nMy school only had active players on the roster. If a player was injured and was out for more than two months they were taken off the team. The player had to earn the spot back (not sure what that entailed).", "(USA) INFO: The real question is, does the boys team have both varsity and JV, because if so, then they are required to fund and field equal opportunities for the girls teams.\n\nIt's inappropriate for you to use your role to advocate for only one student that is a family member. But it's not inappropriate at all for parents to ask questions about the program and their child's place in it. Especially if there are bigger justice concerns that might need to be brought to light with administration. Having a talented athlete get injured partly through the season and then cut is something that does merit a full communication with the parents so that everyone is on the same page. It's definitely in the athletic director's job to communicate when parents have questions about the program. \n\nJust stay out of it, though. Your parents are going to parent in the way they choose, and you are free to not be bothered by it or involved in any way.", "YTA whether your oarents should.or shpuld n9t call.is irrelevant. It is npne of your business.", "NTA. I think it's good advice, but hopefully the coach won't take it out on you.", "NTA, what are they even going to complain about? If she can\u2019t play they can\u2019t save a roster spot for her that would be incredibly unfair to another young woman who can play. Is their goal to raise your sister to be selfish and self centered? Because there is no other message that this can send.", "NTA\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for them to call even if you didn\u2019t work there. \n\nYour sister is injured and cannot play, insisting she remain on the varsity team is ridiculously selfish on your parents part. Plus it\u2019s not doing your sister any favours in the long run.", "NTA\n\nYour parents focus should be on your sister rehabilitation... not her inclusion on a team she can't actually play on, this season.  \n\nYour sister is 13... do your parents really want to be known as 'those parents' when it comes to sports?  It won't be a good look for them and Jess will be the one ostracised for it.\n\nThere's also more than one soccer team.  Perhaps your parents might like to attach her to a bigger team where it doesn't matter if a player is just sitting on the bench the entire season.\n\nJess doesn't really want to go to practices to see everyone else having a great time and her missing out... especially knowing that she can't play.\n\nThe only thing I would do is have her come along to support her friends at some practices (if allowed) and go to games to cheer them on.", "1.  She doesn\u2019t want the be there.  It sucks in the moment but hanging around practices when you are hurt is a boring waste of time.  Sign up for something she can do while injured.  School play (work tech), club?  Take up singing and do some lessons.  Whatever.  Use the time.  You can help her and your parents with options.  \n\n2.  13 is too young for a high school sport where she might go against 18 year olds.  Very high risk of injury.  Particularly if the players are largely unskilled.  You do not give details, but unless your sister is playing on a \u201cA\u201d ECNL u14 team she has no business being on the field.  (And even if she was, there is no way I wouldn\u2019t let her play over club ball.)\n\nThere are many years of bad high school soccer ahead for her.  No reason to worry about this one.  Maybe start thinking about winter sport tryouts.", "Definitely NTA, and it would be a great idea to let the Athletic Director know about the drama they\u2019re trying to stir up.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Theoretically one could have quit the team and signed up again the next year but that would not have been well received by teammates or coaches.\n\nPractice is about a lot more than physical activity. It's about demonstration, comraderie, team building, and showing a commitment. \n\nCoaches demonstrate things for players and you can absolutely improve simply by watching. There's a reason pro athletes spend hundreds of hours watching tape. \n\nYou also grow as a team. Being together every day builds friendship, trust, and chemistry. High school sports are as much a social activity as they are an athletic one. If she's not there every day she's going to go back next year to a group of girls who have built relationships she's not a part of. Breaking into that sort of group isn't impossible but it will be a lot harder if she's not there this year. \n\nI missed the last two months of my junior year wrestling due to a badly sprained ankle. It was one of my most valuable stretches of practice ever. Taking a step back and just watching my teammates allowed me to learn a ton. I came back as a far better wrestler as a senior. \n\nIf ops sister were taking up a spot that was needed, which is how they framed this thread, then I'd say cutting her was the right move. That said, there's no reason even then a technically \"cut\" player can't still be at practice, treated as a teammate, included in team photos, even if they aren't officially on the roster. In this case that's not even needed though. They clarified here that as an injured player ineligible to play she doesn't count for a spot anyway. The lack of spots has nothing to do with this at all. The framing here is nonsense and has nothing to do with any of it. \n\nI'll also say, op also said in a comment the coach doesn't want to \"waste time\" on a player who won't play and that's just garbage coaching as someone who has had many coaches and has coached. For one, as his sister won't be actively participating she's not taking up any significant amount of time. Her being on the sideline at practice and watching instruction takes up no time at all. What time are we talking about here? The time to say hello each day? Really?\n\nBeyond that, we're talking about a freshman, someone who can potentially be an asset for that team for another 4 years. Unless she's never going to be able to play again, time invested in her is an investment into the future of the team. Part of a coaches job is building a program, investing in the future, not just putting out the best possible team today. Yes, that will always be an important part of the job, but balancing the two is a huge part of being a coach.\n\nI had a garbage wrestling coach as a freshman. Ignored every player who wasn't on varsity. I think the guy said about 10 words to me the entire year. I struggled to transition from middle school to high school wrestling and even on JV I only won a few matches. I assume he didn't think I was worth the time. I felt so defeated I almost quit after the season. The only reason I went back as a sophomore was because my middle school coach was given the job after our old coach was encouraged to resign after a 7th straight losing season. He'd coached a couple of all state guys but could never figure out how to build a team. \n\nMy middle school coach actually called me and made sure I'd be back that year. The same kid who just went 3-21 on jv as a freshman. He spent time working with me and made every wrestler on the team feel important. I had a winning record on jv as a sophomore. As a junior I went about .500 on varsity. Senior year I was all state. That's what can happen when you invest in team building.\n\nWe also went from 7 straight losing seasons to winning our district 2 of my final 3 years and being 2 team wins from the state championship my senior year. \n\nLook, op should stay out of it. It's a conflict of interest. But their parents are not wrong to be upset. This is terrible coaching and depriving their daughter of a chance to continue growing as a player for seemingly no reason. It's the sort of situation athletic directors are supposed to get involved in.", "Yes, I do realize that. I also said they could make the sister a student manager. And not being on the active roster does not mean not being on the team. The coach was going to cut her. **There is a major difference between being on the team (even injured or inactive) and being cut.** Obviously, my experience is different from yours. And, I'm just doing what everyone else is doing here - expressing my opinion - why does that bother you?"]}
