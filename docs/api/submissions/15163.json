She should have known her own (un)availability and recounted from there.", "NTA she is now demanding 2 days from you for free babysitting. Jesus Christ the entitlement of some people.

Your sis very slightly for being upset at you for not babysitting a day you didn't agree to. Your mom for butting in and offering you to your sis on the wrong day that SHE TOLD YOU. And you to yourself for getting yourself into this situation in the first place. It's great that you agreed to babysit for her wedding. And forgetting the date happens. But you should have gotten the date from your sister herself, not your mom, when you forgot. That's where you went wrong and why YTJ. \n\nHowever, you're NTJ for wanting to not babysit on a day that's not your sister's wedding when the dates got mixed up. There's no difference than if you just happened to get an extra day off.

That thought process is unhealthy and destructive. It perpetuates a culture of mom guilt. \n\nShould moms be devoted to their children? Yes, 10,000%.

Even an hour for a pedicure makes a whole world of difference in our moods and sense of self. \n\nSo please, consider that parents are humans that also require time for self care and development.\n\nIn regards to the post, OP is NTA.
