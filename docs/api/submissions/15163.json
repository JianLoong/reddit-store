She should have known her own (un)availability and recounted from there.", "NTA she is now demanding 2 days from you for free babysitting. Jesus Christ the entitlement of some people.

That's where you went wrong and why YTJ. \n\nHowever, you're NTJ for wanting to not babysit on a day that's not your sister's wedding when the dates got mixed up.
