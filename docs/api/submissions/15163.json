And you to yourself for getting yourself into this situation in the first place. It's great that you agreed to babysit for her wedding. And forgetting the date happens. But you should have gotten the date from your sister herself, not your mom, when you forgot. That's where you went wrong and why YTJ. \n\nHowever, you're NTJ for wanting to not babysit on a day that's not your sister's wedding when the dates got mixed up.

Having a kid and then demanding your family take over your responsibilities whenever you need a break from the responsibility you chose to take on is not remotely similar.", "You can't compare a job to a child. Everyone has to have a job. No one is forced into having children.", "It\u2019s honestly absurd to interpret the statement out of context. Explain something to me. This \u201cright\u201d of the parents to have time to themselves, who should facilitate that? Who \u201cowes\u201d her this right she\u2019s entitled to according to you? The problem isn\u2019t her desire to have time to herself, it\u2019s the fact that she apparently thinks it\u2019s ok to guilt other people in her life into taking over her responsibility even after they have declined.", "Regarding your edit, I downvoted you and I'm child-free. It doesn't take an \"overworked, underappreciated\" parent to know that human beings require and deserve time to themselves.", "It was slight sarcasm in my post.  Hence putting all the blame on the mom", "I think Jerk", "You're a good person, OP,  also I don't get why everyone is hating on your sister (jeez she pushed a baby out three months ago she is probably still healing from it, and her hubby doesn't seem to help much), or for a matter of fact on your mother! So what she thought she had a \"fantastic idea\" and it's totally fine you shot it down, your life is hard too! You feeling like an AH in this situation just shows you care, you were put in this position by accident. Nobody is the AH here.", "OP, you seem like you have a really good heart. It really sounds like your mom and sister are taking advantage of your kindness here. You\u2019ve set down a totally reasonable boundary. \n\nAlso, if your sister needs help with childcare, then she needs to be more available. This is ultimately her fault for not being reachable by phone, and relying on you and her mother to sort it out for her. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s under a lot of stress, and you\u2019re being very thoughtful about that. But it\u2019s not an excuse to jerk you around, disrespect your time, and then blame you for it. And it\u2019s not an excuse for your mother to volunteer you, either. They both seem disrespectful of your time, actually. \n\nAnyway, your instinct was correct - it\u2019s absolutely reasonable for you to take back your time in April. I hope this is a one-off moment, and not a pattern of behavior from your mom and sister.", "Idk if sis was in it. I think mom doesn't want to be default babysitter and was hoping to get OP approved by adding in a date", "My manipulative mother would absolutely do this on purpose. That lady is downright offended by the concept of informed consent.", "She'll probably continue to have kids with him even knowing he's a shit dad and partner.", "You can dance around the point all you want but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that when she took on the responsibility of being a parent, she (and her partner if any) took it on alone. No one is saying it isn\u2019t hard or that she may not need a break. But it\u2019s entirely on the parent to figure it out and guilt tripping OP into losing vacation time to provide free care is not an acceptable solution. If she\u2019s not comfortable leaving the baby with a stranger, then she\u2019d better suck it up and accept that she\u2019s not getting the break when her family is unable or unwilling to do it.", "Jesus Christ, nobody is saying that you get press ganged into changing some rando's kid's diaper.", "Of course.\n\nBut to say if you wanted free time, then don't be a mother is wrong.", "Lots of people choose to have kids, but \"no one\" being forced to have children is categorically false.", "or, you know, the person asking this big favor can shoot a text to the person they are asking this of with the dates actually written down, so there is clarity.", "I kinda thought the same but was a bit confused as I've never seen it on this sub before.", "Could very well be busy with things related to the wedding. Like helping another relative with health problems so they can attend the wedding.", "[deleted]", "I read it as she needed babysitting on the days leading up to her wedding for planning, etc.", "You're not wrong, I just think we need to be kinder when it comes to the new mom's feelings about all this. She is exhausted (OP wrote later the hubby doesn't help enough) and jumped at a possible opportunity to have some time to herself (shower, eat a proper meal that kind of stuff), she can be easily forgiven for that. It's not OPs problem, she shouldn't have to take the extra day off because her life is hard too, but they are family. OP writes she gladly helps when needed, I think their relationship is good. It's only the grandma that is verging on being TA for not respecting OP's time vs. her other daughter's.", "I think in the context of the post that pretty clearly means that when you decide to become a parent you should be prepared to be frequently disappointed when it comes to having your desired free time due to not being able to get someone (paid or volunteer) to take over for you. She deserves it from her deadbeat partner but with very few exceptions, no one else owes it. OP may be kind enough to do it but it shouldn\u2019t be something her sister feels entitled to from her.", "In this case, it doesn't seem to be false.", "I'm assuming it's used by people who don't curse, kind of funny to see it used in a forum where the curse is in the title tho \ud83d\ude2d", "I gotchu", "Allow me.", "In the wrong month, that poor relative", "Unlikely. It isn't likely to be a relative's wedding if OP isn't invited.", "I thought the same thing until reading these comments. It does say \"a\" wedding, and not \"her\" wedding.

She asked me to look after the baby while she had a shower. I said \"What do I do?\" and she said \"I don't know - I've never had one before!\" :)", "it's very clear in the story - OP was sister's last option to babysit when sister goes to a wedding. but OP wasn't sure what the date was, and was given wrong info from their mom. OP and her husband have very little time off, and it's a big deal to spend a rare day off babysitting, so she is willing to do it for the wedding, but not for a bonus day in April and then again for the wedding in June.", "Haha it's kinda wholesome in a weird way.", "I know, I was just explaining how I misread it.", "Yup you figure it out the best you can. I literally dragged the bassinet into the bathroom and took a shower while occasionally talking out loud so kiddo knew I was there. \ud83d\ude02", "Haha! I agree. \u2665\ufe0f"]}
