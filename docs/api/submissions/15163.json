My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t get a big holiday allowance so he was happy to cancel his day too so he could use it when he really needs it.

You are literally cancelling days that she didn't know were scheduled.", "NTA - and yes you are helping her out....  \nyou and your fiance are taking a day off work to babysit your sister's child so she can go to the wedding.

It's your days off, you decide when and how to spend them. You're already doing her a favor for taking care of the child in June. If she needs helps she should hire a babysitter. Expecting you to not only babysit for free but also waste one of your days off on babysitting for her when there's no reason for it is out of line.", "NTA. Let your mum do the April day if she\u2019s so keen for sis to get a break.", "NTA.\n\nIt's an error and lack of communication by your mother and sister. \n\nConfirm you will be babysitting for the wedding, and that should be the end of the conversation.", "NTA. I'd refuse any and all future babysitting until you're given a genuine apology, and you'd be within your rights to ask for compensation.

She can\u2019t be mad you\u2019re not also randomly taking off vacation time next Friday or something just to give her an extra day off.   That\u2019s crazy.  Your mom can do it if she feels so strongly about it.  Your sister is in for a rough ride.  Not many new moms of 14 week olds would even be willing to leave baby for a wedding, yet she\u2019s trying to coerce you into another random day.", "WBTA for asking Mom and taking her judgement on the dates as word, but you clarified so NTA.\n\nNTA for them assuming you're a free babysitter, your days are for you, it was a nice gesture to even agree in the first place since your parents are busy.\n\nBut, speaking of, if your parents knew they were too busy to babysit in the first place, how come mom gave you the wrong dates to book off of work??? She should have known her own (un)availability and recounted from there.", "NTA she is now demanding 2 days from you for free babysitting. Jesus Christ the entitlement of some people. That is your time. She only asked for June for a specific event she can find a paid babysitter if she needs more time or your mother can help her and watch the baby that day in April.  Both your mom and sister sound like assholes for not respecting you and your time.", "Nta", "NAH - just say you can babysit April but don\u2019t have PTO for June, and say mom gave you the April date AND made the decision for you to babysit in April\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to explain you\u2019re saving PTO, you just allotted the requested day for your sister and your mom made the decision for her", "ESH\n\n\n\nYour Mom shouldn't have volunteered you....not her place. If she feels a certain way Mom can volunteer her babysitting services then and give your sister a break.\n\nYour sister shouldn't be upset about you canceling the wrong date. She asked for a babysitter for the wedding...not a different day ...\n\nYou should have asked your sister directly for the correct date. Again...since you didn't write it down the first time. Why would you ask someone else about babysitting date besides the actual parents? Had you bothered to make the effort to do that you would have had the correct date from the jump and avoided the extra drama.\n\nSo yes everyone sucks in this situation. You're not blameless OP. Cancel the day off and get the correct one. Since you have extra time try to get more comfortable with the baby.. that way your hubby could conserve his day off since you said it was a big deal for him.", "ESH. Your sis very slightly for being upset at you for not babysitting a day you didn't agree to. Your mom for butting in and offering you to your sis on the wrong day that SHE TOLD YOU. And you to yourself for getting yourself into this situation in the first place. It's great that you agreed to babysit for her wedding. And forgetting the date happens. But you should have gotten the date from your sister herself, not your mom, when you forgot. That's where you went wrong and why YTJ. \n\nHowever, you're NTJ for wanting to not babysit on a day that's not your sister's wedding when the dates got mixed up. There's no difference than if you just happened to get an extra day off. You're not obligated to then use that day to babysit for your sis, and your mom shouldn't have jumped in and said you would.\n\nETA: \"TJ to yourself\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No doubt there are exceptions, whether due to professions or large families or what have you. \n\nBut I will not die on this hill, and OP is free to let us all know if she is an experienced and confident babysitter of babies.", "It doesn't matter..... It's an important date. It's a huge deal to OP and her hubby to ask for time off... You go straight to the source. If her sister isn't available to answer basic questions then how is it possible for anyone to babysit her child?? Funny since her parents watch the child every Sunday and OP watches her  a couple Saturdays a month.\n\nShe's not 100% blameless in this. As soon as OP realized she forgot to write the dates down she should have gotten ahold of the sister. She just wanted an instant answer and unfortunately taking the short cut didn't pan well for her. Communication improvement is needed for everyone.", "While I do agree he should be a much more involved parent, if the sisters only job is to take care of the kid, it may be stressful, but if the father is the one providing the home, the finances, because he's working a lot to support the family, how is this a bad thing?", "I\u2019m definitely not experienced and confident sadly!

How does it make her an asshole if she\u2019s still babysitting on the day her sister wanted her to??", "OP is 100% blameless. The current conflict is a result of: (1) the mother volunteering OP to babysit in April and (2) the sister expecting OP to babysit in April (and the day of the wedding as originally agreed to). This expectation that OP will babysit on this non-wedding April date is not the result of OP\u2019s lack of communication. It is the result of the mom volunteering that date from OP. Had she not done that, there is no conflict.\n\nAnd why she went to mom makes perfect sense if she needs the information immediately and she can\u2019t get the sister on the phone. Most jobs require that these requests be put in weeks in advance.", "I didn't say it was a bad thing, which is why I explicitly said that setting aside x hours a day is necessary. But after he is done his job, he needs to help out with his baby.\n\nShe is also doing a full-time job, as primary caregiver, which is exhausting. If he works and then gets time off, she should work and get time off as well. Which means they need to find a balance where he also supports her to have time for herself to catch up with her friends that does not include the baby.", "I had zero baby experience when I had my daughter. And I mean literally zero. I'd never even held a baby before. Most of it is common sense, the rest of it you can talk to your doctor about or look up on your own (like how to support their head until they can do it on their own, how long they should sleep vs be awake, how to change a diaper or put on a onesie).", "Yep!! It is like blaming OP for expressing excitement at babysitting the niece. It makes absolutely no sense.", "Because she asked her Mom about the dates and not her sister.... the person she's actually babysitting for. If she had reached out and waited for a response the mistake wouldn't have happened. You don't ask a third party about childcare arrangements....you ask the parents directly.", "She didn't even try to get ahold of her sister. She asked a third party about someone else's childcare needs. You only talk to the parents about that..for a multitude of reasons.\n\nThe conflict exists because OP asked the Mom and not the sister AFTER forgetting the important dates. She's not blameless. Everyone is stuck on the Mom being in the wrong about volunteering OP for the wrong date. It's not okay for Mom to volunteer OP for the wrong date. Just like it was wrong for OP to ask Mom about the sister's  important plan/ date. Mom shouldn't be speaking for either sister and the sisters shouldn't be using Mom for information either.", "Still that isn\u2019t why the sister expects OP to babysit in April. She expects that because the mom volunteered her to do it.", "Lol!! How did OP asking mom for the date cause the sister to expect OP to babysit on that date? It didn\u2019t. There is no logical connection between, asking mom for the date of wedding and expecting someone to babysit in April. The source of that expectation is the mom volunteering OP, not OP asking mom for the date of the wedding."]}
