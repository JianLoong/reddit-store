That she's too young to get married and that how old is he? Clearly too old for her. He didn't even ask my blessing.  She got mad I wasn't supportive.\n\nShe invited me out to a dinner with Kyle and his parents. I said that I was busy working. Days later she gave me texted me, not an invatation thing just a text, an invite to the wedding. I told her that I didn't approve of the marrage and it was a huge mistake. I don't want her getting hurt from this huge and bad idea. \n\nShe said that she was marring him either way and it was my choice to be there or not. I ended up not going and now her husband is really mad at me and she won't talk to me bc of that. \n\nIt isn't like she came to my wedding (she was a teen by then).", "created_utc": 1692331301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u9l8e/aita_for_not_going_to_my_daugters_wedding/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As an adult and a parent, you should have had the maturity and foresight to *think* that if your daughter really is being abused, you need to find a way to be there for her. In fact you sound very controlling yourself and that might explain why she gravitated towards a controlling older partner in the first place. You chose punishing your daughter over protecting her just because she was doing something you didn't approve of. Sometimes life is like a chess game and I'm afraid in this instance you've either been too stupid or too vengeful to play a game better. Now if/when your daughter is abused, she is all alone.", "Esh.  Daughter is too immature to get married.  Guy is creepy horrible.

Do you think she\u2019ll be okay with you being a part of their life? Probably not. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to approve, and you don\u2019t have to like him, but by refusing to be civil to him and be supportive of your daughter you\u2019re showing her that you will throw a tantrum when you don\u2019t get your way, and that you\u2019ll refuse to accept her decisions as an adult. You\u2019ve made it nearly impossible to come to you if she ever needs anything- she will surely go to her in-laws instead.", "NTA - I don't know how anyone could respect a 40 year old for sleeping with a teenager.

Your daughter is likely making a terrible and possibly dangerous decision.

Instead what you should have done is said I don\u2019t think you are thinking this through but if you need help I am there for you and then spend time with your daughter to give opportunities to escape.\n\nNow there are scenarios between those but in no scenario does you refusing to give your blessing like your daughter is a piece of property benefit anyone.

This sounds like a big one but the worst thing you can do is distance yourself from her right now when she will need your support if/when this doesn't work out.

You shutting her down, refusing to meet him and not showing up to the wedding is potentially going to do more harm. Because do you think you\u2019re who she\u2019s going to turn to if she\u2019s in trouble? You\u2019ve very clearly outlined you don\u2019t approve and whether or not you think she knows you\u2019d help, she may not.

Be the parent and be present for your daughter", "OP all three of you are adults making grown-up decisions.  If you can't be civil then just stay low contact or no contact.  It's just not worth wasting the energy.  You can't choose family and life is just too short.  If it lasts 6 months, 6 years, or even longer, it's her life and her choice.  She has to learn from her decisions - just like you do.  Again ignore the ill-will and go on with her life.  If an olive branch is offered, take it and keep it civil, don't throw accusations and if it's done then just walk away.  Focus on your mental health and what makes you happy.  Best of luck to you.", "YTA\n\nBut not for disapproving their relationship and marriage (bc this is probably right) but for isolating her from you. Meet the guy, get to know him and be there for your daughter when she finally (hopefully!) decides to leave his sorry ass.\nI can imagine a scenario where she's married to him, gets mistreated and wants to leave but can't because you and her cut all the ties or she's just to afraid to admit she was wrong and you were right. That would be terribly sad.\nI think it's important to be there for your kid. Especially when they enter adulthood and make bad decisions.", "You made a foolish choice based on the assumption your blessing mattered to her. Now, you've isolated her. She's firmly in his grasp and she can't/won't come to you for help when she realizes what he is.\n\nHolding onto her decision as a teen not to come to your wedding is petty.

But bc her mom held her tongue, the daughter was able to feel comfortable leaving a bad marriage. She was very embarrassed so it was really important that she had her parents' support. Unfortunately she's continued to make bad romantic decisions, but her parents will always be there to support her. \n\nYour daughter is getting married and will rather quickly realize her husband's a creep. Don't make her feel like she has to stay with him just to prove you wrong. Don't make her think she can't come to you if she needs help. Unfortunately this seems like it'll get even worse with a pregnancy and then she'll really need your help. She knows how you feel about her boyfriend.

But just dismissing the both of them and turning your back is just making her dig in. Stop being so absolute about it if you want to have any sway. You have to show her empathy! You have to let her know that you understand that she wants to feel loved and that the attention from an older (and to her eyes confident/successful/mature/charming/etc.) man is very flattering.
