You\u2019re never the AH for standing up for yourself against a bully.", "I hope you\u2019re kidding, obviously NTA. Keep your hair short! Love yourself! Get your favorite snack and cozy up to watch the Barbie movie, the craft, legally blonde, or a league of their own. You are better off without him.", "Strong NTA\n\nCongratulations on getting that wretch out of your life.", "NTA, your husband sounds like a bit of a jerk, divorcing you because you cut your hair short and wanted to take care of your grandmother.", "NTA. Sometimes people just slows us down and prevent use from doing what we need to do. Good for you for taking care of your grandma and cutting your hair ! Seems like the relationship won't be a big loss.", "NTA\n\nHonesty from what you say your marriage was over, way before you cut your hair, probably before you moved in with your grandma to care for her.\n\nit's just an excuse, not the reason. it's just hair, hair grows, and it's not just hair. IT'S YOUR HAIR\n\nNo one has the right to dictate what you do with it, even if they hate it. the polite response is \"well it's not what I would have gone for, but that's not important. Do you like it\"\n\nThese are all red flags, he wants to dictate you, and control you and when she showed a spine, threw you out of the house. and by the way, it's your house too, there are rights. please check out what they are.\n\nyou deserve better, and if he starts to play the \"please come home, I'm missing you. if you don't come home. I'll kill myself\" which is extreme, but he did throw you out and blame you for basically making him do it. emotional manipulation, is one of the tactics, since this is after he demanded that you not cut your hair, because of how it impacts him. and when he realises he has no power over you, this is a powerplay often seen \n\nif he does that, please call the police\n\nbecause and please tell yourself this \"You (i) Deserve Better)", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. Good luck!", "NTA. You can do whatever you want with your hair. However in a healthy relationship, you do want to pay attention to things that your SO finds attractive or unattractive.

People still try to use \"forbid\" to express how they feel? It seems like you two had lost any love / respect for eachother so I'd be celebrating the freedom?", "NTA. I am petty as heck and I will absolutely do anything I am TOLD not to do by my supposed equal.", "NTA - RUN! This relationship sounds controlling, unloving, unsupportive, and just unhealthy. No loving husband kicks his wife out over hair and being a good person. You deserve better, and it's amazing that you are looking out for your family and trying new things with your look!

Something tells me you're going to be happier without that kind of bullshit going on in your life. Stay happy!", "ESH not living with your husband five days a week is huge. That should have been more of a discussion. That choice affects everyone in a home as well as your relationship. The hair thing may just have been a weird thing due to you essentially moving out. IDK, only you know how he usually is. Was he controlling before you moved in with your grandmother? If so, then peace out. If he was fine until you noped out of the house, then it's more on you.", "NTA of course, you decide your own haircut and your marriage isn't over because of the hair, it was over a long time ago.
