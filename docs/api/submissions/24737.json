I told him I wanted to go live with her 5 days a week. And I did that too, because I knew my aunt wasn't going to do it, she wanted to put her in a nursing home, and I didn't want her to go into a nursing home, (Former NH social worker). I knew my marriage was pretty much over after I moved in with my grandmother... anyway back to the original reason for the post, he kicked me out of our home, that I had basically paid a year of when he was without a job.... And claimed that it was my fault, because I told him \"I'm my own person.\" After I did it. I still love my short hair!\nI know I probably am... but I wanted to hear what\nReddit has to say....\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve gotten a lot of hate from my (soon to be former) in laws which is why I think I\u2019m the ahole.  But honestly I feel like I was in the right.\n\nI'm going to start, with I tried to talk to him, but he ALWAYS shut me down. Before I went to live with my grandmother, he didn't even want to talk about it he shut me down. He said, \"I forbid you to go live with her.\" I tried talking to him about it for a week, that\u2019s all he would say to me for a week, and he slept on the couch that entire week, his choice. NOT mine... my hair was closer to 2 months, I tried to talk to him about it. I spent every weekend with him all summer long trying to talk to him about it. I cut my hair on Thursday last week, and he dropped the bombshell on me Friday when I went home for the weekend.\n\nThere is no definite end date. It's whenever she passes, she went on hospice care 4 months ago, so I moved in, because I was able too work remotely, and he knew that.\n\nI still paid for 1/2+ of everything. Including food that I didn't eat. I have insurance through my jobs. And my grandmother was a nurse at the hospital, so she had good benefits and still receives $2,000 a month from her retirement, which is used to pay for all her household things.\n\nSomeone just commented on this post saying, I didn\u2019t give enough info. I hope that\u2019s enough.

This post is purposefully burying the lead for validation.", "You sound exactly like my ex sister in law, who by the way was there every step of our marriage trying to get him to divorce me, because I wasn\u2019t \u201cGood enough\u201d for her brother.", "But I did try to talk to him about it, several times, but every time he shut me down.", "I\u2019m going to start, with I tried to talk to him, but he ALWAYS shut me down. Before I went to live with my grandmother, he didn\u2019t even want to talk about it he shut me down. He said, \u201cI forbid you to go live with her.\u201d I tried talking to him about it for a week\u2026 my hair was closer to 2 months, I tried to talk to him about it. I spent every weekend with him all summer long trying to talk to him about it. I cut my hair on Thursday last week\u2026\n\nThere is no definite end date. It\u2019s whenever she passes, she went on hospice care 4 months ago, so I moved in, bc I was able too work remotely, and he knew that.\n\nI still paid for 1/2+ of everything. Including food that I didn\u2019t eat.  I have insurance through my jobs. And my grandmother was a nurse at the hospital, so she had/ has good benefits and still receives $2,000 a month for retirement, which is used to pay for all her household things, plus it gave me time to go home every weekend.", "Yeah like. He is not divorcing her for the haircut.", "Yep.", "I had respect for him until he forbade me to do something that I felt needed to be done.", "Thank you for your opinion.", "He can\u2019t. We\u2019re both on the note. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "His family all think I\u2019m the ahole. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Please see my edit", "Thank you, for your opinion. I showed him the hair cut I wanted 2 months BEFORE I got it cut. And I STILL love it. 5 days later.", "I love my haircut. I loved it since I saw the picture of it.", "People can\u2019t \u201cforbid\u201d you from doing things.  You are a grown adult capable of making decisions.  Decisions may have consequences but so be it-he can be free if you and you can go find happiness", "Exactly!! Any dude who will leave you over hair is not worth your time! \n\nI have two stories for you:\n\n1) In college I decided to go from long locks to a very short pixie cut. I asked my friends and bf their opinions. EVERYONE said I shouldn't do it. So I did it without telling anyone, including my bf. Guess what, they LOVED it, or kept their mouths shut which is just as good. My bf didn't leave me and after a week or so life continued on like normal! \n\n2) I am now much older and married, I change my hair VERY often, color, cut, etc. Every time I think of trying something new I ask my husband, \"how do you think I would look with this cut?\". His response is always the same, \"I haven't seen it yet, so I have no idea, do what you want.\" And he always loves it because he loves me. Just like I love him even when he has a scratchy beard!\n\nThe way your husband reacted IS NOT OK! Do not think it is normal.", "Then what happened?", "She wasn't wrong tho.", "How did you only cut your hair last Thursday, yet in a previous comment you said you've kept it shaved for 6 months?", "You didn\u2019t, though. It\u2019s not respecting your partner or your marriage to unilaterally move out for 5 days per week, I don\u2019t care what the reason was or how strongly you felt about it. But that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s done now.", "Even though he had \"pretty much been controlling your every move before you moved out\"?", "In that case this marriage sounds like it was toxic. \n\nControlling behavior is toxic. \n\nThat being said, you basically moved out of your house. I understand wanting to care for a loved one, but in a healthy marriage, you and your spouse are family. Big decisions should be talked about. \n\nOf course you can do what you want with your hair. Forbidding anything is ridiculous. However, he was not at fault for not liking your hair. Also, it seems as if you cut your hair this way as an FU rather than just because you liked it. In a healthy relationship of course you can do what you want with your body, but both partners should ideally take each others preferences into consideration.", "I\u2019m kinda with this guy on YTA. Moving out 5 days a week unilaterally is basically saying you value keeping your grandmother in her home more then you value your marriage. \n\nI\u2019m mean it\u2019s your right to do it but don\u2019t expect your marriage to survive such a clear statement of priorities. \n\nSounds like your marriage had other issues anyways tho.", "Did he really kick her out? He's got a pretty strong argument that she moved out of her own free will, now he's just not letting her visit.", "Sweet child, it is time to leave, these are big big scary abusive signs. This control can and will get uglier. Isolation comes first. I hate divorce and would only suggest it in rare cases. But, if he is  controlling your day to day actions you need to get help and carefully get out. I think you may have chosen to live with Grandma to avoid living with him. That self preservation is instinctual. Listen to it. Then please get yourself into counseling, I think you are going to need it.", "But not the deed...a deed is the *only* document that proves who legally owns the home. I think you're going to need a good lawyer.", "Hon, the police would have told him this has nothing to do with them. You're married, and it's your house. No crime, and they only deal in obvious legal violations not civil matters. Even when things get bad they generally ask the man to leave. Possession is 9/10ths of the law too. Leaving puts you at a disadvantage legally in the future.", "Thats good! I'm sure it will grow on him. I know at first I wasn't crazy bout it but after a while I liked it way more than I did at first", "Yeah, he would. He has already proven that.  Never ever take that mindset!  Ever!  That is like shooting your self in the foot and calling it good.  Just don\u2019t.", "I can't emphasize this enough: Don't assume that. Protect yourself, because you don't want an awful surprise.", "Thank you for your opinion.", "I said 6 days, AND I still love it.", "How does that not add up? I wanted him to fight for our marriage, and he didn\u2019t. Instead he forbid me to go be with her. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from. Thank you for your opinion.", "Take each others preferences for how they like you to look into consideration? That is gross - she's a person, not a doll.", "No. I honestly can not. I told myself when I got home, I wasn\u2019t gonna fight him.", "Both of our names are on the note. And we don\u2019t have children, and i offered to continue to pay for our dogs food.", "The things you offered had basically no possible compromises. So like what else did you want him to do.", "In a comment on your other post, you definitely say 6 months...guess that was a typo then sorry!", "I can\u2019t count. 5 days.", "You said if he let you go without a fight you would know the marriage was over. But you also say he forbade you from going. \n\n\u201cForbidding\u201d is extreme but that IS \u201cputting up a fight\u201d.", "Wanted him to fight for your marriage? What the actual fuck. Grown ass adults don\u2019t play these stupid games.", "What does that even mean? I agree that this is not about the haircut but the fact you moved out", "With all due respect, that doesn't seem to make sense to me.  He let you go without a fight yet he forbade you to go?  What type of fight were you expecting?  \n\nMarriages only work when both want to be together, not when one has to fight to keep the other one.  What am I missing here?", "Imagine you are in a committed loving relationship with someone. You tell them you would like to dye your hair orange with pink stripes. They tell you that this particular hairstyle is a huge turn off. If their opinion would really not even concern you, I think that says more about your relationship than it does about your hair preferences. Maybe it means you are not ultimately compatible if the hair would truly make you happy. But to not care that your partner wouldn\u2019t like it at all says you don\u2019t value your partners input. \n\nTo be clear, no one should ever say the words \u201cI forbid\u201d in a relationship. That is a huge red flag.  \n\nHowever, not caring about your partners input at all is also a red flag that the relationship is likely not in a good place.", "Whose names are on the mortgage note doesn't legally mean much. Is your name on the deed to the house?", "Paying for dog food has nothing to do with the house.  You need to realise how easily you can be screwed over and hasn\u2019t he done enough of that already?", "Yes. It was. I\u2019m looking for the comment. Sorry, love!", "Comment straight out of r/RomanticAdvice", "I've been with my husband for 28 years. If he was 'turned off' by a haircut or colour, then there was no relationship worth it's salt in the first place. Love and attraction is about the entire person, not just their appearance... That's such a sad view of relationships.", "It will be when we pay off the house.", "I\u2019ve never been in that sub but I\u2019ll take your word for it, as what I wrote seems like common sense. I\u2019m sure many people have said something similar more eloquently!\n\nOy- now you helped me find a new sub to further dive into\u2026 yay insomnia!", "Why are you waiting that long? If you're both paying the mortgage, your name should have been on the title from Day One. If it isn't, the house LEGALLY is only your husband's.", "If that is the case and he is on it but you\u2019re is not.  Deed vs mortgage is waaaaay different.  \n\nIf it\u2019s not, it\u2019s all his, not yours. You are basically a \u201cco-signer\u201d at that point. \n\nWise up and protect yourself.", "UHH IS THAT IN WRITING??\n\nI think you need to speak to a lawyer!!!", "I misread. Yes. My name is on the deed as well as the note."]}
