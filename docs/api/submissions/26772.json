In England, it was recently brutally hot and many people wore summer clothes understandably. I however have severe old scarring on 90% of my body excluding my face so I wore some leggings, a tank top and a black jacket in case it got too unbearably hot. I did this to avoid the looks I get from people but I figured if I got too dizzy I'd just not care and remove my jacket. My jacket wasn't obscene or anything, it just had some skeleton bones across the front and back. I was minding my business with my brother when a lady who mustve been taking her daughters out came up to me and started saying my jacket was inappropriate. Now, I'd understand if it was lewd but this jacket was literally plain with skeleton bones on it. Nothing was inappropriate. Still, she made some subtle digs at it, at the heat and what type of person wears those jackets. I'm Indian and she seemed also like a traditional Indian woman and I know from many interactions that I don't look the way I should. I have dyed hair, piercings etc you get the look. I got annoyed and asked her to leave me alone because I wanted to just enjoy the weather with my little brother but she kept talking. \n\nSo I then offered to take my jacket off, knowing she'd get pissed and ofc she said yes, not knowing what I look like. So I removed my jacket and it wasn't pretty but to be fair neither is my body. She gave a dramatic gasp and turned her kids away, ranting about me and eventually an employee stepped in but I could tell even he was staring at me. Once she had gone back to wear she sat, still glaring, I simply put it back on. \n\nMy hair is long so it covered the sides of my neck, so she couldn't see scarring there but I don't know if she saw the front or not because nothing was said and she didn't stare intensely like how many people do. Either way, I think it was deserved but my brother says I'm TA because she didn't know what I look like.
