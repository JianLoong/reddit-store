I did this to avoid the looks I get from people but I figured if I got too dizzy I'd just not care and remove my jacket. My jacket wasn't obscene or anything, it just had some skeleton bones across the front and back. I was minding my business with my brother when a lady who mustve been taking her daughters out came up to me and started saying my jacket was inappropriate. Now, I'd understand if it was lewd but this jacket was literally plain with skeleton bones on it. Nothing was inappropriate. Still, she made some subtle digs at it, at the heat and what type of person wears those jackets. I'm Indian and she seemed also like a traditional Indian woman and I know from many interactions that I don't look the way I should. I have dyed hair, piercings etc you get the look. I got annoyed and asked her to leave me alone because I wanted to just enjoy the weather with my little brother but she kept talking. \n\nSo I then offered to take my jacket off, knowing she'd get pissed and ofc she said yes, not knowing what I look like. So I removed my jacket and it wasn't pretty but to be fair neither is my body.

People like that are prematurely old, and I'm saying that as a 50something. I can't imagine how she handles Halloween. Your little brother is also not the A - his reaction sounds like ingrained \"respect your elders\" upbringing.

And your brother sucks", "NTA, I'm proud of you. You handled someone who was being fussy and rude very maturely and she threw a fit because it didn't go exactly her way. Honestly here are the people who stare openly at scars on other people:\n\n* Rude and nosy fucks who honestly embarrass themselves\n* Children\n\nYou know what? When I was a kid I was nosy because I was a kid. If someone didn't have a leg I would stare at them. I am not here to tell you people don't stare because they do. But I was still not so rude and nosy as to ask why they didn't have a leg because my parents explained, very simply, people look different. THE END. I hope most people with any effing self-respect would glance over, be surprised, then *go back to their own fucking business and lives*. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. It sucks people stare. But you also shouldn't put your own health at risk to protect their fragile egos. It's hot. Wear short sleeves. Sometimes I am super self concious about my body in short sleeves. But at the end of the day I just want to be outside where there is a flaming ball of gas heating up our atmosphere and drink my silly drink and I'll likely never see these people again. They'll learn to cope with you being a person in a public space and you deserve the minimum of basic respect we afford to pigeons.\n\nGirl, you are young still. And I am so, so aware I am speaking on a soapbox of my own privilege because I don't have burn scars and I have light skin. But if you were in a Starbucks near me and someone was being a dick to you, I would dump my stupid oatmilk cold brew into their lap and give you a copy of Gideon the Ninth for your sick ass jacket.

Sorry you have to deal with people like that OP. I didn't realize scarring was such an issue for others! I see people with scars and it barely registers. Skin is an organ there to protect our vital bits and it sounds like it did its job. \n\nI know everyone has insecurities and I don't want you to think I don't have empathy for that, but giving up caring what people think about you is freeing. If you can, start working towards just not giving a flying fuck if people are staring.   \n\n\nThis isn't the same thing at all, but I have piercings, tattoos, and wear alt clothing and when I see someone staring I just look them directly in the eye and give them the biggest smile. Surprisingly, 90% of people give me a smile back (even the little old ladies I assume would be appalled at style). The other 10% look away after being caught judging, which I think is way more embarrassing than being and loving yourself.", "NTA.  She was incredibly rude both before you removed your jacket and afterwards.  I'm sorry this is a situation you had to deal with.", "NTA- but please don't cover yourself to make other people comfortable. If they have a problem with how you look that's on them. If you're comfortable with yourself then you just be you and wear what you want. Someone is always going to be there to judge even if you were the most perfect looking person on the planet. Your scars are just badges of your strength, they are nothing to be ashamed of. The only people who should be ashamed are those who think they have any right to say a damn thing about you.", "NTA, not remotely.

Sadly though in many places it can lead to abuse, however hopefully a whole lot of the UK is much more accepting than it was in the past.", "You did nothing wrong. The woman wasn't taking no for an answer and was still bothering you. I think she really wanted you to leave for whatever reason. \n\nSome people are just going to feel so entitled that they think they get to dictate other people's behavior and dress. When they don't get what they want, they get even more angry. It's best just to smile and wave and continue to enjoy yourself.\n\nYour brother sounds like he was really just upset at the unwanted attention. You were just the handy person to yell at over it. He'll get over it as he gets older and probably be more amused than anything at the drama.", "If this woman has such a problem with bones then what does she do during Halloween??", "nta but id consider reposting this on r/traumatizethemback", "NTA", "NTA.... I've grew up trying to hide the scars (Burns) until I learned that they dont define me. Now I wear them proudly - they made me stronger.", "NTA, good for you, and it does your brother good to see a strong and confident woman in his life who takes no shit. Hopefully he learns from that over time.", "NTA. Make sure your little brother understands that this woman was being a righteous asshole, regardless of how you look under your jacket.", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have to hide your body for others comfort and your brother is ridiculous to say you should\u2019ve, though maybe you should get your brother a similar jacket so that way he can have a spine, just saying. \n\nBut yeah keep being you and be proud of who you are, ignore idiots who judge your scarring or appearance because those types of people usually are the people who you wouldn\u2019t trust with your coffee, so I wouldn\u2019t give them your time and emotions either, I hope you have a good week despite that encounter", "Why people feel it is appropriate to police what other people wear, I will never understand. At the very *least*, you may not agree with it, roast that person *in your mind*, but never open your mouth to them.\n\nI see nothing wrong with your jacket. It actually sounds pretty fetch (I could be biased because I am a fan of the skeletal system, and Jolly Roger has always been a good friend of mine). She found it offensive. She also probably thought it odd that you were wearing a jacket in warm (recently hot) balmy weather so that alerted something in her. She was nosey, pointed, accusatory, and frankly I feel like she should have had more comeuppance than just mild shock when you did remove the jacket. Let her understand that it's none of her business AT ALL.\n\nI get a lot of weird looks too, as I am always covered up head to toe, even in hot weather. Long pants, arm sleeves, hoodie, neckerchief, sunhat, sunglasses that take up half my face, etc. - the Sun and I are at odds, and I find it to be more effective than sunscreen. Thankfully no one (stranger-wise) has outright said anything to me out in public yet, but I hope I can think of something as simple but effective as what you did \\^\\_\\^\n\nAlso, EMBRACE YOUR SCARS. I don't mean just start baring your skin - obviously that is not something you're ready to do, but please do not be ashamed of having them to begin with. Whatever happened to cause them, no matter how devastating, no matter the price you paid to bear that physical reminder for the rest of your life - it wasn't enough to defeat you. That is beautiful.", "NTA, but that woman who spoke to you certainly is. You should not feel bad about either wearing that jacket *or* taking it off.\n\nThat said, if you *do* want to cover up (for whatever reason) on extremely hot days, here's a bit of information you might find useful: I don't have scars but I do have a medical condition that makes me very sensitive to the sun (and I currently live in Georgia, USA, where the sun is far more intense than anything the UK has to deal with.) My first couple summers here were purest misery, until I learned that most forms of rayon fabric (also known as \"viscose,\" \"ice silk\" or \"bamboo\") do not hold ANY body heat at all. So I always wear long pants and long sleeves during the daylight hours, even on the hottest summer days, but since they're made of viscose or rayon they're almost as cool as wearing shorts. (Especially since I do tend to prefer black or dark colors, which are more heat-absorbing than white or lighter shades.) \n\nOf course, the one downside is that I have to strictly segregate my clothes into \"hot weather\" and \"anything else\"; if temperatures are too chilly to be comfortable while naked, then it's too chilly to wear rayon/bamboo/viscose fabric. Also, the viscose form of rayon seems especially prone to stretching out, compared to other forms of fabric. But on hot and humid days where temperatures are in the 80s or above (Fahrenheit scale), rayon/viscose/bamboo is the only fabric I can comfortably wear in the sun.", "1000% NTA\n\nFirst off, kudos on the malicious compliance. A+\n\nSecond, no one has the right to tell you how to dress yourself (outside like public decency laws and whatnot ig)\n\nThird, there's nothing wrong with your scars and if someone has a problem with it then that's on them. I totally understand not being comfortable showing something like scars and I would never judge someone for that choice but there's no reason anyone should be giving you shit for it.\n\n I have a whole lot of self-inflicted scars from my teen years, especially on my legs. I used to avoid wearing shorts as I would get lots of stares if I showed my legs. As I've aged I've started giving less fucks. My past is what it is and while I still have complicated feelings about my scars I know there's nothing wrong with them.
