We had to rush into marriage after just two months together cause I got pregnant. I was a SAH mom for 10yrs. We got divorced when my daughter was 10yrs and her dad had physical custody since I had no job or a house at the time of the divorce, he remarried soon after and my daughter is close to her step mom. \n\nRight now I work at a restaurant as a chef , ive worked here for the last 8 years, and it pays okay though my ex-husband earns more. My daugh r\u00a0 is at an age where she considers me embarrassing, she is beginning to mirror what her dad had always said to me. When she would come into my job with friends she would usually text me beforehand not to talk to her and she has never introduced them to me or vice versa. \n\nShe is back from college for the holidays and I wanted to treat her so I asked her to come by the restaurant to pick up the afternoon special which happens to be her favourite. I was expecting her to come alone so when she texted that she was out front I excused myself and went out to give it to her and hugged her from behind and kissed her and that's when I noticed she looked uncomfortable and was angry. She just asked for the meal and walked out. \n\nI didnt think much of it until I got off work and my ex had sent me a series of messages insulting and berating me for intentionally humiliating my daughter to make a point, apparently her friends were in the car and she had to field questions from them about our relationship especially as I was still on my workwear when I got out to give her the food.

Your daughter is being horrible and has clearly bought into the shitty narrative your ex has pushed about you being 'less than'. You deserve better than this treatment. I'm not so sure I would put up with it at all tbh.", "Your daughter's attitude is the only thing responsible for her 'humiliation'. NTA", "NTA\n\nHow your daughter views you just because you don't have a degree or a degree-related job tells me that is how she views every other human being that works blue-collar and it's disgusting.\n\nIf she thinks so little of people who work at restaurants then she shouldn't be so willing to take the food they prepare. If she thinks so little of the woman working retail, she should not demean herself to go shopping in stores. If she thinks so little of the people who repair the apartments she lives in, then she should have to deal with a broken toilet.\n\nIf these jobs aren't \"real jobs\" or and the people who work them are beneath her, then she should go ahead and take care of all of those things herself to avoid interacting with people so clearly below her.", "Ummm... NTA... don't let them belittle you... this is bullshit right here...\n\nSounds like your husband is a snob, and he raised your daughter to be a snob...\n\nThat's not on you, you have absolutely nothing to apologize for here...\n\nDon't let either of them gaslight you!", "NTA The snobbery your daughter has picked up from her father ultimately harms her as well as you. It's not a healthy worldview and won't lead her down a happy path in life if she keeps following it. Hopefully she will shake it off as she matures and will feel ashamed at the attitude she has taken with you. \n\nYour ex is the source of this poison so what he says is obviously coming from that misguided viewpoint. Don't let him get to you. \n\nYou displayed love toward your daughter and she is only rejecting it because she is interpreting everything through her father's warped lens.", "NTA, this is heartbreaking. You didn\u2019t humiliate your daughter and if she feels that way then she should be ashamed of herself. Her dad sounds like a real snob and it has rubbed off on your daughter. Have you tried talking to her about it? I hope things improve for you.", "NTA. She\u2019s embarrassed of you BUT it\u2019s not your fault. You did nothing wrong at all. You have an honest job, it\u2019s better than being homeless and struggling.\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed of who you are. \ud83e\udd17", "Nta for loving your daughter. For being her mom. \n\nSadly your ex has fed her years of poison. Your ex benefiting from you dropping everything to raise your daughter. \n\nAnyhow she is in the teenage years where they are more concerned about appearances. It may take time, hardship , world experiences, or even motherhood itself to come to appreciate all you have done for her.", "You're good enough to cook for her, but not good enough to interact with? I'm sorry, I know she's your daughter, I know you love her, but she's grown into a spoiled and snobbish little madam. NTA, but your ex sure is. And that superiority complex is going to bite your daughter in the backside eventually, mark my words :(", "NTA\nThe only embarrassing behavior here is your daughter's. And your ex's. I'm sorry the girl turned out to be a snob, I can I only hope she matures when she becomes older and v then she'll be embarrassed for how she treated you, which is abominable. You work an honest job, you're nothing to be e embarrassed about. People who happily benefit from service workers but who also look down on them are the worst.", "NTA, You didn\u2019t expect her friends to be there. You thought she would have came alone and just wanted to give her a treat since she has just come back from college, you weren\u2019t trying to prove a point from how you wrote this post. Your ex husband should not have berated you for something you weren\u2019t intentionally doing. Your daughter purposely excluded you from her social life. As that may be understandable to some extent. But her friends don\u2019t even know you, you were just trying to do a nice gesture and definitely weren\u2019t being a a**hole.", "You are a good mom..", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine being embarrassed by affection from my parents and free food. Honestly most of my friends would probably be jealous bc they come from broken homes. I wouldn\u2019t care what they thought about it even if they did tease about it", "[removed]", "Nta \n\nYour ex has done a very poor job at raising her to be such a snob.  And he is stupid to agree with her.", "NTA. Your ex has sadly taught her to be the elitist AH that he is. You need to have a talk with her about how what you do is in fact not embarrassing, but a lot of people wouldn\u2019t eat without people of your expertise. Give her a set of knives and ask her to whip up your favorite dish and see how she does.", "NTA, but i really do hope your daughter sees this and gets the wake-up call that she has been manipulated by her vile father. That level of attitude is not going to get her far in life.\n\nI feel sorry for you that he has alienated you and your child, but she is old enough now to deal with the consequences of her behaviour. \n\nIf your job brings that much humiliation to her life, then she won't need a penny you earn from it. I really hope she comes to her senses, but i highly doubt it.", "Nta So she\u2019s embarrassed of you? For no good reason besides your career choice? Your daughter is totally in the wrong here. She should know not to shame ppl for their lives. It\u2019s gross that she treats you this way. You really shouldn\u2019t let her treat you like this. She seems to be quite a snob.", "Nta. Hes an asshole and he's raising one too. You deserved so much better than to be looked down on by him. This actually breaks my heart.", "NTA", "OP. \n\nTake a step back and breathe. \n\nNow reread what you wrote. \n\nYou are a competent, hardworking, smart woman but you\u2019re absolutely COWERING to these 2. Where the fuck do you get off disrespecting yourself this way? \n\nFfs. Splash some water on your face, pull yo panties up, and lay out some boundaries here. If they will not follow them, walk the fuck away bc they\u2019ve already walked away from you. \n\nIdk the circumstances around you losing custody. Maybe you made bad decisions, maybe you were a victim of domestic violence and forced out by your husband at a time he predetermined to ensure he got custody (my bet) but that\u2019s in the past. \n\nYou\u2019ve allowed him to abuse you all this time and now you\u2019re allowing your daughter to do it. However y\u2019all ended up here, you\u2019re here and HERE is the only place you can work from. \n\nYour daughters grown, hold her responsible for her actions TODAY. Hold yourself responsible for your actions TODAY. And fuck your ex husband. He\u2019s literal shit. \n\nThis might not end up how you wanted but you\u2019re going to have to accept that. If you have to walk away, walk the fuck away. \n\nOP, I\u2019m sorry to tell you but they\u2019re only keeping you around so they can humiliate, degrade, and abuse you. You have to get out, hon. You have to go. You\u2019re not that scared underaged girl anymore so you have to stop acting like you\u2019re stuck like she was. \n\nYou deserve so much better, OP. And there is a special realm of hell for your ex husband, I promise you that.", "You had no way of knowing her friends would even be there, if she wanted to avoid intimacy she could\u2019ve just mentioned that and asked you to skip the PDA. It\u2019s on her, and her attitude, not you. If she wants boundaries that\u2019s fine, but she needs to talk to you about it. NTA", "Your ex has the script flipped. Your daughter has been trying to humiliate you with her classist attitude. I suggest you take a break from her, but let her know beforehand that you won\u2019t tolerate her behavior, she\u2019s way out of line. I\u2019m sorry, you don\u2019t deserve this.", "NTA\n\nWhy is your daughter ashamed of you? Why is your ex allowing such behavior? You are her MOTHER. Your education and job shouldn't matter. There is nothing wrong with working in the kitchen.\n\nYour ex put you down for such a long time that you think it's OK to pretend you are not related to your own daughter. \n\nWhy are you the one apologizing?\n\nYou need to talk with your ex and daughter and tell them that treating you like a lesser being is not OK.\n\nI am angry about the situation you found yourself in. They are both entitled, and I hope you stand up for yourself and don't allow them to bully you.\n\nFamily is not defined by blood. Family is made of people who accept you for who you are.", "NTA\n\nYou have nothing to be embarrassed about and neither does she. Working class people exist. Your daughter needs a serious attitude adjustment, but you've probably missed the opportunity. She needed it the very first time she acted like a spoiled little brat. Now it's been reinforced over time by you actually going along with her silly demand.", "NTA. So sorry your daughter is, though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Make no mistake, that fucker is trying to erase you from your kids life.", "NTA. You\u2019ve worked your ass off. You have a good job even with no degree and less work experience than most! Those are SUPER HARD hurdles to overcome in the work force. You\u2019ve kept this job for almost a decade. You pulled yourself up after a divorce where you were entirely dependent on the money of another human and are a successful and self-sufficient woman because of it. \n\nYour husband is pretentious and abusive and raise your daughter to be that as well. He\u2019s also convinced you that you have ANYTHING to be sorry for or ashamed of along the way.

In your shoes, I wouldn't be cooking anything for her. And I wouldn't be allowing her to dictate whether or not you speak to her if she comes in. She is quite happy to have a free meal but wants to pretend she doesn't know you? If this was a friend, you'd cut her off from the free meals immediately. I know she is your daughter but that doesn't give her the right to treat you so badly. \n\nShe doesn't like that you don't have a white collar job? Start being frank with her - she is old enough. Her dad got you pregnant basically straight out of high school. Your choice to keep her to term, and to push her ungrateful arse out into this world has DIRECTLY impacted on your life choices, your higher education options, your lack of career development and the work choices you have on the table as a result. And it was a choice. You chose to make her and to love her despite the hardships it might create for you. You sacrificed those career options for her, and for your husband's career. And it sounds like you did it willingly, but that does NOT give your daughter the right to throw them in your face. \n\nThese conversations may be hard but honestly with your ex for a father I think your daughter may need some help and support avoiding choosing someone like him as a partner and in 20 years finding herself in a similar situation you are in now - with a child, a scornful ex, and limited career options. She needs to get real about the world, about relationships, about work. At the moment she is living in a gross snobby fantasy created by her dad. \n\nThere is NOTHING wrong with bring a chef. Cooking like you do is a profession that has played a key role in society since antiquity. You work hard and earn your wages. Undoubtedly we currently live in a time when it is unappreciated and underpaid but that does not mean that your role doesn't have value. It does. It is important. You are important. And you matter and deserve dignity and respect regardless of what you do for a living.", "NTA I am sorry that your daughter was so cruel.
