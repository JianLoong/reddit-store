Your home is a place for you to relax and feel safe. IF you decided to try working with big dogs, there are lots of safe ways to do that which don\u2019t involve a random German Shepherd in your home for weeks. Does your gf know this dog\u2019s temperament? Health and vaccination status (ie rabies etc)? What is her plan to allow you space and breaks from the dog if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? What is her plan if the dog has separation anxiety while its owner is gone? Will she be assuming all responsibilities for the dog (walking, potty breaks, exercise, feeding, etc) while the dog is in her care so that you do not have to be involved?

I've never lived anywhere that didn't have a breed ban on German Sheppards (because they are NOT good apartment dogs). Most have also said you can't have non-leased animals inside without clearance from the office. This isn't the case everywhere but a German sheppard ain't easy to hide if he's not supposed to be there.", "I don't know.  But I'm 45 now and at the age of 30 o went in therapy for my fear of dogs.  She's a licensed psychologist and trained in phobias and has a dog for clients who want to work on their fear. It changed my life.  I don't have dogs as pets because I'm more of a cat and rat person but my life has open much more.  I am no longer living with this at all time. \n\nIts not a matter of asshole.", "NTA. I understand dog phobia. I used to be scared to DEATH of dogs since a bad incident from when I was a child. As time passed, I noticed that larger dogs with good owners are calm and gentle and loving. My neighbors had a Great Pyrenees and a Boxer. I learned to LOVE them. Especially the Boxer. I thought she had so much personality and it was hilarious when she\u2019d sass him back. So much that when I retired and got a Boxer. He\u2019s great. Sweet. Gentle. I\u2019m still scared of smaller dogs. Especially if the owner hasn\u2019t trained them well because those have more of a tendency to act out and bite. But just wanted to say that I understand and the phobia can be helped. GF was wrong though to force the issue.", "I would 100% cut her loose.

I love dogs and I too was terribly afraid as a child, my parents got a dog for that reason and now I love them all, even volunteering at shelters and fostering. So I can\u2019t be unbiased, and would never partner with someone who didn\u2019t love them as well.

It's an earned phobia for sure, but at the end of the day MOST dogs, 99.99% of dogs, won't maul you bud. \n\nIt's time to start tackling it, you've already made it your girlfriends problem this one time, she can't help her friend out.

They take time and effort to break, and, even then, a surprise can be a setback. It would be one thing if it were a Cocker Spaniel, which is smallish and not bred to be an attack dog, as German Shepherds are.\n\nIf you want to have a long-term relationship with her, talk to her. Explain how you feel, specifically, in the company of a large dog. Talk to her about the smell, the barking, and the teeth. This might ick you out, and it will bring those feelings out, but to make sure she knows you're not faking it, she needs to understand your phobia.\n\nIf you want to work on your phobia,  therapy is mental health and included in many employer-paid health plans.", "You\u2019re NTA.

Can you seek therapy for it?  For reference, I got bit by a German Shepherd square on the nuts when I was collecting subscription fees in my paper route when I was 11 and I understand as being in the doorway or a neighbor\u2019s home should be a safe place.  No damage was done but eff that dog, owner, and memory.  53m and I love big dogs now and I know all about them.  This understanding works both ways as they are gentle around me assuming they\u2019re domesticated and not mean spirited, etc.  They\u2019ve brought a lot of joy to my life. \n\nFunny thing is I hate small dogs that bark all the time - i.e. yappers - and I avoid chihuahuas at all costs, lol.

(I used to hold my breath; didn't even notice. My uncle didn't work on it or tell anyone and after getting a shot once he went into the bathroom and promptly fainted, breaking his nose on the way down.) The other phobia is courtrooms (childhood experience/trauma.) Since I don't have to deal with that much I haven't dealt with it much. Last time I tried going in a completely empty court room (because they aren't dangerous and part of me knows that) Mom said I literally went white and after a little more than a minute I had such a bad panic attack I not only left but Mom had to stop me from just walking away to nowhere fast and I was hyperventilating.

The same as its your decision how quickly you feel comfortable exposing yourself to your phobia. My husband would never belittle my reactions, he talks me through them, helps check me when I'm paranoid things are crawling on me, he even showed our daughter how to help me so if its only me and her I still have support and so she knows what's going on.

It\u2019s not that bad because she does not have the same fear. If the tables were turned and you did this same thing to her, she would be telling everyone what an insensitive ass you are. Why is it ok for a woman to be scared of something but not a guy? It\u2019s a total double standard.  Fear is fear and having a penis does not make a man exempt. Totally NTA.

Agreed she should of talked to you about it first. However, an ultimatum is any relationship is a red flag over a fight over power that may or may not have existed before you brought this toxic way to get you way in.\n\nIf you truly do not want to break up with your GF, take away the ultimatum and talk about how this feels to you, express that exposure therapy does not work like this and that it would not be good for the German Shepherds either who someone else talked about above, that could traumatise them and re-traumatise you.

You\u2019re already doing amazing with smaller dogs. Some exposure therapists can doing a program in as little as 3 months.

The idea is you are exposed to something a little more each time, but in tolerable doses. This builds your courage. Extremely effective when done right. Like building a muscle. \n\nOverexposing someone immediately and for a long period of time just leads to overdosing. Which is not sucks because one hasn't built the tolerance and courage needed to be in that moment comfortably, instead their nervous system kicks them into a constant state of fight or flight/anxiety/panic. This is an involuntary biological response. The body does it whether one likes it or not, in response to particular stimuli. \n\nExposure therapy has the goal of inner peace, or at least increased tolerance in the environment of the thing, overdose leads to panic and fight or flight amygdala hijacking. \n\nSounds like the GF needs an education.

I'm working on an issue I have watching media surrounding drowning depictions. It's the last in a long line of work after a near drowning incident when I was teen. I can swim and be around water fine, but watching a dramatization of drowning is still too close for comfort. \n\nMy therapist is working with me to find mild depictions and I'm watching them in my own time, supervised by my husband, and then talking with my therapist during our weekly meetings. I can't very well sit with her for a whole movie or an hour of TV, so this is a better option. \n\nIt really varies depending on what you're working on.", "Pretty much. The important part is to keep your stress and anxiety levels low to zero when revisiting the traumatic memory, otherwise it can make the trauma worse.", "I am not a professional in any sense but as I understand it: it's a method of working past extreme phobias. A licensed professional will work with their patient on exposing themselves **slowly** to thing that triggers them. There's a lot of trust required in the process and the person going through the therapy needs to be able to disengage with the triggering thing at will, the goal is the work your way up, not throw yourself full in and potentially worsen the phobia.\n\nIn someone like Op's case it would probably consist of interacting with smaller dogs at first, growing confidence and comfortability there. And then potentially they would work their way to say, hanging out in a room with a Very Well Trained bigger dog sitting with a handler on a short leash on the other side of the room and just do that until that's tolerable. and then slowly close the distance until they're comfy with it. A quick search online shows it takes an average of 3 months though I've heard from other sources that it can take much longer depending on the severity of the phobia and other compounding factors.", "Maybe OP will ask her and will update with her reasoning.
