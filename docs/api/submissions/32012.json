Your home is a place for you to relax and feel safe. IF you decided to try working with big dogs, there are lots of safe ways to do that which don\u2019t involve a random German Shepherd in your home for weeks. Does your gf know this dog\u2019s temperament? Health and vaccination status (ie rabies etc)? What is her plan to allow you space and breaks from the dog if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? What is her plan if the dog has separation anxiety while its owner is gone? Will she be assuming all responsibilities for the dog (walking, potty breaks, exercise, feeding, etc) while the dog is in her care so that you do not have to be involved?

I've never lived anywhere that didn't have a breed ban on German Sheppards (because they are NOT good apartment dogs). Most have also said you can't have non-leased animals inside without clearance from the office. This isn't the case everywhere but a German sheppard ain't easy to hide if he's not supposed to be there.", "I don't know.  But I'm 45 now and at the age of 30 o went in therapy for my fear of dogs.  She's a licensed psychologist and trained in phobias and has a dog for clients who want to work on their fear. It changed my life.  I don't have dogs as pets because I'm more of a cat and rat person but my life has open much more.  I am no longer living with this at all time. \n\nIts not a matter of asshole.", "NTA. I understand dog phobia. I used to be scared to DEATH of dogs since a bad incident from when I was a child. As time passed, I noticed that larger dogs with good owners are calm and gentle and loving. My neighbors had a Great Pyrenees and a Boxer. I learned to LOVE them. Especially the Boxer. I thought she had so much personality and it was hilarious when she\u2019d sass him back. So much that when I retired and got a Boxer. He\u2019s great. Sweet. Gentle. I\u2019m still scared of smaller dogs. Especially if the owner hasn\u2019t trained them well because those have more of a tendency to act out and bite. But just wanted to say that I understand and the phobia can be helped. GF was wrong though to force the issue.", "I would 100% cut her loose. You told her no, she countered told you your fear wasn't a fear - told you to get over it, then got upset when you stuck to your boundaries. \n\nShe will stomp all over them for the rest of your relationship.

No one should force you to do something you don't want to.....phobia or not.", "I see both sides. She cares about her friend and dog, but you did offer to stay elsewhere. I love dogs and I too was terribly afraid as a child, my parents got a dog for that reason and now I love them all, even volunteering at shelters and fostering. So I can\u2019t be unbiased, and would never partner with someone who didn\u2019t love them as well. But I do understand fears in general, and you have every right to not partner with someone who loves dogs. To me, that\u2019s right up there with do you both want kids or not. A deal breaker. Something couples have to work out.", "NTA - But consider this a sign you need to start working on your phobia. It's an earned phobia for sure, but at the end of the day MOST dogs, 99.99% of dogs, won't maul you bud. \n\nIt's time to start tackling it, you've already made it your girlfriends problem this one time, she can't help her friend out.

Your girlfriend knows your situation.  \n\nHowever.  There are treatments for phobias.  After a while it does seem like hey, why not at least try to get past this thing that will only cause me problems in the future?", "She could have done a better job of that conversation. \n\nPhobias are real. They take time and effort to break, and, even then, a surprise can be a setback. It would be one thing if it were a Cocker Spaniel, which is smallish and not bred to be an attack dog, as German Shepherds are.\n\nIf you want to have a long-term relationship with her, talk to her. Explain how you feel, specifically, in the company of a large dog. Talk to her about the smell, the barking, and the teeth. This might ick you out, and it will bring those feelings out, but to make sure she knows you're not faking it, she needs to understand your phobia.\n\nIf you want to work on your phobia,  therapy is mental health and included in many employer-paid health plans.", "You\u2019re NTA. I was going to defend her though but then she has the nerve to tell you \u201cjust to get over it\u201d and right there we have an unreasonable person who is ignorant of more than just this.\n\nThat being said dogs of all sizes are a huge part of American culture and you will experience this type of fear over and over again.  Can you seek therapy for it?  For reference, I got bit by a German Shepherd square on the nuts when I was collecting subscription fees in my paper route when I was 11 and I understand as being in the doorway or a neighbor\u2019s home should be a safe place.  No damage was done but eff that dog, owner, and memory.  53m and I love big dogs now and I know all about them.  This understanding works both ways as they are gentle around me assuming they\u2019re domesticated and not mean spirited, etc.  They\u2019ve brought a lot of joy to my life. \n\nFunny thing is I hate small dogs that bark all the time - i.e. yappers - and I avoid chihuahuas at all costs, lol.  Wiener dogs give me the creeps too.", "Info: are u in therapy for this?", "Is there a reason you refuse to make an effort to get over your phobia?

She can not decide for you that you are ready to do something like that.

Also, getting rid of the phobia or even lessening it can take months to YEARS. She wanted you to be on the verge of a panic attack in your own home for a few WEEKS?!\n\nI have 2 phobias. One is needles (shots, even using a sewing needle to remove a splinter.) I've gotten better to the point where the doctor or nurse doesn't worry about me passing out when I get a shot. (I used to hold my breath; didn't even notice. My uncle didn't work on it or tell anyone and after getting a shot once he went into the bathroom and promptly fainted, breaking his nose on the way down.) The other phobia is courtrooms (childhood experience/trauma.) Since I don't have to deal with that much I haven't dealt with it much. Last time I tried going in a completely empty court room (because they aren't dangerous and part of me knows that) Mom said I literally went white and after a little more than a minute I had such a bad panic attack I not only left but Mom had to stop me from just walking away to nowhere fast and I was hyperventilating.

I'm 28, and it's only gotten worse. I'm not ready for exposure therapy and it's no one's decision but mine if I'm ever going to be ready for that. The same as its your decision how quickly you feel comfortable exposing yourself to your phobia. My husband would never belittle my reactions, he talks me through them, helps check me when I'm paranoid things are crawling on me, he even showed our daughter how to help me so if its only me and her I still have support and so she knows what's going on. Your partner should be your support in your mental health, not belittle it, undermine it or show frustration if you aren't where they want you to be. I still feel a bit uncomfortable telling my sister my reactions and she's gotten a lot better and more understanding.

It\u2019s not that bad because she does not have the same fear. If the tables were turned and you did this same thing to her, she would be telling everyone what an insensitive ass you are. Why is it ok for a woman to be scared of something but not a guy? It\u2019s a total double standard.  Fear is fear and having a penis does not make a man exempt. Totally NTA.
