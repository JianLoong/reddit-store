Everyone got their invitations last year and the dress code was clearly listed as \u2018formal/cocktail\u2019, perfect there are so many options to respect this!\n\nLast week when all our siblings, five in total, were at our parents for dinner the topic of James wedding came up. I mentioned I\u2019d found a dress I\u2019d love to show her. A simple long green slip dress. Later on Jane pulled me aside and told me that I couldn\u2019t wear that dress, or any other dress for that matter. She told me she had thought about it and she\u2019d prefer it if I just wore black jeans and a black sweatshirt/t-shirt. \n\nI was a bit baffled and initially thought she was joking. Turns out she wasn\u2019t. She told me I\u2019m not allowed to dress up or wear makeup, at all. While I\u2019m very comfortable in my own skin, this felt both absurd to me and frankly made me very sad. When I asked why she told me she resented me for being beautiful and athletic. I told her she was stunning in her own way, just like everyone else is and that no one would be looking at me on her big day, but if she made me wear casual clothes I would stick out like a sore thumb. \n\nJane said she wasn\u2019t changing her mind and that she wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable if I dressed up even a little and that it was the same reason she hadn\u2019t made me a bridesmaid. She said multiple of her friends had asked about me, and she even contemplated wether to inviting me at all because she was afraid her friends would hit on me. She also said the reason she\u2019s never taken me up on invites for her and Mark was because she was afraid I\u2019d try and steal him. \n\nWhile I recognize this probably comes from a place of insecurity, it deeply hurt me she thinks that little of my character and that she\u2019d rather ridicule me on her big day to make herself look better at an event that\u2019s already entirely about her. I\u2019d never do anything to challenge that and frankly, she knows this. I have never, and would never deliberately seek attention at any event for someone else, let alone my sister. \n\nI told her if she has that big an issue with me being there that I have to wear jeans and a sweatshirt I don\u2019t need to be there at all. She said I was trying to outshine her by wanting to dress up and that I was being selfish and cruel.  AITA?\n\nEdit: typos, English isn\u2019t my first language\n\nEDIT 2: Well okay, seems like everyone thinks I made this up\u2026 Thank you to everyone who replied with genuine intention, it at least cleared things up a little for me. I don\u2019t know what to make of my sisters actions but I\u2019ll be thinking twice about attending. I appreciate the feedback I received from those with real advice, and I\u2019ll probably be logging off now.

Who would have a formal wedding and actually want someone showing up in jeans and a sweatshirt? It doesn't even sound plausible.", "NTA.  Your sister is way too insecure.  She can invite who she wants and even set a dress code.  She can even single you out and demand that, if you attend, you must mask who you are.  (Still makes her TA).  Nothing secret about the demand, so out her on this publicly when you announce you will not be attending, so you control the narrative.", "Part of me thinks you are leaving out something because I can't imagine your sister could be this insecure and you would have no previous clue about it.\n\nBased on what is reported, I'd say the best course of action is to not attend and make it clear WHY you are not attending to any parents and siblings.  You aren't attending because your sister is being rude, controlling and trying to single you out for harassment.  (Does she think no one is going to comment on how underdressed you are?)   Not making you a bridesmaid is totally reasonable no matter what your relationship is.  Making you dress like a slob at a formal event is an attack and is coming from a place of abuse, not insecurity.", "NTA- You aren't trying to outshine her, you're wanting to fit the dress code.  \n If you are too ungodly hot to attend her wedding as a normal guest then it truly is noble of you to ensure you are at least several blocks away at the time. Y'know, like a greek nymph.", "this sounds like a made up story. No body with such deep insecurities will tell the object of it that they don't want their beautiful athletic body there, or to wear jeans to a wedding.\n\nNot believable at all.", "NTA. She is being disgustingly resentful. It's completely unfair that she wants you to wear a potato sack and Kleenex boxes for shoes. Tell her that you will dress appropriately for the occasion or not go at all.", "NTA. It\u2019s hard to believe this is real. If you were to wear black jeans and a black T shirt, as she ridiculously suggested, you would be the focus of a lot of attention and discussion. If you follow the dress code, you\u2019ll blend in with the guests and the focus will be on the bride. \n\nIf she won\u2019t let you wear a dress, then don\u2019t go, and make sure you\u2019ve told everyone you know who\u2019s going why you won\u2019t be there, so your sister doesn\u2019t tell a different story.", "This is either not real, or there is far more to this story than is being told.", "There's no way this is true lol", "Anyone who says you're the asshole is gunna get an ass whipping from me cause you sure as hell aren't the ahole.\n\nYour sis is insecure about herself to the point it's bleeding into her relationship with her own sister?

Her partner will most likely be in a very controlling relationship/marriage. Your sister's internal problems shouldn't affect other people. If you decide to adjust yourself to this behaviour, it will give her a window to *avoid* facing her internal issues. Obviously, this is not the way, it can escalate into emotional abuse, or worse. I do applause you for not judging her, or express your judgements to her, this will make it worse since she will not see it as feedback in order to work on her problems, but she will see it as an attack(You are trying outshine me. You are selfish and cruel) Don't feed this behaviour, this is a tragic expression of her internal issues.  \nShe will do well by visiting a therapist.", "NTA . Your sister is having a huge case of wedding sickness.\n\nyou are not responsible of her insecurities.\n\nwhat does it matter if her friends hit on you ? She is the one getting married after all. It shouldn\u2019t matter if her friends find you attractive, it\u2019s not like she can store them up for later.\n\nbesides, as you already pointed it out, standing in casual clothes during a formal event will make you stand out. Maybe she hopes that people will remember this of you, that you didn\u2019t even bother to cleanup for her wedding.", "\"she\u2019d prefer it if I just wore black jeans and a black sweatshirt/t-shirt.\"\n\nHey, why stop there? Sackcloth and ashes is the way to go! / sarc\n\nSeriously, your sister has issues. And having you dress that way would make you a center of attention at the wedding for sure. Have you talked to your mother about it? If your sister insists on this I wouldn't go either.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I think not going or going with you following the actual dress code for the event are the only two options. \n\nHow sad that she somehow thinks your mere existence near her on that day is enough for people to not pay attention to her, the actual bride. She must really have zero self-confidence. \n\nAnd how sad for you to be scapegoated and blamed for her insecurities.", "End her suspense. Just fuck her fianc\u00e9 and get it over with.", "NTA. Your sister needs therapy, and I\u2019m not even making that as a flippant remark.

Please do show up to her wedding in jeans and a sweatshirt because people will be paying way more attention to you than if you wore a dress.\n\nNTA. (Honestly,  the fact that she was even thinking about not inviting you in the first place makes her a grade A asshole.)", "NTA. Your sister clearly has huge insecurity issues, and if you can't persuade her to allow you to attend wearing a simple dress, jewellery and makeup then don't go.\n\nAs you know, turning up in jeans and a t-shirt to her wedding where everyone else will be in cocktail attire will only draw more attention to you and by extension to her. Do both of you a favour and don't bring that on yourselves.", "Her insecurity and jealousy is not your problem to fix. Let's face it: what she really wants  is if you didn't come, and if you were never within 1000 miles of her fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe hell with her. Politely decline the invite.\n\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. This Bridezilla needs a wake-up call. You can't help genetics.", "NTA. honestly if i was you id make sure to look like absolute shit and be in as many pictures as possible.", "NTA....wrf. she's so jealous and insecure it isn't even funny.   Stick to the published dress code and wear that amazing dress.  Eff that jeans noise.  Her issues aren't your problem.", "NTA - it's not because it's her wedding that you can't put your foot down after unreasonable demands. And this is one. I would not go and be honest about why to your family.", "NTA this is a weird request and if she's this insecure about her looks and specifically about being compared to you, she needs to work on herself a Lot. She's afraid you'll steal her fianc\u00e9?? That's beyond irrational, and an indicator that she's not ready for marriage tbh.", "NTA. She can make any request she wants of her guests, but you certainly don't have to go along with it. If embarrassing her sister is her top priority on her wedding day, she should consider getting some therapy. She doesn't sound mature enough for marriage.", "NTA\n\nUh, so unless we're missing something, your sister has a case of the bridezillas. I'm also going to guess that Mark may have made some comments at some point which is feeding her jealousy and insecurity. \n\nDrop the subject but if she brings it up, tell her what she wants to hear, for now. It's possible she will relax about this between now and the wedding. The fact that she pulled you aside to express this ridiculous demand means she knows she's being ridiculous and doesn't want other people to see this behavior.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, wear 'formal/cocktail' as wearing anything else would also be a distraction. Since you are not in the wedding party, she really isn't going to see you all that much. Sit with family so that she keeps her reaction in check. It will be your mothers, the bridesmaid's and her husband's problem to deal with her. \n\nIn the spirit of diplomacy, perhaps don't get the green slip dress. Do you have other sisters or sisters in laws? Perhaps find out what they are wearing, without telling them why, and wear something similar. \n\nGood luck to you (and her fianc\u00e9 and bridesmaids)!", "NTA- Yes, you will stick out badly if you go with the outfit she suggested. And people will talk about that more than if you just blended in. She sounds really insecure, and honestly like maybe she isn't ready to get married if she excludes you from hanging out with her and her fiance for the reason of her being afraid of you stealing him.", "NTA\n\nWhat does she expect you to say when people inevitably ask why you haven't dressed up for your sister's wedding?  I'd definitely be telling everyone the real reason. \n\nWith her insecurity and lack of trust in her future husband I can't see this marriage lasting very long.", "Nta, I would suggest wearing a barney costume to the wedding to show her how ridiculous she is being.", "NTA. That's heartbreaking. I'd be tempted to go in a black sweatshirt and black jeans and tell everyone who asks that you're wearing what the bride requested. Everyone will know exactly what that means.", "NTA Your sister is just jealous of you and is scared of having the attention drawn away from her.", "NTA i bet if you did go and comply to her outlandish demands, she would then put you on the spot for NOT dressing up.\n\n\u201cOh my own sister couldn\u2019t even dress up for my wedding! How mean of her!\u201d\n\ni think this is a dammed if you do, dammed if you don\u2019t situation. but your sister is very horrid for projecting her insecurities onto you like that. Like, she\u2019s gonna be the star, it\u2019s her wedding.", "NTA - just don\u2019t attend. Don\u2019t make a scene about it either. She's going to be embarrassed enough having to explain this to anyone. She wasn\u2019t sure she even wanted you to attend? That was it for me.", "NTA, but please don't go. Whatever you put on and whatever happens during that day, your sister will not be happy (because she is looking for it) and she will blame you", "NTA. She is though. And you\u2019re right, you\u2019d stick out more if you were to dress the way she wants. You\u2019re a guest. Not part of the wedding party. She can\u2019t impose a dress code on you.", "NTA.

It both makes me incredibly sad and pisses me off, I don\u2019t know what what to think or do.", "See, my first thought was that OP was trans and the sister was wanting her to dress according to birth gender and that detail was left out for some reason. But I agree, something is fishy about this post.", "Not saying I disagree with the rest of your comment\u2026but everyone I grew up with and my whole family uses \u201ccourted.\u201d", "People court all the time in religious circles and the south - but go off", "English is not her first language.

A small handful maybe? Still doesn't make any sense.", "This makes it sound even more fake! No one would want their sister to spend the whole night being mistaken for a waiter!

And there's a difference between wearing a simple or plain dress and wearing black jeans and sweatshirt in a sea of formal/ cocktail wear. OF COURSE people will talk. \n\nJane seems to want people to laugh at you on her big day. Her jealousy is out of control. Your dad and brothers are right. Don't go.", "Why does she care if her friends hit on you? She's not marrying any of them.", "I really find it hard to believe your mother went along with Jane\u2019s plan. Surely a grown woman would know how ridiculous a suggestion it is.", "I am almost serious. The worst part of any fearfulness is waiting every day for it to happen. When it happens it's often a kind of *relief*. At that point you can deal with it. Like someone with a new car, and they are terrified of getting it scratched: it's probably a *kindness* to key the damn thing for them and then they can get on with their life.", "So she wants you to blend in with the staff?\n\nJust don't go.\n\nThis is the hill to go no contact on.\n\nShe is so jealous of you that nothing will change...don't go....and if anyone freaks out about it,  just tell them the truth.", "Explanation to husband: \"She's wearing that to ensure you don't ogle her during the ceremony.\"\n\nExplanation to other bridesmaids who are asking why her sister isn't part of the bridal party: \"She's not a bridesmaid because she's prettier than me, whereas you're all ugly so ...\"", "Sammies.", "Really?
