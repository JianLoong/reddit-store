If he's paying 1200/mo in rent to them, it's not really leeching just because it's not market rate. It's very possible your parents see the arrangement as mutually beneficial. They like the rent money, the help with errands, and the company, and they like that they are helping out their son too. If he's been contributing to their household expenses for years it also makes sense for him to receive some greater proportion of the value of the house if its sold.
