The frequency is what drives me insane. It's easily once every 5 seconds and can last on the upwards of an hour, if not more. The only time he stops is if I come up with solutions to curb his boredom and to be blunt, I'm getting tired of coming up with solutions when I'm not the one who needs them. BUT he also has severe ADHD and he says that when he gets in to those moments, the sighing becomes a stimming thing and he doesn't realize he's doing it and he also stated that when he gets like that, it's like he's incapable of coming up with solutions himself because his brain will not let him think about anything other than why he is pissed off. So I get that this very well could be an ADHD problem but that doesn't make it any less frustrating for me. \n\nSo basically I have spoken to him several times in the past stating that it's not my job to come up with solutions for him and that I'm tired of the extra burden of even more decision making. I mean, every single decision in this house falls on me. Even dinner ideas and if he doesn't like what I suggest, he will ask me to come up with something else. It's just exhausting and he knows I'm sick of it.\n\nSo I have frequent nightmares from my PTSD and I lose a lot of sleep. So yesterday morning I was up at 1:30ish AM due to nightmares and I refused to go back asleep because I just didn't want to close my eyes after that one because it was bad. So I'm exhausted all day. My fiance knows this. And he just randomly starts angry sighing out of the blue so I turn to him and sharply say \"What now? What can possibly be wrong this time?\" I was definitely mean about it and have since apologized for that bit because my lack of sleep is not his problem. But then he just said he was bored and kept angry sighing so I told him I didn't want to deal with this right now and he says \"neither do I\" but kept doing it so I just took off. He says I'm immature because I know he can't help it when he gets in to his stimming modes and I should have just helped him find solutions. I told him I'm done finding him solutions and that he should probably keep a journal with ideas to keep him entertained so he isnt giving the people around him a migraine and burdening them with even more responsibility that shouldn't even be theirs. AITA?\n\nETA: he refuses therapy and the only meds he is on is medical marijuana. He only smokes at night however so during the day he has no \"crutch\" and often angry sighs about the smallest of inconveniences because he can't mentally work it out in his head.

Your fianc\u00e9's condition is severe, but that doesn't mean he can't make an attempt to help you with the decisions instead of always expecting you to make them, and then negating them when he doesn't like them.\n\nIt was a good idea suggesting a journal, there are planner journals for people with ADHD, and maybe you could buy one for him so that at the very least he could look through and/or write in it when he gets bored. \n\nIt's also understandable that you're irritated because of your lack of sleep, and it doesn't sound like your fianc\u00e9 is being empathetic to your issues or needs. He really does need to figure out a way to relieve his own boredom, because you won't always be there to think up ideas for him, and he shouldn't expect you to just because you're in a relationship. \n\nWhat will he do if you have a job and you're out all day? If you're out visiting and he's at home? If you have a doctor or therapist appointment and he's on his own for a few hours? If you're in hospital for a few days? If you have a kid, which takes up all your time and attention? What would he do if you broke up and you weren't there anymore to make suggestions and decisions?\n\nI think you should stop making suggestions, and invest in some noise cancelling earbuds so you can put your music on when he starts angry sighing. Yes, he can't help it, but you don't have to listen to it. \n\nIf he isn't finding strategies to relieve his boredom, it really isn't your job to do it  for him. He's a grown adult capable of making, or at least helping with, these decisions, and the more you leave him to come up with solutions for his boredom, the better he will become at it.\n\nMaybe, to help him, stick a sheet of paper on the fridge with THINGS TO DO WHEN I'M BORED and a list of all the things that have worked in the past. And then leave him to be responsible for checking that list, doing the things on it and adding to it. \n\nDo make a concerted effort to make less decisions.

Two things: have you evaluated how you'd handle this relationship long term, with someone who refuses responsibility for their own health (think of when you have kids) and can you get into a different type of therapy?

He needs to learn to at least try instead of putting the complete management of his ADHD on your plate.", "NAH. You both are struggling with your own health issues. You may not have handled this with excelled grave in this moment, but it sounds like you typically do. When we're exhausted, it's hard for any of us to be at our best. Where you showed grace was apologizing for your behavior. It shows an awareness of who you are.\n\nYour fiance doesn't seem to have as much awareness. He asks for you to make allowances for his diagnosis, but doesn't cut you slack for your problem of PTSD. You might want to point that out and not let him get away with it.\n\nI know quite a few people with ADHD. The ones who are well-adjusted and don't need entertaining are those who have a \"hobby\" to focus on. Maybe you can find one for your fiance? One friend is into fixing up old cars. He spends a ton of time fixing the engines, installing interior, painting, etc. Another I know is obsessed with all things football. He watches professional and college ball. He participates in fantasy leagues. He watches some games in sports bars, making it a game to figure out which place has the best wings. Ball ends in January, but magazines and coverage starts again in June to talk about Draft Picks. It's a 4 month hiatus that he usually travels in. Another friend, she's into photography. She takes pictures of all kinds of things. She watches videos on photography. She reads articles on them. She attends classes and seminars on photography. She posts some amazing pictures. Another friend is into music. He's like my friend with photography, watching videos about equipment and styles, if not outright music videos or about musicians. He's always tinkering with music, hearing it everywhere, and had been creating music for years.\n\nMaybe he'd be less bored if he had a thing to focus on.

Make decisions that you're happy making and leave the rest to him. \n\nHonestly, I get that his ADHD is severe, but it sounds like he's taking the piss and using you as a doormat because he knows you've always done everything in the past. If he's not going to change his approach, you have to change yours, be adamant, and not cave to his demands. \n\nCan you see yourself living like this for the next 30 years? Because if he's like this now, do you think it's going to change once you're married? It will just get worse, especially when you have more responsibilities like kids, a job, even a pet. \n\nYou'll exhaust yourself running around him while he lets you, just like he's letting you run your nerves ragged now.

He should really take some responsibility in taking care of himself.  You're not his caretaker. This does seem like something you two need to resolve before getting married since it's already causing resentment. Definitely not an easy issue to resolve.", "[removed]", "Definitely NTA then. \n\nPlease tell him to go to therapy if he can afford it.
