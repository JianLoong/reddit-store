Any time your name has been mentioned in a school program or class mom volunteer acknowledgment? I would say that is a comparable level of accomplishment, the work and effort you put in to volunteer your unpaid labor, time, and love to your children\u2019s social or educational group.

Then when we do accomplish something great we are taught to make ourselves smaller so we do not emasculate the men in our lives, while men by no means are taught to give us the same consideration. Our unpaid labor is taken for granted while men are applauded for providing an income, even when both partners work women do a disproportionate amount of childcare and household management without gratitude but instead expectations, men are permitted to have \u2018fun budgets\u2019 while women are expected to spend their money on children and groceries, men get \u2018man caves\u2019 while women are allowed to \u2018decorate the kitchen and bedroom\u2019, men get time to decompress after work while women make dinner.
