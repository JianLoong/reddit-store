When we were celebrating her milestone she did a toast and mentioned my stepfather: \u201eand let\u2019s also think of X who 5 years ago achieved ABC. Remember it\u2019s the little things in life\u201c. It was hilarious. \nI\u2019m all for an open and honest discussion, but if you want to be petty, hang your diploma and his obscure quote next to each other in the living room.

Interesting.\u201c\n\nCongrats for being awesome!", "You deserve to bask in the goddamn light--you raised his kids AND got a law degree!

Tell him his pettiness is unnattractive.", "Have you told him how this looks/feels, regardless of his intent?", "And like\u2026why does it have to hang right next your degree in the office that YOU will be using? If he really wants to hang it up that bad, why can\u2019t it be literally anywhere else in the house?", "To dissuade him, suggest another location with the seemingly generous intention of not wanting to outshine him by putting it right next to your degree, all the while actually pointing out how paltry his \u201caccomplishment\u201d is.", "Yes! Plus most places do law degrees on large papers, and state law licenses are often even bigger. Mat those bad boys up larger. Consider admission to a federal bar or two and give them the same framing.

Wife's bright shiny diploma, and all hubby has to compare is a worn old piece of newspaper.", "Why the Y T A?", "It'd be better there than next to her LAW DEGREE.

Im imagining its 1 of those free news papers that they can barely give away to people", ">YTA, for putting down something your husband is really proud of. Its just a picture and a line, its nothing to be proud of and doesn't deserve to be on our shared office wall, is what you sound like. You sound like an attention needy teenager, I need all of the attention, no one else's accomplishments can be recognized because mine is the hardest and the best. You should be happy for both of your accomplishments and be happy they are next to each other. Did he not hang the newspaper clipping because the office has been a wreck and nothing was being put on walls like you had mentioned?", "Don\u2019t forget, there are a lot of kids on here who have no concept of the sacrifice and dedication this accomplishment took. Your husband is probably used to being the bread winner/big dog. He can chill and empower his wife now.", "I went back to law school at 35 so I know it's not what people are thinking.  It means more to you and it should.", "He should frame it and hang it in *his* office at work.", "If you're the only person who goes in there, he doesn't get to mark territory with his article.  He can put it anywhere in the house he likes, except your private office.", "Wait if you are the person using that office why does he want to hang it there? That sounds a bit pushy of him.", "Wait wait wait. He wants his 10 year old newspaper quote to hang in *your* office? Is he going to let you hang your diploma in *his* office?", ">Haha, thanks. This office is hidden and I'm the only person who goes in there. My attorney job is remote so I'll be working from that office.\n\nI don't know if the term is so common these days, but when I was in law school, it was pretty normal to look forward to hanging the diploma on an \"I love me wall\" in your office.  That wall is all about \\*your\\* accomplishments.  \n\nYour husband can have his own where he works.  There might even be a way to find a better-looking copy of the article, have it nicely framed, and give it to him to put up in his own office.", "He like he's going through insecurity issues.  You need to claim the room as yours!  \n\nI'd copy and frame his article hang it all over the house, including the bathroom.", "Can you please hang it somewhere more prominent? It just deserves that. And so do you.", "I think this is the area you should press on. This is your personal space and workplace. Why does he need to do it, and why now all of a sudden?\n\nMy guess (and he may not admit it) is he might be a little jealous of your accomplishment. He might have a big and flashy job, but there\u2019s not many roles like doctor and lawyers that come with automatic prestige. He very well could have been genuinely supportive until it actually happened. You might feel he\u2019s important, but maybe he\u2019s worried he won\u2019t look like breadwinner / family accomplished one anymore? And you did that impressive feat while you were raising the kids during the day at night.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but you should peel back the onion layers on this one. While your accomplishment might make him feel temporarily insecure, it\u2019s not the time and place to fight relevance. \n\nWhen my career was stalled, I was happy to see my boyfriends take off. I made much more than him, but he was paving the way on his while I felt like I have been stalled for a long time. While there were minor periods I felt a little envious and discouraged in my own path, I never once showed jealousy and showed nothing but happiness and support. I was able to recognize those feelings were based on my own feelings of worth in my own career. I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to brag and showcase my relevance when he finally had a moment.\n\nWhile you can look to find the root of this issue, I wouldn\u2019t back down. It\u2019s immature and hurtful\u2026and he should know and recognize what you have sacrificed all these years.", "Oh yes, the expectation was that \\*I\\* frame it for him.", "Then I would take his push pin and his clipping and move it somewhere fitting - such as over the toilet so every time he pees he can marvel at his accomplishments", "It's our shared home, but I am the only one who works in there. I added more info to the post to explain that.", "He wants to hang his accomplishment up in *her* office. He won't be using it.\n\n>This office is hidden and I'm the only person who goes in there. My attorney job is remote so I'll be working from that office.", "Him having a quote in the newspaper is exciting and all. Like when it happened, but ten years later that is no accomplishment and definitely not anything to be remotely compared to getting a law degree. \n\nI have been quoted and interviewed in the newspaper several times. Oh pictures too, but those were promptly cut out and laminated by family and I had them on display for a bit, then decided to pack them into a memory box. \n\nIf the law degree made OPs husband get sentimental that\u2019s fine, he can display his degree in his workplace or the article or whatever. He wanted to dim her light and that\u2019s not fair. Even if unintentionally.", "He had 10 years to hang up the article if he wanted to. All of a sudden he decides it has to go up when OP got her law degree. \n\nShe's not the insecure one here.", "It's her office where she'll be doing her remote lawyering and he doesn't use it. \n\nHe's trying to hang his memorabilia up in her office.", "The husband got too used to being the one with all the accolades and can\u2019t stand the thought of wifey being successful", "Shared house but not shared office, only she uses it. She clarifies that in a comment.", "It\u2019s in their shared house, but it going to be her office since she is going to be working from home and will be the only one using it. So, why would OPs husband put up an old article after ten years in a space that he will not use, but will the epicenter of his wife\u2019s new professional career after years of her sacrificing and supporting him?", "No it\u2019s her office, in a home they share.", "If it mattered so much he would have hung it up years ago. And it\u2019s her office. She will be the only one using it, since she will be working from home.", "My read is that it's a shared office as in it's at the house they both live in. However, it is the office where she will be doing HER work as an attorney. From the sounds of the post and her replies, her husband has his own office somewhere, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to hang his thing there, or literally anywhere else in the house, so that her office is dedicated to her own work. If her office was not at home, no one would be suggesting that she should hang anything belonging to her husband there.", "They don't share the office. The office is in their home, but it's her office for work. She says he doesn't even go in there.", "You're right. I think instead you should put this above your mantel and require your husband to bow to it every time he walks in the living room. JFK.", "Wow you sound petty. It's not enough that you accomplish something, but you need to use that to lessen the things he does.", "And while you were doing all that he was supporting you & your kids financially. I'll bet he popped buttons off his shirt with pride when you achieved your dream & got that degree. But his quote in an article is too lowly to hang in the same room?", "And your feelings are entirely valid.", "No, you seem to think it's only about you.  You need to have your equal time of being congratulated.   You should put a big spotlight on your degree to make sure everyone notices it.", "I noticed you ignored the most important part. Again, how does your husband posting this take literally anything away from you? Your degree isn't less impressive because your husband was written up in a news paper.\n\n>He never had an opinion on anything related to the house until I earned a degree I'm proud of and want to hang. Now all of a sudden he has an interest in decor.\n\nIt's not that weird. Maybe he never thought about the idea that any of you *could* post your achievements on walls. Maybe, as you said, the office was super cluttered, and now that you're re-organizing. Maybe he knew that any of his ideas he'd actually want anywhere else in the house would have been shot down, so he didn't bother. Maybe this is literally the only piece of decor he cares about (which would make it even more of a dick move to deny him IMO). IDK, i'd have to ask him about how he feels about the decor of the house. It's pretty common for men to not care and/or get steamrolled when they do.", "You should watch the episode of modern family where Mitch wins and award and cam finally hangs his as well. He didn\u2019t hang his in the past because Mitch didn\u2019t have anything and he didn\u2019t want to make him self conscious about it. NAH but I think you should let him hang it", "Dude it was sarcasm", "It\u2019s in there shared home, but it\u2019s her office since she works from home and husband won\u2019t need the office.", "Being able to be proud of each other's accomplishments is a good thing not saying mine is better than yours. It doesn't really matter not my situation", "That tells me everything I need to know. Congrats on the degree tho", "Because the office was in a \"shambles\"", "That\u2019s a fair point - I think I glossed over in reading that it was her office. In that case NTA - wanting your space to be your own is completely understandable.\n\nI still would recommend actually talking to the partner though - these kind of issues can usually be resolved with a transparent conversation.", "It kinda seems that way to me while maybe the husband is proud of both and wants two important memories for him next to each other.", "[deleted]", "Oh well, in that case, NTA! It\u2019s super weird that he wants to do that and would be out of place in her office used for her legal work.", "What a legend!", "If the article DOES have his pic, suggest hanging his in the bedroom b/c it's such a turn on when she sees her famous hubby, or something along those lines \ud83e\udd23.\n\nNTA, btw.  Or just do a total remodel of the office and declare that it's just hers.", "Love this. Petty but with plausible deniability.", "Cause that was sarcasm lol", "I think they meant NTA", "Mr. Sleazeball Luke Dunphy is definitely the worst kid in that show.", "He can do that himself :)", "It's not a shared office, though. It's her home office. He wants to hang his article in her office when (I'm assuming, since OP mentions her husband's job is prestigious) he can hang it on his own office wall.", "Like she said, his accomplishments come in the form of bonuses, trips, public praise, etc. Her\u2019s can be hung on a wall. A crusty newspaper clipping with a single quote makes him look petty when he\u2019s enjoyed his rewards for a while now.", "So the office was such a wreck that there was no space on the wall?  \nMust be a disaster over there.", "NTA, \n\nmaybe get a nice photo of your husband and your kids to hang next to it. \n\nIt's your office to decide what is on the walls.", "You still doing the majority of housework and mental load?", "Hang it on the fridge. With a magnet. The way my parents did with my crappy forced art projects from elementary school.", "Hahaha absolutely forget that nonsense!!!", "He can go ahead and put that article clipping in his office at his office building where he works. Yours is where you work, his can be where he works.", "To me, this is the strongest argument his insecurity: why *now.* Honestly, dude, let your wife shine for a minute.", "Yeah I\u2019ve got the memo thanks", "I said four words, no need for all that", "Klm", "I'd agree with you but she made a point to say how ugly it looked and how unimportant it is \" it just a quote and a picture\" belittling something he has pride. Meanwhile I bet the husband has immense pride in his wife for getting her degree and wanted both near each other because they both mean something to him", "On the flip side, op's husband had 10 years to hang up the article if it really meant that much to him. He's only bringing it up now because op has something she's proud of and he can't handle having the spotlight on her for once.", "Yeah.... and she JUST got this law degree, and instead of being proud, he wants to hang up a 10 year old newspaper alongside of the law degree... Thats like if it was my birthday and you wanted to blow out the candles too because it was your dog's birthday 2 months ago. \n\nBeing proud of accomplishments goes both ways. Not just wife to husband.", "If he was proud, why would he insist on putting up his stupid, 10 year old article? \n\nAlso the fact you immediately jumped to \"ultra feminist take\" because I pointed out that being a stay at home parents is a valuable contribution is very telling.", "Tell him that his impressive achievement deserves to be memorialised publicly. Hang it in a place where visitors will see it. Make sure to comment on it when they arrive.", "I figured.\n\nI usually see /s at the end of sarcastic comments. Haha.", "Bingo.", "I love you. So nice to see someone with backbone on here", "He sure can. Just like you took care of the kids yourself. \n\nNTA. Congrats on that badass law degree!", "Of course. I'm tired as soon as I wake up.", "Did your art ever make it in the newspaper?", "Why the passive aggressive responses\u2026", "I am sorry, I guess i feel a little worked up for OP", "Or maybe she\u2019s tired of constantly supporting him, and putting her life on hold to further his career, and now she feels like he is trying to take her own accomplishments away. We have no idea what he is like. He could be super supportive, or he could belittle the fact she was a sahp. Either way, I think him asking to hang the newspaper clipping up next to her degree, in a place only she will see it, is rather tone deaf. If he wants to hang it up, then he should, but not in that room next to her degree. Hang it up where he and others besides her will see it, if it\u2019s so important to him. She should be able to have just one thing that is only hers.\n\nEdit: some grammar", "Possibly because op had already mentioned how cluttered the room was, things being hung on the wall means the clutter is subsiding and it's a good time to start decorating.", "I think your response is also very telling. You don't agree with my comment so took it out of context and immediately attacked me.", "So why are you still with someone that devalues you so much?", "Not my art, no. The quotes and pictures in the newspaper from 10 years ago are in a photo album where they belong. They were on the fridge for a month, one was framed and put on the wall in my bedroom, then I grew up and learned the world doesn't revolve around me, and that my achievements don't need to be displayed in every corner of my home.", "butthurt they got called out", "Cuz y\u2019all acting like I bullied this woman or something", "That could be it, but I am sure there is more than 1 wall in the office and ops husband can hang it up somewhere else.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting your own space to display your accomplishments. OP isnt insecure for wanting to have her own spot for her degree after years of taking care of her family. How many times have you gone into a doctors office and seen their spouse's news articles hung up next to their degrees?", "This part", "I said 4 words gahdamn, ur acting like a wrote a full paragraph like it\u2019s not that deep"]}
