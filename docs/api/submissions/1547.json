She chose to go NC and unless there are indications otherwise the only logical conclusion is it was voluntary.\n\n>Contacting an ex to find out about her condition seems very reasonable.\n\nNo, no it does not. OP has made it clear the ex is abusive and contacting them would open the door to them being in their lives again. It is not reasonable to expect to expose themselves to abuse/harassment on the off chance that their stepsister is in some sort of trouble without any evidence other than age disparity to indicate it.", "I mean a 40-something man with someone half his age would be a big clue in to the fact that he might not be the best of characters....", "This sub: don't punish your kids for misbehavior, they'll just keep misbehaving but now they'll be sneakier about it.\n\nAlso this sub: call the cops on your adult stepsister's perfectly legal relationship, that definitely won't drive her further into the creepy dude's arms!", "Being a legal adult doesn't mean she isn't in danger.\n\nHonestly... the fact so many of y'all would stand by when a vulnerable person is quite possibly being victimized is pathetic. \n\nBecause NO DECENT 40YR OLD MAN PERSUSES A BARELY-AN-ADULT 19YR OLD girl", "But do try to contact your step sis because she might seriously be in danger.", "Nice for you but you aren't everyone. \n\nAnd if she was already being groomed by her mother to placate men's needs, then I'm not convinced she would be able to extricate herself from a bad situation.", "Yeah....cause predatory men are known for being understanding \ud83d\ude44", "You\u2019re right, I meant it more as a make sure she\u2019s alive/safe.", "Nope... not the same at all.", "Absolutely. I would be worried about her well being. But people have the right to go where they want and with whomever they want. I just can't assume the guy is doing something bad to her with no proof. I hope she contacts her mom and everything works out well for all involved.", "NM, I misread the comment I was responding to.", ">  but is she in the US?\n\nYes, she's an adult in every state in the US. Most are 18, there are a couple that are 19. There's one where the age of majority is 21 *for the purposes of child support*, but that doesn't apply here. Contacting the police as you mentioned will do absolutely nothing, since adults are absolutely allowed to move out with older adults.\n\nOP can try to verify the sister is alive, but barring *actual* evidence of abuse or anything, OP should be careful not to do anything that could be considered harassment.", "I agree. Not a man I would approve of for my daughter", "What does this comment even mean??? That there are differing opinions on the internet that change constantly??", "Nobody disagrees with you however the law says they can be together if they want. I'm hugely against age gap relationships but if she wants to stay she's allowed to stay.", "Ok and if she chooses not to leave what then? I am not saying they shouldn't try but there is no recourse if she's there voluntarily", "Have you ever met a straight man?", ">\tHonestly\u2026 the fact so many of y\u2019all would stand by when a vulnerable person is quite possibly being victimized is pathetic.\n\nBut then they\u2019ll wring their hands and wail about the unfairness when she finally escapes after spending the next 10 years chained in his basement. \u201cHow could this have happened?! How could no one have done anything? A travesty!\u201d\nAnd then they\u2019ll set up a GoFundMe.", "She successfully extricate herself from her mom already.", "This girl blocked her family members and moved to another country. She doesn't want to be found.\n\nIf her family tries to get around that by going through a third party they would be very much in the wrong. It must have been really bad for her to do that in the first place.\n\nHer choices must be respected.", "...That has nothing to do with the conversation. Did you reply to the wrong comment?", "She\u2019s tried directly and been blocked so I doubt it", "And what can OP do, exactly, when all signs point out to the sister having gone willingly with the guy? She's a legal adult, she can live and sleep with whoever she wants. \n\nIs a 40 yo shaking up with a 19 yo sketchy and worrying? Yes. But when we call older men who go after barely legal girls predatory, we don't mean that's they're all kidnappers or serial killers or whatever. What we mean is a worrying majority of them use their superior life experience to manipulate the younger party into believing that their (crummy to abusive) relationship is just how relationships are, and/or true love.\n\nThere's nothing you can do about that until the person wants to end the relationship. In which case, the stepsister presumably still have OP's phone number.", "Also just because people want to help doesn\u2019t mean the recipient wants the help. You can\u2019t force them to accept help.", "Too many....", "Oof, well there\u2019s not much to be done then, we don\u2019t know why op can\u2019t talk to her ex; I\u2019m going to give op the benefit of the doubt that there\u2019s a good reason for the no contact. Seems like op has tried to help."]}
