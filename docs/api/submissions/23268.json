Alcohol was involved and admittedly I could have handled the situation with more finesse. \nOur interaction ruined wonderful evening.

It is literally exactly what it sounds like: when you invite an individual by name to your occasion, \"plus one\" (i.e. as well as the unnamed guest of their choosing). It is used to let individual guests who are NOT married or in long-term relationships know that they are welcome to bring a date to your event. Married people don't EVER get \"plus ones\".

You don't have to like your friend's spouse, but if you're inviting your friend, unless there is reason to believe that she will literally disrupt your wedding in some significant way, or be a danger to people there, you need to invite her. You don't need to talk to her beyond a polite hello if you happen to run across her that night, nor spend time with her, but you don't get to invite half of a married couple, because that invitation isn't a \"plus one\"...it's an invitation that should be addressed to them as the legally bound pair that they are. \n\nThere will be loads of Redditors who are going to argue that \"grownups should be able to do things apart from each other\". Irrelevant. This is literally an issue of long-standing, well-established cultural etiquette in the West (assuming of course that this is a Western wedding): married couples are invited as a unit, or not at all. Once people are married, in Western culture we treat them as a pair for official and formal social purposes. \n\nAs for the fact that they didn't invite you? Also irrelevant. I won't go so far as to say that social invitations aren't at all transactional, but they aren't entirely transactional. In fact, you acknowledge this yourself by the very fact that your friend clearly agreed not to invite you to their wedding, and yet you are willing and glad to invite him and only blame his wife. Interesting. But the point is, if you're hurt at not having been invited to theirs, don't invite either of them to yours. But inviting half of a married unit is not an appropriate option.\n\nAgain, Redditors in this sub are going to go off and insist that \"you can do whatever you want, it's your wedding\". Yup.

This friendship is done if she doesn\u2019t like you. \n\n**He took her back and you felt betrayed that he didn\u2019t listen to your advice about not taking her back**", "YTA. Yes, it's his WIFE. I wouldn't even bother inviting the friend as you will likely just stir up stuff in your friend's marriage and do more damage to your friendship with this guy.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t have to invite him either but decided to be petty and most likely caused issues between them. He will never choose you first so let this friendship go and say goodbye.", "YTA - if someone's spouse isn't welcome then you don't invite them either", "YTA. Grow up and invite them both or neither. Stop being so childish and churlish", "The friendship was already pretty damaged when she chose to disinvite OP. Made it pretty clear the friendship extends only so far as she's willing to tolerate it", "Yeah, I feel like if OP was actually over being disinvited to his friend's wedding, then it wouldn't be a huge deal to call him up ahead of time and say \"Look here's the deal.\" Instead, it's like OP is doing everything possible to make this invite as miserable as possible for his friend.  This seems like a passive aggressive way to demote a friendship while still trying to look like the good guy", "If she didn't want him at her wedding, she almost certainly doesn't wish to attend his wedding. I'd be shocked if this was even an issue", "You\u2019re right, OP can see her for all of zero seconds if he so chooses. He can avoid extended conversation with her.\n\nBy not inviting her. \n\nThe hill was set already, when he wasn\u2019t invited to their wedding. OP accepted it and moved on. Whether wedding invites have suddenly, retroactively become the hill to die on is not OP\u2019s decision.", "Except OP is a man who is about to marry a woman.", "It's not even the exact same thing. OP was not invited to his friend's wedding. Someone he has a direct relationship with. \n\nAnd now OP is not inviting the partner of said friend. A person who's not his friend, or he's even friendly with. \n\nThat's a huge difference, clear NTA", "Truth! \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d", "This would be\u2026 amazing \ud83d\ude02", "She didn't want her ex boyfriend at the wedding, that's understandable to me.", "> Turns out inviting people to celebrate your relationship while rejecting their relationship is, in fact, kind of rude.\u201d\n\nHmm so exactly what she did 4years ago. Why would OP invite the rude person that specifically excluded them?\n\n> The least AH way to handle such a scenario is to discuss it with the friend in advance to figure out the best option for both of you.\n\nHe can rsvp whether he wants to attend or not that\u2019s the options\n\nOP was not invited even tho one of the people getting married wanted them there, NO ONE in the wedding want her there why should she be invited?", "Where does OP say that they invited his partner but not him? Leaving a couple entirely off the invite list is \\*not\\* the same as deliberately excluding one half of a couple at an event about celebrating a relationship. Asking someone to come celebrate your relationship when you won't respect theirs is rude.\n\nSpeaking to the friend first is about not causing the friend more drama than necessary and thus helping to maintain the friendship, which OP seems to want to do. If OP sends a formal invitation \\*just\\* to his friend, with no warning and without his permission, there is basically no chance that the friend's wife won't turn it into Drama, and while OP may be spared because she won't be at the wedding, unleashing Drama on your friends when it's not necessary and easy to avoid doing so is also rude. It literally just takes him making a phone call or sending text or email, whatever way they prefer to communicate.", "My wife and I expect the mail to be opened except we told the other person specifically not to eg a special Amazon package is arriving etc. Else, the mail box will overflow. Maybe most people are just lazy like us and are happy someone opened the mailbox?", "Mild YTA.\n\nYou are under no obligation to invite her, and as you've said you're expecting him to say no and you're ok with that, so you're not acting entitled.\n\nHowever...\n\n>I have no intention of telling him ahead of time that most others are getting a plus one, but I\u2019m aware that he is most likely going to find out.\n\nThis is where I think you're in the wrong. Giving him a heads up rather than him finding out either on the day, or from somebody else makes it seem deceptive. I think a quick heads up to explain the situation would be best.\n\nAlso, do you really want him to find out on the day itself and potentially cause a scene? Or for him to look/act annoyed the whole day and ruin the vibe? Surely it's best to give him the full information up front and he can make an informed decision.", "Eh, I\u2019m going YTA.\n\nHere me out - you can invite who you like to your wedding, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re that close to the friend, let alone his wife, so inviting just him (a friend) and not inviting someone you dislike/barely know (his wife) is your free will. Plus, you weren\u2019t invited to his/her wedding, so neither should expect to be invited.\n\n**THAT SAID**, if literally everyone else is allowed spouses except a single, solitary person - yeah, that\u2019s a bit cruel, to your friend as much as his wife. He has to attend alone and hang out with everyone with their partners? Knowing his was barred and he\u2019s the only one alone? Just feels cruel.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s asshole behaviour, not because you **have** to invite **her**, but because you singled your friend out specifically.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t want his wife there, fine, but then just don\u2019t invite them at all. Inviting someone and then not inviting their spouse is a total AH move.", "YTA, I agree with your friends, either invite them both or don't invite them.  \nTalk to your friend and explain at least. This passive aggressive nonsense is not on.", "YTA\n\nI get why you don't want her there, but the etiquette is if someone is married the spouse is invited. In fact, unless you specifically SAY she isn't invited, they are likely to assume she is, and show up together.", "YTA  inviting the friend was the wrong move you just created unnecessary drama and put your friend in a bad spot. Terrible vibes.", "ESH. I wouldn't call any good friend's serious partner a \"plus one\". Partnered-up peeps kinda come as a pair in life to this sort of gig. You just specifically didn't invite her.\n\nIf you truly loved your friend, you would invite his partner, whoever they were. It actually feels good to be the bigger person and it's better for the soul.", "Because she went tramp mode and cheated on his friend and his friend then took her back.", "OP can go to his friend's second wedding after the wife invariably cheats and OPs friend divorces her.", "I don\u2019t know if it is even petty. It is understandable why OP would not what her there. It is not so much pettiness as bad etiquette. Still doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole.", "How? She refused to invite him to her wedding? Why is he obligated to invite her?", "This \u2b06\ufe0f.  It\u2019s explained very well.", "This is perfect. And yes to surrounding yourself with mature friends who can handle honesty!", "Or you just don\u2019t invite them, right? I don\u2019t understand inviting the friend at all.", "Shes salty becuase she wasnt invited ? but would she go ? If shes salty with the bride anyway? Its Petty revenge for not being invited", "It\u2019s important to keep the availability of friendship open when you feel the person may need support down the road, which is especially likely when there is previous cheating involved.", "I dated my friend\u2019s husband in college before they met. I was at their wedding.  They were at mine. All depends on the context.", "Dude, you \"dated in highschool\". You are not exes. It's not like you ever had real or serious relationship.\n\nAnd even if you did, you cannot \"have no hard feelings\" and \"still be friends\" and then snub them on your wedding.\n\nA normal adult invites all his friends, including his exes if they are still friends. Otherwise you aren't actually still friends.", "Eh it\u2019s hard when it\u2019s only a spouse keeping you from a friendship- i have a similar situation with a childhood friend. A group of us have know each other for over 20 years. We adore her, hate her husband to the point that he\u2019s not allowed at any of our houses. We don\u2019t see her much anymore because of that, which is fine, we expect her to pick her spouse, however, we don\u2019t feel like we need to completely drop her and stop the invited just so she know she\u2019s does have a support system incase she needs it.", "I open my guys stuff\u2026 when he tells me to. And he gets fun packages all the time \ud83d\ude05. I could see OP friends wife opening a beautiful invitation, tho. She sounds like an AH.", "Nine times out of ten, I will open hubby mail if I know his expecting it or has asked me too and he does the same for me. It depends on the couple, really.\n\nWhen it comes to wedding invites, it gets opened straight away and put on the fridge so we don't forget/lose it, so I would definitely notice a note in there.", "Eh unless it\u2019s from a bank or a parent we open each other\u2019s mail. One of my old roommates was a best friend and *we* opened each other\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too off base to worry she might.", "We dated for two years(15 to 17). And we were eachothers first.\n\nI'm friends with her husband but not with her. We play squash once a week and have a beer afterwards. When I do see her at his birthday for instance we are fine. But I can totally understand not wanting to have me at the wedding personally.", "Just wait a decade and the wedding invitations for those kids will cycle back around lmao", "Look, I don't know how old you are now and how long ago this all was for you. I also don't know the ins and outs of your relationship with this man. So I can't really judge what is or isn't expected here.\n\nI'm just giving you another point of view for you to consider:\n\nI'm 34. From my POV it is completely ridiculous to be jealous/upset with someone your partner dated when they were 15-17. Maybe you are 19 and think your past relationship was super serious. But it wasn't, dating in high school (even if you had sex) isn't a serious relationship. And no mature adult would treat it as such.\n\nIt is not a good reason to snub them from their friend's wedding if they would otherwise have been invited alongside the friend group.\n\nDo with this what you will."]}
