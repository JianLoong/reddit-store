Sobbing, screaming, shaking - will literally wet herself - by them just being within sight. She is in therapy for it.\n\nMy brothers girlfriend has a service dog for mental health reasons. We were informed of the dog, tried one interaction, we had the exact same situation (crying, wet herself, clung to her dad and would scream if he tried to put her down).\n\nMy mom told us that they were planning for her to spend Christmas with the family. I said that that would be fine as long as the dog stayed home. I did comment that he's only for mental health and she'll have my brother so she won't need the dog desperately. \n\nMy parents agreed and explained the conditions to my brother and his girlfriend who apparently broke down in tears. They think I'm alienating her, I disagree and think I'm protecting my daughters peace.\n\nMy brothers girlfriends argument is that her dog is fine and maybe him being friendly before upset her, so she won't let him greet anyone. I know from experience that that does not work with my daughter. \n\nI told my parents if the dog will be there we will not be. They have as such declared the dog and unwelcome guest. My brother is angry because this is his first Christmas with his girlfriend and we celebrate it every year with my parents - they should \"get\" this year.\n\nI don't think a girlfriend is more important than their grandchild and my parents agree.\n\nMy brothers words have been getting to me though and I do feel awful.

She's a girlfriend, as opposed to a granddaughter, who absolutely does take priority. Yes, this little girl does need therapy; this level of reaction to dogs is beyond reasonable fear. But she is entitled to visit her grandparents at Christmas without being terrified.", "I am the only one who thinks it's kind of ironic that someone who has a service dog for mental health issues is willing to bring the dog around a 9 year old kid that is in therapy after a traumatic event with a dog which then impacts the kids mental health?   If I was the girlfriend I would have said I won't attend I don't want to make things worse for the child.   \n\nIt sounds like the girlfriend said she would just hold the dog back and is making light of the impact it would have on the little girl.  I assume at least the uncle (brother) knows what happened to the child and could or would have filled the gf in about it.  I get OPs brother being upset because he wants his gf around but adults being ok with triggering a 9 year old on Christmas seems ridiculous to me.\n\nEdit for typo", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m going against the grain here, because so many people here are so determined the dog (and current girlfriend who might not be around next year) is more important to your family than your child, who is deathly afraid of dogs.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is you gave your parents, and brother, options. Obviously, your parents chose their grandchild over a dog for Christmas dinner.\n\nYour brother could have lunch or breakfast with your parents, but he\u2019s trying to push for the dinner for whatever reason.\n\nChristmas dinner is a family affair, not a \u201cparents, son, girlfriend, dog\u201d affair. He could have his girlfriend and her dog over earlier in the day and still come to dinner without his girlfriend (and dog) later. \n\nA dog does not come before a child, especially when the child is afraid of dogs, and the dog belongs to a person who may not be in all of your lives in 3 months, 6 months, a year.\n\nGood on your parents for choosing your child over a dog.\n\nYes, brothers girlfriend could also leave the dog at home for a couple of hours to have dinner, since she has your brother to support her, and you\u2019ve said she\u2019ll have hospital visits without the dog for days/weeks as well.\n\nNTA op. Keep sticking up for your child.", "NTA she's a child who literally wets herself at the sight of a dog, I can't imagine I'd be okay with that if I was the brother. I'd think 'oh wow yeah I don't want to do that to my neice'. How can brother and gf think 'oh but this little girl should be totally ok for our sakes' how can they not work around this? I don't care if I get downvoted, she's a traumatized little kid who should get to see her grandparents for Christmas, brother and gf can come at a different time with the dog or do something separately.", "NTA.  Y\u2019all gotta stfu and STOP asking \u201cbut why is she so scared\u201d because quite obviously something happened. And like it\u2019s for a girlfriend, not even a fianc\u00e9 or wife? Yeah no that\u2019s not that important like at all. I promise you. Not over the safety and well-being of a child. A child who, if you all cannot read, is literally in therapy to work on the issue. So maybe next year will be different. This year? Girlfriend and her dog can stay home and try again next year after some therapy if all works out.", "Why is the girlfriend\u2019s mental health more important than the daughter\u2019s.  They both have different and non-compatible mental health requirements.  Split the time with you parents accordingly.  NAH", "NTA. \n\nCommenters seem to ignore your daughters real mental health issues (PTSD due to dogs) in favour of the girl friends mental health issues. One can\u2019t just trump another but when a dog literally causes the issues, then the dog needs to stay home. It\u2019s up to your parents to decide what is more important and they did.", "NTA- these two individuals cannot coexist in the same space due to their individual mental health illnesses. The grandparents are aware of this and have been a decision as to who they will accommodate. The grandparents may not see the girlfriend in the same light as their NINE year old granddaughter and in all likelihood prefer to create lasting Christmas memories with their GRANDDAUGHTER over a POTENTIAL DIL. Hopefully, people understand that there is a hierarchy to life- and grandchildren usually come first to grandparents, even over their own kids!", "I feel like a lot of these Y T A are actually just coming from the subset of the population that can't understand that some people just might not like dogs. They're so obsessed with dogs they can't ever fathom that someone, not even a NINE YEAR OLD CHILD SUFFERING FROM DOG-RELATED TRAUMA, might not want to interact with their dog. 'She's nine, get over it!' The Gf is an adult! Why don't you say the same thing about her? Yes, it's for a valid mental health reason but did you READ what the poor child goes through when she's around dogs? And she's supposed to just deal with that, at her grandparents' place, for CHRISTMAS? To be clear, I don't think either of them should have to suck it up or deal with it, I just don't think they should be interacting atm because their issues are incompatible. And I doubt, if it's a mental health support dog, that locking it away in a garage is going to be any different for the GF than leaving it behind altogether. BUT I do think a lot of people have a blind spot when it comes to dogs and just see 'person doesn't like dog' and immediately think AH without the slightest bit of critical thinking.", "NTA.\n\nAll these people saying yta seem clueless and like they haven't actually read the post. The sheer number of commenters who say the child needs therapy when the post clearly states she's in therapy is ridiculous. \n\nThe child is in therapy. The child has PTSD from a relatively recent traumatic event. OP has chosen to not attend functions, family or otherwise, that involve the child's trigger, until or unless the ok is given by her therapist. All of that is fair. \n\nOP has stated in other comments that if they come across a dog in public, they just leave or walk away. \n\nOP's parents have set a no dog rule for Christmas dinner. It's their house so they get to set the rules. It's a private residence so no one can force them to accept a dog, service or otherwise. \n\nOP's brother was offered options but doesn't like them. He doesn't have to like them but those are the options given by his parents (the dinner hosts) and he needs to pick one.  \n\nOr he could be a grown up, accept that his young and traumatized niece can't handle a dog right now and go celebrate Christmas with his girlfriend's parents.", "NTA.  People seem more concerned about the dog than the people.  Definitely more concerned about hurting the feelings of a grown woman who is dating a family member than traumatizing a 9yo who is a family member.\n\nIf I were the girlfriend, I'd be like \"okay, we can visit another time.\"  Her reaction doesn't make sense to me.  Maybe she is planning to be a part of the family, but it's clear that she's not there yet.  \n\nThe grandparents are choosing to spend Christmas dinner with a child, a child-in-law, and a grandchild over a child, a child's girlfriend, and a child's girlfriend's dog.  Makes sense to me.\n\nWhy isn't the brother happy visiting at another time of day?  Seems reasonable to me.\n\nPeople seem to be worried about alienating the girlfriend (or maybe the dog), but has anyone considered how rejected a 9yo would feel if grandma and grandpa chose her uncle's girlfriend over her?  Or if her parents ignored her anxiety and forced her to be in the same space as the dog?  In another 10 years she'd be posting on r/EstrangedAdultChild .\n\nNTA.

Separate visits- brother and gf Christmas Eve of morning or night and op with kid just for dinner.", "I'm going with YTA only because instead of finding a compromise for your brother you literally made it impossible for him to attend with his love interest. Both your daughter and his girlfriend have need that are incompatible but getting the dog outright banned was unnecessary you could have the dog in a room while you're there or some other work around. As for the people saying it's only a girlfriend, isn't that how all couples start it? It's rather irrelevant the only thing that matters is they are a couple. She could just as much be his future wife as she could be his ex just like ops wife could be his ex in the future.all that matters is that he has a love interest that he wants to bring around the family so let him.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter has an intense trauma response to dogs. It's so significant that she is in therapy. You made an attempt to see if she could be around the service animal and it did not go well. \n\nYou are not saying or doing anything discriminatory against his girlfriend nor her need for a mental health service dog.  All you are doing is protecting your daughter. They are adults. Your daughter is a child with complex trauma, so significantly debilitating that she is in therapy for it. \n\nIn a perfect world, you wouldn't have to choose. Under these circumstances it fully agree that your daughter spending Christmas with HER FAMILY is more important that your brother bringing his new girlfriend.", "NTA - you have your reasons for not wanting to be there with the dog, for the sake of your daughter. Your brother and his GF have their reasons for needing the dog. You should both be able to have time on Christmas with your parents, so have separate events. One does brunch/lunch, one does dinner. Your daughter is in therapy so hopefully at some point she is able to be around them and you can share Christmas together again. BUT expecting your brother's GF to be able to handle an evening WITHOUT her dog is as unreasonable as expecting your daughter to go through that trauma being around the dog. The two situations are just incompatible at the moment.", "NTA you\u2019ve tried before by letting her meet the dog and it went horribly. The gf on the other hand has never tried an interaction with your family without the dog. It\u2019s a shitty situation, but the reality is that having the dog and your daughter in the same room is not an option at the moment. \n\nEveryone sucks a bit for not even trying to find a solution though. You could split the day or have different days. Like you take Christmas and they take New Years. Unfortunately this will be an ongoing conflict, and you do need to be open to not being at every family event because of this, and not have an attitude about it.", "INFO: is absolutely everyone unable to work with potential solutions instead of just \"no, absolutely not\"? For a group of adults, you're all horrible at constructively communicating. \n\n3hr meal hosted at the (grand)parents is no longer an option. It requires at least one of their kids being excluded. You and your bro can host now. Take a day each and swap next year.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother wants his GF to start becoming part of the family. I get that. And the GF does have a service dog (I am assuming you are right and it's not actually an ESA, which is totally different). If the GF is separated from the SD for an extended period of time, what symptoms does she have? Does she get hysterical and incontinent, or jut feel stressed?\n\nBUT ...\n\nYour daughter has an ***extreme*** phobia to dogs. Yes, she may be in therapy, but it can take years to overcome such a deep seated fear. If she is going to be literally hysterical the entire time she is around the dog, then you shouldn't even attempt to put them in the same place at the same time.\n\nYour brother and his GF are adults. Your daughter is not.

Everyone should adjust their thinking and planning accordingly.\n\nThis means:\n\n\\- You have to accept that SIL needs her dog.\n\n= SIL needs to accept that your daughter can't handle the dog this year. SIL needs to stop viewing this fact as a personal rejection.\n\n\\- Your brother needs to drop the idea that his and your SIL's preferences should take priority over everyone else's because it's their first Christmas together.\n\n\\- You need to stop trying to frame this as a question of who is more important. Everyone needs to stop, in fact.\n\n\\- Everyone needs to stop thinking of Christmas as a single event on a single day. 'Cause that can't happen this year.   Many families have multiple Christmases for all kind of reasons.  Your family should be one of them.\n\nLet your parents decide who they want to invite to their home and on which days.

Yes the GF could probably go 3 hours without the dog and have no major issues but on the other hand, you are expecting everyone else to change to accommodate your kid.  What do you do if you are out and about and there is a dog? Do you leave or do you demand that the dog owner go elsewhere? This situation sucks but you cannot expect the world to revolve around your kid and their behavours. At somepoint, your kid is going to have to learn to be in the world around dogs. One cannot avoid them forever. You either need to step up the therapy or get a different therapist who will actually help your kid progress in whatever trauma they have around dogs.", "YTA. Your comments are callous and show you don\u2019t feel bad in the slightest. I think a lot of commenters are thinking of her dog as an ESA, when in reality she has a service dog. Service dogs are highly trained and highly necessary. If she has a service dog, her mental health issues are much worse than you\u2019re letting on. Telling her her service dog can\u2019t come is just as good as telling her she can\u2019t come. At what point does she become family enough to truly be included? Will you compromise when they\u2019ve been dating for two years? When they\u2019re married? Well I\u2019d bet my bottom dollar it won\u2019t get that far without your brother reducing contact, although it doesn\u2019t seem like you really give a damn. \n\nShame on you for downplaying her disability and shame on your parents for alienating her and your brother from the Christmas celebration, all while trying to make yourselves look like the good guys.", "I\u2019m only voting YTA for your ableist comment about the service dog/ESA and the girlfriend: \u201che\u2019s only for mental health and she\u2019ll have my brother so she won\u2019t need the dog desperately\u201d like clearly not as she broke down in tears at the idea of not being able to bring her service dog/ESA with her. You\u2019re perfectly within your rights to put your daughter\u2019s needs before someone else\u2019s and it\u2019s important that you\u2019re standing up for her and her needs, but you need to understand that everyone else is also perfectly within their rights to put their needs before yours and your daughter\u2019s.

But that\u2019s not actually a reasonable request. \n\nIf you make your disregard for her mental health so apparent, you can\u2019t expect them to then care about your daughter\u2019s mental health.", "Yta. Not because you don't want the girlfriend there, not even because you don't want the dog there. It's your attitude of \"the service dog is only for blah\" you don't get a service dog on a whim. There are wait lists, specialized training you have to go thru before you get one, then the dogs can cost nearly 5k due to the training and certification process.\n\nI'm glad your kid is in therapy, having trauma/fear response like that really sucks.

Huge kettle calling the pot black vibes. Assuming the dog isn\u2019t one of those emotional support animals that have zero credentials, of course. A service animal is medical equipment, not something people can just leave at home. Like, it\u2019s fucking Christmas, can\u2019t y\u2019all both compromise so everybody can get what they want? Someone go in the morning and someone go in the afternoon, or is it a scheduling issue? The girlfriend is still a human being in the end regardless of \u201cjust being a girlfriend,\u201d show her some compassion, too.", "NTA. OP is looking into therapy for their child's fears, however, a miracle can't take place with less than two weeks to Christmas. It's a magical time of year,yes, but that kind of magic doesn't exist.\n\nHow is OP's daughter's fears less valid than brother's girlfriend's mental health? While her dog is an ESA, it's not actually a medically necessary being. Service dogs for medical conditions are one thing, but an ESA is literally not medically required. I can get an ESA form off the Internet for $10. It's much harder to obtain a service dog form for a dog who is untrained. ESA's don't require training.\n\nNow most people who need an ESA, don't always have their ESA with them. If it's for a 3 hour dinner, the brother's girlfriend can go a few hours without her dog. However, OP's daughter can't physically be around the dog for even a few minutes due to her fear.\n\nTherapy doesn't magically make the little girl's fears disappear in one session. It may take years before she can be around a dog. And I'm sorry, but a GF of less than a year is never more important than a grandchild/child.\n\nOP NTA.

In this instance, your minor child, who is a direct relative, has a phobia at this high level, and it\u2019s Christmas, wins. (If this were a wedding and a guest wanted to bring their service animal but the bride has an allergy to dogs, allergy wins because allergy and her wedding day.)\n\nAs someone trying to get a service animal, I completely understand the requirement for them, but this is a little girl with a real fear.", "Grandchild vs girlfriend is no contest.

And the gf needs to suck it up.", "going against all the comments ive seen and saying NAH. both your child and the girlfriend have mental health reactions to the dog, just on opposite ends. one cannot function so it the dog near, and one cannot function without it.  your daughter is too young to be able to regulate her emotions and rationalize her fear, and her symptoms seem too severe to start exposure therapy with dogs. the girlfriend is an adult, and while i absolutely emphasize with her (having an emotional support animal myself), presumably she has learned strategies to help her through things, even if dog isnt there. \n\nit is perfectly reasonable to not want ANY sort of dog near your child with an intense dog phobia. it is also perfectly reasonable to be offended when asked to leave medical equipment, like a service dog, at home for the sake of someone else. she (and your brother) are within their rights to stay away because the dog is banned, just like you're within your rights to stay at home if the dog comes. the decision about the dog (and therefore who chooses to stay home) is entirely up to your parents. I'm not going to say anything about the parents decision, because that's not the question being asked. \n\n\n(before anyone comments, yes i know that ESA's and service animals have very different qualifications. its not clear if OP knows that, though)", "Competing disability needs are so tough to navigate.\n\nI\u2019d be tempted to try to understand what the girlfriend needs the dog for and if she has any ideas how to make sure the dog and the child never see each other.  Because it\u2019s time to get creative.\n\nCan the dog stay in a bedroom/basement/garage while the brother and girlfriend finish up their visit, everybody hugs, and then extract the dog and go home? If the dog is helping with some issues where she can safely be separated from the dog for half an hour or so, maybe something could work.\n\nIf it\u2019s a seizure detecting dog or doing something else that she needs minute by minute support, then no, the girlfriend and the child are mutually exclusive, and the only way to handle it is to schedule separate visits. \n\nCan you leave early so your brother can have dessert with his parents? Does the child freak out seeing dogs on video calls, can the brother and girlfriend join in remotely? \n\nAs a side note - your dismissiveness about how the dog is \u201conly for mental health\u201d so it\u2019s not like she really needs it is pretty horrible, especially when you\u2019re able to be so protective about your daughter\u2019s mental health issue. Mental health service dogs can be extremely important, not just general companionship - PTSD dogs will clear/monitor areas for their person and allow them to safely move around in places and situations that otherwise would cause problems, they can figure out their person is getting triggered into a panic attack and get them to a calmer space before it gets too bad and do recovery support. Seizure and narcolepsy service dogs can detect an incident and warn their person to get to a safe situation, guard them while they\u2019re incapacitated, and get help if needed. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty gross that you\u2019re so casually dismissive of the girlfriend\u2019s disability aid.", "NTA.

It is their's as it is their house. If your brother wants to be mad he can be mad at your parents.

Without knowing the reasons the GF has this dog, or if it's a service animal vs. an emotional support animal, it's hard to make a judgement. Sit down with your brother and/or his girlfriend, obviously without your daughter, and talk it out. You mentioned in another comment that your daughter is being watched for PTSD. How do you know the GF doesn't also have it, and that's why she has the dog? Have a conversation, be understanding, and hopefully come to a compromise.

I think people are forgetting that a private home is not a public space, people can chose who they would like in their home. They can refuse to let people in for any/ no reason. The grandparents have chosen to have dinner with their own granddaughter over sons new girlfriend, which is completely understandable. \n\nMaybe one or both of their mental health issues will be better by the next year & they will both be able to attend, maybe son & gf won\u2019t even be dating anymore next year. It\u2019s grandparents house & it\u2019s their decision who is coming for dinner in their own home. They will obviously want to spend Christmas Dinner with the family member they are closest to which is their own granddaughter", "NTA. Not because of your daughter or the dog or anything like that, but because fundamentally it's not your decision. Your daughter can't be around dogs, and you made that clear to your parents.

They may or may not be AH based on that decision, but this post is about your decision, which was just drawing a boundary based on your daughter's needs.", "NTA.\n\nThe grandparents made their choice.

Of course you should prioritize and protect your child. You haven't done anything wrong by making it clear that the dog and your child can't be in the same place right now.

Your daughter shouldn\u2019t be traumatized at Christmas time because a grown adult needs her puppy.", "NTA dogs are NEVER as important as humans, and although service dogs can be helpful, there's always an alternative to their presence. A person's life does not quite literally depend on the dog. Frankly, I think they're becoming quite overused, as if there is no downside to treating a living being as medical equipment.", "NTA.\n\nI don't understand all the AH votes. \"9 is too old to be acting this way\". The child had a very traumatic experience with a dog. With that logic, veterans are too old to have trauma responses to gunshot sounds. That argument doesn't make any sense.\n\n\nAddressing the situation itself:\nIt's Christmas. Christmas tends to be about the young children (when there's children involved). Not to mention, Christmas matters to kids a lot more than it does to adults. Of course, Christmas is a holiday for everyone, but it's moreso focused on the kids. The daughter is 9, so she's a child, and probably still believes in Santa. This means that the holidays are probably extra special and exciting to her, so a nice family dinner is important. OP's brother and his GF are most likely adults, so they've already experienced all of their childhood Christmas \"magic\". As an adult, Christmas tends to be more of a nice season with a nice dinner where you can spend time with your family. The value of \"Christmas Day\" itself matters less. This is why I don't really understand why there would be any issue with the brother and his GF going for breakfast or lunch so that the CHILD can have Christmas dinner with her family.\n\n\nNot to mention, Christmas Day isn't the time or place to start exposure therapy on a child with RECENT trauma. So there isn't any compromise that allows the child and the brother's GF to both be present at Christmas dinner. The GF also hasn't even been around for a year yet, so there's no telling if they'll break up in the future or get more serious. Due to that, it makes no sense to exclude the kid from Christmas dinner to make room for a new girlfriend. If/when the relationship becomes more serious, the daughter will have been in therapy for a much longer time, so it would make more sense to make compromises then. Not now.\n\n\nI also don't see what makes the grandparents AHs either. Why should they choose their son's GF over their granddaughter? Yes, I understand that their son and his GF are most likely a package deal, but I don't think it's wrong for them to want to experience Christmas with their grandchild over their son who they have already spent every single Christmas with as he was growing up. OP didn't force their hand - either the dog (and therefore OP's brother and GF) don't come or they don't come, since the daughter should not have to go through exposure therapy during Christmas dinner. There is no room to compromise, especially if the GF can't function without the dog. The grandparents chose their granddaughter, which makes sense. It has to be an ultimatum because there's no compromise, other than one of the two parties showing up earlier in the day as opposed to Christmas dinner, and a child takes priority over an adult in that situation.", "NTA but may I suggest that your daughter become the service human for the girlfriend. Obviously, they both have trauma and need therapy.", "YTA. I wasn't against you in principle... Until you showed you have no idea what a service dog is for and decided the girlfriend's needs are invalid. No, you can't just deal with it. No, mental health needs aren't less emergent than physical health needs, especially for those who have service dogs. \n\nThere were compromises to be made.", "I\u2019m a parent as well and completely understand protecting your child. I saw some other comments about dividing the day which is a great solution in my opinion. The only issue I have is when you stated that she (gf) only needed the dog for mental health reasons and that she would have your brother. Now I don\u2019t know this girl from any other stranger but having said that, I don\u2019t know to what extent her mental health issues are. What I do know is that she is has, as you stated, a service animal for mental health. You, me or no one can say that she doesn\u2019t NEED her dog with her. From your account of things, even the thought of it having the dog with her causes her anxiety. So on one hand you have a daughter who is super afraid of dogs, and despite what others may say, that is an issue that she is currently working through, but as it stands, there\u2019s no immediate remedy other than keeping dogs away from her. Understandable. On the other hand, there is a girl who seems like she absolutely NEEDS her dog. Without her dog, SHE\u2019S crying, SHE\u2019s anxious. Now I\u2019m not saying to put your daughter in a situation that is going to trigger fear. But on that same token, you can\u2019t ask someone else to put themselves in a stressful situation for your own comfort. I still say that splitting the day is probably one of the better options.", "Info: How old is your brother?

It only got worse despite everything we did. \n\nSo we got a dog- it took close to 6 weeks of us carrying her around the place (kitchen bench to toilet- back to kitchen table\u2026). \n\nThen she stopped freaking out and he became her best friend- she is an adult now and LOVES dogs large and small. \n\nIt was a form of flooding, but highly effective. Fear of dogs is an absolute disability, but curable.", "NTA. Why should you care about a girlfriend who's fine being the cause of a little girl being so terrified and asking to come first in the family? Like, the selfishness WRT to a child is despicable.", "NTA\n\nI do not know the severity of the mental health problems that your brother\u2019s girlfriend has, but going off of the information that you\u2019ve given us, you\u2019re not the asshole.

This situation sucks on both sides, but if she isn\u2019t comfortable to go out without her dog for an evening with her boyfriend\u2019s family, should she even be dating?  She clearly has some stuff to figure out, but the fact that she couldn\u2019t understand and even cried over the fact that your daughter\u2019s needs go before her\u2019s in your family, shows that she has some maturing to do\u2026.", "This nonsense about the level and legitimacy of the dog\u2019s assistive role in their owner\u2019s life is not for me to judge. \n\nA compromise can be beneficial for both parties. If the girl friend can set the \u2018no greeting\u2019 boundaries then dad should talk to the daughter\u2019s therapist and make this moment a learning opportunity. \n\nThe dog can stay away from the child- the dog can be no contact and calm low key energy as they are trained to do. The daughter can be informed of the pet guest and have all of her coping strategies rehearsed prior. In addition, the family event will allow daughter to be in the same room but highly distracted (supported)  by family while the dog sits calmly apart. The daughter and gf can actually bond. They both struggle with their own anxiety and they can relate. This compromise could have a strong positive impact. \n\nIf the OP is still not willing to find a compromise he will responsible for creating a wedge between the brother and family. A wedge can never end well. \n\nOutcomes:\n1- If brother goes leaving the GF (who could be his wife on day) behind, his choice may bring about the end of the relationship. GF can interpret his choice as him not standing up for her, or not taking her need for the dog seriously. It sets a tone that says she is not accepted as is and she will never be comfortable around the family.  \n\n1.5 Brother will eventually resent his family especially if he has fallen for her.  Even I f they stay together in spite of this and eventually do start their own family, the Grandparents- uncle & cousins will have limited opportunity to develop relationships with family because wife will not attend family events w/dog and I doubt she\u2019ll spend holidays with out her children since she\u2019s not allowed w/dog. \n\n2- On the other hand, if brother stands by GF- it makes that relationship stronger (I got your back ) and the wedge is forced between brother & family because he chose her over them. \n\nA younger me would have accepted him to go and continued to try and make it work.

I would then tell my parents we will come for a visit either before or after dinner.

The GF is an adult, NOT part of the family, and her complete lack of sympathy for a literal 9 y/o shows that she is probably not going to become part of said family. You would think that someone who suffers from mental health would be more understanding.\n\nConsidering the dog was distracted from its job enough to approach the child/her family, I would say that this is a case of either an \"in-training\" SD, which doesn't have public rights yet by the way, OR it's an ESA that GF is calling a service dog. Either way, she will not die being away from the dog for a few hours, and OP was not belittling the issue by saying the dog was \"only\" for mental health problems. The grandparents made a good call, and I sincerely hope that OP's child doesn't come to resent her uncle for choosing his girlfriend's demands over her well-being.\n\n**TL;DR**- Gf is being unempatheric, and her dog probably isn't a real service dog and rather an ESA. PSD's and SD's are different and being away from one isn't life-threatening. BF should be able to help GF if she needs it considering how long they've been together. Grandparents made a good decision and OP is completely within their right to protect their child. Uncle/GF are TA's for invalidating and trying to exclude that side of the family for their own selfish reasons. GF's attitude probably won't get her into the family~", "Can the dog be held in a different part of the house? Or is it warm where you are - is there a backyard? I ask honestly because something like this is never mentioned  - it seems very all or nothing. Yes your daughters mental health is important; so is the girlfriend's.

I do think that your brother is being unreasonable, even if I do understand why he's upset.

Just look at this thread and the horribly misinformed positions some people are taking. Some of that is a result of people abusing the system (faking a service dog is also a misdemeanor, but it's hard to prove because of HIPAA). If enough people buy vests on Amazon and take their unruly dogs into grocery stores, it damages the validity and trust in people who actually have them and need them. My service dog does tasks my husband used to follow me around all day and do for me. It's genuine functional independence, the ability to get through my day, go to work, have a life without his constant support, go out with my friends.\n\nFake service dogs also threaten the ability for dogs like mine to work. My service dog costs as much as a new car. A nice one. And if a fake service dog that's untrained and unfriendly lunches at my dog and attacks, it could traumatize my dog and force an early retirement. And it takes about 2ish years or more to select and train a new service dog, so then I would be without my medical support for a few years. \n\nI have a blue handicap placard for what it's worth. It wasn't hard for me to get, but then again I really needed one and had a clear cut diagnosis that fit. No hoops for me to jump through. I see your point. It's discussed a lot. I see both sides of the argument but personally prefer some kind of official designation. It's easy for me to say though because I have the resources and support to do something like that if it existed. I would never want to do something that would limit the access for a portion of the service dog population.", "They should make the consequences for having a fake more severe honestly. Having a fake id card should result in a more serious consequence. Better education abt service animals. Things of that nature while it wouldn\u2019t nip it in the bud completely, it would make people take a moment to second guess themselves before gaming the system.", "I have a service dog for physical disability. For me, yes I can have a person help me instead of the dog\u2026but only for a short time if I can\u2019t have the dog with me. But it is a loss of hard fought independence to have to rely on a human (who are very unreliable truthfully). When I ask my dog for a task he happily rushes to do it and waits to get to do more. He doesn\u2019t say \u201cwhen I\u2019m done\u201d or \u201cnot again\u201d or \u201cwhy do you need that\u201d.  I don\u2019t feel like a burden when he is with me. Without him I could not go out alone and live an independent life. That is my case, but each case is different depending on the ability of the person and their needs. \n\nNow, for some dogs it is a life and death issue if they aren\u2019t there. Some dogs detect dangerous changes for diabetics or those with seizures and they give alerts that save lives. Some dogs see or hear for their handlers and make the world so much safer for them. Other dogs detect cardiac issues that can kill the handler. A dog for Autism provides many things also, from pressure therapy to calm issues, to saving a child\u2019s life by stopping them from running away. There are many medical conditions where to remove the dog places the handlers life at risk. \n\nFor a psychiatric service dog they are just as vital. The loss of the dog could trigger almost unmanageable issues with PTSD or other illnesses.  If someone\u2019s condition is severe enough that they need a psychiatric SD, removing that dog can be devestating. \n\nBottom line is Service Dogs do a huge variety of jobs for those with a disability. They are our lifeline and our way to be able to live as \u201cnormally\u201d as possible. Some people can go a few hours without the dog and some can\u2019t. And I really feel that the handler is the only one who can decide if they can function without the dog. To tell someone they will be fine without the dog is patronizing and insulting and very abelist. But we also have to understand as handlers that we won\u2019t always be able to take the dog into private homes. It isn\u2019t our home and not our say so it\u2019s then a choice of if we go without the dog or decline. I don\u2019t get mad at someone when they ask me not to bring the dog to their house for whatever reason. Sometimes I arrange something else so I can go and sometimes I politely decline or work on finding another way to meet up (my place, a restaurant, etc).", "Service dogs can generally sense the change in every rate/symptoms in way humans can\u2019t, even if they know each other really well. Parents with kids who have service dogs often wrestle with this question themselves, and wonder why they can\u2019t see when something is going wrong. Once they have the dog, they can usually become a more functional family unit because the parent\u2019s constant alert isn\u2019t healthy, and sometimes the dog has to go get the parent when something happens if they\u2019ve left the room for even a few minutes. The boyfriend here isn\u2019t equipped for that", "It's not really healthy for a significant other to play the role of psychiatric support and partner. My husband needs to be my husband. I can't ask him to follow me around all day doing the tasks my service dog does for me. It honestly causes a lot of strain, burnout, blurring of lines and healthy roles. Some couples have a partner as a caregiver and that's totally ok too. But it's probably easiest to see a service dog like a wheelchair. It's a medical device. You wouldn't ask the boyfriend to carry her around. In the case of a psychiatric service dog, they can interrupt panic attacks, notify their owners or rising heart rate with anxiety, catch anxious building behaviors and alert the owner to step aside prior to a panic attack, provide something called deep pressure therapy, fetch medicine and water, get help during an episode...it shouldn't be a boyfriend's full time job to monitor heart rate, scent, behaviors, and medical status of his girlfriend. Leave that to a very attentive service dog and let the BF play the role of the supportive partner. Hope this helps.

OP is the asshole.  Her daughter\u2019s mental issues are no more valid than her brother\u2019s girlfriends.", "What part of *mental* health are you not comprehending? The dog is not in use for medical reasons such as diabetes that someone else can help monitor. The dog is in use for mental health reasons. Whatever those mental health reasons are, they are significant enough to require a therapy animal. That's not a part-time kind of thing. People with that level of severity often don't go many places because of the fact that their therapy animal isn't welcome, and the need for the animal is greater than.the need to go.places where it can't go along. The child comes first, but the girlfriend's needs should not be minimized.", "Say you're an ableist without saying you're an ableist. \"Just mental health\" is why people don't get psychiatric care, because it's just mental health. As a person with Schizoaffective disorder, OCD, and ADHD I know that it's just as real as any other serious, chronic illness.", "Spoiler: even service dogs can\u2019t quite go everywhere. They are not allowed in churches if the churches don\u2019t want to allow them and they cannot go in private homes if the homeowners don\u2019t want them there. They also cannot go anywhere that would be dangerous for the dog.", "I agree that both the kid and the brother\u2019s girlfriend have mental health issues, and neither should be minimized or invalidated.\n\nI was mainly responding to comments above that were implying that the parents were coddling the nine-year-old, or that she was misbehaving. Children can have PTSD and/or phobias, too.", "Then brother needs to know now that if he proceeds, he\u2019s likely going to lose his family.  He certainly won\u2019t see as much of them because of course they pick grandchildren over his girlfriend.", "Actually it's important to have more than one coping mechanism. Just as some one might need to use wheel chair in some situation and crutches in others because the terrain is different or something like that. No matter what the coping mechanism is there will be situations where you can not use that mechanism for whatever reason. Because of that it is crucial to have more than one coping mechanism and that's what any mental health professionals would recommend. Relying too much on one coping mechanism can also create an unhealthy depency that actually provokes more anxiety and problems and narrows and restricts life.", "They were *having a meet and greet* with the dog as a trial. Of course the dog was being allowed to greet at a meet and greet.", "You replied to me in another thread and I'll say the same here. If the hospital is the only place the dog doesn't go it's because it's the only place that can provide the medical service she requires. That's what a hospital does. When you leave it, the service comes from the dog. If it were an ESA there would be a lot of places it isn't allowed to go, but OP said it's the only place the girlfriend feels COMFORTABLE without the dog. Not that it's not allowed when she goes.", "A service dog wouldn\u2019t interact with other people unless off duty or given permission. If the dog was too friendly the first interaction, that means toward it likely not being a service dog. The brother also didn\u2019t share any reasons why the dog would be needed and mostly just spoke about how upset she was in her reaction. If the dog was needed, he would\u2019ve defended her right to have the dog as well", "I already addressed psychiatric service dogs in a different reply. And tbh I think that\u2019s a little judgemental of crying as a reaction. I\u2019m someone who cries at everything - losing a board game, thinking about my dog, singing the bridge to a song, thinking about happy memories, etc. It wouldn\u2019t be out of the norm at all to cry at the feeling of being excluded and I know several people personally who are like me. The girlfriend\u2019s reaction of crying isn\u2019t a firm indicator of what the dog is for", "I recommend reading my replies as I\u2019ve responded to this point several times", "Not according to the ADA.", "We do though\u2026 the girlfriend acknowledges that she let the dog \u201cgreet\u201d and \u201cbe friendly\u201d towards OPs daughter which is not typical of working service dogs (not to mention incredibly stupid to do). Is this hard proof? No. But typically, people with a service animal do not have dogs that greet or are obviously friendly towards people. The service dog will typically lie quietly with their person (unless they\u2019re signaling) and if you didn\u2019t know the dog was there, you probably wouldn\u2019t even notice it.", "I understand what a service dog is lol.  How you speak so confidently on my personal knowledge without actually knowing me is something I\u2019ll never understand", "Service dogs are allowed in hospitals. ESAs aren't. Service dog might not be the correct term.", "At least the gr doesn\u2019t seem to understand as she proposed having the dog with the kid but without the dog being \u201cfriendly\u201d and greeting her. She doesn\u2019t seem to get that it\u2019s the very sight of the dog that upsets the kid, despite being told this (as far as I can understand from the post). She seems to refuse to believe the seriousness of the kid\u2019s mental issues, but gets upset that the family doesn\u2019t cater to all of hers. That bothers me greatly. Either she\u2019s entitled enough to think others are just faking, or she\u2019s completely unable to understand the total seriousness of a mental health issue that she isn\u2019t herself experiencing. Either way, the only solution is that the two families don\u2019t meet for the time being, until at least one of them has been cured of their mental health issues.", "oh, yeah, and from the way the OP is responding to being asked about the trauma involving dogs, it seems like they are both suffering in legitimate ways and are both seeking treatment. There are a lot of people here who need to stop looking at absolutes because this sucks for everyone involved, but especially the people with the needs that clash", "It really depends on the handler and the situation. My service dog loves to get loved on, and he especially loves kids. When his vest is on and he\u2019s working he\u2019s all business, but I can tell when he needs a break, especially on long days. If I have the time and energy, and if the person is polite, I\u2019ll sometimes let my SD greet people because it\u2019s does him as much good as it does them. A true SD shouldn\u2019t be allowed to wander on a super long leash and sniff people, jump, or get into things; but a controlled meet & greet doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a legitimate working dog.", "Grandparents would want their grandchild for Christmas. Especially if there aren't any more."]}
