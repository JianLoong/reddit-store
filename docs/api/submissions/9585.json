We can afford to send them the money, it wouldn\u2019t have an adverse effect on us. \n\nShe got extremely upset, saying that I am cutting down on her needs to help them. She asked why I\u2019m asking her to budget when I can send them the money. I did not want to budget to send them the money, I wanted to budget to save for the house.

How is that not telling her that the money you save on her trips isn't going directly to them?\n\nI'm starting to wonder if your parents have money issues above his retirement.   I question using savings for your education and taking out a loan for a wedding.  This doesn't say 'I know how to budget' to me.", "NTA\n\nYou don't \"need\" a trip. So that to me feels like manipulation.\n\nTwo trips in three months...that's a lot tbh and I don't know anyone who would expect to get two trips in a year who isn't fully retired and/or loaded.

I understand the frustration with the loan, but she needs to get a grip.", "Why isn't your sister paying back your parents for the loan they took out for her wedding?\n\nI feel you should be budgeting for your house  but not covering your parents debts.\n\nYour parents took a loan out for your sisters wedding, so she should pay them back.", "NTA. your parents are in financial trouble and they need the money. her needs are multiple trips and a house. your parents\u2019 needs could be greater depending on the severity of their trouble. $1000 isn\u2019t that much damage to your budget either. it\u2019s nothing major and can be made back soon. maybe you can cut your trip budgets down to compensate, but this $1000 won\u2019t affect you or your wife in the long term.", "INFO: Not to probe too much into your financials, but how significant is this $1k in relation to your wedding, your sister's, your other trips, etc.? \n\nRegardless, you and your wife need to have a serious conversation about money management and vacation expectations. Most people wouldn't be able logistically to go on two vacations within 3 months regardless of the financials. I'm genuinely curious how she thinks two trips can be justified in that short amount of time, but it depends on what a \"trip\" is - a drive to the nearest State Park for a weekend, or a week in Costa Rica?\n\nSeems like a whole lot going on here, and it's all a mess.", "NAH - I get why you want to help out your parents. I also get why your wife feels the way she does about your spending. You asked her to budget and she complied, but then turning around to give money away doesn't seem \"fair\".\n\nIt's kind of like my husband telling me we need to watch our spending and two days later a bunch of (unnecessary) computer parts shows up on the doorstep.

Sorry", ">She got extremely upset, saying that I am cutting down on her needs to help them.\n\nShe doesn't *need* two vacations in the span of 3 months. I can see why she'd be upset though, you've set yourself up for an argument by saying no to the second trip because you're saving for a house.\n\nIf you're saving for a house how can you afford to give your parents money?  This is likely what she's thinking and probably why she's upset.\n\nIf you sit her down and explain how much your parents have sacrificed for you and your education and how you deeply feel the need to reciprocate in an \"hour of need\", she might come around and see things differently. I hope so, anyway.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. A third and fourth vacation in a year is not a need in any way, shape or form. If you were literally unable to buy food if you had to give your parents money sure, but trips are a luxury, not a need that that's even a valid argument.\n\nI hate to say it but it sounds like she's becoming a bit spoilt.", "NAH, especially for wanting to help, but it\u2019s always a slippery slope with giving family money. Will this be a one-time financial assist or do your foresee sending them money regularly? If you foresee this being one-time, how will your parents spend differently in the future to avoid needing support?\n\nIt\u2019s always good to help if you can, but if this is going to be more regular you do need to make sure your wife is fully onboard.", "NAH, borderline E S H.  Wife's expectations of lavish celebration are in line with consistent past events.  I also very much understand her dislike of OP's parents, but it sounds like the money is a token amount to them that isn't breaking the bank or causing real hardship.  The spending cutbacks predated the gifting.\n\nAs for OP, I understand the desire to help his parents (in spite of their past actions).  It's a dangerous course to give the impression of picking them over your spouse, though.", "NTA. She still pissed off about the wedding. You\u2019re also not cutting down on her *needs* , those are wants!! Personally she sound selfish to me that she get past the wedding issue and she\u2019s clearly ok with letting them struggle because she *wants* two back to back expensive trips!! She\u2019s also not contributing to the household finances either at the moment, so technically it\u2019s your money. She seems to also care more about her expensive trips than being able to buy a house. Good luck with this one because you sound like you\u2019re going to need it with her!!", "Esh.   Your wife wanted to go on a vacation twice in 3 months and you said no because you wanted to save for  house.     Then you want to send 1k to your parents  which is admirable but how is that going to impact your future plans to buy a house?   I can see how she would find that hypocritical.", "NTA based only on the information we have here. Your parents financed not only your university education but also your post graduate education. Reading between the lines, it does not look as though they invested as much in your sister's education as they did in yours. It's also a pretty reasonable conclusion that your great financial success is a direct consequence of the graduate and post graduate courses that were paid for by your parents. If in fact they spent more on your education than they did on your sister's then it seems more than fair to me for them to finance her wedding but not yours. I admit that I'm not a great fan of simply totalling up all the money spent and counting fairness simply on the basis of the amount spent on each sibling but even in this case, it looks as though your parents were more than fair to both of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We can afford to send them the money, it wouldn\u2019t have an adverse effect on us.\n\nThis just strikes me as being petty and vindictive. It speaks more to your wife's desire to somehow punish your parents for not giving you even more money than they already have than out of any desire for justice. Your parents borrowed money to give you the best education possible so that you can create a good life for you and your wife and this is how she wants to repay them? Maybe she doesn't have the full picture. I'm trying to be generous here.", "YTA\n\nYour sister and/or herhusband can help as your parents did for their wedding.\n\nMaybe their (parents) have problems to give money away that the didn't have?! /S", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t like your parents because they did not contribute to your wedding, but they have contributed to your education which directly had an impact on the money you make today. Your wife only seems to care about how she can benefit from your shared finances, while contributing nothing herself. Sounds like she wants all the say in how your money is spent. 1000$ isn\u2019t going to put you in the hole, but it would greatly help out your parents. She sounds very selfish.", "ESH except you. Why isn't your wife working? Why were your parents happy to take out a loan for your sisters wedding but not yours?", "YTA. \n\nFirst, the edit helps because your wife is an equal partner, just not at the moment for a very legitimate reason. When you look at your life together, your wife will work and contribute, which to me, means that in this moment she isn't working, she still does get a mostly equal say in how you spend money. \n\nSecond, it sounds like you two in general need to get on the same page about how you spend versus how you save. She wants a lot of things, you want to save for bigger things, and you need to find a middle ground in general, not just in the moment. You two should - as much as possible- see money the same way in your relationship, regardless of who is working/not working. \n\nAnd third, if your parents hadn't taken out a loan to fund your sister's wedding, they wouldn't need your help now. Your wife is pissed, not because they didn't pay for your wedding, but they see you as a source of cash while going in to debt for your sister, and that debt is not for a thing that was needed. Yes they paid for your degrees, but they didn't do the basic work to get your wife to feel appreciated as a partner, but still see YOU as a person they can rely on for support. \n\nSo finally, I actually kind of do think you should send your parents the money, but you need to address how they treated your wedding- not your wife alone, but how they treated your relationship- and how they are getting their finances in order. That if they want to rely on you, that means they are actually relying on your wife too, and unfortunately, they never bothered with your wife to build that kind of relationship. \n\nAnd the only reason you are the AH here, as opposed to everyone or no one, is because you did curb spending to save for a house, but also say this money won't have an adverse impact. I get the difference, but you have to make a different case to your wife, because you told HER you needed to budget, but also that you have money for your parents, who have made it clear they don't care about her. The argument needs to be- I know I said we need to save, and we do, but I can't let my parents struggle, and that is why I need to send them this money. I will send them the money along with a conversation about our relationship and that this money is a sacrifice from BOTH of you.", "Lol NTA props on you as our parents took care of us (if they did) we should return the favor, it\u2019s your parents.. she living it well travelling and not doing much no work lol but it\u2019s okay to let your parents struggle??", "Lol NTA but mannnn you are in trouble.  \n\nGood luck in your future endeavors.", "Your wife is TA.  it's your parents, if her parents needed help I am pretty sure she would have no problem helping them.

If you\u2019re as financially secure as you sound $1K isn\u2019t going to cause hardship. This is a decision that both you and your wife have to make, but I can\u2019t think of a reason why you wouldn\u2019t help your parents.
