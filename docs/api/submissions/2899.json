He felt too small and I thought one move would crush him. Nobody in my family had babies growing up. I'm the youngest in my family and my siblings and cousins either haven't had kids or live very far away now. Other than my roommate none of my friends have kids so I have no experience at all. I've never been in a room with a baby longer than like 5 minutes before this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met my roommate in college and we became good friends and we both make decent money. So we rent a house together. She is a single mother and I'm more than okay doing anything that isn't related to caring for the baby. I don't dislike the baby I just don't feel comfortable. I've done late night store runs. She has her own clients and is somewhat self employed so there wasn't maternity leave for her. So for a while I took on all the bills, food, and baby stuff. She said she'd pay me back but I don't want her to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile she was pregnant and she'd talk about baby stuff she would be shocked that I literally know nothing. I can't even bring up examples because I don't know anything. She'd say something related to fake breast milk or something and I'd say \"what's that?\" When talking about it before the kid was born she'd get upset because I know nothing about children. I don't know what children do or what is healthy for a child or what is bad for a kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently the baby was crawling around the hall unattended. I casually walked over to her room and said he was crawling around and she ran out and the kid was already by the stairs like he was trying to die. She got upset with me for not picking him up or at least blocking him from walking toward the stairs. I just said he wasn't near the stairs when I saw him. She thought the kid was in her room. When I told this to other people they said I was being dumb but I just have no \"baby\" instincts. I didn't see the kid crawling in the vicinity of the stairs and think something bad would happen. My mind just doesn't jump to these things. Obviously now I would block the baby from walking to the stairs. She's my good friend so she isn't upset but she's shaken up.

But with that said, you better either understand that you are inadvertently taking on some responsibility for this child or move out. \n\nI am assuming you are relatively young and single.  Is this child going to change your lifestyle?  Can you no longer have people over for game night or drinks?  Do you have to tip toe around during naps?  Has she started asking you to babysit?  She will eventually want to start dating.

The roommate needs to take better care of watching her child. But, if you see the kid walking/crawling unattended again, pick it up, hand it to it's mother, snd walk away.", "I've read your recent comments. I'm not going to talk about finances, because you've cleared that up and it's a non-issue, especially since she's paying you back, and she has supported you during some rough times. My judgement stems solely on both of you taking care of a baby. \n\nRegardless of parental instinct or not, you should know that babies aren't invincible. If the baby fell down the stairs, would you have watched the baby tumble, then let her know the baby yeeted down the stairs? Or, would a common sense instinct arise, and you pick the baby up to stop it from falling?\n\nOn the other side of the argument, your roommate should have started to afford baby proofing equipment, such as gates, special handles for the drawers in the kitchen, making sure nothing was within the baby's line of sight, etc, etc.  Your roommate should also start paying for a babysitter in the times where she knows she cannot watch the baby. \n\nESH, but come on, dude. Next time, just pick up the baby, take them to their mom, and be done with the situation.", "Move out...this isn't the right environment for you", "NTA. It's not your kid. It's that simple.", "NTA, the baby is not your responsibility and the place should be more child proof if the baby is crawling!\n\nHOWEVER you two sound like you are really close friends and you obviously enjoy living with her, maybe (if you wanted to - not an obligation) you could do a little more reading or asking her to help you get more familiar with the baby?\n\nYou might feel more comfortable and i'm sure she would appreciate it to!", "Nta\n\nShe got mad at you for not doing her job as a parent.

Mom didn\u2019t know it was free roaming. No harm, no foul & it was an accident free lesson in how fast crawling babies are.", "NTA.  Why should you be watching her kid when she\u2019s around and not doing it herself?  I think you may want to consider that she is expecting you to be more responsible/involved in raising the child (even just as a second set of hands).  Have a serious talk with her explicitly outlining expectations as it seems like both of you are out of alignment.", "NTA.  You can not be called an AH for not knowing that.  Sounds like your place is not baby proof. That is on the mom to be aware of that and if she needed you to baby proof anything in the home she needs to let you know.\n\nThat being said if you want to continue living with your roommate and her child I would recommend that you take some time and educate yourself. I do not mean for you feel like you need to take on a roll in care for your roommate's child, but learning this information will only be help to you in a few ways.  The obvious is if you want kids in the future. Maybe you do not know if you want kids and knowing what it takes to care for a child will help you decide. Also I do not know if there are laws in which you could be held responsible for if something happen to the child and you were around in the home when the child had an accident.\n\nCaring for a baby takes way more than natural instinct and society starts training/teaching females earlier way more than males to take care of children early in age.  Think about, most females are encourage to go babysit if it is not their first job.  While male have and can babysit too but sadly been questioned about it far more.", "Why don\u2019t you guys have a baby gate on the stairs? Why doesn\u2019t she put one on her door?\n\nUltimately, she\u2019s the one who wasn\u2019t watching her kid. That\u2019s on her. \n\nBut yeah, if you see a loose kid or a kid about to have an accident or get hurt, you should intervene when you\u2019re the only adult in the room. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have a bunch of experience with children to use some common sense when it comes to safety. Maybe consider taking a babysitting class? Even if you never plan to babysit, you\u2019re living with a child.

I'm guessing that there is other baby proofing that also needs to be done.", "NTA.   Now that the baby is crawling you can pick him up,  he/she won't break, babies are pretty resilient and you should at least learn what to look out for like stairs,  hot stove, and such just so the baby is safe going forward.", "ESH - You\u2019re the asshole for putting your uncomfortableness over the baby\u2019s safety. And she\u2019s the asshole for not watching him more carefully.", "ESH.  You for walking away from the baby when he could have tumbled down the stairs and your roommate for failing to babyproof the apartment.  There is more to babyproofing than a few gates, the entire place needs to be safe for the kid.  That means locking cabinets, a lock on the toilet set, doorknob covers so he can't open a door when he's standing and walking, etc.  It's on the mom to take care of that and on both of you to consistently use the locks, etc.", "YTA if you saw a little penguin heading for the stairs wouldn't you stop it?

No. But risking a child being seriously injured because you didn't want to help is a true asshole move.All you had to do was pick the kid up and move it.", "ESH but her far more than you. It sounds like she is treating you like the kids dad.

It's your roommate's baby, so it's on her to supervise and baby-proof the house. You are not responsible for babysitting or childcare.\n\nOn the other hand, it doesn't take any childcare experience to see an unattended crawling baby (or a drunk adult, a small puppy, or a rolling glass vase) near a staircase and recognize imminent danger. \n\n\"My mind just doesn't work that way\" is the kind of thing people say when they don't want to learn basic life skills. You're 25 years old and have been sharing a house with a woman and baby for months now. If you still know so little about babies that you'd actively leave one in obvious danger, it's because you're choosing not to learn anything from the experience you're living in.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
