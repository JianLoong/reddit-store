It is a reason to end it.", "NTA. It's a no-win scenario but kindness and love to ending an animal's suffering is not wrong. It is a family member and deserves comfort and rest. There is no teleporting back to a time when our pets are young and healthy again. It is hard to let go and say goodbye, but when a pet has no quality of life, it is time. More than time. \n\nWith this being your son's dog, it is probably more that she feels a piece of her child was alive in the animal and now there is one less living link to her son. And that is hard, and requires more grief counseling and support groups. Your wife also needs kindness, but you were 100% right to not let that poor pup suffer further.", "NTA.

I don't think your wife would have ever been ready to let go of that poor dog. She has been told for half a year that animal is suffering, it's time to put him down. She was hanging on to the dog as means of hanging on to your son. I understand, I really do. But there comes a time when forcing your dog to continue is cruel. Part of the deal we make is they love us unconditionally, they pick us up when we are down, those furry butts do so much for their human. In return, we give them their best life. We feed, bathe, love, cuddle them. Sadly, at the end, we help them cross the rainbow bridge, as painlessly, with as much love as possible. Your wife forgot that part. \n\nNAH.

I cannot fault you for your decision, but I cannot fault your wife for her anger, as she obviously hasn't been processing her grief well - but she really needs some mental health help.

My family won't take her to the vet and whenever I bring up putting her down my mother tells me that she doesn't want to talk about it.

Animals go to great lengths to conceal illness and pain out of instinct. (In the wild, weak animals are targets.) Pets often will go off by themselves, stop eating, or otherwise isolating themselves as a way to prepare to die and to keep predators away from their pack/family group/home, etc. My cat had been doing all of those things for weeks. By the time we are asking ourselves whether it's time, it is usually past time.\n\nI know she wanted a chance to say goodbye, but it was not in the dog's best interest to keep it alive and your son, who loved the dog, would surely not have wanted it to suffer this way.", "NTA. Hopefully she will see what you did for her. Thank you for being the responsible one.", "NTA.

I recently had a conversation with my wife while we were contemplating putting down one of our pets, a rat but the theory holds true. You should, where possible, never put down a pet on its worst day, because that is how you will remember them. Instead, let them go out on a high note. You don't want to make them suffer, so it is important to let go when the time comes. That is where your wife went wrong. As for you, making the unilateral decision is unconscionable and unforgiveable. Your wife should have been able to say a proper goodbye, but you stole that from her. Now, every time she thinks of that dog she will think of how she never got to say goodbye and how it was because of you. It is a conversation you should have with your wife. I could understand making an appointment and letting your wife know, but doing it completely without her? No.", "\"The vet has been pushing for six months now to let that poor bastard die.\"\n\nThis makes me feel better, vets do not want to kill animals they can fix.   \n\n\nBut not letting her say goodbye is a forever thing.

I'm not usually one to play armchair reddit psychologist, but there's no question that the loss of your son made it much harder for her to let go of his dog. And that... honestly, I can't blame her for that. I can't even imagine what it would be like to lose a child. And then to have to face putting down that child's beloved pet? A last connection to the baby your lost? God, I don't blame her at all for struggling.\n\nOf course, that doesn't make you wrong. The dog was damaging her health and risking the safety of your other children. It was in pain and suffering, and deserved relief. You were right to put the dog down.\n\nHowever, and I want to be clear that I say this with absolutely no judgement of you whatsoever - you still deceived her. Yes, you were right to do it. Yes, it was necessary. But unfortunately, because she was unable to make the right decision herself, you were put into a position where you had to deceive her in order to do the right thing. And that means she really was deprived of a chance to say goodbye. No matter how good your reasons, the betrayal and broken trust she feels right now is still very real.\n\nShe needs grief counseling to help her deal with her grief in a healthy way. And you will both need help to repair this breach of trust. With help, in time, she really *will* come to understand why you did this, and that she was doing harm to your family and to the dog, and that your hand was forced. But, right now, all she can see is that you lied to her - because you did. And it's really not going to be easy for her to understand that you were probably right to do it. \n\nAnd also.... *you* lost your son, too, and then had to lose his dog. Your wife isn't the only one grieving, I'm certain of it. Very, *very* few people are capable of handling that kind of grief in a truly healthy way - sounds like you're healthier than your wife, but that doesn't mean you have to bear this alone; it certainly doesn't mean that you have to bear your own grief *and* your wife's, which is kinda what you're doing right now. You deserve to have someone to talk to who can help you with this weight, too.", "NTA - it was the right thing to do, and very selfless of you. I know that dog is thanking you.", "NTA I get where your wife is coming from seeing as the dog was all that\u2019s left of your son but she needs to realise that she couldn\u2019t continue to treat the dog that way. You did the right thing getting it done without her because it would have never been done otherwise. The only question I have though is did you stay with him till the end?", "ESH because I think telling her before you did it would have emotionally prepared her more. There was clearly some grief/trauma from your son tangled up in this.\n\nWere you able to cremate or get any memorial items like a lock of fur? Maybe you can have something nice made from them, or if not get a new item for her that\u2019s symbolic of the dog. There are tons of companies that do this.\n\nAlso see if you can encourage her to seek short-term therapy. Grief doesn\u2019t really have a time limit, and sometimes a new aspect emerges that needs to be examined.", "NTA \n\nYou have an absolute obligation to care for your pet\u2019s well-being, and that includes ending their suffering when it is necessary to do so. Your wife, **unintentionally**, was being selfish and unloving towards the dog - you were being unselfish and loving. \n\nThat said, I suggest you get to couple\u2019s therapy immediately to have a third party help you two work through and accept that fact together. Grief is illogical and can be overwhelming. The dog on its own would be tough to come to terms with; considering the dog\u2019s connection to your son, I think it is unlikely that time alone is enough to heal this wound for her. \n\nYou absolutely did the right thing for your dog, and you should feel good about that. But now you also need to do the right thing for your wife.", "NTA. When I was a child, my mom held on to a dog like this and it was awful. The dog was blind, acted confused all the time, couldn\u2019t eat anything other than baby food, and had chronic diarrhea all over the house. My mom held on to her [the dog] until my dad finally sat her down and was like \u201cThis needs to end. This is cruel and not fair to anyone in this house.\u201d I went with him and she was humanely euthanized. \n\nMy mom was VERY attached to this dog because my dad got it for her after she suffered an ectopic pregnancy on top of multiple miscarriages.

When we take on animals, we take on the burden of making sure they live a comfortable life - even if that means taking away their suffering.\n\nI moved an hour and a half away from my parents for college and my childhood cat stayed with them, I was a broke college student and he had diabetes - logically I couldn't take care of him like my parents could, and he was bonded to my parents cat. I wasn't going to break her heart either. \n\nI slept in one Saturday after a grueling round of midterms, and when I woke up I had tons of missed calls from my parents, so I panicked and rang them until someone answered. \n\nMy cat had suffered a seizure and was sluggish and hardly moving, so they went to the vet who recommended he be put down. The missed calls were them trying to get me to drive up to say goodbye. \n\nI was heartbroken he was gone and I couldn't say goodbye, but my dad shamed me for MONTHS that I didn't answer my phone or come up to say goodbye, until one day I had enough and told him that I was happy they put him down without me there - I didn't want him to suffer any longer than he had to, even the hour and a half drive it would've taken me to get there. My dad finally understood and never mentioned it to me again. \n\nGrief is crazy, but your wife is taking it to an extreme. She was being utterly selfish and causing that poor baby pain in return.

Now, I did agree that the dog had been diagnosed with hip dysplasia and was in pain.  But the trauma of coming home to my husband telling me and the kids that he had the dog put down without any notice or the chance to say goodbye was traumatizing, me and both of my sons still have the feeling that what he did was cruel - not to the dog - but to us.  \n\nWhen you have two pre-teen boys, laying on your bed, screaming because they wanted to say goodbye, your heart dies a million times.  And then it dies a million more for your own pain.  What hurt most of all was the vet offered to stay late until I got home from work so I could be there with the kids.  Husband refused that offer.\n\nWhen I had to put my service dog down, believe me, it was torture.  And it was in the height of covid.  But I was able to lay down next her, put my hand on her heart and whisper in her ear how much I loved her and adored her and thanked her for helping me learn to walk again after my accident and that she was the bestest girl ever.  She slipped away, hearing me tell her I loved her.  And as much as it tore me apart, I can't even comprehend not being there with her.  \n\nI lived what you did, and I believe what you did was cruel to your wife.

Some genuinely don't know how to define a good or bad day.\n\nThere are quality of life scorecards out there that are super helpful for all pet owners. It feels cold and uncaring sometimes to use a scorecard, but it really helps to determine how many bad days they're having, what defines a bad day, and helps people emotionally prepare.
