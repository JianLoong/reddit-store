It's us, our four kids (ages 10y-13mos), and our kids' nanny. The last few years we've invited my brother Max 30M who is single and my mom. We spend most of the day with the kids but bringing the nanny means we can split them up and they get more 1:1 time with each adults, and it means we can also do adults-only/older kids-only activities as preferred and late night drinks after the kids are in bed. In theory we're treating my mom/Max but in practice they usually kick in about 15% each in the form of paying the tab on a big dinner or treating to an activity.\n\nMy mom is well-off and passed that onto us, but my other brother, Jake 45M is not good with money and has had money issues in the past. My mom offered to pay his and his family's share of the entire trip as well as their flights/activities because she wanted him to come and wanted us to bond more. They have 3 kids (9yo-5yo). However their kids changes the dynamic because we're a much bigger group (5 adults+4 kids vs 7 adults+7 kids), it makes everything more of an ordeal. I love my kids but this is my vacation as well. They're also making it harder on their kids by forcing them to stay up later or do the boring thing with us, so I don't blame the kids for not being as well-behaved. My mom who loves her grandkids but isn't really a kid person if we're being honest offered to pay for a babysitter after night one but his wife was offended so she backed off. You would think they would trade off instead, like she stays home with the kids he comes out for drinks with us but apparently that's not on the table. We've ended up just breaking off from the group more than we normally would, but Max normally sticks with us if it's us vs. Jake's family, then it becomes something where my mom has to choose between us and she hates that. Last night was the final straw because they kept their kids up way too late and one of them had a Meltdown and then later when they got back they woke up our kids due to another bedtime meltdown from a diff kid. I said to him that I know our mom was paying for literally everything on this trip, the least he could do was get a babysitter. He got really pissed and said I was a bad father, but I'm not the one dragging my kids to things they don't want to do on their vacation.", "created_utc": 1680540447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12aq4ar/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_get_a_babysitter/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What a clusterfuck.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t just about money, this is about time, energy, and everyone feeling like they had a nice trip. \n\nThe last few years you\u2019ve invited your mom; it\u2019s nice that she\u2019s coming as your *guest.* That doesn\u2019t mean she now has the right to invite your brother\u2019s entire family. Regardless of who\u2019s paying, adding more adults and more kids makes for a totally different kind of trip. \n\nTell your mom that this is *your* family\u2019s vacation, that you get to decide how your vacation is spent, and you don\u2019t want to spend it worrying about babysitting your brother\u2019s kids.

As for tantum and schedules. To each it\u2019s own. This is something that come out all the time I go in vacation with other families. Nanny or not nanny.

But then she is also entitle of her WHOLE day/s off. \nBut even if, with such a huge range of age it is inevitable to become a problem one day or the other.", "I guess I'm going to be the weirdo who says that I don't think anybody's necessarily being an AH here: I feel like what's happening is just a breakdown of communication and a lack of understanding. Your brother sounds like he and his wife are trying to keep up with you guys and don't know how your system works and because of it the kids are ending up staying out a lot later than usual and their schedules are all thrown off. They probably turned down the babysitter because they feel like your mom has already spent so much money on all of this so that they could come out and enjoy it and don't want to push it any further. You guys probably have a certain system in place and things that you like to do and ways that you like to do it, it sounds like this is a well-established trip for you. But this trip, this one in particular, involves a group of people who have never been traveling together trying to figure it out. I think the best thing to do is just sit down and try to have a civil conversation. Put the kids to bed, sit down at the dining room table or something, and just hash out what the plan for the rest of the week is. It sounds like tension is just high across the board and a lack of communication (or communicating while stressed and upset) is only going to make it worse. You have people who are parents stressed about kids who are in a crazy new situation that is stressing them out, and then you have people who want everything to be exactly as it has been every other time even though just adding one person to a mix can completely change the dynamic of a situation. \nI will say that some of the comments regarding money and the financial aspect of it does sound like you carry a little bit of a 'better than you' vibe, which is probably being picked up on and isn't helping your brother or his family feel like they can effectively communicate without worry of being spoken down to. I may be wrong, of course, but the best way to find out really is to sit down and more effectively plan the week out FOR everyone WITH everyone in mind. I hope the rest of the trip goes well and that everyone can find some peace and have some fun.", "YTA. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect that a vacation with 2 families, 7 kids, and 5 adults will be as simple as one with a single family and a nanny. First, decide if you\u2019re really ok with your brother going along or if you\u2019d rather he came for part of the week or not at all. If he comes along, plans need to be made and details hashed out before vacation- lay out what you want to do with/without kids and ask your brother (& wife?) the same. Plan activities for the large group and to do separately.", "ESH\n\nyou needed to communicate the plan with jake before you started the trip.", "YTA - if this had all be discussed and communicated ahead of time about the expectations it would be different. Take out who is paying for what at this point as youre all there - you cant hold that over people\u2019s heads to tell them what to do. \n\nYou just have different ideas and strategies about how to vacation with kids and tbh, yours sounds a little judgmental.\n\nYou agreed to a trip with certain people with however payment worked and now youre upset because the children you knew were going to be on the trip, were children.", "ESH. If you mother wants to invite your brother on an all-expenses paid vacation, she can plan her own. Family or not, it seems awfully presumptive of her to invite people to join in on YOUR vacation when she herself was invited.\n\nBUT, once the list of holiday-makers/attendees had been established, the adults involved in this endeavour should have laid out the ground rules/expectations so everyone understood what was going to happen.", "NTA your spending time with your kids during the day and enjoying you our evenings. There is nothing wrong with that. If he doesn\u2019t like how you vacation then they should start taking thier own.", "NAH\n\nI don't think that this vacation sounds particularly well *planned* (on any of your parts) given that you clearly don't get along particularly well, but I am not seeing where you are the AH or your brother is the AH, just that you have different parenting styles. You have a nanny and your vacationing style is to use said nanny to do things without your kids always underfoot. Fair enough. Your brother's style is to vacation *with his kids*. ALSO fair.\n\nSome of your comments and responses are a little too judgey mc judgerson, I have to say. Kids are going to get worked up after a fun day in the sun and after having sugar. It's part of having kids and changing the routine. If you were unprepared for this, there should not have been 7 adults and 7 kids staying in the same vacation rental.\n\nMost families don't have the luxury of a nanny that vacations with them. Kids go on vacation and spend the entire time with their parents, which includes restaurants, museums, outings, and everything else. Your brother's \"method\" of vacationing that you're complaining about as *so unreasonable and how dare he bring his kids with him instead of hiring a babysitter so they won't be around annoying me* is really a lot more typical for the vast majority of families out there. Food for thought.\n\nSo I would try to chill out a bit and in the future if doing this vacation all together is important to your mother, see if you can plan more activities separately, or look perhaps for two small cottages that are close by each other but not the same house so that families can have space.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We said this to them. They said okay and then brought all of their kids which meant we couldn't stay as long.

Of course I don\u2019t see why your nanny should be responsible for them. \nBut still a Full day work is 8 hours. Unless you are ready to pay premium extra time and bonuses and a proposition for sainthood.\nSo is the day the activities or the night out. I am one that travel with nanny but I know it\u2019s a huge expense and or is the day or is the night. You can\u2019t expect someone to get a nanny for the day activities and a nanny for the evening out. I alwasy have nanny during the days usually, cause like you I have a baby that still naps and older one that do not. I am totally fine taking turns with my husband. I enjoy my night without him also. \nAlso his kids are 5/9 so no naps and one random night late won\u2019t kill them (unless you go out clubbing until 2 am)", "I get that you do not like your brother's parenting, but honestly a lot of your posts read like you would prefer if his kids simply weren't included at all in some of the activities. It's fine if your parenting style is to get a nanny and have her supervise your kids so that you can have adult only time or can take only the oldest child to a museum, but I'm sure you're probably aware that for the vast majority of households, a nanny isn't within their budget for vacations, so adults take their kids with them to museums, and they take their kids with them to dinner. So when I'm reading you type, *my brother brought his children out to dinner* or getting the vapors over taking them to a museum like it's the kidnapping of the Lindberg baby, I'm kind of rolling my eyes a little.", "That's my point: OP is treating the vacation like he normally would, which means there's designated times and places for adult stuff and older kids stuff which the younger kids end up in a different place for. But his brother either isn't aware of this or isn't understanding this and what they're in the process of doing, so the kids are constantly being brought into stressful situations where it doesn't really make sense for them to be. I'm saying that if they sit down and just communicate openly about what the plan for the rest of the week is, then his brother will understand when and where it's okay to bring the kids and when it wouldn't be a good idea. Where OP might want to have time away from the kids and do adult things, his brother might not want to or might not feel like it's appropriate given that he doesn't want to extend his mom any further with also having to pay for a babysitter. And he might not have the money to pay for one himself, let alone be in a position to find someone to do so even if he does have the money since they're on vacation in a place he's unfamiliar with. If everything is planned out ahead of time then instead of saying 'hey, we're going to dinner', and it turns out to be like a more adult themed restaurant that the kids are now stuck in, they'll know that this particular dinner is something which the kids might not want to go to. So his brother can either opt to figure something out for the kids, or to not go and do something else instead. It seems like across the board that they're just starting to split up in general and have separate vacations anyway, but this way they can at least figure out what is possible for them to do together as a family and maybe kind of salvage this a little bit and relieve some of the stress that everyone is feeling so that it becomes a better vacation for everyone.", "Well not everybody can afford childcare. And some families like to do things in vacation together. Also cause here they ask for nanny during the day to do adult things, nanny evening for night out. This nanny is then the one that complain on subreddit Nannie\u2019s about working 20 hours a day for 30$.\n The thing is big groups is IMPOSSIBLE to make everybody 100% happy and unless someone is very easy going are a recipe for disaster.", "Yep, exactly how I feel after reading OP's reply. \n\nExpectations, a set list of \"here's what I/my kiddos aren't going to do, y'all figure out your group during this slot of time\", etc. would've saved a lot of headache here.

She was your guest then invited another family on your trip.", "NTA", "Nta. Don't invite them next time. Or make them get a different place to stay", "But now you know for future planning.

You're all dancing along the asshole line though.\n\nI think Jake and his wife should be taking more responsibility for their kids. If it's getting late, they should be more concerned with getting their kids to bed than trying to keep up with you. If Jake's kids are getting rowdy in a museum but others plan to stay a while longer, Jake and/or his wife should leave with Jake's kids and make a plan to meet back up a little later.\n\nI think you should have realized that adding Jake's family to the trip was going to change the trip. You should have communicated with Jake and planned with him how the vacation would go. It sounds like you just expected Jake's family to fall in line with your vacation norms. When you invite another family, it isn't just *your* family's vacation anymore.\n\nI think your mom needs to accept your family's relationship with Jake's family. Sure it would be great if you could all be one big happy family, but that doesn't sound likely to happen here. Your mom hates choosing between you, but this was her idea. She should have realized that there would be times when such a large group breaks up to pursue different activities. She should be looking out for everyone's happiness, not trying to force her ideals into reality.\n\nI am also wondering where your wife is in all of this.
