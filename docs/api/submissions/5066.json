As a result of his crime, we lost our home and the lifestyle we'd been living (rightly so, as it was funded by not-our-money). It caused behavioral issues among my siblings (now 28M and 25F); my mother (59F) sunk into  depression for a few years (she knew nothing of the con job, as she was a SAHM and my father handled all finances); and eventually my parents divorced, though remained amicable. Through my mother's hard work and determination, we were finally able to get out of the the poverty created by our situation and live a somewhat comfortable, though modest, life. My father died a few years ago.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I volunteered at an leadership event where we were working with teenagers who came from disadvantageous backgrounds. Many were poor, had a parent incarcerated, family members who were drug users, etc. These were kids who showed a lot of educational and leadership potential and were looking to break free from the cycles that kept their families in poverty.\n\nI was partnered with a 16F whose father was incarcerated, and I was having trouble connecting with her. She insinuated that I was privileged and knew nothing of her struggles, and brushed off my attempts to work with her. I then disclosed my background to her, and she realized we'd been though a lot of similar situations. The dynamic then changed, and we had much more positive and fruitful interactions the remainder of the weekend.\n\nWhen I told my mom about this, she was livid that I discussed \"a private family matter\" and that she was embarrassed others knew what we went through. She said it was not my place to discuss with others. I said it was as much a part of my story as hers and I had every right  to tell it as I see fit, given my father is dead and it no longer affects him. My sister thinks I'm also an asshole, and my brother is indifferent. So AITA?\n\nTL;DR - My father was jailed for embezzling $10M and I told the story to someone I'd just met in order to connect with her. My mother and sister are angry at me for sharing \"a private family matter,\" even though it's just as much party of my story.", "created_utc": 1671388507, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp4zbg/aita_for_disclosing_my_fathers_incarceration_to/", "score": 249, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you did a great job.", "NTA - \"Don't know how you heal a wound and not let it get some air.\" - Barbara Neely.  You shared your experience in order to positively impact someone. You did not use the story to profit or elevate yourself. Yes, your lived experience is your story too.\n\nYour family sounds ashamed. You were victims of his actions. Living in poverty was not a choice. Family stories can focus on success which includes the struggle.

Its not like you wear a tshirt with 'My gather embezzled $10M and went to prison' on it. You shared a story to help connect with someone who needed help.

Part of people connecting is realizing that despite perceived socioeconomic backgrounds we all have a lot in common.  \n\nYour mom, rightly so, probably still has a lot of embarrassment.

You shared to connect and maybe your whole story, like how your mom just got on with it, will help these kids when they feel life is impossible.  \n\nI have family friends in the same situation as your family so from a close outside I saw the shame and struggle.  Yes it\u2019s a family matter, but that also means you get to tell it.  I\u2019m sorry your mom is still struggling with it.\n\nMaybe your mom needs to hear that she\u2019s the hero.  Because she really is.  And her story and yours is worth telling.  You don\u2019t need to be rich to understand Dad is an asshole, made us homeless, mom saved the day, here\u2019s what she did for me look at me now.  \n\nTHAT is very much a story worth telling especially when it seems all is hopeless.", "NTA - that\u2019s *your* story.

This isn\u2019t a family secret, a Google search would probably pull it up. \n \nAdd to that - your mother is highly unlikely to run into the kid you were talking to. It\u2019s not like you told the ladies who lunch down at the country club. \n \nYour mother needs to get a grip. I get it if she doesn\u2019t want to tell people herself, that\u2019s her choice.\n \nBut talking about *your life?* That\u2019s your choice.", "NTA.  Your father's crime, conviction, and imprisonment is public information, not a family secret.  It is your story and you can share it however you like.", "NTA. It is not a secret.

I'm not a fan when some people think it shouldn't apply to other people. Telling other adults that you're related to that they shouldn't tell truthful things is out of line.", "NTA. But why you brought this up to your mom and family is beyond comprehension. It was a conversation between you and the young girl you were trying to forge a connection with.
