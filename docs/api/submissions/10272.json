Anyways this all happened about a week ago and on this night I was babysitting for my sister but this night she said no TV because my nephew already had a lot of screen time that day but after a few hours of playing bored games and hide and go seek I decided to put on a movie anyway but only after about 5 minutes into the movie my sister told me to turn it off through a camera I didn't know she had so did and once her and her bf got home from work they tried telling me that I acted unprofessional and irresponsible and told me that they would be cutting my pay for the night in half and that they thought it was fair and that I should be happy I'm getting paid for the night at all so I asked for a ride home and told I'd rather not babysit for them anymore.

That is appalling.\n\nIf your sister wants to curb her children's screen time that comes off her time with the kids, not the underpaid babysitter she is abusing.\n\nYou sound responsible and trustworthy. Stop watching your sisters kids, figure out what the going pay is for sitters in your area, take a CPR/First Aid Class and watch peoples kids who won't treat you like an indentured servant.\n\nAlso, YOU decide your pay.", "NTA.  Your sister is really going to bust out the \"unprofessional\" card?  On a 15 year old that she is paying peanuts to?  And she is spying on you without your knowledge?  \n\nOkay.  Let's go professional. Make her sign a contract.  Hourly rate is 15/kid/hour.  Payable in cash up front.  \n\nYou have all the power here, if you choose to see it.  No one can make you babysit if you don't want to.  She will act like you should do a bunch of stuff, and give you all sorts of reasons, but in reality she wants less for you and more for her, no matter how she sugar coats it.", "NTA. You are being taken advantage of. Let them find someone else who is prepared to put up with their nonsense.", "Using a camera to spy on you was not cool. NTA", "NTA.  Using a spy camera is creepy.  Running out of things to do can happen.  You did the best you could think of.  Cutting your minuscule pay in half was mean.  I agree with not babysitting for them.  After hiring a few horrible babysitters, they\u2019ll see how they messed up.", "NTA - if they want a professional babysitter they should pay you a fair wage. At $20 for hours at a time they should be happy to come to a child that is still alive. If you refuse to babysit and they have to pay someone they will come around.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to work for someone who doesn\u2019t pay a fair rate or cuts your pay without warning.", "NTA. Your sister underpays you, leaves a minor alone for long periods with a young child, imposes conditions that make your job harder for no extra reward and monitors you without warning. $5 a hour if leaving you for 4 hours doesn't seem worth the aggro. Think she killed her golden goose. Expect if stick to not babysitting for a while, much better rates might be on offer.", "Nta. \n\nFamily are not free daycare.  \n\nIf you choose to have a kid and can't watch that kid all day. You have to pay for help. If you can't afford that.  Then you shouldn't have the kid. That's how life works.  \n\nAlso. It's illegal to video someone without their permission, even if its on your property. Them filming you through the camera and you not knowing about it is illegal.  \n\nI'd now demand more for her stupid and illegal  actions.", "NTA\n\nYou get to decide how much you want to be paid, and she is trying to con you. Don\u2019t ever babysit for her again, and I would recommend keeping your distance. She didn\u2019t even tell you that there was a camera there.", "NTA\n\nYour sister and her BF have been taking advantage of you.  Don't babysit for them again.  \n\nAnd if any other family members complain to them, offer to tell Sis that those family members would be happy to help her out.", "NTA\n\nYou set your rate of pay. Nobody else can do that.", "You're NTA, tell them to pay you at least minimum wage after that.\n\nI would refuse after they had been watching me and talked to me through a camera rather than respectfully contacting me by message or call. Fuck that.", "NTA, first of course do not babysit for your sister again. Also i kinda feel like she should have told you there is a camera in their home. Who wants to be filmed/watched thru a camera without being aware of it?", "NTA. I guess they should look into finding a new babysitter. $10 or even $20 is absolutely taking advantage of you. Limiting your time to watch TV based on his screen time that day is rather controlling. I think you should speak to your parents or just find some way to be unavailable.", "NTA. I hated screentime for my son, but I did use YouTube videos to teach him alphabet and phonics when he was still in diapers. I never taught him how to read, he did it all by himself. He's 9yo now reading 9th grade reading level books. So maybe that can be an idea for you when babysitting other kids, not your nephew since you sister clearly underpaid and disrespected you.", "$20 an hour or 20 for the entire night?", "NTA. You were there for at least a few hours and honestly $20 is way too low a payment for that. I can't wait to hear what happens when they learn they can't find anyone else willing to work below minimum wage to care for their child.", "NTA You should stop babysitting anyways. This is full of red flags: \n\n1) You\u2019re not getting paid. $20 a night is exploitative.\n\n2) Secret cameras are always a red flag. The fact that they spy on you without your knowledge is super creepy.\n\n3) Retroactively cutting your pay in half is a power move and it\u2019s about showing you that they control you.\n\nAny one of these things would be enough for me to never go back\u2014but all three??? Run and never look back. You should babysit for other families. Don\u2019t accept anything below minimum wage.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nSpying on you while you work is bad enough, but when you compound it with refusing to pay what she agreed to pay you is intolerable.", "NTA- the fact that they\u2019re paying you makes it a job, and you\u2019re free to reject any job if you don\u2019t like the terms. This is a perfect opportunity to renegotiate and clarify your arrangement if they want to keep using your services in the future. I\u2019d start with an hourly rate and a clear list of what activities are and aren\u2019t allowed.", "When people pay substandard rates, they get substandard service.  \n\n$20 for a whole night?  Please.  In 2023, it's almost not even worth getting out of bed for.  I was making that in the early 90's (30 years ago) for 3 hours of after school babysitting.\n\nI think it's ridiculous that they dictated no screen time and expect you to occupy and amuse your nephew for all that time for so little money.  I would have put on a movie too.  \n\nAnd it's unethical and deceptive to have a camera without informing you of it.\n\nIt really irks me when adults take advantage of youth.  And that's exactly what your sister and BIL were doing even BEFORE they stated that they would cut your pay in half.\n\nIf you were my son, I would tell you to stick to your guns and demand at least $15 an hour if they want you to provide active childcare.  If they refuse, you're old enough to find a better paying job.  Do that.  Let them find someone else who is willing to work for almost nothing.  And do not spend one second feeling guilty.\n\nYou're NTA.  For all the reasons above and this:\n\nThink of your future.  In order to build a successful future, you need to earn money and learn how to manage and invest it.  The teen years are THE time for you to be saving and investing like a beast.  Only a couple of thousand invested at 15 years old literally becomes your retirement savings.  But you need to make real money to do that.  When adults deprive children of the opportunity to earn realistic money and deprive them of financial literacy, they deprive them of secure financial futures.  It's one of the greatest disservices to young people.", "NTA I know the rates are higher because I live in large high cost of living city, but I used to make $35/hr nannying. Go find a better gig that will pay your hourly at a fair wage. I never work with family because often they feel entitled to your time at a discounted rate and if you stand up for yourself drama ensues. Best to not mix business and family.", "NTA  \n\nIf their boss  decided not to pay them for hours worked they would be upset.    \n\n\ninfo: Did they give 3m what they thought was too much screen time then expect you to be better than they are  at caring for him?     \n\n\nI wonder if they were just before payday broke and too embarrassed to admit it?\n \nI would let her off from the ten dollars because finding and paying for a 24 hour day care is going to be expensive.       \n secret surveillance is not cool.         \n   \nIf someone begs you to do it so they do not have to- they should  pay you in cash in advance in case your sister lets you down.", "NTA. You should be paid a lot more than $20", "NTA\n\nIs it legal where you live to record people without their permission? Because not telling you about the camera is rude and I would refuse to babysit again purely for that, let alone how they're massively underpaying you.", "I mean, it\u2019s not a professional situation? Where I am $20 is how much you pay a babysitter **per hour**. Why on earth they think they should be getting a college educated nanny level of child care for less than the cost of two people going out for dinner these days is beyond me. \n\nThey\u2019re really going to regret this when they find out they\u2019ll get the same level of care you were able to provide but need to pay $20 per hour instead of per day.", "NTA - depending on how your parents act and your sister protests, it might be wise to get a job to take up hours so you are unavailable to babysit.  Sounds like nephew is going to be the big loser, but that's on your sister not you.", "NTA\n\nIf they tell you explicitely not to watch tv, then don't watch tv. It's not that difficult, so that's a small mistake on your part. But they went way overboard with their reaction and it's just disgusting that people use cameras to spy on other people. Good call on not wanting to babysit for them anymore.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nFrom now on you just say \"I would prefer not to babysit. Please find another babysitter.\"\n\nThey will tell you you HAVE to, it's your DUTY, it's family, you're letting everyone down, everyone will be so angry!\n\nAll you have to say is \"I can appreciate that.\" That's it. That's all you have to say. \n\nThey'll yell. They'll cry. They'll call you names. They'll beg. Plead. Offer you more money (and not pay it later, it's a tactic. Get EVERYTHING IN WRITING. record all deals on video.) All you have to do is say \"I can appreciate that.\" And then stay silent. \n\nYou hold ALL THE POWER. They need you, and you do not need them.", "NTA!! Usually people get paid 20 an hour for babysitting so I would just stop all together.. maybe get yourself a part time and make money that way.. do not let them or your parents force you to take care of her kids. She is grown and can afford her own babysitter", "NTA. Don\u2019t babysit for them anymore unless they pay you $20/hour", "Nta. Op, your sister will most likely not find anyone to babysit for such a low rate- it\u2019s therefore big of her to act like you are the one at wrong. Do not babysit\u2026 and say that of you do so you will be fixing an hourly rate. \nAlso\u2026 my relatives do the whole watch through camera thing and it\u2019s. Not cool\u2026", "ESH. You should not have put the movie on as it was against the wishes of the parents. Unfortunetly, with babysitting no matter how stupid the rule is you have to follow it. that being said, a \"dont do it again\" would have been enough, and you are totally within your right to not want to sit for them. if they throw a fit, ask them if they would be ok with getting half their paycheck for the day because of one mistake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
