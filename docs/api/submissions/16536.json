Now some of this definitely had to do with undiagnosed thyroid/endocrine issues, and some of it was related to the psych meds I was on throughout my childhood and adolescence. But a lot of it also had to do with the diet available to me and the attitudes about food I was surrounded by. To give my parents their due, they did try. They were constantly trying to get me to exercise and eat less. They tried to provide what they perceived as a healthy diet. But the shame I felt for being so fat, the overwhelming despair when I would do everything \"right\" and still not lose, or even gain weight, was horrible. I'm in my late 20s now and doing better, but it's been such an incredibly long, hard road to get here. I'm down a little over 80lbs right now, and I'm on track to be down a full 100 by my birthday in early July. I had to completely relearn my relationship with food, physical activity, and health in general. I do an insane amount of research on food choices and diet and health. \nAll of this to say if these things had been more important to my parents (if they had better led by example) or had they been better educated in nutrition and overall health then perhaps I would have had an easier time with it myself. It is vital that children learn, and be shown, what a healthy lifestyle looks like early on, and be well educated on both. Your concerns are very valid, and approaching your sister about it was a good idea. No child should ever be made to feel shame or guilt for their weight, or for what they have been taught. But ideally the adults responsible for them will help them to learn and develop healthy habits early on, and in this your sister is failing your niece.\n\nETA: you were NTA in voicing your concerns to your sister, but now that they've been voiced don't push. Pushing will never work in situations like this. Instead try talking about health as it relates to yourself. Talk about the foods you eat and what they do for your body.

I didn\u2019t mean to criticize, and I\u2019m sorry for bringing it up like that.\u201d \n\nUltimately this is the truth. And what you think you needed growing up may not be what this child needs.

I know because I have been overweight for most of my life and have only in recent years hit a healthy size. I've learned a lot in the process, which often makes me feel like an \"expert\" and prone to giving unsolicited advice.

I'm still morbidly obese, but I've lost a little over 80lbs and I feel so, so good. BMI is definitely a very very flawed measure for sure though. A little overweight isn't really an issue, and most people's weight will fluctuate some throughout our lives, so you're absolutely right there!", "I promise I have researched nutrition, fat, and exercise more than you, your problem is you\u2019re starting with a conclusion (that fat isn\u2019t bad) and then you search for evidence to fit your conclusion rather than looking for the real answer, because you\u2019re using this thought process as a coping mechanism, every human uses coping mechanisms, its what our brain does to protect us, but become aware of it", "Objectively they are right. If you are significantly overweight you are not as healthy as you can be, and it will cause long term problems even if it's not causing them right now. Not only do studies consistently continue to back this up, but I can also speak from a place of personal experience. It's not healthy.", "The comment you're responding to here didn't mention BMI they said being overweight. When people say overweight they don't mean by the BMI definition, that's not really how people think. If they meant that then they'd be saying that anybody who carries even a bit of excess muscle mass is overweight. They mean carrying excess fat which is almost always bad at least in the long run. BMI is utter bullshit so you're right about that but you're also intentionally misunderstanding people", "I would recommend looking up the history of that term then, and what scientific basis it was developed on before you equate obesity with health. \n\nIt's ultimately up to you though, and there's nothing I can do to change your mind.", "Of course they do, but FAT as society defines it, has very little to do with those health outcomes.", "Ah, of course it is the individuals' fault, then it's easier to just blame the individual rather than the economic and social nature that surround the individual and are absolved of guilt!\n\nGreat plan. /s", "there is literally nothing in the OP that indicates she was doing that.\n\nif she was trying to shame the daughter, **she would have talked to the daughter**. \n\nthat's a huge and unjustified leap to make.", "Good, CICO has affected healthcare systems globally; how the concept of fat leads to malpractice in the Western world at least. I'm happy to provide sources if you're genuinely interested.\n\nThat is where my conviction comes from.", "...Yeah, your information is 90 years old and we've progressed from there. Perhaps read newer research on the topic?", "I'm glad you're happy with your progress, it's so awesome you're feeling good \ud83d\ude0a", "Do I think fat is good? Or perhaps I think it is a neutral term.\n\nYes. In fact if we want to start my psychoanalysis (as you have done), perhaps I don't want people equating \"bad/wrong' with something that is a neutral concept. If I were to psychoanalyze you (since that is what we are doing), I would say your assumption that I think of fat as a positive trait says more about you than it does me.", "Want to know where the term overweight and obese came from and their shared history? And the history and inherent bias in medical systems towards fat people?\n\nI'm not saying that fat is bad or good, I am saying trying to judge someone's \"health\" by their weight is fatphobic and hurts the people you may be trying to help. Especially when that's between them and their Doctor.", "How can it possibly be anyone else\u2019s fault but the individual? Or the parents who failed them? Yeah the economy sucks. Yeah society is mean. That doesn\u2019t stop anyone from making positive changes for themselves. You should better yourself for YOU, not the approval of society. \n\nAnd guess what? People will still be mean if you lose weight. People don\u2019t stop being mean because you get smaller.", "There is.  She mentions that the kid gained weight first and foremost and then goes onto talk about food with a side note of wheezing.  She didn't ask about asthma or environmental conditions she went straight to assuming weight caused the wheezing.", "I think she was trying to shame her sister's parenting", "I have access to peer reviewed research sources thanks. But as I said, it's not something I believe in. However my original point still stands. I don't care what shape I am, or what shape anyone else is, but  stating that being overweight and eating poorly is detrimental to health is not fat shaming.", "Got any sources on some credible research that points to the contrary?", "You know what yeah, tell me about the interconnectedness of those terms. But again you say judging someone by their weight, I do not judge someone by their weight I judge them by the appearance of excess fat tissue, which is a useful heuristic. Altho in order to engage in this in good faith I should probably disclose that I am in fact fatphobic. I do not fat shame but the views I hold could accurately be described as fatphobic. If that changes your willingness to engage I understand", "Girls gain weight.  It usually precedes a growth spurt and puberty (around 8 or 9).", "you're acting like expressing concern for her niece is the same as a concrete diagnosis. why does OP have to be 100% sure about the source of the wheezing? she sees cause for concern and is concerned. if the niece had a healthy diet and asthma, her sister could've just said \"yeah she just has asthma\" and it would've been over.\n\neven if OP was wrong, which she definitely could've been, I don't know why it matters because **she very clearly was not shaming anyone**.", "Are you acting fucking dense on purpose? She said that her weight is what made her unhealthy lifestyle 'noticable', OP was more concerned when the niece couldn't even run a minute without wheezing. Do you really think it is completely normal for a 7 year old CHILD to start wheezing after running for a minute? OP hasn't even stated any underlying conditions that the niece had that could've caused her to react this way", "that's a bit more reasonable but still a leap I don't understand or agree with", "As \"a fat\" who has been fatshamed for existing, may I please request that you avoid fat people and mind your own business regarding _anyone's_ body. \n\nThank you.", "Yes, I am a proponent of fat liberation, and we are opposed if you think fat is bad and actually judge someone's health or circumstances because of it.\n\nThank you for understanding my perspective evem if we disagree."]}
