I was out playing with my niece and she couldnt run even 1min without wheezing.\n\nSo I decided to advise my sister on being exposing her daughter to a healthier life, not saying she mustn\u2019t have her favourite treats but a balance.

Now some of this definitely had to do with undiagnosed thyroid/endocrine issues, and some of it was related to the psych meds I was on throughout my childhood and adolescence. But a lot of it also had to do with the diet available to me and the attitudes about food I was surrounded by. To give my parents their due, they did try. They were constantly trying to get me to exercise and eat less. They tried to provide what they perceived as a healthy diet. But the shame I felt for being so fat, the overwhelming despair when I would do everything \"right\" and still not lose, or even gain weight, was horrible. I'm in my late 20s now and doing better, but it's been such an incredibly long, hard road to get here. I'm down a little over 80lbs right now, and I'm on track to be down a full 100 by my birthday in early July. I had to completely relearn my relationship with food, physical activity, and health in general. I do an insane amount of research on food choices and diet and health. \nAll of this to say if these things had been more important to my parents (if they had better led by example) or had they been better educated in nutrition and overall health then perhaps I would have had an easier time with it myself. It is vital that children learn, and be shown, what a healthy lifestyle looks like early on, and be well educated on both. Your concerns are very valid, and approaching your sister about it was a good idea. No child should ever be made to feel shame or guilt for their weight, or for what they have been taught. But ideally the adults responsible for them will help them to learn and develop healthy habits early on, and in this your sister is failing your niece.\n\nETA: you were NTA in voicing your concerns to your sister, but now that they've been voiced don't push. Pushing will never work in situations like this. Instead try talking about health as it relates to yourself. Talk about the foods you eat and what they do for your body.

I asked my mom why my legs were bigger, and her response?

And as others have mentioned, children SHOULD be gaining weight, because they\u2019re growing. Their body size will fluctuate as they go through growth cycles.

In any case, when someone you love is reactive (especially around things that are sensitive like weight) and you don\u2019t know why, the first step is to apologize. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be insensitive! If this is a no-go topic for you I\u2019m happy to never mention it again.\u201d People just need to know that you will respect their boundaries.

I didn\u2019t mean to criticize, and I\u2019m sorry for bringing it up like that.\u201d \n\nUltimately this is the truth. And what you think you needed growing up may not be what this child needs. If your concern is fitness, approach that and ask about or engage in activities with her yourself. Children who discover healthy activities they enjoy are much more likely to be fit as adults then those who are overly focused on food. \n\nAnd btw, a growing child *should* be many pounds heavier as they grow.

I would comment only on the lifestyle, suggesting that things like the wheezing have the potential to improve.

Most people don't think about their diet giving them inflammation or cancer until it's too late. For many, \"I'm concerned about your lifestyle\" = \"You're letting yourself be fat.\"\n\nMy parents talked about vegetables in the context of different nutrients, and talked about junk food as something we had the privilege to avoid.
