Now some of this definitely had to do with undiagnosed thyroid/endocrine issues, and some of it was related to the psych meds I was on throughout my childhood and adolescence. But a lot of it also had to do with the diet available to me and the attitudes about food I was surrounded by. To give my parents their due, they did try. They were constantly trying to get me to exercise and eat less. They tried to provide what they perceived as a healthy diet. But the shame I felt for being so fat, the overwhelming despair when I would do everything \"right\" and still not lose, or even gain weight, was horrible. I'm in my late 20s now and doing better, but it's been such an incredibly long, hard toad to get here. I'm down a little over 80lbs right now, and I'm on track to be down a full 100 by my birthday in early July. I had to completely relearn my relationship with food, physical activity, and health in general. I do an insane amount of research on food choices and diet and health. \nAll of this to say if these things had been more important to my parents (if they had better led by example) or had they been better educated in nutrition and overall health then perhaps I would have had an easier time with it myself. It is vital that children learn, and be shown, what a healthy lifestyle looks like early on, and be well educated on both. Your concerns are very valid, and approaching your sister about it was a good idea. No child should ever be made to feel shame or guilt for their weight, or for what they have been taught.

I asked my mom why my legs were bigger, and her response?

And as others have mentioned, children SHOULD be gaining weight, because they\u2019re growing. Their body size will fluctuate as they go through growth cycles. I\u2019d be way more concerned if a 7 year old hadn\u2019t gained a few pounds in an entire year. \n\nIf your concern is her asthma and weak lungs, talk about her asthma and weak lungs.

I didn\u2019t mean to criticize, and I\u2019m sorry for bringing it up like that.\u201d \n\nUltimately this is the truth. And what you think you needed growing up may not be what this child needs.

For many, \"I'm concerned about your lifestyle\" = \"You're letting yourself be fat.\"\n\nMy parents talked about vegetables in the context of different nutrients, and talked about junk food as something we had the privilege to avoid.

Weight is a complex and sensitive issue that everyone grapples with in their own way. You might be 100% correct, but it's possible to be right and still be a rude, overbearing asshole. I know because I have been overweight for most of my life and have only in recent years hit a healthy size. I've learned a lot in the process, which often makes me feel like an \"expert\" and prone to giving unsolicited advice. I know it's coming from a place of caring and wanting to help, but not everyone sees it or receives it that way, and I need to respect that.

They eat what tastes good and what feels good to eat. It\u2019s the parents job to teach moderation and healthy eating habits. I of course wouldn\u2019t say anything to your niece directly, but you were right to voice your concerns to her mother. There\u2019s not much you can do now, though. She can either choose to take it seriously or ignore you. Either way you\u2019ve done your part.", "NTA. As much as people want to believe otherwise, being overweight is usually not healthy and can cause so many health. Had you told your niece to her face that she\u2019s fat and needs to lose weight, that would have been an AH move, but going to her mom wasn\u2019t. Good for you, trying to help a child who\u2019s going through a similar situation you went through.", "YTA - I\u2019ve been a busy single mom. Its hard to just get food on the table. If you want to really help your niece, maybe offer to spend time with her more", "NTA. It sounds like there may have been a miscommunication or something poorly worded. (I have a talent for that). \n But the childs health is important, and weight isn\u2019t really the point, its a symptom, that food isnt good for anyone even if they dont gain weight from it.", "NTA. There\u2019s WAY too much of an issue made about body shaming (which is awful to do to someone regardless of their shape/size); but it\u2019s to the degree discussing the importance of health makes you a pariah. \n\nYou are right to remind your sister that a nutritious diet is in your niece\u2019s best interest. You are family and care more for her and niece than most will. It\u2019s sad that people are using fat shaming to disregard sound medical advice. I\u2019ve heard of people complaining about fat shaming when their doctor suggests they should lose weight.", "NTA. If my niece couldn\u2019t run a minute without wheezing I would be concerned too.\nAlso, I have an aunt who fed her kids crap all the time and now that\u2019s all my cousin will eat is junk. At 17 he had high blood pressure. \n I believe you\u2019re coming from a place of concern. It\u2019s different than being the family member who bullies the child into an eating disorder. I don\u2019t get that vibe from your post.", "Okay but running full out for a minute could make anyone out of breath. Are you talking like full on wheezing sounds or just out of breath? Little kids don't know how to run efficiently so they frequently run too fast or not at a sustainable rate. They also tend to have a flair for the dramatic so sometimes they act like they're dying when they're not really fully out of breath.\n\nI think the best thing you can do is set a positive example for her: take her to the park to run around, engage her in activities that promote fitness, offer to make snacks for her or share your healthy snacks with her. \n\nYour sister might be trying her best to appease a picky kid who only likes junk and you don't know what's been going on over the last year with their family routine/dynamic. Or she just might be too busy or overwhelmed to cook. Would've been a perfect opportunity for you to offer to run for groceries or to cook, but instead you just went with it and then decided to criticize her after the fact.\n\nI wouldn't do this to my sister. Moms are so overloaded with guilt all the time without you adding to it. Soft YTA because I know you meant well.", "NTA you painfully know more than most how much your neice will struggle. You where advising your sister on these issues on shaming your niece.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't fat shame your niece. You actually did the right thing by talking to her mom privately because you genuinely care about her health.", "NTA- It's okay to say something to your sister but now that you've said your advice you need to let it go. beta if you keep bringing it up", "yes but the self esteem thingy is also really true", "10/10", "What was the app called?", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA, you simply wanted to advise your sister on health concerns.", "downloading a tracking app = realizing I can eat a literal banquet of fruit if I just skip the soda", "This is true. What factors are leading to them eating out a lot", "Even if she doesn't doesn't have time to cook there are healthy ready-made meals and take outs. There are options besides McDonalds or pizza.", "Probably not! Everybody here is acting like the sister is acting out of concern when really she\u2019s projecting her childhood trauma onto her niece who may not feel the same way", "I don't see why it's a bad thing if their answer was \"no\".\n\nYou can have junk food in a house while also properly balancing it with healthier components of a diet and exercise. But if the niece is gaining a concerning amount of weight, that probably isn't happening and OP is justified in their concern.\n\nOP clearly wasn't trying to shame anyone. If they were, they would've talked to the daughter, not quietly to her sister.", "You should put dots or spaces in the Y T A, otherwise the bot counts that as your vote because you wrote it first", "r/usdefaultism", " I also have a family member with an overweight kid, all he eats is junk food or McDonald's", "Because fatphobia is insidious and all too common. That's why it is so typical in this forum.", "[removed]", "I think the issue is that OP was tactless. She didn\u2019t initiate a tactful conversation here; she didn\u2019t ask if sister had chatted with her Kid\u2019s doc, she didn\u2019t ask if sister was interested in some easy weeknight recipes to make ahead, she didn\u2019t offer advice. She \u201cadvised\u201d.", "If the house is full of nothing but junk and the eat more take out than not, I really doubt this kids nutritional needs are being met. If she can\u2019t play outside for even a short period of time without wheezing, I really doubt she had an adequate exercise/play regiment. \n\nSure, there\u2019s different body types. You can still control activity level and food intake at any size. Most people aren\u2019t naturally fat. You\u2019ve got to have some serious health issues for that to be the case, which isn\u2019t the grand majority of people who want something to blame other than themselves for being overweight.", "Right? The kid is 7, she has a ton of growing and maturing ahead of her and her body is going to change drastically. Sister is being a jerk", "Healthy habits have a lot to do with weight.", "I'd hope that even if she was thin, OP would have shown worry that her niece couldn't run one minute without wheezing. And the opposite, few extra kilos are just fine on an active, growing child. An active child, though, won't be wheezing after just one minute of play.", "I heard how fat I was as a kid. I hated myself. Got my period at 9; no more \u201cfat\u201d. However, the shame of being told how fat I was became anorexia. I battled that that many years and am finally free of that horrid disease. It took until I was 49 and many residential treatment centers to become completely free. Be careful what you say please. You may think you\u2019re being helpful; but you went about it in the wrong way.", "So a 300lb person can be healthy? Hilarious", ">She is doing the best she can.\n\nhow do you know?", ">Also, it's not your kid.\n\nso?", "no one and give advice/ or opinion?", "Yes, over-policing or controlling your kids diet will definitely cause longer-term issues, however you as the parent are responsible for your child's health and for teaching them how to manage their own diet. You can only restrict kids from eating things that you bring into the house in the first place. Teaching kids that there are no \"bad foods\" or \"good foods\" but that some foods give us more energy and make us feel better is important. Keeping a balance of healthier choices in the house along with \"junk\" food allows kids the ability to make their own choices. It just comes down to explaining the benefits of eating healthy food while reinforcing that \"junk\" food is perfectly fine too sometimes. Teach kids balance then give them understanding to make their own choices, while gently guiding them in a healthier direction. \n\nThere is a huge middle ground between \"restricting\" and \"enabling\".\n\nEdited to add a word I missed.", "stopping kids from over eating unhealthy foods is policing?", "But 7 year olds can be fat? I agree she shouldnt say it to the kid\u2019s face but objectively a child can be fat.", "Children have a much higher chance of gaining self esteem if they don't feel or literally are unhealthy. If anything it helps them.\n\nThe 2nd my parent found someone to date I was basically forgotten and ate myself into depression.

It has a lot of the nutritional info of barcoded products programmes in, so easy to keep track.", "And that's what I'm wondering.  We all look at body size as this great indicator of health.  If OP wouldn't have said anything if the niece was skinny I think it's more about vanity and a visceral reaction than an honest concern.", "Because she is making assumptions based on size that she wouldn't otherwise make.
