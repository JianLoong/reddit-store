If it is HER day, why\u2019s she making it about HIM. Huge red flag. This is your mom\u2019s own doing.", "NTA. If he is as rude as you claim, he deserves to feel hurt that he is being excluded. There is nothing wrong with excluding someone who behaves like an AH. Boundaries are hard to set precisely because people who are AHs get mad about them. Yours is a reasonable boundary.", "NTA......Don't blame you one bit, you don't have to tolerate him. Based on his creepy/weird comments to you, his exclusion is warranted.  She had a choice, she chose him.....oh well.", "NTA", "if it was just you hanging out with your mom it'd be a clear n/t/a but honestly I think this is ESH, even if he sucks.", "Gentle ESH - She knows you two don't get along, so why did she not plan two separate outings instead of forcing everyone to feel out of place during a moment that's meant to be celebratory?\n\nShe could have gone out with her husband one earlier, and then a sweet mother -daughter outing after. Or vice versa. Either way, it is leagues better than turning a happy holiday into what makes Thanksgiving the worst holiday ever for some people. Please, let's stop forcing people who don't like each other to spend time with each other. \n\nBut there is one thing, I would like to clarify. Your boundaries are your own. Not anyone else's. Try to be mindful that you don't set your boundaries so far off that they end up stepping over someone else's. Which isn't always an easy or clear thing as sometimes we can't tell how far is too far. You see, it's not up to you who decides to be with Mom on Mother's Day. Mother's Day is for mom, so it is actually her who draws that line. You can only enforce with whom you will spend time. You don't get to change her guest list, so to speak. And I can totally understand you didn't mean it that way, but it is on you to politely exclude yourself from the event if you cannot be in the same event as your mother's husband, which is understandable. \n\nThat's likely why she got more upset when you used boundaries that way. She felt she was being pressured to exclude her own husband while also being told that it is not her place to choose with whom she wants to celebrate with. A very easy misunderstanding to happen in a situation like this.\n\nWhich brings me back to the suggestion I made earlier. A good way to keep your boundaries personal while respecting your mother's wishes on Mother's Day is to have two separate outings. And honestly, given that this means she gets to celebrate twice, she -theoretically- should have twice the fun. \n\nWith that note aside, the situation you painted of your mother's relationship with that man reminds to what befell my late grandma. My grandma was manipulated into being a man's sugar mama for two going on three decades before he ultimately departs from her once she got too old, and left her with his debts. I can empathize with your concerns about him.\n\nYou may never be able to convince your mom to be critical of her husband, but you may record on your own time events that you think would come in handy to recall in a separation event. In short words, keep a few receipts as one day your mom may need them. Including any creepy encounters you have with him.\n\nEdit: Fixed typos and narration.", "YTA.

It\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, which is the day you\u2019re supposed to honor your mom and, ideally do something nice for her that she will enjoy. I completely understand not wanting to be anywhere near your mom\u2018s new skeevy boyfriend, (who does indeed sound like a real creep) however, your mom wanted to have dinner with everybody and since it\u2019s supposed to be a dinner to make her feel loved and appreciated it would have been nice to set aside your dislike and do your best to have the nice \u201cfamily\u201d dinner she was hoping for. Also, if you wanna help your mom get rid of this guy faster, it will be easier for you to do that, and easier for her to ask for help from you later, if you keep your responses to him pretty neutral. Otherwise, you just end up putting her in a position of having to defend him, which, in the end might make it harder for her to see what an unpleasant person he really is.", "NTA, but at the same time you are.  Of course set your boundaries, but if this was the first time you told her you didn't want him around then that's where you made the mistake.  She could have pre planned dinner for him or something. Also you should have told her right away anytime he said something that made you uncomfortable.
