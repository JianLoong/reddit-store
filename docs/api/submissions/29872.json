I've met his fiancee a few times aside from that and I've always got on with her.\n\nAnyway, when my mate announced they had gotten engaged, I was thrilled like the rest of our friend group. He was buzzing for weeks but then one day he told me that his fiancee wanted a child free wedding which I found a little weird since she has a nephew around my daughter's age (she mentioned him when she met my daughter). It's her wedding and if she wants it to be child free that's fine but after thinking about it, I told my mate I wasn't going to attend but he and his fiancee had my love and support. \n\nHe understood why I declined the invite but a day or two later, his fiancee texted me to ask why I wasn't going to the wedding and I told her that I'm so used spending time with my daughter that I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself. That was last week but three days ago, she texted me again asking if I would reconsider, reasoning that my mate would be disappointed if I wasn't there for him but I reiterated that I wasn't really interested.\n\nSince it's just me and my girl, we have a very close bond and I don't want to be away from her for that long because I would just worry about her. AITA for turning down the invite?\n\nEdit to add: A lot of you have been criticising me for not wanting to leave my daughter overnight. She's only four so of course I'm worried.

Some children can really create havoc/stress, and allowing exceptions will cause hard feelings for the parents whose children were not asked, so it is much simpler to be child free.\n\nThat means that some people will have to decline. Could be a separation issue with a young child, could be a breastfeeding mom who truly can't leave her young one, could be they have no reliable sitter, could be they don't have the money to pay for a long period of sitting.  Could be like you, you just don't want to leave your child for that long a period of time.  Nobody should be upset or pressuring people to change their mind.   I liken it to a destination wedding.  If you choose a destination wedding a lot of people are going to decline because of the expense and time commitment or even availability of vacation time.

He did not specify that, actually indicated a few hours originally.", "When people exclude children from their weddings they've gotta understand that some parents will choose not to attend", "Nta but rely on your support system.

He's still free to do that, but it's doesn't make him not an AH in that case.", "He is not TA at all.  I hate the pressure he is getting.", "I had the impression that because the fianc\u00e9e has a young nephew, OP is suspicious that his daughter is the only child not invited.\n\nIt's weird that the fianc\u00e9e contacted him twice when he declined; I smell a setup."]}
