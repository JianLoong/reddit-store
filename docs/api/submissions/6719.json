They haven't had your experiences with that person.", "NTA. She was never your aunt in the first place. Step mom is the title normally given here.

She was abusive towards you, and you have no obligation to make her feel good when she\u2019s never tried to do the same for you.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like perfect candidates for your very own NC list.

It was bad enough calling her aunt when you were married, making it sound like you were with your sister or something. She\u2019s nothing to me. She\u2019s not my mom, my stepmom or my aunt. Her name is Isabelle and that\u2019s what I\u2019m calling her. She abused me mentally and verbally while you were married to her and you did nothing to protect me. She didn\u2019t earn my respect then, why would I respect her now?\u201d\n\nNTA. Why do you even have to interact with her at all any more??? Does your mom know how she and your dad treated you?", "NTA. You don't owe her anything.", "Titles such as mom, dad, auntie, etc are a privilege, not a right. NTA.", "So if she wants to be addressed by a title rather than her name, maybe it's time for a bit of malicious compliance - start calling her \"ex-stepmother\", because that's exactly what she is.", "She isn't related to you. She and your father are the assholes in this situation. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. She actually isn't your aunt, so why would you call her that?", "NTA and she was never your aunt in the first place ...", "NTA. \n\nI think it is odd to call a step-mom 'auntie' in the first place, because the implied relationship to your mom, but anyway... \n\nIt seems 'auntie' was meant to be a term of respect for your step-mom. But from what you've said, your step-mom didn't do anything to earn your respect; rather, the complete opposite. And by calling her by her first name, you ***are*** still being respectful towards her. I mean, you could be referring to her by her nature, instead of her name.", "NTA.\n\nI had a step mother (dad passed), I always called her by first name. She was never auntie or anything like that. Her siblings are aunt/uncle/cousin (depending of the age difference). And my country has a very heavy culture of \"familiarize\" acquaintances.\n\nNothing wrong with using names. You're not required to use a family title to someone who's nothing to you. Specially if they are toxic assholes.", "Why is your stepmom your aunt?", "NTA, she\u2019s basically a stranger now. I guess it would be different if she was kind and loving. But she wasn\u2019t.

As others have said, how you feel towards another person can\u2019t be instructed by anyone else. If she wanted some kind of special title, she should have worked a little harder to treat you in such a way that would have earned it, felt natural and appropriate to you. Call her whatever you want, and don\u2019t let anyone else instruct or force you into any kind of relationship with her you don\u2019t want to have.", "NTA - an aunt is blood or an honorific title. It seems she is not blood and has no honour.", "NTA. \n\nAlso weird that he had you calling her aunt when they were married.", "NTA.
