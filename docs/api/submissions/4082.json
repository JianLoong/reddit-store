My wife Jenna (28F) and I (32M) had our daughter Averlea 6 months ago. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years and married for 3. \n\nWe both live out of state from our families and neither of us have the best relationship with them, though Jenna\u2019s family have made a lot of effort to come and visit, mend bridges, and interact with Averlea since she was born. My family (mom 52F, stepdad 55M, 3 younger brothers 17-21M) live an extra few hours away and are yet to meet her.  It\u2019s important to note that my mom and Jenna do NOT get along. Mom has always had something to say about Jenna and the older Jenna\u2019s gotten and the longer it\u2019s gone on the less Jenna has been willing to let it go over her head. This has resulted in us spending the last 10 years doing separate holiday visits.\n\nMy plan this year was to drop Jenna at her parents place safely after the flight and then carry on the extra 3 hour drive with Averlea to mine, and then pick her up on December 23rd so we could spend Christmas Day as a family. Jenna\u2019s response was simply \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nIn our house, no is usually a complete sentence, but I asked her why and her response was \u201cwe talked about this when I was pregnant. You never had my back with your mom so I don\u2019t trust you to advocate for Averlea, and since she\u2019s made no effort to be around her, I\u2019m not comfortable with letting you take our baby into that environment without me, and I am not going to go somewhere it\u2019s evident I\u2019m not wanted\u201d \n\nI brought up the fact that I want my daughter to know my step/parents and her side of the family and that Jenna was stopping that from happening, and how unfair it was to my mom given that her parents have been here atleast twice a month since she\u2019s been born and have been able to have that bonding time. \n\nI told her I would drop her off and take Averlea anyway, or me and Averlea would fly in to my parents home airport, but one way or another she would be meeting them this Christmas. That is when Jenna just cracked and broke. She started BAWLING and repeating how she \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d put her in that position\u201d and when I told this story to my best friend at the pub, even he raised his eyebrow and said that it wasn\u2019t a good move. Jenna has been sleeping on the couch and I\u2019m beginning to feel awful and second guess everything. \n\nWIBTA or am I right in standing my ground here? \n\nTLDR - Wife doesn\u2019t want our daughter to meet my family. I am insisting.

That is why they should not meet your daughter on their own.\n\nAnd why does your wife have to continue to look past this treatment? Why does your mother get to continue to speak badly about her?\n\n\"It's unfair to my mom that her parents have gotten to see baby\"\n\nYOUR MOM PUT HERSELF IN THIS POSITION!\n\nYou don't get to treat someone like crap for a decade then surprise pikachu face when they don't want their baby around you. If your mom wants to see the baby, she should try to make amends.\n\nAt this point, it's clear they aren't going to be best friends, but she does have to treat wife with cordial respect. \n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nWhat has your family done to warrant such consideration? Your family is toxic. They\u2019re abusive. They\u2019ve made no real effort to make amends in the current situation like your wife\u2019s parents have. Using the reasoning that her parents have met your daughter so yours should is unfair. Her parents are actively trying to do the right thing. Yours are still putting out the minimal effort, if you can even say that. \n\nIf what she claims is correct, that you don\u2019t support her or advocate for her when your mother is being verbally and emotionally abusive toward your wife, then she\u2019s absolutely correct that your daughter should not be exposed to them. Nor should your wife have to endure your family when she is abused by them just for the sake of letting them meet your kid. \n\nYour wife should not be punished for your mom\u2019s behavior. Your mom should be punished for your mom\u2019s behavior. Instead you\u2019re giving your mother what she wants and undermining and invalidating your wife\u2019s feelings and opinions. \n\nYour mom, and maybe even the rest of your family, is toxic and you should be supporting your family unit rather than your extended family. Your wife and your daughter should be above anyone else. I can\u2019t believe that you\u2019d let your mother go for over a decade being cruel and abusive toward your wife without putting a stop to it. That should have been done years ago, and not by moving away and not bringing her to family gatherings.  It should have been your mom is told you be nice to her or you don\u2019t get either of us. What will she be like to your daughter? Trust me, from experience I can say, your mom won\u2019t change if she has no reason to. And that will at some point spiral down to your children who are too much like your wife , and your mother will disapprove and say nasty things to them too. Been there done that with my on in-laws. \n\nAlso. Think about it, your asking a mother, and a very new mom at that, to be separated for days from her child. No good mom would ever be okay with that. New moms are overly protective and nervous under the best of circumstances, but being separated for long periods of time is pure torture.  Add in the history of verbal and emotional abuse and the constant worry if her kid is being abused is a recipe for a meltdown if not a nervous breakdown from any good mom.\n\nAlso, you do realize that if you take your child without your wife\u2019s permission, as the co-parent, she could call the police and file a kidnapping charge against you, right? Just because you are the dad doesn\u2019t mean your free to override your wife\u2019s consent.", "YTA\n\nYour family has not made an effort. That's telling. Your mom bashes your wife, and you say nothing. That's even more telling. You're setting a bad example for your daughter and how people and partners should treat her. \n\nMy paternal grandmother is a drama queen. On my mom's wedding' day, she said she was losing her son and not gaining anything. She always had a bit of fakeness growing up and as I got older, I saw how she treated my mom and how my dad really did nothing. His side of the family would only be interested in talking to me or my mother when it involved something with my dad. My maternal grandparents came to see me a lot growing up, I spent time with them, and the extended family went out of the way so many times for me. Guess which side of the family I don't have a relationship with?", "YTA.. your mom has treated your wife poorly with you not defending her.\nWhy don\u2019t you invite them to your city and have them stay in a hotel so they can still meet the baby for a bit and not be an overnight thing without Jenna when she doesn\u2019t trust your mom and with good reason I might add. \n\nYou said your family hasn\u2019t even made an attempt to meet her in the 6 months she has been alive but yet, your blaming your wife for that? Have you ever even taken care of the baby by yourself for that long?", "YTA-You wouldn\u2019t stand up for your wife. Your daughter doesn\u2019t need a relationship with people who are assholes to her mother.", "YTA Jesus man sort your priorities out, your family treats your wife like shit and you are basically telling them it's fine. IF THEY DON'T RESPECT THE MOTHER THEY DO NOT GET TO PLAY HAPPY FAMILIES WITH HER CHILD. This would be my absolute hill to die on and I would totally understand if she left you over this.", "YTA. Your daughter won't remember any of this so that argument is silly. Secondly you mentioned Jenna's parents have come down multiple times but yours haven't seen her yet. They couldn't be bothered to see their grandchild??? Lastly you made no effort to compromise here or consider Jenna's feelings.", "YTA- if your wife said that you never had her back, she\u2019s got all the reasons to trust that the baby might be treated or cared for in a way that she wouldn\u2019t approve. This doesn\u2019t mean badly cared for, just not cared as if she would. I kind of understand her. \nPlus if you had an agreement during pregnancy, why breaking it?\nAs you say her family did a lot to mend, can you say the same for your family?", "YTA for claiming your wife is preventing them from meeting when it sounds like they've made no attempt to visit you. \n\nHave you even cared for/fed the baby by yourself? She's only 6 months and you don't mention how long  you plan to separate baby from her mother.", "YTA and this might just be what breaks her down and you might just return to divorce papers honestly. Hope you are okay with that just to please your precious mommy", "YWBTA and probably damaging your marriage.\n\n\nYou mentioned Jenna getting older and not letting things going over her heard. Why does she need to? Why is your mom not accountable for how she treats her?\n\nYour wife isn\u2019t comfortable with you and your baby being there\u2026.so there is mostly likely a pattern of her being treated poorly and you letting it happen.\n\nPeople who are trusted by parents don\u2019t get exclusive access to babies.\n\nMaybe try a neutral place to meet for a short time with your wife if it\u2019s something she\u2019d be comfortable with doing.", "YTA. Your wife is absolutely correct- she had put up with your mom\u2019s arseholery for 10 years. 10 years where you obviously didn\u2019t have her back or your mother would have shut up and figured out a way to coexist by now. Your wife is definitely correct. You need to figure out a way to talk to your mom and say, \u201cNow that my daughter is here, the rude comments and jerk behaviour stops. Period.\u201d \n\nAlso, a 6 month old is still pretty reliant on her mother. \n\nAlso also, I can\u2019t believe your wife has been sleeping on the couch. You\u2019re lucky it hasn\u2019t been a hotel!! If I was her, it wouldn\u2019t be the couch and it wouldn\u2019t be me. \n\nI\u2019m honestly just shocked at the ignorance here. I can\u2019t believe OP doesn\u2019t realise his behaviour and how completely messed up this situation is for his wife.", "INFO: So, do you actually stand up for your wife to your mother?\n\nEdit: Honestly, this doesn't even matter. I wouldn't want my child around an anti-vaxxer who very blatantly treated me badly either. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, you don't have you're wife's back and now you're reaping the rewards of your cowardice", "Yta if they don\u2019t respect either parent they don\u2019t get access to child", "YTA. Whatever fantasy you've concocted about how great things could be, you're likely to end up with the opposite", "INFO: why can't your family make the effort to come to you, as hers has?", "YTA\n\nYour wife is correct. If you have proven yourself incapable of protecting your wife from your family, then you aren't going to protect your daughter either.\n\nThe very fact you want to take your daughter to people who don't like *her mother, your wife* shows you would let your family do and say whatever they want to your daughter, because you would prioritise \"not rocking the boat\" over anything else.\n\nYou should be telling your extended family that your nuclear family (that's you, your wife, and your daughter) are a package deal and if they can't be kind and respectful to your wife, they won't be given the chance to mistreat your daughter the same way. \n\nTheres no such thing as \"making it fair\" when it comes to protecting your child.", "YTA \n\nYour family have made zero effort to meet your child - hers have. That\u2019s not a great sign of how important they think this is.\n\nThey treat your wife and partner of 10 years poorly. \n\nHer family have - by your admission- made an effort to repair relationships.\n\nYou then dictate what happens because it makes things easier for you? You sound like you\u2019ve not supported your wife and thought of the impact on your child at all.", "YTA your side of the family has had ample time to meet the new kid but clearly hasn't bothered. Your family is now you, your wife and your baby and you're willing to split the unit up over Christmas for the baby to meet people that aren't particularly interested in her and she won't remember anyway. I think you owe your wife an apology", "YTA - Your mom treats your wife horribly and you have done nothing about it. It is not your wife's responsibility to let the nasty things your mom says just \"go over her head\". It is your mom's responsibility to be civil to your wife - and if she won't, it is your responsibility to stand up for your wife. Your wife is protecting herself and your daughter from your mother, because she knows that you won't. \n\nYour wife is not keeping your daughter from meeting your parents. Your parents could have visited at any time in the past 6 months.", "YTA - dude... if your mom would be interested in the slightest to see your daughter, she would have flown to your place, at least once in half a year. Half a year! You can't tell me that there was no time to plan a visit or to safe up for the tickets if money is the problem. IF your mom would have wanted to be there, she would have made it possible. \n\nAnd you want to drag your infant daughter to a person who doesn't care enough about her to visit once? To a person who hates your wife and made her life so miserable? I can completely understand your wife's fears and how devastating it has to feel and how gutted she has to be that you want to put her child into that (perceived) danger she fears your mother might pose to her. Maybe the worst your mother does is to ignore the child, but for your wife you take your daughter to a horrible place. And you, who should have her back, told her you would do it no matter what and there is nothing she can do to stop you. She has to feel so desperate and powerless. You are a horrible partner!", "If what your wife says is true about you not having her back and your family not making an effort to be around the baby, then it kinda sounds like you\u2019re the AH. You\u2019re a family and you come as a pack. Not saying you should never make an effort for your family to get to know the baby, but Mom has a right to be there if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with the situation.", "YTA and your desperation for validation from a family that has no interest in you or your daughter is very sad. You owe you're wife an apology and hope she doesn't end your marriage over this.", "YTA. Your family ostracizes the person you\u2019ve chosen as a partner, the person who *carried their grandchild* and you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll take her child *against her wishes* where she isn\u2019t welcome when your family refuses to make the trip. \n\nHow on earth do you spell that out and not see where you\u2019re TA?", "YTA. She's not stopping your family from meeting your daughter. She's stopping you from taking your infant away for 4 days to go visit people who actively dislike someone who has been a part of their family for 10 years, and who she doesn't trust. \n\nIf you knew that your family meeting Averlea was important, facilitating that relationship is YOUR responsibility. You needed to start working on this 1.5 years ago. You needed to tell your mother to quit with the nasty, childish bs and stand up for your wife. You needed to make it clear that disrespecting your wife and mother of your daughter means they don't deserve access to your family. You needed to be making plans for them to visit before such a major holiday, which was always going to be more difficult. \nNot doing any of the ground work and just expecting your wife to be ok with you demanding that you take your infant daughter to go hang out in a house full of people she doesn't trust for 4 days is so thoughtless. \n\nHonestly, the very thought of that probably would've made me sick when my baby was that age.", "YTA for allowing your mother to attack your wife. Wanting to repair your relationship with your family is understandable, but introducing them to your child is not the same thing as waving a magic wand that will make them stop being horrible people. You should have a chat with your mother about burying the hatchet and tell her that you expect her to apologize to Jenna and make amends before you introduce her to your child.", "You can not be serious?! My god YTA and I can\u2019t wait to read some of the replies to this. Jesus Christ\u2026", "YTA\nJenna is right. Your mom is hostile to your wife and you don't stand up for her. Of course she's not going to trust you that you can stand up for your baby either. I don't understand why are you separated from Jenna during Christmas, why are you not traveling together and why is Averlea staying with you?\n\nYou need to set clear boundaries with your mom. If she wants a relationship with her granddaughter, she has to respect Janna and apologize. Janna's family is actively trying to improve the relationship, that's a huge difference. Your mom doesn't care and isn't willing to make things better.\n\nFrom the way you talk about your mother it's clear you are enabling her behaviour. You say you are low contact with your mom, yet you have million excuses why she won't change her behaviour. You made a promise to your wife when she was pregnant, doesn't matter that you thought she'll \"mellow\". \n\nContinue this way and you'll find yourself divorced.", "Ok hear me out... Has it occured to you to actually try to figure out why this is upsetting her so much?

You want to take your six month old to a crazy person who advocates against vaccinating for a deadly disease? Honestly, I hope she takes the baby and leaves you before this happens.", "YTA. Your wife's family can make the effort and the trip to meet your daughter. \n\nYour family apparently can't be bothered with that effort. \n\nYour wife's family don't seem to go out their way to make you uncomfortable.

YTA", "Ywbta. By all accounts it doesn\u2019t sound like your wife is unreasonable at all. Unfortunately your mother created this dynamic and now will have to live with the consequences. Just to be clear if you choose to take your daughter against your wife\u2019s wishes expect to be divorced soon. I wouldn\u2019t stay with a man that never defended me against his family and still chooses them over me during a time that should be happy. And just to be clear it\u2019s terrible separating a parent from their child over people like that.

You can't just overrule your wife's decision here and essentially threaten to do something she's clearly very uncomfortable with.\n\nThe fact that you've said it's \"unfair to your mum\" is the icing on the cake - your wife doesn't have to go about life in consideration of your mum, especially given how rude your mum seems to be.", "6 months is young to take a baby away from the mother,  especially to people who the baby is not familiar with.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nWhy don\u2019t your mom and stepdad make the effort to come and visit you and your baby instead.

Your best friend at the pub seems to agree with Jenna, which leads me to suspect that you are leaving out details that would justify her reaction. What is it that you haven't had her back over?\n\nYou might be TA because it looks like you left out important details in order to make your wife look unreasonable, throwing her under the bus so you could get internet validation.", "YTA your wife explained her very reasonable thoughts as to why she doesn\u2019t want this. You heard it enough to type it out but not to onboard it in your mind.", "OP, I have to tell you, my ex husband did this to me shortly before we split. I was pregnant with our second and he threatened to take our older child away for a few days with his side of the family - specifically his alcoholic sister-in-law and his a-hole brother who has never apologized a day in his life. I was crying hysterically, because he threatened to take our child whether I liked it or not. I wasn't invited. \n\nWe are now divorced.\n\nYTA. Stop intimidating your wife by saying you'll just take your daughter. Especially to an environment that she doesn't trust. You are a family unit. Remember that or its not going to stay that way.", "YTA but good news: After your wife divorces you over this, you can take your kid to see your parents during your custody time. \n\nI cannot believe you would put your baby at risk like this for a rude antivaxer who can\u2019t be assed to come see you.", "YTA. \n\nI, too, am raising my eyebrow at you. \n\nIt is clear from your post - despite your likely attempt at neutralizing this to some degree - that your mother is horrible to Jenna and that you've never interceded on Jenna's behalf. \n\nI don't blame Jenna one IOTA for her reaction and why she's now sleeping on the couch, though I'd say you're even more the asshole for not insisting that you take the couch yourself as you surely deserve it at this moment. \n\nFact is, if your mom wanted to meet her granddaughter so badly, she could travel to see you (and stay in a hotel), just as Jenna's family has now regularly done. Last I checked, interstates and planes travel both ways between cities. \n\nThat you decided to make an entire plan that involved separating a 6 month old from her mother is obtuse beyond all words. Especially THIS plan, that involved leaving Jenna three hours away from her baby, her baby that is going to a house where at least one person there can't stand her mother and has made that perfectly clear. \n\nHard, hard pass. If you want Averlea to meet your mom, there are other ways to do this. If your mom doesn't care enough to come all the way to see you, can she not at least drive the three hours to Jenna's parents' town and meet Averlea there? I'm guessing that answer is \"no\", and the only way she'll actually meet the baby is if you/Jenna do all the work towards making it happen, which only underlines Jenna's point even more. \n\nYou are in the wrong, period.", "INFO.

Why should Jenna be the only one to 'let it go over her head' in this situation rather than your mother apologising and learning to conduct herself like an adult?\n\nJenna rightly opts to protect her child, as a good parent should, from the possibilty of similiar treatment from someone who has already proved they are not to be trusted as they unable or unwilling to act in a positive manner toward others.  \n\nNow you compound the entire issue by issuing an ultimatum stating you will be taking your young child to see this person, period.  This road you are on will take you straight to divorce. Worse, if your child does get exposed to this kind of toxicity, not only can this hurt her but it is very likely that your ultimate relationship with her, as well, will be impacted negatively.\n\nPerhaps you should have a good long think about the situation as a whole and the potential ramifications to everyone involved.  Jenna and your daughter are supposed to come first in your life.", "YTA & a major one too as a husband & father. You refuse to see how wrong you & your mom are especially you after every one is telling you why you are wrong. You are just as obstinate as your mother. I feel horrible for your wife being married & having a child with a man who doesn't have her back.", "Let's just spell this out. If your mother wants to meet your daughter then your mother should come for a visit. As a prerequisite for the visit she needs to be vaccinated to protect your daughter.

The fact is your family doesn\u2019t like you and you\u2019re trying to use a baby as a tool to get them interested in your life. But she\u2019s not an object, she\u2019s a person. It\u2019s not appropriate for a parent to use a child like that. \n\nYou need therapy to unpack your family issues. When you\u2019ve made some breakthroughs, you\u2019ll stop chasing them and being desperate for their attention. Good luck.", "YTA, big time. Wow. You never had her back in the first place and now you\u2019re actively turning the daggers your family sank into her back. If you really do this, I hope your wife gets the best divorce lawyer ever. \n\nIf your family gave a damn about your daughter, they\u2018d make sure to mend bridges and most importantly, they\u2019d come to visit in a way that\u2019s convenient for you and your wife. But instead, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s absolutely willing to sacrifice your marriage to create a bond that won\u2018t even happen. Disgusting. Your kid is a baby who\u2019s going to see some strangers for a short time. She won\u2019t remember them even if they treat the baby better than they treat her mother.\n\nETA Way to leave out that on top of your mom being a spiteful AH, she\u2019s also an antivaxxer who simply isn\u2019t a safe contact for a baby even if she were the sweetest person otherwise.", "It's not that she doesn't wanna meet up with your family. It's the fact that the mom has issue with the wife.", "YTA - and a shit husband", "So your wife has very VALID reasons to think, that you are not able to protect your daughter from your mother, because you where spineless, even when your wife was pregnant... And you really think it's a good idea to destroy her trust further, by doing something she doesn't approve of?! WTF dude are you insane?\n\nIf you love your wife and your daughter, you need your family to proof they are capable of being around your baby while respecting you, your wife and your boundaries. \n\nMaybe your wife would be fine with them visiting a few times and showing, that they are able to change and then you can visit them together later. All to your and your wifes conditiones. But taking her infant without her consent would be a major AH move.\n\nImagine your 3 year old tells her grandmother she doesn't like to be touched in a certain way.

I can\u2019t promise to be a good MIL, but I will be civil. And I will do everything I can to make this relationship work.\u201d\n\nMy mom has a rocky relationship with some of my siblings. You know what she does? Bites her tongue and works within the boundaries siblings give her. And boundaries get expanded as trust is strengthened.\n\nYou should talk to a professional about the grief you have over your daughter\u2019s non-relationship with your family.

Good luck with that. \n\nYTA", "Hooooooly YTA. Big time. No question. First off: as a parent you shouldn\u2019t take your child on any trip that the other parent doesn\u2019t approve of. Second: she expressed her concerns and you just steamrolled those. You made an authoritative, unfair decision. Third: I don\u2019t see any comments about your parents making the trip to come see your daughter like her parents do.

Your wife isn't stopping them from visiting, your mom has shown no interest in your child. Have your wife's back for once and stand up for her!

YTA for that alone. You both are parents, you both have a voice that\u2019s equally important and it\u2019s not because you think that you\u2019re right that you can bypass her.\n\nNow to the matter, it\u2019s not unreasonable from her to expect to be there when your family will meet your baby and even if she got along better with your parents, it\u2019s normal to want to be able to monitor other people behaviour around your baby.\n\nThe issue you have is that, in order to have your family present in the life of your daughter, your parents have to be at least on normal terms with the mother of your child. They never apologised and she doesn\u2019t want to come spend an uncomfortable Christmas with them knowing they don\u2019t like her. If your parents want this baby in their life, they should make amends too. A first step could have been an encounter outside, lunch or something, or them coming into your house to see this baby once.

TLDR at the bottom. My wife Jenna (28F) and I (32M) had our daughter Averlea 6 months ago. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years and married for 3. \n\nWe both live out of state from our families and neither of us have the best relationship with them, though Jenna\u2019s family have made a lot of effort to come and visit, mend bridges, and interact with Averlea since she was born. My family (mom 52F, stepdad 55M, 3 younger brothers 17-21M) live an extra few hours away and are yet to meet her.  It\u2019s important to note that my mom and Jenna do NOT get along. Mom has always had something to say about Jenna and the older Jenna\u2019s gotten and the longer it\u2019s gone on the less Jenna has been willing to let it go over her head. This has resulted in us spending the last 10 years doing separate holiday visits.\n\nMy plan this year was to drop Jenna at her parents place safely after the flight and then carry on the extra 3 hour drive with Averlea to mine, and then pick her up on December 23rd so we could spend Christmas Day as a family. Jenna\u2019s response was simply \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nIn our house, no is usually a complete sentence, but I asked her why and her response was \u201cwe talked about this when I was pregnant. You never had my back with your mom so I don\u2019t trust you to advocate for Averlea, and since she\u2019s made no effort to be around her, I\u2019m not comfortable with letting you take our baby into that environment without me, and I am not going to go somewhere it\u2019s evident I\u2019m not wanted\u201d \n\nI brought up the fact that I want my daughter to know my step/parents and her side of the family and that Jenna was stopping that from happening, and how unfair it was to my mom given that her parents have been here atleast twice a month since she\u2019s been born and have been able to have that bonding time. \n\nI told her I would drop her off and take Averlea anyway, or me and Averlea would fly in to my parents home airport, but one way or another she would be meeting them this Christmas. That is when Jenna just cracked and broke. She started BAWLING and repeating how she \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d put her in that position\u201d and when I told this story to my best friend at the pub, even he raised his eyebrow and said that it wasn\u2019t a good move. Jenna has been sleeping on the couch and I\u2019m beginning to feel awful and second guess everything. \n\nWIBTA or am I right in standing my ground here? \n\nTLDR - Wife doesn\u2019t want our daughter to meet my family.

You\u2019re threatening to take your daughter even after she said no. She has literally no faith in you defending your daughter against your mom because you never did with her.

I'm surprised she is still with you. Do you know how people speak about men who continue to choose mommy after they're married/have children? Have you ever thought to contemplate the reasons for such widely held opinions?\n\nAnother cut and dry example is your wife's family making the effort to make amends and visit several times over the past 6 months. Your parents haven't done jack. They continue to abuse your wife and they choose not to meet their granddaughter. Your parent's behavior screams that they don't care about their abusive and cruel behavior. \n\nThe fact that you think your parents will overlook 50% of your child's DNA and child's mother shows that you refuse to recognize unrepentant AHs and you will allow them to abuse your innocent child.\n\nYes, you will allow it. You won't stand up for an innocent adult (your wife) so you definitely won't stand up for a child who cannot speak for themselves.

Don\u2019t go to theirs for Christmas and instead learn to grow some balls and a spine and stick up for the person you chose to love unconditionally and spend the rest of your life with.

But your mom cares more about being right than about meeting the baby, and your proposed answer to this is to take the baby away from your wife against her will. You are a very bad husband, and a pretty bad father, too. If you keep this up, you\u2019ll be able to take your baby to see your mom whenever you want, on your own custody time, presuming the custody agreement allows you to leave the state with the baby.

I don\u2019t know about your wife\u2019s post partum emotions but none of my friends could be parted from their infant for a couple of days, at all. The parental/maternal anxiety is extreme. And finally,  your mother dosnt deserve to meet the baby. She is a rug sweeper, she\u2019s rude, she\u2019s seemingly narcisstic and she\u2019s lazy.
