My wife Jenna (28F) and I (32M) had our daughter Averlea 6 months ago. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years and married for 3. \n\nWe both live out of state from our families and neither of us have the best relationship with them, though Jenna\u2019s family have made a lot of effort to come and visit, mend bridges, and interact with Averlea since she was born. My family (mom 52F, stepdad 55M, 3 younger brothers 17-21M) live an extra few hours away and are yet to meet her.  It\u2019s important to note that my mom and Jenna do NOT get along. Mom has always had something to say about Jenna and the older Jenna\u2019s gotten and the longer it\u2019s gone on the less Jenna has been willing to let it go over her head. This has resulted in us spending the last 10 years doing separate holiday visits.\n\nMy plan this year was to drop Jenna at her parents place safely after the flight and then carry on the extra 3 hour drive with Averlea to mine, and then pick her up on December 23rd so we could spend Christmas Day as a family. Jenna\u2019s response was simply \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nIn our house, no is usually a complete sentence, but I asked her why and her response was \u201cwe talked about this when I was pregnant. You never had my back with your mom so I don\u2019t trust you to advocate for Averlea, and since she\u2019s made no effort to be around her, I\u2019m not comfortable with letting you take our baby into that environment without me, and I am not going to go somewhere it\u2019s evident I\u2019m not wanted\u201d \n\nI brought up the fact that I want my daughter to know my step/parents and her side of the family and that Jenna was stopping that from happening, and how unfair it was to my mom given that her parents have been here atleast twice a month since she\u2019s been born and have been able to have that bonding time. \n\nI told her I would drop her off and take Averlea anyway, or me and Averlea would fly in to my parents home airport, but one way or another she would be meeting them this Christmas. That is when Jenna just cracked and broke. She started BAWLING and repeating how she \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d put her in that position\u201d and when I told this story to my best friend at the pub, even he raised his eyebrow and said that it wasn\u2019t a good move. Jenna has been sleeping on the couch and I\u2019m beginning to feel awful and second guess everything. \n\nWIBTA or am I right in standing my ground here? \n\nTLDR - Wife doesn\u2019t want our daughter to meet my family. I am insisting.

That is why they should not meet your daughter on their own.\n\nAnd why does your wife have to continue to look past this treatment? Why does your mother get to continue to speak badly about her?\n\n\"It's unfair to my mom that her parents have gotten to see baby\"\n\nYOUR MOM PUT HERSELF IN THIS POSITION!\n\nYou don't get to treat someone like crap for a decade then surprise pikachu face when they don't want their baby around you. If your mom wants to see the baby, she should try to make amends.\n\nAt this point, it's clear they aren't going to be best friends, but she does have to treat wife with cordial respect. \n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nWhat has your family done to warrant such consideration? Your family is toxic. They\u2019re abusive. They\u2019ve made no real effort to make amends in the current situation like your wife\u2019s parents have. Using the reasoning that her parents have met your daughter so yours should is unfair. Her parents are actively trying to do the right thing. Yours are still putting out the minimal effort, if you can even say that. \n\nIf what she claims is correct, that you don\u2019t support her or advocate for her when your mother is being verbally and emotionally abusive toward your wife, then she\u2019s absolutely correct that your daughter should not be exposed to them. Nor should your wife have to endure your family when she is abused by them just for the sake of letting them meet your kid. \n\nYour wife should not be punished for your mom\u2019s behavior. Your mom should be punished for your mom\u2019s behavior. Instead you\u2019re giving your mother what she wants and undermining and invalidating your wife\u2019s feelings and opinions. \n\nYour mom, and maybe even the rest of your family, is toxic and you should be supporting your family unit rather than your extended family. Your wife and your daughter should be above anyone else. I can\u2019t believe that you\u2019d let your mother go for over a decade being cruel and abusive toward your wife without putting a stop to it. That should have been done years ago, and not by moving away and not bringing her to family gatherings.  It should have been that your mom was told \u201cyou be nice to Jenna or you don\u2019t get either of us\u201d. \n\nWhat will she be like to your daughter? Trust me, from experience I can say your mom won\u2019t change if she has no reason to. And that will, at some point, spiral down to your children who are too much like your wife, and your mother will disapprove and say nasty things to them too. Been there done that with my in-laws. \n\nAlso. Think about it, your asking a mother, and a very new mom at that, to be separated for four days from her child. No good mom would ever be okay with that. New moms are overly protective and nervous under the best of circumstances, but being separated for long periods of time is pure torture.  Add in the history of verbal and emotional abuse and the constant worry if her kid is being abused is a recipe for a meltdown, if not a nervous breakdown, from any good mom.\n\nNot to mention, you\u2019re taking your vulnerable infant child who\u2019s immune system is not fully developed yet, into a home of unvaccinated people, during a triple pandemic (RSV, Covid, influenza). Honestly I\u2019m appalled you\u2019re risking your daughter\u2019s health like this. \n\nAlso, you do realize that if you take your child without your wife\u2019s permission, as the co-parent, she could call the police and file a kidnapping charge against you, right? Just because you are the dad doesn\u2019t mean your free to override your wife\u2019s consent.", "YTA\n\nYour family has not made an effort. That's telling. Your mom bashes your wife, and you say nothing. That's even more telling. You're setting a bad example for your daughter and how people and partners should treat her. \n\nMy paternal grandmother is a drama queen. On my mom's wedding' day, she said she was losing her son and not gaining anything. She always had a bit of fakeness growing up and as I got older, I saw how she treated my mom and how my dad really did nothing. His side of the family would only be interested in talking to me or my mother when it involved something with my dad. My maternal grandparents came to see me a lot growing up, I spent time with them, and the extended family went out of the way so many times for me. Guess which side of the family I don't have a relationship with?", "YTA.. your mom has treated your wife poorly with you not defending her.\nWhy don\u2019t you invite them to your city and have them stay in a hotel so they can still meet the baby for a bit and not be an overnight thing without Jenna when she doesn\u2019t trust your mom and with good reason I might add. \n\nYou said your family hasn\u2019t even made an attempt to meet her in the 6 months she has been alive but yet, your blaming your wife for that? Have you ever even taken care of the baby by yourself for that long?", "YTA-You wouldn\u2019t stand up for your wife. Your daughter doesn\u2019t need a relationship with people who are assholes to her mother.", "YTA Jesus man sort your priorities out, your family treats your wife like shit and you are basically telling them it's fine. IF THEY DON'T RESPECT THE MOTHER THEY DO NOT GET TO PLAY HAPPY FAMILIES WITH HER CHILD. This would be my absolute hill to die on and I would totally understand if she left you over this.", "YTA. Your daughter won't remember any of this so that argument is silly. Secondly you mentioned Jenna's parents have come down multiple times but yours haven't seen her yet. They couldn't be bothered to see their grandchild??? Lastly you made no effort to compromise here or consider Jenna's feelings.", "YTA- if your wife said that you never had her back, she\u2019s got all the reasons to trust that the baby might be treated or cared for in a way that she wouldn\u2019t approve. This doesn\u2019t mean badly cared for, just not cared as if she would. I kind of understand her. \nPlus if you had an agreement during pregnancy, why breaking it?\nAs you say her family did a lot to mend, can you say the same for your family?", "YTA for claiming your wife is preventing them from meeting when it sounds like they've made no attempt to visit you. \n\nHave you even cared for/fed the baby by yourself? She's only 6 months and you don't mention how long  you plan to separate baby from her mother.", "YTA and this might just be what breaks her down and you might just return to divorce papers honestly. Hope you are okay with that just to please your precious mommy", "YWBTA and probably damaging your marriage.\n\n\nYou mentioned Jenna getting older and not letting things going over her heard. Why does she need to? Why is your mom not accountable for how she treats her?\n\nYour wife isn\u2019t comfortable with you and your baby being there\u2026.so there is mostly likely a pattern of her being treated poorly and you letting it happen.\n\nPeople who are trusted by parents don\u2019t get exclusive access to babies.\n\nMaybe try a neutral place to meet for a short time with your wife if it\u2019s something she\u2019d be comfortable with doing.", "YTA. Your wife is absolutely correct- she had put up with your mom\u2019s arseholery for 10 years. 10 years where you obviously didn\u2019t have her back or your mother would have shut up and figured out a way to coexist by now. Your wife is definitely correct. You need to figure out a way to talk to your mom and say, \u201cNow that my daughter is here, the rude comments and jerk behaviour stops. Period.\u201d \n\nAlso, a 6 month old is still pretty reliant on her mother. \n\nAlso also, I can\u2019t believe your wife has been sleeping on the couch. You\u2019re lucky it hasn\u2019t been a hotel!! If I was her, it wouldn\u2019t be the couch and it wouldn\u2019t be me. \n\nI\u2019m honestly just shocked at the ignorance here. I can\u2019t believe OP doesn\u2019t realise his behaviour and how completely messed up this situation is for his wife.", "INFO: So, do you actually stand up for your wife to your mother?\n\nEdit: Honestly, this doesn't even matter. I wouldn't want my child around an anti-vaxxer who very blatantly treated me badly either. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, you don't have you're wife's back and now you're reaping the rewards of your cowardice", "Yta if they don\u2019t respect either parent they don\u2019t get access to child", "YTA. Whatever fantasy you've concocted about how great things could be, you're likely to end up with the opposite", "INFO: why can't your family make the effort to come to you, as hers has?", "YTA\n\nYour wife is correct. If you have proven yourself incapable of protecting your wife from your family, then you aren't going to protect your daughter either.\n\nThe very fact you want to take your daughter to people who don't like *her mother, your wife* shows you would let your family do and say whatever they want to your daughter, because you would prioritise \"not rocking the boat\" over anything else.\n\nYou should be telling your extended family that your nuclear family (that's you, your wife, and your daughter) are a package deal and if they can't be kind and respectful to your wife, they won't be given the chance to mistreat your daughter the same way. \n\nTheres no such thing as \"making it fair\" when it comes to protecting your child.", "YTA \n\nYour family have made zero effort to meet your child - hers have. That\u2019s not a great sign of how important they think this is.\n\nThey treat your wife and partner of 10 years poorly. \n\nHer family have - by your admission- made an effort to repair relationships.\n\nYou then dictate what happens because it makes things easier for you? You sound like you\u2019ve not supported your wife and thought of the impact on your child at all.", "YTA your side of the family has had ample time to meet the new kid but clearly hasn't bothered. Your family is now you, your wife and your baby and you're willing to split the unit up over Christmas for the baby to meet people that aren't particularly interested in her and she won't remember anyway. I think you owe your wife an apology", "YTA - Your mom treats your wife horribly and you have done nothing about it. It is not your wife's responsibility to let the nasty things your mom says just \"go over her head\". It is your mom's responsibility to be civil to your wife - and if she won't, it is your responsibility to stand up for your wife. Your wife is protecting herself and your daughter from your mother, because she knows that you won't. \n\nYour wife is not keeping your daughter from meeting your parents. Your parents could have visited at any time in the past 6 months.", "YTA - dude... if your mom would be interested in the slightest to see your daughter, she would have flown to your place, at least once in half a year. Half a year! You can't tell me that there was no time to plan a visit or to safe up for the tickets if money is the problem. IF your mom would have wanted to be there, she would have made it possible. \n\nAnd you want to drag your infant daughter to a person who doesn't care enough about her to visit once? To a person who hates your wife and made her life so miserable? I can completely understand your wife's fears and how devastating it has to feel and how gutted she has to be that you want to put her child into that (perceived) danger she fears your mother might pose to her. Maybe the worst your mother does is to ignore the child, but for your wife you take your daughter to a horrible place. And you, who should have her back, told her you would do it no matter what and there is nothing she can do to stop you. She has to feel so desperate and powerless. You are a horrible partner!", "If what your wife says is true about you not having her back and your family not making an effort to be around the baby, then it kinda sounds like you\u2019re the AH. You\u2019re a family and you come as a pack. Not saying you should never make an effort for your family to get to know the baby, but Mom has a right to be there if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with the situation.", "YTA and your desperation for validation from a family that has no interest in you or your daughter is very sad. You owe you're wife an apology and hope she doesn't end your marriage over this.", "YTA. Your family ostracizes the person you\u2019ve chosen as a partner, the person who *carried their grandchild* and you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll take her child *against her wishes* where she isn\u2019t welcome when your family refuses to make the trip. \n\nHow on earth do you spell that out and not see where you\u2019re TA?", "YTA. She's not stopping your family from meeting your daughter. She's stopping you from taking your infant away for 4 days to go visit people who actively dislike someone who has been a part of their family for 10 years, and who she doesn't trust. \n\nIf you knew that your family meeting Averlea was important, facilitating that relationship is YOUR responsibility. You needed to start working on this 1.5 years ago. You needed to tell your mother to quit with the nasty, childish bs and stand up for your wife. You needed to make it clear that disrespecting your wife and mother of your daughter means they don't deserve access to your family. You needed to be making plans for them to visit before such a major holiday, which was always going to be more difficult. \nNot doing any of the ground work and just expecting your wife to be ok with you demanding that you take your infant daughter to go hang out in a house full of people she doesn't trust for 4 days is so thoughtless. \n\nHonestly, the very thought of that probably would've made me sick when my baby was that age.", "YTA for allowing your mother to attack your wife. Wanting to repair your relationship with your family is understandable, but introducing them to your child is not the same thing as waving a magic wand that will make them stop being horrible people. You should have a chat with your mother about burying the hatchet and tell her that you expect her to apologize to Jenna and make amends before you introduce her to your child.", "You can not be serious?! My god YTA and I can\u2019t wait to read some of the replies to this. Jesus Christ\u2026", "YTA\nJenna is right. Your mom is hostile to your wife and you don't stand up for her. Of course she's not going to trust you that you can stand up for your baby either. I don't understand why are you separated from Jenna during Christmas, why are you not traveling together and why is Averlea staying with you?\n\nYou need to set clear boundaries with your mom. If she wants a relationship with her granddaughter, she has to respect Jenna and apologize. Jenna's family is actively trying to improve the relationship, that's a huge difference. Your mom doesn't care and isn't willing to make things better.\n\nFrom the way you talk about your mother it's clear you are enabling her behaviour. You say you are low contact with your mom, yet you have million excuses why she won't change her behaviour. You made a promise to your wife when she was pregnant, doesn't matter that you thought she'll \"mellow\". \n\nContinue this way and you'll find yourself divorced.", "Ok hear me out... Has it occured to you to actually try to figure out why this is upsetting her so much?

Your wife's family can make the effort and the trip to meet your daughter. \n\nYour family apparently can't be bothered with that effort. \n\nYour wife's family don't seem to go out their way to make you uncomfortable.

YTA", "Ywbta. By all accounts it doesn\u2019t sound like your wife is unreasonable at all. Unfortunately your mother created this dynamic and now will have to live with the consequences. Just to be clear if you choose to take your daughter against your wife\u2019s wishes expect to be divorced soon. I wouldn\u2019t stay with a man that never defended me against his family and still chooses them over me during a time that should be happy. And just to be clear it\u2019s terrible separating a parent from their child over people like that.

You can't just overrule your wife's decision here and essentially threaten to do something she's clearly very uncomfortable with.\n\nThe fact that you've said it's \"unfair to your mum\" is the icing on the cake - your wife doesn't have to go about life in consideration of your mum, especially given how rude your mum seems to be.", "6 months is young to take a baby away from the mother,  especially to people who the baby is not familiar with.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nWhy don\u2019t your mom and stepdad make the effort to come and visit you and your baby instead.

Your best friend at the pub seems to agree with Jenna, which leads me to suspect that you are leaving out details that would justify her reaction.

I was pregnant with our second and he threatened to take our older child away for a few days with his side of the family - specifically his alcoholic sister-in-law and his a-hole brother who has never apologized a day in his life. I was crying hysterically, because he threatened to take our child whether I liked it or not. I wasn't invited. \n\nWe are now divorced.\n\nYTA.

Last I checked, interstates and planes travel both ways between cities. \n\nThat you decided to make an entire plan that involved separating a 6 month old from her mother is obtuse beyond all words. Especially THIS plan, that involved leaving Jenna three hours away from her baby, her baby that is going to a house where at least one person there can't stand her mother and has made that perfectly clear. \n\nHard, hard pass. If you want Averlea to meet your mom, there are other ways to do this. If your mom doesn't care enough to come all the way to see you, can she not at least drive the three hours to Jenna's parents' town and meet Averlea there?

You allow your mother to say things about Jenna and then compound that by spending holiday visits without your wife because she refuses to deal any longer with the toxicicity of your mother.  Why should Jenna be the only one to 'let it go over her head' in this situation rather than your mother apologising and learning to conduct herself like an adult?\n\nJenna rightly opts to protect her child, as a good parent should, from the possibilty of similiar treatment from someone who has already proved they are not to be trusted as they unable or unwilling to act in a positive manner toward others.  \n\nNow you compound the entire issue by issuing an ultimatum stating you will be taking your young child to see this person, period.  This road you are on will take you straight to divorce. Worse, if your child does get exposed to this kind of toxicity, not only can this hurt her but it is very likely that your ultimate relationship with her, as well, will be impacted negatively.\n\nPerhaps you should have a good long think about the situation as a whole and the potential ramifications to everyone involved.

It\u2019s not appropriate for a parent to use a child like that. \n\nYou need therapy to unpack your family issues.

She won\u2019t remember them even if they treat the baby better than they treat her mother.\n\nETA Way to leave out that on top of your mom being a spiteful AH, she\u2019s also an antivaxxer who simply isn\u2019t a safe contact for a baby even if she were the sweetest person otherwise.", "It's not that she doesn't wanna meet up with your family.

WTF dude are you insane?\n\nIf you love your wife and your daughter, you need your family to proof they are capable of being around your baby while respecting you, your wife and your boundaries. \n\nMaybe your wife would be fine with them visiting a few times and showing, that they are able to change and then you can visit them together later.

TLDR at the bottom. My wife Jenna (28F) and I (32M) had our daughter Averlea 6 months ago. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years and married for 3. \n\nWe both live out of state from our families and neither of us have the best relationship with them, though Jenna\u2019s family have made a lot of effort to come and visit, mend bridges, and interact with Averlea since she was born. My family (mom 52F, stepdad 55M, 3 younger brothers 17-21M) live an extra few hours away and are yet to meet her.  It\u2019s important to note that my mom and Jenna do NOT get along. Mom has always had something to say about Jenna and the older Jenna\u2019s gotten and the longer it\u2019s gone on the less Jenna has been willing to let it go over her head. This has resulted in us spending the last 10 years doing separate holiday visits.\n\nMy plan this year was to drop Jenna at her parents place safely after the flight and then carry on the extra 3 hour drive with Averlea to mine, and then pick her up on December 23rd so we could spend Christmas Day as a family. Jenna\u2019s response was simply \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nIn our house, no is usually a complete sentence, but I asked her why and her response was \u201cwe talked about this when I was pregnant. You never had my back with your mom so I don\u2019t trust you to advocate for Averlea, and since she\u2019s made no effort to be around her, I\u2019m not comfortable with letting you take our baby into that environment without me, and I am not going to go somewhere it\u2019s evident I\u2019m not wanted\u201d \n\nI brought up the fact that I want my daughter to know my step/parents and her side of the family and that Jenna was stopping that from happening, and how unfair it was to my mom given that her parents have been here atleast twice a month since she\u2019s been born and have been able to have that bonding time. \n\nI told her I would drop her off and take Averlea anyway, or me and Averlea would fly in to my parents home airport, but one way or another she would be meeting them this Christmas. That is when Jenna just cracked and broke. She started BAWLING and repeating how she \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d put her in that position\u201d and when I told this story to my best friend at the pub, even he raised his eyebrow and said that it wasn\u2019t a good move. Jenna has been sleeping on the couch and I\u2019m beginning to feel awful and second guess everything. \n\nWIBTA or am I right in standing my ground here? \n\nTLDR - Wife doesn\u2019t want our daughter to meet my family.

I'm surprised she is still with you. Do you know how people speak about men who continue to choose mommy after they're married/have children? Have you ever thought to contemplate the reasons for such widely held opinions?\n\nAnother cut and dry example is your wife's family making the effort to make amends and visit several times over the past 6 months. Your parents haven't done jack. They continue to abuse your wife and they choose not to meet their granddaughter. Your parent's behavior screams that they don't care about their abusive and cruel behavior. \n\nThe fact that you think your parents will overlook 50% of your child's DNA and child's mother shows that you refuse to recognize unrepentant AHs and you will allow them to abuse your innocent child.\n\nYes, you will allow it.

Don\u2019t go to theirs for Christmas and instead learn to grow some balls and a spine and stick up for the person you chose to love unconditionally and spend the rest of your life with.

I don't think he's considered the amount of damage he's opening himself and his child up to", "YTA for all the comments above. OP's lack of a spine is very apparent. How can he be with someone so long but not defend them? I hope this is a wake up call because things will go south very very fast otherwise.", "This.\n\nThey have had 6 months to drive or hop on a plane to come meet their grand child. They have made the choice not to do so. Why does your wife have to be the one to make a sacrifice here if your parents are not willing to do the bare minimum.\n\nAnd, now OP wants to pull his 6 month old daughter away from his wife for what sounds like several days to please his Mom? \n\nDoes the baby nurse? Because if the baby nurses to sleep you are going to make this a nightmare for both your wife and your child. Has the baby ever been away from Mom overnight?\n\nDude, you are selfish. Why Christmas? Why not wait until the spring to discuss this? Maybe then you, your wife and child can fly to visit your parents, the three of you can stay in a hotel and you can take the baby over to visit for a few hours each day. At least that way your wife doesn't have to worry that the baby isn't being cared for.\n\nI really question your integrity dude. You seem to absolutely lack integrity if you are willing to break this very simple promise to your wife, again put her in a position where she is harmed by your family.", "Nicely stated!", "Yeah, this got me, too.\n\nOP, it is NOT unfair to your Mom that your MIL has seen the baby and your Mom has not. Your MIL has chosen to see the baby. Your Mom has made the choice many times over NOT to see your child. \n\nNo one is stopping your Mom from getting in the car or on a plane and coming to visit you guys at home. My guess is Jenna would be FAR more comfortable with an arrangement like that where you could take the baby to visit your Mom at the hotel for a couple of hours or Jenna could go out and get some alone time while your Mom came over to visit.\n\nI can guarantee if your Mom wanted a relationship with your child, she would be moving heaven and earth to meet the baby. It is simply not that important to her. Instead of making Jenna sacrifice time with her own child, pick up the phone and call your Mom. Tell her that you would like her to come visit. Give her two weekends and tell her that you will pay for a hotel for 2 nights whichever weekend she wants to come. That is facilitating a visit. Tell Mom that you will bring the baby to the hotel to meet her each day for 4-5 hours, take the baby home to your wife and then you and your mom will go out to dinner.\n\nBut, ditching out on your wife is a REALLY bad decision and quite frankly it is mean spirited. Its also unfair to your child.", "My kids are 3 and 5, both got covid, and both got pneumonia. My 5 year old was right at septic thanks to a strep infection that hit at the same time.

He was a sick boy. \n\nTheir pediatrician said that this variant is causing pneumonia in a lot of the kids she sees. She said prior to this year she had never seen this pneumonia ever. \n\nOp is nuts to take a 6 month old that far out,  sans the kids mama, and to a house of anti vaxxers.

He went out and just talked to her. They left but that's not the reason we're NC now. She's an active drug user and I don't want my kids around that.

They weren't and never have.", "Especially since the baby is 6 months old.

Your parents are the ones creating a barrier and forcing you to choose between them and your wife. Stand up for your wife and tell your parents that until they can treat her with dignity and respect, they will not be having a relationship with any of you. Do you even like your wife? You aren\u2019t acting like it.", "That was my response too. Asshole from the get go with the username to diminish the significance of his wife's opinion.

So in response you pretty much told her that her thoughts and feelings weren't important, that her options are to let her child go to a place that not even she feels comfortable in without her or if she wants to prevent your daughter from being in a hostile environment she has to tag along and spend her holiday in a toxic household that she doesn't feel safe in... Am I getting that right?\nYour family hasn't put in any effort to fix the relationships from what I'm seeing, at least her family is trying.\nYou sound like a major AH right now! You disregarded her valid concerns and feelings! It sounds like you don't have your wifes back and maybe you guys should get counseling.", "He\u2019s doing it for his mother, not his child.", "Honestly I\u2019m wondering if OP\u2019s in-laws were in the right and made amends w OP anyways\u2026.", "I hope you and your children are in a much better place now without him!", "Yeah. For this reason alone, YTA. A 6 month old can\u2019t handle this. \nAs a married couple, you also can\u2019t do ultimatums with each other or make decisions about your kid over each others head. You don\u2019t get to decide that you are taking the baby anyway against mom\u2019s wishes. That\u2019s not how to be a good parent or husband. That\u2019s why she\u2019s melting down, not because of the mean MIL. \n\nThe MIL being hostile and antivax are major issues which might make it actually unsafe to be there. Taking a step back, I bet you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable putting baby in that unsafe situation with anyone else, but we feel SO MUCH pressure to cave when it comes to our parents. I get it - my dad is antivax too (but he is really kind to me and my spouse so there\u2019s not the added emotional conflict going on). \n\nIf you REALLY want to have your parents meet your baby (it\u2019s a natural feeling), make a compromise. You simply can\u2019t bring baby for multiple days without mom (this is obvious, if they get mad at this point, they are gaslighting you). But while you\u2019re relatively nearby, THEY can drive 3 hours to hang out for the day (or stay at a hotel for a few days). Unvaccinated, they shouldn\u2019t stay with you, and you should try to hang out in well ventilated places, preferably with masks. By going to a park, zoo, or restaurant, this should come naturally by now so it shouldn\u2019t be a cause for drama. \nPreferably, Jenna should be there as well to keep an eye on baby. Never take a baby away from a new mom when mom doesn\u2019t feel safe- it\u2019s pure animal instinct and will always turn out badly.  Tell MIL that this is her chance to make amends because now that baby is here, you won\u2019t be doing two Christmases anymore (or whatever you already agreed on with your wife). Jenna will always be around with your daughter and you won\u2019t be making exceptions for Christmas. You have to have your wife\u2019s back - the ways MIL makes her feel are valid. Your loyalty is to your wife, that\u2019s what marriage is.", "Thank you! Though at least its not Averleigh", "He wants to arrive carrying the child like a conquering hero and lay the prize baby at their feet. Maybe they will now respect and care for him since he's produced offspring. It's disgusting that he's being so controlling and taking the baby without her consent.

I don't ever remember meeting my dad's mother until my dad decided on my 7th birthday after celebrating with my moms family he was gonna take my sisters and I and drag us 3 hours away to meet his mom, his aunt and his and older brothers, the experience was fun I guess, my moms side of the family made sure we had snacks and new coloring books I was gifted so we'd be entertained, and looking back I can only see that as one thing, my dad hijacking my birthday as an excuse to take us to see some of our family who only one of which his oldest brother had decided contact with us was something worth having, the only reason any of us agreed to go was to see his older brother and meet my grandma, genuinely I think at the time Ithought I was going to get more presents because it was my birthday but I got a moon pie and that was nice, in the end though all we'd accomplished was meeting people who up until they died visited us maybe two or three times in a decade, all off whom until the last 3 or 4 years could drive, stay up way psst our bed time so we'd be tired at school the next day, and get me majorly ignored by straingers who claimed to love me on my own birthday and that's exactly what's going to happen to ops daughter, if his family is anything like my dad's, who were for the most part very kind, they won't care about having anything to do with his daughter after she stops being a baby even sooner in this case.
