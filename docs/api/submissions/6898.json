He then started coming north for me, and I knew he would crush me with his continental bonus.\n\nSarah and another friend both started in Europe, and they were fighting for a foothold there, so both had weak positions. I thought I stood a better chance in Europe, so I entered the fray. My next turn, I realized Sarah's territories outside Europe were conquered, and I had just enough soldiers to potentially eliminate her and get her cards, which would give me an advantage over my other friend in Europe. To do this I would have to attack only Sarah, and I did and I eliminated her.\n\nSarah was upset when she handed me her cards and asked why I targeted her. I explained the strategy of eliminating someone to get their cards to get an advantage. She said that wasn't fair, because she didn't stand a chance if someone decided to attack only her. I defended myself by saying the only way to play the game is to attack the territories of others. She said \"well have fun without me then,\" and then went and sat on her couch with her phone and didn't engage in conversation with us until the game was over.\n\nMy friend is mad at me for making a bad first impression and hurting her feelings the first time she met everyone.

I would have eliminated my own mother if she had the weakest position on the board. It's a game.", "NTA\n\nSo you're supposed to throw the game as a group because she just met you guys? What is she, 10?\n\nUnless you're under the age of 8, board games are no longer rigged, and everyone is playing to win. It's the whole point. If you haven't learned that yet, you're just being a sore loser. And if you can't handle it, then don't play. She's the problem\n\nEdit: AND i would reconsider her as a GF. She is clearly immature, and had no problem throwing a tantrum the first time SHE met HIS FRIENDS. What's it gonna be like when she's actually comfortable? Lol", "NTA, that's a valid strategy. Now, if this had been happening over multiple games and you'd have singled her out, the situation would be completely different. But since this was only one game it's just bad luck on her side, I guess. It happens.", "Soft YTA. This was supposed to be a fun game for you to get to know her. Fun low stakes gameplay, with conversation. You couldn\u2019t go easy for one game? Defeating her like that defeated the entire point of your friend bringing Sarah over. What\u2019s she even supposed to do after she\u2019s lost that quickly, join the game related conversation that she has no way to contribute to?\n\nPlus if everyone was targeting her, it can come of as bullying the new person. I\u2019m not saying you were, but it can leave a very bad impression with someone when that happens to them.", "NAH, but I feel like OP is a bit more \"guilty\" than the consensus so far.  \n\nI think OP went into the game with different expectations than the rest of the table. It sounds like the rest of the group wanted a fun, casual game where OP played to win. Neither approach is fundamentally wrong, but the two play styles came to a clash. And when it's your first time meeting a bunch of people and are stressing out about making a good first impression, it's understandable getting targeted and eliminated early can really put you on the defensive.\n\nNow I'm charging OP a tiiiiny be more because he's the one who didn't read the room properly it seems, but the really issue is that Risk wasn't the right pick for the situation. Party games, cooperative games, even competitive games that are much more lighthearted and with no early elimination (e.g. Smash Up) would have avoided that problem entirely.\n\nAgain, not flat out blaming OP because he didn't do anything wrong, I just have a hard time to call Sarah a sore loser or blame her when it was her first time in that social circle and was probably more focusing on being of pleasant company and getting to know everyone.", "NTA, but to be honest, this is a problem with the game Risk, since it generally rewards ganging up on a player and pretty much whatever you do you're ganging up on someone somehow.", "NTA. you were playing a strategy game and your strategy eliminated her. It sucks to lose and it sucks to lose so early in the game.", "Since it was the first time meeting her and you eliminated her so swiftly I can see where she took it that you really didn't want her involved in the game at all and intentionally took HER out first. It sounds like you just went after the person with the weakest position, she took it as a personal affront.\n\nNta", "Mmm-soft YTA. She\u2019s never played before and you took advantage. That was not exactly sportsmanlike. I\u2019m guessing this is the last game night you will have with your friend as long as they are together. \n\nEstablished groups tend to unintentionally freeze out newcomers by talking about people/hobbies/memories they have no knowledge of-and watching others play risk is as boring as watching others play video games.", "NTA because you were playing the game as intended. However politeness would be not to play aggressively with new folks if it\u2019s a casual game.  As others have said this is why risk (and monopoly) sucks- player elimination always makes the first one out miserable.  \n\n\nFor future occasions just buy better games. Catan is a great alternative to monopoly as it has card trading and claiming spaces to take over the board.  My personal favorite casual games for non serious gamers are Ticket to Ride and Splendor.  Ticket to ride plays fast, has a map where you compete by blocking one another but no one gets eliminated and with partial hidden scores you never feel like you can\u2019t win.  Splendor is an economic game where you pick up chips and build a little gem empire and race to 15 points.  Both are tighter than something like risk and have defined end games that don\u2019t drag out forever the way a risk or monopoly game can (everyone has abandoned one of those games due to exhaustion)", "ESH. It's just a game, let people stay engaged and keep playing, it makes for a better evening (especially if they're people you don't know well and just casual gamers).\n\nAlso, it's just a game. Don't get bent out of shape if you get eliminated, display some grace when you lose.", "NTA. It's a game. She lost. Shit happens. Get over it and wait for the next game, girl.", "If you can't take the heat, don't play the game. NTA.", "NTA no one makes friends with monopoly or risk.", "NTA\n\nShe played a game where the goal is to win by beating the others and thus for targeting them.\n\nYou just played the game.\n\nShe seems like one of those people who like to make up rules that make games more *fair* although those rules don't exist and often are completely against the goal of the game.\n\nIt would be different if you played Pacheesi and you singled her out and used your figures to hunt solely hers and kick them out instead ever trying to kick out others. That would have been an AH move.\n\nShe's a sore looser, let it go. There's no help if you meet one of those.", "Nta.. tears don't stop wars... btw who won?", "ESH for playing such an ancient board game when you have a new person over.\n\nModern board games do not require a loser to sit it out for hours. The game should be almost over when you can see who is the winner and who is the loser. Risk is fun when you are in it, but it is terrible as a social activity.", "NTA its a game\u2026 she should get over it or learn to play better \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA she's a sore loser and that game is fun, she's not.", "NTA  \nUm... If she can not play this game with yall she shouldnt play board games period with yall. even my partners are not free from my wrath in board games", "NTA, if everyone was supposed to go easy on the new girl, they didn't fill you in. Also that's no fun anyways, Risk is meant to be a brutal war zone for friends/family to enjoy!", "She needs a better strategy for Risk.\n\nMy personal favorite is taking Australia... Either by starting there... By force early in the game... \n\nOr waiting until everyone is drunk and exchanging everyone else's pieces for mine and the proclaiming \"at least I have Australia!\" several turns later.\n\nUnless it's 2210 AD. Then I hope no one notices until the next round. \n\nAnd no. You weren't the asshole. It just sucks to lose when first time you meet new people\n\nNta", "NTA you played the game. I'm a sore loser too so I get where she's coming from, but it's not your fault that she can't handle it.", "NTA - This was a valid strategy to win a game.
