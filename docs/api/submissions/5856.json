Will has always been into video games, Star Wars and anime etc. It\u2019s never been my cup of tea but I think it\u2019s healthy that we have separate hobbies and interests and we have other stuff in common. \n\nWhen we had Adam Will was super excited to share his interests with him and bought him Star Wars themed babygrows and toys etc. For Adam\u2019s first Halloween Will dressed him up as Darth Vader and it was super cute. It was the same for the girls. I did tell Will that I had no issue with this while the kids were small but we had to let them develop their own interests. As it turns out both Adam and Maddie love playing computer games with their dad and have similar interests so there have been no issues. \n\nThe problem now is that as Megan is getting older she is showing more interest in princesses and barbies etc and finds her dad and siblings\u2019 interests boring. Will seems to have an issue with this and keeps trying to encourage Megan more towards his interests. At Halloween he seemed annoyed that Megan wanted to dress as Elsa as he always took pride in Maddie not dressing up as a princess like lots of her classmates. \n\nThis Christmas it has come to a head as Will spent all of Boxing Day playing the switch with Adam and Maddie and helping them build Lego while leaving Megan out. Will has offered Megan to play with them but she wants to play with her new toys and the games that she likes. I played with Megan most of the day but she asked if she could play her new barbie game on the switch for a while with her dad. I told them all to let her have a turn and play the barbie game with Megan. Adam and Maddie were actually fine and seemed to have fun but Will kept making fun of the game and telling Megan that other games like Mario kart were far more fun.\n\nI could see Megan losing confidence in wanting to play the game and she started to say she didn\u2019t want to play anymore so I pulled Will aside and told him off and said that while he was a great dad to Adam and Maddie he was being a bad dad to Megan by ignoring her interests. Will was really, really hurt by being called a bad dad and has been quiet ever since. The kids are now starting to notice that their dad is upset. I\u2019m now wondering if I was too harsh as he is generally a good dad and I do know that he loves Megan as much as he loves Adam and Maddie.", "created_utc": 1672238573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxb94g/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_is_a_bad_dad_to/", "score": 272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Pressuring or forcing your children to have your same interests is not OK. It prevents them from developing their own identity, and can hinder their self esteem and confidence in the long run. It's really important to let them be them, and support them regardless. Also, leaving them out and ignoring them or putting other siblings on a pedestal is very wrong. They should be treated as equally as humanly possible. Your husband was being a bad dad to your daughter. Was it harsh to say that and call it out? Yes.

This can permanently affect their relationship and it can transfer over to Adam and Maddie and they can grow to also bully Megan or they can grow to exclude her. \n- Your husband is trying to force his interest on the kids and it was cute for awhile but now it\u2019s just damaging. He\u2019s causing his daughter to lose confidence when she makes attempts to bond with him. \n- Your husband goes out of his way to bash Megans interests, and basically shames her for being \u201cgirly\u201d instead of a quirky gamer child like him and the two older children. \n- If he truly loved megan as much as the older kids, why isn\u2019t he trying to bond with her in the way SHE likes? It\u2019s not gonna kill him, he\u2019s not gonna lose his man card or Star Wars / Gamer card. Why does he feel the need to make mean spirited comments about the things she likes rather than encourage her to be herself and find her own interests? \n\nNTA but your husband really needs to pull his head out of his rear and realize how his treatment is affecting Megan, and he needs to realize that the way he treats her can cause her to become and feel like the black sheep.", "NTA you spoke the truth, better him being upset as a grown man then having your child who is still developing their own identity having their interests belittled by the man who\u2019s opinion matters most to them.

Will has to accept that your children are individuals with different interests but that doesn't mean he gets to treat them differently. Excluding Megan and making fun of her likes is where he crossed the line, and you had to call him out on it. Hopefully, he will listen and learn.

Your husband is leaving out one of his kids.", "NTA. While I'm a big proponent of letting kids be into things that aren't \"typical\" for them (like little boys playing with dolls or little girls playing with trucks), there is also absolutely nothing wrong with kids liking the \"stereotypical\" interests for them. What's wrong with Megan liking princesses and Barbies? Barbie literally gets to do every profession out there, she was made to empower little girls.\n\nYour husband doesn't have to share her interests, but he needs to put the effort in the same as he does for the other kids.

You as a parent are the most important advocate for your child. Your husband clearly was being a bully to your kid. What happens next is one of two things. Your husband either corrects his behavior & stays connected with both children equally. OR he turns into a parent that favors a child over another.

I deeply respect you for being able to immediately call your husband out for mistreating your kids. You refused to enable his behavior when you saw how it affected your daughter, and that makes you a thoughtful parent. If some of the parents I know had ever done this to their partners, a lot of my adult friends wouldn't be as traumatized as they are now. Seriously, good on you. It's also really difficult to call people out on bad behaviors when they're generally really good. That can be hard for both parties.

He's being incredibly selfish. He can be hurt all he likes, you didn't say anything that wasn't correct. This is his to fix.\n\nThe good news is it's fixable. He just needs to do better, and likely apologize to Megan. And stop moping around the other kids, bringing them into it will likely make things worse for Megan if they turn on her because she \"hurt\" their dad. They're too young to see this situation as a whole.", "NTA\n\nHe IS being a bad dad to his one daughter. It SHOULD hurt to hear that. Hopefully this will serve as a wake up call that will help him to establish a healthy relationship with all 3 of his children.

Now, she is into a lot of the same geeky things we are, but she\u2019s also into math which is something her father and I suck at. But we still get her math things, watch videos about math, and play math games with her. \n\nNo child is here to fill something within us, your kiddos don\u2019t have a job to be your husbands sidekicks or fulfil needs he didn\u2019t get met as a child. He should be just as excited to play Barbie as he is Mario Kart as that is what his kid likes, and wants to share with him.\n\nI 100% know my parents hated my nerdy info dumping  as a child, but they still listened and smiled, and asked questions. As they may not have gotten why I found joy in something, but they wanted me to be happy. And talking for 6 hours straight in the car about Star Wars Old Republic democracy was a small price to pay. And while they weren\u2019t perfect I tended to still go to them with things as a teenager my friends would not talk to their parents about. I knew they loved me, and they actually liked me as a person too. \n\nYour husband is failing to show that he actually likes his kids for who they are, not who he wants them to be.

It's good that he's upset, as hopefully it means he will be open to a discussion about why he thinks it is OK to bully his own daughter for having interests different than his own.

Kids pick up on these things and it can have lasting impact, from personal experience. Hopefully he takes it to heart and starts learning how to share interests with your youngest now.", "NTA, he needs to respect all his kid's interests. Did his dad like sports and ever diminish his interests? He's doing that exact same thing to his kids, but instead of sports it's Star Wars.

He's being a bad father to all three. He's teaching Adam and Maddie to teach Megan differently and to bully. They'll learn it through his actions. \n\nFor what it's worth - Disney now has the Star Wars franchise and so Princess Leia is now a Disney Princess.", "He's NOT \"generally a good dad\" if he's already been reminded not to show favoritism and it's still happening. Good on you for standing up for the youngest. NTA", "NTA -- Does it hurt feelings to find out you are dropping the ball as a parent? God yes! The absolute shittiest feeling in my opinion. Stewing in hurt feelings over your failings doesn't fix it though. As a parent, this should be something he immediately begins course correcting, because he cares about not hurting his children. Instead he is being a bad dad to all his kids and a bad partner by giving everyone the silent treatment.  \n\n\nIt is one thing to need time and space to process something. It is another to shut down and withdraw, that simply is not a luxury parents can indulge in, not over something so simple as \"hey, quit ignoring and shaming your kid's interests\".   \n\n\nYou say he is a really great dad, but is he a great dad even when things aren't going his way or things he likes? See, an actual great parent doesn't shut out the aspects of their kids that don't fit their fandom/hobby. An actual great parent is invested in the CHILD with the interests of the child being secondary to actually valuing the child. They are nurturing the child with the child's interests being nurtured in the process. Not great parents value the child having the same interests as them, with the interests being primary and the child being secondary. They nurture their interests and the child is nurtured so long as they are attached to the interest.   \n\n\nYour husband sounds like the second one.", "NTA. \n\nYour husband\u2019s rhetoric is rooted in misogyny. I\u2019m into some pretty nerdy fandoms, and this is so pervasive in those communities. Women can\u2019t win. If they like the nerdy stuff, like Maddie, they spend their lives defending their interests and knowledge from gatekeeping jerks. If they are interested in more traditionally feminine things, they\u2019re ridiculed for being \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cjust like other girls\u201d, whatever the hell that means. Your husband needs to grow up and stop picking on your youngest before he gives her a complex about it, or gives your son the impression that\u2019s appropriate.", "YTA. He may be struggling connecting with his child but in no sense does he sound like a bad dad. You took one thing and made him feel extremely guilty for it. How would you feel if he said you were a bad mom cause you don't play games with your two older kids?", "ESH. He was being a shitty dad but you probably could\u2019ve been more diplomatic.", "Eh, you didn't have to call him a \"bad dad\". He doesn't know how to connect with her and while I think realizing he was isolating her a bit, or putting her interests down should have been obvious to him - he obviously cares. No parent is perfect - and a bad parent/dad is moreso one that doesn't give a shit in my opinion- or doesn't change when things are pointed out. \n\nIf this was the first time you ever mentioned it to him, it does seem a bit harsh and it could have been worded differently. Like \"hey, you have such a good relationship with those 2, but Megan has different interests now and I can see how your words and actions are affecting her. Maybe try to encourage her interests just as much and use them to bond with her over them a little better.\" Hearing that, he might have felt bad for not realizing it but it might have sparked a change. That's what a good parent would do. Seemed you didn't give him the opportunity to do that before saying he was \"bad\". \n\nI think it's good you said something as he likely didn't notice, or maybe didn't realize how much it was affecting her. Maybe he thought he was being playful. While lots of Dad's naturally get jnto the princess stuff on their own and don't discourage it, or put them down for it - maybe he just needed a push/reminder and despite the harsh words -he got it.", "ESH, he's not a bad dad, he's just not a good one to her.  your reasoning is sound and he did need to be called out.  Calling him a bad dad went too far though.", "YTA. That was too harsh. Would you tell your kids that they're bad people? You could have just pointed out that Megan has different interests and he needs to accept it and adjust.", "Kinda the asshole? He definitely needs to support his daughters interests, but it\u2019s not hard to understand why it could be a struggle for a dad to watch his daughter grow apart from the things they used to enjoy together\u2026and him struggling with this doesn\u2019t make him a bad dad. Humans are PEOPLE and people are flawed. So you should definitely be having this conversation with him and even \u201ccalling him out\u201d for not supporting his kid properly, but calling him a bad dad when he very clearly isn\u2019t, was a touch too far. However, that \u201chumans are people and people are flawed\u201d thing applies to you, too. It doesn\u2019t make you a bad partner. Y\u2019all will figure it out.. video game dads generally love their kids, even if they need a little guidance from time to time.", "YTA - he is just trying to get kids to be like him and teach them about his interests. Why should adults be forced to allow kids develop their own interests when the adult already has a set of interests which he can impart on the little ones", "NTA but the solution isn't for him to pretend to love Barbies (although he should quit mocking it) but find something they both enjoy.", "The sad part is that Adam and Maddie *will* pick up on it and will mirror him to a certain point. They follow his and OPs example, and the example he\u2019s setting is that it\u2019s perfectly okay to bully and exclude  Megan because she doesn\u2019t fit in with them. \n\nOOPs husband is Regina Georging his two kids.", "NTA. As the kid who was always excluded for her girly interests please protect you daughter from being ashamed to like the stuff she likes", "This. He is not just a bad parent tonone of his kids. That behavoiur is bad for both of them, just worse for Megan.", "Not to mention a misogynist who hates \"girly\" things and excludes one child because of that. Will is a fucking asshole.", "This is mostly common in millennial parents. I always feel so sad when I see those posts from kids who\u2019s parents named them all Harry Potter or Star Wars names and they aren\u2019t allowed their own interests. 40 years ago, that was considered abuse", "Thank you for this. Dad needs to sit with his feelings for a while.", "I'm glad the OP spoke up. This child is five years old and this needs nipped in the bud now before she starts to notice her father doesn't like her as much as her siblings.", "Agree with this. NTA, your husband is likely quiet and upset because he realizes that he hasn\u2019t been the best dad to Megan. That doesn\u2019t mean that he is overall not a good father or that he can\u2019t improve his relationship and behavior with her now. A further discussion about this with him is definitely in order.", "Adding to that, Megan and Maddie are very close in age. I have a similar gap with my older sister and I can remember being young and wanting to explore/develop/express my own interests and be recognized as an individual not as a 2.0 version of my sister. I wasn\u2019t able to participate in a lot of things because 'it wouldn't be fair' to let me enroll in something that my sister doesn't want to do because then I'd be getting something she doesn't.\n\nMy parents believed that they were giving out fair and equal treatment, but in practice they just regarded us as interchangeable until one of us cemented the favorite child status. Obviously this went to my sister, and belittling others (or maybe just me) for having interests that don't match her tastes is basically her entire personality.\n\nAll this trauma dumping to say OPs husband is doing a major disservice to all of the children and I wish my mom had been more like OP.", "NTA. You maybe could have phrased it better but your point is valid,", "I was thinking exactly this but couldn't figure out how to word it. I find it so weird when parents are so proud of their daughters for not being \"girly\", there's nothing wrong with liking princesses or pink or dresses. Learn to accept your kids as they are\n\nIt's also not great for the other kids because it shows that his attention is entirely conditional, he'll start ignoring them and insulting their interests if they start having interests he doesn't share (especially the other daughter, it seems).", "I thought this same thought. Gamer men and misogyny *can* go hand in hand- I immediately thought of the pandemic and how a lot of girls were trying to connect with husbands and boyfriends over playing games but they were mocked for the games being too \"easy\", \"silly\", and \"girly\". Things like Stardew Valley, Disney Dreamlight, Animal Crossing, Sims, etc. And how it started conversations about misogyny in gaming all over again. \n\nVideo games are video games and the elitist attitide this dad has can only serve to hurt her in the long run. He seems to take pride in his youngest daughter being \"not like the other girls\" and was *upset* that his other daughter wanted to dress as a princess??", "Yep thinking there is something wrong or lesser with liking the feminine princesses and dressing up as one is just good old misogyny. \n\nWe as a society need to stop saying there's something wrong with liking princesses and start saying stop reproducing with people who denigrate what toys a kid likes.", "He sounds like a 10 year old picking on his younger sister. He is misogynistic and immature trying to bully the \"girly\" away from his own daughter. NTA. \n\nThe best way to bond with your children is refusing to partake in any activity they like and telling them that their interests suck /s", "Even if they genuinely do enjoy them now, what if they don't in a few years? What if Maddie wants to try some of the \"girlier\" things (or even worse, dare to dress as a princess for Halloween?) They're going to get ignored as much as Megan is now", "He WAS being a bad dad.", "He\u2019s actively making fun of a 6 year old\u2019s game and interest\u2026 that isn\u2019t just not playing with her. He actively doesn\u2019t like her interests and discourages them.", "How do you think his daughter feels??  Yes he may struggle to connect with her but he should attempt.  He only attempts with things that interest him.\n\nHe may not be a bad dad but he is neglectful to her.", "This seems to be a constant thing with dad being annoyed that the youngest doesn\u2019t like what he does. How do you play a game a 5 year old wanted to play and then make fun of it the whole time to the kids face. Or being disappointed and all upset that his kid wanted to be a princess for Halloween and not a star wars character. Please explain to me how that is being a good dad?", "But it wasn\u2019t ONE thing. Maddie decided she was into girlier things and will her dad is tarring it down. That does in fact make him a bad dad towards her. the mom isn\u2019t ignoring her older children\u2019s interests she encourages them to spend time doing what they want to. In this case it\u2019s spending time playing video games with dad. I have two so I get not being inherently interested in their intrest but you should at least shut up long enough to play a game with your child.", "Lol I guess constantly shit talking on your daughter's interest TO HER FACE isn't being a bad dad. It's bad enough she's always left out, but did he really have to voice his disapproval on the things she likes? I'd rather not have a dad than have him for a dad.", "Dad was actively bullying his kid by making her feel like her interests weren\u2019t important and that he wouldn\u2019t play unless it was something he liked.", "Considering he was basically shit talking on his daughter's interest TO HER FACE I don't think there was anything wrong with calling him a bad dad since no good dad would be bullying their daughter for having their own interest.\n\nI don't know if you've ever been in Megan's shoes but fathers like him cause tremendous insecurities. You have no idea how it feels to not only be left out but be bullied for being yourself BY YOUR OWN FATHER.", "If he's, from your own words, \"not a good dad\" to Megan, that would, by default, make him a bad dad. He's a father to all of the kids. So he's either good to all, or a bad dad entirely. That's how parenting works", "The fact that he\u2019s making fun of his own child and treating her differently makes him a bad dad despite how he is with the other kids", "He\u2019s not being a good dad to Adam and Maddie either, children learn by example. And the example husband is showing them is that it\u2019s perfectly okay to bully and exclude Megan for simply having different interests than them. This can cause long lasting damage if it isn\u2019t corrected now.", "Damn. If only there was a word to describe \u201cnot good\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t too harsh. He is a bad dad to Megan and forcing his interests to her instead of listening to what she want\u2019s to do and what her own interests are and then he even makes fun of her in front of his other kids? How is that a good dad? NTA", "Wtfuck ? I found Will.", "40 years ago beating your kid with a belt wasn't considered abuse tho so like it's not all bad", "NTA but you would be if you don\u2019t realize your husband is a misogynist and it\u2019s been affecting your kids from the start", "By playing games like Sims, Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley, does it make men less \"manly\"? Hell no!!!\n\nI admit I like to play more \"manly\" games like shooters, but if my GF came and told me she wanted to play a videogame with me, I would go all in for it, even if it wasnt of my liking, I would play and tell her that it isnt for me, yet, would love to find an option for a game that we both would like.\n\nOP\u00b4s husband isnt a father, just \"one of the guys\", literally trying to have play buddies more that kids, not taking the responsability that one needs to have with children.\n\nFor example, if I was a father, I would take interest in the things that my kds love, even if I dont understand, try to see what they like and try to find a way to connect, in fact, I even do it know with my GF\u00b4s nephews who I try to connect more that what I see their parents or other aunts do, like seeing and learning about instruments with one, to the point we imitate the sounds, even if Im not a huge fan of music or being social even, but take the effort to have a bond with them.", "[removed]", "Or not be upset they chose to be a princess for Halloween.", "More flies with honey, especially when it\u2019s your family. I am sure the father didn\u2019t realize he was making his daughter feel bad. Even if he did, chastising someone with harsh language isn\u2019t likely to generate a favorable outcome.", "Ignored one of three unless she does what he wants and then criticizing her interests.", "This exactly. My husband doesn\u2019t like wearing sparkly dresses or makeup or any of that. Man\u2019s knows zero about ANY of that but he damn well does his best to put on eyeshadow because his daughter smiling takes over the embressment he might feel with bright 90\u2019s blue eyeshadow on him or a big huge sparkly bow attached to him.", "He is fucking old enough to know not to bully a 6y.o. better yet his own daughter. Don't have children if you're gonna act like a big bully when they have different interests. If the harsh language youre talking about is being labeled as a bad dad, it is not harsh because that it the truth. What parent would bully their child for liking barbie and what kind of parent sets that kind of example to their other kids that it's okay to bully those with different interest than you??", "Oh, of course, he didn't REALIZE that mocking someone else's interests would make them feel bad, so it's no big deal. Boohoo, he's a grown-up who should be more than capable of taking some time to reflect on his behavior, if he feels bad for a little bit, sucks to suck. He can now consider that this is EXACTLY how he made his 6-year-old feel.", "So he gets a pass for causing their 6yo daughter to have Big Sads by mocking her interests but the wife doesn't get a pass for causing her grown husband to have Big Sads by calling out how much of an asshole it is to mock a 6yo?", "Exactly it\u2019s not hard to attempt to connect with a child with different interests.  She likes Barbie\u2019s play with the Barbie\u2019s with her.  That would mean the world to her.\n\nAlso your husband sounds like a great dad.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re mature enough to participate in this conversation.", "That's okay. At least I'm mature enough to not bully a 6y.o. for liking Barbie."]}
