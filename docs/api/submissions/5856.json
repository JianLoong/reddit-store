{"id": 5856, "submission_id": "zxb94g", "title": "AITA for telling my husband he is a bad dad to one of our kids", "selftext": "Me (F36) and my husband Will (M35) have three kids Adam (M9), Maddie (F7) and Megan (F6). Will has always been into video games, Star Wars and anime etc. It\u2019s never been my cup of tea but I think it\u2019s healthy that we have separate hobbies and interests and we have other stuff in common. \n\nWhen we had Adam Will was super excited to share his interests with him and bought him Star Wars themed babygrows and toys etc. For Adam\u2019s first Halloween Will dressed him up as Darth Vader and it was super cute. It was the same for the girls. I did tell Will that I had no issue with this while the kids were small but we had to let them develop their own interests. As it turns out both Adam and Maddie love playing computer games with their dad and have similar interests so there have been no issues. \n\nThe problem now is that as Megan is getting older she is showing more interest in princesses and barbies etc and finds her dad and siblings\u2019 interests boring. Will seems to have an issue with this and keeps trying to encourage Megan more towards his interests. At Halloween he seemed annoyed that Megan wanted to dress as Elsa as he always took pride in Maddie not dressing up as a princess like lots of her classmates. \n\nThis Christmas it has come to a head as Will spent all of Boxing Day playing the switch with Adam and Maddie and helping them build Lego while leaving Megan out. Will has offered Megan to play with them but she wants to play with her new toys and the games that she likes. I played with Megan most of the day but she asked if she could play her new barbie game on the switch for a while with her dad. I told them all to let her have a turn and play the barbie game with Megan. Adam and Maddie were actually fine and seemed to have fun but Will kept making fun of the game and telling Megan that other games like Mario kart were far more fun.\n\nI could see Megan losing confidence in wanting to play the game and she started to say she didn\u2019t want to play anymore so I pulled Will aside and told him off and said that while he was a great dad to Adam and Maddie he was being a bad dad to Megan by ignoring her interests. Will was really, really hurt by being called a bad dad and has been quiet ever since. The kids are now starting to notice that their dad is upset. I\u2019m now wondering if I was too harsh as he is generally a good dad and I do know that he loves Megan as much as he loves Adam and Maddie.\n\nEdit- thank you all for your comments, it\u2019s been really helpful to read through them all although some were hard to read. Will saw this post which I have to admit to myself I knew was a possibility as I used real names. We are going to have a long talk after the kids are in bed this evening but he has apologised to Megan and surprised her with tickets for the Frozen musical in the west end and they are currently making plans for a daddy daughter day out to London to have fun and see the show. I\u2019m hoping this was the kick up the arse he needed as I do genuinely believe he is a good dad and a good man.", "created_utc": 1672238573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxb94g/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_is_a_bad_dad_to/", "score": 5527, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If some of the parents I know had ever done this to their partners, a lot of my adult friends wouldn't be as traumatized as they are now. Seriously, good on you.

It's also this idea in culture (and geek culture specifically) \"feminine\" things are stupid and vapid while \"masculine\" things are cool and universal.

Don't take the last sentence out of context, hehe.", "NTA, and sorry to say that your kids seem to be more mature than their dad. They were accommodating but the adult wasn\u2019t. What a shame.

He's being incredibly selfish. He can be hurt all he likes, you didn't say anything that wasn't correct. This is his to fix.\n\nThe good news is it's fixable. He just needs to do better, and likely apologize to Megan.

Hopefully this will serve as a wake up call that will help him to establish a healthy relationship with all 3 of his children. The fact that it hurt him shows that he knows how serious it is and will, hopefully, help him to make the changes he needs to make.\n\nEdit:\n\nHonestly, he might feel bad, not because you called him out, but because of the crushing guilt from realizing he was neglecting one of his children. My wife has said stuff to me about how I've treated our daughter at times and it brought me to tears, not because she said something, but because I didn't realize I was doing something wrong and the guilt just hurt so much. That said, I'm a better father for knowing. Give him time to process his feelings, and then discuss with him how he can improve things.

I knew they loved me, and they actually liked me as a person too. \n\nYour husband is failing to show that he actually likes his kids for who they are, not who he wants them to be.

It's good that he's upset, as hopefully it means he will be open to a discussion about why he thinks it is OK to bully his own daughter for having interests different than his own.

Good on you for standing up for the youngest. NTA", "NTA -- Does it hurt feelings to find out you are dropping the ball as a parent? God yes! The absolute shittiest feeling in my opinion. Stewing in hurt feelings over your failings doesn't fix it though. As a parent, this should be something he immediately begins course correcting, because he cares about not hurting his children. Instead he is being a bad dad to all his kids and a bad partner by giving everyone the silent treatment.  \n\n\nIt is one thing to need time and space to process something. It is another to shut down and withdraw, that simply is not a luxury parents can indulge in, not over something so simple as \"hey, quit ignoring and shaming your kid's interests\".   \n\n\nYou say he is a really great dad, but is he a great dad even when things aren't going his way or things he likes? See, an actual great parent doesn't shut out the aspects of their kids that don't fit their fandom/hobby. An actual great parent is invested in the CHILD with the interests of the child being secondary to actually valuing the child. They are nurturing the child with the child's interests being nurtured in the process. Not great parents value the child having the same interests as them, with the interests being primary and the child being secondary. They nurture their interests and the child is nurtured so long as they are attached to the interest.   \n\n\nYour husband sounds like the second one.", "NTA. \n\nYour husband\u2019s rhetoric is rooted in misogyny. I\u2019m into some pretty nerdy fandoms, and this is so pervasive in those communities. Women can\u2019t win.
