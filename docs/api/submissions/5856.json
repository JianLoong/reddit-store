{"id": 5856, "submission_id": "zxb94g", "title": "AITA for telling my husband he is a bad dad to one of our kids", "selftext": "Me (F36) and my husband Will (M35) have three kids Adam (M9), Maddie (F7) and Megan (F6). Will has always been into video games, Star Wars and anime etc. It\u2019s never been my cup of tea but I think it\u2019s healthy that we have separate hobbies and interests and we have other stuff in common. \n\nWhen we had Adam Will was super excited to share his interests with him and bought him Star Wars themed babygrows and toys etc. For Adam\u2019s first Halloween Will dressed him up as Darth Vader and it was super cute. It was the same for the girls. I did tell Will that I had no issue with this while the kids were small but we had to let them develop their own interests. As it turns out both Adam and Maddie love playing computer games with their dad and have similar interests so there have been no issues. \n\nThe problem now is that as Megan is getting older she is showing more interest in princesses and barbies etc and finds her dad and siblings\u2019 interests boring. Will seems to have an issue with this and keeps trying to encourage Megan more towards his interests. At Halloween he seemed annoyed that Megan wanted to dress as Elsa as he always took pride in Maddie not dressing up as a princess like lots of her classmates. \n\nThis Christmas it has come to a head as Will spent all of Boxing Day playing the switch with Adam and Maddie and helping them build Lego while leaving Megan out. Will has offered Megan to play with them but she wants to play with her new toys and the games that she likes. I played with Megan most of the day but she asked if she could play her new barbie game on the switch for a while with her dad. I told them all to let her have a turn and play the barbie game with Megan. Adam and Maddie were actually fine and seemed to have fun but Will kept making fun of the game and telling Megan that other games like Mario kart were far more fun.\n\nI could see Megan losing confidence in wanting to play the game and she started to say she didn\u2019t want to play anymore so I pulled Will aside and told him off and said that while he was a great dad to Adam and Maddie he was being a bad dad to Megan by ignoring her interests. Will was really, really hurt by being called a bad dad and has been quiet ever since. The kids are now starting to notice that their dad is upset. I\u2019m now wondering if I was too harsh as he is generally a good dad and I do know that he loves Megan as much as he loves Adam and Maddie.\n\nEdit- thank you all for your comments, it\u2019s been really helpful to read through them all although some were hard to read. Will saw this post which I have to admit to myself I knew was a possibility as I used real names. We are going to have a long talk after the kids are in bed this evening but he has apologised to Megan and surprised her with tickets for the Frozen musical in the west end and they are currently making plans for a daddy daughter day out to London to have fun and see the show. I\u2019m hoping this was the kick up the arse he needed as I do genuinely believe he is a good dad and a good man.", "created_utc": 1672238573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxb94g/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_is_a_bad_dad_to/", "score": 933, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If some of the parents I know had ever done this to their partners, a lot of my adult friends wouldn't be as traumatized as they are now. Seriously, good on you.

The fact that it hurt him shows that he knows how serious it is and will, hopefully, help him to make the changes he needs to make.\n\nEdit:\n\nHonestly, he might feel bad, not because you called him out, but because of the crushing guilt from realizing he was neglecting one of his children. My wife has said stuff to me about how I've treated our daughter at times and it brought me to tears, not because she said something, but because I didn't realize I was doing something wrong and the guilt just hurt so much. That said, I'm a better father for knowing. Give him time to process his feelings, and then discuss with him how he can improve things.

Good on you for standing up for the youngest. NTA", "NTA -- Does it hurt feelings to find out you are dropping the ball as a parent? God yes! The absolute shittiest feeling in my opinion. Stewing in hurt feelings over your failings doesn't fix it though. As a parent, this should be something he immediately begins course correcting, because he cares about not hurting his children. Instead he is being a bad dad to all his kids and a bad partner by giving everyone the silent treatment.  \n\n\nIt is one thing to need time and space to process something. It is another to shut down and withdraw, that simply is not a luxury parents can indulge in, not over something so simple as \"hey, quit ignoring and shaming your kid's interests\".   \n\n\nYou say he is a really great dad, but is he a great dad even when things aren't going his way or things he likes? See, an actual great parent doesn't shut out the aspects of their kids that don't fit their fandom/hobby. An actual great parent is invested in the CHILD with the interests of the child being secondary to actually valuing the child. They are nurturing the child with the child's interests being nurtured in the process. Not great parents value the child having the same interests as them, with the interests being primary and the child being secondary. They nurture their interests and the child is nurtured so long as they are attached to the interest.   \n\n\nYour husband sounds like the second one.", "NTA. \n\nYour husband\u2019s rhetoric is rooted in misogyny.

Maybe try to encourage her interests just as much and use them to bond with her over them a little better.\" Hearing that, he might have felt bad for not realizing it but it might have sparked a change. That's what a good parent would do. Seemed you didn't give him the opportunity to do that before saying he was \"bad\". \n\nI think it's good you said something as he likely didn't notice, or maybe didn't realize how much it was affecting her. Maybe he thought he was being playful.

Half your point (the name thing) has absolutely nothing to do with this post. And if you think that would fit the bill of abuse in the 80s then I have some bad news for you...", "Not sure this is an exclusive behavior to one generation. My dad is a baby boomer and he was this kind of parent. If it was something he was interested in, you had his attention. Otherwise don\u2019t bother dad with your \u201cboring\u201d interests. It\u2019s just selfish narcissistic parenting and it happens no matter the generation.", "Trying to ascribe this to one generation is pretty dumb.", "Because baby boomers haven\u2019t been like this about sports or fishing? No baby boomer parent has made their children go into dance or acting to fulfill the parents dream? This is a completely recent phenomenon, you\u2019re definitely right.", "Heck, can you even imagine what if Adam wants to try these things as well?", "And you know this because you can look into the future?", "Maybe those games were just too easy and silly for them? People don't need to like the same things and accusing everyone of misogyny does nothing for anyone", "So why does this dad favor his son who has stereotypical \u201cboy\u201d interests? If he\u2019s only proud of kids who deviate from gender norms, he would be favoring the older girl and treating both his son and youngest daughter badly.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously not about uniqueness. It\u2019s about liking the \u201cright\u201d things.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s pretty damn unique to have different interests than the rest of your family.", "In being unique sure, but pride simply in them being different while your other daughter you criticize for liking things that are typically \u201cgirly\u201d sends a very different message. You can be proud of all your kids for their passions and interests without putting anyone down for having interests you don\u2019t like. \n\nIt\u2019s the contrast in situation that highlights the potential issue of misogyny. If you\u2019re proud of one kid for not liking things other girls like and you put the other down for liking girl things\u2026 that kinda says the issue is the girly interests which typically comes out of toxic views of how we value girls\u2019 interests. We see it in video games, music, movies, media consumed, etc. it\u2019s not just blatant \u201cgirls stuff is dumb\u201d but in what we associate with girls\u2019 interests and how we value and nurture that interest.       \n\nHe could have been happy his daughter wanted to get into video games too, instead he was critical of the game she was excited about because he doesn\u2019t value the media she enjoys because it\u2019s just normal girl stuff.", "Lol A+", "I can\u2019t even imagine what that has to do with anything, your husband didn\u2019t refute your statement with claims that you are unequal as well.  I think the comment you replied to was really hoping for a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment instead of replying to relevant facts. Your husband\u2019s behavior is wrong but based on your edit it sounds like he\u2019s a good enough father to want to do better and that matters tremendously.", "Is he upset you posted this online?", "I've seen fully grown adults get so locked into video games that they forget the outside world and kinda forget that they are also parents/ coworkers/ cousins etc.\n\nIt seems this was more down to immaturity then anything deep seated.\n\nNTA", "It can be both. A lot of princess media does the whole \u201cUseless damsel in distress\u201d.\n\nBut also, dad shouldn\u2019t be \u201ctaking pride in the fact his child doesn\u2019t like princesses like all the other girls in her class.\u201d That\u2019s literally textbook \u201cnotliketheothergirls\u201d type misogyny.", "I think people have generally moved on from that. And two things can be true at once. Stereotyping girls into a little box is bad, but making fun of them for being stereotypical is also bad", "No. Princess stuff is criticized by misogynists far more. There is nothing wrong with anyone wanting to be 'girly', the problem is with people who find anyone wanting to be 'girly' to be gross or wrong. Much of the criticism around girliness is internalized misogyny. \n\n\nPlaying princess might be playing that the child gets to dress up and be pretty, which is fine- vanity is not actually a problem, and people are allowed to like how they look. Or it might be that the child wants to play as a person within a power structure with some struggle, like a knight fighting a dragon. Court intrigue can be just as engaging and dangerous. \n\nThe inherent problem is that Will doesn't approve of something that already indicates a problem with internalized patriarchy, then he excludes his child for her interests. So he is both a misogynist and too emotionally immature to engage with his children on their level.", "Some princess stuff definitely does lean towards misogyny/sexism, like the message that Ariel should give up her voice (and her love of singing with it) to be with a man. Don\u2019t give up hobbies (or your whole family and culture) for dudes. \n\nHowever, just being into princess stuff in general? That\u2019s fine. And certainly there are better princess role models than there used to be: Brave, Elsa, Mulan, etc. \n\nIf the parents are cognizant of the messages there kids are getting from media and able to have conversations about that stuff with the kids, I\u2019d say all princess stuff is fine.", "Lol yea\u2026\n\nPeople usually take pride in their son not liking things like trucks and dinosaurs too, right..?", "headcanon how? it\u2019s literally in the post that he doesn\u2019t like girly things, thinks they\u2019re stupid, and makes fun of her for liking them", "No, I'm just guessing based on what we already know, like everyone else here. But I think it's reasonable to assume if he does it to one child he'll do it to the others", "It's not misogynistic to have preferences for your children's interests dude lol", ">For example, if I was a father, I would take interest in the things that my kids love\n\nThis is why the post seems so cruel to me. She met him halfway with wanting to play the video game with him- not the other gifts. She showed an interest and he shut her down. He only needed to have love and enthusiasm about spending time with her.", "Not enjoying the same types of games isn\u2019t sexist.

Don\u2019t get me wrong there is no such thing as a perfect person but I could definitely put my husband in my category of perfect. Men don\u2019t realize it\u2019s literally thee small things that do so much. Like for Christmas he bought his daughter a Barbie airplane set two Barbie\u2019s some Polly pockets. Like he did that I had no idea about it. Yes I know just above the line but to his five year old he gave her everything she wanted."]}
