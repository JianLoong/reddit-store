But we realize that things like family supercede our hobbies. And most of us can go one sunday without watching all the action in real time. \n\n>but I needed to know if any of my players were going to score any touchdowns. \n\nWhy? Does your league give extra points for touchdowns you see live? No. 'Wanted'. The word you're looking for is not 'needed', it's 'wanted'.

You can miss a game a part of games for an hour hour and a half to be with families during the holiday. Everybody says oh I have to watch the game, you know what your life's not over if you miss it. Everything is recorded you can watch it later online. You're allowed to be there for your family. And you interrupt the prayer even though it was long and you did embarrass your wife and you were rude. Every sports fan always says that, but I'm a die hard fan you know what if you watch the game or if you don't watch the game it will still be played the information you need will be online. And if you don't see your players score a touchdown guess what he still scored you'll still get the points of your fantasy team. And I bet after the game you still go to the fantasy sites to see how many points your team scored because you don't have it running in your head.\n\nBe an adult, apologize to your wife, apologize to in-laws\n\nYta", "I'll say YTA for being so invested in your fantasy team that you need to know if your players are going to score.i play fantasy football too and I check my score like 3 times total on a Sunday.

The TV has always been playing football when we sit down to thanksgiving dinner which we serve at lunch time so...", "YTAH and kind of pathetic. You watched the games all day and couldn\u2019t deal with sitting down with family for 30 minutes to an hour. I watch football every Sunday all day, but I know once it\u2019s dinner time with my wife and kids tv goes off and it\u2019s time to spend that time together. The fact that you can\u2019t take a half hour or so to sit with family because of \u201cfantasy football\u201d is wild to me. I have three teams and guess what once you set your lineups you can\u2019t do anything about it.
