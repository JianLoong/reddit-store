My wife and I have a very productive and good relationship aside from the problem I am currently posting about.\n\nSo, I have a job engineering software, and as a side hustle an App I created on the side. I bring in after-tax about 200k a year and my wife has a Creative Writing degree and can bring in anywhere from 25k-40k a year. Unfortunately, after my daughter was born my wife wanted to be a SAHM as she had separation anxiety. I was very much against it as I really wanted a two-income household and I also dreamed of being a SAHD but knew it would never be possible in this economy and if I wanted to give my daughter a good life. My wife would not relent so I gave up and let her stay at home.\n\nSo, when I get my income, I put 65 percent in my investment and savings including my daughter's trust and her college fund. The remainder pays the bills, buys the groceries, and pays for me AND my wife's car. After everything there is about 2-3k left of fun money and I give my wife 900. It has worked for about 3 years but recently my wife has been very upset about the arrangement, I pay for every date, vacation, and family outing, so I don't get why she is upset.\n\nShe requested that at every pay cheque, I should give her half what I make, and we both can spend how we like. I said Absolutely not and that there was no way I am going to work my a$$ of 80 hours a week losing precious time with my daughter and come home to do chores just to give her 100k for lazing around and at that point there was no reason or incentive for me to work so hard anymore. Then she said I don't know how hard her job was and I was being unfair. I then requested that I quit my job, so she could find a job to support us, and we will see who has the harder job. She just stormed off and said I was an Asshole, but I went ahead and put in my 2 weeks as I have been thinking about quitting for almost 9 months now. When my wife found out I quit she was horrified and said there was no way her salary would support us. I told her that it would pay our bills, but we would have 0 left over but that's what she wanted anyway.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your insight and I accept that I am the asshole and in the wrong. My wife and I are having a serious talk about our family's future. I just apologized and begged for forgiveness, and we are both against divorce. I know this is a fast update, but I took what everyone said to heart. I have read EVERY SINGLE comment and have replied to most. I hope everyone has a GREAT DAY. \n\nSome friends and family have been Telling me I am in the wrong while others are saying my wife is the wrong one.\n\nSo, Reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1698598106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j70yd/aita_for_requesting_to_switch_places_with_my_wife/", "score": 413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you saving for everyone? Your daughter, yourself AND your wife? As in does she have access / is her name on the savings and investments account? You can afford to give her more than $900 and if you don\u2019t - is that she doesn\u2019t feel secure because she\u2019s not part of the financial planning? So many questions. \n\nPs: you both work - her at home, you at the office. So no, she\u2019s not be getting free money.

My husband and I don\u2019t even spend that much monthly combined, outside of vacations or weekend getaways. \n\nDid you ask her why she is making that request? Maybe she has a new friend that\u2019s in her ear about how \u201cunfair\u201d your current arrangement is or she\u2019s using part of that $900 to cover stuff for the home or your daughter because of inflation. \n\nWhat you did was pretty drastic, but I do think it\u2019ll help both of you gain a better understanding of the difficulties of each role.

Your wife had no business asking for half of your income (what you gave her for \"fun money\" is more than what most people who work get to spend as they like!), but knowing she can only bring home a fraction of what you do, you shouldn't have quit without discussing it with her and making a plan together.

You claim you have a good relationship with your wife other than this one thing but really this \"one\" thing is everything. You wanted a two income household yet it seems that what you really want is that your wife has to leave your daughter because you have to. Her 40k income will be eaten up by childcare and other work related expenses, daughter will have to be raised in child care but you'll have that two income household. You say your wife wants to be a sahm because she has \"separation anxiety\", Wth any mother who loves her child has anxiety regarding leaving them. It makes no financial sense for you to stay home and your wife to work instead. This is something you would've known before you even got married.

You see, in order to not pay much alimony and child support, he quit his high paying job and got a much lower paying job. The court based his support on an average of his old salary and the new. He asked the court if he could just pay the bills instead of giving me support, the answer was \"no\". The judge actually said to him, \"you're no longer in charge Mr. So and so\". \n   I then eventually had to leave my children to pursue a higher paying job so that they would have the things I grew up with. Seven years later I met, fell in love and married my husband. A few years afterward we adopted a child. When she was five we decided it would be best for our family for me to stay at home. My hubby had gotten a promotion, so we could afford it. She's 16 now and my older children tell her all the time how lucky she is to have had a full time mom. My hubby and I are true partners, we share everything and make all decisions together. \n    You are so wrapped up in what's fair and what's yours that you fail to understand that a family is a team effort.

Being a stay at home mother does not mean \"laying around all day\".  It is an incredibly hard job.  There are no start or quitting times.  There are no 15 minute breaks twice a day or work free lunch hour.  There is no vacation time away from it all.  Whether it is a stay at home mom or dad it is 24/7 work every day of every year.  There is no calling in sick and resting.  A stay at home parent typically makes 3 meals a day, does the shopping, house work, laundry, takes children to and from school, takes children to doctor and dentist appointments, takes children to extracurricular activities, plans and executes all family activities, and so on and so on.  If you think that quitting your job and staying home to take care of your family is going to be easy you are in for a rude awakening.  I encourage your wife to return to work full time and get all of the benefits they offer, including rest periods.  You will no longer have those things, or sick days, or work free vacations, or starting and quitting times.  Be sure you make 3 well balanced meals a day for your family.  When the children are sick you will be mother, nurse, doctor no matter how sick you are.  When they go to school that is when you will have time to do shopping, clean the house, start preparing meals, arranging your calendar around you children and wife's needs.  Your day will be done when you go to bed and start as soon as you get up.  Since your income will be so low be sure to pinch every single penny you get as far as you can.

If your child is in grade school there is really no world where being a SAHM is going to out benefit working, then coming home when the child is done school and you are done work. Again, this is just my experience, I am also biased because I would never enable a stay at home parent once the child is in normal, during the day, care.\n\nFrom your story I can't tell if your wife is currently working or if now you have no income coming in. I think ESH, in some ways your wife does more, in others you do more. I think there could have been a bigger discussion and more planning around you quitting. Like explain that either way you are quitting because you are burnt out and her asking for 100k adds to that burnout. Explain you need the break and want to put 2 weeks in but were willing to wait a month so she could get back into working first. It seems you also think her being a SAHM is her being lazy, again, the child is older, she probably has a lot less responsibilities then when the child was 1 and 2. \n\nCrappy situation, you better hope she doesn't want a divorce.", "That is truly bizarre.

In all fairness to OP, he made a lot more sacrifices in his youth to end up with the \\~300k of income. Their family is benefitting from that.

It may be easier for him as opposed to working 80 hrs per week and still cleaning the house after work and after weekends.", "He quit his job once the kid didn't need a full time carer at home and is refusing to work again to spite his partner and put his kid in a precarious and insecure home. He's going to cause the kid to suffer.", "He has medical records recommending not working due to mental health. Also being on the hook for it doesn\u2019t help her much if he doesn\u2019t actually pay it.", "Being forced to work a job that harms your mental health so the wife doesn't have to ever work again is 100% slavery. People gives absolutely no fucks about men if sacrificing their wellbeing helps women and children in some way. I say screw that.", "It doesn\u2019t make me feel in any way! And it is actually false\u2026 the first year yes the kid needs a lot of contact with the mother but past that is actually better to go to kindergarten! Also if both parents work one doesn\u2019t need to overwork and both can dedicate time to the child", " Another post that buries the lede.", "Poor guy. Was that in comments or did I just miss it? \n\nHonestly, my question then would be why do they have $3k in fun money a month and locking up 65% only to have 4k available then. It would seem he\u2019s smart enough to have a discussion \u201cI\u2019m taking a break for 6-12 months and we are going to save for it by cutting back?\u201d", "Its just the type of bias you will encounter in this sub.", "Let me quote Op from comments : \"My daughter goes to school and my mom and MIL clean our house. My wife just hund out with friends and shopped. I have told her about many times in therapy as I was suffering from burnout and doctor and therapist advised I quit but wife did not want loss of income. I almost jumped off a bridge in 2021 from work stress and I got hospitalized. Probably should've included in post.\" \n\nSo no he isnt quitting just out of spite. The wife wants her lavish lifestyle while also doing nothing at all, even if it means her husband is suffering.", "So he should burn his self out and barely be able to spend time with his child and be depressed? He\u2019s expressed numerous times that this isn\u2019t what he wants and it\u2019s been a burden on his mental health.", "He could have taken medical leave from work while improving his mental health and looking for a job that he could handle. Instead he nuked everything as a fuck you to his wife. I'm not saying she's in the right, but being a SAHD now is laughable. It also says in his post that she has been working so she's not some SAHM sitting around eating bonbons like he says she does.\n\nThat money he's going to end up being court ordered to pay won't just disappear because he refuses to work. It will accumulate and there are consequences at some point for not paying.\n\nETA: I misread. When he stated her earning power I'd read it as what she brought in.", "Kids don\u2019t go to kindergarten at a year old dude. Sounds like you expected a two income household and your child to be raised by strangers. Why did you have children in the first place without discussing these things with each other? Children are tiny humans, not accessories or status symbols.", "Yes it was in the comments that he tried to\u2026 unalive himself two years ago. It seems like it\u2019s just getting worse for him and she simply doesn\u2019t care. If she\u2019s that bold to ask for half of his salary to buy herself even more designer stuff I doubt she\u2019d be open to any changes that don\u2019t benefit her. He even said in a different comment he was spending half of his fun money on gifts for her to make her happy.", "He said he\u2019s been wanting to quit for months and she knew that. Obviously they have more money tied up in investments", "I guarantee if his wife came on here complaining of burnout from being. SAHM the tone would be different. They\u2019d be demanding he do more on top of the 80 hrs.", "He could cut back on hours, find a way to transition to a different job, etc. Instead he just quit working and told his wife she was now solely responsible for all the bills. He's spiteful."]}
