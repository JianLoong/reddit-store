I don\u2019t know what i did wrong in that situation, plus aside from confronting him with a cop even if he was let go we would be out on the streets surrounded by hundreds of people which meant he wouldn\u2019t do anything as people would come for him if we stood up for him.

At the very least getting the police involved distracted him long enough for you to get away.", "That guy felt 100% comfortable following you around and harassing you. What\u2019s stopping him to kicking it up a notch and actually doing something illegal? NTA, at least now the police know to keep an eye on him.", "NTA. There's no reason he should be allowed to do this"]}
