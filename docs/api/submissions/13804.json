They met during Covid so we never really spent much time with him, so it feels like less. She never really seems to have gotten out of the honeymoon phase, because she never shuts up about him. None of it is particularly impressive. Its just normal stuff. He owns his own home. He drives a nice car. Her kids like him. It's all so basic.\n\nMy dad and I used to bond over making fun of him (he works an IT job from home and my dad always thinks office workers are soft). Over time Dave has sucked up to my Dad. He built Dad a barbecue pit and set up cameras around his house. He did a few home repairs for my parents house,  and now my dad treats him like the son he never had.. they go fishing together,  which my dad has never shown any interest in before. My husband has gone a few times and says he always feels like a third wheel even though my dad has known him since high school\n\nThe incident happened the other day.  My daughter (6mo) has been going through a fussy phase.  She just cries constantly and won't sleep for more than and hour. My family were having a party and I asked my mother to take the baby because I just wanted a break from the crying 3 inches from my ear and lie down. I ended up sleeping for 4 hours and came down to find goddamned Dave holding _my_ baby. I quickly took my baby back to feed her and she started crying again after the bottle finished. My mom said to give her to Dave, because he was able to sooth her the last time. I said no, I didn't want someone who wasn't family holding her. My mom tried to argue, but it's my choice, and I didn't want him anywhere near her.. my mom must have said something to Kate because they left soon after and Kate was glaring at me. \n\nMost of my family think I'm an AH, even though I didn't actually ask them to leave. I think I was perfectly in my rights to not want him to hold my baby.", "created_utc": 1680445241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129mo4e/aita_for_making_my_sisters_perfect_bf_leave_my/", "score": 497, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dave sounds like a good dude. Why are you so mean?", "YTA. You seem jealous, petty, judgmental, and incredibly immature.\n>\nBonding over being cruel and talking about someone\u2019s career behind their back is incredibly toxic. I\u2019m glad your dad escaped your toxic clutch.", "So for several years Dave has been with your sister, treating her in a way that makes her feel so loved and cared for, and instead of being happy for her you\u2019re\u2026annoyed? Did I get that right?\n\nYou sound exhausting and awful to be around. You\u2019re deeply jealous, obnoxious, and rude. Dave sounds like a generous, kind, and thoughtful person. \n\nSomeone in this story is basic, and it\u2019s not Dave. YTA.", "YTA. What\u2019s your problem with Dave? \n\nListen, when you have a kid, and you decide to wander off and take a FOUR HOUR NAP, you better be grateful for whatever capable person that stepped up to take care of your kid. You probably don\u2019t have a lot of people to do that for you, since no one outside the family is allowed to hold YOUR baby. Your language about this guy is so dismissive but you can\u2019t provide any instance about why you don\u2019t like him. But that line about YOUR husband feeling like a third wheel is very telling. He was probably the golden boy, right? Having known your family since high school. But you don\u2019t mention anything your husband has done to help your family. Then Dave comes along, doing favors for your dad, enjoying hobbies with him, and now you\u2019re mad that your husband isn\u2019t number one anymore. Am I close?", "Yta - you don't have a reason to dislike him other than you used to enjoy being mean about him with your dad. He didn't suck up - he did favors. Like holding a crying baby when NO ONE ELSE INCLUDING ITS MOTHER wanted to. It doesn't particularly sound like you like Kate either so I guess feel free to keep burning that bridge.", "YTA. So, let me see if I have this right: you are annoyed that your sister has found a guy that she is over the moon I love with. And then, you are further annoyed when, after you spent time making fun of him and bullying him for his profession, he makes a effort to get to know and make friends with your father, especially doing actual helpful things around the house. \n\nAnd then, to add insult to injury, this person who you liked to make fun of, manages to get your fussy baby to stop crying when you can\u2019t, and this sets you off. \n\nAnything I am missing?", "YTA. You sound extremely jealous and miserable.", "Your back story doesn\u2019t help you like you think. It makes you seem really mean and gross. \nYou are certainly allowed to decide who gets to hold your baby, but why did you have to be so rude? He was willing to help soothe your baby in full view of your family, not in a creepy out of sight manner (if this is what your worry is) to give YOU, a TIRED MOM, the rest that you wanted.

You don\u2019t like him for what reason now? That he met your sister during Covid or he has an office job? What that your sister is still in the honeymoon phase after 4 years. \n\nThere is something missing, either you can\u2019t stand anyone else in the family having a good partner or you have some unresolved self-esteem jealousy issues. What you posted doesn\u2019t make sense for why you are upset or so against dave. You need to figure that out, Reddit cannot. All we can tell you is that you are in fact the AH and nothing is wrong with Dave. Your immediate defense that your husband is hotter and more interesting is suspicious. Being hot and interesting does not mean it\u2019s a good relationship.\n\nWhat is wrong with you?", "YTA Jesus you sound insufferable. You\u2019re jealous of Dave, that much is apparent. You lashed out. Unless you have a legitimate (And I mean actually legitimate reason not just \u201cI don\u2019t want someone not family holding my kid\u201d) reason to dislike him, you owe both him and your sister an apology. \n\nParents are allowed to have boundaries about their kids that should be respected.

You need to do some hard thinking, OP, dig right down to the root of your resentment of Dave, because it certainly seems as if he\u2019s done nothing wrong but - gasp! - be a good guy.  How can you possibly hate someone that babies love?!", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t have to let anyone hold your baby if you\u2019re not comfortable with it but aside from that\u2014as far as I can tell from this post\u2014you seem to just kind of dislike this guy for no real reason.

Dave has never done anything bad to you or your family, you have zero reason to hate him. He has more reason not to like you, since you used to enjoy making fun of him with your dad, and you seem to miss that. You sound jealous of him honestly. Your comment about not wanting him \"anywhere near\" your baby was completely uncalled for. If you don't want him to hold her, I mean fine, that's your choice (even if you have absolutely no reason not to trust him), but there are occasions where they'll be near each other like family gatherings and you need to deal with it. You are going to ruin your relationship with your sister and you have no one to blame but yourself.", "YTA i love how you use \"her kids like him\" as being something basic, but your kid also likes him, to the point where he is better at consoling her than you are.\n\nYou are perfectly in your rights to say that somebody cant hold your baby, but god damn are you an AH about everything else. Do you ever get tired of yourself?", "YTA\n\nYou just sound mean. You and your dad bonded over making fun of him? That's just nasty and honestly colors anything else you said in your post. Dave sounds like a nice guy that you (and your husband) quite frankly sound rather jealous of. Saying you don't want him to hold your baby because he isn't \"family\" is just nasty as well. You sound like a completely unpleasant person.", "YTA so let me get this straight. Your sisters bf makes her so happy she can't stop talking about him. He's become friends with your skeptical dad and won him over. And even you 6month old likes him. And you and you alone seem to have a problem with all this.\n\nSounds like your jealous of the space he's taken up that I'm guessing you and your husband partly filled before.", "Yta and seem jealous she is happy and that your dad actually likes him now. How rude of you to leave the baby with other for 4hrs and then have a problem with a man holding said baby while around your family. OK so stop asking others to babysit and parent on your own with your husband. \n\nYou sound jealous and bitter that he's a good man and your family likes him and treats him well. If your husband felt like a third wheel that's his problem.", "YTA you have a problem with him for no reason, sorry he was helping with your baby more than your actual husband", "YTA, your post reads like all Dave has tried to do was help your family and make an effort and your jealous maybe if your husband out more effort in he'd be less of a third wheel. He was trying to help you have a break and you threw a fit", "YTA - This was a lot of words to say I\u2019m jealous of my sister, Dave, and their relationship happiness. Instead of taking it out on them, why not work on bettering yourself as an individual and you and your husband work on your relationship? \n\nIt\u2019s you babe, your the problem in this situation.", "YTA. Jealousy is a disease, get better soon.", "YTA 100%\n\nYou also sound jealous, petty, and childish. Bonding with your father over making fun of the guy?

It doesn\u2019t sound like he is doing anything wrong.\n\nYTA for how you are treating him for sure.", "Babies, like animals, are very good judges of character because they don\u2019t come with mental baggage. \nYour baby likes Dave, your sister adores Dave, your parents like Dave, Reddit likes Dave. \nTo you he may be basic, maybe he is? Is there anything wrong with that? You should want your sister to be happy. \nUnfortunately you\u2019ve come off here as incredibly jealous, which you insist you\u2019re not so let\u2019s give you the benefit of the doubt. \nYou sound like you needed a break from your daughter, we\u2019ve all been there. Are you ok? Because it really seems like you\u2019re projecting some issues. Your anger is misplaced, you didn\u2019t expect him to step up but he did and let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s probably getting mean girl vibes from you. Going forward, Perhaps just give him a chance?", "Yes, YTA. I'm not understanding what you don't like about this fella, seems to me like your jealous regarding his success & his ability to easily get along with your family. I get not wanting him to hold your baby, but you were an AH regarding that too.

Dave sounds like fun. Try getting to know him instead of constantly comparing him to your husband and how \u2018everyone likes him\u2019. YTA for being rude and mean for no other reason.", "YTA. You are ridiculously jealous of your family's affection for Dave.\n\nYou really sound like you have issues that need to be worked out with a therapist. You're super toxic.", "Yeah you\u2019re being a massive asshole, glad you asked. You\u2019re spitting venom all through this post, and why? Because Dave seems like a good guy? Because your Dad likes Dave more than your husband and now you and your Dad don\u2019t bond over ragging on Dave together? Your pettiness is showing and it\u2019s not pretty.\nYes, YTA.", "YTA. Owning a house, a car, and having a good relationship with your kids is not basic.", "YTA. You napped for 4 hours with no care for your \"fussy\" baby - what were they supposed to do? Ignore your baby? Wake you? Dave was helping to look after the child you were ignoring. You should be angry at yourself for your atrocious behaviour.", "YTA you should try to be more like Dave he sounds like a very nice addition to the family lol", "WOW.  Completely YTA. You need to chill the f out. \n\nYour sister loves this guy. He's good to her. He helped your dad with things because he's a nice guy. He tried to help with the baby because he's a nice guy. Anyone would be lucky to find someone like him and I think that's the problem...Where is your baby's dad and why didn't he help you out with the crying kid?  You really have a chip on your shoulder. You need to apologize.", "YTA. David literally did nothing wrong. You and your father were bullies; you thought it was okay to ridicule him just because of his job. And WTF about office workers being soft? At least your father changed and became nicer to him. You're just mad because your heart is full of hate; you're jealous and possessive of your family and you see him as an intruder. You're an asshole and I feel sorry for your child to grow up with someone as hateful as you. I bet when your child starts dating, you'll be determined to drive their partner away too because God forbid you shouldn't be the center of attention at all times.", "So just to check\nHe is nice to your sister.\nHe is helpful and nice to your parents.\nHe helped soothe your fussy baby that you foisted onto your mum for 4 hours.\nYTA he seems like a decent guy making an effort to be part of the family. Get your husband to take the baby next time", "So Dave is by your own account a stable guy who everyone likes, other than finding him \u201cboring\u201d what\u2019s the real issue? He has his own home and car, a stable \u201cboring\u201d job, your sister is over the moon about him, her kids are happy, he\u2019s helpful to your parents\u2026 you have no negatives to actually include but you sound so angry. \n\nLong standing jealousy towards your sister or your parents favoring her? Was your husband the only thing that made you \u201csuperior\u201d to her and now she has the preferred son in law? Is your husband maybe not that great and you\u2019re jealous? Is it the hormones from your recent birth making you irrational? You need to figure it out because YTA massively and you\u2019re only going to fracture important relationships for yourself.", "YTA. Dave sounds like a nice guy who\u2019s good for your sister, and you sound extremely jealous.", "YTA, it would be healthy to recognize what part about him is angering you and what part about jealousy is angering you. From this post, it appears the latter is the bulk of it", "So to be clear\u2026. You feel left out because your father and Dave started hanging out more. A new addition changed the dynamic you had and were comfortable with. So you lash out because none of it has been addressed neither internally nor externally through communication? \n\nYou\u2019re not TA for not wanting someone not close to you holding your child.

They met during Covid so we never really spent much time with him, so it feels like less. She never really seems to have gotten out of the honeymoon phase, because she never shuts up about him. None of it is particularly impressive. Its just normal stuff. He owns his own home. He drives a nice car. Her kids like him. It's all so basic.\n\nMy dad and I used to bond over making fun of him (he works an IT job from home and my dad always thinks office workers are soft). Over time Dave has sucked up to my Dad. He built Dad a barbecue pit and set up cameras around his house. He did a few home repairs for my parents house,  and now my dad treats him like the son he never had.. they go fishing together,  which my dad has never shown any interest in before. My husband has gone a few times and says he always feels like a third wheel even though my dad has known him since high school\n\nThe incident happened the other day.  My daughter (6mo) has been going through a fussy phase.  She just cries constantly and won't sleep for more than and hour. My family were having a party and I asked my mother to take the baby because I just wanted a break from the crying 3 inches from my ear and lie down. I ended up sleeping for 4 hours and came down to find goddamned Dave holding _my_ baby. I quickly took my baby back to feed her and she started crying again after the bottle finished. My mom said to give her to Dave, because he was able to sooth her the last time. I said no, I didn't want someone who wasn't family holding her. My mom tried to argue, but it's my choice, and I didn't want him anywhere near her.. my mom must have said something to Kate because they left soon after and Kate was glaring at me. \n\nMost of my family think I'm an AH, even though I didn't actually ask them to leave. I think I was perfectly in my rights to not want him to hold my baby.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'd be glad my older sister is with someone like Dave. Even your kid like him.", "Acting like a petty teenager who makes fun of someone who treats her sister and family well is actually boring. It\u2019s so high school mean girl - predictable, immature, basic and boring.", "You sound icky, insecure, boring, and an all around mean girl. Is your husband cheating on you by any chance?", "Your \\*nightmare\\* is that your sister's fella is a likeable standup guy?", "Waaahhhhh someone call her a waaaambulance", "Your only method of attack so far is calling him boring. Has he ever done anything antagonistic or hateful towards you or your family? If not, you sound like a huge AH.", "So what is it that makes you so much more colorful and interesting than Dave? You don't sound especially thrilling from your comments.\n\nWould you rather that Dave was an abusive deadbeat who treated your family like shit? Someone that the rest of the family would join you in bullying? Or do you just not want your sister to be happy?", "Why does it bother you that people like him despite his being \u201cbasic\u201d? Why does this present a threat to you? Listen to your feelings cuz they\u2019re telling you something. \n\nYou treated Dave, lil ol\u2019 boring beige Dave, as a threat to your baby and to yourself. Despite making it clear you don\u2019t actually see him as a threatening person. Quite the opposite. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to share with us, but consider why those feelings are there. Do you feel your own husband deserves more appreciation or love from your family? Do you feel like your sister is being celebrated for her choice in a partner and you aren\u2019t? Why are you feeling threatened by someone who you describe as not being a threat?", "Quite frankly after reading this and your comments you sound like a massive AH and an even bigger BULLY! \n\nThe way you talk about him makes me cringe. \n\nYou haven\u2019t given any reason as to why Dave is a bad person or stated a single argument as to why we should be on your side. \n\nIn fact the only thing you have confirmed for me is that Dave seems like a nice guy who is trying to fit in with the family. \n\nYou say he has been with your sister for 4 years so he is hardly a stranger. \n\nIt seems to me that you are JEALOUS of him for being a nice person, getting on with your family and being able to settle your baby when you couldn\u2019t ( an issue in which you were complaining about) \n\nMaybe you should actually take some time to get to know him properly instead of being so judgemental. \n\nI do agree however that you do have say on who holds your baby but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the actual issue here.", "So do you think that he knows that you don't like him and he is purposely being the good guy just to get on your nerves?  \n\nit's just as stupid s your other reasons for being all pissy about it.", "Lol, you sound like you're 15. And a very basic 15 year old at that. OMG, he's not interesting enough!!! Maybe he even wears glasses???? \n\nI feel truly sorry for your kid. You're going to mess her up sooooo badly", "Where is your husband when the baby needs to be cared for? Looks like Dave stepped up.", "So explain exactly what negative thing you don\u2019t like about him. We don\u2019t see it so you need to tell us.", "What did you expect? You can and asked a bunch of strangers to validate your behavior which makes NO SENSE!!", "Boring?\n\nDude builds BBQ pits and goes fishing.\n\nYou give off the vibes of someone who talks about reality tv.", "Dave sounds lovely YTA", "Op, Dave might be beige and boring according to your own description, but this post is making YOU come off as a mean girl, who is either jealous over her sister and/or boyfriend, or who has some other issues making her mean and nasty. You are revealing far more about yourself with this post than you did about Dave. Maybe have a think why so many people here seem to think you are the one with issues.", "You're a bully and YTA.", "Maybe you should try having more interesting nightmares, you sound boring.", "What is your actual problem? Lmaooo you still haven't given a good enough reason as to why you don't like him. \n\nNone of us see what or why you hate Dave other than you think he's \"boring.\" Which, he actually seems fun and kind to me so yeah, decent people will tend to gravitate to other decent people.\n\nI'm sorry no one seems to gravitate to you or your \"hotter\" husband. Lmao \n\nAnd yeah, YTA. Obviously.", "Are you sure you're in your 30's? You seem to be 2 teenagers in a trench coat with that jealousy and attitude", "Why do you care if he is boring and not as attractive as your husband?.. you are not in a relationship with him. Your sister is. \n\nAlso how do you know he is boring? You said so yourself, you do not know him.\nHe seems to be helpful, and sweet, good with your sister kid, and loves your sister. Hell you even said he even got your father into a new hobby, fishing.", "I see why you hate him now. You\u2019re just a mean ***** who cant stand to see your sister and family happy", "Mind your business if he's so beige. Why is he so on your mind, if he's so beige? Dude. Take a chill pill. Everyone is jumping on, because you haven't given us a reason to dislike Dave or to like you more.", "**You don't have to like Dave.**\n\nBut it's kinda weird how much you hate him for being boring and liked by others. \n\nLike, just let the dude be happy. Let your sister be happy. You don't need to impose your opinions about other people on them. You don't need to be rude. You can just let people exist and be unbothered by it.", "So your only criticism of him is that he's boring? You treated him rudely because you didn't want your baby to catch beige disease from him? Maybe your husband should have been more helpful and less \"interesting.\"", "Are you 33 or 3?", "So delete your post and keep this jealous crap to yourself. No one is going to be on your side, because you're in the wrong. I hope they disown you until you figure it out.", "Btw, no wonder your kid is screaming all the time. She's probably realizing what a bad hand life's dealt her, being your daughter and all.", "Nothing boring about a man who can calm a crying baby. Or do home upgrades diy, or that brings home money. Or who gets along well with others.\nMaybe you are drama queen? And that\u2019s why stability and kindness looks boring to you?", "Why? Why do you care about people liking a guy you consider kinda boring? It's like the biggest non-problem anyone could possibly face.", "Tell us all about how cool and interesting you are then. Reads like someone who\u2019s got the hump for not being centre of attention", "You have lame nightmares. It makes me wonder if your husband is as interesting as you think he is.", "Holy fuck you are really fucking stupid", "I\u2019d rather hang out with Dave than you. I wonder if your husband felt the same and that\u2019s why he stopped going fishing with them?", "You\u2019re jealous, conceited, and just plain mean! You didn\u2019t thank him? He did NOTHING wrong. He let you sleep for four hours and you repay him by being a brat? I would self reflect if I were you, I\u2019d hate to be your husband. Poor Dave and poor family members. You owe them all a HUGE apology, apparently that nap didn\u2019t help your crankiness. You asked if YTA and you obviously were and now you\u2019re mad everyone sided with the perfectly nice Dave. You might consider therapy", "What makes you so exciting in comparison?", "Cry harder lol", "What can I say, I appreciate a man who actually *knows how to do things* and is generous with his assistance and time.\n\nA genuinely good man is fantastic.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan yourself, but you're behaving poorly. Does your husband parent the baby? Does he step up without being asked to do regular things around the house? Because yeah, jealousy is the most likely culprit here.\n\nYTA.", "Your hotter and more interesting husband wasn\u2019t interested in soothing his own baby like boring Dave was lol. Dave has a trend of being a good father, son, and husband and you\u2019re jelly lol", "Lol girl you need to chill out, nothing wrong with being \"boring.\" You say your husband is more interesting and more attractive. Yall all thought Dave just did IT work and made fun of him for it, but yet there he is fixing things up for your family, setting up a security system for them, and all this other amazing hands on things. Has your husband done any of that? What \"interesting\" things is he bringing to the table for your family?", "Not everyone loves toxic abusive relationships like yours. Sorry that Dave is such a good guy. You are the definition of misery loves company. Your family can't get out fast enough", "Yea, I feel like her husbands complete absence from this post, besides the line about feeling like a third wheel now, tells us everything we need to know. \n\nI see it like this: Dave being a nice guy equals \u2018boring\u2019 to OP. OP calls her husband \u2018interesting\u2019. With boring and interesting being opposites, I can only imagine OPs husband is the opposite of a \u2018nice guy\u2019. She didn\u2019t even mention her dad \u2018liking\u2019 her husband, only that he\u2019s known him longer. This is purely speculation on my part, but he\u2019s probably a dirtbag who doesn\u2019t help out in any real way and she\u2019d constantly having to make excuses for him and pick up his slack. Not that much of a stretch to see why having a husband like that would make one SEETHE with rage, jealousy, and resentment towards a Dave.", "Her husband was too busy being way hotter and more interesting.", "She probably married him for his looks and disregards the fact he brings nothing else to the table. I mean she says he is so much better looking and interesting in a comment but clearly he can't take care of his own kid, so just how capable is he?", "Oh wow, I was completely unprepared for this. \n\nFirst of all, obviously, none of this would have possible without DAVE. So I\u2019d just like to thank DAVE for being such a delightful and non-problematic addition to OP\u2019s family. For winning over a dad who used to enjoy making fun of his career, for caring for a baby who\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t be bothered to do it and took a four hour nap instead, and for being so damn wonderful that four years into their relationship, Kate is still walking on sunshine. This award is for you, DAVE. Keep up the outstanding work!", "And she called it \u201cthe incident\u201d \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.

OP is just pissy the baby figured her out so early and has replaced her with Dave.", "Yeah the quick defense that her husband was hotter and more interesting reeked of jealousy. Not sure what her husband is like but Dave sounds like the ideal guy. \n\nAnd what married person immediately defaults to my husband is hotter and more interesting\u2026nothing about him being a good husband or better in any meaningful way.
