You kicked out the friend because you are jealous of him.  \nI'm also diabetic and I don't rush to the doctor for every cut, much less the emergency room!

Who knows.\n\nNick did his best, but ultimately if it warranted a trip to the ER, that was Ezra's call (I mean, he's the one diabetic, he should know his medical situation).\n\nBut because Nick didn't immediately react how you would, and just patched up your bf, you kicked him out.\n\nThe dots aren't joining up here. From their perspective you sure as hell come across as the AH, and your own reasoning doesn't make it sound any better.\n\nIt just sounds like you're upset that your boyfriend spent more time with his friend (who he hasn't seen in a good while) more than he did with you, especially when you used phrases like \"Nick continued gatekeeping Ezra\". You're making all of this sound like it's all dastardly Nick's fault; twirling his evil moustache as he has his henchman tie your poor helpless, defenseless and blameless damsel Nick to some train tracks, before cutting his feet with glass.\n\nIt honestly sounds like you just don't like Nick and were looking the earliest opportunity to get rid of him.", "YTA \n\n>Nick continued gatekeeping Ezra for the rest of the next day, but honestly I didn\u2019t mind bc I had my own night out with my friends!\n\nI don't think you know what the word gatekeeping means.

If you wish to keep your boyfriend, you're going to have to be a little nicer.", "INFO What?\n\n>We, the 3 of us, immediately went to the ER that morning\n\nWhy?

Bringing diabetes and your dad into this is just silly. Ezra is the one with the condition, it really is his call on how to react to an incident such as this. \n\nIt really does sound like you're just spoiling for a fight because you didn't like being sidelined.

Nick handled it perfectly and if the wound didn't need stitches, he did exactly the right thing.", "\"They spent the entire day talking in that room and by the evening they basically cancelled our plans together. I thought it was rude to me but let it pass.\"\n\n\"Nick continued gatekeeping Ezra for the rest of the next day\"\n\nYour BF is bi....", "That's what I can't get past.   Guess what the ER is going to do for that cut? They're going to clean it, flush it with saline, MAYBE explore the wound to ensure there's no additional glass inside, put a bandaid on it and send you on your way - Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, enjoy your $250 to $500 copay.\n\n  \nSource:  I sliced my finger open last year.  They did all of the above, slapped some dermabond on it because it was a large wound, and that was it.", "Sounds like she has undiagnosed BPD", "I feel like you're ignoring the ER/risking his life stuff, huh? Kinda the point of the story, you know", "\"Many people with diabetes have peripheral artery disease (PAD), which reduces blood flow to the feet. Also, many people with diabetes have neuropathy, causing you to not feel your feet. Together, these problems make it easy to get ulcers and infections that may lead to amputation.\"\n\n\"About 1 in 5 people with diabetes who go to the hospital do so for foot problems. \"  \n\n\nEzra is okay, thanks for asking. He didn't need stiches, but they  sterilized and cleaned his wound properly. You can't be too careful about that stuff.", "Youre right. The issue is that in long time diabetics they have compromised circulation that causes delayed wound healing and the excess sugar feeds bacteria making them more prone to infection.\n\nHe didn\u2019t need an ER visit, he needed to watch for signs of infection and go to an urgent care.", "She showing some signs of BPD. My ex did the same things. Always knew better than everyone else", "I'm not even sure how is it relevant what Nick did in this situation - her BF knows about his own condition, if he felt OK with it, then it's on him, OP can be mad at BF, but she kicked out Nick?!", "I had just skimmed the first part and honestly thought Ezra was her puppy. It made more sense.", "All this!\n\nYTA OP", "Foot injuries can be very serious for diabetics. Due to poor circulation and the potential for diabetic neuropathy, foot injuries for people with diabetes can become infected quickly and have trouble healing.", "Because OP\u2019s father is a doctor? I guess?", "Because her dad is a dr! It\u2019s important to consider that. I mean there is a higher chance of infection with diabetes but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean go to the ER for every cut.", "That clearly makes OP a Dr. /s", "They did what Nick did:\n\n>He didn't need stiches, but they  sterilized and cleaned his wound properly. You can't be too careful about that stuff.", "But it's not good living with her", "As someone who is 6'6 I fully get nicks pain. Guys can be best buds and look out for each other without anything being sexual. Kinda weird to jump to that", "Lol I\u2019m glad someone asked this, I was wondering the same.", "She sounds annoying and a little controlling but this is a ridiculous armchair psychologist diagnosis lol", "No, I'm really not.  He stepped on glass and went to the ER - shit happens.    If he drops a glass with you and steps on a piece before deciding \"Nah, I don't need the ER visit\", are you going to kick your BF out of the apartment, too?\n\nAlso, a diabetic getting injured isn't an automatic death sentence like you're trying to make it out to be.  As long as he cleaned the wound and took care to keep it clean and dry, he'd like be okay (so long as he kept watch for any signs of infection)", "YTA. And a dense one at that huh", "Can you please explain how his life was at risk? As they mentioned in their comment, stepping on glass is a pretty common accident.", "My son is a diabetic, has been since he as a child. As a CHILD, if he stepped on glass wanna know how I would handle it? EXACTLY as your boyfriend and his friend would. Except we wouldn't have gone to the ER the next day because someone wanted to overreact. We would have kept an eye on it and made sure there were no issues, continued doctoring it and gone on with our lives. \n\nYTA. And probably a new boyfriend.", "But what does that have to do with how you treated his friend? Be mad at your boyfriend fine but treating his friend that way makes you TA", "My partner who I\u2019ve been with for over 25 years is diabetic and the amount of times he\u2019s cut himself is unbelievable, yet he\u2019s never turned septic and is still here without rushing to the emergency room. It was a simple cut that had been taken care off but you just couldn\u2019t have that could you? How on earth could a \u201ccollege dropout\u201d and your boyfriend know how to take care off a cut ESPECIALLY when you\u2019re the daughter of a DOCTOR!!!!! And all of your fathers medical knowledge has magically passed through his sperm into you!!! I mean how on earth did your diabetic boyfriend manage to get to the age he is without you being there to rush him to hospital every time he bleeds.\n\nYTA for treating your boyfriend as a child instead of an adult who can make his own decisions, also you need to check your jealousy and allow him to have his friends over if he wants. It\u2019s his flat too yet you feel entitled to tell his friend to get out \n\nBloody hell I\u2019ve heard of doctors wives who think they know everything but didn\u2019t realise that it applied to daughters too", "Nah.  The point of the story was showing reddit that you have some major red flags, and that your bf needs to dump your ass.", "So? Its his life, isn't it? If you don't think your bf can survive w/o you telling him what to do, then let me ask you how did you think he survived till he met you? Did he never had an injury? Lol  \n\nAnd why do you throw nick out when ezra injured himself by stepping on glass? Your whole reaction doesn't make any sense at all. \n\nYou sound hella controlling tbh. Your bf spending time with a friend for more than a few hours is not acceptable to you, and now you are pissed your bf is realizing how controlling you are? And as the cherry on top you see yourself as the mature one here? Lol", "Are you ignoring the fact that your BF is an adult?", "So what you're saying is, what Nick had done was exactly what needed to be done in the moment, and you then dragged everyone to an expensive and unnecessary ER appointment rather than just calling up his primary (if he is a diabetic and you have a doctor for a father, I'm assuming one of you has a primary), or going to urgent care where there is a $50 copay vs a $200+ ER copay?\n\nYou cost your bf unnecessary money AND hurt his friendship. Nice.", "Does he actually have any signs of diabetes in his feet though. Or are you playing dr?", "So the hospital did exactly what Nick did ? YTA you\u2019re kinda dense to be the daughter of a doctor. The ER is for real emergencies. Nobody goes to the ER for glass in their foot. I even stepped on a nail when I was in the 2nd grade, no ER. lol just admit you don\u2019t like Nick that\u2019s all. cuz you were wrong and yk it.", "Has Ezra been diagnosed with any of those things? Pretty sure he would notice if he couldn't feel his feet anymore, especially after stepping on glass.", "So all the same things you could have done at home? Wow, crazy. Are you paying the medical bill that you forced him to unnecessarily incur?", "You do not need a hospital to sterilize and clean a wound properly. If they had completely ignored the cut and he just ran around in the fort or something with it completely open, then yeah he\u2019s not being responsible. But they did what they were supposed to do. They cleaned it and covered it. You\u2019re being pretty paranoid. Also the feet issues are usually only with people who don\u2019t manage their diabetes well. I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t allow him even a chance to not handle his diabetes well. He\u2019s a grown man. You don\u2019t get to control every aspect of his life. If you\u2019re not okay with how he chooses to manage injuries, leave. Don\u2019t kick his friends out and tell him he\u2019s childish.", "So the ER did exactly what was already done. You overreacted by a million. Unless Ezra has issues with PAD or neuropathy, cleaning a bandaging a cut is no different than with anyone else.", "Borderline or bipolar?", "I agree. He's a grown man, he can make his own medical decisions. Why punish his friend over it?", "Ezra would be a good doggo name", "Well yes I do know that, I suppose I'm just confused as to why it was an ER situation and full-on freakout, and not a, \"hey let's maybe hop over to urgent care/your primary doctor tomorrow for a quick look and see if we need antibiotics\"", "I'm a fair bit taller than Nick and I think I'd just suck it up, only two days just sleep curled up. But yeah where are you getting the idea that they hooked up from?", "Of course. Saying something sounds like something isn't a diagnosis. Watching someone drink one time doesn't mean they are an alcoholic but you can still suggest it based on actions and recommend help.", "It honestly feels like she's using the injury as an excuse to take control of her boyfriend back rather than actually caring about the injury itself. It doesn't seem like the boyfriend's diabetes is bad enough to Warrant that kind of behavior. But she is weaponizing the excuse like crazy.", "I was also thinking about insurance because I\u2019d refuse to go the ER for something as dumb as glass in my foot.", "My ex was diagnosised borderline, not bipolar.", "OP sounds like one of those overbearing wife-mothers: why didn't you make sure he takes his pills? you know he can't eat that because of his condition! that's it, I'm taking my baby-husband home, since none of you seem to know how to take care of a 30 year old!", "Because the OP is a control freak.", "I don\u2019t think suggesting actions based on made up scenarios is helpful. At best it\u2019s a random tangent that does nothing to address the problem at hand.", "So was I \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8people like this give the rest of us who try so hard to not be psychos such a bad name.", "100%. Like girl, you are not his care-taker. Know your place.\n\nI honestly think she sounds jealous of them spending time together and found some out-of-pocket reason to make his friend leave."]}
