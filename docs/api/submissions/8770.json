You kicked out the friend because you are jealous of him.  \nI'm also diabetic and I don't rush to the doctor for every cut, much less the emergency room!

Who knows.\n\nNick did his best, but ultimately if it warranted a trip to the ER, that was Ezra's call (I mean, he's the one diabetic, he should know his medical situation).\n\nBut because Nick didn't immediately react how you would, and just patched up your bf, you kicked him out.\n\nThe dots aren't joining up here. From their perspective you sure as hell come across as the AH, and your own reasoning doesn't make it sound any better.\n\nIt just sounds like you're upset that your boyfriend spent more time with his friend (who he hasn't seen in a good while) more than he did with you, especially when you used phrases like \"Nick continued gatekeeping Ezra\". You're making all of this sound like it's all dastardly Nick's fault; twirling his evil moustache as he has his henchman tie your poor helpless, defenseless and blameless damsel Nick to some train tracks, before cutting his feet with glass.\n\nIt honestly sounds like you just don't like Nick and were looking the earliest opportunity to get rid of him.", "YTA \n\n>Nick continued gatekeeping Ezra for the rest of the next day, but honestly I didn\u2019t mind bc I had my own night out with my friends!\n\nI don't think you know what the word gatekeeping means.

If you wish to keep your boyfriend, you're going to have to be a little nicer.", "INFO What?\n\n>We, the 3 of us, immediately went to the ER that morning\n\nWhy?

Bringing diabetes and your dad into this is just silly. Ezra is the one with the condition, it really is his call on how to react to an incident such as this. \n\nIt really does sound like you're just spoiling for a fight because you didn't like being sidelined.

And please explain to us what exactly they did that was immature and irresponsible.", "YTA!! good lord woman, your bf is 29 yrs old, stop treating him like an incapable child. you're his gf, not his mom. i'm sure in all those years of his life, especially with diabetes, he knows how to take care of himself and doesn't need you riding in on your \"knows better than you because muh daddy\" horse. nick and him did just what every other person would do if it wasn't a large wound. not everything needs a trip to the er, no, not even when you are diabetic. \n\npersonally, sounds like you're just pissed because you weren't made the center of your bf's world for one whole day and it's chapping your ass. \n\nnothing about this situation warrants your reactions or feelings. nick is not the bad guy here. you're being irrational, infantilizing and controlling. your BF is not wrong to be beyond annoyed with you and how you are treating everyone. he's probably doing some deep thinking about whether he wants to stay with someone who acts like you are. most people would not be ok with this.", "Sounds like you were trying to find the perfect excuse to blow up. Also sounds like you are very controlling and oblivious to this behaviour. YTA", "NTA\n\nYou sound a little full of yourself, but in this case you were right. And Ezra sounds like he doesn't want to assume his bro/\"fratboy\" times are way in the past.\n\nAsk Ezra to make up his mind. Ether his buddy or you.", "ESH-your bf was rude for gatekeeping and ignoring you. Ezra is an adult and should have taken responsibility for his own health-thats not Nick's responsibility.  You were beyond rude calling Nick a child when your bf was just as bad. You behaved like a child yourself", "Diabetics are at high risk of infections if their feet with even minor wounds.  They are advised to check their feet daily for wounds.  My friend got a small cut on her foot as a teen and parents ignored what doctors told them and just cleaned and bandaged it.  She wound up hospitalized for weeks and nearly lost her foot.", "And what's with the \"I was okay with them spending time together\", why does your bf need you to okay him spending time with his friends?", "Diabetics are at high risk of infections if their feet with even minor wounds.  They are advised to check their feet daily for wounds.  My friend got a small cut on her foot as a teen and parents ignored what doctors told them and just cleaned and bandaged it.  She wound up hospitalized for weeks and nearly lost her foot.\n\nNot saying OP was right about everything, but she wasn\u2019t wrong that the foot needed to be examined.\n\nETA, I agree OP is the AH!  Just saying that foot injuries in diabetics are no joke.  My friend\u2019s parents were told to take her to a wound clinic with any foot wound.  I\u2019m going to ask her if there\u2019s more backstory there though!", "Indeed, she is not *better than Ezra*.", "The way she wrote \"college dropout\" sounded so derisive and elitist as well. You can tell there's definitely some jealousy of their friendship. It's weird that she couldn't just be concerned for her boyfriend's health and safety (which for those poo poo'ing are absolutely valid concerns, btw) without turning it into blaming every damn thing on Nick. How about Nick did the best he could in the moment to apply first aid to his friend, and that's what emergency services would recommend you do first thing, anyway? Miss \"My Dad's A Doctor.\"\n\nOP is petty and resentful and absolutely TA.", "Not only this, but OP isn\u2019t a doctor either. Just a busybody who feels she\u2019s superior and knows best. I don\u2019t blame her bf for being pissed off. Grow up, OP. Lose the holier then thou attitude. YTA", "Yep. Petty and jealous. YTA.", "Diabetes is the difference. Diabetics are gonna need wound care and antibiotics after an injury to the foot. Is it garunteed that it will end up with an amputation if it isn't treated? No. Is there a high likelihood of infection and amputation without proper care yes. Was she a bit bratty about this? Yes she was. But there has to be some latitude given for her responding in the heat of the moment out of concern for someone she loves. \nWhat she needs to do now is apologize for the way she responded.", "Oh snap!  I remember the OP and that guy needs to run!  Maybe he can start a support group with Ezra over here.", "An ER visit for a cut costs $500 over the pond?!\n\nHoly moly, y'all are getting ripped off big time", "Yup. And after a certain period of time...hours.... They wouldn't stitch it anyway, so regardless it's dramatic and it wasn't useful. Presumably the bleeding had stopped, so what was the plan? And why are you throwing diabetes as an excuse to be controlling when the situation was under control?\nYTA", "Op just doesn\u2019t want to admit she desperately wants to gatekeep her bf.\n\nOp, YTA. Your bf is a 28 year old who knows how to take care of himself. His life was not endangered.", "Yes, but OP did say Ezra is diabetic. Foot wounds on diabetics can be extremely dangerous. Maybe not an ER visit, but definitely a doctor's appointment", "Yeah I've lived with diabetics in my family and I was so confused. Like it was properly taken care of and the BF just needs to keep an eye on possible infection. That's the only way this could go possibly bad.", "As someone who has had multiple abusive relationships ships I think I can fill in a little. We don\u2019t see it. We look back at the horrid things we\u2019ve been through and see the situation we\u2019re in as better (even if it\u2019s still abusive and mentally fucked up) just because it\u2019s not as bad as before. He may not even realize it\u2019s abuse because the original abuse he went through played a lot on physical abuse. He may not be able to recognize the mentally and emotionally abusive aspects of the relationship because she\u2019s not screaming every day and trying to tear his door down while fighting.\n\nGoing through and dealing with abuse is draining but when you\u2019ve been through so much worse it\u2019s hard to recognize that just because it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s what we truly deserve, which is no abuse at all.", "I also noticed she never mentioned Nick getting those life-saving stitches while they were at ER. So... they were right all along??", "His diploma maybe\u2026", "Well, I'M university educated.  Doesn't mean I know any more about how to treat a wound than a bartender, because I didn't study anything health related.\n\nI'm also guessing a bartender may have dealt with broken glass and possibly cuts more than I have.", "We have a $7K deductible and $14K out of pocket max - we're not going to the ER unless it's truly an emergency - and a cut that stops bleeding reasonably quickly with standard first aid measures is *not* an emergency.    I would have also cleaned the wound and closed it with steri-strips.", "I wouldn't be surprised if he was trained to deal with broken glass, there again I know jack shit about bartender training so\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "The US is so variable.  Because of my low income \"Medicaid\", when my cat bit and scratched me seriously, I went to my provider's urgent care, waited maybe 15 minutes, got seen by two nurses and a doctor, all with good senses of humor who laughed with me about the cat while cleaning my wounds.  Waited another 10-15 minutes at the pharmacy for meds and left, no charge for anything.   I was thinking the whole time, this is how the system should be for everyone.", "The risk for diabetics is if they have peripheral neuropathy and a wound develops on the foot without the person noticing it.   Ezra was well aware of his cut and able to monitor for signs of poor healing or infection.   The initial treatment is no different than for a non-diabetic person.", "yeah, if they're not taken care of.....which it was when Ezra cleaned and bandaged that wound.   Y'all really think a diabetic person's foot just shrivels up and falls off if you look at it funny.", "I *am* diabetic and was completely dumbfounded by that logic. Definitely one of my bigger WTF moments this week.", "It doesn't seem like the bf needed to go to the hospital. But what I don't understand is how this is the friends fault!? Surely if Ezra is an adult, he can decide not to go to the hospital or not. And OP has an issue with that decision, her issue is with Ezra not the friend.", "My 4th grade Girl Scout knows first aid for a minor cut.   She'd need help with the Steri-Strips but it's not exactly rocket science to control bleeding and clean and dress a wound.", "Again, I\u2019m guessing you aren\u2019t diabetic.", "Ezra does have an underlying condition, he has diabetes. Because of the higher sugar levels minor wounds in diabetic patients can be really hard to heal and can lead to severe infections. Feet are especially vulnerable and amputation of feet or lower legs due to infection that can't be controlled is much more common in diabetic people than the general population. Diabetic patients get it drilled into them that they have to be really really careful about any wounds or injuries to their feet and their feet are regularly checked up on as part of their healthcare.", "I wouldn't use that as a rule. Especially since people have such different thresholds of feeling like they should go to the hospital. I had a bad stomachache but I wasn't sure if I should go to the ER because I thought it might be just food poisoning. I ended up going anyway and it's a good thing I did because I had appendicitis with complications and ended up in emergency surgery and spent a week at the hospital.", "This is horrible advice.  Do not follow this advise.  I went to the ER for what I presumed was acid reflux which had stopped responding to my meds.  Nope, I was having a heart attack.  Glad I didn't think like this about it or I wouldn't be here to tell you how bad that advice is.", "For some things, sure. But this is also how a lot of people die from heart attacks and strokes.", "That\u2019s the exact thought process my coworker had until his appendix burst and he had to get that cleaned up. Then my sister did nearly the exact same thing, and the only reason her appendix didn\u2019t burst is because I made her go to the ER before it happened (and they were able to schedule her an appointment for the next morning). I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s a piece of advice I\u2019m going to take.", "Ehh, don't tell that to someone with appendicitis.", "This is really bad advice and actually really pisses me off you'd say that. YTA for spreading misinformation. I was having chest pain one night that wasn't too bad and only went to the emergency because my friend said I should in case and I ended up having a heart attack at 24. If you have to ask if you should go to the ER you should ALWAYS go. If you have a cut that stops bleeding on its own and you can properly disinfect it, no you probably don't need to go.", "Also the fact you're trying to say you meant it differently and multiple people are telling you that's not how it reads and you're still arguing with them makes me sick. You'd rather people read what you said and be more afraid to go get treated than admit you're wrong and help people be safe. Just sad being right is more important to you than other people's health.", "This is possibly the worst advice I have seen on here.", "It\u2019s seriously important.  They are highly prone to infections in the foot.  A friend of mine had a minor cut on her foot as a teenager and her parents blew it off despite what the doctors said.  She ended up hospitalized for weeks and nearly lost her foot.", "Diabetics have trouble healing. While it's good to catch the cut; probably because the friend saw blood, many diabetics have neuropathy, so have less feeling in their feet and also generally have trouble healing.\n\nEDIT: Source diabetic", "I take care of my diabetic dad - pretty much anytime he gets any sort of cut on his foot, no matter how small, no matter how well we take care of it, he gets cellulitis. There's no harm in taking extra precautions. We've dealt with too much in the past. If you've dealt with it, even noticing just the smallest cut makes our hearts drop", "Yeah, to my knowledge, a cut on the foot doesn\u2019t equal immediate emergency amputation for a diabetic. It means, is it clean? Is it bandaged? Is it healing? If yes, continue what you\u2019re doing. If no, go to your pcp.", "No kidding.", "I just recently heard a story about someone who was knocked off a horse, was walking around with just some pain, but turned out to have a broken back! I was astonished. Didn\u2019t know that was possible.", "When I was a kid(super skinny, not anymore), I'd hook my fingers underneath my ribcage and pull my ribs outward to have more breathing room. I didn't realize until I was in college that I had asthma. \ud83e\udee0\n\nMy dad waited until an infection got so bad he was unable to move/see because of it, and even then he only went to the hospital because Mom made him.\n\nHave a grandpa who has several times collapsed and gotten a bad fever and tried to refuse to go to the hospital. Also a few times when he broke bones and tried to avoid the hospital. Don't worry, I dragged him there.\n\nIt very much depends on the individual.", "Yeah, reminds me of the time I walked home 2km on a dislocated ankle that also had a hairline fracture. Got home and verified it was still warm, normal color and had good capillary refill. Then I hobbled up a flight of steps, got myself an ice pack, & waited on the couch with ice on it for 3 hours for my parents to get home at 16 because \"I didn't wanna call an ambulance if it's not an emergency\". \n\nI'm was a rural farm kid & child of an ER doc, can you tell? \n\nMy parents' response when they got home was (after they stopped laughing at me and called me an idiot a few different ways), \"listen if your leg's got more joints than it should, that's an emergency worth calling an ambulance for, ok?\" \n\nAs for how I managed to get home on it: 1, my hiking boot fortunately was sturdy enough it acted like a brace and 2, I lived out in the back of beyond and was seeing coyote eye reflections in the woods as it got dark. Adrenaline is a *fantastic* pain killer. Honestly, I knew my ankle felt floppy and wrong but I didn't realize how much damage I'd done till I got my boot off and saw the deformity. I had no pain at all until I got home and settled on the couch and then my brain was like \"Oh hey we're safe! Good. So, uh, you realize your ankle's fucked, right? No? Here have a sensation like a thousand hot pokers stabbing as a little alien monster is trying to chew it's way out of your ankle! You know it's fucked, now, yeah?\" \n\nGenerally for me the amount of whining I do is inversely proportional to the severity of the health problem. If I'm quiet and still, that's when you need to worry. I never shut up or sit still unless I'm absorbed in something,  asleep, or dying.", "Most of my family is the suck it up and suffer in silence types. I have so many stories of their dumbassery", "People are weird. My theory is either they're really bored sitting alone on a Friday night, the bar closed, or they just got paid so they figured they'll get it taken care of."]}
