{"id": 30400, "submission_id": "17okfuz", "title": "AITA (36M) for checking on and visiting my wife (39F)", "selftext": "I'm married with a few kids. My wife is a medical provider. Long story short I barely see her.\n\nTonight she was out with some friends. 2am rolls around and I text her and ask if she's coming home tonight (I was planning on leaving early morning for a separate thing). I text our mutual friend she's with and ask\"where's my wife\" because this is how she and I talk. When either of us asks about my wife we'll refer to her as such or simply as \"her\" as a kind of short hand. Wife then responds she's driving. Ok cool.\n\n45 minutes goes by and she's not back. For context, she was coming from a place 25 minutes away. She was driving through areas known for deer and drunk drivers.\n\nSo I text her again to ask if she's ok, no response. Call, no response. Few more minutes go by. Then I text the following:\n\nIt's not a 45 minute drive is everything ok\n\nMy wife then calls me and blows up at me. Accusing me of checking up on her and basically being up her ass. I was extremely taken aback by this.\n\nShe also had an issue with my word choice of \"where's my wife\" and \"it's not a 45 minute drive\" she took that as possessive and overbearing. I didn't mean it as such at all.\n\nAlso, here's why her job is relevant; every now and then I stop by briefly with a snack or drink for her to say hi and just let her knows I'm thinking of her even if I don't see her. Her love language is acts of service. We've had some problems so I've just been trying to show her I care through actions (what she says she responds to).\n\nShe then throws THAT in my face, saying people at work ask if I don't trust her and again that I'm checking up on her. Please keep in mind up until this moment she's always seemed receptive and appreciate of my stopping by for a moment and clearly thinking of her.\n\nBut then she twisted that into something negative. I mean, I barely ever see you and I'm trying to make this work and show you I care and you throw it in my face. I miss her, flat out. I told her this and I told her that even if I don't get to briefly see her when I stop in just the chance I might is reason enough to make the drive.\n\nAgain, just threw it in my face as I'm being overbearing. \n\nI don't think I was unreasonable being concerned about her tonight, and I'm very deeply hurt that my stopping by sometimes to say hi, which she says she appreciates, has really been taken as this negative thing and thrown in my face.\n\nI wrote her a letter explaining this and apologizing if she took offense to my word choices as that wasn't my intention. I slipped it under her door (we're sleeping separately tonight, she told me to stay the fuck away from her and I responded in kind). It's the middle of the night so we'll see what happens.", "created_utc": 1699214846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17okfuz/aita_36m_for_checking_on_and_visiting_my_wife_39f/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I see it completely reasonable to text your WIFE at 2 am to check in on her. My wife would\u2019ve turned her location on so I could see that she\u2019s still on her way. Not for any reason like being possessive or anything. That\u2019s just what married spouses do imo. For her to have that reaction seems a little suspicious to me.", "So you barely see your wife. She goes out tonight and is still out at 2am. You can\u2019t get ahold of her. You text a friend that is supposed to be with her. Then your wife finally responds. That she is driving?   Then  takes another 45 minutes or longer to get home. When she gets home she is very confrontational.   \n\n1) why is your wife doing out when you rarely see each other.  And staying out until 3am?\n\n2) how wasn\u2019t you could get ahold of her. But her friend could. Her texting you she is driving. Suggest she was not with her friend.  \n\n3) it took longer than the 25 minutes to get home, because she was not where she said he was and was further away.where ever she was,  was an hour away. \n\n4). She is gaslighting you, trying to get you to focus on something else.  \n\n\nSince you rarely see her, why didn\u2019t she invite you to meet her out. \nBeing labeled as overbearing, controlling or insecure.  Are just shaming tactics to try and get you to back down. At my age, my wife can stay out all night if she wants to. I won\u2019t stop her. But divorce would be the next conversation we would have. And most of that conversation would be between lawyers", "NTA - Those who find your concern are puzzling.  She was late, it's normal to be worried and check in to make sure she is okay (for all you know she could have gotten into an accident).  \n\nUnless she told you she was uncomfortable with you stopping by work, there's nothing wrong with it.  It was a sweet gesture.  Only if she told you to stop and you refused could it be considered controlling and possessive.\n\nSomething is going on with her.  Her reactions aren't rational.  You commented that you tried therapy, but she now refuses to go. That's a huge red flag.  At a certain point you need to stop apologizing for something you don't need to apologize for, set boundaries, and let her know at what point there is no going forward together (that is only something you can decide).", "NTA\n\nBut based on this I think the marriage is as good as over if not over already:\n\n>I'm married with a few kids. My wife is a medical provider. Long story short I barely see her.  \n>  \n>Tonight she was out with some friends. 2am rolls around and I text her and ask if she's coming home tonight (I was planning on leaving early morning for a separate thing). \n\nYou barely see each other but she goes out partying with friends until the early hours when you have to go somewhere the next day, you'd might kind of hope she'd want to be spending time with you.\n\nYou've got several kids and you're travelling early, you'd hope she'd be contacting you to let you know when she's getting back so that a) you don't worry and b) just in case childcare needed to be aranged. If she's drinking until 2am or later is she going to be in any fit state to take care of the kids.", "NTA But if you can't put in the work to make the marriage work, you should seek counseling. I'm probably in the minority, I don't think she's cheating, but rather might be in a bit of a funk. Has she been a medical professional since before Covid or during?", "Let\u2019s check back on this in a few months. My bet is that he will find out that she\u2019s cheating on him, sadly\u2026", "NTA for wanting to know where your wife is at 2:00 AM.  But you need to read the writing on the wall.  She's being cold, distant and for telling you to stay the fuck away from her, that's just downright disrespectful.  Time to think about divorce.  It's coming.  Good luck.", "She\u2019s cheating on you bro", "Info: Do you actually check up on her, do you have suspicions? Are you overbearing?", "NTA but this marriage is over, she sounds like she's checked out.", "INFO: what are the problems that you've both had? I think it matters here.", "She has karaoke, guitar lessons and band practice plus kids? Sounds like she wants to be the rock star and you stay home with the kids.", "NTA \nBeen there - healthcare worker spouse, sketchy absences / time-voids, defensive / attacking reactions legitimate concern for their wellbeing (bc the thought that they were up to no good never even crossed my mind)\u2026 the whole bit. \n\nIn my case - she was cheating with a co-worker. \n\nNot saying that\u2019s the case for you and your wife; but I\u2019d suggest looking into things further, on the down-low, rather than just assuming you did something wrong/ offensive.", "NTA (for this case only; I can see how in some circumstances this would feel a bit overbearing). She came home at 3AM at the earliest, when she knows you're leaving early in the morning. I don't know if she had to work the next day, but that would give me a weird feeling if my bf were out that late and knew I was leaving that early the next morning. I don't know how old your children are, so I don't know what sort of help they need in the morning. I don't know when bars close near you, either. It's the combo of those factors with her lying about her drive home that give me bad feelings about her. And I read your comments; she used to appreciate you leaving a little snack for her at work and suddenly she's angry about that. I'd feel uneasy if someone I loved behaved like this all of a sudden as well.", "I think this is more of a NAH but everyone is just stressed and misreading each other.", "I would feel weird if my husband randomly checked up on me at work. INFO: does your wife encourage the work visits? Unclear if she's been thinking you were overbearing for a while or if she's just drunk", "Meh. She's cheating to me. Nta", "NTA. She seems paranoid and ungrateful.", "NTA. Wife is acting shady. Maybe you do come off as overbearing sometimes to her, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask where she is at 2am. Sounds like she wasn\u2019t where she said she would be.", "Nta \nShe\u2019s cheating and defensive and deflecting. Get a life of your own and stop chasing and sitting at home desperate for crumbs when someone might be out there with the whole cake.", "Nta. She's flipping the script right now to hide something.", "She definitely has a side relationship", "Wasn't this exact same thing posted yesterday...?", "She is doing some sketchy shit.", "NTA\n\nShe is no longer your wife. She is now some random dudes girlfriend. My condolences.", "I am a doctor as well, and had a marriage that went down the drain in a very similar fashion. So this is biased opinion, but I think although you're NTA, chances are your marriage is done for as far as I see it.\n\nHe wanted to spend time with me, did acts of service, and was generally quite supportive of my work and interests. But over the years I increasingly felt 1) guilty for not making the time for him and 2) like his acts of love and care were overbearing or even manipulative, in order to guilt me into dropping the things I liked to be with him.\n\nIt turns out that I just didn't love him, and although I had brought myself to that conclusion on a few occasions, I dismissed it, especially because I felt guilty towards all his \"unrepayed kindness\" and selfish.\n\nIn the end it was him who called it quits. I was initially shocked and heartbroken. But I assure you that I very quickly it was one of the best, most liberating things in my life. I was being bribed into \"love\", and the truth is I could never give him the love he wanted because, well, it was never there to begin with.\n\nAll luck to you, OP, and try to be honest with yourself on whether you're barking up the right tree.", "Soft YTA. Try leaving her the heck alone. Don't text when she's out, don't call when the texts aren't answered, and don't write letters and slip them under her door. Just let her be out and have fun (you can't stop her from hitting a deer or whatever). And use her name when you text about her. It doesn't take any longer. But most of all, don't try to have sane logical conversations with an upset person at 3 AM who's probably been drinking, Just wait for the next day.", "I\u2019d say NAH, seems to be a misunderstanding. But there\u2019s also smth you should consider here:\n\nAs a woman I appreciate you try to show your love and concern for her, which when misread could be taken as being controlling. You say it\u2019s not like that, and hasn\u2019t to be, but for God\u2019s sake, *pay attention to how this makes her feel*. Relationships aren\u2019t all about how we think the other one will take our gestures, but about how the other one actually feels about them. So if she says you\u2019re overwhelming her and she feels controlled, even if she isn\u2019t right, let her take a breath instead of writing letters, man. \n\nSame goes for her. She should consider how this disconnection times make you feel, so whenever everything is calmed, you let her have her space, sit down and calmly chat about how you feel. Just like you would do with a close friend. And try to reach a middle point. \n\nAll the best.", "> I text our mutual friend she's with and ask\"where's my wife\" because this is how she and I talk. \n\nYTA.\n\nShe told you you\u2019re being overbearing so then you write a note and slip it under her door? \n\nListen to what she is saying about how you\u2019re making her feel. \n\nIf this really is an issue of her job taking up so much time in her life that your marriage is suffering, that\u2019s a conversation that you should have with each other calmly. \n\nChecking up on her through her friends and showing up at her workplace are not acceptable. She doesn\u2019t want you to do that so stop doing that.", "ESH. My read on your actions, as someone outside your marriage, is that they feel overbearing and possessive. \n\nFor instance, how much time went be between when you first text her (at 2) and when you texted her friend? Your wording also leaves a LOT to be desired...maybe it's 'how you talk' but you need to keep in mind that tone does not come across in text very well. \n\nI have the sense things have deteriorated between you and in better circumstances, this might have been a non-issue between you. You shouldn't have had to wonder when she'd be home to begin with - had she let you know when to expect her?  Checking up on your SO when they're out unexpectedly long past midnight is reasonable. \n\nIt's surprising to me that it is seen as appropriate for you to pop into a medical office, unexpectedly, on multiple occasions. So from your perspective it's just a sweet gesture but I can definitely see why it has made her uncomfortable - BUT she should be communicating to you about that rather than letting the irritation build up and bubble over. \n\nYou mention 'threw it in my face' a lot in this post. I don't think you're coming at this from a compassionate frame of mind; this is written to make her look bad and you look sympathetic. I think you should get to couples' therapy.", "Wtf is your wife doing out at 2 am.  That\u2019s your real problem.", "Based purely on your account of the scenario I'd say NTA. My partner and I share our locations with each other 24/7 and do check up on each other if it's super late. We don't lash out at each other, we understand the other person is concerned and probably annoyed that they're going to get a disturbed sleep. We don't visit each other's workplace but that doesn't sound like an AH thing to do. \n\nHowever something feels off here in your situation that I can't put my finger on which makes me question the AH-edness", "NTA (but I do think her coworkers are the a-holes). Why does she care so much what they think when their opinion about the relationship is obviously wrong? Does she ever actually correct them and stand up for the relationship when they make assumptions? Are the assumptions of her coworkers making her hate the simple gestures that she used to love? And I think it was fair for you to want to know what time she'd be home and where she was before you went to bed. Its not being overbearing to at least know the parameters of where your partner is if you live together. While boundaries should always be respected, not all boundaries are necessarily VALID. I broke up with a friend that couldn't talk to me over text without being triggered by every little change in my mood or timeframe or word usage. Said it made him feel unwanted. And I always tried to respect his boundary of not changing my texts too much but I'm still a person. I will have off days or will be too busy to respond in a \"timely manner\" according to him. Exhausting. Point is, feelings should be respected but they aren't always rational or healthy. We're all human and care about and worry about the ones we love. Its tough being with a nurse but its even tougher *being* a nurse. Her job will always be the biggest and most exhausting priority and you will have to support her in any way you can. HOWEVER it seems she's so overwhelming that she's taking it out on you and suddenly has a problem with everything you're doing. Give her space like she is asking for and reconnect when you're both cooled off.", "Yta. Do you think it's not mal to stop by someone's place of work this often. \nAnd you said you were sorry IF she took offense to your word choices. \n\nNo apologise for using offe so e word choices which hurt her feelings. \n\nWhat you gave was a non apology.", "She\u2019s probably pissed because the blowjob she was giving some random in the parking lot kept getting interrupted by her phone going off.\n\nBe better.

You shouldn't be slipping notes under her door to apologise, if it's exactly as you said you did nothing wrong.\n\nDon't ask where she is, don't check in on her at work any more. Just crack on with your own stuff for a while, let her have her fun, see if she comes around. If not, it's going to be better to be out of it than the only one in it. But you could probably do with some space to figure out if this is what you want.", "Op I hope you see this comment. You're going to have to toughen up right about now. What your wife is doing is picking an argument with you to distract from the fact that she is incredibly in the wrong. Stop apologizing. Rational people will check on their partners at any hour when they expect them to be home at a certain hour. So you calling and texting her is what any rational minded, concerned and caring person  would do. I think you dropping things off at her job (the food) is extremely sweet considering that you hardly see her. Personally if I was in a high demanding job that took a lot of my day and my partner or hubby popped in to just bring me something  I'd smile everytime. Now here's some harsh reality. You are the only one trying to make this relationship work. I'm getting a sense that she hasn't left you or filed for divorce because she doesn't want to seem like the bad guy breaking up your family since I see you mentioned you guys have kids. Seeing as how she refuses therapy unless you are being vilified says a lot. I can't tell you what to do but you will have to determine for yourself how much longer you can take being emotionally abused. Your wife mentally has checked out of your marriage. I am sorry. Your are NTA on any level", "Going against the grain and saying ESH.\n\nBut everybody _mildly_ sucks here. Like a softcore porno. Or a vacuum that needs repairs.\n\nShe shouldn't have blasted you like that. There are more productive ways to convey that information.\n\nBut I think it's oftentimes frowned upon to visit your spouse at work with that level of frequency. In addition, texting her when she's out with her friends is encroaching on her \"[third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)\". If she has to see you at home, sometimes at work, and has you trying to reign her in when she's doing fun stuff, how on earth can she possibly miss you?\n\nYou do sound possessive.
