Our relationship is turbulent, but we get along well as much as possible. She is seriously dating a guy, \"Jack\", and my relationship with him is terrible, we fight a lot. Jack always comes to our house complaining that I'm not doing anything, that I should be helping with the chores around the house, that I'm already an adult, that I'm antisocial, he's insufferable.\n\nI'd like to point out that I help around the house, but for him, if my mom is cooking when he comes here and I'm in my room? it's wrong, I'm being lazy and ungrateful.\n\nRecently, my mom started talking about how she wanted to live with Jack, but he didn't want to live with me, and maybe it was time for me to move out. I have internet, and I know that, as a guardian, she has an obligation to provide me with a roof over my head. She keeps repeating that she wants to live with him and I just ignore it.  \n\nJack tho, came over on Friday and told me that I had to leave the house, that they would do me a favor and pay for rent while I look for work but that I had to leave, and I said no, that if they do that I'll go straight to the police, the fireman, I don't care, and I'll report them (I have no idea how the police would respond, but the internet says it's illegal, so I believe it).\n\nHe got really mad and told me I need to act like an adult and give my mom some space, but I don't trust them enough to pay the rent anyway. My cousins \u200b\u200bagree with me, they said that I need to start working and save for when I'm 18 but that until then, my mother can make do with her boyfriend, but my aunts and uncles are saying that I'm an asshole, that my mother wants to live her life and be happy, that in a little while I'm going to leave anyway, and that I'm doing some silly revenge just because I don't like Jack. And my mom keeps complaining that I know how much she loves Jack, and I'm still refusing to move, that it's not going to change my life at all, that I'm such an asshole for knowing how much this is affecting her and not caring or trying to help.

She could still live with Jack in the same house. But if the situation is getting bad, maybe talk to some form of social worker what your options are. In some countries parents also have to pay for their children after 18 if the children go to a university. Maybe a social worker can give you tips or help you to get a contract with your mother that says she has to legally pay a place for you to stay. A small flat might be worth more than a creapy home.

I would also cut contact for good.", "NTA, and you may want to look at your area's laws on \"emancipated minors,\" in which you can be granted adult status under the law.

You are a MINOR CHILD. \n\nYou can't get a lease because you are under 18. You can't even rent a hotel room. And right now, rentals are at an all time high. No way a 16 year old could find work to cover the rent on even a studio apartment.

Make sure you report any/every infraction and don't let them start edging you out. She has to support you until you are 18. NTA", "NTA- what planet am I on right now? Your mom sounds horrible. I cannot imagine saying ANY of this to my child.", "Your mom, her boyfriend, and your entire family sucks ass.  Stay till you are 18.  Save your money.  Get the fuck out on your 18th and never speak to them again.\n\nPlus you may want to stop helping at all.  Your getting accused of it anyhow and it is illegal for them to kick you out.  So fuck em.", "NTA - call child protective services for help.", "NTA. Tell them you'll gladly move out when they sign an apartment lease, furnish the apartment and give you two years worth  expenses in cash which you will immediately put in a bank account in your own name. Seriously you need some back up. Talk to your teachers, find relatives that are on your side etc. Tell people that if you go missing they should look into your mother's boyfriend. Start documenting every comment about moving out.", "NTA. And do call the police if they kick you out. You\u2019re still a minor. Your mom is terrible for choosing a guy over her own daughter.", "WTF?\n\nNTA\n\nYou are in a terrible situation.  Foster care sucks. I think you can declare independence with a judge, and they will take the money from her accounts to give to you. She has a responsibility. She is failing you. And I think living with Jack sounds unsafe.\n\nStay in school! Get help from a guidance counselor or take courses at a community college.  \n\nLive well! It is the best revenge.", "Nta - ask your mom why she can't just move in with Jack and keep paying the bills there for you? Just shows you what a total loser Jack is.  If she wanted to just live her life then she never should have had kids to be legally obligated to take care of.\n\nGo tell your school counselor asap. Ask for any assistance possible now. Get it on record that they are trying to kick you out!\n\nAnd remind her that she can't move Jack in if she is in jail for child abuse and neglect! She can wait 2 years.", "Yeah this isn\u2019t entirely true. In states like California, if you\u2019re in foster care when you turn 18 you\u2019re entitled to services, housing, etc. until age 25. I would do some research.", "Would like to add- if in the US if you are still in school and turn 18 say in the beginning of the year- your mom is still legally required to support you u till you graduate. I know this because EX tried to say \u201cno child support\u201d kid is 18. Was told they would have to pay till graduation", "Did you know when you turn 18 that they have to formally evict you?  They can\u2019t just kick you out.  Also, \u201cact like an adult\u201d F THAT NOISE.  Your a kid.  You mom sucks.  It\u2019s her job to protect you.  Also, yes get a job and start saving.  You mom/aunts/ uncles are awful.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you need to get allies on your side, maybe a school counsellor or trusted teacher. Your Mom and  her BF are acting like children, but she has a responsibility to provide for you. Your cousins are right and you should start working and saving every penny because the moment you turn 18 your Mom will likely cut all financial support.", "NTA\n\nCall the police. Your mother has a responsibility to you. Not him. He has no right to order you to leave.", "Get your personal documents (birth certificate, social security card, etc) and hide that too.", "Oh honey. NTA. You\u2019re 16. You\u2019re nearly an adult but you\u2019re not. You\u2019re still a child. This is abuse by your mother. \n\nI\u2019m appalled at your aunts and uncles. \n\nYour mother may think 16 is close enough to being an adult because she had you so young but she\u2019s wrong. \n\nI have no idea what to suggest but my heart is breaking for you.", "NTA... it is time to get law enforcement involved.  Explain to them that your mom and boyfriend keep telling you to leave. Ask if there is any resources you can access or if anyone is willing to explain to them that they have legal obligation to look after you. \n\nAnd I am sorry. Your mom is an AH. And the family that agree with her are the same. You deserve better", "Holy moly NTA. I\u2019m sorry this is happening! Your mother is failing you.", "NTA tell your mom she better stay saving up for her retirement home because she should do you the favor that way you can live your life and be happy so you don't have to worry about her when she gets old. Or that her boyfriend better be loaded so you don't have to send her a cent when she's struggling when you're gone, because she's making her choice picking D over her kid.", "NTA", "NTA you are still legally a child, it is your mother's responsibility to care for you. I suspect the boyfriend will take advantage of her. Will any of your relatives take you in? Your school counselor might be a good adult to consult", "NTA. Go no contact when you do leave, but drag them through hell now. You deserve so much better, I\u2019m sorry they\u2019ve failed you.", "Your mom is definitely responsible for housing and feeding you.", "Oh my GOD. I\u2019m so sorry your family is filled with abusive, neglectful assholes. You are a child, you didn\u2019t ask to be here and your mother OWES you until you are 18. She is sick in the head, casting her 16 yr old daughter to the streets for a MAN. NTA", "Oh god, all the adult people in your life are failing you on a catastrophic level. NTA. Is there anyone in your life who would be a responsible adult you could stay with?", "NTA\n\nPlease talk to a teacher, a counselor, your doctor, *any* mandated reporter.  This is a big deal and the situation needs oversight.  Your cousins are right that you can't trust her to provide what you need.\n\nThis doesn't sound like a situation where you can go to your father's for your safety as some kids might be able to, and it sounds like you really can't trust your aunts and uncles either.\n\nTry to secure your identity documents.  They should be in your sole possession though I understand that's tough when you still live at home.  But they need to be somewhere you can grab them on a moment's notice.  If you're American that means your social security card, birth certificate, and your current state ID or drivers license.  Any equivalents if you're somewhere else.\n\nAre there *any* adult relatives you can trust?  Even someone like a young adult cousin who's out on their own?  Do any of your friends have parents you *know* you can trust not to go to your mother with anything you tell them, or who can put you up temporarily if your mother kicks you out?", "NTA. OP I am so incredibly sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. You are a child and you deserve so much more than the bare minimum of having a roof over your head. You are not a burden and your mom is a selfish monster.", "Law student here. I just spent a semester doing legal research on the emancipation of a child. If you're in the US and plan on going to college, your parent MUST take care of you in all their capacity until you're 26! Blew my mind! They have to pay for housing, school, food, you name it. You can even take your parent to court and have it court ordered. You're mom is TA and her bf is an even bigger one. Your family sounds awful too. Take her for what she has until you're 26. You deserve it for putting up with this shit. Also NTA", "NTA \n\nFor your sake:\n\n- Develop a reputation as a good person to live with.  This is going to matter a lot between 18 and 30, and it will take time.  \n\n- Parents often find disharmony more uncomfortable than teenagers.  It pays to pick your battles. \n\n- You may be able to sit down privately with your mother and work on a list of chores you are each doing around the house.  It\u2019s common for both people to be surprised by how much work the other already does. Some good options for chore swapping may come up.  \n\n- If you often fill her in on what you have done and what you\u2019re working on before he comes over, she can correct misconceptions and prevent fights before they start.\n\n- If you\u2019re doing around 1 hour a week worth of work on weekdays and 2 on weekends, you\u2019ll probably be matching her contribution and you may be bringing more to the table than he does\u2026 unless he contributes significantly to rent or is much more of a charmer than he sounds like. \n\n- It may be helpful to pick something that he can pick on which is advantageous to you.  For example, if you need a reason for more homework or work time, you can admit you were avoiding going to the library or staying after school to finish.  If he pounces on that, he\u2019s looking for a fight, and you can let him win that one. \n\n- Either paid work or an internship would be very useful right now.  It takes at least a year to get to a decent hourly wage. \n\n- Great grades are a good way to get family members on your side, and they also make it easier to get money to live on during school from the school.", "Tell Mom you\u2019ll consider moving out if she covers the costs and pays you that money in a lump sum in advance.  Her boyfriend telling you they would pay rent until you find a job is not on the table.  You are a minor and you don\u2019t need a job to support yourself. \n\nLook into rentals, transportation to school, groceries, utilities. Clothes year round and medical insurance, haircuts, etc.  and that\u2019s the \u201csupport.\u201d", "You're NTA here. I don't know where you live, but I'm a criminal attorney in the US and I can tell you they would charge her with child neglect at the very least if she forced you to move out while you're an unemancipted minor. \n\nI might talk to your school counselor or your doctor and see what they recommend. You don't deserve to have someone essentially verbally abusing you at home.", "This. OP, I would reach out to CPS, teachers, counselors, whoever. I would call ANY sympathetic family members and let them know what's going on. BUT, I'd also be prepared to move out at 18. Your mom... is not a great person.", "Too many. My niblings\u2019 mother chose their CSA stepfather over them. I wouldn\u2019t cross the street to spit on her if she was on fire. She also had another child with him but is being closely monitored by the authorities.", "And your A H mother and her bf will make for an outstanding application essay.", "Yes OP please find a trusted adult outside of your family!!! You need and deserve support.", "OP replied that they don\u2019t know who their father is", "I wish I had an award for you!! OP exactly this", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to make it easy for her to abandon you by agreeing with her plan. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck there for a few more years.", "NTA It's a messed up, sad world where a 16 year old kid is being told by adult relatives that they are an AH for not letting their mom abandon them on the street so she can get some d**k!! I'm so sorry you're dealing with this OP. Your mom should be doing everything in her power to provide & take care of you until AT LEAST 18!", "NTA im assuming 18 is the legal age in your country and you're still in high school at 16 because thats definitely fucked up for a grown adult to kick u out so that he can have some lovely nights with your mom under the sheets. Please dont be afraid to report him and contact CPS, your rights are being violated\n\n\"He got really mad and told me I need to act like an adult\" ...they're in their 30s whats wrong with these people", "NTA, so much. You\u2019re 16, she has a legal responsibility to care for you. I see she had you when she was a teen. As a young mother myself, I love you, and I\u2019m so sorry she\u2019s doing this to you. One day she will realize the mess she made, and you won\u2019t be there. All my love to you sweet baby.", "NTA. In addition to all the other advice you received, get a lock for your day. Lock ot when you leave the house and lock it when you go to sleep at night.", "\u201cMother\u201d is a pretty loose term for a person who would force their daughter to move out for their arsehole boyfriend. I\u2019m so sorry your mother is failing you. She\u2019s showing you her true colours. Get a job, save you butt off. Hide the money well because you know what\u2019s going to happen the moment you turn 18. Your mothers actions are beyond despicable.", "NTA - You need to make the school aware of your situation with your mom and her boyfriend.

Youre still a minor, and have every right to stay there until 18. That doesn't mean they won't go out of their way to make your life miserable in the meantime though.\n\nGet a PO box from the post office when you get your job. It will give you a safe place to send mail until you get out of the house and have a stable address.\n\nIndeed.com is a great place to find work in your local area and nearby towns. Another place to go is the local DHS office, which can help you with emergency shelter, food stamps and help looking for work if your mom kicks you out. They put homeless people at the top of the waiting list for housing, esp homeless teens.\n\nGather camping and survival gear in case they kick you out and ask friends or other family if you can stay with them too.", "\nI am sorry you are living in a hostile home.\n\nWould suggest you check with grandparents or aunts for a room but your extended family also sucks.\nNTA", "Cash is too easily stolen op. Bank account in your name only that she can't access would be best. I was able to get one on my own at 16, so if one bank refuses go ask another."]}
