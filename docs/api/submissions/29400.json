Also, it\u2019s just peas", "I need to know what this is.  I\u2019ve literally never heard of it", "That is what I do when I make 7 layer salad. I put the frozen peas in a colander and pour boiling water over it and let them drain very well. And it works great.", "You'd be peas-ed off.", "This salad is ridiculously popular in the Midwest.

Woa, haha, that's wild!", "To be fair it\u2019s not necessarily the peas I\u2019d take issue with, it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re not cooked. There was a listeria outbreak linked to frozen veg in the UK some years ago - eating it uncooked is not the best idea.\n\nAnyway that aside I wouldn\u2019t want the mayo and sugar with them either \ud83d\ude02", "Well, it is a salad. Lettuce, mayo with sugar is the \"dressing,\" then peas, celery, bell pepper maybe?, bacon, and cheese. It's not a healthy salad, but it contains the core components.", "Usually the only green food they consume is lime Jello.", "Oh that is scary! I doubt I would have ever eaten this salad again anyway, but now I have better reasons to avoid it at least.", "Ahh, okay! Thanks for giving more info (not from the US). I haven't heard of this, so the few ingredients listed (mayo, sugar, peas) weren't reading as salad.", "Lol I figured that was the case. A mayo and pea \"salad\" would be gross.", "I'm in the US and had no idea what the ingredients might be. That it was 7 layers gave me some idea of where it might originate from, but still no idea of what could be in it.\n\nAlso, some places call something a \"salad\" and I have no idea why other than the fact that they have several different ingredients. Jell-O/gelatin salad is a dessert for some folks. Chicken, tuna, or seafood salads are sandwiches for some (I'm one of them, but haven't thought about the \"salad\" aspect until this moment.) \n\nSo I guess if it's not hot and has a bunch of ingredients mixed together, it's a salad? Otherwise it's a casserole? And now I'm wondering if a layered salad is a salad or a cold potentially veggie lasagne without pasta (or with, I've had both)? I'm just calling everything I bring elsewhere \"food\" from now on. \"Here is food, here's what's in it...\"", "My mom made a \u201cpea salad\u201d that had cheese in it. Maybe onion? I sure wish I could remember or find a recipe.  It was SOOOoo good.  Miracle Whip? Possibly.", "Hell I have been seeing videos on social media of \"candy salad\" where people fill a bowl with different kinds of candies.", "Oh I've had that before too. Peas and those little pearl onions right? We always used mayo.", "It was so good.  And mom was \u201cfamous\u201d for it.", "Well I just did some googling and no recipe used mayo lol. I never made the salad myself... But it looks like just butter and flour so the creaming.
