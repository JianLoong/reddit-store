Oh I know. Because that\u2019s a girly thing to do and people are implicitly misogynistic no matter how much they pretend not to be, so of course they\u2019re gonna see you as the AH for imposing your stupid, shallow, female desires on a poor innocent man!

Contrary to what people are saying in the comments, there\u2019s no valid reason to be sooo uncomfortable with just wearing pink, and they\u2019re only expecting you to brush your feelings aside about this because again, it\u2019s a girly thing you want to do. But you\u2019re also the AH for cancelling the date outright. I know you said you both cancelled it but I think you could have done a better job at reassuring him that it will still be fun, you\u2019re just a bit disappointed. After all he still agreed to see the movie with you, and it\u2019s definitely an overreaction to not go at all because he\u2019s refusing to do one thing to make you happy when he\u2019s already doing the main event for you to be happy.\n\nEdit to add: people need to stop saying \u201cwell if the roles were reversed everyone would call the guy controlling!\u201d These hypothetical reversed scenarios people are conjuring up are not situations where a guy asks a girl to say, wear a blue shirt. Like let\u2019s be for real lol. When you imagine a situation where a guy is accused of being controlling for telling a girl what to wear, do you imagine a guy asking a girl to wear a certain color of clothing? No, you probably imagine a guy telling a girl to wear something sexy or to wear something explicitly not sexy.
