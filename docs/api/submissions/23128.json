If he's not willing to do these little things how's he going to act for something that really matters. It's not like she's regularly asking for him to wear certain clothes, it's a one time thing. NTA", "If she wants to go dressed in pink as a couple, and he doesn\u2019t want to dress in pink, she is more than welcome to not go. If this dude is so insecure that he can\u2019t wear a pink shirt for two hours in a dark room so his gf can get one picture together in pink then maybe he shouldn\u2019t be dating someone straight out of college as a 27 year old. \n\n\u201cAnD yOuR pOiNt Is NeGaTeD.\u201d Not sure what you\u2019re talking about here, but all I can picture is that neckbeard from South Park meme.", "I actually agree with your comment as well so that makes the mistake worse xx", "I just realized they were a woman defending this shit. Wtf", "what happened to my body my choice???", "I think a movie about ice lollies being \u201creally important\u201d to someone would also be rather odd.", "Yes and people buy things don\u2019t like them and instead of throwing them away they let them rot (could give them to people in need, but people often times dont like giving away used clothes).\n\nJust because u arent doing it doesnt mean no one does it", "I own clothes I dont wear. Deal with  it.", "Lmao I'm a woman, but roll as you will. Your point's negated because, like I said, they're going to the dang movies, not a party or dress-up event. \n\n You're right, she's certainly welcome to go with others. I'm just saying that she shouldn't get mad at her boyfriend just because he doesn't want to dress up to go to the movies. It's just a petty hill to die on. There's nothing wrong feeling insecure in certain clothes. I'm insecure when my stomach shows, but that doesn't make me a bad person.", "He is wearing clothes anyway!! She is not asking him to wear more or take any off"]}
