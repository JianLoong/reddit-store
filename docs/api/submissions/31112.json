I\u2019m someone who struggles a lot with understanding emotion/intent through text, and even I can tell that you just though it was a funny faux pas. They happen to all of us, so you giggle and move on\u2026\n\nGetting angry and saying that he\u2019s \u201clost all trust\u201d over this is very over-the-top. Has he ever reacted like this before? Does he have a history of insecurity?", "NTA \nBut in his defense\nAs a former 19m\n\nHe is just insecure about not knowing about that stuff. He probably was nervous even talking about it. Especially if he doesn't have a sister close to his age.  So when ha saw \"haha\" after asking a question, the walls automatically go up and he assumed he was being made fun of. Best thing to do is let him know you weren't laughing at him and if he really want to know more he can ask and you won't laugh. ( as long as you are comfortable with that)", "Nta. Seems more like he's embarrassed that he has no education or knowledge about cycles and such. Just his ego has been hurt. \n\nSounds to me like.hes mentally immature. But it's far from your fault. You tried to have an adult conversation with him and instead of him asking for a bit more information he let his ego get in the way.", "I really don't understand what's wrong with these comments really no one is TA here they are both confused teens no one is to blame here this is something that will be sorted out with age its a normal response on both ends her responsibility is to explain  and his responsibility is to understand clearly he is clueless just as she would b if it was the other way around this is just another one of those teen situations which u will laugh about when you are older and hopefully still together sometimes the internet should not be involved just enjoy your teen problems while you can so you can laugh about them hopefully still with ur current partner when u get older enjoy ur life f the internet and what other ppl think. :)", "NAH - sounds like he is clueless and felt laughed at. Time for SexEd and for better communications that\u2019s probably not over text.", "NTA. He\u2019s just lashing out due to embarrassment. You\u2019re both young, he\u2019ll be fine tomorrow. Maybe don\u2019t rub this post in his face though bc he\u2019s clearly in the wrong.", "Noone TA.\n\nIt sounds like bf was trying to understand and empathize with your concerns. BUT; men have little clue about how women look, periods, and everything that comes along with being a woman. \n\nYou are so young and it sounds like you definitely need to visit a gynecologist for a check up and basic factual information. It is also a good idea to learn as much as you can. The book Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler is a good place to start. We don't know what we don't know. Some people do laugh when they are uncomfortable to fill the silence.", "Lost all trust in you. Talk about an overreaction. \n\nNTA", "NTA. His response was extremely immature and over the line. It was a funny moment that he could have used as a learning experience, since he clearly knows nothing about menstrual cycles, but instead chose to get offended.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is just embarrassed he doesn't know crap about periods. \n\nTell him to get off the pity pony and get over it. Sorry I hurt your feelings babe but damn it was funny!", "NTA - I would call him immature but ya\u2019ll are still teenagers. He\u2019ll learn, just an embarrassing lesson for the dunce.", "NTA. He\u2019s insecure about his lack of knowledge and projected that on you. That being said, depending how many hahas you sent and how condescending you were, he may be justified in not wanting to be open with you in future.", "nta, but i get why he was embarrassed, because the other gender usually actually knows very little about the other", "Bruh 18 year old boys are fucking stupid and your boyfriend is no exception.

If this is all it takes for him to lose all trust in you, then he never had actual trust in you to begin with. \n\nMy advice, if he's not willing to apologize for such an immature outburst, would be the break up and find someone that doesn't have such a fragile ego.", "Wtf?!

Just educate him.", "NTA, he's over-reacting. Being defensive is one thing, but the trust comment is way OTT. \n\nHopefully you can talk in person and explain while it was funny it wasn't meant to be judgemental, it just came across as funny because it was such a weird idea to be sharing pictures like that.

Yeah you WBTA if you don\u2019t apologise but outside of that no one\u2019s at fault here", "NTA,Looks like he doesn't know anything regarding periods and he probably felt you were making fun of him not knowing anything about it.

NTA - he just wasn't paying attention in Sex Ed.", "NTA. But as someone like your boyfriend who has asked questions and gotten laughed at, i just don\u2019t really ask anything anymore.

Unfortunately, most 19 year old men don\u2019t have a very good grasp on menstrual cycles and issues. Hell, most men don\u2019t have a lot of knowledge on the topic for their entire life. \n\nHe\u2019s probably just embarrassed.", "NTA. He's a little baby.", "If this is in (or he grew up in) certain parts of America, it\u2019s very possible he literally has no clue and hasn\u2019t been taught about the female monthly cycle.  Bear in mind, in some parts of the US and world, abstinence is both 100% effective yet still resulted in the birth of the savior of the human race, so when I see this stuff I worry about the general ignorance being pushed in some parts of the world.  In that view asking questions to understand what was going on, regardless of how poorly informed they are, is not a bad thing.  I think a sit down to actually talk about this is required.  This may be a literal case of him showing a genuine concern and getting laughed at for it.", "I don\u2019t see how his reaction was wildly inappropriate. He probably genuinely does not know how the female menses or reproductive cycles work. Those who know would find his answer amusing but to him, you\u2019re laughing at him because he is \u201cdumb\u201d in this subject and the laughing makes him feel stupid.", "Of course you can tell what op meant because you read this post where they are explaining themselves. You didn\u2019t read the texts outside of that context\u2026", "Is it her responsibility to comfort his ego though?", "Adult conversation with the reply of \"hahahaha\"? She found his question funny and amusing,but he found her reply mocking. Simple misunderstanding which could be cleared out by talking to each other than texting.  Both of them are teenagers.

Just doctors haha, since they do analysis and stuff\u201d\n\nDid I sound a bit mean? :(", "Okay well there is no need for THAT is there?", "There's nothing wrong with not knowing, everyone can learn. Saying he's lost all trust in his gf over her explaining something and her thinking his remark was funny, is definitly inappropriate at best. \n\nIf he feels like she's laughing at him for being dumb, he can express that in a normal way and say \"I don't like you laughing at me, it makes me feel dumb\", then OP would have cleared up in 2 minutes she wasn't laughing *at* him, and that he's not dumb and there would be no problem.", "This is exactly why you never take advice from Reddit seriously", "For me, it's a clear NTA, especially since the info you just added. You didn't berate him or were condescending. I actually like when people laugh off my mistakes, correct me and move on. He's probably just embarrassed that he misunderstood and feels it's easier to be \"offended\" than be like \"ah, so that's how that works\" which is really immature of him honestly.\n\nDon't overthink it too much, just talk to him. But you are *definietly* not the AH.", "U don\u2019t sound mean, he took it the wrong way", "I mean maybe just a BIT but definitely not mean enough to warrant that kind of reaction from him."]}
