Sure, tech issues are never fun, but it's even worse if it happens while someone else is using it, because even if it wasn't anything in particular they did, you can't help but feel like it was at least in part their fault. \n\nAlso, make sure to back up any and all customer data you might need on an external drive or in the cloud, as hardware failure isn't an if, it's a when. \n\nPhrase it like this to your bf: let's say you have a work car, except you're the one who paid for it. You mostly just use it to get to and from work & some business meetings, but sometimes on your free time you like to see juuuust how fast that bad boy can go (on private property or a track, somewhere legal).\n\nThen your friend/partner asks if they too could take your work car, that you paid for yourself, and see how fast that bad boy can go. Also, you wouldn't be in the car with them. How comfortable would he feel about letting ANYONE else drive said car on the track (or somewhere else legal), especially with his livelyhood on the line.\n\nSure, most of the time it'd be just fine.

He is not entitled to your expensive  work equipment. It is not even a question of his likelihood of breaking it. You owe him no reasons or explanations. Just No!", "Sharing? Wtf? It's your work computer. Most jobs make you promise not to let anyone touch your work computer for security reasons! You shouldn't let other people on it. Especially not to screw around on it. NTA.

Who wants to game on a laptop anyway they\u2019re dogshit at running games even dedicated gaming laptops", "NTA that's your laptop not his. He's not entitled to use it just because you're dating.

But there\u2019s plenty of other laptops out there that would do the same, yet you bought a gaming laptop for both purposes, and play games on it yourself. To say no to him playing games on a gaming laptop and then you playing them yourself just seems a little bit hypocritical. I feel like you just don\u2019t trust him with it. Which is perfectly fine, as I said, it\u2019s your laptop and you can decide who uses it.", "Nothing hypocritical about it. She worked for it and she paid for it. If SHE fucks it up, SHE will do the extra work that comes as a consequense. If her bf fucks it up, again it's HER that will have to face the consequences. That's the difference."]}
