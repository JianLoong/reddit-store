{"id": 18241, "submission_id": "13siz47", "title": "AITA for kicking out my boyfriend's best friend?", "selftext": "My (23f) boyfriend (27m) recently moved into my apartment for the past 2 months since his place recently got broken into and they ended up stealing and trashing most of the place. It's been great living with him and he's been helping me out alot with chores and everything as thanks for letting him stay while he reorganizes and buys everything. \n\nI really don't mind hosting his friends, especially since I have mine over a bunch too. They're all pretty respectful and clean up after themselves. The only problem is his best friend, who we will call Matt (30). Matt visits the most often and likes to smoke, which is no big deal since he goes onto my balcony. However, I have an FIV+ indoor cat who cannot be outside since I really don't want her getting sick, let alone falling down 2 floors. \n\nMatt has an issue with leaving the sliding doors open and I've had to remind him to close them multiple times due to my cat almost running out. After reminding him for the nth time to close the door, he told me to just throw my cat into the bedroom if I'm so worried. I pretty much snapped and told him he wasn't welcome anymore. He left in a bad mood and when my bf went to ask me, I told him what happened. He said I overreacted, and I could've closed the doors for Matt since he probably just forgot to his ADHD. I'm feeling pretty frustrated right now, but maybe I did overreact, so I wanted to ask reddit since I read on here every once in a while.", "created_utc": 1685121260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13siz47/aita_for_kicking_out_my_boyfriends_best_friend/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Otherwise, you're not only disrespectful, but you'll wear out your welcome.\n\nYou're no longer welcome, Matt.", "He's a guest, he should abide by the house rules.  Definitely NTA.\n\nThat said there's a way to solve this:\nPrint a full page \"close the damn door, Matt\" sign and tape it to the sliding door.  ADHD or not, I assume he can read?\n\nIf Matt has no sense of humor and gets offended, then fuck Matt.", "NTA\n\nYour home, your rules and if the friend can't or won't respect them (it doesn't much matter which) he is not welcome.\n\nYou do not have adjust your animal's routine and environment to cater to a GUEST.", "NTA.   In fact, you've been more tolerant than I would.  \n\nKitty trumps rude guest every single time.  He had no right to tell you to lock the kitty up, as if this is his home!   And if your bf thinks ADHD is an excuse for not following a very basic house rule, I'd be very upset at this, too.", "Not the asshole. \n\nNo matter what condition you have, if a host asks you to close the door, you close the f*cking door! It\u2019s a simple request that the host puts forth, just do it and be polite.", "NTA. Matt is a guest, and, as such, need to be respectful of the rules of your home. Especially since he isn't your guest, but, essentially, a guest of your guest. It isn't your job to adapt your home to him when he comes to visit - it's his job to adapt to it. And Matt's ADHD isn't an excuse for bad behavior - especially since you've asked him to close the doors multiple times.\n\nAlso - \"You are overreacting\" is the typical call of people who *know* they have done wrong but what to turn blame around onto the other person.", "NTA. Leaving the door open not only means exposing your cat to unnecessary danger, but if he's out there smoking, he may as well be doing it inside if the doors are opened. I'm very sensitive to cigarette smoke, so if someone were sucking on a cancer stick on my balcony with the door open, I'd definitely know it and it would make me very unhappy. He's a guest in your home, and it's your house your rules. His suggestion that you put your cat away was flippant, and ADHD is not an excuse.", "The cat lives there. Matt doesn\u2019t. NTA", "Nta Matt can't respect your cats need for safety then he can get out of your cats house.", "NTA\n\nHe wasn't willing to respect your house rules, and then attempted to dictate terms to you in your own house rather than modify his behavior.\n\nAs to your boyfriend, the comment about ADHD is ballsy and stupid. It's one thing to say \"hey, he forgot to close the door a few times, he's got ADHD and there are some predictable issues with that that we should accommodate,\" but this was a safety issue vis-a-vis your cat. If your cat suffered a predictable injury as a consequence of the friends behavior, would he then say \"Sorry your cat died, but ADHD... you know how it is\" ?", "NTA \n\nLeave your cat in a confined space so he doesn\u2019t have to be considerate? Christ on a bike. You did the right thing.", "NTA.  Somebody tells me to lock up my cat in MY apartment because he's too inconsiderate to do one little thing is not welcome.  And NO it's not his ADHD.  He's just an AH.", "NTA. \n\nYou should also remind your boyfriend that it\u2019s your apartment and also your cats, and you are entitled to being stress free in your own home without having to worry about the actions of others.", "NTA, and your bf needs to stay in his lane.", "NTA. Your boyfriend shouldn't be making excuses for him.", "NTA. Your cat lives there. And Matt has some nerve to tell you how to deal with your cat when he's just a visitor. He's an AH. Your BF is as well, at the very least he should stay neutral. It seems fairly obvious he doesn't have a sense of gratitude for you letting him move in to your place.", "NTA - your cat is more important than Matt and his smoking addiction.", "NTA \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your home, your cat, and your rules. As a guest, Matt needs to respect that and shut the sliding door or leave. Your boyfriend should also be reminding him of that as this is not his place either. He\u2019s a temporary occupant", "NTA. Both him and your boyfriend should respect your house. And if his adhd is really that bad how could you trust him to properly put out his butt?", "NTA it's not his house, it's your house and the cats house. If someone was so dismissive about my rules and my concerns in my own home they wouldn't be welcome anymore either.", "NTA\n\n I'm tired of people using adhd as an excuse for being inconsiderate", "NTA nothing bothers me more than when people come to my house and they leave the damn doors open knowing that I have cats and dogs here that can just run out the front door\u2026 you don\u2019t live here my pets do. Close the damn doors.", "NTA. No type of ADHD makes people show blatant disregard to a pet's physical integrity. And tell your boyfriend you're neither his friend's mom nor his doorkeeper.", "NTA. Matt is a guest and can follow your rules, your cat shouldn't have to suffer the consequences of a houseguest's mistake.\n\nIt's probably true that Matt forgot due to his ADHD, but why is his untreated (or improperly treated) illness *your* responsibility to take care of? When you reminded him to close the door, he should have apologized instead of telling you to lock the cat in your bedroom.", "NTA, can't let people take advantage of your kindness and disrespect your home. You're not a door-matt.", "NTA. Your place, your rules, your animal. Your bf should have your back, as he is crashing there (for free I assume). His friends should understand that is your place and not his. Your bf should go to Matt\u2019s house to spend time.", "NTA~ it\u2019s your house, your the one paying rent, you have every power in the world to allow/ not allow certain people in", "NTA and your boyfriend should not excuse his friend\u2019s behaviour due to ADHD.", "NTA it's your apartment he should respect your rules", "NTA. Matt is a guest and technically so is your boyfriend. They both need to be respectful of you and your rules. I applaud you for adopting an FIV+ cat and taking steps to make sure she doesnt get outside! Closing the door is a very minor thing that an adult shouldn't have to be reminded of multiple times. A grown man also should catch an attitude over being told his behavior his no longer going to be welcomed and tolerated. Good for you for standing up for yourself and your apartment/cat.  Your BF is TA if he doesnt back you.", "NTA His behaviour is so disrespectful. He is a guest. And when you really forget something, you don't react like this.\n\nI actually wonder if bfs place was broken into so easy becauseMatt also forgot to close some doors...", "NTA. Also, as an adult who has been diagnosed ADHD my entire life, that excuse is bullshit. If it WAS adhd, he would have apologized, and after the first couple of times, put in actual effort to do better.\n\nThat he's done nothing to change, and does not apologize, he's just a selfish AH.", "Since when does ADHD mean you are excused from taking any responsibility?  NTA.  Your guests guest was being rude.  And your guest (BF) was rude to make excuses for him.  I bet if you let him back he will remember the door now.  Despite his ADHD.", "Bro at this point I will always doubt people who claim they have ADHD. Unless you are diagnosed you cannot use that excuse", "I started to type that I thought kicking him out was a bit much. But, fuck him. That\u2019s disrespectful as hell. It\u2019s your house and your cat has an issue.\n\nMaybe he can should stop smoking so much.", "I started to type that I thought kicking him out was a bit much. But, fuck him.

So he doesn't get to decide who stays at your place.", "This is *your* apartment, not your BF's.  You're '*letting him stay while he reorganizes and buys everything.'* to replace stuff broken/stolen in his old place. It's very nice of you to help out.\n\nHOWERVER....it's been 2 months. AND Matt was **not** part of the deal when BF moved in. BF doesn't seem to be in any hurry to move back into his own place, and it sounds like Matt is trying to move in too.\n\nMatt is 30 yrs. old - why isn't he smoking in his own place? Why is your BF allowing Matt to dictate how *you* need things done in *your* apartment? Why does BF think *'just throw my cat into the bedroom if I'm so worried'* is an acceptable solution to Matt refusing to simply close a sliding door?  \n\nMore importantly, why is your BF accusing *you* of overreacting to Matt's bad behavior *In Your Apartment?*\n\nBF needs to move out and take Matt with him. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
