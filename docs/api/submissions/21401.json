If they choose to work there , that's a choice.", "You don't need to be treated that way by anyone.  NTA.", "NTA. Your choice to move up your exit was selfish, I suppose, but it was a predictable reaction to your manager\u2019s choice to antagonize someone over whom he really had no more power. Generally, breaking a 2-weeks-notice like this is unacceptable moral behavior, but generally the person in your manager\u2019s chair understands the consequences of being rude to someone they have no power over. You attempted to do right by the business, but the manager couldn\u2019t even do the self-serving basic human conduct that requires. What an AH.", "NTA. You are not required to give notice. It\u2019s a professional courtesy that should only extend to jobs where you deem it is appropriate.\n\nThe coworkers who texted you can decide for themselves if they want to stay at a job that screws them at every opportunity.", "Nope!", "NTA I think it would serve him right if they quit to.", "NTA - I'm a big fan of not burning bridges you may want to walk over in the future.

I think maybe the family needs to look at their kids (mgr) behaviors and do something before they loose the others.", "Why are they texting you when you don't work there anymore? Weird.

Good for you!\n\nIf I can help you in your job search, let me know. Hopefully you already had something lined up and are just waiting to start.", "NTA. 2 weeks notice is a courtesy not a legal requirement. You have to prioritize your mental health and well being.
