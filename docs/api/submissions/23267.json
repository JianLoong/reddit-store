We met through a mutual friend and he learned very quickly that I am a vegan. About a year after we met and got closer, we started dating. He had no issues with me being vegan, but made it very clear that I couldn\u2019t force him into being a vegan, which I respected. I haven\u2019t ever put him down for eating meat in front of me, as that is his choice. Each to their own. We even served both vegan and meat-inclusive food at our wedding to accommodate both of our families. \n\nUp till now, everything was great. However, recently I\u2019ve been seeing a ton of vegan recipes on my pinterest and decided I wanted to try making one for dinner. We don\u2019t usually end up getting to have fancy dinners at home as both of us work full time, but I found some time today to cook something up. It was a recipe for pulled pork sandwiches, but the pork wasn\u2019t actually pork, instead it was jackfruit. He seemed a little stressed about work but I showed him the surprise dinner, and that seemed to help his mood out.\n\nHe ate it happily, and even complimented my cooking. But when he asked what was in it - and when I told him it was a pulled pork sandwich with jackfruit as a meat alternative - he lashed out. He shouted, telling me that he made it clear he was staying a meat eater. I tried explaining that I wasn\u2019t trying to turn him into a vegan, but he\u2019d just walked away then. This happened a few hours back, and now he\u2019s refusing to talk to me.\n\nI feel like I might be the asshole for making him a vegan meal even though he\u2019d made it extremely clear he wouldn\u2019t become one, because even if it wasn\u2019t my intention to make him one I still made a vegan dinner that passed off as one with meat in it.\n\nSo Reddit, Am I the Asshole?\n\n\nEDIT: This is a pretty commonly asked question so I\u2019ll just clear it up here, I didn\u2019t say it was a pulled pork sandwich. All I had said was that I made some sandwiches for us, nothing more and nothing less.", "created_utc": 1690480512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15b8ljg/aita_for_making_my_husband_a_vegan_dinner_even/", "score": 9960, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He enjoyed the food when he didn't know what was in it, but suddenly changed his mind when he found out it wasn't meat? If he's that worried about 'not becoming a vegan', he should have questioned the recipe *before* eating. Or better yet, make his own meal or help with the meal prep (so he can actually see how it's being made).

That's where I'm confused. Does he expect you to make two different meals for him? Does he try to force his meat eating on you by making food only he can eat, or does he make two options? Idk why he is mad. If you are eating it, obviously it is vegan, meaning it does not have meat \ud83d\ude05 my husband is a carnivore but will gladly eat vegan food I make for myself.

Just because you eat ONE vegan meal doesn\u2019t suddenly mean you\u2019ve transformed into a vegan. I\u2019m Muslim, and MOST times I go out to eat with family or get takeaway, I have to order vegetarian and even vegan or pescatarian stuff because there\u2019s nothing halal.

He enjoyed the meal, and is being very dramatic.", "NTA\n\nEating one (1) vegan-friendly meal doesn't suddenly make him a vegan. You haven't cost him his Gold Star Omnivore Card.", "No, this is ridiculous. He was perfectly fine and happy with the meal until he was told it wasn't meat and then suddenly got mad.

My husband and I eat meat but we also regularly eat vegetarian and sometimes plant based meals as well. Your a vegan. Of course your going to cook vegan dishes.

I eat red meat and I just made jackfruit BBQ tacos the other day because... it's tasty, and healthier.\n\nPeople who can't handle an occasional vegetarian/vegan meals are whiney little snowflakes.

If I'm cooking and they wanted some, fine, if not, eat something else.  I had no problem with them eating meat and vice versa and often times they enjoyed the meat alternative stuff I cooked because of the taste.  Your husband needs to chill the f\\*ck out and apologize.  Did he think he was eating meat made by a vegan?  I mean, I've made meat for others even when vegetarian but no one would expect that, ridiculous.", "NTA he should talk to a therapist about why vegetables offend him so much.", "NTA and did he not wonder why YOU were not only making but eating pulled pork? Like what sort of delusion is he holding on to thinking that a VEGAN just suddenly makes and eats pork?!\n\nI used to be a vegetarian but I'm an omnivore now.

You are not pushing veganism on him - you made a meal that you could eat and that he ended up enjoying.  I do not see the issue.  \n\nI can't eat dairy so I use plant-based milks, butters, cheeses, etc. in meals. My husband doesn't care as long as it tastes good.

Therefore, it was almost certainly vegan.  \n\nYou would only be the asshole if you lied and said it was meat.

Here's the kicker. If he saw you eating it, he should have been smart enough to figure out it wasn't meat.\n\nYou made him dinner and he's upset that you didn't give him a warning that it didn't have meat in it?

If he is seriously that much of a caveman that he HAS to have meat with every meal, he can take care of himself.\n\nSmall tip for the future if he's able to get his act together and not be an asshole: when I make vegetarian meals, I always make a side of chicken or brown up some ground beef to add for my husband.

Why is that your responsibility? \n\nYou weren't preventing him from eating meat, and he clearly eats things that are not meat, including vegetables, so it's not like he ate anything he wouldn't normally. I'm so confused as to why he is upset, but if you both work full time and you prepared a dinner he enjoyed, the only words out of his mouth should have been \"thank you.\" In the future, I would just let him know that tonight's dinner you're making doesn't have meat, and if he wants meat he'll have to make it himself.

What difference does it make if it was vegan or not? The only reasonable explanation would be if there's some kind of past trauma involving a parent forcing him to eat food he didn't want/like at the risk of extreme punishment, but even then his reaction in this situation is WAY, WAY out of line. HE LIKED WHAT YOU COOKED. I love meat but I'm also not against eating vegan meals - if it's delicious and filling, who cares? Also, how did it slip by him that you, a vegan, were also eating the same food?\n\nI get having a bad day at work, but throwing a tantrum over food is what three year olds do.", "NTA.

What kind of child gets mad at the person who made them food?", "NTA. Who tf is going to expect a vegan to cook with meat? Obviously anything you make will be vegan and if he wants to enjoy the spoils of YOUR LABOR then he needs to suck it up. Likewise I would expect you would not expect him to cook without meat.

They can't expect me to be a vegan, but I can't expect them to make non vegan food is my assumption going in.  If they offered me something I would ASSUME it's vegan from the get go.
