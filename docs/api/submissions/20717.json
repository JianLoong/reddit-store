She\u2019s not good about eating leftovers (the small of a lot of cold food makes her feel sick), so she tries to meal prep or cook just enough to cover 2 meals max as she knows letting food spoil irks me.\nWhen we have leftovers, I always let her know when her portion is still in the fridge. Typically she tells me to have it if I want it. She has said before that if she were truly coming back for it, she\u2019d write her name on it or tell me not to eat it as she was saving it for later, but to my recollection she has never done that. I always tell her that the leftovers are her\u2019s so she can have them, and we go back and forth like that in several rounds.\nThe other night, we had leftover Chinese takeout (her leftovers, I ate mine).

It sounds to me like she HAS considered your preferences by making smaller portions and communicating with you. Considering leftovers make her feel sick, I\u2019m not sure what else you expect her to do.", "YTA. You need to seek therapy. I also grew up in a really poverty struck family, we were homeless multiple times, on state assistance, went to food banks - you name it, we did it. I also cannot stand leftovers because of it. Unless I purposely buy something I know I'm going to eat as leftovers or that I'm meal prepping - I cannot do it. I'm steady, but I'm not well off, so I'm super careful but admit I do toss more food than I care to admit.\n\nThe reason I vote this way is because if you remind her 3 times and she tells you each time to eat it and you then continue to just remind her, it feels more like you're shaming her and instead of eating them the first, second... or THIRD time she told you to, then yeah... I don't blame her for tossing it. She's also your wife, not your child, she doesn't need your permission to do something...", "YTA\n\nI don't understand why you think your upbringing means she has to eat leftovers she doesn't want. Why is your upbringing the most important? Maybe because of her upbringing you should stop assigning her leftovers.\n\nThere isn't even a lack of communication here, there has been you ignoring her when she outright told you multiple times you should eat her share of the leftovers.", "YTA. I was prepared to say not the A because your wife is throwing out food before it expires - when she knows your upbringing and how important minimizing food waste is to you. \n\nHowever, you know she isn\u2019t fond of takeout leftovers and won\u2019t eat them, and she\u2019s repeatedly told you that you can have them if you want them. She is the main cook in the household per your post and you keep reminding her she has leftovers in the fridge while she\u2019s making food for the both of you.", "YTA. Your wife has made her position on leftovers very clear and you don't seem to be able to adapt to that. Let me recap. First, she basically gave you a free pass to eat her leftovers whenever you want because she by default doesn't want them. You weren't comfortable with that setup (though it doesn't sound like there was ever a situation where you ate her leftovers and she got mad about it), so you keep reminding her about the leftovers that she has basically said she never wants. She got sick of this and threw out some food. I understand that that's wasteful and upsetting to you, but you were driving her crazy and she snapped. She's also now given you clear expectations for the new system so that you both don't have to keep getting upset over this all the time.\n\nAlso, just to cement you being TA, you say \"if I had known she\u2019d toss them instead of conceding in eating them after understanding I truly didn\u2019t mind her eating them herself.\" Dude, this has so clearly never been about her thinking she's not allowed to eat her own leftovers. The issue is YOU not being able to understand that she DOESN'T want to eat her leftovers and is quite happy to let you have them.

How many times is she supposed to offer, exactly?", "You're complaining she doesn't take your feelings into consideration but you're actually doing exactly that; you even mentioned cold leftovers can make her sick but you try to stick to how you did leftovers when you were growing up. She even changed cooking habits in respect to your food concerns\n\nYou need to just listen to your wife and accept that when she says you can have something that she means it; absolutely unreasonable for you to expect her to go above and beyond that just because you don't trust what she's saying to be true.

Stop hassling your wife or you\u2019ll end up thawing sad one-portion meals in the microwave every day.", "YTA. These are her leftovers. She has agency over her stuff and frankly the whole thing makes you sound like a tedious bore.  I relate to being poor and what not growing up,  but newsflash, you are forcing her to live with your poverty mindset.  Sounds like she is working and contributing to the household and you're not supporting her.  She should not have to listen to a man who does not fully support her about left overs.  It does not make sense.  It's her food.  You're petty.", "YTA\n\nJust eat her leftovers. I don't even understand the problem here.", "YTA. This is a very petty thing to fight about. Just suck it up and move on.", "YTA, it was her food. She has every right to throw it out, whether she asks you or not.", "YTA\n\nYou know it also really bothers me when people don\u2019t eat leftovers, there are only a few foods (like fast food) that don\u2019t reheat perfectly well and are just fine for a second meal. The thing is *you can\u2019t force people to eat*. Yes even leftovers. If you don\u2019t want them to go to waste eat them yourself. It\u2019s unacceptable for you to try and force her to eat them. She\u2019s already made the very reasonable concession of altering portion sizes so she\u2019s less likely to make leftovers. She gave you as many signals as humanly possible that the leftovers were yours. She told you they made her feel sick, she told you everything without her name on it was fair game. But you just can\u2019t take the hint. So here it is: your wife will not eat leftovers and it\u2019s shitty to try and force her to or punish her for not doing so. Eat them yourself.

It's not saving money by letting it go bad in the fridge.", "YTA Your wife has done a very sensible thing in setting a boundary about the leftovers. This is to avoid any further confrontation on the issue. She'll tolerate you asking her three times and then she'll throw it out. I did something similar with my husband. \"I am not cooking dinner until the dishes from the previous night have been washed. I'm not going to remind you, I just won't cook dinner\". He would rave and rant about how petty I was but I just didn't want to argue about it any more so I changed how I dealt with it. And then I divorced him.", "My family put nutmeg on every vegetable. Historically, thought by grandma. I think it\u2019s disgusting. No way I\u2019m going to repeat that. \n\nSo YTA. And a controlling one. I get tired only of reading how you handle leftovers. You probably don\u2019t have kids? Just put those leftovers in the fridge and if you are really keen on them, put your name on it.

You\u2019ll inevitably force them to eat things they don\u2019t want to.", "YTA. This kind of relationship with food is your psychological issue that you have to address in therapy, not reload it on your wife. She has remarkable patience, I would definitely blow up on the second \"asking four times\" leftover occasion. She doesn't eat leftovers, period. It isn't ok to constantly try to make her eat them.

Yes, your wife should tell you about rules if she\u2019s then going to cite them when doing stuff, agreed on that.

Idk where their money for eating out came from, because they didn\u2019t work. NTA- purposeful food waste really drives me crazy. Also can someone explain the \u201ccold leftovers\u201d thing?
