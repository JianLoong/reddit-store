It sounds to me like she HAS considered your preferences by making smaller portions and communicating with you. Considering leftovers make her feel sick, I\u2019m not sure what else you expect her to do.", "YTA. You need to seek therapy. I also grew up in a really poverty struck family, we were homeless multiple times, on state assistance, went to food banks - you name it, we did it. I also cannot stand leftovers because of it. Unless I purposely buy something I know I'm going to eat as leftovers or that I'm meal prepping - I cannot do it. I'm steady, but I'm not well off, so I'm super careful but admit I do toss more food than I care to admit.\n\nThe reason I vote this way is because if you remind her 3 times and she tells you each time to eat it and you then continue to just remind her, it feels more like you're shaming her and instead of eating them the first, second... or THIRD time she told you to, then yeah... I don't blame her for tossing it. She's also your wife, not your child, she doesn't need your permission to do something...", "YTA\n\nI don't understand why you think your upbringing means she has to eat leftovers she doesn't want.

Your wife has made her position on leftovers very clear and you don't seem to be able to adapt to that. Let me recap. First, she basically gave you a free pass to eat her leftovers whenever you want because she by default doesn't want them. You weren't comfortable with that setup (though it doesn't sound like there was ever a situation where you ate her leftovers and she got mad about it), so you keep reminding her about the leftovers that she has basically said she never wants. She got sick of this and threw out some food. I understand that that's wasteful and upsetting to you, but you were driving her crazy and she snapped. She's also now given you clear expectations for the new system so that you both don't have to keep getting upset over this all the time.\n\nAlso, just to cement you being TA, you say \"if I had known she\u2019d toss them instead of conceding in eating them after understanding I truly didn\u2019t mind her eating them herself.\" Dude, this has so clearly never been about her thinking she's not allowed to eat her own leftovers.

How many times is she supposed to offer, exactly?", "You're complaining she doesn't take your feelings into consideration but you're actually doing exactly that; you even mentioned cold leftovers can make her sick but you try to stick to how you did leftovers when you were growing up.

Stop hassling your wife or you\u2019ll end up thawing sad one-portion meals in the microwave every day.", "YTA. These are her leftovers. She has agency over her stuff and frankly the whole thing makes you sound like a tedious bore.  I relate to being poor and what not growing up,  but newsflash, you are forcing her to live with your poverty mindset.  Sounds like she is working and contributing to the household and you're not supporting her.  She should not have to listen to a man who does not fully support her about left overs.  It does not make sense.  It's her food.  You're petty.", "YTA\n\nJust eat her leftovers. I don't even understand the problem here.", "YTA. This is a very petty thing to fight about. Just suck it up and move on.", "YTA, it was her food. She has every right to throw it out, whether she asks you or not.", "YTA\n\nYou know it also really bothers me when people don\u2019t eat leftovers, there are only a few foods (like fast food) that don\u2019t reheat perfectly well and are just fine for a second meal. The thing is *you can\u2019t force people to eat*. Yes even leftovers. If you don\u2019t want them to go to waste eat them yourself. It\u2019s unacceptable for you to try and force her to eat them. She\u2019s already made the very reasonable concession of altering portion sizes so she\u2019s less likely to make leftovers. She gave you as many signals as humanly possible that the leftovers were yours. She told you they made her feel sick, she told you everything without her name on it was fair game. But you just can\u2019t take the hint. So here it is: your wife will not eat leftovers and it\u2019s shitty to try and force her to or punish her for not doing so. Eat them yourself.

I did something similar with my husband. \"I am not cooking dinner until the dishes from the previous night have been washed. I'm not going to remind you, I just won't cook dinner\".

If you\u2019re trying to be humanitarian for the earth, food waste doesn\u2019t fucking matter. Plastic in the goddamn oceans matters.\n\nOp is up his ass about controlling a grown woman\u2019s eating habits, and from the sound of it OP doesn\u2019t like leftovers either, so feels like eating them I\u2019d suffering through it to \u201cearn\u201d fresh cooked food. That\u2019s a really unhealthy relationship to have with food and can lead to a lot of stress and gaining of weight. \n\nThe argument of \u201cbut there are starving people in the world\u201d doesn\u2019t mean shit. Eating your food doesn\u2019t solve world fucking hunger, if you want to help with that you should donate to food banks, help in soup kitchens, volunteer to pack food that gets shipped to third world countries, etc etc.\n\nEspecially OP if he is wanting to feel \u201cnot wasteful\u201d he should start doing monthly affordable donations to food banks to help families in need like the one he grew up in. That\u2019s a healthy response. Not whatever this shit is.", "YTA. Where is the compromise? We all know that people are brought up differently, doesn\u2019t make either side wrong.

Why make it a battle and be so stubborn about it? \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t like eating majority of takeouts the next day, never have.

That is where the communication and compromise comes in. He also admitted that she made changes to compromise and it just wasn\u2019t good enough for him.", "I grew up poor as fuck and as a result I try not to be wasteful. My partner on the other hand was an only child and she admits that she was a bit spoiled and a bit of a brat when it came to food. Now we live together. Generally I do the cooking because I enjoy it. She loves that she doesn\u2019t have to cook. Win/win for both of us.\n\nReading OP\u2019s story, I got the impression that my partner and his partner are fairly similar in nature when it comes to left overs. Some she\u2019ll eat, some she won\u2019t. When I see the food sitting in the fridge, I\u2019ll remind her once that we have leftovers available, usually in the morning before I head out for work things. By the time I get home, they\u2019ve either been eaten, or not. If they\u2019re still there and I want them, I\u2019ll say I\u2019m gonna eat them, and then do that. If by some chance she realizes she wants them, then I\u2019ll make something else.\n\nNow I do have a little part of my brain that feels letting good spoil is wasteful and wants to avoid it. But no amount of begging is going to change how my partner feels about it, and it\u2019s my own issue, not hers. She knows how I feel, and we try to compromise by not making/buying too much food. But sometimes things can\u2019t be helped. It is what it is.\n\nIt\u2019s weird. We just talk to each other, respect what the other person has to say, and when one of us says something, the other believes them. We don\u2019t attempt to change each other because we have control issues. As a result we don\u2019t get in arguments about food. Funny how communication and respect works, eh?", "Ding ding ding we have a winner", "Agreed, though I doubt the leftovers are the only issue he has \ud83d\ude10", "Yeah, he wants a compromise, but only when it's done his way.", "Yeah this is bananas, I feel sorry for the wife that has put up with constant leftover reminders for 10 years.", "It seems like the \"fairness\" is an angle people are omitting. An upbringing like that, you might get punished for eating too many of the leftovers because it means someone else goes hungry.

Which is why he nags her and is miffed when she says he can have them. In his head it's like he's done his half of the washing up and said to her \"your half is there to do, remember\" and she's gone \"no thanks, do it if you want\". And after reminding her three times she's swept all the washing up into the bin and gone \"problem solved\".\n\nIt's obviously an incredibly messed up relationship with food/leftovers, but from his writing that is exactly what he is thinking.\n\nHe has a complex around inevitable levels of food waste, presumably learned from his family, that he is making her problem.
