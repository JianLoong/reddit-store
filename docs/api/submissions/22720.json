Being closeted does not give people an excuse to behave in an amoral fashion that hurts others and uses them unknowingly as a beard.\n\nIf Sammy didn't want to be in a position where it was ok to out her she shouldn't have thrown you under the bus and made her secret the collateral for failure in this situation.

Even if they will never take care of you in turn!", "This is a ridiculous take.  You help your family - you don't let your monumentally selfish sister get you kicked out of your house to keep her secret.\n\nTo OP?\n\nNTA - you had every right to bring out the truth to protect yourself.  Especially when your sister is about to let this secret cause you to lose your home.  There are dozens of ways sister could have owned up to what she did w/o outing herself...it's not \\*your\\* responsibility to find one of those ways when she's actively trying to put blame on you for something that gets you kicked out.", "The same critique sometimes gets the same response.", "You look out for her.", "You have to take up for your sister even if it's hard or she's wrong.", "Yep! Do it till it kills you! Because you just don\u2019t matter! She matters more!", "Nah - you sure don't.  The moment said sister tries to do something to intentionally f up your life they lose the right to having their secrets kept.  You know how OP's sister could have kept her secret?  Follow the house rules and don't sneak her GF in.  Her sexuality / gender / status as his sibling have nothing at all to do with whether she needs to follow the SO rules in the house - nor does her sexuality entitle her to ruin OP's life .\n\nOP's sister set herself up for the fall and OP had no obligation to give up his home to protect her from her own stupidity.", "Your sarcasm is delightful, but you look out for the people you care for, even if they're in the wrong.", "Yeah! Because you don\u2019t matter as much as them right? They deserve it more?"]}
