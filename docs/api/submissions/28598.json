Seats are narrow,  aisles have become more narrow to accommodate adding in an extra seat or two to the rows,  the seats are closer together.\n\nI just had this conversation with some flight attendants a couple months ago about it. They were talking about the gradual changes,  and how it's so much harder for them to do their jobs,  and for the people flying.

The measurements for many planes suit people 5'5 and under - yes,  I  measured,  because I am curious and like to find things out.  \n\nThe seats recline,  but are most commonly reclined during night flights,  where everyone is reclined at the same time and have a tiny bit of space to move back and save their knees.  \n\nThe last flight I did was 13 hours.

It is commonly accepted widely that reclining in crowded quarters is poor plane etiquette.  \n\nImpeding on those practices out of necessity has always been accepted - people with health issues or sudden problems that need a little extra accommodation briefly is something everyone takes on a bit,  to help out.

If they want to use it, so be it. I am glad for the extra space when it happens. I don't get mad when it doesn't.", "Really? No way that\u2019s crazy lol", "Plot twist, can we hear your side?", "A reclined seat does not use up any space allocated to the passenger behind it.  It uses only the amount of space it is designed to take and is allocated to its recline.", "But what if not reclining is inconvenient for you and adds to your discomfort? Isn't that important? I think it should be.\n\nThe seats are made to recline so people should be allowed to do so. And I say that as someone who doesn't recline. But if other people want to, I don't feel I have reason to tell them not to, just because I'm left uncomfortable. That's not their problem.\n\nYou get what you pay for. If you sit in coach, you get a cramped seat. Pay more to request a seat in a bulkhead row. Or pay to be in another section. If you don't have the money to do that, you have to put up with what you can afford.", "Plane-dependent, some of them go back pretty far, but the bigger problem is that planes are packed with bare minimum leg room such that they're already cramped before reclining, and one inch back can mean knee pain the entire flight.", "How much they can recline depends on the model of plane/what seats are installed, but the difference is significant. For me it's enough that a tolerable flight can become completely intolerable if the person in front of me reclines. Personally I NEVER recline for this reason unless the seat behind me is empty, a little bit of comfort for me is not worth making someone else uncomfortable.", "not super far back, but enough that you can usually tell. i'm 5' with short legs and i've had people recline so that i could barely reach my backpack under the seat. i can only imagine what tall people feel like.", "Yep, and I told the pilot while boarding that I needed him to do an extra soft landing cuz, you know, I'm pregnant. And then I told the flight attendant that she shouldn't serve any of those stinky tapas snacks cuz, you know, I'm pregnant. And, then I told the guys next to me that I might need getting up a lot to use the restroom on this 60 minute flight to Portland but I might not,  cuz, you know, I'm pregnant. And then I told the lady with the heavy bag trying to get it into the overhead compartment that I couldn't help her with that cuz, you know, I'm pregnant.\n\nWhat the heck are you talking about? Neither I nor the tall gentleman mentioned in OP's post should have to accommodate someone else's lack of courtesy. Is this your way of gaslighting someone? \"Hey, how was he supposed to know you were pregnant before he jacked that seat into your unborn baby?\" \n\nJust because you can do something doesn't absolve you from responsibility for the intended harm caused by doing it. There's a whole lot of attorneys who make a whole lot of money from people with your line of thinking.", "People are going to be assholes. I've been flying internationally for 30+ years and about 80% of people recline their seats because they will prioritize their comfort than yours.. selfish? Yes, it is. But expected on a plane. It comes down to \"why is your comfort more important than mine?\" \n\nPeople gonna recline..\n\nSometimes you have to put up with discomfort.", "If I'm tall and know for a fact that about 80% of people recline their seats all the time.. yes I would shell out $100 for better seats.\n\nFor my comfort. It's not fair but thts how it is.", "\"Failure to plan on your part doesn't constitute an emergency on mine.\"\n\nOP did nothing wrong. No one has to accommodate you.", "A request made to put the seat back up, request was denied. Keep it pushing \"dweeb\"", "There is a difference between reclining, and choosing to recline when you know you are ***actively*** inflicting pain on someone who does not have a choice to avoid it at this point. Your view is that inflicting that pain is acceptable because you paid for the ticket. \n\nMy view is that is pretty selfish and borderline cruel. Context matters.", "If he reclined it into the other guy's knees, he doesn't then get to complain when the guy's knees repeatedly hit his seat, because there's literally nowhere else for them to go.", "And boy are my arms tired. \ud83e\udd23", "Yea so turns out the dude who posted this wasn\u2019t talking about me which is absolutely insane because I just had almost this exact thing happen, but I messaged him and confirmed that he indeed was not the guy", "That isn\u2019t even responsive to your own question. There\u2019s a significant cost for that extra room. Also, you may have noticed that not every airplane is equipped with unlimited exit row/bulkhead seating. Can you imagine the possibility that a tall person might not have the option to book those seats because they\u2019ve already been booked?", "He didn't state it was an emergency. It's called common decency.", "And the denial of this request has repercussions. Idk how I can possibly break this down into easily understood pieces any more for you \ud83d\ude02", "Inflicting pain... don't be dramatic. We are talking about discomfort here. \n\nIf someone is in active pain from flying, they should probably find another mean of transportation.", "Then buy premium economy. \n\nI didn't weigh in because yes, recling makes you an asshole but I will be an asshole so I'm more comfortable.", "I'm guessing that comprehension and grammar wasn't your strong suite in school.", "Such as? I have sciatic nerve impingement, and extremely long legs. I live 3000 miles from my family. I'm in pain for the entire flight and 24 hours after each leg of the trip, every time. But there's no other option, other than never seeing my family (and never traveling for work, not seeing my mother before she died, etc.) again.", "Ok?", "*suit. \nIf you're that into grammar, the phrase is \"strong suit\". \ud83d\udc4d", "Pot, meet kettle.\n\n(It's suit, not suite. Maybe work on your own English before criticizing someone else's.)", "You can reserve a plane seat with more leg room. You could make the trip by bus/train on multiple days. \n\nYou shouldn't rely on other people giving up their own comfort so you can get some.", "Multiple days of sitting is much, much worse for my back. And unfortunately, I can't afford first class. I always book an aisle if one is available. But literally, the person in front of me can't recline their seat, because once I'm seated, the seat won't recline. It'll just press against my knees and not go anywhere. If the person in front of me needs the extra space, hopefully they can afford the bigger seat, because once I'm seated, their seat won't move."]}
