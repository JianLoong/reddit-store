I was always planning to send Hannah to a private that is near us. It's a really good school and only a 5 minutes walk from our home. It's expensive but it's worth it as it's a college prep school.\n\nMy wife said she wants Coby to go to the same school. Here is the problem. Coby is below avergae. He has never had any grade better than a D eventhough my wife and I help him with his studies a lot and even got him some tutors.\n\nI think it will be a waste of money to send him to such an expensive school. I've already spent so much money on his tutors. I can only send one child there and I think I should send Hannah since it will actually be good for her.\n\nI said this to my wife and told her I think we should send Coby to a public school. It's not very close to our home so he will have to take the bus.\n\nMy wife thinks I'm an asshole for spending more money on my daughter's education.

In the US, competent teachers are fleeing the profession due to mistreatment and a lack of compensation. \n\nPublic schools (US) are also decreasing art and tech classes due to a lack of funding.

You need to do what is best for BOTH your children, and currently neither of you has Coby's best interests at heart. You are fighting over money and perceived fairness, not over what is going to be the most beneficial for Coby's future.\n\nHannah is academically minded.  That's great, and if you can afford to send her to a school that will prep her to get into a great college then great.  Going to that school is in her best interests.\n\nCoby is not academically minded.  If he can't get over a D grade, even with extra tuition, he is either the laziest boy alive, or it's time to realise that traditional academic education might not be the right path for him.  Would going to this school likely actually help him improve his grades? Is he even interested in going to this school?

Is he a hard working kid that is just a little behind or is he lazy and not taking school seriously?", "Although you have a point it's unfair and yes a--hole-y for you to shut it down without talking to her and coming to some sort of compromise. Yes, your own kid is above average now but you don't have a crystal ball on how she'll be able to thrive in a different environment than she's used to. Your spouse is an a--hole for not seeing the ramifications without a solution that would benefit her kid. And did you ask either kid what's their take to going to a private school? \n\nEveryone sucks here.\n\nI do get where you're coming from. Private school's curriculum is higher than public school. Putting your kids in there when they're used to a different environment without preparation might be setting them up to fail. Even for your own kid. I have seen quite a few kids fail hard because they're not used to the curriculum. I have seen A+ students from public school going into private have such a hard time with the change. Instead of flat out saying no you might need to compromise. Bring your kids to the open house or private tour. Take note that majority of what constitutes as an A+ in public school is a B in private schools so you would need to ask how is their curriculum. From there alone you may be able to tell if your kids will be in that range or not. Another thing to be mindful is the amount of work they expect their students. It's a lot. Also check if they ask kids to withdraw from the school based on their failing grades etc. Some private schools offer summer classes to incoming freshmen for them to get a feel of the place. If your wife still wants the kid to go then suggest that she pay for private tutors to help your stepkid. If it's years away for both kids to go to HS then it's best to put them in a private MS now so they're used to the pace. Or you can put both your kids to an academic summer camp to help them get ahead now. Please know not everyone is a high achiever in private school how they're able to handle it depends on the resiliency of the child. They won't be able to achieve that resiliency unless you as a parent help them.", "I\u2019d guess a private school would probably help your stepson as he\u2019d get good tuition on a continuing basis. \n\nTbh yeah I think you\u2019re a bit of an arse  for differentiating between the 2 kids and writing your stepson off. You\u2019re not treating them equally at all. \n\nBut then if your wife is so concerned then she should maybe get a job and help pay for him herself.

I think the issue is bigger than this one decision.", "ESH\n\nMaybe both parents could have a couple of conversations with Coby about what he sees his future like. Where does he want to go to high school? What educational/career plans does he have for after high school?\n\nAnd then make choices based on how Coby can best achieve his goals.", "NTA - though it should be clear that the issue is his performance (or lack thereof), not that you will not spend the money if he does earn a spot.  \n\nYou don't mention ages - is there time for him to step up before it's time to choose a high school?  Is he even interested in attending this school?And if both are true, does it seem like he would be attending college?

My step child is bright enough, but not on the same level, and he did not manage to get a scholarship despite a good effort - though he did test well enough to earn his own spot.

If he doesn't then he doesn't get to go. No favouritism required.", "He has been evaluated for everything you can think of.", "See? Exactly\n\nHe needed extra assistance. Now she needs the better school. So not unfair right?", "Please don\u2019t have another child, since you\u2019re not being kind or fair to your stepson already with one biological child.\n\nI feel for how you\u2019ll treat him if you have two. \n\nHe wants to go to the private school; give him the chance.", "If you and your wife do not believe in him then he is at a disadvantage in life. Why does he never get better than a D? Is it a learning disability?  Behavioral issues? You can keep throwing money at the tutors but that may not be the best way to address his grades. He needs parents that have not given up hope that he can do better and are committed to trying various ways to help him.", "I was anticipating a plethora of responses from you, but I genuinely wasn't expecting you to openly admit you prefer your wallet to your stepson.", "Wow. You are dead-set on seeing this boy struggle and fail to save yourself money, aren\u2019t you? You have a once in a lifetime opportunity where he is *actually interested in a school*, and this could be the thing that lets him turn his achievement around - and you\u2019re not even entertaining it.\n\nSpend the money on him. Stop being an AH.", "Look, you\u2019re right in that it\u2019s your money. However, it\u2019s your wife\u2019s son/your step son. Treating him so differently will not endear you to her. What if she decides that your blatant favouritism of your own daughter (yes it\u2019s fine to live your daughter more and have a special relationship but this is pretty blatant) and straight up saying that her son\u2019s not worth the money leads her to seek a divorce from you? \n\nYou earn the money, so you have final say, but don\u2019t be surprised if she leaves over this. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a good chance that if you get your way this leads to a ton of resentment in your home, from coby to hannah, wife to you, perhaps even wife to Hannah. Treating them so obviously differently is a guaranteed recipe for the kids to clash constantly. \n\nCan confirm from personal experience, cohabitating step siblings who despise each other don\u2019t make for a peaceful, harmonious home. I have seen that alone break marriages between \u2018soulmates\u2019.", "ADHD?", "I suspect the 'better school' might actually help your son to improve in his studies.\nBut that aside, I actually don't think your TA for considering different options for the two kids. The real problem is your unwillingness to consider others' opinions and preferences - specifically your wife and son in this situation.", "If you're only sending your SS to the free school to save money, then yes, YTA. \n\nKids mature at different rates and need different things at different times. I know someone who is a literal rocket scientist, but barely made it through elementary school. Boys are often behind girls in elementary school achievement. \n\nOn the other hand, depending on the private school culture, it may be a great fit for your daughter, or not. For your SS, or not. Some private schools are amazing - some of the lowest quality private schools are terrible.  Who knows what's best for him? But that's not your concern, apparently. \n\nThe problem is that you aren't acting in the best interest of both of the children in your home. Your intent is to punish and save money based on your judgments of a very small boy - who has had disruptions in his early life. Love him up, if you can. Work with your wife to find the educational setting, public or private - that is best for him.", "YWBTA - look I\u2019m am a huge fan of the adage \u201cfair =/= equal.  In parenting, sometimes that means that one child gets more of something (money or time) than another when it\u2019s necessary BUT ONLY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  And NEVER AT THE LONG TERM EFFECT OF THE OTHET CHILDREN.  Or the overall household.\n\nSo in this case OP you would be doing a huge disservice toward your SS and your overall family long term.  I can list a number of ways this will backfire on you that aren\u2019t even about the overarching unequal treatment.*\n\nSo why not COMPROMISE?  Tell your wife and your son that you will enroll him in the private school as long as he maintains a C+ average the first year and B+ average every year after.  This motivates him to get good grades and motivates his mom to help him succeed.  \n\nAlong the way, you can also help him figure out where his strengths are and what he might want to do for his future.  Because I also believe that not all kids NEED to go to university.  But in middle school, they may not know WHAT they really want to do.  \n\nYou know he a parent.  Because what if this was your daughter?  Would you really have happily put her on abus for two hours?", "Did you manage to think of it? Yes? Then yes he has been evaluated\n\nYou and my wife just need to accept that he is bellow average. Someone has to be bellow average that's why it's called average", "Well aren't you just lovely. But I'm sure the stress of dealing with you has nothing to do with the stepson's grades /s.", "Come on lol. OP said he\u2019s been evaluated for everything and that commenter replied with literally the most obvious condition. OP\u2019s snarky reply was completely deserved."]}
