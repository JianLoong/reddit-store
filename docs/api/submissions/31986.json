I recently just had a baby. And We decided not to tell anyone the name till the baby was born.\n\nMy stepsister was also pregnant. We both had very similar names in mind. I liked Mary-Kay. My stepsister liked the names Mary-Grace. My stepsister did choose the name first, but our names weren\u2019t identical. And she still insisted I didn\u2019t use Mary-Kay\n still.\n\nWe did anyways and when I announced My stepsister called us and had a cow. She said we disrespected her knowing she picked the name first and now she has to choose a new baby such short notice. We reminded her that the names aren\u2019t identical and there is no reason to change, but she just got upset and hung up.\n\nstepmom soon called us later backing up my sister saying how childish we acted keeping it a secret so we could get our way, and she wanted to use that name after her grandmother death. They are all very upset with us.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701267884, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186qkuf/aita_for_choosing_a_name_my_stepsister_had_in/", "score": 743, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She chose the name first, you know it. It has sentimental value to her and you know it. You could have easily chosen a different name but you didn\u2019t, and you know it. And now you are coming to the internet to try and justify your decision, and you know it ! You\u2019re wrong and you know it. If you don\u2019t care about her feelings as much as you do that name.

It took me a minute to come to this conclusion, because I too share a name (we both have the same middle name) with a cousin of mine. We were both name after our grandmother, however, I am a few years older than my cousin and my aunt discussed using the name with my mother and father BEFORE she gave it to my cousin. Where I understand that the names aren\u2019t completely identical, they sure are so similar that you might as well have used the exact name. Plus, she was naming her child after her deceased grandmother which explains why she is so upset. You knew what you were doing which is why you kept it hidden. That was a cruel thing to do.", "YTA for the shady name stealing, but even more so because you named your baby after a makeup pyramid scheme company.", "YTA but it is in two ways.\n\n1.You knew you shouldn't have taken that name or you wouldn't have hidden it.  \n\n2. You named your child after an MLM", "YTA. Out of all the names in the world, why pick one that your sister has told you that she\u2019s already chosen? There must be billions of names you could\u2019ve chosen and yet you just had to pick one that is as close as it can possibly be to the name your sister chose for her baby to honor her grandmother. \n\nNo matter what you and your husband says, this is just wrong.", "YTA. I am normally team \u2018no one owns a name\u2019 but this is your stepsister, and you have taken half of the name she was giving her baby. \n\nShe chose Mary-Grace FIRST. This makes you TA as you chose Mary-Kay AFTER. \n\nLet\u2019s face it, you knew this would be a problem, and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t tell anyone. \n\nAlso - isn\u2019t Mary Kay the name of an MLM? Personally wouldn\u2019t name a kid the same thing as a pyramid scheme\u2026", "YTA", "Yea gonna have to go with YTA - her name will be shortened to Mary and so you stole her name.

I have other names I like so Evie (her nickname choice) and Evelyn is hers. I value our friendship more than a name. \n\nYou in my view should have valued your relationship with your sister above a name. People are touchy about names especially when they tell you about them first. \n\nAlso someone commented it\u2019s after her (not your) grandmother. So you\u2019re a huge ah for taking that away from her.", "YTA.  You knew she wanted the name first.  You knew there was a family origin to it, not just \"I like the name.\"  Yeah, YTA.  yikes.", "YTA. The names are very close, almost the same. Will be weird if your brother and sister use Mary Grace now. Two cousins close in age with almost the same name. It also does sound like you held back on the name reveal for that reason!", "YTA. How cruel can you be? Names matter, it's not a shirt the baby will grow out of. It's forever. Choosing a baby's name is important, emotional, and challenging. You JUST had a baby, you know that. You let your stepsister do all that work and consideration for her child and then pulled this stunt. Shame on you.", "YTA.", "YTA any person with decent empathy would be bothered with this. It wasn't a secret and you still chose knowing it would cause injury and now your playing the poor me over it because in the end you still got your way.\n\nNot just an asshole I'd go no contact with you and your family.

So sneaky and in poor taste. You knew the name had meaning to your sister, while your version is after a cosmetic company (Mary Kay). \n\n Why would you name a child after a makeup company?

I assume grandma is STEP mother/sister's biological relative. You knew step sister wanted the name and intentionally said nothing until it was too late.

If you were cousins it might be different but sisters having kids with the same name is not something most ppl would like to do. So even a really similar name is almost the same.

It\u2019s true no one \u201cowns\u201d names but what you did was underhanded and you know it which is why you kept it a secret. She chose her name first, you ripped off the name and announced first.

All the names in the world, and you just HAD to do this. Yuck. I\u2019d never speak to you again. Now your kid lost an aunt AND a cousin. Because you\u2019re a child.", "Though I understand your reasoning, you knew the names were very similar and you hid it from her instead of discussing it. Everyone knows baby names are a sensitive topic, so YTA in my opinion. If you were my stepsister, I'd probably cut you off for awhile, possibly for good. It's the keeping it secret that really is so shady.", "YTA, obviously.  You lack respect for your stepsister and could have only done this to insult/harm her.  You knew that major backlash was coming all along.", "I feel like you know you\u2019re out of line or you wouldn\u2019t be here. It\u2019s one thing to coincidentally choose the same name in families if it\u2019s a family name, it\u2019s another to knowingly and secretly choose a name so similar to a step/siblings chosen name that it\u2019s practically identical and then act all shocked pikachu faced when they let you know what you did was a dick move. Do you and your stepsister get along normally? Or is there jealousy and rivalry between you? Because this not only sounds hella rude, it also sounds petty. \n\nTake the YTA vote and consider attempting to smooth this over and admit that you did something very uncool. It\u2019s giving Cinderella\u2019s evil stepsister doing this devious thing behind her back and it will create resentment towards your daughter from her side of the family that isn\u2019t your daughter\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t do that to her or your stepsister. The right thing to do here if you want to make it right is to change your daughter\u2019s name. There are billions of options and you know darn well that your stepsisters sentimental attachment to the name goes deeper than your reasons for liking the name. Plus: Mary Kay is a tacky MLM. Do you really want your daughter to have that connotation with her identity? Kids are mean and I can hear the jokes at school already. Do better.", "Yes, YTA.

My dad and his same-age cousin have the same first name, last name, and middle initial, and are best friends who were inseparable as teens/young adults, and it's never been a real issue (although it was very funny when my dad tried to get them both plane tickets to go on a trip and had to repeatedly explain that he needed two separate tickets because they are two separate people, yes with the same name, and no he was not just buying a second seat for himself and the other person DID need a separate boarding pass). \n\nIf the names really are similar to Mary Kay and Mary Grace...I think my dad's sister and at least 4 cousins are Mary Somethings and they usually go by their second name. In my high school, in one class we had Maryrose, Mary Clare, Mary Faith, Mary Grace, Marybeth, and Mary Kate and everyone was fine. Three of those girls were actually best friends and hung out all the time. Cousins can have the same and similar names.

You knew she chose that name to honour her deceased grandmother and yet you slightly changed it so you could take it and not be the AH well that failed because you are.

You should have made clear then that you would be naming your child what you liked.\n\nI do believe there are certain times when names shouldn\u2019t be repeated or similar - the question about using a sibling\u2019s dead name comes to mind, as does a situation where someone was naming their child the same name as their siblings child who recently passed away.\n\nNot wanting cousins to share a name is not one of those situations.\n\nUnless there\u2019s a cultural or religious reason why this would be taboo that I\u2019m missing I\u2019m going NTA.", "YTA for being sneaky about it but not for using the name.
