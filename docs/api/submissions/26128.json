They worked together, she was his boss technically, and when they got found out, they were both fired from their job. She was his supervisor and it was against the rules to sleep with someone you're in a position of power over. But they also did stuff at work which was against the rules as well. They tried to blame mom and attempted to disparage her to me and others because they were angry mom was so angry at them. My father's wife said she had done nothing wrong and \"did not like the hostility aimed at her, when she was an innocent party\". I was 15 when this all went down. He actually brought this woman into our home and expected us to be kind to her and accept that they wanted to be happy together. He expected me to be more welcoming than I was. I told him to go fuck himself and that I didn't want to be around either of them and they were disgusting.\n\nMy father had every other weekend custody of me through the divorce proceedings but mom and I fought and won the ability for me to decide if I wanted to go to his place or not.

I didn't answer but he left a voicemail. He called me back a few times until I answered. He said how she's not able to work and she's home on her own a lot while he's working. She can't do much for herself and he wanted me to help take care of her and their house. I was like no way in hell am I taking care of his wife. He said if I don't want to do it for them, think of the baby who will be my little brother and he was like surely you'll want a relationship with him. I said *nope*. I won't ever see his new kid and I won't be his kids big brother. My father was saying that's not how you treat family. I told him he ceased to be my family when he decided to try and turn me against mom and brought his side piece into the family home. I told him mom had done nothing wrong. He cheated. And there he was trying to poison me against her. My father argued that it was nothing to do with me. I pointed out he made it something to do with me when he tried to use me.\n\nHe protested some more and said he needs help. I said he can take care of his own wife and when it comes to that, he can take care of his own family and to leave me alone.\n\nHe lectured me about people needing help from time to time and I am being a little shit about this.

That\u2019s pretty telling. His behavior after the affair was discovered plus this? Here is someone who thinks they matter more than others, that their transgressions aren\u2019t so bad because they are special and others should be understanding of them. This is someone who will take whatever is on offer to make themselves happy or have it easier without any thought to damage caused to others.

Worse yet in these scenarios is the fact that an apology once given is treated like the slate being wiped clean without really actually acknowledging the poor choices that at arrived at this situation.\n\nThe kind of forgiveness you're attempting to reach is closer to what I'd describe as, \"indifferent.\" It's a state of mind where you don't really wish ill onto the offending party anymore, you don't seethe about what they did when confronted by the thought of it or their presence, but you still wouldn't put forth much mental energy for them.

You just gotta find what gives you peace or the closest to it.", "Forgiveness might come when someone apologizes for what they did and makes amends for it and becomes a better person.\n\nI am not seeing where he\u2019s met ANY of these conditions.", "People don't think about it this way very often anymore, b/c so many people aren't religious now, but one way to think of it is as not pressing charges. If hypothetically you knew there was a Higher Power & that Power asked you: do you wish/hope for me to punish him for what he did? You can say yes or no; forgiveness is saying no. And it can be limited to that. Just like if a friend steals from you and you choose not to press charges b/c you don't want them to go to jail--that's a separate question from whether you're still friends or not. You can let them off and also not see them anymore b/c the trust is gone.", "You can forgive someone for being, even for the things they did to you and yours WITHOUT forgetting what they did and trusting them or letting them back in your lives, because you are wary enough to know they will hurt you again.\n\n\nForgiveness is different from reconciliation, something people don't realize. One is personal, the other interpersonal.

The opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference. I cut my abusive mother out of my life, forgave her for being a shitty human, even forgave her for her abuse (because it made me resilient and confident about myself). But I knew who she was, and never let her in again from the day I left to the day she died. In death she was just another person, one I neither loved nor carried residual hate.

If the circumstances are so dire, dad and the mistress can hire a caregiver.", "You do understand that op is also someone (a former baby, if that helps you) that did **nothing**, right?", "No interest in having a relationship is not blaming a baby. The child will never miss a person he doesn't have a connection to.", "If he calls you again, say it then", "You seem like you are projecting. He\u2019s not doing anything to the baby. No one is owed a relationship. Family or not. He doesn\u2019t want one and that\u2019s his right. You need therapy for attacking this kid", "Not just a married man, *her subordinate* according to OP. That makes it worse, imo.", "Like it's one thing to be the person if the cheater tells you they are single but there is no way she didn't know he was married. \n\nAnyways OP, you're a good kid. Don't let your dad say otherwise. NTA.", "But she was in love! \ud83d\ude44", "They're both narcissists", "That doesn't sound anything like forgiveness.", "Free-range for both, I take it?", "They are demanding OPs help in hopes that they can day \"see OP forgave us so what we did isn't that bad and you need to also forgive us and help out becausefamily helps family\".", "If the story was true this would be a good question"]}
