I like bathbombs that smell like you have the whole Lush store inside your bathroom. He hates the smell. Well I store them inside an airtight container to avoid contaminating the only bathroom we have with the smell, and when I take a bath with them I warn him sufficiently in advance and air the bathroom out.

You and your wife bought this place together. This was going to be a shared office and BOTH of you need to have equal input into what goes into the office and how it looks. It's called compromise.

You don't mention kids, so it seems like it could be a solution.", "YTA.  But not because you need to get rid of your stuff.  Because you should honor her needs and yours.

Would she feel better if your stuff was displayed in nice glass fronted cabinets?", "YTA. This is showing her that you care more about you and your stuff than on what she thinks and wants. Your selfishness may wind up costing you your marriage if she feels that you think so little of her that you can make a unilateral decision.", "YTA.

I think you had good intentions, but both parties need to be on the same page before a reno starts.  Compromise is #1 importance.

That usually means both people need to discuss big decisions in advance, and they definitely shouldn't surprise each other.", "YTA. You made an executive decision without talking to your wife.

You went about it the wrong way you have to make decisions together not just on your own.", "YTA but only because you blindsided your wife to get your way and what YOU wanted without considering her.

Maybe a cabinet, for example, instead of shelves that are out in the open. I have collections of my own in my office but it's mine alone.

This would only be acceptable if they agreed previously that each person gets a separate half of the room to decorate as they please, as well as where the dividing line would be drawn (who gets the door/windows/electrical outlets if not perfectly symmetric affects how the space can be used). My bf and I will likely share an office/rec room when we get our next place, and I would be pissed if he did anything permanent to it while I was gone.
