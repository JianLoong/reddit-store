I like bathbombs that smell like you have the whole Lush store inside your bathroom. He hates the smell. Well I store them inside an airtight container to avoid contaminating the only bathroom we have with the smell, and when I take a bath with them I warn him sufficiently in advance and air the bathroom out.

You and your wife bought this place together. This was going to be a shared office and BOTH of you need to have equal input into what goes into the office and how it looks. It's called compromise.

You don't mention kids, so it seems like it could be a solution.", "YTA.  But not because you need to get rid of your stuff.  Because you should honor her needs and yours.

Would she feel better if your stuff was displayed in nice glass fronted cabinets?", "YTA. This is showing her that you care more about you and your stuff than on what she thinks and wants. Your selfishness may wind up costing you your marriage if she feels that you think so little of her that you can make a unilateral decision.", "YTA.

I think you had good intentions, but both parties need to be on the same page before a reno starts.  Compromise is #1 importance.

That usually means both people need to discuss big decisions in advance, and they definitely shouldn't surprise each other.", "YTA. You made an executive decision without talking to your wife. The fact that you did it behind your wife\u2019s back shows that you already knew that she would not be in agreement with your renovation idea.

Maybe a cabinet, for example, instead of shelves that are out in the open. I have collections of my own in my office but it's mine alone.

That\u2019s awesome of you to consider moving some of your stuff for her benefit \ud83d\udc4d", "Yeah, I guess... Still a bit sad. I also love music but if I show off my music taste in the decor of the office the worst I'll get will be that people think I'm conceited.\n\nEdit: I didn't meand I though that. I meant that I heard those things before because it happened to me just to talk long about things like music or books. People called me conceited just because I was appasionate while speaking of the things I love (I never show off, is not in my caracter, I have to low autoestima for that lol)\n\nSorry for the confusion, english is not my first language", "Going to bed at the same time as your wife and not neglecting personal relationships in favour of online relationships though.", "... People can put up collectibles in an office room, that doesn't make it not an office room", "Displaying anime figures, unless they're NSFW, is not in any way office inappropriate.", "Because where in the apartment would I put it?? I can't place it in the living room because it wouldn't look nice for my wife as well. In our room, you may have thought, yeah, that wouldn't work either. Those figures have been bothering my wife even before, but I never though they would cause such a big argument. And for your question before. Memories, as in some things I have gotten as a child. How is that so hard to understand?", "when you consider he told her to buy a green screen to cover the displays, i think there\u2019s a lot more than one shelf of figures", "No no, you're right.  I guess we don't actually know if she wanted the whole room to look a certain way or not, but if she did she could be guilty of the same.  If they both came up with their own idea of how they wanted the room to look without consulting each other then they're both in the wrong.  He is however the only one who acted on it", "Yeah I think the fact that OP did this while she was out of town instead of say, running it by her first, speaks *volumes*.", "Just because she didn't act on it doesn't mean it's okay for her to have her own idea for the entire room without OPs input.\n\nEspecially since OP only did his side and left her side alone to do with as she wants.", "Their placement is a problem, the items themselves are not is what I meant. He mentioned his parents issue was that he needed to have grown up interests. A person can be into manga or games and still be a grownup. He is not acting like one because he is putting his interests ahead of his partner", "lol customers in my meetings love seeing fun stuff in the background (software company) - makes for much more fun/natural interactions. My partner in education also has a similar experience.\n\nDefinitely depends on the job tho, can see some caring.", "Depends on the job, no? A lot of people these days work at places that wouldn't give two shits if someone is wearing a graphic tee to a meeting.\n\nI know my job wouldn't care at all.", "Meh. Blur background is a thing.", "They do in Europe", "In Canada three rooms or 4 1/2 would mean two bedroom, one living room, one kitchen and a toilet", "Why would ppl think you\u2019re conceited if you display your musical preference? You do sound conceited.", "Depends on what you do, right? A lawyer who appears remotely in front of a judge or mediator, etc. probably shouldn't have toys displayed because you (a) want to be taken seriously and (b) don't want distractions behind you. I'm a lawyer. The only things visible behind me are books, diplomas, and my license.  Who does the wife interface with?", "This really depends on the field; a sterile and Spartan background is often required.", ">Those figures have been bothering my wife even before, but I never though they would cause such a big argument.\n\nSo, your solution was to put them on a shelf to display them?", "How about an area of a closet where they can be displayed? How about in a cabinet that can be shut?", "This is honestly why geekdom was a big factor for me with my partner. Sharing the same and similar nerdy tastes means our living room/games room looks awesome. Getting his stuff up for him made me happy and I have space for mine. Half of one wall has pop vinyls along the shelf. Another wall has gaming collectibles above the film posters and steelbook display. We've managed to merge our tastes. Now... My parents hate it; they also think it's childish. But we are both working, functioning adults who are both happy with the result. We communicated what we wanted. \n\nHow are you sharing living space at all with incompatible tastes? Does everything in the flat have to be her way or no way? Marriage should involve compromise. If she doesn't want you to display your collection in the living room (public space) or office (shared work space) then you should be allowed to have them in the bedroom.\n\nYou should have discussed this with her. Yes, it is half your office space, but it is still shared and has an impact on her. Cutting her out of the decision entirely makes YTA. It's just childish behaviour. But if she cannot compromise at all to allow you to express yourself anywhere in your *shared* home then that would be E S H. If she has video meetings in that shared space, make sure your side looks professional, or at least any part that would be in camera view. Or maybe rearrange the desks so that her camera isn't looking into your space but towards a wall on her side (I don't know what the space looks like). But it needs to be a dialogue. Not a unilateral decision you make while she's away thinking you'll get your way if you stomp your feet hard enough.", "Sounds like you shouldn't have them on display at all, and you know this.", "This would be like if your wife decorated your office or living room with my little pony or Barbie paraphernalia because *nemories*.", "This made me feel a little sad for you. Why don't you have an area for the things you love? Soft YTA as you should have considered your wife before decorating the office, but she really should be doing the same for you!", "> While renovating I put a shelf full of those figures together with some other stuff.\n\nSounds like one shelf to me", "Not necessarily, It's just that I put the shelf in a place that is quite visible and that makes the figures stand out more. Not the best idea I have realized. But I will rearrange it to a better space if it works out for her.", "The literal definition of a compromise", "i mean yeah she had an idea too, but she still didn\u2019t do anything about it\n\nshe\u2019s upset bc he made the decision to renovate it without telling her his plans", "She's definitely allowed to have ideas and options on how she wants the space seperate from OPs input. She would be an asshole if she unilaterally renovated the room to her vision without including him and compromising so that it's a pleasing space for both of them.", "Let\u2019s go ahead and assume that OP and his wife are both aware of what kind of environment is expected for her work and that since she\u2019s made a stink and he offered a green screen, her job would in fact care.", "My job would not care at all if I had anime figures or gaming memorabilia behind me in my home office. I, however, extremely would care because it is very counter to my \"work persona\" and I would not want to explain that yes those are video game figurines, and no, not mine, my husbands, every time I got on a zoom call.", "That's true, but by no means the default that we should assume.", "Sounds like the policies are the problem then, not the figurines for existing in a shelf on the wall", "What else should he do? Is his house, he can put up figures if he wants to. Why should she get to control every aspect of this?", "Might try this actually.", "Fuck that, if this is meant to be both OPs and his wife's office space then he can put up whatever he wants in his area.", "I can\u2019t believe you have 1000+ top comments when your expert opinion is essentially to tell OP to go fuck himself and that his figures don\u2019t matter because his partner doesn\u2019t like them. \n\nFuck compromises lmao\n\nShocking, but both people should be able to put up some things they like in their home. Even if their partner doesn\u2019t like them. It\u2019s ridiculous to say he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have them on display and knows that.\u201d", "What?! No good solution at all.", "So what if she did? If it's her office space she's welcome to do so.", "No, it wouldn\u2019t be lol\n\nIt would be like if she put up a handful of shelves and put MLP figures on them, and OP would be an asshole to flip shit over it as well.\n\nPeople should be able to put up things they care about. Obviously you might not want MLP in the living room, but MLP in an office space that not many people see should be a fine compromise.\n\nOP just needs to ensure the figures aren\u2019t within her camera background. (Or she could use a digital background.)", "Plenty of people do that and it\u2019s fine. Collecting figurines or vintage toys is a legitimate hobby and not AH behavior. OP is only the AH because he did this behind his wife\u2019s back.", "I'm wondering if by 'shelf' he means 'bookshelf'.", "\u201cwith some other stuff\u201d", "Compromise happens before you make decisions to do things independently, and is agreed upon by both parties. And a green screen based on the wife's response doesn't work based on the size of the room.", "kind of a dumb one, would you want to be putting up and down a sheet every day when video calls come in? Risk knocking off expensive figures each time?\n\nMuch better to move the display to another wall or room.", "And I'm not saying she's wrong to be upset about that, but that doesn't mean it's okay for her to want to do the same thing and design it entirely herself", "I don't think it's fair to assume that at all.\n\nGiven how she's had issues with OP attempting to display those before, not in an office setting, I think it's more likely that she just doesn't like those.\n\nWhich, since they're in his office space, too bad for her.", "Communicate with his wife and not do it when she is gone. Find a common ground.", "Sure, as long as what he puts up does not physically affect her ability to use HER part of the office as an office.  NOTE: the OP had to offer getting a green screen to hide his stuff but then realized it wouldn\u2019t work due to space issues.  \n\nOP got all excited and decided to take the better part of a work space for his toys without even THINKING about his partner\u2019s ability to use the space.", "AND 1.8M karma. \n\nPeople *love* my bad takes.", "Her coworkers see that space. That\u2019s super embarrassing.", "Possible, but that doesn't change anything about what I've said so far.", "Unless it\u2019s the biggest bookshelf ever, it really doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nStandard bookshelves are like.. 18 inches wide and 6 feet tall. Maybe 5 shelves. \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be a huge ask to have ONE bookshelf full of things you like *in your own home.*", "With some other stuff..... ....on the same shelf. I guess I should have written it fully to not cause confusion.", "By this logic you can just rotate the desk and computer. So it\u2019s not a big deal at all. Like less than .05% of a deal", "you\u2019re right there, not gonna disagree with you about that \n\nhowever, he\u2019s not even willing to compromise", "If he offered a green screen as a compromise he knows she can't have them.  He'd rather buy a green screen that she needs to set up every meeting than move them.", "Yes, I suppose we could instead just be troglodytes and assume \u201cwoman bad and liar.\u201d", "By better part you mean his half, right?\n\nI don't see how him putting up anime figures on his side impacts her ability to do work - unless he works in a job that needs a strictly formal professional background, which I don't think we can assume to be the case without any word from OP.", "Good thing my comment mentioned that!  \n\nDoesn\u2019t change the fact 1 shelf isn\u2019t a big ask, and people should be able to display things that their partner might not like. Even if it\u2019s MLP or Barbie.", "Collectors/gamers often have floor to ceiling, wall to wall shelves. But you're correct, it really doesn't matter because he didn't ask. He chose he put it in a location that would require her to use a green screen without her input. It's her home as well.", "don\u2019t worry, i\u2019m in the making fun of you in a light hearted sort of way camp. (i\u2019ve definitely been you)\n\nIt sounds like you found a good compromise", "They're both not willing to compromise, hence my judgement being ESH.\n\nThis is especially evident considering that OPs wife's issue was not just that he started on the renovation already, but that he put up anime figures as well. Which means that even if he had talked to her first, she wouldn't have wanted him to put those up anyway.", "How is that what we're assuming? If she's had issues with him displaying figures before, no matter where, then it makes sense to say her issue is with displaying the figures at all, not just because it makes her background look professional.", "It's not a dorm room with a line of tape down the center of the floor. They're married adults sharing space.", "it seems like she wasn\u2019t a fan of the anime figures because it would be visible from the camera \n\nsomething that could\u2019ve been talked about before he actually went and done did it", "Because she says it\u2019s unprofessional and you\u2019re accusing of her having a different reason, which means you\u2019re calling her a liar. She may have had issues with them before, but never to this extent.", "OP has clarified in the comments that she's just not a fan of OP displaying those figures, anywhere, regardless of visible from her camera or not.", "She's had issues with them before to the extent that OP has never been allowed by her to display them.\n\nShe also didn't say it's unprofessional, just that it destroyed the formal office kind of theme.\n\nBut not all offices need to be formal. And she doesn't get to decide thats the theme they're using for the whole room on her own.\n\nHe also said that she is welcome to come up with a solution as well, that works for both of them. Like, as someone else in this thread suggested, putting the desks facing towards each other so what's on his desk isn't in her background. Perfect solution if the issue is her background and not the figures themselves."]}
