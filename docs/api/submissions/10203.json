Your parent are on the mark saying you are immature.

I like bathbombs that smell like you have the whole Lush store inside your bathroom. He hates the smell. Well I store them inside an airtight container to avoid contaminating the only bathroom we have with the smell, and when I take a bath with them I warn him sufficiently in advance and air the bathroom out.

You and your wife bought this place together. This was going to be a shared office and BOTH of you need to have equal input into what goes into the office and how it looks. It's called compromise.

You do understand it\u2019s her space too right? Why did you do it while she was gone? Did you ask her for any input on the remodel? Did you know she would hate it and that\u2019s why you waited for her to be lot of town?", "YTA. Since it's a 3 bedroom, can you each just have your own office? You don't mention kids, so it seems like it could be a solution.", "YTA.  But not because you need to get rid of your stuff.  Because you should honor her needs and yours.

Would she feel better if your stuff was displayed in nice glass fronted cabinets?", "YTA. This is showing her that you care more about you and your stuff than on what she thinks and wants. Your selfishness may wind up costing you your marriage if she feels that you think so little of her that you can make a unilateral decision.", "YTA.

This sounds like something a 15 year old would do.  Office does not equal gamer space.  She needs the space to work, you want it to game.

I think you had good intentions, but both parties need to be on the same page before a reno starts.  Compromise is #1 importance.

'for both of us' doesn't mean 'fuck your needs - I want it like this'.", "YTA\nMarried life is about sharing and compromising. That usually means both people need to discuss big decisions in advance, and they definitely shouldn't surprise each other.", "YTA. You made an executive decision without talking to your wife. The fact that you did it behind your wife\u2019s back shows that you already knew that she would not be in agreement with your renovation idea.

Maybe a cabinet, for example, instead of shelves that are out in the open. I have collections of my own in my office but it's mine alone.
