Why would you reconnect with someone who ghosted you?  Even the reasoning behind him being sick makes no sense.  He has major issues, huge, glaring, outrageous issues.  Whether or not he has/had cancer is not one of them.", "I was kinda with you til you brought up medication and health insurance. Like, how would you know about these things?  Seems like you're overstepping a line here. I'm not calling AH, I'm more confused than anything.", "Whether he\u2019s actually ill or not, you\u2018re not required to lie for anyone.

He is clearly lying, and its quite a sick thing to lie and manipulate about.", "It does seem like he's lying, so NTA. HOWEVER, he's already an ex AND he set a precedent by ghosting you; I'd say don't bother with him, there's nothing to be gained from this.", "He's totally lying. NTA.", "NTA - he's your ex, and i'm assuming not a friend held in high regard since it sounds like it was not an amicable split, so there's not expectation of trust between you two. You observed behavior that was suspicious, that could have been utilized to manipulate you, so you took the steps to verify if your suspicions are correct, or not.\n\nif we reverse the scenario, and say he was trying to claim he wasn't sick... like with a VD and he was trying to have sex with you, then if you were suspicious then it would be reasonable for you to investigate.\n\nyou contacting his family was a trusted resource you utilized to try to verify your suspicions. nothing wrong with that.", "NTA- he\u2019s a liar. Not the \u201cyeah I love those shoes you\u2019re wearing\u201d when he actually doesn\u2019t give shit kinda liar. But the \u201cI have cancer\u201d when he doesn\u2019t kinda liar.

It might have been wiser for you to just move on instead of confronting him but what\u2019s done is done.  You said you felt \u201cwrong, confused and hurt,\u201d which is reasonable reaction to being lied to so blatantly by someone you cared for.

You have done nothing wrong.", "I had a fast diagnosis and cancer surgery last year. I can say that it is very overwhelming. I only told the people closest to me, and even then it was extremely difficult to keep track of appointments (luckily I didn't need Chemo).\n\nI can imagine that managing his own emotions, his family's emotions, and all the appointments would make it hard to maintain dates and energy in the reltionship. (I was already living with my partner whe I had my surgery. Due to family history with his late grabdnither's tratemanet, his family was very supportive during my diagnosis).\n\nNot only that, but my post treatment has been difficult. There are constant checks in every 6 months to make sure things are on track. I can totally understand if he didn't want to talk about it. \n\nIt sucks to be ghosted. But, and not to sound harsh, it's his choice who to tell about the details of his treatment. It 100% sucks he didn't choose to tell you. But respect that boundary. If you care about him let it go.", "He\u2019s an ex for a reason stop communicating with him.", "YTA - for context here over 20 years ago I dated a man who was diagnosed with brain tumors. He disappeared when he found out. Due to the severity of the tumors he was told life saving measures would only prolong the inevitable. He chose to not go down that road and spent his last days in solitude. Refusing to be seen by family,  friends, health professionals, etc. At the beginning of his diagnosis NOBODY knew because he didn't know how to tell anyone.  By the time he did tell his family he had known for months and would only be around another month or so.\n\nThe gist of my story is this. It's HIS place to tell others NOT yours and there's no reason you should assume he's lieing because he stupidly trusted you with personal information before his family.  He likely felt that conversation was going to be harder than telling you.", "ESH\n\nYou don't have enough information to determine whether he is lying or not. It's not reasonable to expect strangers on the internet to make that decision with *even less* information.\n\nIt's weird to assume at once he's lying about something so serious. And asking around his family is a significant invasion of privacy. On the other hand, you know your ex better than us. Maybe you've noticed some signs he may be a pathological liar that you didn't share here.", "For those asking why I kept in touch. Our families are close, and also have a lot of mutual friends. So we will continue to have social interactions and see each other. Started talking more to establish a friendship again to make those interactions easier on those around us. I have no romantic feelings towards him anymore, but still care as a friend would which is why I was initially shocked by the news and followed up re his wellbeing.", "YTA. He is an ex and it isn't your job to investigate it and check his health insurance, etc. or to have someone else do this investigating for you. As someone who has had cancer and not told people about it until afterwards, it is very possible for it not to be noticeable depending on the type and when it was found. And it is very plausible that people won't want to tell everybody or even anybody, while receiving treatment and sometimes even afterwards. It really is none of your business so just either believe him or not and mind your own affairs and move on.", "YTA. \n\nHe is your ex.  If he is or isn't faking, it's not really your concern.  But the fact that you chose to ask his brother about his medical condition shows that you have a lack of tact.", "YTA. You\u2019re not together anymore and there\u2019s no reason to check his story or try to out him to his family. If he lied about cancer he\u2019s a major AH, but stop being in contact with someone you suspect of lying about cancer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
