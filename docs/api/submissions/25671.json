It didn't matter that I used the same exact form as all the men- I was deemed as sexual merely for having a woman's body. It's a very off putting thing to have happenen **especially** if your father is the one doing it.", "YTA. Do you have any idea how judgmental that sounds? Perhaps your own mother isn't judgmental or you don't care that she is, but mine is - and it's why we are not close to this day (I'm 51). If you want an adult relationship with your daughter, leave these thoughts in your head and really consider how other things may sound to her before voicing them.", "YTA. Jesus lady. She was gardening.", "YTA. even good intentions can go wrong.", "He could see her CLEAVAGE?!  Oh my stars! Where is my fainting couch?\n\nAttitudes like yours only hurt women. \n\nYTA", "YTA", "YTA.\nLeave her alone? She invited you to do something nice, leave the critique at home.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA.  She's gardening.  Please grow up.", "Your her mom, as a woman you've experienced sexual harassment because we all have. Maybe worse, maybe not, but this is you worried about her safety because of what you've been through. Not what she has been through. You need to stop projecting onto your daughter as a way of trying to keep her safe. Getting smaller, taking up less space, hindering what she loves to do, making her self conscious about her clothes and her interactions, makes you the AH. Stop it and talk to her about what's really going on, what your experience has been in the past, how she deals with harassment now, you know real talk.", "YTA. She's an adult and can manage these things herself. Why are you even concerning yourself with watching her cleavage? \n\nAlso, adults don't have to bend over to avoid any little patches of skin to become visible when they bend over *in a community garden, while gardening.*", "Yta", "YTA obviously, because you need to bend over whilst gardening, it's perfectly normal and she shouldn't be made to feel sexualised, judged or otherwise self-conscious for doing perfectly run-of-the-mill things with her body. But also, on a purely practical consideration... you say that her skirt wasn't revealing but you're worried she might have been unintentionally making her cleavage visible, but like, I'm assuming her neckline is at the other end of the bend than her butt, right? So bending with her back to someone means he can't see anything so all is fine, right? I'm just really baffled by how worried you are about the directionality of her bending, among other things.", "YTA. You slut shamed your daughter for gardening.  Should she be wearing a burka?", "Mind your own business. It isn\u2019t okay to police your adult daughter\u2019s behavior\u2014and it\u2019s ridiculous since she seems simply to have been existing in activity-appropriate clothing. YTA", "YTA\n\nIf a guy was shirtless and bending over while working in his garden, no one would question it. Check your internalized misogyny.", "YTA. Also, STFU. This is giving the same energy as my aunt accusing me of giving a Starbucks barista a free show down my top as I picked up my drink from the bar.", "YTA. This is kind of hilarious. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m in the wrong and she wanted to bend over that way on purpose\u201d yeah I bet your daughter was super eager to do some heavy flirting with a guy at the community garden accompanied by her mom! Get a grip OP and stop over sexualising your daughter. All you\u2019ve done now is made her super uncomfortable and put a damper on an activity she probably enjoyed. You should say sorry to your daughter", "YTA. I hope you apologize to her.", "She is gardening not making a porno. Garden requires a lot of back work.", "YTA", "YTA it really takes a lot of effort to ruin an outing to the community garden.", "Yta", "Not at all. I tell my children to be mindful how they should sit and bend over all the time!", "YTA, why you looking at your daughter like that?", "YTA. stop sexualizing your daughter. she gets enough of that from the world, she doesn\u2019t need it from her own parent.", "NTA\n\nUnlike the other comments, I don't think you said this in malice.\n\nSome women are unaware of how their shirts gape, or how their dresses ride up their rear when they bend over. Its reasonable to say \"hey just so you know, your top is gaping massively everything you bend over, and you're accidentally giving that man a full view of your breasts/bra\" (exacerbated if the bra doesn't fit)--same applies if the guys' behind and she's wearing a dress that is too short.", " NTA", "Nta, I get told this time for time and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re calling me a hoe.

NTA", "NTA, if my breasts or too much butt were showing I\u2019d want to know. You weren\u2019t rude and you waited until you could say something privately. To the person asking why it\u2019s always the girl, it\u2019s not. If my son\u2019s penis were hanging out his shorts, I\u2019d say something to him.", "NTA, these younger people find fault in everything said if they don\u2019t like it. Just keep your mouth shut or ignore the face.", "Sometimes I wear red shorts to the gym because they really accentuate the girth of my penis.. I\u2019ll sexualize myself thank you very much!!", "NTAH if she doesn\u2019t understand your point that\u2019s ok but there was no need for her to be an AH about it I am your age and also, whilst understanding that we shouldn\u2019t HAVE to think about these things, I still do as unless I was trying to get his attention I wouldn\u2019t wanna be sticking by a$$ in anyone\u2019s face \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02. The cleavage ehh \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f wouldn\u2019t have even bothered about that", "Nta. She must have manners.", "Info: do you have a picture of the offending bending?", "INFO: did she have underwear and nipples hanging out or something?", "NTA for looking out for your daughters safety", "Oddly specific", "Oops! /s", "Exactly I just told her .. tell the men off if they're being inappropriate otherwise don't worry about it it's not the daughter's problem.. when my daughter gets older I fucking DARE somebody to make a vulgar comment cause she gone learn today how to deal with those people", "Totally. At my gym, there are two adjacent machines where a person at one exercising is basically looking at the chest of the person at the other. Most people are wearing t shirts so no big deal but some guys wear those low cut muscle shirts and some women wear low cut shirts. Either way, I just try to look up or down to avoid cleavage.", "I don't even tell my young kids how to dress, less work for me as long as it's weather appropriate IDGAF... I think OP has good intentions she doesn't want any weirdos creeping on her daughter but unless that happens she should keep her mouth shut", "Seriously, talk about OP outing herself as a lech", "I always garden in lingerie and wellies. I thought that was normal", "The mom was just telling the daughter to be careful as she was flashing the man", "In defense of 60ish women... I would never dream of saying something like that to my daughter or granddaughter, and I am 67.", "I might just be lucky, but if someone made such comments like OP did my 70 year old grandparents would shut them down quick for sexualising and commenting my body", "OP is her mom, not her dad.", "Are your children adult women who are aware of their bodies?", "What's with the down votes?  Serious question.  Sexism?  Misandry? Didn't like the idea she might want him?

And?", "OMG let me run inside and GRAB MY PEARLSSSSSSS", "\u2026.you mustn\u2019t be from the UK. Here calling everyone, friends and strangers alike, pet names like love is perfectly normal.

If you want her to be close to you in adulthood, you need to stop giving her reasons to not open up to you. She now knows that you will judge and criticize her behavior.
