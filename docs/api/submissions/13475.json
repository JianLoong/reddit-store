She\u2019s angry and bitter because she failed and is looking to pass blame to those around her. Hopefully her denial phase is short and she can move on (along with the rest of the family)", "Businesses don't die or thrive because of a graphic design.  They die or thrive because of how they treat their employees.\n\nNTA.", "She wanted you to work for reduced pay because she's your aunt?   Whet kind if messed up thinking is that?  NTA.   She thinks she's entitled to your time and effort.   The business failed because she failed, not you.", "If she didn't have enough money to pay for a crucial part of her business, then that's on her. Money isn't a luxury; it's a necessity. You need it live and Aunt couldn't pay you, so you are very much NTA for realizing that. As for everyone who is blaming you, I didn't hear about them offering to cover your bills, so just ignore them.", "NTA. You've got to pay your own bills. You can't work without compensation.\n\nYour family are jerks. Sorry, there's no way to sugar coat that fact.", "NTA. Her being family doesn't mean she is automatically entitled to your time, effort and money. You did not ruin anything, it was HER business and if she could not afford to fairly pay a worker it is not you fault at all, especially not after you already worked hard and underpaid to help her.", "NTA - and aside from none of this being your fault AT ALL, tell your family a business that can\u2019t stand on its own two feet while exploiting/reducing wages for family labor shouldn\u2019t be a business anyway", "NTA. It\u2019s completely not your fault. First of all your Aunt sounds like not a very nice employer. Secondly, having you do that ad was a blatant attempt to manipulate you. You had already tried to have discussions with her about why you couldn\u2019t continue to work there and she didn\u2019t want to listen to you.

The fact that she said she couldn\u2019t afford anyone else means she was happy to pay you less than you were worth.  In addition, you have your own life to live and aren\u2019t responsible for her business.  If her business went under its on her 100%, not you.", "NTA at all. Little auntie is. She didn't communicate with you about anything, and trying to have you create an ad like it will be some kind of awakening instead of just talking... That's ridiculous. She wanted to take advantage of the family card she had, that's all. Not being able to pay you a living wage in the beginning should have said a lot to you about her, but I get that she is family. You wanted to help. That's totally okay, but you do not get to hold the blame for her failing business. I guarantee that the business would have failed with you by her side anyway. She needed someone else to blame because she probably can't come to terms with herself being a failure.", "NTA if she had wanted you to come back to full time you act like an adult and ask. You don\u2019t get them to make a job posting smh. No one is a mind reader. Also you can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. You did what you had to do to pay your bills and keep yourself in a good place (financially and mentally).

Any business that requires someone's labor to survive also requires enough income to pay that person, or those people, fairly. If the business is not capable of doing that with the current operating model, it either has to change the model (raising prices, finding new suppliers, other changes that do *not* include harming the employees) or the owner(s) have to face the music and shut down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot every business can or should survive, and one that only hangs on because it screws its employees over through unfair wages or breaking the law (things like illegally adjusting timecards/wage theft comes to mind) isn't a business that deserves to survive. Yes, that means owners have to actually put thought into the business model and make hard decisions, but that is the **fundamental job of the owner**. Businesses aren't money printing machines - they're a time-intensive, labor-intensive effort that (should) have a very real risk of failure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that it was an extended family member whose business this was doesn't change the fact that they were TA here, or any of those fundamental rules of business. Your aunt couldn't afford to pay needed labor at a fair rate, so your aunt either needed to learn to do it herself, adjust other aspects of the business, or close. NONE of that is your fault or your concern; don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour time, effort, and knowledge has value. Never, ever forget that. You deserve fair compensation for what you do. Period.", "NTA. Your aunt's business is failing with or without you. It can be hard for people to realize that the marketplace just isn't that interested in their business ideas, but you aren't to blame for this failure.", "NTA\n\nIf your business can't afford to pay a living wage. It does not deserve to be in business. She's hoping to keep her business afloat by taking advantage of family. She doesn't want to hire anyone. Because they will demand too much money. Know your worth.\n\nRemember, for any future job. If during the interview, they say they are like a family. It is a sign you need to run.\n\nEdit: I would add. Only if you wanted to continue. There needs to be something in it for you, if the pay sucks. The business would need to be an investment for you. So, you would need to be compensated with a percentage of ownership too. Then you are working for an investment and gambling it will pay off. The agreement would also be that she has no direct control over you.\n\nThe percentage would come down to how risky the business is and realistic income potential.", "NTA\n\nI don't think any kind of ad would have saved Aunt's business first off. Second there's a much better way to ask someone to work full time:\n\nActually asking.\n\nIf she can't pay you a fair wage you're under no obligation to continue working for her. Feel like you're just being used as a scapegoat because it's the easiest option.", "NTA. My husband worked for his Aunt doing graphic design for a time and had awful hours and was constantly guilted about not doing enough or finishing things fast enough. He eventually quit, the next person after him took leave due to mental duress from her... out of pressure he took the job back and it was a huge regret - he left and never looked back.\n\nFamily can be great but they can also take huge advantage of you. If she wanted you to work full time she should have discussed it with you openly and talked about what you needed to make it happen. I would have also assumed she was hiring someone else if I were in your shoes. It would have been my sign to step away for sure.\n\nYou aren't responsible for your aunt's business. It isn't like you went around bad mouthing it - you just left for your own well being. If she needed to under pay and overwork her employee for the business to function then it wasn't sustainable in the first place. And if you were that vital to it, you should have been paid accordingly.", "NTA.  That bit about the full-time posting being a way to get you to stay is so bizarre.  You don\u2019t have any obligation to work for your aunt.  If the job sucks and you want to leave, you\u2019re completely within your rights.", "NTA - Her business wasn't viable if it required her to exploit her family to survive. Kudos for you for following through and finishing the projects you agreed on before leaving and then holding your ground afterwards.", "NTA - The business failed because your aunts bad business handling. Since she had to reduce your salary it means she was struggling before you even had to quit. \n\nIf she couldn't afford anyone else, then she couldn't afford you. Because you are related doesn't mean you should work there with a reduced salary because \"you are family\". The \"family\" doesn't pay your bills or groceries.", "NTA. This is a personal opinion but helping family with a business isn\u2019t an option if it leaves you struggling. **Not in this economy**.", "NTA she can barely past you but without you her business failed? Sounds like she chose the wrong kind of business, one that was based upon another persons labor and not her own", "NTA she was taking advantage of you. I understand needing a little help, but after a certain time, she would need to pay you reasonably for your time. She has to be able to compete with other jobs you could get or else its not worth it.", "She couldn't pay you a full wage for your work, and you not coming back and working for a cut rate put her business under?\n\nNo, it was failing, and would have failed, regardless. The stress of it failing obviously got to her, as evidenced by her behavior. There's no familial obligation for you to sacrifice your own basic financial needs to prop up her failing business.\n\nRide it out, if you can, and avoid talking about that, even to defend yourself. They're not going to be objective or reasonable about this. If they keep wanting to bring it up and blame you, give them a much smaller allocation of the time and energy in your life.\n\nNTA. Sounds like you made an accurate assessment of the situation, and made sound career choices.", "ESH if her business model depended on barely paying you anything, then it wasn\u2019t sustainable. However, you did your aunt the disservice of not being honest with her, you should\u2019ve told her your concerns and maybe you could\u2019ve worked out an arrangement of $X/per piece that you design for her while you work elsewhere.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
