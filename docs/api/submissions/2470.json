Being judgmental doesn\u2019t exclude anyone from following/believing anything they want and we\u2019re all judgmental at times, but just a bit of advice if you do decide to end the friendship and she asks for a reason don\u2019t say it\u2019s because you think she doesn\u2019t follow the principles. Say that she\u2019s judgmental and you don\u2019t want to be around that or you will be giving her a reason to say your gatekeeping, also remember your both only 18/19 so your both still discovering who you are. Good luck whichever way you decide", "true!! that's good advice, thank you!\ni'm not choosing to end it, nor continue it. just letting it softly be forgotten, so that if we ever cross paths, we greet each other and have an amicable conversation. \nand that's also true!! we are both on the path of continuing ro discover who we are, so who knows what the future holds!!"]}
