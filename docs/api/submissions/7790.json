{"id": 7790, "submission_id": "10gk8oj", "title": "AITA for telling my son's GF that I refuse to accept her mental illness excuses anymore?", "selftext": "My son (21) started dating Amber (21f) 3 years ago and at the end of 2021 she moved in to my house. I allowed it for the sake of my son's mental health or feelings. Her parents were moving out of state and she didn't have any friends or family she could stay with here. I watched my son cry for weeks because his GF had no choice but to move away with her parents and ultimately momma bear came out and protected my son the only way I knew how. So, she moved in but I made it perfectly clear to both my son and Amber that I fully expected rent payments (to cover food and the extra hot water cost). I was only going to charge exactly what the extra cost would have been, which was roughly $400. And also stated that Amber was to get a job. Both of them agreed to this. I even put it in writing and had it filled out as a tenancy agreement so that they could get their own place afterwards and have references for rental history. So the lease was all signed, stamped and notorized. \n\nIn the first couple of months it really appeared like Amber was trying to get a job but after that she just full on stopped giving a fuck. If I asked if she had rent, she would immediately be like \"you know I don't\" and just shrugged it off. My son was paying the entire rent by himself. Which, whatever. If he wants to do that than that's on him. But it was the lack of caring and the complete taking advantage of the situation that pissed me off. After about 7 months I sat Amber down and reminded her of my agreement and told her she was walking on thin ice and that I was fed up with her not even attempting to hold up her end of the deal. She then pulled the \"I understand where you're coming from but try to be sympathetic about the fact that I haven't seen my parents in months and I'm struggling to even get out of bed.\" I did sympathize with this. I even offered to get her to in therapy. She said she would when she felt she was mentally ready. Yeah, that time never came but the excuses stuck. It's always a different excuse but usually has something to do with missing her parents. \n\nWell, this month I saw that my hot water bill sky rocketed by an extra $300. It then came to my attention that Amber has been showering THREE times a day because \"standing under the scolding water is the only thing that takes away my sadness\". At this point I was done. I'm forking out an extra $700 a month with no help from her and my son is struggling to pay her portion because he is in college. So I again told her she needed a job. She pulls the \"I'm so depressed I can barely drag myself out of bed. I can't work outside of this house.\" I snapped and said I refuse to accept her millions of mental illness excuses anymore and either she finds a job within the month or I'm canceling her lease and she can get the fuck out. She ran to the room crying and slammed the door.

She's not even trying to better herself. She's got to go. And until I see papers I wouldn't believe the mental illness either.

OP is not GFs mother. GF is not willing to seek help for her depression. She doesn't have to be perfect but she does have to try.

She can either get a job, or you can, out of sheer kindness, spend a couple (few) hundred bucks and get her a dayum flight to her parents. You'll save money in the long run.\n\nThis isn't about mental illness. It is about boundaries.

I've always been peeved at people who use mental illness as an excuse. It can be an explanation. It's definitely a hurdle. I struggle with my own issues and yeah, I have days I don't leave my bed. But I also know that I still have to go to my job and pay my bills and take care of my responsibilities. Depression and anxiety don't make those things impossible. They can definitely make those things more difficult, but that's why people need to make the effort to learn how to function despite them. It may look different than how most people function, but the specifics don't matter. She can't leave the house? Thank you pandemic, there's a whole lot more WFH jobs available.

It\u2019s worth pointing out that he was trying to get sober when he was with Amber (and is now completely clean and sober) but she sabotaged him by withholding the medication he needed to get through the excruciating pain that comes with withdrawal and by continuing to do drugs and drink around him.

If you let him spread his wings, and be disappointed sometimes, they will push him to grow and he might meet someone for matches his new maturity level.\n\nBy the way, are these kids in school?

You are N-T-A for feeling very understandably bitter about agreeing to allow her to stay in your house, and then having her not fulfill her end of that agreement.

You behaved like TA when you handled the situation in a way that invalidated her depression - dismissing it as \"excuses\". \n\nAs someone who is usually very high functioning, I knew I needed professional help when I went from being towards the top of my class in a demanding graduate school program to literally being unable to do more than sit on a couch for 10 hours each day, rereading books or staring blankly at a wall. I was incredibly fortunate that my social network noticed my issues, absolutely showered me with support, and helped me contact the right people in my school, switch therapists, get a psychiatrist, etc.  Your son's GF might be too overwhelmed to even attend therapy. Depression can make the most basic of tasks, like getting out of bed, feel pointless and draining. It presents differently for everyone.\n\nA better way to handle it would have been to sit your son and his gf down, and then to say something along the lines of, \"We agreed that GF could live here under the assumption that the additional costs would be around $400 per month, which you two would pay. But now, these costs are rising far beyond our expectations, mainly due to GF's actions like taking multiple, long showers a day, and GF is not contributing her share of expenses. I understand depression can be debilitating, but I'm not GF's parent and I'm also not responsible for bearing the consequences of her mental health struggles.

The state I practice at present I walk a dramatically different line whether my patient is civilian or otherwise.  Here, from the civilian perspective side, it\u2019s 96, but good luck getting a PD officer or even an ER doc to do one - with some exceptions (usually the ones with some MH experience).

My personal experience after having dealt with several suicides over my tenure is it it\u2019s better to deal on the side of safety and keeping them alive versus letting them decide and letting them die. Every time I hear about a celebrity committing suicide I think about that. We empower people way too much with their own ability and rights to kill themselves when it comes down to it. If a person is having mental health problems, substance abuse problems, relationship problems or whatever if it seems like it\u2019s affecting their quality of life to the point that something is going astray something is wrong we should air on the side of safety and keeping them alive. It just makes it so much bigger a challenge when they\u2019re over the age of 18.

Because then everything becomes all about OP being cruel and unsupportive. It needs instead to be the obvious and natural outcome of Amber\u2019s own words taken at face value. No need to express skepticism. That\u2019s the subtext and they won\u2019t miss it, but stating it as the reason will backfire.

Do not waver from the POV that Amber is in a downward spiral that is only getting worse. Instead of freeloading for 8 months, say circling the drain for 8 months. Every time Amber says \u201cbecause I miss my parents\u201d OP needs to respond with \u201cthat\u2019s why I\u2019m sending you to your parents\u201d.
