{"id": 7790, "submission_id": "10gk8oj", "title": "AITA for telling my son's GF that I refuse to accept her mental illness excuses anymore?", "selftext": "My son (21) started dating Amber (21f) 3 years ago and at the end of 2021 she moved in to my house. I allowed it for the sake of my son's mental health or feelings. Her parents were moving out of state and she didn't have any friends or family she could stay with here. I watched my son cry for weeks because his GF had no choice but to move away with her parents and ultimately momma bear came out and protected my son the only way I knew how. So, she moved in but I made it perfectly clear to both my son and Amber that I fully expected rent payments (to cover food and the extra hot water cost). I was only going to charge exactly what the extra cost would have been, which was roughly $400. And also stated that Amber was to get a job. Both of them agreed to this. I even put it in writing and had it filled out as a tenancy agreement so that they could get their own place afterwards and have references for rental history. So the lease was all signed, stamped and notorized. \n\nIn the first couple of months it really appeared like Amber was trying to get a job but after that she just full on stopped giving a fuck. If I asked if she had rent, she would immediately be like \"you know I don't\" and just shrugged it off. My son was paying the entire rent by himself. Which, whatever. If he wants to do that than that's on him. But it was the lack of caring and the complete taking advantage of the situation that pissed me off. After about 7 months I sat Amber down and reminded her of my agreement and told her she was walking on thin ice and that I was fed up with her not even attempting to hold up her end of the deal. She then pulled the \"I understand where you're coming from but try to be sympathetic about the fact that I haven't seen my parents in months and I'm struggling to even get out of bed.\" I did sympathize with this. I even offered to get her to in therapy. She said she would when she felt she was mentally ready. Yeah, that time never came but the excuses stuck. It's always a different excuse but usually has something to do with missing her parents. \n\nWell, this month I saw that my hot water bill sky rocketed by an extra $300. It then came to my attention that Amber has been showering THREE times a day because \"standing under the scolding water is the only thing that takes away my sadness\". At this point I was done. I'm forking out an extra $700 a month with no help from her and my son is struggling to pay her portion because he is in college. So I again told her she needed a job. She pulls the \"I'm so depressed I can barely drag myself out of bed. I can't work outside of this house.\" I snapped and said I refuse to accept her millions of mental illness excuses anymore and either she finds a job within the month or I'm canceling her lease and she can get the fuck out. She ran to the room crying and slammed the door.

She's not even trying to better herself. She's got to go. And until I see papers I wouldn't believe the mental illness either.

OP is not GFs mother. GF is not willing to seek help for her depression. She doesn't have to be perfect but she does have to try.

She can either get a job, or you can, out of sheer kindness, spend a couple (few) hundred bucks and get her a dayum flight to her parents. You'll save money in the long run.\n\nThis isn't about mental illness. It is about boundaries.

I've always been peeved at people who use mental illness as an excuse. It can be an explanation. It's definitely a hurdle. I struggle with my own issues and yeah, I have days I don't leave my bed. But I also know that I still have to go to my job and pay my bills and take care of my responsibilities. Depression and anxiety don't make those things impossible. They can definitely make those things more difficult, but that's why people need to make the effort to learn how to function despite them. It may look different than how most people function, but the specifics don't matter. She can't leave the house? Thank you pandemic, there's a whole lot more WFH jobs available. She can't get up in the morning? Get a second or third shift job.

That always seems to be conveniently forgotten.", "No one is AH here .. the gf does show sign of severe depression and depression comes in various forms as well as spectrum. If you have access to her parents number. I would suggest contacting them and telling them what state she is in. This might help you. \n\nYour son crying isn\u2019t the issue but some of the reactions he gave did feel off. They must be having some issues in their relationship as well before his gf went down the spiral. Both of them do require therapy. \n\nI would just suggest to contact her parents and get it sorted even if she is moving out.\n\nI also want to add, yes it\u2019s not uncommon for people to be scared or avoid therapy. I have seen people do that and it\u2019s not because they are faking it or they don\u2019t want to improve because they have lot of myths and feel like it might back fire for them or that things might get worse or if they have certain ideation they might be admitted in a ward.", "This is a comment stealing bot.
