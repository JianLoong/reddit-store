This post doesn't sound to me like it's about helping his brother it sounds like about wanting to control his brother. Obviously these two are not good at communication so I don't know that a trust is going to be a great idea either. It sounds like these two really need some therapy. But I'm pretty skeptical about Op. It just sounds off, and honestly if the money was raised for his brother then it goes to his brother. I don't know why somebody would be power tripping like this. You raise the money and you give it to the person it's intended for, then they can do whatever they want with it.\nI think typically when other people are raising funds through GoFundMe for someone else there is a significant conversation beforehand where they establish boundaries and how the money will be spent. \nThis whole situation is messy and Op didn't seem to speak with their brother before doing this GoFundMe. It just all reeks of control and financial manipulation. Why wouldn't you tell your brother ahead of time that you were going to do something like this?! Unless it's to make yourself look good,feel powerful and control your brother. This post just gives me the feeling like something is very off.", "Absolutely agree with you! OP is shady.", "OP isn\u2019t keeping the money, just making sure it actually gets used for the purpose it was donated for, which is the brother\u2019s medical expenses. Did you actually read the post?", "How is this fraud? The money was donated for the brother\u2019s medical bills and OP is making sure it gets used for the brother\u2019s medical bills.", "It says on gofundme that OP can receive the money and you know what would be fraud? If the brother used the money else where instead of paying the medical bills. The people are gonna be pissed and OP can eventually get sued if his brother uses his money else where like some of yall really really need to learn how to read. NTA", "You know what \"comprehension\" is, yes? Specifically, reading comprehension. You know what an \"assumption\" is, yes?", "Technically, it wasn\u2019t raised for the brother, it was raised for the brother\u2019s medical costs. And OP is making sure that that\u2019s what the money is used for.", "OP didn\u2019t raise money for the brother to use as he wants, it was raised for the brother\u2019s medical bills. And since OP raised the money, OP is the one who would be in trouble if the money is used for anything else.", "GFM specifically says that the person can receive the funds in behalf of the recipient...as long as the funds go towards what they're raised for, there's no fraud and therefore it's not an issue.", "You might want to reread", "The money was raised for expenses as related to the medical issue. OP is absolutely justified to keep it in an account to continue paying those expenses.", "What do taxes have to do with this?", "Definitely want the rest for future bills. Sometimes for whatever reason. Some medical office could be a straggler and give you a bill a year or two later. The messed up way medical systems are setup. There could be independent providers who were part of the care in the hospital. Who do their own billing.", "Or spend it on accommodations that are not directly medical bills but related to his health crisis (i.e. a humidifier if it's a problem with his lungs, or a grab bar and shower chair if it's a physical injury that makes him unsteady on his feet).", "It sounds like not medical bills since the OP says *pay ahead on his bills*. That sounds more like utilities etc than medical bills\n\nHospitalizations can also have a lot of hidden costs which he may be paying for that OP is unaware of or sees as lazy etc. Like when my partner was injured at work, he couldn't physically cook for himself. I made most of the meals and packed him a lunch to stay beside the bed etc in a cooler but occasionally he needed to order food if I was delayed coming home.  Even costs like more toilet paper etc because you are home more add up if you have been off work with no income", "Did you start the GoFundMe in state specifically that it was only for medical bills? Or did you say medical related expenses? Regardless your brother as long as he's of sound mind, even if he's immature and not financially responsible, it does not entitle you to withhold the money and spend it how you see fit. If you are not your brother's guardian you should not be touching that money. Just because go fund me says something doesn't mean that you're in the clear. You better be looking at all of the laws because your brother could definitely sue you. I think you need to stop being so controlling and if your brother is going to use the money and blow it that's on him. You raise the money for your brother, so you need to give it to your brother. You don't get to dictate how somebody uses a gift. If you buy somebody a mug for Christmas and they use it as a planter would you have a fit?\nIt's the same ethical principle here. I understand the concern but it's not up to you how the money is spent. And if you start spending that money, that is intended for your brother you're probably going to end up being sued by your brother and you're probably going to lose.\nIs that really what you want for your family and your relationship in the future? Or can you just do a kind thing and let it go?", "Can you please stop parroting? Jfc", "Definitely!\nIt took 6 months for me to receive a bill of over $1,500 when I went to the emergency room last October...on top of so many other bills I had already received and paid! \n\nI was furious \ud83d\ude20...I  have been sending $50-$100.00 per month since receiving that bill. I figured they took 6 months to bill me... I will take my time to pay it.", "He can give / send op  those electronically and op can pay if there is money after paying hospital bill. If the brother isn't the best with money and since op signed the contract with go fund me that the money goes for medical bills I wouldn't give him the money either so I can be liable for breaking the contract I signed and land me in hot water when I didn't do anything wrong but tried to help.", "No, but OP is the one who raised the money so OP is the one who would be in trouble for fraud if the money gets used for anything that isn\u2019t the brother\u2019s medical expenses.", "polly want a cracker? no! polly want a cracker? no!", "GFM specifically says that the person can receive the funds in behalf of the recipient...as long as the funds go towards what they're raised for, there's no fraud and therefore it's not an issue.", "That so pisses me off.
