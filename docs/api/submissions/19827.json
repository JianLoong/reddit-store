We are gone from home for five days. \n\nOur six- and nine-year-old are great travelers and have been since they were babies. Our toddler is, to put it mildly, not.

We are paying for their entrance, food, lodging, souvenirs, etc., in exchange for some childcare. We all make a Con schedule and trade off the kids. \n\nOur toddler COULD come with us, and he would love the sights and sounds. He came last year and had a marvelous time.

I doubt it will even phase him.\n\nNTA if you have a reliable and safe babysitter for him.", "NTA\n\nIf he is going to be with people he knows and trusts as well as doing things he likes he will be fine.  At that age he will have no interest in what the Con is about while everyone else there will.  You can take him to future ones when he is older and can appreciate the Con itself.\n\nHowever I would definitely arrange for some sleepovers first to get him used to it.", "NTA. He's 2.5 dude. He's  not going to feel left out when y'all get home and gush about it. He's going to be happy to see his family. Go and have fun with the older kids and your nephews. You are allowed to do things without including all of your kids. That's what keeps us parents sane.", "NTA why make him be mister able for 10 hours (each way?) in order to have a little fun he won't remember anyway, while you're there.", "Why not pay for him to have a night or two as practice at his babysitter's ahead of time?\n\nHe will then probably look at it as an adventure or treat and you will feel more comfortable.\n\nThis would be so much better for everyone.", "NTA. I'd do an overnight first tho to test it out. And let each sibling bring him back a little souvenir.", "NTA. Your kid is only two and a half years old.

As much as he might enjoy it, his pressence will make everyone else's experience worse, let alone the trip there absolutely miserable. I've been to cons, and I can say they are not really a place suitable for a toddler. Perhaps when he's older you can consider bringing him along, but for now do what you deem best for your children. I'm sure your toddler and the babysitter can have lots of fun on their own.", "NTA \n\nCan you do sleepovers first to get him used to them?", "NTA I'm an avid congoer myself and even though I'm not a parent the fact that you're driving for ten hours with a toddler that behaves the way he does would be exhausting and irritating. When you go to a con you want to be able to have fun and enjoy yourself while socializing with fellow nerds. Not being stressed out the entire time. Also, he's not going to remember it anyway I didn't remember anything from when I was 2 and a half. Just help him get used to being away from your family in advance and see how it goes.", "NTA both my kids are young and although I haven\u2019t travelled at length with them I do often do day trips with one or the other. Although I\u2019m sure he would have fun it may not be age appropriate for him and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Enjoy the time with the older kids", "NTA.  He\u2019s 2.5.  Kids that age don\u2019t have much concept of \u201cmissing out.\u201d  He\u2019ll have fun with his grandparents or babysitter or whoever.  At his age, going to a splash pad or playground or watching trucks at a construction site is just as exciting as going to a convention 10 hours away.  It sounds like he\u2019s not really at the age to enjoy a 10 hour trip, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with leaving him with a caregiver.  I would suggest doing some overnights and maybe a couple weekend visits with his grandparents or babysitter to get him used to staying with them before your trip.", "NTA. Sounds like you would be TA if you took the kid and he ruined everyone else\u2019s trip.", "NTA You are feeling parent guilt, which is super common. If you have a reliable babysitter and he\u2019ll have fun, let him hang out there and have his own adventure. He won\u2019t remember it, plus next year he\u2019ll be a little older and may be better with car rides. Maybe plan another trip somewhere closer soon after you get home with him and his siblings.", "the only thing is you really need to do a test first. five days is A LOT of time for a kiddo that's never been away overnight. that could be a nightmare", "NTA.  He\u2019s 2.5.  As long as everyone is on board with the childcare it\u2019s fine.  People do these sorts of things all the time.  \n\nJust maybe spend some quality time with him when you get back.", "NTA.  Everyone wins if you limit the participation/car-ride from hell.", "NTA. Enjoy your trip. He will have fun where he stays just doing normal toddler stuff.\n\nHave a practice run and send him for a one night sleepover at the chosen home so he gets used to it and it's not such a big thing when you do go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So if I were you I'd try to find a way to make him more comfortable in the car or entertained, or make something to train him to car rides.", "NTA\n\nKids don\u2019t need to be included in EVERYTHING and some parents don\u2019t understand this. In circumstances like this is perfectly fine to take some time and enjoy a trip. There\u2019s nothing abusive about putting a child in day care or having them taken care of while parents go on vacation. I honestly wished a lot more parents could get on this wave. It\u2019s okay to still be an individual when you have kids.", "YTA your a parent bringing your kid with you especially to something you know they\u2019ll not only enjoy but love to be at it what you signed up for further more if the toddler limits what people can do and or see you should exclusively be responsible for him instead of trying to give him to your nephews who have had far less experience at this con.", "YTA. You have three children. Just leaving behind one is extremely unfair. Also this is something that will lead to problems years down the line when he sees photos of this trip.", "NTA.  My biggest concern is leaving him with someone he is totally comfortable with.  That might be his babysitter as she is likely part of his regular life.  He's 2.5 and will quickly forget all about everything except his discomfort if he's left with someone he's not completely comfortable with.  Enjoy your trip!", "NTA.  I know plenty of parents who've left their kids with grandparents or family/family friends for a con weekend.   It's a weekend it's not forever", "NTA, but it's worth getting him (and all your kids, really) used to staying overnight elsewhere before you go. Can you arrange a single night trial run before you go away to get him used to the idea?", "NTA. I would make it seem really cool that he gets to stay with his grandparents or whoever. Let him pick out new pajamas and an overnight bag if he wants to. Just really hype it up. \n\nI would also probably let him stay a night or two beforehand, just so it isn\u2019t as big a deal.\n\nAlso, when you\u2019re gone, you can FaceTime often.", "NTA. A 2.5 year old's idea of a good time is getting a squishy ball for 2 hours. He won't be offended or feel left out. As a frequent con attendee, cons aren't a great place for a toddler, especially one so young. Plus, his needs will hinder your whole party's experience. Having a toddler randomly scream or whine during a panel or get grabby with booths in the vendor hall or artist's alley is also not ideal. Not to say your toddler will but the vendors I know get super antsy when toddlers come by, even in strollers. \n\nKids don't really need to feel included until they're around 5 anyway. My nephews stayed at home for a lot of events until they were that age because they got bored and acted out due to boredom or even being overwhelmed. They take part in plenty of stuff now and actually have good memories. Your toddler will be fine with his grandparents/babysitter.", "INFO: can you give him some sensory stimulation like a dvd player or something?", "NTA. At that age, I highly doubt he's going to remember it. It's not as if he's eight and you're taking the rest of the family to Disney Land. He'll be a grumpy toddler at a Con. \n\nWhy not try small steps at first, if you have time. Leave him with the sitter overnight and see how it goes. Get him used to the idea that yes, you're leaving without him, but that you'll come back.", "I don't know if this is an AH thing, but I think a five day trip would be really hard to start out with. Is there any way you could try an overnight first, so that if there are major issues you can try to troubleshoot them, so that something doesn't come up for the first time when you're 10 hours away and with a big group that is planning to settle in for five days?\n\nETA: Just giving some advice from a former nanny (and a former anxious child lol), even if you can't have him do a proper overnight, just going out and having someone else do his full bedtime routine might be useful, if that hasn't happened before. I've had kids I've babysat or nannied for who knew me and trusted me and still freaked out the first time I did bedtime and their parents weren't in the house.", "Definitely not unreasonable or even slightly bad.\n\nUnless his grandparents are estranged or unpleasant people, I can't imagine that asking if he can visit them or have them come visit isn't the best possible solution.", "NTA- I've recently been discussing past trips with my kid and they do not remember swimming with sea turtles in Hawaii at 4. You're cool dude.", "YTA!! This is a family trip and an annual tradition. He is a full-fledged human being. \n\nPlan for the trip to take longer\u2014take breaks, problem solve the issues. You don\u2019t just leave one child out of the family because they\u2019re inconvenient to have around. \n\nAlso, what values are you modeling for the older children? Is that how you want them to treat loved ones?\n\n(Edited for grammar)", "YTA. You don\u2019t want your 3 year old to be part of your family. \n\nIt\u2019s your goddam kid, you look after it. FFS", "Get him used to the idea that yes, you're leaving without him, but that you'll come back.", "Faze", "This makes sense.", "Exactly. That is what I did with my 2 year old when I was having a baby. And definitely made her understand that we wouldn't be there. 2.5 is definitely old enough to prepare him that you guys need to go away but he's going to have an extra special time with babysitter/grandparents. Splurge some extra money so they take him to some of the coolest stuff near them and get some special treats. Take him out to his favorite place the day you get home.", "Yeah, and if any issues arise, then they can troubleshoot after one night, instead of when they're 10 hours away and planning to be gone for five days.", "If the toddler can't handle a car ride properly, I highly doubt flying would fair much better, let alone subjecting hundreds of people to a loud and screaming toddler on a plane who can't sit still.", "Knowingly subjecting 200 people to a bad traveler toddler when there are other options is an AH move too.", "I don't think this is a bad idea, per se, but a 10 hour drive is a lot for one adult to take on. Even if the 17 year old has a license and can do some of the trip, it might be difficult. I recently did a 14 hour drive with two other drivers and we were still having a little trouble by the end of it.", "Yep. I was an only child and I travelled well (i was used to 10+ hours in a car for a trip), and my parents took a few trips without me that I can recall. As a toddler, I don't remember, as a small child, I didn't really care and as an adult, I can fully understand why they did what they did and I'm not upset at them in the slightest.", "I agree with this to an extent: I think that OP ought to do a one-night test first. Because kids can be weird about this stuff. I used to be a nanny, and although I'd been working with a family every day for months while the parents were at work, the first time I stayed late (the parents had a date night and would be back after the kids' bedtime) their toddler freaked out that mom and dad weren't there for bedtime. \n\nI managed to handle the situation, but it did come up again a few times, and dealing with bedtime was always a bit stressful, even after he was used to it, because sometimes he would still get anxious. I think that getting a kid used to someone else doing the bedtime routine and then mom and dad being there the next day, at least once or twice, might make things easier for OP's son than suddenly going five days.", "This shouldn\u2019t be attempted on a family trip at the expense of everyone else attending though.", "Where does it say she is giving him to the nephews?  He's 2 1/2, probably won't even remember.", "It definitely won't turn him into a gaseous form.", "Miaki", "While you\u2019re correct that the toddler might not fare better in a plane, the plane trip (dependent upon starting location and destination) is likely to be significantly shorter than a 10-hour car ride. \n\nThe reality is, OP is perfectly fine to leave the toddler with family while the go to the convention. The kid is eventually going to need to learn how to handle being in a car, but not at the expense of everyone else for 10 hours.", "Idk, my daughter hates the car (not to this extent) but LOVED flying. Plus it\u2019s shorter. And they have more mobility compared to being trapped in a car seat since you can have them on your lap, walk up and down with them, stand and rock them etc.", "I'm talking in general, because if the solution is always going to be to leave him behind, then how is he going to get used to car travelling.  I'm saying that the main issue here is bigger than this particular trip, and that is a thing they should consider addressing.", "Kids are *most* annoying at their triple point.", "Isn't that *Miyake*?", "While shorter, yes, I just believe that knowingly subjecting hundreds of strangers to the wailings of a 3 year old when there are other perfectly reasonable and viable solutions would make someone an AH. While yes, the toddler should get use to car drives, subjecting them to a 10 hour one before even knowing how to handle one isn't the correct way to do it, especially if it'll make 6 other people absolutely miserable.", "I'm sure the child is transported by car in other situations. Like going to the doctors, or to a pre-k, or hundreds of other daily activities. They're not lacking other opportunities to address the main issue.", "My turned 2 over 3 months ago, my sister won't take her on really long car trips. Maybe it'll change when she's older but as it is they try to time driving 2-3 hours with her nap & wouldn't do a 10 hour car trip.\n\nMaybe once they kid is a bit older they'll be able to cope better with being in the car.", "Kind of want this on a tshirt now", "I agree it isn\u2019t ideal to subject hundreds of people to a cranky toddler, as someone who flies often, the reality is that you\u2019re going to have to deal with angry/restless toddlers, drunk and rowdy passengers, and people just ill-equipped to efficiently travel in general. People have to get where they are going though.\n\nIf I were OP, I would have zero qualms leaving the kid with family members, but I would also choose a short plane ride each way than a 20-hour round trip drive with or without a toddler having a meltdown."]}
