We are gone from home for five days. \n\nOur six- and nine-year-old are great travelers and have been since they were babies. Our toddler is, to put it mildly, not. He is sensory-seeking and kinesthetic and hates being trapped in a car seat. He screams intermittently just to hear his own voice. He is crying or whining at all times in the car unless he\u2019s asleep. He\u2019s also highly verbal and worships his older siblings, who in turn adore him. \n\nThis year (like last year) we are also taking our nephews (15 & 17) along with our older children. We are paying for their entrance, food, lodging, souvenirs, etc., in exchange for some childcare. We all make a Con schedule and trade off the kids. \n\nOur toddler COULD come with us, and he would love the sights and sounds. He came last year and had a marvelous time. But the car ride was truly awful, and his presence curtailed what the rest of us could see and do. \n\nHe could also stay with his babysitter (who feels like a bonus parent to him) and/or his grandparents (who are more distant but trustworthy).

I especially appreciated hearing from people who were went on or were left home from trips as small children and their feelings then and now, as well as other parents.

Also, he's not going to remember it anyway I didn't remember anything from when I was 2 and a half.

At his age, going to a splash pad or playground or watching trucks at a construction site is just as exciting as going to a convention 10 hours away.  It sounds like he\u2019s not really at the age to enjoy a 10 hour trip, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with leaving him with a caregiver.

You have three children. Just leaving behind one is extremely unfair. Also this is something that will lead to problems years down the line when he sees photos of this trip.", "NTA.  My biggest concern is leaving him with someone he is totally comfortable with.  That might be his babysitter as she is likely part of his regular life.  He's 2.5 and will quickly forget all about everything except his discomfort if he's left with someone he's not completely comfortable with.  Enjoy your trip!", "NTA.  I know plenty of parents who've left their kids with grandparents or family/family friends for a con weekend.   It's a weekend it's not forever", "NTA, but it's worth getting him (and all your kids, really) used to staying overnight elsewhere before you go. Can you arrange a single night trial run before you go away to get him used to the idea?", "NTA. I would make it seem really cool that he gets to stay with his grandparents or whoever. Let him pick out new pajamas and an overnight bag if he wants to. Just really hype it up. \n\nI would also probably let him stay a night or two beforehand, just so it isn\u2019t as big a deal.\n\nAlso, when you\u2019re gone, you can FaceTime often.", "NTA. A 2.5 year old's idea of a good time is getting a squishy ball for 2 hours. He won't be offended or feel left out. As a frequent con attendee, cons aren't a great place for a toddler, especially one so young. Plus, his needs will hinder your whole party's experience. Having a toddler randomly scream or whine during a panel or get grabby with booths in the vendor hall or artist's alley is also not ideal. Not to say your toddler will but the vendors I know get super antsy when toddlers come by, even in strollers. \n\nKids don't really need to feel included until they're around 5 anyway. My nephews stayed at home for a lot of events until they were that age because they got bored and acted out due to boredom or even being overwhelmed. They take part in plenty of stuff now and actually have good memories. Your toddler will be fine with his grandparents/babysitter.", "INFO: can you give him some sensory stimulation like a dvd player or something?", "NTA. At that age, I highly doubt he's going to remember it. It's not as if he's eight and you're taking the rest of the family to Disney Land. He'll be a grumpy toddler at a Con. \n\nWhy not try small steps at first, if you have time. Leave him with the sitter overnight and see how it goes. Get him used to the idea that yes, you're leaving without him, but that you'll come back.", "I don't know if this is an AH thing, but I think a five day trip would be really hard to start out with. Is there any way you could try an overnight first, so that if there are major issues you can try to troubleshoot them, so that something doesn't come up for the first time when you're 10 hours away and with a big group that is planning to settle in for five days?\n\nETA: Just giving some advice from a former nanny (and a former anxious child lol), even if you can't have him do a proper overnight, just going out and having someone else do his full bedtime routine might be useful, if that hasn't happened before.

Splurge some extra money so they take him to some of the coolest stuff near them and get some special treats. Take him out to his favorite place the day you get home.", "Yeah, and if any issues arise, then they can troubleshoot after one night, instead of when they're 10 hours away and planning to be gone for five days.", "If the toddler can't handle a car ride properly, I highly doubt flying would fair much better, let alone subjecting hundreds of people to a loud and screaming toddler on a plane who can't sit still.", "Knowingly subjecting 200 people to a bad traveler toddler when there are other options is an AH move too.", "I don't think this is a bad idea, per se, but a 10 hour drive is a lot for one adult to take on. Even if the 17 year old has a license and can do some of the trip, it might be difficult. I recently did a 14 hour drive with two other drivers and we were still having a little trouble by the end of it.", "Yep. I was an only child and I travelled well (i was used to 10+ hours in a car for a trip), and my parents took a few trips without me that I can recall. As a toddler, I don't remember, as a small child, I didn't really care and as an adult, I can fully understand why they did what they did and I'm not upset at them in the slightest.", "I agree with this to an extent: I think that OP ought to do a one-night test first. Because kids can be weird about this stuff. I used to be a nanny, and although I'd been working with a family every day for months while the parents were at work, the first time I stayed late (the parents had a date night and would be back after the kids' bedtime) their toddler freaked out that mom and dad weren't there for bedtime. \n\nI managed to handle the situation, but it did come up again a few times, and dealing with bedtime was always a bit stressful, even after he was used to it, because sometimes he would still get anxious. I think that getting a kid used to someone else doing the bedtime routine and then mom and dad being there the next day, at least once or twice, might make things easier for OP's son than suddenly going five days.", "This shouldn\u2019t be attempted on a family trip at the expense of everyone else attending though.", "Where does it say she is giving him to the nephews?  He's 2 1/2, probably won't even remember.", "It definitely won't turn him into a gaseous form.", "Miaki", "While you\u2019re correct that the toddler might not fare better in a plane, the plane trip (dependent upon starting location and destination) is likely to be significantly shorter than a 10-hour car ride. \n\nThe reality is, OP is perfectly fine to leave the toddler with family while the go to the convention. The kid is eventually going to need to learn how to handle being in a car, but not at the expense of everyone else for 10 hours.", "Idk, my daughter hates the car (not to this extent) but LOVED flying. Plus it\u2019s shorter. And they have more mobility compared to being trapped in a car seat since you can have them on your lap, walk up and down with them, stand and rock them etc.", "I'm talking in general, because if the solution is always going to be to leave him behind, then how is he going to get used to car travelling.  I'm saying that the main issue here is bigger than this particular trip, and that is a thing they should consider addressing.", "Kids are *most* annoying at their triple point.", "Isn't that *Miyake*?", "While shorter, yes, I just believe that knowingly subjecting hundreds of strangers to the wailings of a 3 year old when there are other perfectly reasonable and viable solutions would make someone an AH. While yes, the toddler should get use to car drives, subjecting them to a 10 hour one before even knowing how to handle one isn't the correct way to do it, especially if it'll make 6 other people absolutely miserable.", "I'm sure the child is transported by car in other situations. Like going to the doctors, or to a pre-k, or hundreds of other daily activities. They're not lacking other opportunities to address the main issue.", "My turned 2 over 3 months ago, my sister won't take her on really long car trips. Maybe it'll change when she's older but as it is they try to time driving 2-3 hours with her nap & wouldn't do a 10 hour car trip.\n\nMaybe once they kid is a bit older they'll be able to cope better with being in the car.", "Kind of want this on a tshirt now", "I agree it isn\u2019t ideal to subject hundreds of people to a cranky toddler, as someone who flies often, the reality is that you\u2019re going to have to deal with angry/restless toddlers, drunk and rowdy passengers, and people just ill-equipped to efficiently travel in general. People have to get where they are going though.\n\nIf I were OP, I would have zero qualms leaving the kid with family members, but I would also choose a short plane ride each way than a 20-hour round trip drive with or without a toddler having a meltdown.", "NTA. He\u2019s 2.5", "NTA - as others have said, you\u2019re overthinking this a bit. As long as you have a safe, trusted babysitter there\u2019s no issue.

I have a 4yo who has global delays and the car rides aren\u2019t always easy for her or us, but we plan vacations that she enjoys so it\u2019s worth it so that she can get those experiences. Additionally, she will never learn to tolerate the travel if we leave her behind. I get that they don\u2019t remember, but you will remember.", "Yeah, I have a kid that age, and there's no way I would take them to something like that. NTA, he won't remember or care.  The rest of your group will probably be happier without having the added stress of checking in with a toddler at a less than toddler friendly event,  too. \n\nHave a wonderful time!", "Going from never being apart to a full five days is a lot of adjustment for a little one. It seems to me that preparing for a long trip with smaller stays with others would be good for him and make it easier on all when the big trip arrives. Otherwise, I don\u2019t feel like you are in the wrong for not taking a child who isn\u2019t quite old enough to completely enjoy the trip or deal with the drive. \n\nI once hired a reliable babysitter for a river rafting trip I wanted to enjoy with older family members when our youngest was too small. She and the baby stayed in an air conditioned cabin we rented for the day while we were on the water. Then we all spent the evenings together.

I had a great time having one-on-one time with them. New toys, ice cream and other treats, going out into the field behind their house to forage for wild strawberries, visits with relatives who lived in my grandparents' town. The only time I felt left out was when I'd see photos of their trip. However, four years later when I was older and could endure a long car trip we all returned to see those out-of-state relatives.\n\nYou can make the trip again when your toddler is old enough to endure a long car trip.", "NTA. Two and a half is usually a good age to start visiting grandparents etc. for a few days. Having quality alone time with good adults is golden especially for younger siblings.", "I say go without him and have fun.\n\nAlternative solution would be to drive at night also. If the only time the child is oknwith being in a car seat is if they're asleep, travel while they're asleep. Get to the destination a day early if possible and/or have the parents switch driving so that one arrives ready to handle the kids while the other one naps. Or plan a very relaxed first day.\n\n\nHave fun!", "NTA. I often think parents do things more for themselves than their infants and toddlers.

Honestly it would be great for the relationship with your older kids to have a baby sibling free week. The little one often sucks up all the air in the room because their needs are so high.

He got quality time with his grandparents and they still talk fondly about those trips to this day. They had him at the zoo, fishing with grandpa, swimming in their pool, going to Dairy Queen which we don't have by us and generally eating like a king. He loved it and we loved the brief break from being parents of a toddler.\n\nDon't feel guilty.", "YTA. Maybe he won\u2019t understand right now, but at some point, he\u2019s going to learn that his parents have excluded him from trips. (And are you going to keep excluding him as he gets older?) And you even say he\u2019s better when he\u2019s actually at the destination. So either change up the mode of transportation or try to do something to make the trip easier for your kid. Lots of toys, lean heavily into the tablet. Have you also considered whether your kid gets motion sickness?\n\nI\u2019m all about taking trips without your children. But taking SOME kids and not others just seems like a recipe for trouble.", "I go YTA but only because you didn't \"train\" him to get used to overnight stays before leave him for five days. That's cruel for both baby and sitter.", "YWBTA", "I don't think AH is the correct description but this child Will know, as he gets older, that he was left out of this.  Staying w/ family members is Not the same as a family vacay/con.  This is Your child and his issues are yours to deal with as long as he is a minor.  That said I am sure you would not be the first parents to leave a toddler with a babysitter if they felt they would ruin their vacation.", "I also think OP could frame the toddler's week as its own special event ahead of time. \"You get to spend 5 whole days hanging out with X!\" \"You're going to do so many fun things with grandma!\" etc. And then ask lots of questions about what they did when you're back.\n\nThat's my advice, OP. Don't think of it as the toddler missing out on this experience; he's just going to have a more age-appropriate adventure of his own!", "This ^", "I don't think a 10 hour car ride is a skill he has to master as a toddler.  He'll probably be more comfortable when he's a few years older.", "I really appreciate this suggestion. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible for a few reasons, but thank you for trying to find a win-win.", "Modeling that if you suck we will leave you at home, shape up kids", "It\u2019s not for a few months yet. We have time!", "Thank you. I see people constantly using \u201cphase\u201d instead of \u201cfaze\u201d on here and it drives me nuts.", "Exactly. This happened to me once when I was a little older than this kid, and my mum wanted to take my older siblings on a trip where it'd be difficult to have me along since I was a lot younger and mum was a single mum. What little I remember now is just the massive hyping up she did about me getting to stay with my favourite \"aunt\" and the amazing things we'd do together and the gifts I'd get when they came home, etc. I can't even remember where they went, but I do remember my aunts doggo that slept in bed with me and how for once it was just me (aunt was single with no kids) getting aaaaall the attention and got to pick food, choose movies, etc, without anyone else's needs having to be considered.\n\nIt was a dream come true. According to mum (this part I don't remember) I didn't even want to go home with them when they came to pick me up. \ud83d\ude01", ">he's just going to have a more age-appropriate adventure of his own!\n\n100% that. Don't force a toddler on a long road trip when it will be stressing for everyone. The practice rounds are a very good idea.", "Good, than I strongly suggest to start ASAP. Our toddler was completely OK with staying with MIL for over a week when we went to our honeymoon, but he was staying with her overnight from 18 months and we gradually prolonged the period from one night. He never stayed with my mom (nothing wrong with her, she's just bit older and doesn't have that much energy to deal with him, he has diagnosis). I wouldn't leave him there for five nights straight (you know from zero night directly to five nights). It would be hell for both of them.", "just go for the stun setting", "That's the 1", "Same here", "Something that has worked well for my kid is the idea of getting to do things. When he was 2 he GOT TO go to daycare, instead of you HAVE TO go to daycare, for example. It\u2019s subtle but it has served us well. He goes into everything with an adventurous spirit and since you get what you expect to get half the time, he is nearly 13 now and genuinely looks forward to seeing his dentist and pediatrician, is proud when he\u2019s brave for shots, makes sure I\u2019m getting pics of his stitches, and loves school. \n\nSo getting to go spend the night with babysitter, or grandparent, will likely set the tone for how well he does on the trials and hopefully make the big trip a supersized treat. \n\nNTA, enjoy the con!", "I've been on Reddit for approximately a year now. I've encountered multiple posts here where my response (in my brain) differed from the replies. In reading the replies, I've learned to see other perspectives. This is a perfect example. \n\nI don't have kids. And my initial response was YTA. But these replies really helped me see that that might not be the case! Good work!", "NTA. When I was little I wanna say 7 years old, my mom, grandma, and brother who was 3 were going to Hershey, our dad was in Puerto Rico for business trip, our sister was 1 years old. We live on Long Island so, PA, is 3-4 hour car ride. My mom and dad decided that it would be best to leave her home alone with my maternal grandma bc she wouldn\u2019t have been able to go on any rides and the car ride would have been too much for her bc of her age. \n\nIt actually wound up being too much for me and my brother bc once we got into PA, our mom got pulled over and this Trooper claimed he was following us for over 3 miles for speeding. That he clocked at 80mph. We were hysterical in the back seat crying that mommy was going to go to jail and our grandma doesn\u2019t drive. Cop was an ass, he saw NYS plates and wanted to make an example out of us. Yes, our mom was doing 80mph with 2 young kids, her MIL and was evading police for 3 miles. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.  It's ok to let your littlest one stay home this time. I'd do some practice runs with the babysitter or grandma.  I stayed with a few different people as a child, my kids did too, it was not a big deal at all.  Maybe make a point of letting the kiddos pick out something fun for him and you could plan to facetime or something - you may want to practice that ahead of time to see if it's upsetting or he likes it.", "NTA.

He will remember seeing his parents and brothers and sisters leaving without him in a car.", "I mean, if you're leaving your kid behind, it's not a \"family\" trip.\n\nYou need to do practice runs, as you mention in your update, because leaving *any* kid that age behind for five days when they have never been away from you for one is not going to go well right out the gate, but a child that has higher needs will take it even harder.\n\nIt might be kinder not to take the youngest with you, all things considered,  but you should also make sure some fun things are scheduled for him as well, not only for \"fairness\", but because he also deserves fun, and because the more fun he is having, the less he will focus on you being gone.\n\nNTA, but prepare well.", "Omg go!!!! And don\u2019t ruin it worrying about him. It\u2019ll be fine! And don\u2019t call a lot as that may make it worse! But please go have fun", "Hmmm, so I will go with NAH or a slight YWBTA.  Everyone in the comments is focused on toddler\u2019s age and the fact that he won\u2019t remember this trip.  While that\u2019s definitely true, something here gives me pause. I think it\u2019s because we are only getting OP\u2019s point of view.  The terrible car trip and not being able to see everything OP wanted because of the toddler\u2019s age.   I wonder, though, what OP\u2019s other kids will say.  For them, maybe having their little bro with them on a family trip far outweighs the inconvenience of the unpleasant car ride.  As a kid, taking a family trip means everyone goes. When they talk about this trip as a family, it won\u2019t be a complete family memory because one kid was left behind while everyone else went, including cousins.  Let\u2019s be honest, all parents have to compromise to some degree on their vacations if they want to bring their kids, but what makes a family trip magical is having the memory of being do something as an entire family.  These are the memories that are cherished because it\u2019s so hard to do when the kids get older and start living their own lives.  Sometimes bad vacation experiences even become funny family stories that are told for years to come.    Honestly, unpleasant car rides are probably a lot more traumatic for the parents, especially the driving parent, than the other siblings who can just wear headsets and distract themselves.  Lastly, with that many potentially babysitters on the trip, I\u2019m not sure why the group couldn\u2019t split up from time to time if there was one particular event OP was really interested in seeing.  I guess I\u2019m kinda wondering if leaving the toddler behind is more of OP\u2019s personal preference versus something the whole family wants.  The one thing that does give me pause, though, is safety.  It could be potentially unsafe to drive such long distances with an upset toddler if it can negatively effect the driver\u2019s abilities.\n\nAs Lilo says\u2026Ohana means family, and family means no one gets left behind\u2026.\n\nEdit to add\u2026.of course, couple trips are also important, so OP could consider making this a couples trip?", "NTA. I have 4 boys (19, 16, 10, 9). When my oldest 2 were young I took my then 6yo to NYC and left the 3yo at home with family because I knew all the walking would be just too much and I would have to carry him everywhere and it was a great trip and he had fun with our family on his own. With my youngest 2, my 10 yo just went on a trip with his friend so I took my 9 yo on his own trip with just us and my mom and we had a great time. It's ok to do things apart and he is so young that he won't remember anyway. I hope you have a great trip no matter what you decide!", "YTA already, it is ur kid, make some core memories. And if the toddler is being outrageous at a car ride, work on that first. You may need to take more drives with him.", "YTA", "Yep, exactly. If you really feel bad about it, bring him to a playground or something after you guys get back. It will be equally as exciting for a kid that little and none of you (including him) will have to deal with the unpleasantness of the long car ride. NTA", "This is great advice. I agree.", "Way to stay in character Jenkins", "I would definitely arrange for some sleepovers first to get him used to it.", "Yeah, a three year old isn't yet capable of feeling left out in that sense. I'd leave him with the grandparents/babysitter. He'll most likely have a great time.", "This is so sweet \ud83e\udd7a", "This would be so much better for everyone."]}
