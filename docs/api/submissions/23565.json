Slightly TA to your roommate in this situation as they could end up with someone terrible. YTA to the landlord in this situation as you signed as lease to pay that amount for the full term. Some leases have amendments that allow you to provide 2 months notice and break the lease, but again, depends on laws where you live and what you signed.
