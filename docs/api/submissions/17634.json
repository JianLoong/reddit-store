You don't have to do anything. If they can't stand having your mustache in their photos, they can release you from serving in the wedding party. It's always ridiculous when the bride and groom expect another person to alter his/her appearance for their wedding.", "I'm going with NAH.\n\nIt's your body, so you get to decide what happens with it. They don't get to dictate anything but a dress code.\n\nHowever, I think it's reasonable to be cautious with photos around major life events. Passing styles in your life will be made concrete in photos, and wedding photos are the most frequently revisited. If you have any doubt about the longevity of the mustache, shave it.\n\nIt's justifiable that your brother and SIL would want pictures of you at their wedding that no one will regret years later, including you. You never really know if a new style is going to work out in the long run. And they want to be able to revisit those photos without anyone bemoaning a pretty noticeable physical change, like facial hair.\n\nBUT, if you're confident you won't regret the stache, then stand your ground. Your confidence in it will be the only thing that convinces them to drop it.", "INFO, did you have the moustache when he first asked you to be the best man?

In fact, I think you ought to lean into the whole moustache thing and buy a fake moustache (if you don't mind glueing it  over your own).  Nothing too outrageous, but I do like the aesthetic of [this one](https://assets.heart.co.uk/2014/44/movember-2014-by-greg-anderson-world-beard-and-mustache-competition-in-portland-43-1415032625-view-0.jpg), which is elegant without being gaudy.  Wear it every time you see the couple between now and the wedding.  Then remove it for the wedding itself, and they will be so delighted that they won't object to your own moustache being on show.  \n\nGenius, no?", "NTA and if your appearance bothers them so much just decline to be in the wedding.", "A manly man's beard", "And the bridesmaids dyed their hair?  Should have told the bride \"no way in hell\"   lol", "It\u2019s insane,  I swear they all think they\u2019re influencers and their 185 followers need to see their perfect wedding.", "Thanks for the explanation and good points on the moustache being  cemented I\u2019m the photos. All my engagement photos are with it and mine and my fianc\u00e9s favourite photos of me are with my moustache. Not sure I\u2019ll keep it for forever of course but for right now this is my style for my young adult years and it works well. Thanks!", "Unless you are clairvoyant, none of this is right. It\u2019s wrong even if you *are* clairvoyant. Cf., basically every wedding fashion choice from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s.", "I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t have the moustache when he first asked me. I tried growing it the summer before but it wouldn\u2019t fill out then I tried again the next year and have had it ever since so it never came up when he asked me to be his best man.", "They did. I couldn't believe it. I told the bridesmaids they were nuts for giving into her demands", "It really is insane, I can't believe people these days are more interested in photos and what the wedding looks like cost, etc, rather than just being happy that they are marrying their spous.", "Since you didn't have a moustache when he asked you, I think they can ask you now to shave it but you have every right to say no. They should either accept it or tell you that unfortunately if you don't want to shave it, your brother will ask someone else to be his best man and you will have no right to be offended. They have the right to want a wedding of their dreams and you have the right to your moustache. If you cannot compromise just let it go.", "It makes no difference when he grew his moustache. It's his face, and he can do what he wants with it. Him having a moustache is not going to atop them having g the wedding  of their dreams, and if it is, then that's really sad.", "Do you think that, as little children, adolescents, young adults fantasizing about the wedding of their dreams, that top of the list was, No moustache on the best man?", "If they think that OP's moustache is ridiculous I can understand that they don't want to see it on literally every picture of the ceremony...", "No I don't. But I believe that they want beautiful photos of it to preserve and probably OP's moustache is far nor as good as he thinks it is. Didn't you ever have a friend who had something ridiculous about his/her appearance? Something that even she/he is embarrassed for now? I have... And I have seen some really bad moustaches before...", "Cool. Still not their choice. You don\u2019t get to choose a convenient family for photos. You choose the people you love, warts and all.", "I have had that friend, yes. We all have. And honestly, looking back, that friend makes the photos significantly more awesome.", "Agree it's not their choice! I also said they can't tell OP to shave it. I just said that it's understandable if the groom want's another best man in that case. One of my closest friends is a really beautiful girl. If I didn't have a sister it's possible I would ask her to be my maid of honor. But if after I asked her to be my maid of honor she changed her appearance (e.g. cutting of her beautiful long honey colour hair to a half up neon pink tusk punk hair) to something I wouldn't like to have on my wedding photos I think it would be up to me to ask someone else for that position. I can love someone even if I don't like their style. More precisely: it's not their current style for which I love my friends and family. This moustache doesn't seem something even close to the extreme hair thing I mentioned before and still I think the couple have the right to make such decisions. We haven't seen the moustache. Probably it's really not that good as OP thinks.", "I can totally accept that this is your opinion. However it doesn't have to be everybody's opinion. A wedding is once in a lifetime thing (if the couple is lucky) and it's about them. Let them be a little bit crazy about it.", "Not at the expense of anyone else\u2019s bodily autonomy.", "I am sorry but I won't write it down more times that I also think they have no right to demand OP to shave his moustache...", "Sorry, was it someone else above who wrote: \u201cI think they can ask you now to shave it\u201d?", "NTA I don't get why they think, that they have the right to dictate your appearance.", "They'll see about that? I can't believe they think they can get away with such malicious bullying.\n\nNTA. Stand your ground--and do you really care whether you go to this wedding or not? I wouldn't attend after the couple treated me with such confident abuse.\n\nYou'll save a lot of money and trouble, plus you'll make it clear to your brother that he cannot push you around.", "NTA.  Seriously?  They are completely out of line.  It is obsessively controlling.  It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they try to get you drunk at the bachelor party so they can shave it for you.", "Lol post pic of your \"presentable mustache\"", "NTA \n\nYou already said you'd trim it up and make yourself clean and presentable for the occasion. That should be the end of it.", "NTA but clear this now: they accept you as you are or you step down /don't go to the wedding to not ruin their ' wedding look' ( record it) otherwise you'll have the whole family pressuring you if the wedding is imminent.", "I don\u2019t particularly like mustaches on anyone. My brother specifically grew a thick mustache for my wedding because he thought it would piss me off. I  laughed and told him he looked ridiculous when I first saw him that weekend but didn\u2019t say another word about it. I think he expected me to throw a fit and demand he shave it, but I didn\u2019t particularly care. I wasn\u2019t planning to spend much time staring at my brother that weekend. (My husband did ask if he can have a mustache for the wedding too and I said no, but that\u2019s just because he looks so damn good with his beard). Now the whole family laughs together at the pictures because my brother does look ridiculous with his mustache- it\u2019s just not his normal look and he doesn\u2019t really pull it off. \n\nNTA- if they weren\u2019t demanding you shave, I\u2019d say N A H. They can ask once, but persistently demanding you change your appearance for their wedding is asshole behavior. As long as your facial hair looks clean and neat, there\u2019s no reason to alter it just because two people are getting married.", "What a strange request. Ask your brother to get a Mohawk or shave his head for the wedding and you will be happy to shave.
