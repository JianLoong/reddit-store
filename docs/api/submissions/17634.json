You don't have to do anything. If they can't stand having your mustache in their photos, they can release you from serving in the wedding party. It's always ridiculous when the bride and groom expect another person to alter his/her appearance for their wedding.", "I'm going with NAH.\n\nIt's your body, so you get to decide what happens with it. They don't get to dictate anything but a dress code.\n\nHowever, I think it's reasonable to be cautious with photos around major life events. Passing styles in your life will be made concrete in photos, and wedding photos are the most frequently revisited. If you have any doubt about the longevity of the mustache, shave it.\n\nIt's justifiable that your brother and SIL would want pictures of you at their wedding that no one will regret years later, including you. You never really know if a new style is going to work out in the long run. And they want to be able to revisit those photos without anyone bemoaning a pretty noticeable physical change, like facial hair.\n\nBUT, if you're confident you won't regret the stache, then stand your ground.

In fact, I think you ought to lean into the whole moustache thing and buy a fake moustache (if you don't mind glueing it  over your own).

They should either accept it or tell you that unfortunately if you don't want to shave it, your brother will ask someone else to be his best man and you will have no right to be offended. They have the right to want a wedding of their dreams and you have the right to your moustache. If you cannot compromise just let it go.", "It makes no difference when he grew his moustache. It's his face, and he can do what he wants with it. Him having a moustache is not going to atop them having g the wedding  of their dreams, and if it is, then that's really sad.", "Do you think that, as little children, adolescents, young adults fantasizing about the wedding of their dreams, that top of the list was, No moustache on the best man?", "If they think that OP's moustache is ridiculous I can understand that they don't want to see it on literally every picture of the ceremony...", "No I don't. But I believe that they want beautiful photos of it to preserve and probably OP's moustache is far nor as good as he thinks it is. Didn't you ever have a friend who had something ridiculous about his/her appearance? Something that even she/he is embarrassed for now? I have... And I have seen some really bad moustaches before...", "Cool. Still not their choice. You don\u2019t get to choose a convenient family for photos. You choose the people you love, warts and all.", "I have had that friend, yes. We all have. And honestly, looking back, that friend makes the photos significantly more awesome.", "Agree it's not their choice! I also said they can't tell OP to shave it. I just said that it's understandable if the groom want's another best man in that case. One of my closest friends is a really beautiful girl. If I didn't have a sister it's possible I would ask her to be my maid of honor. But if after I asked her to be my maid of honor she changed her appearance (e.g. cutting of her beautiful long honey colour hair to a half up neon pink tusk punk hair) to something I wouldn't like to have on my wedding photos I think it would be up to me to ask someone else for that position. I can love someone even if I don't like their style. More precisely: it's not their current style for which I love my friends and family. This moustache doesn't seem something even close to the extreme hair thing I mentioned before and still I think the couple have the right to make such decisions. We haven't seen the moustache. Probably it's really not that good as OP thinks.", "I can totally accept that this is your opinion. However it doesn't have to be everybody's opinion.

Seriously?  They are completely out of line.  It is obsessively controlling.  It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they try to get you drunk at the bachelor party so they can shave it for you.", "Lol post pic of your \"presentable mustache\"", "NTA \n\nYou already said you'd trim it up and make yourself clean and presentable for the occasion. That should be the end of it.", "NTA but clear this now: they accept you as you are or you step down /don't go to the wedding to not ruin their ' wedding look' ( record it) otherwise you'll have the whole family pressuring you if the wedding is imminent.", "I don\u2019t particularly like mustaches on anyone. My brother specifically grew a thick mustache for my wedding because he thought it would piss me off. I  laughed and told him he looked ridiculous when I first saw him that weekend but didn\u2019t say another word about it. I think he expected me to throw a fit and demand he shave it, but I didn\u2019t particularly care. I wasn\u2019t planning to spend much time staring at my brother that weekend. (My husband did ask if he can have a mustache for the wedding too and I said no, but that\u2019s just because he looks so damn good with his beard). Now the whole family laughs together at the pictures because my brother does look ridiculous with his mustache- it\u2019s just not his normal look and he doesn\u2019t really pull it off. \n\nNTA- if they weren\u2019t demanding you shave, I\u2019d say N A H. They can ask once, but persistently demanding you change your appearance for their wedding is asshole behavior. As long as your facial hair looks clean and neat, there\u2019s no reason to alter it just because two people are getting married.", "What a strange request.

Hell, I'll even admit that it caused a little bit of resentment on my part towards my brother's wife as it was at her request that I cut off my hair. Her day of happiness has resulted in months of low self-esteem for me, and that won't really resolve until my hair is back at a length I'm happy with.", "My sister tried to pull this with me for her daughter's baptism where I was the godfather.  I am bearded.  Sister and I are 180 degree polar opposites.  Im a work with my hands, outdoors, get dirty type and she is a park ave, miss new york, closet full of hundreds of shoes type.  She thought the beard didnt \"fit\" with her crowd, her guests and she hates facial hair.  \"I dont want to look at the photos and remember my brother looking homeless\"\n\nI told her I will not be shaving my beard and if thats a show stopper, then find a new godfather for her daughter.  I warned my sister that this is the last time Ill entertain this kind of talk and criticism.  Know from this point fwd that me and the beard are an inseparable package deal.  You criticize me one more time and you wont have to ask because Ill withdraw myself not only from being godfather but I wont even attend the baptism.  Ball is in your court, dont put me to the test bc finding a new godfather 2-3 weeks before the baptism is going to be impossible for you.\n\nI dont like to fight with my sister and give ultimatums like this but the henpecking and constant badgering about my beard just became too much.  What are your brother and SiL going to do to you?  Hold you down and forceably  shave you?  Anyway, NTA", "NTA. I don't think they should insist but you might do it out of kindness if it bothers them that much. Consider also, that it might grow back in less patchy if you start from scratch after the wedding. \n\nYou could consider it your wedding gift to them. \n\nAnyway, your choice.", "NTA and do not shave it unless you want to.

Like if it\u2019s a dope stash they are way out of line but if that shit weak and looks bad I can see why they would ask.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's not their place to even suggest such a thing.", "NTA.

Offer to step down if this is so important to them\n\n2. Let them know that forcibly removing someone's facial hair is considered assault.  In some jurisdictions, it's considered battery and assault.\n\nBecause they won't let it go, I would just remove myself from the position as it seems your lack of mustache is more important than you with mustache standing by him on his wedding day.\n\nI wonder what other things your family has pulled through the years.", "NTA as about 'my body my choice\" why does your brother want it shaved off? has he given a reason? lets be honest, does it look good? It's still your call but their expectation seems...odd", "If they'd be comfortable letting you dictate which hairs on their head can remain for your wedding.", "Imagine the embarassment on his brother and Sil that if they did shave him, he just wouldnt attend.  The brother would look like an asshole at the altar with nobody to stand next to him.\n\nIf this did happen to OP, Id make sure to spread the truth like wildfire to all who would listen so it becomes juicy gossip the newlyweds will hear murmuring through throughout the wedding party.", "Lol luckily I had mine before the new top gun movie but I\u2019ve definitely gotten the maverick comments before! I don\u2019t mind", "They just don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper and it doesn\u2019t fit with what they want. I think I can say the moustache is nice though, I get complimented all the time on it especially when I first grew it out well and even now when I meet new people or see friends for the first time I\u2019m a while.

I feel so sorry for people that think they have to have a picture perfect, Instagram ready wedding. Like it will reflect badly on them if it doesn\u2019t look amazing on social media. \n\nAnd this picture perfect ideal is more important than sharing your happiness with friends and family. And more important than being a good host and making your guests feel comfortable & included in the celebration. It\u2019s really sad. \n\nI got married over 20 years ago and the look of the whole day coordinated, decor, flowers, bridesmaid dresses, etc. But no crazy obsession with every little detail. My bridesmaids were scattered across the county and their were no video calls back then so I had no idea what sort of haircut or color they were going to have. I paid for hair on the day but left it up to them on the style they wanted. \n\nMaybe I would have felt differently if my early 20s were captured on social media? I\u2019m happy to never know!"]}
