I'm not saying that's you, but be aware that may be part of the issue. \n\nIt will grow back, it's a nice thing to do for you brother, I would suggest shaving it. Sure it may take a bit but he's not getting married every 6 months. It's a pointless thing to cause an issue over around a wedding. I shaved for my buddies wedding, he couldn't grow a full beard so I cut down to a handlebar to match him. I looked like a goober for 3 weeks, but it was for my MF boy so it wasn't a huge deal.
