She spends every moment not working with them, calls them throughout the day, and takes a month off between jobs to take care of her family. Seb\u2019s blown me off so many times to be with Sana when she has an early night. I\u2019m kind of jealous. \n\nI asked how he got Sana to cut back since she also loves her career. Seb admitted he does an act to her to \u201cpunish\u201d her for staying late. I was horrified. Seb started laughing and said Sana agreed to it and they prepped and it was fine. I can\u2019t see him in the same light anymore. I took my son home. \n\nI avoided Seb\u2019s texts, missed a playdate with my son, and when we ran into each other he asked me why I was acting weird.

This is not about a kink. He told you that this was his way to manipulate her to do as he wishes. And even if it wasn't such a weird thing, manipulating someone instead of setting up rules and boundaries together is just not the way. And that is not the kind of person I would want as a friend, and that is not the environment I would like for my kid.

We don\u2019t allow people to consent to certain things in a developed society. We recognize that people can\u2019t consent to selling organs because we know it would exploit the poor. The UK recently had an entire campaign around whether or not people can consent to their own murders through the \u201crough sex defense,\u201d spoiler, they can\u2019t. If someone consents to something, it does not absolve you from facing the morality, or lack of, of your actions. The organ seller and the organ buyer may both \u201cconsent\u201d but we recognize that the buyer is still engaging in an immoral activity. \n\nSeb and his wife can engage in these activities, but OP can take moral issue with them. There is nothing wrong with that. I have friends of different belief systems, political perspectives, backgrounds, etc, but there are some things that would be incompatible with my personal morals and I probably wouldn\u2019t hang out with that person. OP is allowed to make that same decision. Seb is allowed to be hurt as well.

It sounds like telling you was an error in judgement on his part, but why should your son lose his best friend over it? He didn't ask to spank you.", "YTA.  Sebs wife has consented.  This is a kink thing.  Stop shaming.  Clearly they have placed trust in you erroneously.", "YTA and need to grow up. Seb and his wife are both consenting adults. You asked and he answered. Maybe he overshared but you wanted to know how he managed it so that's on you as well. You were a child in ghosting him. And you're harming your child in the process. Be a grown up already and get over it. Yall just avoid talking about those things from now on.", "YTA Sebs only mistake was over estimating how close you two were as friends. It sounds like you're either uncomfortable with your own sexuality or from what you said, projecting some intimacy issues you and your partner are having onto Seb. \n\nAlso the way you handled it was inappropriate, you're both adults don't ignore his texts and blow off play dates, that's most likely why everyone's giving you the cold shoulder. Parents are busy, as you know, they don't have time for people who are going to flake or people who can't be bothered to text back. \n\nMake an appointment with a therapist  and talk these things through, try and figure out why what someone else does in the bedroom is affecting you in such a way, maybe talk to your wife, see if she can cut back at the office so you can work on this together. Whatever is going on has already affected your child once and cost you and him a friend, best to nip it in the bud before it becomes a bigger issue down the line.", "YTA\n\nIf my kid has a friend and I don't like the kids parents....who cares?
