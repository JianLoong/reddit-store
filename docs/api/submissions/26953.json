Not doing so is rude. Okay, so he didn\u2019t feel like he had anything in common with those at dinner, that\u2019s fine, but that\u2019s no reason to be blatantly rude, refuse to speak so everyone can understand you & watch tv on your phone. That\u2019s what makes him TA. Had you been upset for the way he speaks at home, that would be a different story. As it is, he just sounds like a terrible jerk.", "NTA. Purposely speaking a language the people around you don\u2019t understand, when you DO speak the language they speak, is rude, no matter what languages are involved.", "NTA\u2026.it\u2019s absolutely rude to speak in a different language when you\u2019re out with others and they can\u2019t understand you. It\u2019s one thing if he didn\u2019t know English, but he does. Also, language aside, his behavior was just rude in general. Someone needs to teach him some manners.", "NTA from his response it sounds like he was being deliberately rude as he didn't like your friends.", "NTA. I used to work for a company based out of India. I was the only american working in the office (in America). We would occasionally have work dinners and they would all speak in their native language. I felt so left out. They all spoke perfect English. I hated going to dinner with them.", "NTA Your roommate was being rude. Even if he was speaking English the entire time his behavior was antisocial and rude.", "He actually. Used. The. Speaker!\n\nHow is that no rude? NTA, that friend of yours should take a good long look in the mirror, see who that rude guy is, staring back at him.", "NTA but I'd focus less on the language and more on how fucking rude it is to sit out at a place ignoring the people he's there with.", "NTA he was being rude.  He wants to get out there but ignores people that\u2019s not how it works.  You can be proud of your heritage and not be a jerk.", "Esh.    \n\nYou also didn't have to speak to him on Spanish.

While they may not be fluent, there are an awful lot of people who took Spanish as a language or lived in areas with large latinx populations.\n\nIf he speaks to you in Spanish again, answer in English. If he pushes, encourage him to leave. Just because you're roommates, you aren't joined at the hips and if he's not enjoying himself, he can go play with his phone in private.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He's on his own for meeting people and seems very superficial", "NTA. Your friend was terribly rude and his behaviour was appalling.", "NTA, but Spanish isn't the issue here. It's no different from him spending the whole evening whispering in your ear instead of talking loud enough for everyone to hear. As a fellow reserved person, I can understand being more comfortable talking to people you know than people you don't, but that doesn't mean I make a point of excluding people I don't know from my conversations. That's definitely rude.\n\nIf he wants to go out with you again, make it clear that he has to do the bare minimum of speaking a language everyone understands and keeping his phone in his pocket. He doesn't have to be the life of the party or get along with everyone, but he can't be an embarrassment.", "And this is the guy who wants to get out and meet new people?", "This ^^", "I would say that it's rude when you're ostensibly meant to be socialising with people and deliberately excluding them by using a language they don't speak, but not necessarily in public spaces around random other people.
