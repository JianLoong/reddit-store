There's a social contract that allows for strangers to give children candy on one night and one night only (excluding specifically designated events such as Trunk-or-Treating). Teaching those children that they are allowed to game the system and bully other people into giving them more of whatever they want is a disservice to them and to the community.

Yeah parenting with him might not be a good idea.", "Nah, he just thought it was cheeky kid behaviour.
