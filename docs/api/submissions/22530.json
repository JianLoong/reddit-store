I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw it, I had never heard of it being done like that - I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a newer technique or if it just depends on the vet.

One of the few times it happened, I remember thinking his sheath was an ear until I realized it didn't feel right about the same time my fiance commented on it because I hadn't really woken up yet.

He also loves to roll on his back and have a tummy rub which includes all the furry parts including his inner thighs and the masses of fur between his ass hole and penis. \nThere is nothing molest-y or sexual about this. He wants a good scratch and will wiggle one way or another to show where he wants scratches. \nIf your friend is being a pervert or abusive, report him. If not, grow up. \n\nYou should desensitize your animals to being touched everywhere. They get cancer too and torsions and all kinds of injuries and being able to be an adult about this shit is important. \n\nFYI:  if this bothers you, never get involved with horse people. We actually clean our horse\u2019s penis and check testicles\u2026 which means that when I groom, I touch all parts so they aren\u2019t jumpy if the day ever comes when that part may be injured and I need to doctor it without them thinking WTF, why is she touching me there and it becoming an issue.", "There is nothing wrong with your friend. If your neutered dog is snuggeling next to you, thats just the place your hand lands sometimes when you put your arm around the dog. \n\nAs long you are not sexualising the dog, thats not weird at all. \n\nWe had ppl telling us its gross we also pet our cats stump she has from a bad leg amputation before we adopted her. But we love our cat and her stump is not gross to us.", "NTA,  your friend is being a creep and does sexual stuff on his dog...", "NAH, yeah it's a bit weird that your friend does this with his dog but it's his prerogative. It's also your right to not want to touch the dog there but who are you to say what he does with his pet, as long as the dog isn't injured by your friend being a weirdo then honestly, leave him to it.", "Gotta dig your fingers up there and check for a bean----", "He probably does that, too...", "I think they usually leave the skin so the wound is smaller than a gash where the whole sack was removed. Also less likely to tear because it's got extra skin in the area. It shrinks over time because it's not stretched out anymore. Our rescue came to us the day after desexing, he had a sack still and now a few years later it's hardly noticeable."]}
