Unsurprisingly, everyone else interested were girls. He's strongly considering it, but I'm not keen and told him so. \n\nWhere we are, boys/men who work in roles like childcare or teaching younger kids are heavily looked down upon. Many people (jokingly or otherwise) accuse them of having... certain interests in the children and in some cases parents make unfair complaints because they \"don't trust\" a man in care of their kids. \n\nRyan has been picked on in school before. He's never been one of the tough/macho types and is a bit of cryer, and also likes to paint his nails occasionally, which the \"popular\" kids don't approve of. He can defend himself with the martial arts stuff but I'm worried that if he says he wants to go into childcare, they'll accuse him of being into weird stuff or spread rumours about him.  \n\nAlso, childcare jobs don't pay very well. It's barely above minimum wage, and even a manager doesn't earn much. I want him to have a good life and future, and I don't think childcare will do that for him. \n\nHis dad and I always said we didn't want Ryan being raised to \"be a man\" and that we'd let him be whatever kind of person he wanted.

At 16, your son is starting to make more independent decisions, including those that you don\u2019t approve of. This is something he shows passion and aptitude for, and you are reinforcing the gender norms his bullies have been in not supporting him in this. Do you want to be a bully too? \n\nOnce he is out of school, he can choose not to associate with those people. And your unfounded fear that he will be accused of being into children for nefarious reasons also is fearmongering. Should he never engage with children again for fear people with think something? I think you really need to explore why you feel the need to protect him in ways that reinforce negative stereotypes, and realize that he will shortly be an adult. \n\nThere are MANY careers in childcare aside from (sadly!) lower paying daycare positions. Child speech pathologist, physical therapist, child psychologist, etc. Education is the first step in learning about options. Your discomfort does not triumph his autonomy.", "YTA - Perpetuating sexism and uncaring of what makes your son actually in lieu of money.

You owe your son an apology.", "YTA - Hopefully Ryan can be a good role model to the children he works with since he clearly never had a good parental role model himself growing up.", "I love how this caring young man is wisely choosing to not engage with the rhetoric until his parents are willing to have a conversation with him. Meaning they're talking at him and he's being the mature one by setting healthy boundaries. His minimum requirement is to be able to participate in dialogue. He's fully aware of the potential for bullying and how that impacts him and he is demonstrating refusal to be inauthentic because being inauthentic would be a greater cost to him than experiencing bullying in the short term \n\nOP, you should be grateful your son managed to be such a decent young man despite the bullying from his classmates and heteronormative discrimination you and your husband have (perhaps even subversively if not outright directly) pushed upon him. \n\nYTA. Your son's terms are that he be given the opportunity to voice to you, his parents, his views regarding his chosen path in life.

I know you\u2019re worried about your son, but this seems like something he REALLY wants. And if you can let him be happy in life, isn\u2019t that worth more than any money? Also, if he isn\u2019t about being bullied, then this just shows how badly he wants to help children, that he\u2019s willing to be bullied at school for it. I\u2019m sure Ryan is stronger than he looks. I do agree with you having a conversation about it. You can feel free to repeat your worries to him, but make sure to let him know that if this is what he REALLY wants, then you\u2019ll support him.\n\nEdit: Also, childcare workers are a HUGE need around the world right now, so the more people we can get to actually want to work in childcare, the better.", "YTA - it sounds like your son is more mature than his parents.", "YTA - You say you'll let him be whoever he wants to be, but you are not doing that", "YTA. Being worried about your son is fine, but if you truly want him to be himself, you have to let him make this decision for himself. He doesn't need disapproval at school and at home.", "Yep YTA. Your reasons for discouraging him are your fears - he might get picked on and he won't earn much. His reasons for doing it are the best reasons - he loves babies and young kids and he's great with them.\n\nYour job as his parent in this situation is to support him doing what makes him happy. You can tell him what you're worried about, but be ready to back off if he tells you that those things aren't important to him.

I'm a (female) elementary school speech therapist. There are very few men in the field, but they are greatly appreciated in supporting the kids, especially the boys. And being good role models for all the kids learn that taking care of children isn't \"a woman's job\". \n\n\nAlso, he's 16. He can take classes in lots of different things and figure out what's best. Even if he doesn't go into a childcare field, it's useful information to have.", "YTA. Massively.

We need male teachers sooooo bad but things like this are a huge barrier. And you aren't necessarily poorly paid as a teacher. I make 70,000 and there's teachers making six figures, you just have to aim for the right district. And honestly make teachers have it a lot easier, there's instant respect, boys flock to them, parents don't mess with them as much.

I understand your intentions and it is unfortunately true that some sexists see a male teacher/caretaker and automatically think dark thoughts.

If your son wants in this field for the right reasons and thinks he can handle the burnout of it being damned awful at times thwn encourage that strength in him instead of teaching him to bow to societal pressures.  Also, if pay is the worry then it isn't as if there is nothing to grow into.  Don't just work for a kinder-scare, get into a place where there is a chance to go up into administration or specialize.

When I was 16 I made BANK babysitting. Day cares from what iv seen and worked in don\u2019t allow male  staff and if they do the rules for the men are  soooo strict that it\u2019s not even worth it.. now he could work special education they always have a need for men cause sometimes they need a man to life the child on the changing table..", "YTA for the gender related bit, but I do get the pay related concerns and my parents were the same.

Open your mind and leave your stereotype at the door.", "YTA, it sounds like your ideas are stuck in the 1980's  \n\n\nMany kids from broken homes have very little with regard to male role models, for that reason males in childcare should be encouraged.  \n\n\nWhen I was a child I would have been grateful for more men around in childcare, we saw no men dealing with under 4's, at primary & junior schools we were taught mostly by women with the only men being in management roles, we didn't really have dealings with male teachers until high school....it is often easier for boys of all ages to speak to a man rather than a woman.  \n\n\nYou sound like the type of person who would be equally unhappy if he said he wanted to be a nurse", "Yeah YTA but I'm pretty sure you already knew that and were hoping for a different answer.

You want him to be who he is, but when he shows that to you, you bring up a lot of his personality traits in a way that reads as shame based in bigotry and fear.\n\nIf you don't let him explore his dreams now, he likely won't share them with you at all in the future. The seed of resentment has been planted and will only grow if you don't let him continue to be himself while in your care.", "Yes, YTA and it's sad that Ryan's own parents share those opinions that 'other people have'. The only way those gross assumptions will change is by having more men involved in childcare. Not by discouraging someone who would do well in it.
