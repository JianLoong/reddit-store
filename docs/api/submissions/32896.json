Honestly, I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t get stopped, because the rule I\u2019ve always heard is that you\u2019re allowed one bag that goes in the luggage rack, and one bag to go in front of you.

FAs make constant announcements during boarding about stowing your carryon under the seat in front of you.  On the few occasions where the pax in front of me tried a stunt like that, I simply pulled out the bag, called the FA, and said, \"Someone left this in my foot space.\"  The FA will sort it out.   I try to avoid confrontations with idiots and anyone who would put their bag under their own seat is an idiot.", "Nope, the space on the floor in front of you, which you can easily access during the flight, is yours.\n\nNTA\n\nAlso, most flights have a limit of two carryons (carryon & computer bag or purse as a rule), but I assume the other bag belonged to his travel companion.", "Why in the world would you apologize?

Never under your own seat.\n\nAlso if you are in a row without a seat in front of you all the bags go in the overhead. This guy was just being rude.\n\n(Reason for 3 bags is I am disabled and have a lot of medical issues and you are actually allowed a free 3rd bag about the size of a personal item to carry your medical supplies in so it doesn't take your entire suitcase and prevent you from bringing clothes etc on the plane.

And in your place, I honestly would have contacted a flight attendant and said there was an unattended bag. Mostly because I would have assumed it had accidentally been left behind from the previous flight, but so there would be a buffer between me and the owner of the bag.", "NTA. Don't feel bad about calling someone on their refusal to follow simple rules, the same rules everyone else is managing to follow.\n\nMy thought process is to be gentle at first and assume an honest mistake, but the minute there's any guff or pushback, it becomes the flight attendant's job.\n\n> 6 foot (tall but not actually really tall)\n\nI'm 6 foot as well, and I feel you so much on this.", "You may be suprised to learn there are many a Luddite who firmly believe the area beneath their seat is their territory.", "Yeah when we traveled a few years ago, my three year old fell asleep waiting to board our last flight, so my husband carried her, his carry on and personal bag, while I carried my carry on, my personal bag, and my daughter\u2019s backpack.

I always take just one carry on and that's it lost my luggage one to many  times. Well sure  as shit by the time I got on all the overheads were full so the flight attendant tells my I have to check my bag.  I say hell no to have my one bag!  Tell some of the other people with 2 or 3 bags to check one of theirs!!  She looked at me and knew I wasn't backing down unless they kicked me off the plane .

He didn't want to lose any room to stretch out his feet. \n\nSo no, you are NTA.  And really, stand up for yourself.  Nothing at all in this entire description required apologizing.", "This! OP should not apologize; they did nothing wrong.", "The fact that he ended up packing it all into two carry-ons makes me think he had two carry-ons to begin with and pulled the one bag out of one of the carry-ons for the flight, for whatever reason. When I fly, I try to make everything I anticipate needing as easily accessible as possible, but only in my own area.", "If he managed to get back down to two carry-on pieces, he may have started with two and decanted a third bag to spread out in-flight.", "If you're really in a petty mood, suggest that the previous passenger may have forgotten it...", "Yep, me as well.  I had the baby in his car seat/carrier as well as his carry-on.  Flight attendant told me to get rid of two of the carry-ons, that babies didn't get carry-ons.  I had to show her the baby's ticket and boarding pass before I got to keep everything... because there was no way I'd lap-carry a baby on a 9-hour flight.\n\nETA: This was a flight that they offered to upgrade my husband to 1st and I said that he'd have to take the baby with him..."]}
