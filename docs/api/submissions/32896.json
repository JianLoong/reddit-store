Thinking he was trying to keep out of the way while unknowingly being directly in the way and him and his wife simply needed to finish getting their bags away and move over into the middle and window seat I told him 'Sorry, I'm in this seat'. The response was a lot of faffing about boarding passes only for them to realise they were in completely the wrong row before disappearing off down the aircraft. So I'm already feeling like I've caused a fuss before I even sat down.\n\nOnce seated I empty pockets into the seat pocket and begin testing out my tiny slice of the universe for the foreseeable future. Cushion, blanket, headrest, earphones all great. Being 6 foot (tall but not actually really tall) I stretch my legs out looking for the comfort limit this seat-on-a-budget will allow.\n\nOnly I find my feet hit something under the seat in front of me a lot sooner than I expected. Turns out the guy in front has placed a leather handbag or satchel under his seat. AITA for thinking the space under the seat in front of me is my space? That's why the flight attendants say \"place your bags above you or under the seat in front of you\" right? I'd never put anything under my seat because I'd expect that is where the passenger behind me would put their feet.\n\nSo I speak up against a fellow passenger for the second time in 5 minutes and ask him if it was his bag and if he could please move it. He looks at me like I'm insane for saying anything. He never says a word but spends the next several minutes re-sorting out his bags as it turns out the satchel in my foot space is his third bag in addition to one under the seat in front of him (oh the irony) and a large one above him. As I'm throwing in more apologies 'Sorry, long legs' etc he combines his belongings into a mere two carryon pieces like a peasant and throws one more glance and a half smile at me the fussy, bossy guy before sitting back down.\n\nAITA here?

That seat, and the foot space, belongs to you.  He was the AH for making a  big deal about having to move his crap.", "NTA. Passengers are supposed to put their carry-on under the seat in front of them, like you said. Don\u2019t mistake his pouting for you doing something wrong.", "NTA. The foot space __in front__ of him is his. He doesn't get to also claim the foot space under his own seat. Every sane person that has ever been on a plane knows this.", "NTA- though personally, I wouldn\u2019t have been as apologetic. I would have asked if thats his bag, and if he didn\u2019t respond, I\u2019d stand up and loudly ask everyone nearby if it was their bag. Until he\u2019s embarrassed enough he moves it. Or if he doesn\u2019t, let the flight attendant know theres an unattended bag under the seat in front of you where your carry on should go. Thats YOUR space, not his.", "NTA.  I had this happen to me once and I just took it out and put it in the aisle and let the flight attendant know.  It ended up getting put up in a bin in the back of the plane so she ended up being the last one off.  Best karma ever!", "NTA. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t get stopped, because the rule I\u2019ve always heard is that you\u2019re allowed one bag that goes in the luggage rack, and one bag to go in front of you. That\u2019s it. The space in front of you is yours, that\u2019s it.", "NTA\n\nAnd you don't need to apologize, the space under the seat in front of you is your space, as you said, we are being asked to out our bags under the seat in front of us.", "NTA - lol, he was scamming you, he came in with way too much personal baggage, nice try buddy, huh?", "NTA, that is literally the rules of the plane. He knows this and tried to pull one by you. It\u2019s crazy to me that there are adults to act like this when plane behavior and plane rules are pretty standard stuff.", "NTA, but, had you asked a flight attendant\u2026..they would\u2019ve probably made him check the bag.

FAs make constant announcements during boarding about stowing your carryon under the seat in front of you.  On the few occasions where the pax in front of me tried a stunt like that, I simply pulled out the bag, called the FA, and said, \"Someone left this in my foot space.\"  The FA will sort it out.
