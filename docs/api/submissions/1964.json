If it is a stand-alone store and he is a manager, contact the owner (you should be able to find out online who the owner is). Even if he is the owner of the store, you can absolutely threaten him that you are going to go to your state's Labour Board and report him for sexual/religious harassment, and that if he doesn't want a lawsuit, he should stop making inappropriate comments to you, because you are keeping track of them. \n\nI'm so sorry you're dealing with this.
