{"id": 31619, "submission_id": "182p9nv", "title": "AITA for wanting my fiance to cut off his ex fling cause she keeps disrespecting me ?", "selftext": "I (26F) got recently engaged to my fiance (26M). He has a relatively large friends group and one of his ex flings (25F) is part of it. He told me that they only had a casual relationship which they've ended amicably and that he's not close to her anymore but she can't her off completely cause she's part of the same friend group as him. I wasn't perfectly comfortable with him being still friends with a person he was sleeping with, but I didn't want to act possessively toxic and forbid him from interacting with her, so she obviously remained part of the group. However it really seems like almost every time I see her she throws a jab towards me, like the first time I've met she said that I don't need to feel threatened by her cause she has no romantic interest in my boyfriend even tho I haven't said anything to her about their history, but I just shrugged it off as her trying to clear the awkwardness.\n\nBut since then she made comments about my clothing (saying that I don't need to dress that extra all the time), about my and my fiance's wish to not have children (saying that she wishes he'd found a girl to change him out of this mindset) and even said that she believes that not liking dogs is a red flag when I mentioned casually that I'm not a dog person. I called her out on some of this stuff sometimes, but she'd always say something the lines of: \"I didn't mean it like that\". I was starting to get tired of her little comments, but my fiance told me that she's just a bit awkward and sometimes comes across as rude, but that she doesn't mean any harm.\n\nHowever she really crossed the line when after I showed my future bridesmaids the wedding dress I was planning to buy, she messaged saying that she found out what wedding dress I was vying for (I have no idea how she found out exactly) and said that she thinks it's a bit too bland and that she thinks my fiance would prefer if I glammed up for our wedding. I've honestly had enough and told her in message that what she thinks is irrelevant to me and to stay on her lane (adding a few more curses) and afterwards I blocked and I told my fiance that I want him to cut her off from our lives cause I don't want to interact with her ever again.\n\nHowever my fiance said that his ex fling contacted saying that she feels sorry for the way she treated me and that she wants to apologize to me personally, but honestly at this point I'm not interested in hearing any apology from her. My fiance thinks I'm being unfair by not at least hearing her out and that I risk him losing his entire friends group by forcing him to ghost her.

And even if they were, you already called her out, but she kept doing it. \n\nNow she wants to apologise???\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m more curious about how she found out about your wedding dress. If your bridesmaids are the only ones who knew, then there\u2019s a duplicitous bridesmaid in your midst.", ">But since then she made comments about \\[...\\] my and my fiance's wish to not have children (saying that she wishes he'd found a girl to change him out of this mindset).\n\nThat's actually more disrespectful towards your fiance than to yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My fiance thinks I'm being unfair by not at least hearing her out and that I risk him losing his entire friends group by forcing him to ghost her.\n\nAfter all the times he made excuses for her, he wants her to get away with her crap once more? At some point, you'd think that \"enough is enough\", but no, let's keep that cycle of abuse going on. He doesn't need to break up with his friends, he just needs to step up, stop being a coward and calling her out on her bullshit right away. NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS.: Consider that you're about to marry someone who can't even stand up for you.", "NTA! I am sorry but the fact that your fianc\u00e9 is not able to rationally draw a line of respect with a fling is quite hurtful. I hate putting people in situations of \u2018choose me or her\u2019 but I also think healthy boundaries are very important. You can meet the person and listen to the apology but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be friends with someone or have to interact with someone that tries to work you up or makes snide remarks. The fact that she feels a sense of security in telling you what your fianc\u00e9 would like in your dressing and gets away with is baffling to me. It\u2019s not her place to tell. \n\nThat\u2019s what nosey mother in laws are for! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "op, she isnt an ex-fling, she is a friend who he happened to have something with.\n\nshe is being a dick though, pass all her digs at you to your bf and tell him he needs to keep his friend in line. its a partners job to not let others disrespect their partner and your bf is failing.\n\nshe isnt sorry for screwing with you, she is sorry that it didnt work out. her behavior is unacceptable and while your bf doesnt need to cut all contact, he has to change his behavior towards her from \"friend\" to \"person in friendgroup thats disrespecting my fiance\".\n\ndont force him to ghost her, just correct his attitude.\nand your bf can give the other friends a stern talking to regarding accepting her toxic behavior.\n\nNTA", "NTA here. She is being consistently rude to you, and he needs to have your back here. He can give her a single chance before cutting her off. He needs to lay it out clearly to her that you are his fianc\u00e9e, soon to be wife, and that she should treat you with some respect or he won't have anything to do with her anymore.", "NTA, you and your fiance seem to have a plan (wedding, future, etc...) she needs to stay out of it since it doesn't involve here.", "Ask your fiance who is more important,  whose opinion is more important.\n\n  When he hesitates and hums and huhs and makes excuses,  you postpone wedding. He then figures it out or you leave . Simple", "NTA. She sounds like a dick. Making things her business. You\u2019re fianc\u00e9 says she is rude but doesn\u2019t mean any harm. The fact is she is creating harm with her words to you. And he needs to man the eff up and be blunt with this girl so she will stop it.", "NTA\n\nI don't love the demand to cut her off entirely, but his inaction is the cause of it escalating this far. He should have been placing boundaries this entire time, and he certainly shouldn't be acting like her flying monkey trying to get you to forgive her for her awful behaviour. You're not the one excuses should be made to you're the one excuses should be made for. \n\nWhy is it \"forgive her she's awkward\" instead of \"I know you don't see how what you're saying is weird but you need to back off my fiancee because you're making her uncomfortable\"\n\nDo I think he should have to cut her off? Or jeapordize his relationship with those friends? No. But I do think he needs to tell her what woman he prioritizes and what is and is not acceptable behaviour. Trying to help her\"apologize \" to you is not acceptable behaviour.", "My ex had a friend who was rude to me and she dismissed it.

Does she make the same types of jabs with everyone else? If she doesn\u2019t then it\u2019s not an \u201cawkward\u201d thing, it\u2019s petty. \n\nWhichever way you answer that though I do think you and your fianc\u00e9 should sit down and seriously go over both of your concerns. Really listen to each other and work as a team to find a solution that works best for you (for example if you don\u2019t cut ex fling off, your fianc\u00e9 needs to step up and shut down the ex fling\u2019s comments). It seems like both of you have valid opinions and for this to play out well you and your fianc\u00e9 need to be on the same page. All the best OP.", "Oh the friend group. That\u2019s the weirdest thing about the younger folk that baffles me. \u201cSorry. You have to hang out with my ex forever because she\u2019s in my friend group.\u201d Like the people I was friends with when I was 19 I have to be friends with forever.", "NTA - your fianc\u00e9 is being unfair to you after you express discomfort again and again then all he can do is take her side saying you\u2019re being unfair to her for not letting her apologize. He\u2019s a walking red flag with a hard for her still, she got him on the palm of her hands and she knows it. She\u2019s playing the innocent little one while making it look like you\u2019re mean and aggressive.", "Nta - she\u2019s definitely got the wool pulled over many peoples eyes. I hope your fianc\u00e9 uncovers his and sees what your talking about. That woman is one of those toxic women who should carry red flags \ud83d\udea9 around in their backpacks. \n\nShe\u2019s all over the place and honestly borderline stalking you.", "NTA.\n\nYou're uncomfortable with the way she treated you, you've mentioned this to both him and her, and she has not corrected the behaviour. You are not obligated to keep excusing her behaviour to the point of sacrificing your own comfort.\n\nHowever, whether you are the AH or not seems to be the least of your worries. Your fiance is the real AH in all of this. Whether you are in the right or not, it is very telling that he seems to care more about an ex-flings feelings and personal comfort than that of his soon to be wife. This is a big red flag if this is how he plans to treat you in the relationship. \n\nI'm not saying, of course, that you should force him to give up friends, but he does seem to be overly concerned with her for somebody he \"isn't close with anymore\". Same friend group or not. I think this is something you two need to have a talk about more than just \"arranging an apology\" with her because something feels off here and you definitely can't move forward together like this.", "NTA. Ask yourself if you are ready for even more of this when you hitch your wagon to this guy.", "Oof this is a tough one.\n\nOn one hand, I see where your partner is coming from in that those \"jabs\" do seem more awkward attempts at 1) making you comfortable with her being around and 2) banter. I do see if she's not been in this situation before (hanging out with an ex fling's new relationship) how these comments that might be meant to be light hearted teases can come off poorly. She really should have been friendly but given you the space to approach her rather than trying to box you into a form of friendship you weren't going to have off the bat.\n\nBut on the other hand I completely see your side and with it stacking up why you'd be frustrated and want her cut out of your lives. \n\nThe unfortunate reality here is that unless your fiance walks away from this friend group, she's going to be around. It's going to be nigh on impossible to get a consensus with the group to give her the boot, so there might be *some* validity in taking the apology, establishing some firm boundaries and going from there. \n\nNTA.", "Normally I'd say NTA, as keeping exes around in itself is a red-flag.\n\nNot in this case tho. She doesn't really seem like she's trying to hurt you personally, she's just trying to look out for both of you. Especially talking about the wedding dress comment - you overreacted, quite a bit as well. The comment wasn't that bad.\n\nI think you should talk to her, hear her apology, and think about it.\n\nSoft YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He needs to step up and support you in this.", "Duplicitous bridesmaids for sure.\n\nAlso, while nobody wants to feel backed into the corner of having to issue an ultimatum (her or me), how many times can you ask for a boundary, how many times do you have to politely call out the targeted and deliberate actions of someone who is behaving badly toward you?\n\nIf fianc\u00e9 is worried that enforcing a boundary of respect within his friend group would result in him losing his friends, because they would choose her manipulating the group through bad behaviour over his friendship, then they aren\u2019t his friends after all. \n\nAnd if one of those bridesmaids is part of his friend group I suspect we\u2019ve found both suspect and motive.

That BS needs to be shut down yesterday. And chances are the friend is only trying to apologize now because OP\u2019s drawing the line.

Not her wedding, not her fiance, not her relationship, not her business. Unsolicited opinions on information you shouldn't even have aren't appropriate or \"looking out\" for anyone, and not backing off after being asked to back off and trying to use the fiance to get back into contact are beyond the pail.", "She found out what OP picked for a wedding dress, and deliberately brought it up to make an \u201cI know what he likes better than you do\u201d point. That\u2019s not \u201clooking out for them\u201d or well-meant but awkward. That\u2019s territorial, especially coming from a former fling.

The kids comment is proof because she supposedly knows the fiance so well, but expected OP to change his mind? Craziness. She's just trying to start drama, and the fiance is letting her succeed."]}
