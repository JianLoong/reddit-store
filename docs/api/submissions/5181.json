Tell them you no longer will do any days, and if they still try to drop off the children, you will report child abandonment to cps/police. There will be fall out, but based on what you said if you give them a millimeter they will take 1000 miles.

Pack a lunch and go to the public library for the morning. Then go grab a coffee at a coffeeshop. Then go walk around the mall. When you get home, take a long shower, and then cozy up in bed.

Same with my sister whose boys were looking after. What irritates me most about it is I could see if they had to work and had no one to watch them, but my sister in law works for the same company as us and is off for two weeks and my sister is unemployed and isn't looking for a job.", "I'd do that, but the public library in our area doesn't open till noon, there aren't any coffee shops for miles, and our mall is quit literally dead. It wouldn't be that big of a deal but unfortunately I physically can't drive due to an old work place injury. So I'm stuck using the public transit.

The other 10% I keep for bus passes to get me to work since I can't physically drive.", "I'd honestly love too, but it's not financially possible. Neither of us can live alone due to the high cost of living in our state. Not to mention most jobs don't pay a high enough living wage. My job pays below the minimum wage level for our state and only offers at most 22 hours a week. I took this job purely out of desperation because I lack skills that would allow me to work in anything other then a labor job because I worked for 10 years at a job that eventually went under due to covid. No other place would hire me except the public school bus company because of my lack of skills. But they honestly would hire anyone with a pulse right now due to the fact that the company pays us near nothing, isn't legal required to provide insurance of any kind and could care less if their employees are put in any physical danger dealing with violent children.", "I've actually been considering this. I told them how one of the kids on my bus had a strange sounding cough right before break. I could always fake a text from the company and say I was exposed to something. Lol", "We all contribute to the rent and other bills. Since my pay checks are relatively small because my job doesn't pay much I give 90% of my checks to put towards bills. I can't physically drive so I use the other 10% to pay for bus passes so I can get to work.", "Unfortunately I don't have any friends that live in our state. As for living arrangements we all three pay the bills because the cost of living is high in our state. Most jobs, like the one I and my brother have, pay below the minimum wage level for our state. I put 90% of my check towards bills and the other 10% towards buying bus passes to get to work as I can't physically drive due to an old work place injury.", "Unfortunately no. I don't have friends in our state and 90% of my checks goes towards bills. The company I work at pays below the minimum wage level for our state so I don't have enough for anything but a bus pass in order to get to work each week", "We all three pay the rent and other bills because the cost of living in our state is high.", "I've tried that but both my sister in law and my sister say I'm being an AH for not wanting to help.

But that's an idea.", "Go out in the morning  - to a internet  Cafe or library  and come back in the evening.  Nta", "Go crash at their place, call it a child exchange. Their kids are staying with your mom so your mom\u2019s kid gets to stay with them!", "Go out in the morning  - to a internet  Cafe or library  and come back in the evening.  Nta", "Sounds like a good reason to not offer to watch tiny kids that need diaper changes.  \n \nFor the record, I agree in a sense. I did my time with diapers (also in my 50's). But I don't offer to babysit kids that need diaper changes.", "It\u2019s already more work than you should be doing. Opt out and stick to it. Good luck.", "Oh man! They are totally TA. I assume they aren\u2019t paying you! Of course they are calling YOU TA\u2026 because they are gaslighting you and don\u2019t want to put in the work themselves. It sounds like everyone is burnout and dumping the work on you. \n\nThen, get up early and leave everyday. Don\u2019t answer their calls. You will *look* TA.  But if you have any hope of doing your resume and getting ahead on this, then they have forced your hand. \n\nYour mom knows how to take care of kids (she kept all of you alive and well), and your brother playing video games instead of caring for the kids is just plain awful. \n\nThey are all using you. Pack a lunch and water, then leave early for the library, museum, friend\u2019s house during the day, park if you are somewhere tropical. \n\nGood luck job hunting Op! Your family are over stepping by not respecting your boundaries. A few days is fair like you said, but not a whole two weeks. Everyone is getting a vacation but you. Absolutely bad behaviour from your family!", "This exactly, spend tons of time out of the house.", "Yes! They are literally spending the night and staying all day. I asked if they could atleast stay for three or four days then go home, but was told we already promised. I didn't! They did!", "Unfortunately no. The company I currently work for pays below the minimum wage level for our state and I give 90% of what I do get to put towards bills.
