Omg.", "as well\\* is two words. you're helping nobody, you're condescending and ignorant. you are a harmful tutor.", "Yes. There are ways to do this that aren't condescending. Also, being corrected for your nonsense isn't the huge offense you and others imply that it is - it's actually part of normal human interactions.", "I mean the OP quite clearly states that they\u2019re in the UK and they use British vernacular", "I wouldn't use a softer voice, but I would remind them occasionally.", "How about starting with letting the 19 year old complete her conversation with the staffer. I've accidentally forgotten a thank you, to only remember seconds later and I correct my own behavior. \n\nNow if OP later pulled 19 year old aside because they didn't thank the staffer, that's actually proper heads up. And acceptable. \n\nDon't assume that all these comments imply that folks aren't open to correction. What a leap. \n\nWhat OP did, rubs me as quite rude. It's not at all about correcting. If OP normally works with 3 to 6 year olds and this was an implusive thing, then I understand the mistake. \n\nThe typical adult will not modify their behaviors because of how OP spoke to them.  Would you - because it's a legit correction? Or perhaps you would because you got \"shamed\" by another adult and you don't want to repeat that incident?.  While the end result is 5G he same. Only one has true learning.", "Also, to be clear, I appreciate your opinion. \n\nI don't want that to be missed.  \n\nI still disagree simply because how I think OP approached this, cannot be pigeon holed into the realm of acceptable with a grown person.\n\nBut that's the nature of diverse perspectives.", "And that, right there, is why YTA\n\nNEURODIVIRGENT ADULTS ARE NOT CHILDREN, WE ARE ADULTS. SPEAK TO US LIKE THE ADULTS THAT WE ARE!", "again I am not asking whether you would remind them at all. as I said in my other comment, if you wouldn't talk to a neurotypical young adult in this manner you shouldn't be talking to a neurodivergent young adult in this manner. she's an adult with special educational needs, not a toddler.", "As a mom of a neurodivergent almost-adult (17 yr old) dealing with the same kind of teacher, I second that...and so does he!"]}
