I've accidentally forgotten a thank you, to only remember seconds later and I correct my own behavior. \n\nNow if OP later pulled 19 year old aside because they didn't thank the staffer, that's actually proper heads up. And acceptable. \n\nDon't assume that all these comments imply that folks aren't open to correction. What a leap. \n\nWhat OP did, rubs me as quite rude. It's not at all about correcting. If OP normally works with 3 to 6 year olds and this was an implusive thing, then I understand the mistake. \n\nThe typical adult will not modify their behaviors because of how OP spoke to them.  Would you - because it's a legit correction? Or perhaps you would because you got \"shamed\" by another adult and you don't want to repeat that incident?.  While the end result is 5G he same.

You should have apologized for making her feel that way and ended the conversation, not argue like a child yourself.\n\nI feel that girl's frustration in my bones. I'm not diagnosed ND, but I look like a 12 year old at 34, and am often treated as such by strangers. Nothing makes you feel more worthless and small than someone treating you like you are less than them in some way. It makes you feel stupid and insignificant, totally dismissed as the mature individual that you are. It's dehumanizing. Your role as a teacher is to build your students up, not tear them down.

The first is that you spoke to her like that at all. She was completely justified in her response and she was exactly right. Next, you responded to her (very fair) feelings by calling her \"rude\". What in the world? RUDE? Even if you had an issue, which you shouldn't have, \"rude\" is a very odd description. You could have said disrespectful or something but this situation did not involve manners or your perception of them so \"rude\" was a very bizarre and inappropriate choice. Also, you attempted to invalidate her feelings by making a sweeping statement about the way she was communicating and implying that her expression of feelings was somehow unacceptable and was offensive to you. Why do your feelings matter any more than hers? They don't. At all. Finally, you said y'all went \"back and forth\". Really? Over her feelings? Grow up. This should have never happened at all but definitely shouldn't have turned into a \"back and forth\". You had no leg to stand on.

He is on the spectrum, he is an adult, he has agency. They did not like when he advocated for himself. They were surprised when I backed him up.
