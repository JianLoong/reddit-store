The surgeon said my nerve was quite close to the bone and the shattered pieces pierced the nerve in places. I cannot feel my entire bottom lip, my chin, and part of my cheek. It is unlikely that this will improve.\n\nMy husband (M35) has been an absolute gem. He has been looking after everything and making sure that I am eating nutritious food. Due to the nerve damage, I am really struggling to eat normally and end up dribbling most liquid-y food despite that being pretty much all I can eat. Imagine trying to eat soup after getting those numbing injections at the dentist.\n\nMy absolute favourite food in the world is a biscuit and a cup of tea, especially ginger nut biscuits. For those who don't know, ginger nuts are rock hard and are spiced with ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. I have been craving these like you won't believe, but my husband is not a baker. Instead, he asked my mom (F61) to make some for me especially as she knows how I like them.\n\nUnfortunately for me, even dipped in tea, the biscuits are too hard for my jaw. My husband suggested that we steam them. Obviously steamed biscuits do not have an amazing texture, but I felt like I could finally have something nice that wasn't liquid-based. They were also much easier to eat than liquids because I don't need much lip control.\n\nMy mom came over yesterday and saw a steamed pile of biscuits. She initially could not figure out what had happened to them until my husband explained that this was the only way I can eat them. To say she hit the roof is an understatement.\n\nFor reference, my mom was a professional baker and said that her craft has never been so disrespected. She said she will never make another thing for us if this is how we treat her food.\n\nIt didn't even occur to me that this would be wrong, at least I am able to eat the biscuits and appreciate them, but mom texted me saying she will not be making my son's 5th birthday cake, as previously agreed, due to our behaviour. For any bakers (or non bakers with an opinion) out there, was this a baking sin and were we disrespectful?", "created_utc": 1675932928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xq0vd/aita_for_steaming_my_moms_home_baking_and/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you knew she was touchy about her cooking, it would\u2019ve been good to ask if she could make a tender version of the biscuit instead of a crunchy one, but if you didn\u2019t know\u2026well, I\u2019d have been shocked if my mom reacted that way.\n\nDon\u2019t entirely give up on your nerve injury healing at least partially!  I had my wisdom teeth out very late in life (in my 30s), which is much more traumatic, and the nerve for the left side of my lower lip and part of my chin went between the roots of my damn wisdom tooth (the oral surgeon also said I had very deep roots and the smallest adult mouth he\u2019s had to work on, so apparently I just got super lucky).  They originally told me that things should get better in a month\u2026yeah, not so much.  I did see some small improvement at 2 months, though, and continued slow improvements over the next 2.5 years.  It never got to 100% - I have a spot about 1/2\u201dx1\u201d that is usually a little tingly, and the whole area has stayed very sensitive to vibrations and somewhat insensitive to temperature (I have to test hot food/drink on the other side of my lip or I can mildly burn myself before I realize it\u2019s too hot), but it moves as intended and my smile hasn\u2019t had that off center tweak since about 6 months after my nerve injury.

Who (former baker or not) puts pride in their baking over their daughters welfare with the condition you're in? Shameful.", "NTA. Your mum is more concerned about the sanctity of her profession than her daughter's disability.", "NTA. This is insane. Why on earth does it matter how you eat the biscuits?

Hopefully your mum will calm down and realise how rediculous she is being. I take my baking very seriously and steaming biscuits for a medical accomodation is completely different to steaming biscuits because you enjoy commiting crimes against food. On a side note, my suggestion would be to run them through a blender to get a fine crumb. Take the amount you want to eat in a bowl and put in just enough milk to form a soft paste. Give a minute or two for the biscuits crumbs to absorb the milk and go soft.", "NTA \n\nI love cooking for people. I\u2019ve been told I should get into it professionally, but it\u2019s my fun passion hobby and nothing more. And I\u2019d be THRILLED if someone requested I make them something because they wanted it, even if they then had to adjust the format so they could eat it. \n\nWhat a weird, and honesty tragic, reaction of your mother to insinuate that you, her child, who has had a major accident and surgery, have somehow disrespected her for being able to eat\u2026 like\u2026 damn, what a stretch. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP! I hope you continue to heal, and I hope that with time the nerve situation gets better.", "NTA. But your mother might be feeling a very overwhelming lack of control, with her daughter being hurt like this, and this can make people behave really erratically.\n\nIn a fair world, she would apologise to you. In this world, to make things better, you could apologise to her and say that you wanted those biscuits especially, and that the taste reminded you of her and made you feel loved, even when they were steamed. And say that you're obviously not entitled to a birthday cake, but that you would love one and your son has been looking forward to it, or whatever.\n\nIf this all feels wrong and you just want to be mad at her, that's absolutely fair too, or course.", "My mom does know about the accident and all of the injuries which have resulted from it, but she feels I should have asked for something softer which I could eat rather than destroying something I couldn't eat.", "I did specifically want ginger nuts, but I thought they would be okay once they were dipped in tea. Unfortunately I was wrong, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the taste even once they were steamed.", "OP  says ginger nuts are her favourite \n\nNot fair and unkind to imply OP's mother is having a mental breakdown", "OP said that her sensation in her face is unlikely to improve, so it's not super clear how temporary this is. I would *guess* that the inability to eat hard foods is temporary but the numbness isn't, and OP will eat messily until she's gotten used to the numbness and has practice eating despite it, but it's also possible that she might not ever be able to eat those particular biscuits normally ever again, if they're really THAT hard.", "It sounds like it may not be temporary, which feels like it makes this worse.\n\nWithout all the hardship that OP is adjusting to, I could maybe understand someone taking this badly.  Given the situation, very YTA.  Circumstances matter, and this one matters a lot.", "Thank you for your comment, I am very pleased to hear that there might be some light at the end of the tunnel. It has been hard imagining the rest of my life with no control over my lip/chin/cheek. Fingers crossed it improves. Also, congrats on your healing!\n\nIn terms of my mom being touchy, she is very proud of her cooking (especially baking) but this reaction was a total surprise.", "Unfortunately the biscuits would break off in the tea once they were soft enough for me to eat. They would otherwise remain too hard, so the solution was to steam them so I didn't have to dig around in a mug of hot tea.", "We do something similar to this at Christmas. Full mug (or 2) of sherry and using a tongs dip gingernuts (cookies work too but are less Christmassy) in one at a time until they are saturated. Put 5 or 6 biscuits to a layer and top with whipped cream. Repeat for 5 to 6 layers and let sit in the fridge overnight.\n\nAmazing dessert but def to be had in small quantities!", "Thank you for your comment, that sounds fantastic! Unfortunately no alcohol for me at the moment due to all the medications, but I'll add it to my list once I am okay again. I agree with someone else's comment that it sounds very festive for Christmas.", "First of all, I am very sorry for your nerve damage. I have nerve damage as well and some days it's hellish. No one should have to deal with that.  \n\nSecond of all, I wonder if your mom is flipping out for another reason and using that as the \"reason\"? Anything else going on?\n\nThird and last, my sister has to have her drinks turned into gelatin and can only eat food if it is finely chopped, in addition to a restricted diet. It is incredibly taxing/hard work, so I commend your husband for helping you out in this arena. My mother and father prepare my sister's meals, and never with a complaint about how their cooking is being \"modified\". So I don't see why your mom couldn't realize she is being kind of silly.\n\nI know you aren't looking for advice, but maybe write her a letter explaining that you were craving her amazing food, that it's been torture to not have it, and this is the only way. Obviously no offense was meant here.\n\n  \nGood luck to you, sincerely!", "Avoid any person that thinks biscuits are more important than you.", "To be honest they are one of the only biscuits I love.

It might not improve, but the conventional wisdom of nerves not healing or regrowing at all isn't true. I had a brain injury when I was a teenager that caused severe chronic pain and debilitating vertigo/loss of balance, but it's been improving very slowly for the past 12 years, even though it was hard to tell at first!", "What about pouring a little tea in a saucer and letting them take a shallow bath in that?  They\u2019d be easier to scoop up with a spoon that way, too, since there would be less liquid for them to float away in.", "They must be some really hard biscuits!\n\nFrom my experience 3 seconds in a cup of tea is more than enough time to keep the structural integrity of a biscuit\n\nMaybe I'm not thinking through just how difficult keeping the biscuits in your mouth would be once it's mushy.", "There's another version of this made with pineapple juice. You need drained tinned pineapple (crushed or chopped up chunks), double cream whipped up and extra pineapple. Soak the ginger nuts in the juice a bit,  then layer up alternating cream, pineapple and biscuit. The top layer should be cream. It's like a tropical trifle, and the ginger goes really well with pineapple. You could also substitute rum for the juice.", "Wow - a mega version!  My husband used to make my above version, and served it in very small glasses, but without whipped cream.", "Thank you for sharing some advice, it is really helpful. I had not thought about adding gelatin into liquids. \n\nAs to whether something else is going on, I am not really sure. I have been in the hospital for a while and was a little in my own bubble. It might be worth a chat with my mom.\n\nI appreciate your kind words about the nerve damage, I am sorry to hear that you are in the same boat. I hope that you are able to find some reprieve.", "That is actually a good idea, I didn't think of that. Thank you!", "Gingernuts are super solid. We used to crack them on our elbow as kids to break them up.", "Yeah ginger nuts are very hard biscuits.", "That sounds good, too!  Might just have to have a go.", "Sounds like that would make a lovely summer version!", "Try googling \"Thicken up\" it's a powder you add to liquids to help them be a better texture to swallow - from what I can recall you can adjust the quantity used to make 3 levels of texture - syrup, custard and pudding... Its a form of cornstarch but modified to be clear, and flavourless. You can add it to hot drinks, cold drinks, and foods."]}
