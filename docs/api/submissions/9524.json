It is unlikely that this will improve.\n\nMy husband (M35) has been an absolute gem. He has been looking after everything and making sure that I am eating nutritious food.

Instead, he asked my mom (F61) to make some for me especially as she knows how I like them.\n\nUnfortunately for me, even dipped in tea, the biscuits are too hard for my jaw. My husband suggested that we steam them. Obviously steamed biscuits do not have an amazing texture, but I felt like I could finally have something nice that wasn't liquid-based. They were also much easier to eat than liquids because I don't need much lip control.\n\nMy mom came over yesterday and saw a steamed pile of biscuits.

To say she hit the roof is an understatement.\n\nFor reference, my mom was a professional baker and said that her craft has never been so disrespected.

You need drained tinned pineapple (crushed or chopped up chunks), double cream whipped up and extra pineapple. Soak the ginger nuts in the juice a bit,  then layer up alternating cream, pineapple and biscuit. The top layer should be cream. It's like a tropical trifle, and the ginger goes really well with pineapple. You could also substitute rum for the juice.", "Wow - a mega version!

I had not thought about adding gelatin into liquids. \n\nAs to whether something else is going on, I am not really sure. I have been in the hospital for a while and was a little in my own bubble.

Its a form of cornstarch but modified to be clear, and flavourless. You can add it to hot drinks, cold drinks, and foods.", "NTA. I once SLAVED over a beautifully layered lasagna. It was a freaking work of art. Everything from scratch including noodles. My boyfriend at the time scooped it out with a spoon and immediately cut it up to mush. It was so painful to me.

Is she typically like this?", "NTA.  \n\n>the biscuits are too hard for my jaw.\n\nThis got me going for a bit because I was wondering how your mom messed them up so that they'd be hard.  Biscuits are soft and easy to eat.  Then you mentioned ginger nuts in a comment, and it clicked, you were talking about cookies.  I'm an American.  So, to all other Americans reading this OP is talking about cookies, not our version of biscuits.\n\nI'm an amateur baker and I'd be perfectly fine with someone steaming the food I made so they could eat it.  I'd also be more than willing to experiment and find a way to make them softer so that you wouldn't have to steam them (using vegetable shortening rather than butter should make the cookies softer, they don't taste any different.  If you want to try that substitute shortening for butter using a 1:1 ratio).\n\nYour mother should have been happy that you wanted to enjoy her cooking rather than losing her mind over it.", "NTA holy shit.

Not even a little bit.", "If you're unable to eat these biscuits in their original form, doesn't it defeat the purpose of her making them for you in the first place?

Lol tell her to get over it. Would she have been mad if you blended the damn biscuit?

There's several softer cookies that use similar spices, or you could just swap out for the mix you like, that will probably be more edible for your condition.

Wtf does she think happens to her food when it gets eaten??\n\nSomething tells me this is not the first time her profession is more important than your health, feelings, etc.\n\nI'd make the next thing she brings into a smoothie next time, right in front of her. I am petty", "Seriously, your mother is choosing to punish her grandchild for a non-issue. I've worked in bakeries and chocolate shops. I wouldn't care how someone ate my food, as long as they enjoyed it. You have a very legitimate reason for steaming the biscuits. Tell her she's not welcome to celebrate your son's birthday and you'll be getting the cake from Tesco (lol, that will really grind her gears!)", "If your mom calms down see if she could try to make a batch of American style soft baked cookies- she may be into the challenge once she gets off her high horse", "Just want to check - are you being supported by a speech and language therapist? It might seem a bit odd if you aren't struggling to communicate, but SLTs study a broad range of conditions that affect the mouth and throat, and part of their remit includes support patients with eating and swallowing.\n\nAlso, my grandfather had MND which affected his mouth and throat, and there were a few soft but not liquid meals that he was able to eat. I think the main one was cottage pie, as long as the mince was quite small and there were no lumps in the potato he was able to eat without too many problems.", "They also have similar products for toddlers/babies that have swallowing issues. May also be worth looking into that, OP.", "It's disgusting.  My mom had to use that, bc she had ALS.  I felt so sorry for her having to put this stuff in her food & drink bc it was the only way she could nourish herself.  But she hated it.", "I'm tempted to taste that.\n\nBut i know i have a hard time eating certain food, so I'll probably throw up, but now im curious. \ud83d\ude05", "I am a pastry chef and I would never react like your mom did. Knowing what you are going through I would scour my recipes trying to figure out what I could make for you that you could eat, I can think of so many things just off the top of my head. It makes me angry that your MOM, who is supposed to love and care about you, is acting like a spoiled child. Not only is she punishing you (for something you have no control over) but she's also punishing your child.\n\nYou are definitely NTA and I'm sorry you have to deal with this on top of everything you've gone through.", "NTA", "NTA... your mom is terribly self absorbed.  Sorry. Glad you have a helpful husband. Give yourself some space from her negativity", "NTA. What the heck is wrong with your mother?! You wanted something delicious that you\u2019ve missed and had to alter it so you could consume it. Would she rather they sat untouched til they molded because you couldn\u2019t eat them????? \n\nAnd she\u2019s aware of the extent of the damage and the problem you have eating, which makes it worse. Heartless. Utterly heartless. \n\nOP, if it was me I\u2019d have asked what you liked best about them, how firm you can stand, and I\u2019d have tested recipes until I\u2019d made you an alternative food that tasted right but you could eat without pain. Your mother is a monster wtf", "NTA. The best thing about being a baker (I'm fairly amateur, but do sell and bake for events at times) is hearing people say how delicious it is and seeing them reach for another. I can't imagine ever being upset if my kid wanted something I made so badly that they rigged it so they could eat it through a numb jaw. If you enjoyed it, I'd say that's plenty good enough.\n\nAlso, it's super crappy of her to deny your child a cake baked by grandma just because she's mad about some cookies. Why punish your kiddo? That's just petty.", "Your mum is ridiculous", "Your mom sounds like a !!!! You can\u2019t eat it and now you can. NTA", "NTA. One thing to point out about the thickening up powder - my husband had to have this for all liquids after his stroke and according to the nurses and aids at the hospital it is disgusting. Don\u2019t buy a large amount until you try it out lol. You do need to speak with your mom. Tell her how sorry you are that she took your steaming the biscuits as an insult when she should be thinking of it as a compliment. You love the biscuits, have been craving them and am extremely happy she made them for you. You just wanted to be able to eat and enjoy them. Tell her it will never happen again but ask if there is possibly something she can make that will taste like the biscuits but be easier for you to eat. Also let her know if she wasn\u2019t such a great baker you wouldn\u2019t be in this position.", "NTA does she even care that you're dealing with medical issues?", "Um.....NTA.", "NTA, but your mom is. It's not about her", "NTA, is your mother denser than a biscuit?", "NTA\n\nMy jaw keeps dislocating today. I turned homemade mac and cheese into pasta and cheese paste because I can't chew without my jaw sliding out. My mom didn't make a peep because eating matters most.", "I am a home baker.\n\nI have made my entire family's...everything....since I was 12. I sell my items locally and enjoy my hobby.\n\nI want others to enjoy my food. \nI encourage others to slightly spice or enhance in whatever way to make my meal the best, for them. \n\nSteam away!!!\n\nNTA", "I don't know if this helps but if you can go to a doctor or hospital they have something my mum called thick water for stroke patiants to be able to hydrate there's also something which is ball shaped that is used in some nursing homes I'll see if I can find it and add it ti this comment later.\nJust found them and there called jelly drops and there for dementia patients.", "NTA! What the hell though\u2026. Would your mom like you guys wasting her food more?", "Mom is a class A narcissist who absolutely had to go and make it all about herself. Lacking all empathy for OP\u2019s terrible suffering. NTA", "Fuck grandma for that bullshit pulling stunt alone! I bake and if someone had to steam something of mine because it was too hard for them to eat I wouldn't give a shit as long as they could still enjoy it. Grandma needs to get off her high horse.", "We call those ginger snaps where I live and they are awesome. There\u2018s a soft version that a coffee shop near me sells, maybe something similar could be a good option?", "It's disgusting, but hilarious to put in someone's drink as a prank"]}
