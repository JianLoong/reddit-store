He maybe thought that as they were close he might have asked him to be the best man and be included in your wedding. \n\nThe whole not speaking to your husband thing and constantly going through you is very immature and you need to tell him to grow up and stop acting like a child.

You\u2019ve taken his best friend!", "NTA but obviously your brother is hurt by your elopement and being excluded from that. So instead of having a real conversation he's being petty and passive aggressive. \n\nUntil you three have an actual conversation about it, you can expect this behavior to continue.", "So your brother is complaining that your husband finds you so attractive that he can't keep his hands off you?\n\nYour brother is the AH. \n\nIf I was your husband I would tell your brother to butt out.", "YTA because you shouldn't have said anything to your husband at all.

You're provoking him for no reason.\n\nJust be honest about it. If your husband's behaviour doesn't bother you, tell your brother that and tell him it's frankly none of his business when or how your husband touches you, and that you won't be used as a middle-man. You guys are not children anymore and it's your marriage, not his, so either he stays out of it or goes to your husband directly if he's got a problem with him.\n\nIt was also immature of your husband to make a crude joke about you in front of his friends. That's just uncomfortable for everyone involved. So, ESH. None of you handled this right.\n\nIn truth, I think your brother feels disrespected and betrayed/hurt that he was excluded from the wedding. He's probably thinking \"as my close friend he should've at least let me know before running off with my sister and marrying her\". Family can be like that sometimes. I'm not saying he was entitled to an invite or anything, I'm just considering a possible explanation for the weird behaviour.", "YTA. As well as your brother.

You should also tell your brother that you are not a go between and if he want to ask or tell your husband anything. He can do it himself", "NTA.

It's your relationship with your husband.  If you have no issue with it your brother shouldn't either.", "What did the joke have to do with?", "NTA. Your brother sounds like he has some issues with your relationship and he's trying to control you and your husband. He should respect your choices and boundaries, and not make you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed in front of your friends. He also should not expect you to be his messenger and communicate with your husband directly if he has a problem. You did nothing wrong by telling your husband what your brother said, and your brother should not act like it didn't bother him if it did.", "NTA. You're just informing your husband that your brother doesn't like him. But you might want to get to the root of why your brother dislikes him since that isn't likely to go away and its best to see if a remedy or reason can be found before your brother flips a table or something. People not approving of a loved one's partner is unfortunately common but what strikes my interest is that they were FRIENDS before this. Your brother liked and approved of thus guy before and suddenly he didn't? It's worth a talk to see of you can find out what changed. Also, not to hate on you, if you want to elope and not deal with a wedding then good for you, but I get the feeling that you didn't realize that eloping can also seen as a rude 'screw you I don't want you at my wedding' to family.

I admit, sometimes what seems like friendship between men is just respect, without deeper friendship behind it. That makes as men a little careful sometimes, as we wouldn't know of one would react if someone just straight up stood up against sister's BF and vice versa.
