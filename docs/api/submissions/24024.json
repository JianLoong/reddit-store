The simpler explanation is that he felt betrayed because not only did his sister elope, making him feel left out, but he also felt left out by his best friend. It was a double wammy and while childish, it's not an uncommon reaction to a best friend and sibling dating let alone eloping.\n\nEdit: hilarious to see all the triggered people who don't understand Occam's Razor so they scream bigotry.

But me? to me sex and family are too completely separate things. sex is something incredibly private to me -  i don't talk about to anyone and talking about sex to my family is like... wtf would i associate them with *sex*? doing so puts in my head the image of sex and family in one and it's like...

You can just say you're done hanging out. But then when people don't do it to do that, then it's like you're a captive audience to this weirdly personal moment and you aren't expected to leave right now despite feeling uncomfortable so it's rude to leave and just like... eugh.

Set boundaries by telling your brother next time he repeats the pattern (telling you to tell hubby something), you say you aren\u2019t going to do triangles anymore and he can tell hubby himself.  And then change subject and if he persists, walk away, stop the phone call or text, or whatever it is.  There will be pushback. Your brother will try to get you back in the triangle.

Don\u2019t argue about, just execute it. \n\nActually OP, this behavior on brothers part is abusive and manipulative. Doesn\u2019t matter why he does it. Only matters to remove your part in it.  Some people will slowly change their part of the dance if you hold form on your change.  Some will persist and you might need to go NC for awhile. But that\u2019s a last resort.  The big bonus is that if you  can nail this, it will improve all your relationships. Good luck.!", "Nawh, but it was implied. Why do you hate women and lgbtq people?"]}
