She knows about my crochet business as I\u2019ve been talking about making one for years now and she\u2019s always supported me. This started a couple days ago, I was making my first order. I was so excited that someone wanted something from my shop. I couldn\u2019t stop talking about it. She asked if she could buy something from my shop. Obviously I said absolutely, her support means everything. \n\nShe then asked if she could have a discount price since \u201cno one would want to pay THAT much for something like that.\u201d I told her the price is based off of materials and my time put into these items I hand make. One plushie can take me hours, and that\u2019s on the swift side. She called me stuck up and said I had too big of an ego to think yarn put into shapes is worth the money I put them at. I tried to explain to her the appeal of handmade items and how priceless they can be, she called me an asshole for not just giving it to her for free. I told her that if she wanted to buy something from my shop, I\u2019m going to charge her my shop prices. \n\nIt\u2019s been a couple days and she won\u2019t speak to me unless it\u2019s to tell me that I\u2019m putting my own ego above her and that \u201cI guess 15 years means nothing to you.\u201d I\u2019m at a loss on what to do, she also is trying to convince my husband that I\u2019m in the wrong.

You've been friends a long time, and surely she has had opportunity before to buy items from you. However, now that you have a business and are getting your first orders, she is trying to squish your happiness and confidence by creating drama, acting entitled, and trying to devalue your work. I know from experience that OOAK handmade plushies are very expensive, and they are worth it to the people who buy them.

It went something like this:\n\n\"Hey /u/joegee66, I'm having a problem with my AOL. I think I've been hacked.\" Dude, I don't work for AOL, and your problems are you have AOL, and you're lame. I didn't say that.\n\nI replied something like \"I just worked sixteen hours at XYZ Corp, and I'm fried.\"\n\n\"But I'm your *friend*. This is your *job*.\"\n\nI remember thinking a *lot* of things to say, and not saying any of them. I was pissed. What came out of my mouth was:\n\n\"Your *job* is laying carpet, so ...

Good night.\" I hung up on him.\n\nI've got a friend who is an attorney. I've got a friend who is a medical doctor. I have artist friends.

Later, they actually looked at the item and had NO idea I had actually spent hours making it??\n\nI don't always agree with this idea of monetizing 100% of your activities, but if you're going to sell items as a side thing, you have to give yourself minimum wage, at the very least (if not more than that).

You overstepped now.", "NTA.\n\nI have a small crochet business too. Here's the unfortunate thing. Some people just don't understand the value of a handmade product.

In my opinion, you should consider ending this friendship.", "NTA. People that don\u2019t know how to crochet just don\u2019t get it. Stand your ground, true friends would want to give you all their support.", "NTA. I believe you should NEVER give a discount to somebody just because they are your friends.

If you have been experiencing other successes and milestones in your life and she hasn't, this may just be a \"tipping point\" for her, so to speak. It's sad to say, but most people's childhood friendships don't persist long into adulthood, especially once they start to get married or develop careers. It's easier to be friends when you're on the same playing field as kids, but when you're adults and disparities in lifestyles start to emerge, it gets harder to ignore them. It sounds like you're married and moving forward in your career and now also developing a solid hobby that even gives you some passive income. If she isn't in a similar position, she could be feeling left behind. It's on her to resolve those feelings within herself and learn to accept you as you move forward in life even if she isn't on the same path anymore or at least not on the same place on that path. If she can't resolve those feelings, she will keep acting out, and you will have to decide whether or not you can continue being her friend.  \n\n\nETA after reading your other comments: This is especially possible if she is used to you acquiescing to her when she gets jealous and pitches fits.

Out of curiosity, how much are you charging for the thing she wants?  I want to understand the full scope of the AH behavior here, but it's 100% clear she's the AH.  You're starting a business, not a charity.", "NTA.  This all escalated so quickly that there must be something else going on. \n\nAs a soaper I dipped my toes into starting a small business but making my hobby a job only made it a job.  I hated the stress of timelines and orders.", "She didn't even actually ask for a discount, she asked it for free. What a friend. Hard NTA", "Yeah this thing never really made sense for me, if they're your friends, isn't there more reason to buy and support them?", ">crochet's (sp?) \n\nYou spelled it right, but it doesn't need the apostrophe. Crochets.", "Here\u2019s the advice i was given about charging people for goods and services: you better be comfortable charging your friends full price because your enemies aren\u2019t going to be buying from you. \n\nNTA. Your time is worth something and you deserve to be paid for it. I don\u2019t know how long it takes you to make something, but i would guess you\u2019re probably undercharging for the amount of time it takes you to make an item anyways. Much less give something away for free after you\u2019ve been talking about trying to make a business out of it. \n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA, the amount of effort and skill that it takes is ridiculous!\n\nI love to crochet and knit and I refuse to do it for anyone because it\u2019s such an effort, and anyone who doesn\u2019t think so obviously has no idea what they are talking about!\n\nAlso, why is she calling your husband to complain about you? Like he\u2019s not your boss like he\u2019s not gonna like snap his fingers and tell you to do something bc he\u2019s your partner not anything else. what is wrong with her?", "You are absolutely not the asshole let me first start with that. \n\n\n\nI also sell on etsy and if one of my friends wants to purchase from me directly I will sometimes sell it to them for slightly more than I would have got from etsy but less than the original list price. So ill look at mt list price, what fees id have to pay etsy (aka crddit card and listing) and determine a reasonable price without all that...If that makes sense. Etsy has been screwing over the people on their site for years so if I can keep money out of their hands I am going to try to. \n\n\nJust something to consider if another friend asks to buy something from you.\n\nThis friend who is asking now though... she can go away. My friends won't ask me to discount my work. It is just something I odder because well I really hate the etsy company", "A good friend would pay your asking price and possibly more.  A good friend of mine commissioned me to crochet a blanket for her daughter (I crochet as a hobby but am also thinking about turning it into a legit side hustle).  Anyway, I quoted her a price and she zelled me two times the amount.  I was blown away and so appreciative.  I can't imagine her saying what your friend said and then wanting it for free.  Your friend is not an actual friend.", "Exactly. It seems like you\u2019d be ok with her not buying anything, but she insists on buying with a discount. That\u2019s her putting a price not you.", ".... and claiming at the same time that she is supporting what you do. Yeah, that's not what support looks like.\n\nSince my daughter opened up art commissions, I and some of her and my friends have signed up for pieces. All at listed prices. THAT's support.", "This!\n\nI can only do the most basic crochet, but I do needlepoint and embroidery, and make beaded jewelry, and decorate cookies. The friends who have asked to buy my things *wanted* to pay full price, both to support me and to recognize the time and effort I put into making them (and, of course, cover the cost of materials)."]}
