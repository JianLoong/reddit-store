Meanwhile I have always been informed and has to figure things out myself and grow up early on, she still sometimes acts like a child & as our relationship progresses this is starting ti become unattractive & exhausting. She always needs me to do everything with her and has zero self confidence or believe she can do things herself.  \n\nRecently, she wanted a new car. She\u2019s never bekihjt a car before so I spent whole weekend helping her visit dealerships and choose a car. The day she went to pick up the car she picked, I wasn\u2019t available so she went with her dad. At the time the dealership had a limit on how much you can put down via a debt card, so she put down half and needed to come back with the rest via a check(I was unaware of this). The dealership is about 25 miles from our home so it wasn\u2019t close. A few weeks go by and we get invited to my friends birthday at a brewery, she tells me we need to stop at the dealership because they called and they want to the rest of the deposit, I was confused and I was asked  why did you wait so long? And she said she wasn\u2019t gonna go unless me or or her dad could go with her and he wasn\u2019t available. I said okay whatever we will stop there.\n\nWe get to the place and all she needs to do is walk in and hand the guy a check and leave. So since parking was bad there, I suggested I drop her off, and while she is handing in the check, I can turn the car around so we can just keep going.\n\nWell rather than going inside she starts crying and panicking about how she can\u2019t go inside unless I go with her.

She starts crying and says she really needs her partner right now & I told Her no she needs to grow up, be an adult and learn to handle some stuff on her own. I told her letting her depend on me to be her buffer for the word isn\u2019t fair to her or me. She fussed but went in there and did it. And when she came out she said I\u2019m an asshole for not being supportive when she needed me.\n\nTl;dr My (27M) gf (25F) has bad anxiety and refuses to do anything on her own or be in any social situation. She needed to drop off a check at the dealership and rather than going in with her I told her to go herself, when she cried.

She cannot say \"I don't need a therapist I have you,\" that is NOT acceptable, nor is it fair to you. She is at the point where she's delaying necessary tasks to the point of jeopardizing things such as getting a new car because she refuses to go to these meetings alone, and that's not okay. Her anxiety is crippling her at this point, and her family coddling her is only making it worse.\n\nNow, that being said, telling her to \"Grow Up,\" was not the way. This is a legit mental health disorder, it's not something she can just \"Get over.\" But you have every reason to be frustrated: she dumped this on you at the last minute and turned a quick five minute stop to run into a check into something FAR longer with her panicked reaction, possibly making you late for your plans. I get how frustrating that would be!

That is not fair to him at all. I'm able to recognize this because of my high functioning. \n\nYour gf needs serious help. I would see what her trauma is to the anxious attachment.

Usually when someone forms an attachment like this, there is a specific reason for it. \n\nI know its not fair to you OP to have to deal with this, but she cant help it.

Now don\u2019t get me wrong, she does need to work on this very much and it\u2019s not fair to you at all. Complete agreement there. That said, I do feel that the time you chose this may have felt a bit extra cruel to her, basing it on how my own anxiety goes.\n\nBecause she waited for you to be available, she clearly expected you to go in with her and you in no way shut her down. Then when you\u2019re right in front of the place, you suddenly told her you will not come in after all. On top of this, you had an event (with likely a time you\u2019re supposed to be there at) you had to be at after which puts extra pressure on the situation. I just know this would send me into a really bad panic attack even for a small task. So while I\u2019m not going E S H since she isn\u2019t trying to get any better with therapy or anything else, I do think I\u2019m this particular moment with her crying you maybe should have put up with going in with her but discussed how you no longer want to be relied on like this me wouldn\u2019t be After that party", "NTA I would go for n-a-h if she was in the therapy and working on her issues.

Since you do not suffer from anxiety or panic disorder, you have absolutely no idea what it feels like. You have no idea why she is this way, if something happened to her as a child which she has not shared, or if it developed on its own. During a panic attack, one feels dissociated from one\u2019s own body. The heart races, skin tingles or numbs, and you hyperventilate. No matter how hard you pull air in, it feels like there is no oxygen and you\u2019re smothering while having a heart attack. Everyone says it feels like they are going to die. It doesn\u2019t matter if you find the trigger valid. If you were in that person\u2019s shoes, having a heart attack while being strangled, essentially, you would be terrified. Yet, since you\u2019re not in her shoes, you arrogantly dismiss what she\u2019s feeling with total contempt.\n\nYou are a terrible match for anyone with a mental or physical illness. \n\nA compassionate route would have been for you to learn all you could about anxiety and panic disorders, get her books by prominent authors, and encourage her to try behavior modification therapy. These disorders mean the amygdala of her brain signals that her life is in danger. She feels safe when with a trusted person like you or her father, because she felt protected. Therapy can help her internalize that feeling, and can be very helpful to prevent her developing agoraphobia.\n\nFinally, exposure therapy to desensitize someone to stimuli happens one small step at a time, with a safety net, backup plan, fair warning, and the agreement of the sufferer. All you did was flood her with terror by throwing her in the deep end. That\u2019s not therapy.", "Ugh! I couldn't deal with that kind of drama.  If u don't dump her through YTA but only to yourself.", "ESH.

Many women, even very experienced car buyers, don't go to dealerships without men because it simply makes for a smoother transaction without hassles for upsales, etc. I remember how intimidating it was for me as a first time buyer.", "In general NTA. But you need to decide if you're willing to give her what she needs, if not let her go and find someone who can support her.\n\nHowever, the way you did it, in the middle of a stressful situation makes YTA here. You should have saved the hard love for afterwards when you got home and explained that you can't always be there for her.", "YTA. She does need to go to therapy for her anxiety, for sure. However, a car dealership is one of those places where it is always good to go with someone else. Otherwise, it's just you against a salesperson and their office, and it's very easy to be taken advantage of. Pushing someone into a potentially unhealthy situation isn't encouraging them to be mature; it's just dumb. \n\nThis isn't a \"go alone and grow up\" situation.

It would have been much better to help her get over the situation and then in a calm moment sit down with her and tell her all those things.\nAlso, it might be appropriate to give her an ultimatum to go get therapy, as this current situation needs to be resolved by a professional.\n\nTorn between E S H and N A H, but I\u2018ll go with NAH here, as long as there will be adequate consequences regarding the situation.", "update?", "YTA for not dumping this girl sooner.\n\n>\tdoesn\u2019t need therapy when she has me\n\ni mean seriously. dump this girl ASAP.", "ESH. the things you're describing isn't something ypu grow out of so telling her to grow up does nothing but har.

Are you TA? I wouldn\u2019t say you are. You\u2019re not her parent and she should be able to function independently. You feelings of frustration are completely valid. I\u2019m sure when your relationship started you didn\u2019t intend to be where you two are now. Overtime you\u2019ve built up resentment and now it\u2019s causing you to behave in a way that\u2019s not how you\u2019d like to. Sounds like a learning experience.

I would avoid things that triggered my social anxiety as much as possible, and my mom didn't help. She coddled me and helicopter'd, which made it that much harder to do things myself. Sometimes, the stress was too much and I'd have anger/frustration fits. Really, it took my doctor being a little tough with me (after breaking down crying in the exam room over something) and telling me my anxiety was beyond out of control for me to start therapy and medication. I thought since I could 'function' I was fine... I really wasn't. \n\nThe thing that really hit it home for me was how my actions were negatively impacting my wife. She and I had a long conversation before I started medication, and I realized how much added stress I laid on her.

It's where you face your fears and learn to live with and eventuakly reduce the anxiety (it's much more complicated than that and involves the nervous systems but that's the tldr). \n\nA proper exposure therapy (or exposure response prevention) exercise is where you plan to face something that will make you produce a near intolerable anxiety response in an environment where you feel safe and gradually increase the \"risk\" as your distress tolerance increases.  \n\nSo OPs girlfriend might start with a very short phone call, a solo trip to a very familiar place where she's used to the transaction, or going in for the first few minutes and having a *willing* partner meet her halfway so she can finish the transaction for the first bit. \n\nSo a certain level of planning would be very helpful, and not just for children. Even outside of the CBT context (since she doesn't want therapy), planning out how she will complete the task on her own could be very helpful.\n\nWhen you're dealing with a mental health disorder it's not as single as \"just do it\". \n\nHowever, I'd like to use this comment to add in my judgment that OP is NTA, just inexperienced and frustrated with what seems like a serious mental health issue that's being coddled instead of treated. \n\nI can't wrap my head around the people who refuse help. I have an anxiety disorder and I HATE when in burdens others. I do what I can, including therapy, to keep the effect son my loved ones minimal. And what'd probably be shocking fir the gf, when I do that people aren't \"assholes\" (untrained and overwhealmed) to me about it like she said OP was. People won't help when you really need it if you dont help yourself. \n\nIf this very once in a blue moon big deal event of buying a car happened is too scary and she needs help WHILE she works on her issues to do it sure, but the fact that OP has had to take of work for appointments and dropping off a friggen amazon return is way too much to put on a partner.

I've have issues with anxiety and social nervousness since I was toddler. Does it makes life harder? Yes. Are there some things I'll avoid due to anxiety? Yes. But it's not excuse, just a limitation.

So many elderly who just have no one to talk to and are lonely. So many people with anxiety who need that other person to talk them down.

I just find ways to cope.", "you didn't, OP said that, that's what I'm refering too. the logic of saying ''life was never easy'' is honestly lost on me. it's like saying people have it worse than you, so what? that doesn't mean what someone is going through is any less valid. again, these things work for you, but it's not a one size fix all solution, explaining everything you went through doesn't change that. I'm not saying you had it easy here either, but if I list everything I went through it doesn't really change anything for others either", "Ok still doesn't excuse how he spoke to her.  Like I said ESH", "Where did I say she should avoid therapy. Lol y'all are wild.", "Meh, there's three sides to this.  \n\nOPs\n\nOPs GF\n\nAnd the objective truth\n\nWhy is op with this woman after 3 years of this?", ">probably makes her feel like it\u2019s not even a legitimate problem and that might deter her from getting therapy.\n\nShe obviously already believes it's not a legitimate problem ahe needs therapy for because that's what she has other people for.\n\nThey have been together for three years. It's likely that he did help and support her those past three years but he is rather tired of being made 100% responsable for someone else's life who refuses to grow up and do literally anything by themselves. Because that's what she does and maybe someone does need to tell her that for once so she either gets her life together or if that's not possible realizes she's got a bloody problem and needs help.\nCoddling her obviously didn't do anything for her those past years.\n\nHe is not being absolutely horrible to her. He is just confronting her with reality and not willing to live in her denial anymore.\n\nSo you think instead of confronting her for once the person who she loves and trusts the most should just give up on her instantly and break up. How is that better?", "That's fine, and I won't go back and forth with you after this but understand your discussing a symptom of a problem and rather than the actual problem and it's not fair to give a pass just bc this one instance could prove difficult aka dealership. Op is also discussing this as the straw that broke the camels back, meaning it's happening a lot and I doubt she's buying cars every year. \n\nOp is not the GFs care giver and not his responsibility. As many say, you are not at fault for your mental difficulties, but you are responsible for it and if she literally states OP is her replacement for therapy that is highly unfair and problematic. In what world is your partner supposed to be qualified to handle mental issues and succeed at something that requires extensive accreditation and schooling for?", "Not saying its not valid, but everyone learns on their own. Ops girlfriend will forever be stuck in a loop, because people around her are validating what she is feeling.  That's not help. She needs professional help. The kind that makes you brake the cycle.  If she doesn't want it that is on her.", "People need wakeup calls.\n\n\nI doubt this was their first conversation, and he seems to have been patient with it this far.", "Well, I say NTA because she's a grown adult refusing to get help.", "Telling someone to grow up isn\u2019t the worst thing. He didn\u2019t call her names or cuss at her or scream until she cowered into a ball on the ground. \n\nAnd he was frustrated to be put on the spot last minute, over something as small as walking into a building and handing a person a check. She had a full-on meltdown. Of course he got frustrated. This is normal, it\u2019s wearing on him as a partner.", "He did not say anything wrong or rude to her. Nothing in what he said needs excusing. Are you like the gf? That\u2019s why you are hell bent on making OP the AH?\n\nI guess you are talking about \u201cgrow up\u201d. So according to you just those two words make him an AH? Yeah he could have worded it better but it doesn\u2019t make him bad.", "Absolutely does. He didn't say anything that wasn't true, she sounds like such an exhausting person.", "People stay in shitty relationships for all sorts of reasons- but from experience, it's hard to leave someone who is entirely dependant on you. When you're used to being a persons mental health crutch, pulling away means watching them fall and the guilt of that has a way of narrowing one's perspective.\n\nFact remains the woman was dropping off a cheque for a car that's in her possession. Its a simple exchange, and im gonna give OP a pass on being human and snapping at her for being ridiculous. Good on him for not buying that guilt trip at the end either.", "I'm not arguing with you about the overall situation of her mental issues. She clearly needs help and is the asshole since she refuses to get it. I am just saying that was a stupid time to pick his tough love moment due to the situation she was going into. Does she have issues cashing a check at the bank? Maybe. That would be a prime time to do this tough love thing. Nothing is at stake in that situation. But right then and there was a bad choice for his lesson. I've never said he needs training.  \n\nSo, no he is not in the wrong for his OVERALL situation. He is a dick for doing it while the car is running and not in a parking spot and planning on pulling the car around. Asshole no, kind of a dick for where he was yeah. As I said there are better places for this stupid lesson.", "but that's not what I'm saying, you're making it seem like I'm trying to suggest she doesn't need help and that should be okay, that's not what I'm suggesting. I'm simply saying it's more complicated than ''go to therapy''. if she goes, and doesn't fully embrace it it will be a waste of time, and she'll only be stuck in the same loop AND think therapy doesn't work, bringing her right back to where she started.", "Not only did she wait for a while until someone was available to take her, she stated how anxious this made her. For him to then turn around and call her a cry baby is an asshole move. Especially when OP is very aware that she has MH issues. Stop being surprised when mentally Ill people do mentally Ill things? Don\u2019t expect them to behave in ways you see as appropriate. And stop expecting them to just \u201cgrow up\u201d or \u201cget a grip\u201d because that\u2019s not how MH works. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed medicines and people have spent their life trying to treat people with MH issues,", "Because I think both people suck I'm \n\n>hell bent on making OP the AH?\n\nDid you even think about what you wrote before posting?", "Read the edit.\n\nYou don't inconvenience others because of your mental illness, the girlfriend needs help because she cannot always rely on OP or her father because it's not healthy.", "Yes I did", "My main point still stands. OP in an adult who is well aware of the situation, her beliefs and her abilities. You can not all of a sudden decide she has to do more in moments you want her too? Like fair she need therapy. But OP is also enabling and was an asshole. Regardless you shouldn\u2019t speak to people like that?", "How is picking up a car with your gf an inconvenience? When you are very aware she would need help to do so, and she has asked numerous times for someone to take her? Like maybe just don\u2019t date someone with MH issues then? That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not saying she doesn\u2019t need therapy but OP shouldn\u2019t just expect people to change when it\u2019s convenient for him.", "They both suck"]}
