Meanwhile I have always been informed and has to figure things out myself and grow up early on, she still sometimes acts like a child & as our relationship progresses this is starting ti become unattractive & exhausting. She always needs me to do everything with her and has zero self confidence or believe she can do things herself.  \n\nRecently, she wanted a new car. She\u2019s never bekihjt a car before so I spent whole weekend helping her visit dealerships and choose a car. The day she went to pick up the car she picked, I wasn\u2019t available so she went with her dad. At the time the dealership had a limit on how much you can put down via a debt card, so she put down half and needed to come back with the rest via a check(I was unaware of this). The dealership is about 25 miles from our home so it wasn\u2019t close. A few weeks go by and we get invited to my friends birthday at a brewery, she tells me we need to stop at the dealership because they called and they want to the rest of the deposit, I was confused and I was asked  why did you wait so long? And she said she wasn\u2019t gonna go unless me or or her dad could go with her and he wasn\u2019t available. I said okay whatever we will stop there.\n\nWe get to the place and all she needs to do is walk in and hand the guy a check and leave. So since parking was bad there, I suggested I drop her off, and while she is handing in the check, I can turn the car around so we can just keep going.\n\nWell rather than going inside she starts crying and panicking about how she can\u2019t go inside unless I go with her. I told her no I\u2019m not going to do that and that she needs to start believing in herself & facing her fears and that she can\u2019t depend on me to be there Every-time or wait till I\u2019m available. She starts crying and says she really needs her partner right now & I told Her no she needs to grow up, be an adult and learn to handle some stuff on her own. I told her letting her depend on me to be her buffer for the word isn\u2019t fair to her or me. She fussed but went in there and did it. And when she came out she said I\u2019m an asshole for not being supportive when she needed me.\n\nTl;dr My (27M) gf (25F) has bad anxiety and refuses to do anything on her own or be in any social situation. She needed to drop off a check at the dealership and rather than going in with her I told her to go herself, when she cried. I told her to grow up.\n\nEDIT: I would like to add she\u2019s against therapy and says she doesn\u2019t need therapy when she has me.

She cannot say \"I don't need a therapist I have you,\" that is NOT acceptable, nor is it fair to you. She is at the point where she's delaying necessary tasks to the point of jeopardizing things such as getting a new car because she refuses to go to these meetings alone, and that's not okay. Her anxiety is crippling her at this point, and her family coddling her is only making it worse.\n\nNow, that being said, telling her to \"Grow Up,\" was not the way. This is a legit mental health disorder, it's not something she can just \"Get over.\" But you have every reason to be frustrated: she dumped this on you at the last minute and turned a quick five minute stop to run into a check into something FAR longer with her panicked reaction, possibly making you late for your plans. I get how frustrating that would be! But you snapped, and that's not how you should be handling this.\n\nYou need to sit your girlfriend down an tell her point blank: \"I love you, and I DO support you, but there's a difference between supporting you through getting BETTER and coddling you while you remain trapped by this condition, unable to function without someone with you.

That is not fair to him at all. I'm able to recognize this because of my high functioning. \n\nYour gf needs serious help. I would see what her trauma is to the anxious attachment.

I get why you don\u2019t want to enable her but at the same time you did nothing to comfort her and prepare her to even try and do it by herself. She obviously needs to get therapy and possibly meds for anxiety if it\u2019s this bad and since she refuses you need to decide whether you want to continue a relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t want to get help and either enable her or move on so that you and her can be with someone who will be better suited for both of you. I honestly hope she gets help at some point but as long as she has people to enable her it\u2019s not going to happen.", "NTA. Sounds exhausting", "ESH. Yeah, she needs to learn to manage her anxiety but you could have just parked the car and gone in with her after seeing her distress.

You are not a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist. You are not equipped to treat her mental health issues and it's not your responsibility.

I suffer from codependency and panic disorder myself and know that exposure therapy (aka facing my fears) is the only thing that's helped me get through it all these years. You just want her to be able to survive on her own, and that's actually more helpful than pandering to her illness.
