Essentially, my goes onto social media sites, and picks a random person that has a weird username. She goes through their posts, does a bunch research, finds out every little aspect of their identity she can, and learns every little thing about them. Their name, where they live, their contact info, their family, their job, their life story, everything. And then, she contacts them, telling them all the information she could find on them, and asks if she got it right. They usually reply with \"do not contact this number again\", or some variation of it. And she just gets immense satisfaction from this. It's like a research project to her. And this is her only hobby, this is what she does besides working and watching TV.\n\nOver thanksgiving break, I was home from college, as well as all my other siblings. And she was happily describing her latest research, about how she found someone who fled an abusive relationship on College Confidential. And contacted them. With their name, address, and a whole bunch of their information.\n\nI told her she has to stop doing this, and that she probably scared the living shit out of her, making her think that her abusive ex had found her. Then she replied with \"Well, if she's scared about it, then why does she have all that information readily available?\" She looked very angry at me for calling her out, but kept her composure when talking.\n\nArguments ensued, people took sides. On one hand, this was the only hobby she has and is her only source of enjoyment, and is showing why you should never post personal information on the internet. On the other hand, she is making people feel very unsafe. And her reply was \"But they aren't safe if I can find all of this info on them online! That's what I'm trying to tell you!\"\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if she found this and figures out it's me. Any suggestions on how I can convince her to stop?\n\nEDIT: I am going to talk to her over Christmas break about putting her skills to better use by doing it consensually. I am not considering contacting the police or getting her arrested for this. And you guys brought up a very good point about her maybe doing it to the wrong person and getting in danger, I hadn't considered that before.", "created_utc": 1670129987, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc0yum/aita_for_calling_out_my_mom_for_her_creepy_hobby/", "score": 363, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The people on the receiving end of this are the ones who get to decide this, not OP's mom, and they've apparently made their feelings on the matter quite clear. \n\nThere's a place for what the mom is doing, but she needs consent, or at the very least needs to drastically soften her approach, in order to not be TA about it.\n\nOP is NTA for calling this out.", "A Hallmark Original Movie!\n\nEdit: I would say Lifetime but is that still around?", "Honestly after watching Catfish, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if OP\u2019s mom has already catfished a few people", "> Cyberstalking is a type of cybercrime that uses the internet and technology to harass or stalk a person.\n\nIt literally fits the definition.", "If she is so good at this, she could be able to make a career out of this. For example, many people who get cyberbullied or have kids that get cyberbullied may want to figure out the identity of the cyberbullies. You mother could do this with the cyberbullies of people paying her to scare them off. She can use this skill for the social good of society and likely make good money from it to.", "It would be a great idea if she could put these skills to use for the greater good!\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know why, but your username tickled me to no end.", "Check out notkahnjunior on tiktok", "I saw this too. You can just search consensual doxxing on TikTok and Google. FWIW, it\u2019s probably how her brain works and she probably feels a jolt of endorphins from \u201csolving a case.\u201d She shouldn\u2019t feel bad it\u2019s a skill and she\u2019s good at it. But the way she\u2019s going about it is unethical and makes people feel bad, so she should look for new and more ethical ways of channeling her skills.

Once she discovers them she'll get even *more* info on a person. \n\nI've found so many subjects by finding their relatives or associates first. \n\nOne guy was completely off the grid. No socials, np photos, no utilities, no working email, nothing on TLO, nada. Zilch.\n\nI got his reflection in the background of a photo posted to his sister's Facebook account of her and their mother on mother's day. He wasn't in any other photos and I couldn't even make out his face. But he took the photo and the framed picture behind them got his reflection. I was able to track down the logo on his shirt which ended up being his place of employment. \n\nIt took me two seconds to confirm it was him by calling for an employment verification with the last four of his SSN.\n\nGod forbid she pays a subscription to one of those ancestry sites. The people wouldn't even have a chance. It'd be like shooting fish in a barrel.", "Is report the mom to the cops or whoever deals w this. No doubt they could get testimonies as well", "Yeah, she's gross.

White hat hackers get paid very well to do what your mom does by finding exploits in companies security.", "All of those things you list are crimes.  Looking up people's publicly available information isn't.", "Good.
