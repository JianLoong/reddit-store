And no, you did not take anyone's spot, you've been chosen by the panel. NTA, of course.", "NTA. I know a white attorney who went there, mainly because she wanted to learn about race issues \"without white people being in the narrative.\" I think that's pretty cool, but I'm also white, so maybe I'm wrong.", "NTA. Black woman here. HBCUs are not exclusively for Black students. I'm sure you are far from the only white person on campus. Pease ignore the people telling you that your in the wrong.

It\u2019s racist to consider the color of your skin at all.

I\u2019m going soft YTA because I do think that school is designed to help people who would not otherwise be embraced by law schools in part because of their racial heritage.  But I understand why you would want to get a law degree that could help people. \n\n\nThat being said I\u2019ve taken the lsat, graduated law school, and passed the bar exam. And it is hard work. Not as hard as medical school but still really hard. And the pay off is not that great. I\u2019m making decent money for the first time this year and I\u2019m eight years in. But mostly, let me just say that if you didn\u2019t have high lsat scores, you could be very smart, but tests are just not something you are good at. And I want to be clear\u2014in law school your whole grade for a whole class is based on one test at the end. There\u2019s no extra credit. No making up. No chance to do better. The bar exam is a two to three day living test nightmare. Your career will hang on the balance of your ability to take a test for days while stressed out of your mind and highly dehydrated. And if you think the LSAT costs money, then consider the four months you have to live between May and the fall of the year you graduate. There\u2019s a several thousand dollar bar prep class and living expenses and the bar application fee. There\u2019s a reason the legal profession is full of rich kids.  If you decide to see this through be certain you want to put yourself through all that. I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into and I\u2019m good at tests. I still didn\u2019t get any As my whole first year.", "All college admissions should be race, gender, orientation free.
