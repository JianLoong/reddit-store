The HBCU admitted you. Anyone with a problem can take it up with the administration.", "Congratulations! You are facing uneasy time there because you will be (ta-damm!) a minority among other students and some might tell you are there just for diversity, which is not true. And no, you did not take anyone's spot, you've been chosen by the panel. NTA, of course.", "NTA. I know a white attorney who went there, mainly because she wanted to learn about race issues \"without white people being in the narrative.\" I think that's pretty cool, but I'm also white, so maybe I'm wrong.", "NTA. Black woman here. HBCUs are not exclusively for Black students. I'm sure you are far from the only white person on campus. Pease ignore the people telling you that your in the wrong. I suggest you watch the video below. It's a vice story about a white guy going to an HBCU. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ccZk_e3Tc5s", "As a graduate of two HBCUs, one being Howard university who has a law school. There is no reason to think YTA HBCUs have all kinds of students the majority yes are black but once you hit graduate level the classes diversify even more in the law, medical, pharmacy and dental schools. You got in that's all that matters. Good luck and study hard.", "NTA.... first congrats... second every one saying you're wrong are the AH... them same people will need you to help them out...\nKeep up the good work.. and no you're not going to stand out", "Did they know you were white when they accepted you?  If they did then NTA!", "NTA\n\nBeing very familiar with the legal field, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a smart financial decision for you but you\u2019re not an AH. Before you spend $200k, make sure you have a realistic idea about your career prospects.", "Congratulations and best wishes \n\nNTA", "NTA congrats and yes you should go.", "NTA \n\nDon't let them project their \"anti-racist\" actually racist ideals on you. If the university didn't want you, they wouldn't have admitted you. These people want to tear you down and see you fail, they want to drink you tears. Be strong, be the best lawyer you can be!", "NTA\nThat will be a very unpopular answer but seriously\u2026the school accepted you and I\u2019m guessing they know you are white. It\u2019s racist to consider the color of your skin at all. HBCUs aren\u2019t for only black students, if so that is quite literally discrimination which we fought so hard to break in this country.\n\nCongratulations on getting accepted! Proud of you :)", "NTA\n\nGo and have a blast!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"since then I\u2019ve had a number of friends, coworkers, and even future classmates berate me because my spot could\u2019ve gone to another black or minority student\" .. so these racist AHs would exclude you from that university because of your race?", "That\u2019s a very complex ethical question that even the Supreme Court couldn\u2019t properly wrestle with. I\u2019m going soft YTA because I do think that school is designed to help people who would not otherwise be embraced by law schools in part because of their racial heritage.  But I understand why you would want to get a law degree that could help people. \n\n\nThat being said I\u2019ve taken the lsat, graduated law school, and passed the bar exam. And it is hard work. Not as hard as medical school but still really hard. And the pay off is not that great. I\u2019m making decent money for the first time this year and I\u2019m eight years in. But mostly, let me just say that if you didn\u2019t have high lsat scores, you could be very smart, but tests are just not something you are good at. And I want to be clear\u2014in law school your whole grade for a whole class is based on one test at the end. There\u2019s no extra credit. No making up. No chance to do better. The bar exam is a two to three day living test nightmare. Your career will hang on the balance of your ability to take a test for days while stressed out of your mind and highly dehydrated. And if you think the LSAT costs money, then consider the four months you have to live between May and the fall of the year you graduate. There\u2019s a several thousand dollar bar prep class and living expenses and the bar application fee. There\u2019s a reason the legal profession is full of rich kids.  If you decide to see this through be certain you want to put yourself through all that. I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into and I\u2019m good at tests. I still didn\u2019t get any As my whole first year.", "All college admissions should be race, gender, orientation free. Congrats.", "Good thing Affirmative Action was eliminated based on race for admission and you was admitted on your qualifications.", "Info - I'm unfamiliar with the American system re HBCUs.  \n\nI am wondering if you consulted anyone prior to accepting this admission and inquired whether it would be awkward, socially acceptable, etc., to accept? \n\nAgain, unfamiliar with this system. However, if you didnt do any research about the conventions involved here, I'm not sure it would be an asshole necessarily, but stupid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anyway HBCUs are still predominately black but they admit people from all races and from all over the world. White people are definitely the minority, most students don't care but some do.
