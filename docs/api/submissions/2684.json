If you are not home, your sister will have to either start planning ahead and asking you, or she will have to figure out her own shit or cancel her plans. I'm sure the 14 year old had a phone; she will not freeze; she will just have to go back to her mom's car.", "Yeah, if I was OP, I would park my car in the garage (if possible) and pretend not to be home.", "How is OP the asshole??", "\u201cNo Regerts\u201d", "Considering the age of this \"mother\", no computer + fancy restaurants combo and leaving her 14yo whenever, you should contact child protection services.

If her daughter is going to come over it should be on your terms only from now on.", "Wow that\u2019s really saying something. Your sister sounds like a piece of work.

A camera doorbelll is a great solution for OP", "You can\u2019t judge the niece for not being the aunt the 14 year old \u201cneeds\u201d. That\u2019s not here responsibility. She didn\u2019t tell her sister to have a kid.As she said she loves her niece, but the 14 year olds parents are the ones she needs.", "NTA", "NTA but poor kid :(", "She is going overboard period.\n\n I'd tell her the next time she just drops off the kid without notice, you will be taking your niece to the police station saying you found this abandoned child at your door.  This may be going overboard, but she is on notice. Sometimes you have to be an asshole to assholes. And she will have to just start to get a babysitter. If she has enough money for a fancy restaurant, she has enough for a babysitter.\n\nBeing family doesn't give one a license to give no respect.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Get a peephole installed in the door. When you see the scenario occur again, simply don't open the door and silence your phone.", "Nta tell the husband if she not with Jim. Let him know she can be left home alone.", "You're NOT the asshole. Your sister is.", "NTA, Jesus. I\u2019ve seen it more commonly on this sub with babies or young children, but a freshman in high school? I think she\u2019s old enough to stay home by herself for a few hours while mom and dad have a date night. Honestly, just don\u2019t answer the door next time. Pretend you\u2019re not home.", "Clearly NTA.", "Your sister is definitely the A hole. Who the hell does she think she is? You're not a permanent baby sister nor are you the mother. You have a life and she obviously thinks that your life should revolve around hers and that's definitely not on. What you did was absolutely amazing and I truly hope that your sister has now got the message.", "NTA. Sister is. Loved your solution!", "NTA.\nI'd call the cops for child abandonment.\n\nWhy can't this 14-year old stay by herself?", "Info: did you let awesome niece know whybyoubwere dropping her back off and that she is not a problem?", "\"Play stupid games get stupid prizes\" is something I've seen around and I feel like your sister should receive some kind of consequences for her actions. The downside is a 14 year old girl is suffering. It probably doesn't feel good to her that mom doesn't want her around (nor wants her to have any fun apparently) and that her aunt did the same thing mom did. No your sister shouldn't be doing what she's doing and you have every right to not want to watch her, but mom drops her off and takes off and then you do the same...  Who knows how your niece is feeling about it. I feel for the poor kid. At the same time she's not really a kid and 14 is old enough to stay home if mom is having a date night. \n\nIf you're hesitant to stop opening the door I suggest getting a ring doorbell with a camera to see who is on the otherside. \n\nI saw one of your comments saying you were unsure of what your sister would do if your niece turned around and started walking back the car... That gave me pause. Do you think your sister would still leave her or have a negative reaction and take it out on her daughter? If its the latter there are bigger problems at play. Hell if its the first thats not any better because thats clear abandonment. I guess taking off once you open the door is also abandonment. What a messy situation. Again I feel for your niece.\n\nOh, NTA.", "NTA. The 14yo is old enough to babysit other people's children. Let the well-behaved teenager stay home alone and start practicing independence.", "NTA I\u2019d have reported her for abandoning her child without permission long ago.", "NTA but your sister is. She is taking advantage of you! Don't answer the door anymore, look out the window first or get a ring and see who it is on your phone first. \n\nI hate it when people walk all over you and expect you to drop everything at a moments notice. Why can't the kid stay home?", "NTA - wow... Talk about no respect for you. You need to set boundaries like yesterday", "Nta, your sister is careless and selfish. She needs to arrange for things like this. Also 14 is old enough to be left alone for a couple hours. Not overnight but a couple of hours won't hurt.", "Wait so your sister left her daughter and drove off one time without any notice for an entire weekend? That\u2019s CPS notifying level of abandonment. Also the whole thing is weird at this point because her daughter is old enough to stay home alone for a bit and/or have friend sleepovers.", "NTA. Enforce boundary rigidly that you only mind her when you are asked AND agree. And that you are happy to do it when its feasible for you, but not otherwise. But surely 14 is old enough to be left alone at home for a short period of time. And longer periods like the weekend absolutely need to be convenient to you, not at sisters convenience.", "NTA. You\u2019re a legend.", "NTA. This is such a reasonable boundary for you to have.", "NTA. Your sister gets no say over what you do to entertain/feed her kid when she drops her off unexpectedly.", "NTA. First off, the niece is 14 and should be reasonably able to be at home for a couple hours while parents are on a date. Second, your sister is absolutely abusing your generosity.   \nI feel bad for your niece.   \n\n\nInstead of leaving opportunity to be ding, dong, ditched by sis, stop by the house and grab the niece after school and take her somewhere for ice cream and hang out and return her home. Conversations for those visits can be life advice that helps point her away from behaving like her entitled ass mother.", "NTA, but damn, I feel awful for your niece. I can\u2019t imagine being the 14 year-old who gets bounced around to adults that feel constantly inconvenienced by her presence. \n\nThat, however, is not your problem. It\u2019s her parents\u2019 problem and they need to start acting like they can\u2019t just drop their kid off with no notice and pretend they\u2019re in the 20s again.", "Fuck this shit. \n\nTALK TO YOUR NEICE. Is she being verbally/emotionally/physically abused and/or neglected? She\u2019s 14! She is old enough to make decisions about what she does with her time, within reasonable boundaries. She doesn\u2019t need a sitter for fuck\u2019s sake. \n\nYour sister and her husband are obviously AH. \n\nBut your whole dramatic leaving your niece at the restaurant makes YTA. \n\nYour niece is a person, not a fruitcake to be passed around. \n\nJesus Christ.", "ok common how do you post this asking whos the asshole\n\nits your sister obviously. this is a no brainer", "Nta but call police for abandonment. This still counts at this age", "INFO:\n\nDid you talk with your sister about this?\n\nWhen taking your niece to the restaurant did you talked with your nieve before?", "Absolutely NTA! It is absurd for anyone to think they can leave their kid with someone without notice - or in this case, without even asking! - outside of an emergency.", "NTA this sounds like a mild case of child abandonment.", "NTA. But your sister and husband sure af are. How horrible to just dump your child and run. Have ridiculous rules for them even when they aren\u2019t around. Good grief. Sometimes I wish it wasn\u2019t so easy for some ppl to have babies.", "NTA. You have a life of your own and you do not work for your sister. A little courtesy would go a long way. I would make sure she understood this in no uncertain terms.", "NTA. I would have sat down and ordered a meal on their tab too.", "Poor kid", "I was babysitting at 14 with no supervision.", "NTA - your SISTER is TA.\n\nSolutions here:\n\nGet one of these camera door bells. That way you can see who it is before you open the door. You simply don\u2019t go and your niece has to get back into the car. \n\nIt takes time to teach a lesson. But after time #30 your sister might be tired of making these pointless drives to your house.", "At least she has a good aunt.", "Now that's not right.\n8???\nWhat state is this, Indiana?", "That's her problem, not yours.", "I wouldn't say OP allows it, her sister takes off before she can say anything from the sounds of it", "I would call your sister that her behavior is no longer accepted. If she does that one more time, she will have repercussions (CPS or police will be called, you will dropp the kid wherever the mother is, etc).\n\nInstall cameras and if it's your sister, don't open the door.", "Tell her the next time she does this you\u2019ll be calling the police to report her for child abandonment. And follow through.", "If 14 is old enough to work in most places, it's old enough to stay home alone for a couple hours. \n\nI did babysitting jobs when I was 13, taking care of other people's kids whilst the parents went out. 14 is old enough to be alone. Regardless, this is still neglect, and you were right to refuse it, but the kid can be alone.", "Start bringing your niece along with you to your plans!", "Go grocery shopping with your niece. She's old enough and can be helpful.", "My mom started leaving me home alone at 8, but only because I\u2019ve always been sickly and her and my dad didn\u2019t have available PTO, so she had to go into work for a few hours. But she always made sure I had the phone and knew her work number. She also called me every half an hour. Of course, it was Kentucky in the 90s, which is right next to Indiana.", "I'm in Ohio and there is no law about when kids may be left home alone.  (It looks like most states don't actually have a law.)  It's more about having them be safe.  -- I think there should be a minimum across the board, but 8 is probably fine for less than an hour.  It really depends on the kid.   \n\nMy son is 12 and stays by himself while me and his little sister run errands, he has for a couple years now.  He also has grandparents who live 5 minutes away and lots of people in the neighborhood that he can reach out to in case of an emergency.  We've talked about what to do in different situations and he's not allowed to have friends over while I'm gone.", "Maryland", "r/usdefaultism", "Agreed, OP is being way too passive here. Start calling around other family members and saying that sister abandoned niece at your doorstep and you have no idea where she is and are worried.

I\u2019m worried that she\u2019s taken off. I\u2019m about to file a missing persons report I\u2019m so worried\u2019. Call police and report child abandonment.
