The shops that will tattoo a 14 year old are usually not the safest.", "It\u2019s incredible that she still has a sense of humor after being abandoned on a doorstep so many times. My self esteem would be in the GUTTER after the first time.", ">Don't do the tattoo--that could get you in legal trouble. (some mother got in trouble-in Texas for her 10 yr old son getting a tattoo)", "You\u2019re right to an extent. It\u2019s kinda gross to have sex and let your kids hear it. As natural as sex is no one wants to hear someone else doing it.. unless you\u2019re into that sorta stuff.", "and tell her if she drops her off again you will call the police and follow through", "Parents have sex all the time without their kids hearing it. Most parents don\u2019t get a babysitter every time they get their groove on.", "Not your problem. She can forego a few expensive meals and buy a computer.", "Does the niece cover the peephole? Lol who doesn't look first?!", "Exactly.   I usually go to the adjacent window and peak out.  Then if I see it probably isn't threatening I'll step fully into the window and ask what they want. I generally don't open the door anymore though.", "I would have called the cops for child abandonment when sister left niece for an entire *weekend* without notice. Niece is a minor. That's not okay even if she's 14. None of sister's behavior is okay. I feel bad for your niece, maybe sit down and have a long talk about how you're going to be setting and enforcing boundaries with her mother. That it doesn't mean you don't love her, but her mom needs to learn to respect you and your time/space.\n\nIf sister keeps it up, not even kidding, the only thing that might wake her up is outside intervention like CPS.\n\nOP you're NTA.", "One message might be worth it.

I could stay home by myself when I was 10!", "At 12 years old it's common for kids to start babysitting in Ontario.", "Technically, it's 16 to be left alone overnight. 12+ for a few hours before or after school. 14 should be fine home alone for date night.", "Try it at least once to see.", "If you can park your car somewhere that your sister can\u2019t see, get yourself a video doorbell. When sister tries to drop off niece, just don\u2019t answer the door. Call your sister and tell her your doorbell shows your niece but you\u2019re not home, so sorry. Repeat as needed.\n\nGood luck. Your sis is a piece of work.", "There's no set age in California, it's up to the parents to decide. At one point while growing up, I was being paid to babysit a classmate of one of my younger siblings, while that sibling and the one a few years younger than them stayed home by themselves. I was also babysitting infants when I was 12 ish, and while yes, I was an exceptionally responsible kid it also boils down to lol 80's.

I feel that op has the opportunity to be the person her niece needs. If op doesn\u2019t give a shit, that\u2019s on her. In the world I believe in, people care about each other.

But why not make the best of your time with the niece?  NTA but you\u2019re maybe focusing on the wrong things", "NTA. Why are you the designated babysitter for a 14 year old?!

This poor girl would probably rather go to a friend's house instead of yours.\n\n2. Your sis needs to understand that she is a parent, and that parents don't get to decide when they aren't parents.\n\n3. You actually let her get upset that you let her play your play station? If I were in your situation,100% the next time my niece comes over I am loading them up on caffeine, sugar, video games, and television they aren't supposed to be watching. I would let the teenage girl decide when, where, and how they do their homework, and go to bed. I would send that kid back being corrupted as they want to be.\n\n4. Your sister isn't paying you?\n\n5. Your sister can afford to pay for fancy dinners, but what? Only for her and her husband, not her child, and only if she again, has free child care?\n\n6. And quite possibly the most important point, the child is old enough to stay at home for a night, or even a weekend by herself.", "Isn't that \"child\" abandonment? Maybe Child Services should be called...", "NTA. She dumbed her without notice for an entire weekend?? Yeah your sister is TA.", "NTA, but how the heck do you pronoune your username?", "Nta", "I would just stay up late with my nephew/niece eating junk food and playing video games every time.\nAnd if their parent complains, I will tell them to raise their own kids instead of dropping them on me to parent.\nOther than emergencies, If I don't get the respect and courtesy of a heads up, I am not going to be a parent to someone else's kid. I am going to be the fun uncle who only adds headaches for parents to sort out.", "Why should she give you notice it always works and you babysit", "NTA - that is soooo rude to drop and dash a kid!!! She has to start giving you a days notice or you can take the 14 yr old home.", "NTA, but please don't listen to these people who say don't open the door. That's not going to teach your sister a lesson, it's just going to leave the kid out in the cold. She doesn't deserve to be punished for your sister's terrible actions. And even if you don't open the door, who's to say your sister won't just leave anyway? Then what? I mean, call the cops for neglect, absolutely, but leaving a kid outside is still pretty cold (pun intended?) and you sound like you really do care about your niece.\n\nOn the other hand, you're the *aunt*. Aunts exist to spoil their nieces. Don't have healthy food? Hell yeah kid, we're getting pizza. Homework done? Meh, who cares, fire up the Playstation. What is the *worst* color you can think of that you love but would make your mother's head explode? Let's hit the pharmacy and get some temporary hair dye. Send her home and block your sister's number. Honestly, if you trust your niece, *you* could leave her home for a few hours while you go out and do something. As long as she's safe in a house and knows how to take care of herself, things should be fine. \n\nObviously what you do is up to you, but I really do hope the niece can suffer as little as possible here. She's just a kid. It's not her fault.", "NTA\n\nThat is really unacceptable behavior. Your niece deserves better parents.", "Primo move, OP, of driving niece to the fancy restaurant, walking her to sister\u2019s table, and handing her off. Love this \ud83d\udcaf!

I do feel for the kid though, she must think nobody enjoys spending time with her", "NTA. You need to lay out some very firm boundaries and stop allowing this to happen. Your sister is hugely disrespecting and taking advantage of you and simply bets on you going along with it because you love your niece.", "NTA. Your sister should tell you when she's going to drop her kid off, it's as simple as that", "NTA \nAdvance warning should be the norm at a minimum,\nA request \u201ccan she come from date/time to date/time\u201d is what smart, intelligent, and considerate people do.\n\nShe (your sister) displays none of those qualities.

I'd fake ring the bell and since the folks would have driven off- I'd just leave and go do what I wanted. No way in hell I would have waited for someone who clearly didn't want me there to open the door. Again, wtf, your entire family seems weird.", "NTA.  Man what kind of family does that.  That's unheard of in my family.  Talk to your sister.", "Jesus, what a shitty thing to do to you and that poor kid.", "You said you didn't live in the US?", "Look out the window before you open the door, it's safer. It might even allow you to go enjoy your plans. A couple of times of you not being available, might fix this situation.", "Yours too lol", "Age 16 to be left alone overnight without reasonable supervision. Not for a few hrs for a date night.

Shes 14, not 4.", "Or she could just get her sister\u2019s spare key and drive her niece back to her house.  She\u2019s 14.  She\u2019s old enough to be alone and, frankly, the responsibility of being alone by herself would probably be good for her.", "Op said not in the US...", "I don\u2019t recall anyone suggesting anything like that.", "That's when I started. Even babysat my friend's brother's. She wasn't allowed because I turned 12 b4 her."]}
