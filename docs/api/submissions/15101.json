She wanted to know how much was he was paying me. I told her I was just doing it for free to help him out until he finds something else. \n\nThen she got upset because when she asks me to babysit for her I almost always refuse. The thing is that Pablo is not well behaved, he has ADHD and I know it's because of that, but he's too difficult for me to handle. Also she is a SAHM, she doesn't need my help as much as Leo, who's a single parent, needs. She thinks I'm showing favoritism towards Leo and his son.

Have you baby sat him before and it didn't go well?", "NTA. I understand why your daughter is upset, these dynamics would probably upset me personally in the moment as well. I say NTA though because you aren't obligated to watch any of your grandkids. I also understand feeling like you can't handle your grandson, whether he has ADHD or not. Honestly, for you and your grandson if you aren't comfortable with him alone then it's not the best situation for either of you.  Even paid staff have the right to turn down assignments. \n\nI would also add, it's not fair to assume because your daughter is a stay at home mom, she doesn't need help. She definitely does, especially if her kid is as you describe. Do you have opportunities to spend time with your daughters children in other ways? Do you have opportunities to learn more about your grandson's diagnosis?

Or offering a little financial assistance for a babysitter?", "Nta at all", "NTA - Your 2 children are in different situations, where your son needs the help and your daughter just wants it.  Your daughter is being petty by comparing the 2 situation like they are the same.\n\nChildren with ADHD can be out of control sometimes and it is understandable that you would not want to be responsible for children that act this way, it can be very stressful.  I am getting \"main character\" vibes from your daughter.  If she is assuming that if you can't handle watching them, that you don't love them, then that is being manipulative.", "Soft YTA - technically you don\u2019t owe anyone babysitting but it\u2019s not necessary nice to say \u2018he needs it more\u2019 \nas a SAHM myself, it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need help or time out/ away from children. \n\nBut I get the ADHD is difficult to handle but have you tried spending time with her to see how she handles it?", "Soft YTA - SAHMs need time to breathe too, especially if they have a child who is more of a challenge.  \n\nBut if you physically or mentally cannot handle her child, that is completely and acceptable reason and you need to share that with her.", "NTA\n\nBeing a SAHM doesn't automatically mean that she doesn't need help with her kids because she has other responsibilities and wants a break too. I understand why she feels hurt.\n\nThis is your time and you made a perfectly sound argument for helping Leo. He is a single father, needs more help, and his son is more behaved. Florence has her husband to help her out, and her son is more difficult to handle.", "Soft YTA. Mostly because of this comment:\n\n>she is a SAHM, she doesn't need my help as much as Leo,\n\nIt's not because she's a sahm that she doesn't need help. She has other chores around the house than just her kids. Plus she also needs a breather from time to time. That comment was very very mean and unnecessary. Being a sahm is not easy!\n\nI get that Pablo might be harder to handle. Have you tried asking your daughter how she manages him and then using those same methods with him? Also, what do you mean when you say he's not behaved? Because that can mean a lot of things and it feels like you're saying he's not well behaved for his adhd traits.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your time to use how you want.\n\nI would say though - being a SAHM doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t need a break, or that her job isn\u2019t hard. And if you go hardline on this with her there may be consequences about how she and your grandkids feel in their relationship with you.\n\nSo it\u2019s up to you whether that is worth it.", "NTA. But your daughter is.", "NTA you said you can't handle the other child and it's a danger to have someone watch your kid that just can't keep up.", "YTA, Leo only has his kid half the time. Just from this alone, he needs you 50% less of the time than your daughter does. Not to even that she has 2 kids while he only has 1. \n\nWhile a divorce is emotionally taxing, it doesn't actually increase the need for childcare in this case. If Leo was a single, working parent with full custody, I would think differently.\n\nMeanwhile, you are completely disregarding your daughter's need to have free time. It doesn't even sound like the ADHD kid is that difficult; I've had neurotypical kids in my family that act like that, they're just more energetic, and it takes a more engaged caretaker to deal with it. But nothing beyond a little extra energy, you don't have to manage meds or meltdowns or anything like that it seems, from your comments about his behavior. \n\nTbh, it sounds like you are playing favorites with the grandkids, not just with your kids. You seem to care more about your son's feelings than your daughter's. And you seem to prefer your calmer grandchildren to your more high energy one. That really sucks. \n\nYou might not owe your daughter free babysitting, but you should find some way to validate her feelings and give her some relief. Can you maybe go over there while she is home, and play with the grandkids so she can have a cup of coffee or a long shower or something? That way you're not alone with the kids, but you're still helping. Or even, just coming over with a packed lunch, that would take a chore off her plate and give her some adult conversation. Literally anything a couple times a month to show that you care. \n\nThis approach would also have the added benefit of improving your relationship with your daughter's kids. If you visit Leo's kid regularly, but not the other two, they may start to feel less loved by you. Kids don't care whether you are babysitting or visiting, they only register that you are there, or not there. Simply being there will help a lot.", "I mean, yeah. You're kind of TA here. I have been a working single parent and a SAHP before. SAHP need sitters too. Sometimes for sanity and sometimes just to go to the doctor or run an errand that would be enormously complicated by children. It kind of sounds like you do favor the non disabled grandchild be size you say that you prefer to sit for kids that don't have ADD. Kids with ADD aren't completely unmanageable, they require different strategies that maybe you could put in a little effort to learn. You should probably figure out a way to make this work a couple times a month.", "NAH - you have the right to refuse and babysit who you want, you already had your kids and did your job, but I also could understand why your daughter feels bad.", "As the adhd kid that was \u201ctoo hard to handle\u201d (most people were just ignorant and didn\u2019t even try) this breaks my heart. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone babysitting, but essentially leaving a child out because of a disability they can\u2019t control is a very hurtful thing to do. Most adhd kids just need some routine, some space, and an outlet for their energy. If you can\u2019t handle it, that\u2019s all fine, but you can\u2019t expect the kid and their parents to be happy about it. You\u2019re building connections with every other kid, and openly talking about how you can\u2019t be around one specific kid. \n\nAlso the idea that stay at home parents need less help is ridiculous. If anything they need *more* help because they literally never get a break. \n\nI\u2019m going with YTA. I hope you try to learn how to care for this child. I vividly remember being rejected by family members because I was just too much. It still hurts and I\u2019m a grown ass woman now. That sting never really goes away. Just be aware that that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing to that kid.

I'M ADHD and mom always talks about how I was very difficult as a child (I know, not great, whole other problems, not relevant) but she says it was easier when I was medicated. I'd say talk to her about getting him some help/meds for it. If she refuses then definitely NTA", "NTA there is a big difference here. Your son needs help to be able to have the custody arrangement he has. Plus he is newly divorced and learning. He isn\u2019t asking you to watch his child so he can have a break.\n\nSecond kids with adhd are a lot to handle if you do not know how to. This is a big ask with a lot of reasons why you shouldn\u2019t:\n\n1- kids with adhd have to have routine. A babysitter even if it\u2019s the grandma is going to miss up that routine. Which in turn will make the behavioral issues worse.\n\n2- if you do not know how to deal with his behavior problems and be come frustrated then again he will feed off that energy and make the problems worse.\n\nI feel sorry for your daughter. Her life is hard however having a child there are many sacrifices. Having a child with different needs  and behavioral issues you make even more sacrifices including not get the babysitting help others get.", "YTA your daughter is asking for help because she does need it. \nIf Leo has shared custody he gets time to shower and eat in peace at least a couple nights a week. If Florence is the STAHP she\u2019s probably also the default parent which means any time alone is probably difficult while the children are home.", "YTA.\n\nSeriously? So because she\u2019s a stay at home mom that means she doesn\u2019t need help? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. I\u2019m a SAHM with 2 kids (1 with ADHD) with no family or support near by and I NEVER get brakes. Being a SAHM/D is every bit of a job plus some because you don\u2019t get breakes, no lunch breaks, no bathroom breaks, you\u2019re on the clock, 24/7, you\u2019re on the job as soon as your eyes open in the morning until your head hits the pillow at night and even then you\u2019re on Night Shift because kids sometimes don\u2019t stay asleep. Then you mentioned that one of her kids has ADHD, which is a whole other level to parenting, you say you can\u2019t even handle it for a few hours imagine what she has to deal with on a daily basis. When you are not dealing with kids, you\u2019re dealing with house chores, paying bills, chauffeur kids around, meal planning, prep, and clean up, managing everyone\u2019s appointments, and so so much more. It doesn\u2019t sound like she asked for childcare very often, and while you certainly are not obligated to babysit anyones Children, it does seem very selfish that you were only willing to look after one of your grandkids. If my parents only watched my brothers kids and refuse to watch mine, I would be absolutely devastated and completely feel like you were playing favoritism. At the end of the day, I don\u2019t know your full story, maybe you really can\u2019t handle him for a few hours, but it seems less like you can\u2019t handle him and more like you just don\u2019t want to.. but I can definitely see where your daughter feels hurt.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't owe babysitting chores to anyone, and you can parcel your involvement in it as you see fit.\n\nIf you don't want to babysit in house A but do want to in house B, that is your right.\n\nYou don't owe these people anything.

Florence sounds entitled.", "NTA - Tell her that if she gets a job, you\u2019ll babysit a couple of hours every other week too.", "[removed]", "I don't think she assumes her daughter needs no help bc she's a SAHM. She said she needs less help because she's a SAHM, vs her single son who is likely working full time.

Leo is alone, she has her husband, Leo needs my help but she doesn't really need it. If it's an emergency then I'll babysit for her, Leo's case is an emergency too and that's why I'm helping him too", "I was a SAHM too, then I got divorced and had to start working. Finding someone to take care of your kid's while you're at work is far more stressful than staying home and caring for them yourself. Plus she has her husband to help with their kids, Leo is a single parent, all the childcare relies on him alone. I don't think those scenarios are the same at all.", "I agree.  She absolutely should go NC.  If Florence wants to hold her kid as a bargaining chip because she doesn't get free babysitting then she should do that.  As if everyone in life is going to fall over themselves to spend time with a difficult to manage child.  LOL.", "That makes total sense. I wonder if there is another way you could help her feel supported. Offer to pay for a sitter once a month, to help find a babysitter that is a good fit, to go over to the house for a couple hours a week to give her an extra set of hands or a break but not be alone with the kids, etc.", "[removed]", "You clearly have a golden grandchild though, don\u2019t you? I don\u2019t think anybody is in any obligation to babysit but it does look like favoritism, even if not your children but to your grandchildren and they\u2019re going to notice. Do you go out of your way to have any relationship/bond with Pablo?", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for not babysitting. But calling him badly behaved for behaviors out of his control at this age especially when the behaviors sound like fairly common kid problems probably really hurts your daughter. It\u2019s ok to say  you\u2019re not equipped to manage his behaviors/symptoms, but your word choice could definitely be considered hurtful.\n\nI think your daughter might be more upset about your attitude towards her and her son than you not babysitting. Based on how you write about him I feel it\u2019s likely you have said some mildly insensitive things towards her son, though hopefully not intentional.\n\nHave you done research into adhd and how it presents in kids his age? Have you researched or talked to your daughter about techniques that work with him? I\u2019m not saying you need to educate yourself because you are obligated to babysit for them, but because if you do not put in effort to know her son and understand him and how his brain works differently then your daughter is right. If you don\u2019t put in effort to understand her son but have time to watch your other grandson so often then you are favoring one child.\n\nYou also need to learn how to be more sensitive with your language when you talk about him to others, even when you\u2019re not talking directly to the child because there\u2019s always a chance he could hear more than you think, understand more than you think, and internalize the idea (even if it\u2019s not true) that you think he\u2019s somehow less than his neurotypical cousins.\n\nAlso it\u2019s an asshole move to say your daughter doesn\u2019t need a break since she\u2019s a stay at home mom. If you truly think her children are so difficult then doesn\u2019t logic lead to the fact that she might need a break? Or not even a break but help if she needs to go to the doctor or the dentist or something similar? Again not saying it\u2019s you who\u2019s obligated to do so, but your daughter is also deserving of help and support.\n\nYour daughter is telling you she feels less loved and valued than her brother and that you love your other grandchild more. I don\u2019t think that type of feeling comes from just not babysitting, it sounds like a culmination of a lot of small resentments. But even if it\u2019s just because of babysitting, are you comfortable with the fact that your daughter believes you don\u2019t love her as much? Regardless of who is right in this situation I don\u2019t understand why you are more concerned about being right than you are about your daughter feeling less loved. Even if you say it\u2019s not true that you love your daughter less, your daughter still feels that way. Have you asked her if there are other reasons she feels this way besides babysitting? Has she ever expressed feeling this way before? Again not saying you have to babysit. But I really think you\u2019re missing the issue. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for not babysitting.

Instead of trying to create a less stressful environment for OP to spend time with grandchild, Florence has simply demanded free babysitting.  \n\nHow do you think that's going to go when the child is difficult to watch, do you think being guilted into watching a child who is difficult is going to make OP like the child more or less?  \n\nThere is no evidence that OP mistreats the child.  \n\nBut hey, if Florence wants to hold her difficult to manage child as a bargaining chip because she isn't getting free babysitting.....so be it.

I had more issues in my life related to my ADHD than i ever had from my parents being separated before my mom died. \n\nMore importantly though, this is not about the kid. This is about OP treating her children differently. She is helping one and not helping the other. I never called OP TA and actually said i wasn't passing judgments. \n\nMaybe take a second to  step back form you bully pulpit and realize none of this is the kids fault (siblings or grandkids). OP made the conscious decision to not watch her daughter's son. She may have a reason but clearly she believes she can't handle him.
