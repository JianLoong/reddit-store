Her daughter, SIL and grandchild were coming to town for the weekend. We got to talking in the parking lot after work and I suggested everyone come to my house for BLTs the next day. It is worth noting in our planning conversation I said we really needed to get rid of a bunch of stuff in our fridge because it needed to be eaten before it goes bad and settled on BLTs since we had most everything and they love them. MIL asks if she needs to bring anything. We went over all the ingredients and I specifically said we have a full loaf of bread, a head of lettuce, bacon, Mayo. The only thing I didn\u2019t have were tomatoes because I don\u2019t like them and they grow them. We confirm the time and reiterated that she only need to bring the tomatoes. Husbands family is notoriously 15 minutes early. When they were 15 minutes late, I asked my husband to call them to make sure we had the right time. I wanted to make sure everything was hot and ready to go. MIL said she was running late because she was still cooking bacon. I was angry and told him they only needed to bring tomatoes and that I already made bacon, MIL said you can never have too much bacon. I tried to keep my cool, and continued getting the toast ready to pop in the oven. An hour later, husbands family shows up with 5 grocery bags full of everything you could possibly need, Mayo, miracle whip, two more heads of lettuce, two loaves of bread, two packages of cooked bacon\u2026.and three un-sliced tomatoes. Unsliced is no big deal but if it was the only thing you were supposed to bring, I mean it wouldn\u2019t have hurt. I was beyond upset. My favorite thing in the world is hosting and I had everything prepared and displayed nicely. I not only spent a few hours setting everything up but also making gourmet sauces and sides. I had to spend the additional hour they were late keeping everything warm/cold as needed. When they marched into my kitchen and set all the bags down I uncontrollably start crying say how rude it was to bring the meal I just made. You would never bring a cooked turkey to thanksgiving if the host wasn\u2019t expecting it, it\u2019s rude. I went to our shed and cried, my husband came out 20 minutes later and asked if I would back inside an apologized to my MIL for making her feel bad. I said that is ridiculous and she was in the wrong. I eventually came back inside made a strawberry and provolone grilled cheese, because I don\u2019t even like BLTs (they are a favorite of his family) and ate in my room. I refuse to apologize and my husband is on my MIL\u2019s side. We refer to it as BLT-gate and I am resentful of him for not having a conversation with his mom about how inappropriate it was. BTW there is no way his mother misunderstood or forgot the details of our planning conversation. AITA?\n\nEdit to clarify and answer some questions. \nI was crying because they were an hour late making a lunch we agreed I would prepare. I thought it was more appropriate to not cry in front of everyone which is why I went to the shed. Only 4 people were eating the BLTs, the niece only eats Mac and cheese so I made that and I do not eat bacon so I planned a different sandwich and had extra add-ons everyone would enjoy. I put a lot of effort in trying to make lunch special. Would I be justified if it wasn\u2019t a simple BLT? If it was cordon bleu or lasagna would it make a difference?", "created_utc": 1668479418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvkb4f/aita_for_storming_out_on_my_inlaws_after_mil_show/", "score": 1386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of fighting or making a scene, I just thank her and shove it in the fridge. If she asks I just say we already have plenty of food.

I said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll put them in Tupperware and give it to them before they leave.\u201d Her face was priceless!", "So, this really isn't about a BLT. The tears were a temporary loss of control because your in-laws are so focused on outdoing your contributions and outperforming your efforts, that you feel like you either have to exist in a constant state of competition with them, or give up your own feelings and personal needs, so they can always hold the spotlight. That's a really frustrating position to be in. \n\nWhen things are calmer, I suggest you explain that to your husband, so he can better understand where you are coming from. I would also suggest that you either discuss your feelings with your in-laws, or refuse to compete with them. Allowing your feelings to get the better of you only feeds their need to hold the spotlight. Your mother-in-law went from hero to martyr, and both positions fulfill her need for attention. \n\nIf you choose to discuss your feelings with your in-laws, I would open with an apology of sorts. \"I'm sorry I allowed my feelings to get the better of me. I don't want that to happen again, so I thought it would be best if I could explain the source of my reaction, and how I think we can avoid these kinds of \"miscommunications\" in the future.\" You aren't apologizing for being upset. You are basically apologizing for letting them run you over, but they should be happy with that apology, and you can feel at peace knowing what you really meant. Then you need to establish boundaries for these types of situations. Maybe something like, \"I really love entertaining, so, in the future, I would prefer to provide the meal when I am having guests in my home.\" Just make sure you don't discuss the menu with them. Perhaps tell them it's \"a surprise\", so they can come over and \"sit back and relax\" while you do all the work.\n\nIf you decide to avoid discussing the problem. Don't allow yourself to be forced into a competition with them. If they bring over the same ingredients: take the tomatoes, slice them, and put them out with the rest of the food. Comment how wonderful they taste and smell. Then let them know that you appreciate them bringing over the extra food, but you already have everything you need. \"Thank you for bringing that, Patricia. You can set it on the back counter. I've already got all the food done and ready to go, but it's nice to have extra in case we run out.\" Then smile and shoo them out of the kitchen letting everyone present know it's time to eat. If you need more, you're all set. If not, ask them if they'd like to take it back home, and pack it up and hand it to them on their way out the door.\n\nETA: Also, don't hold the meal for them again. Let them know the time and maybe wait 10 minutes past it. If they don't show up, keep spme food warm in the oven for them and serve everyone else. Do that enough times and they'll learn to be on time.", "This.  Sounds like death by a thousand paper cuts.", "Most likely, hence why I say they have *all* been involved in making this drama. \n\nAnd that sucks if MIL is subtly or not so subtly insulting OP when she hosts.\n\nBut to me the takeaway is... they can't win if you don't play. It's just sandwiches. If your MIL is trying to one up you on having people over for a BLT then she's already losing. The only way you can lose is to think this minor thing is as important as she does, which it isn't.", "Would it help to know that when we told my MIL we were struggling with fertility the next words out of her mouth were that her neighbors just had a baby and are expecting another (Irish twins) in June?", "Too much of anything can hurt you. I guess everyone forgets about the nurse who died drinking water trying to win her kids a Nintendo Wii.\n\nEdit: this sub has so many douches in it.", "Possibly, can't really tell. Maybe she was just worried there wouldn't be enough food or that the \"old\" food might have gone bad. It was rude but maybe not malicious.", "Did you tell them before they got to your house that you had prepared all of this?

When they arrive with 5 grocery bags of food, thank them profusely as if they just saved the day and say how grateful you are that they totally ignored the plan because, obviously, it would never have worked out, and immediately hand the entire responsibility for the meal over to the offending relative(s). From that moment on, do nothing without their explicit approval and make no helpful suggestions. Smiling brightly say, \"MIL, what can I do to help?\" She may say to unload the grocery bags. Do so, but don't put anything away. Just leave everything on the counter. Remember, this is not your circus and not your monkeys.

If she says \"What foods have you already prepared?\" Just laugh in an embarrassed way and say, \"It doesn't really matter now that you're here and have everything under control. Let's just start from scratch so you can make sure it's done right.\" MIL will probably want some of the food you prepared but make her review every last item while you say, \"Are you *sure*? Are you *totally* sure? I'd be more than happy to put it in the refigerator so you can make a new one just the way you like it. I'll have it put away in a jiffy and my family can have it as leftovers tomorrow. It's no problem at all.\" Whisk the food item to the refrigerator while saying, \"Out of sight, out of mind!\" Then say, \"I'll help you make a new one the way you like it, if you want me to. However, your cooking skills are so much better than mine, I'm not sure I'll be much help.\" Rinse, repeat for each item you prepared. Keep saying, \"I'm afraid I'm being no help whatso*ever*\". Then say, \"While you're doing that, I'll just go make sure everyone has something to drink and I'd better check on what the kids/dog/cat are up to\". Then pour yourself a glass of wine and go put your feet up. Wait until you are called to the table to eat.\n\nEventually, someone, like your husband, may actually start to question why you are fixing meals that are instantly turned into leftovers without ever being served. Or why his mom does all the cooking whenever she is invited over for a meal. \n\nMIL may eventually decide to stop showing up with grocery bags of food so she won't be put in charge of cooking. Or she may enjoy cooking. If she likes doing the cooking, stop preparing any food when you invite them over for a meal.

As they are all from eastern Europe, they are used to bringing food, so they all turned up with various dishes they had prepared, which they then claimed were starters.  Three hours in and they had finished the \"starters\", nobody was hungry and the roast was cold.  They did this twice before I had a bit of rant to my wife about the wasted food and effort.  So, the last time, they did actually not bring food.

One load of bread might make 7 sandwiches, barely, if you use the heels.  No seconds.  One pound of bacon might supply 14 slices of bacon, maybe.  Maybe not.  I like at least three slices of bacon on a BLT, and four is better.  One pound of bacon would make 7 skimpy sandwiches.  \n\nMaybe MIL did the math and thought the same thing.
