{"id": 2349, "submission_id": "yvkb4f", "title": "AITA for storming out on my in-laws after MIL show up an hour late and bring the exact meal I just cooked?", "selftext": "I (34F) work with my MIL. Her daughter, SIL and grandchild were coming to town for the weekend. We got to talking in the parking lot after work and I suggested everyone come to my house for BLTs the next day. It is worth noting in our planning conversation I said we really needed to get rid of a bunch of stuff in our fridge because it needed to be eaten before it goes bad and settled on BLTs since we had most everything and they love them. MIL asks if she needs to bring anything. We went over all the ingredients and I specifically said we have a full loaf of bread, a head of lettuce, bacon, Mayo. The only thing I didn\u2019t have were tomatoes because I don\u2019t like them and they grow them. We confirm the time and reiterated that she only need to bring the tomatoes. Husbands family is notoriously 15 minutes early. When they were 15 minutes late, I asked my husband to call them to make sure we had the right time. I wanted to make sure everything was hot and ready to go. MIL said she was running late because she was still cooking bacon. I was angry and told him they only needed to bring tomatoes and that I already made bacon, MIL said you can never have too much bacon. I tried to keep my cool, and continued getting the toast ready to pop in the oven. An hour later, husbands family shows up with 5 grocery bags full of everything you could possibly need, Mayo, miracle whip, two more heads of lettuce, two loaves of bread, two packages of cooked bacon\u2026.and three un-sliced tomatoes. Unsliced is no big deal but if it was the only thing you were supposed to bring, I mean it wouldn\u2019t have hurt. I was beyond upset. My favorite thing in the world is hosting and I had everything prepared and displayed nicely. I not only spent a few hours setting everything up but also making gourmet sauces and sides. I had to spend the additional hour they were late keeping everything warm/cold as needed. When they marched into my kitchen and set all the bags down I uncontrollably start crying say how rude it was to bring the meal I just made. You would never bring a cooked turkey to thanksgiving if the host wasn\u2019t expecting it, it\u2019s rude. I went to our shed and cried, my husband came out 20 minutes later and asked if I would back inside an apologized to my MIL for making her feel bad. I said that is ridiculous and she was in the wrong. I eventually came back inside made a strawberry and provolone grilled cheese, because I don\u2019t even like BLTs (they are a favorite of his family) and ate in my room. I refuse to apologize and my husband is on my MIL\u2019s side. We refer to it as BLT-gate and I am resentful of him for not having a conversation with his mom about how inappropriate it was. BTW there is no way his mother misunderstood or forgot the details of our planning conversation. AITA?\n\nEdit to clarify and answer some questions. \nI was crying because they were an hour late making a lunch we agreed I would prepare. I thought it was more appropriate to not cry in front of everyone which is why I went to the shed. Only 4 people were eating the BLTs, the niece only eats Mac and cheese so I made that and I do not eat bacon so I planned a different sandwich and had extra add-ons everyone would enjoy. I put a lot of effort in trying to make lunch special. Would I be justified if it wasn\u2019t a simple BLT? If it was cordon bleu or lasagna would it make a difference?", "created_utc": 1668479418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvkb4f/aita_for_storming_out_on_my_inlaws_after_mil_show/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I also know about MILs who try to embarrass their DILs. \n\nMy MIL pulls this kinda shit when I\u2019m cooking an elaborate meal. Instead of fighting or making a scene, I just thank her and shove it in the fridge. If she asks I just say we already have plenty of food.

I said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll put them in Tupperware and give it to them before they leave.\u201d Her face was priceless!", "So, this really isn't about a BLT. The tears were a temporary loss of control because your in-laws are so focused on outdoing your contributions and outperforming your efforts, that you feel like you either have to exist in a constant state of competition with them, or give up your own feelings and personal needs, so they can always hold the spotlight. That's a really frustrating position to be in. \n\nWhen things are calmer, I suggest you explain that to your husband, so he can better understand where you are coming from. I would also suggest that you either discuss your feelings with your in-laws, or refuse to compete with them. Allowing your feelings to get the better of you only feeds their need to hold the spotlight. Your mother-in-law went from hero to martyr, and both positions fulfill her need for attention. \n\nIf you choose to discuss your feelings with your in-laws, I would open with an apology of sorts. \"I'm sorry I allowed my feelings to get the better of me. I don't want that to happen again, so I thought it would be best if I could explain the source of my reaction, and how I think we can avoid these kinds of \"miscommunications\" in the future.\" You aren't apologizing for being upset. You are basically apologizing for letting them run you over, but they should be happy with that apology, and you can feel at peace knowing what you really meant. Then you need to establish boundaries for these types of situations. Maybe something like, \"I really love entertaining, so, in the future, I would prefer to provide the meal when I am having guests in my home.\" Just make sure you don't discuss the menu with them. Perhaps tell them it's \"a surprise\", so they can come over and \"sit back and relax\" while you do all the work.\n\nIf you decide to avoid discussing the problem. Don't allow yourself to be forced into a competition with them. If they bring over the same ingredients: take the tomatoes, slice them, and put them out with the rest of the food. Comment how wonderful they taste and smell. Then let them know that you appreciate them bringing over the extra food, but you already have everything you need. \"Thank you for bringing that, Patricia. You can set it on the back counter. I've already got all the food done and ready to go, but it's nice to have extra in case we run out.\" Then smile and shoo them out of the kitchen letting everyone present know it's time to eat. If you need more, you're all set. If not, ask them if they'd like to take it back home, and pack it up and hand it to them on their way out the door.\n\nETA: Also, don't hold the meal for them again. Let them know the time and maybe wait 10 minutes past it. If they don't show up, keep spme food warm in the oven for them and serve everyone else. Do that enough times and they'll learn to be on time.", "This.  Sounds like death by a thousand paper cuts.", "Most likely, hence why I say they have *all* been involved in making this drama. \n\nAnd that sucks if MIL is subtly or not so subtly insulting OP when she hosts.\n\nBut to me the takeaway is... they can't win if you don't play. It's just sandwiches. If your MIL is trying to one up you on having people over for a BLT then she's already losing. The only way you can lose is to think this minor thing is as important as she does, which it isn't.", "Would it help to know that when we told my MIL we were struggling with fertility the next words out of her mouth were that her neighbors just had a baby and are expecting another (Irish twins) in June?", "Too much of anything can hurt you. I guess everyone forgets about the nurse who died drinking water trying to win her kids a Nintendo Wii.\n\nEdit: this sub has so many douches in it.", "Possibly, can't really tell. Maybe she was just worried there wouldn't be enough food or that the \"old\" food might have gone bad. It was rude but maybe not malicious.", "Did you tell them before they got to your house that you had prepared all of this? Because if all they knew was that you were serving them BLT leftovers that were about to go bad in your fridge, I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t blame them for being horrified and bringing their own food.", "Yea but if nothing been done about anything then a tiny thing could set you off. I have a feeling this what it is. Op holding it in on other things so this one tiny thing she can\u2019t this time.", "And there it is\u2026 this is not about the Iranian yogurt, you\u2019re upset because you feel like your MIL thinks you have no value to her if you cannot produce grand babies. Listen, you have value. You are important. You are worthy of love and respect. Being able to have children, or not being able to have children, is not what defines your worth. I wish you and your husband health, wealth, and much luck in your continued attempts to have the family you choose to have. That said, if you cannot have children then that is also OK.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking, if someone said oh I\u2019ll cook and I\u2019m only making this because I need to use it before it goes bad then my first thought would be how long has it been there? Then are you only offering to get rid of nearly off food? How do I know how much of it you actually have? Also what if the food went off overnight? I\u2019d definitely be bringing supplies that we can all use instead of risking eating off meat", "I am known for my cooking and serving up some bougie meals, the comment about needing to eat the food we have in the fridge before it goes bad wasn\u2019t really a factor in this. She knew we would never serve bad food. It was more trying to say, no really I already have everything, can we please eat the food I have already bought."]}
