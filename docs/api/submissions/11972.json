These cars were half on the pavement with barely enough room to push my pram and definitely not enough room for a wheelchair, for example. Now I was pushing my pram and it was a squeeze between me and the cars but the last car I got stuck and rammed my pram through the gap (couldn\u2019t of been too hard because baby was still asleep after). \n\nNext thing I know I hear \u201coi\u201d so I turned around and this guy must\u2019ve come out of the house and shouted to me that I scratched his car. I walked back and said where (he pointed out some scuffs along his wheel arch) I said well you shouldn\u2019t be parked on the pavement it\u2019s illegal and there must be enough room for wheelchairs, prams ect. He started shouting really aggressively telling me I should pay for the scratches. I said he can\u2019t expect me to push my baby into a busy road because he wants to park on a FOOTpath with emphasis on the foot part. I refused to be shouted at in front of my son so I called him an arsehole and walked off. \n\nI do feel bad for scratching his car. It was a \u201822 plate Kia, I\u2019m assuming brand new. It wasn\u2019t intentional at all, but still, dont park on the pavement! \n\nAnyway I got home and my partner said I could\u2019ve knocked on and asked him to move the car. And although he said he wouldn\u2019t of got aggressive he understand why he\u2019s annoyed his car got damaged?! \n\nSo AITA for scratching this car and refusing to give details to pay for it?

She also had her child with her, god forbid she walks where shes supposed to.", "Should be legal, probably the only deterrent that will stop arsehole drivers", "If it was intentional? Then sure, it shouldn\u2019t happen. This didn\u2019t happen intentionally though. She clearly explains how she shaved against the car on accident and even apologized to the man who owned the car.", "I hear ya, I had to petition the council to put in 5 between me and the train station because they had some without a way of getting back up on the other side!", "Yeah it's the UK, insurance would laugh their arse off if anyone tried that. It's hard enough to get a claim paid for when a car hits your parked car, especially without witnesses. Insurance in the UK would  tell the person they'd need to claim on their own insurance and park more carefully next time.", "It may be worth noting that this didn't take place in America so your argument about being legally liable for damages might not be relevent", "Could've turned around and went back the way they came from. They are an asshole.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. If scratching someone else\u2019s car was ok, there would be some kind of law that says it\u2019s appropriate punishment for parking on the footpath.", "Fair point. Then why not turn around? Again, different solutions were there and OP picked the wrong one. I get it. Illegally parked. But also ruining a car? Not right.", "\u201cSafety of a car\u201d. This is just cosmetic shit", "Being an idiot knows no nationality", "that depends. the police can charge you with 'unecessary obstruction of the highway' all over the country. local councils can also make orders making it illegal.", "Parking in such a way as to obstruct passage for pavement users including people with prams or wheelchair users is illegal.", "It's not illegal but you are not allowed to obstruct people", "And... Go somewhere other than home? What's your long term plan here?\n\nAs a wheelchair user my routes are limited and turning around isn't often an option.", "I didn\u2019t say she keyed it. I was giving another example of property damaged. It is not an accident when you push your metal item through a tight space with a car on one side. It will obv scratch it like come on. It wasn\u2019t an \u201coops\u201d she could have stopped the first second the noise was made.", "Just a lil tip for next time, if you press \u2018=\u2018 long enoufh you eventually get \u2018\u2260\u2019!!!", "I can\u2019t speak for OP but pushing through a too tight area with a metal based pram and a vehicle seems pretty intentional.", "Done that... They don't have the funding. Apparently spending too much on it on councillors' partners' \"charities\" etc.", "Must not vs should not. \n\nIllegal in London, usually ill-advised everywhere else but not illegal.", "Even when the owner of the car saw the person do it? Like what if they have ring camera footage of the OP ramming the stroller into the car?", "Lmfao at this pathetic car-brain", "Why is everyone missing the option that should literally walk back to her house the way she came instead of whatever loop she normally takes. Obviously dude is an asshole for parking like an asshole but OP was really petty. Who damages a stranger car with something that contains their baby?? She reminds me of this AITA OP from a while back that thought she was extremely badass for breaking her in laws sliding glass door when she got scared from a prank. She wasn\u2019t in the wrong at all but kept acting like she\u2019d done such brilliant thing and it was the best option. Scratching an assholes car with your baby carriage is not the right move OP", "Thank you! This comment section is the most brain dead AITA responses I\u2019ve seen in quite some time", "How much of a detour is OP supposed to take? What if the next shortest route also gas a car parked on the sidewalk? How much life is a pedestrian supposed to waste to accommodate machines that egocentric people left in their rightful way?", "Safety of a paint job maybe XD", "\u2260\n\nOmg lifechanging!!!", "Maybe she thought it\u2019d fit?? I\u2019ve had this happen a numerous amount of times while trying to get my bike out of the shed and squeezing past the cars on our driveway. It usually works but sometimes I\u2019m like \u2018Ah no didn\u2019t see it well enough\u2019", "Just looking out of my window at all the cars parked on the curb. I and everyone I know have parked on the curb for years, never received a ticket. I've seen police cars parked on the curb. On a lot of roads you HAVE to park that way as the roads aren't wide enough for cars to park on the road without blocking traffic. It's just a fact. It's also a fact that op damaged someone's property and refused to pay for it which is pretty illegal too.", "I\u2019d say parking like shit can be an accident more so than intentionally forcing your stroller against a car hard enough to leave scratches", "Again I get it. But this clearly was a one time thing. It\u2019s not a constant. We\u2019re evaluating a one time occurrence. Can\u2019t predict the future. That\u2019s why I said soft YTA. There were other solutions. As they say, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. I think OP took the wrong approach. That\u2019s all.", "I\u2019d start threatening the AH\u2019s safety", "Where do you think she was going? Just out on her jollies? People have specific destinations.", "Did you stop or scratch it prob the length of the car?", "is this still relating to the post? the owner of the car seemingly saw it happen.. when would she have left a note when he confronted her immediately after it happened", "Again, underestimating the size of the footpath. You know when you've done it. If you leave the car there, it is intentional. It is against the law. Property isn't more valuable than people. Scratches on a car are less interesting to the police and insurance than forcing pushchairs and wheelchairs into traffic.", "No, she intentionally walked on the footpath, where she is legally supposed to walk. She didn't set out to hurt the car.", "Oh I'm pretty sure the guy parks like that a lot of times!\n\n\nWhat makes you think it was a one time occurance? There were probably countless other times where OP fit just through or there just wasn't anyone to complain.", "I just assumed she was out for a walk. I live in a U.S. suburb and drive everywhere. Walking with a destination didn\u2019t cross my mind\u2026 that\u2019s why I asked!  Like if you\u2019re just out for exercise it doesn\u2019t matter where you walk. Just go the other way and avoid possible damage to your pram and confrontation.", "she stated she was just on a walk with dog and baby with no set destination so no it doesnt matter. a walk is a walk i dont think the 5 month old cares which direction its in", "Yes! Where I\u2019m from we don\u2019t walk to get places. We drive!! Everywhere!! Walking outside is only for exercise. So from my standpoint she could turn around and walk anywhere else besides where there is a car in her way", "If she set out to or not, it was still intentional.", "people in the UK often walk to get places", "Maybe - just maybe - things are different in other places.", "If she set out to or not? As in if it was intentional or not, it was still intentional? Are you quite well? If she didn't set out to do it it wasn't intentional. Therefore...it wasn't intentional.", "Whereas people here, like me, walk miles and miles on a treadmill and then drive the mile to the bar. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Or maybe- just maybe- she was just out on her jollies. in which case maybe- just maybe- she could have just turned around", "Set out to - premeditated \n\nDidn't set out to - not planned, but she still was annoyed and damaged his vehicle.\n\nThanks for checking on me, I appreciate you! \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude17", "honestly when my family moved to the USA in the 00s one of the biggest culture shocks was just, not being able to walk places? my parents still complain about the time they got ticketed because they parked in a grocery store lot, went to the grocery store, and then went to a couple of other shops in the area on foot instead of driving to each shop in turn. this was in LA, which I now know is especially bad for this kind of thing, but still lol", "Why should she? Why do you genuinely believe the car has more right to the pavement than the people it's actually for??"]}
