These cars were half on the pavement with barely enough room to push my pram and definitely not enough room for a wheelchair, for example. Now I was pushing my pram and it was a squeeze between me and the cars but the last car I got stuck and rammed my pram through the gap (couldn\u2019t of been too hard because baby was still asleep after). \n\nNext thing I know I hear \u201coi\u201d so I turned around and this guy must\u2019ve come out of the house and shouted to me that I scratched his car. I walked back and said where (he pointed out some scuffs along his wheel arch) I said well you shouldn\u2019t be parked on the pavement it\u2019s illegal and there must be enough room for wheelchairs, prams ect. He started shouting really aggressively telling me I should pay for the scratches. I said he can\u2019t expect me to push my baby into a busy road because he wants to park on a FOOTpath with emphasis on the foot part. I refused to be shouted at in front of my son so I called him an arsehole and walked off. \n\nI do feel bad for scratching his car. It was a \u201822 plate Kia, I\u2019m assuming brand new. It wasn\u2019t intentional at all, but still, dont park on the pavement! \n\nAnyway I got home and my partner said I could\u2019ve knocked on and asked him to move the car. And although he said he wouldn\u2019t of got aggressive he understand why he\u2019s annoyed his car got damaged?! \n\nSo AITA for scratching this car and refusing to give details to pay for it?
