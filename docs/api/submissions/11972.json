These cars were half on the pavement with barely enough room to push my pram and definitely not enough room for a wheelchair, for example. Now I was pushing my pram and it was a squeeze between me and the cars but the last car I got stuck and rammed my pram through the gap (couldn\u2019t of been too hard because baby was still asleep after). \n\nNext thing I know I hear \u201coi\u201d so I turned around and this guy must\u2019ve come out of the house and shouted to me that I scratched his car. I walked back and said where (he pointed out some scuffs along his wheel arch) I said well you shouldn\u2019t be parked on the pavement it\u2019s illegal and there must be enough room for wheelchairs, prams ect. He started shouting really aggressively telling me I should pay for the scratches. I said he can\u2019t expect me to push my baby into a busy road because he wants to park on a FOOTpath with emphasis on the foot part. I refused to be shouted at in front of my son so I called him an arsehole and walked off. \n\nI do feel bad for scratching his car. It was a \u201822 plate Kia, I\u2019m assuming brand new. It wasn\u2019t intentional at all, but still, dont park on the pavement! \n\nAnyway I got home and my partner said I could\u2019ve knocked on and asked him to move the car. And although he said he wouldn\u2019t of got aggressive he understand why he\u2019s annoyed his car got damaged?! \n\nSo AITA for scratching this car and refusing to give details to pay for it?

And if the owner came out with a weapon in their hand would you still feel righteous in your decision? No one cares about the car, it was just a foolish decision. If there was a fire truck blocking the sidewalk would you just continue on your path & push through?", "Turn around and go the other way!!", "She didn't key it, she trued to get past, the poor parking meant the car was scratched accidentally.", "I think of it more like if a car is parked over the line or really close to the line in a parking lot. If you drive up and it looks like a close fit, you find another spot. You don't force your car in and drive away if you clip them. They parked like an AH, but you would also be an AH if you did that, right?", "You did nothing wrong.  \n\n\nThe Highway Code:  \n\n\nRule 244  \nYou MUST NOT park partially or wholly on the pavement in London, and should not do so elsewhere unless signs permit it.

If not, when you felt the pram getting stuck, why did you force it through instead of pulling back before you caused damage? Weren't you worried about damaging the pram? If it was impassable without doing damage and you are just out for a walk, why didn't you go back the way you came and just take a different route that day? ESH. He shouldn't have parked that way, but you shouldn't have caused damage. And when you do cause damage, even accidentally, you pay for the damage. If you hit a car in a parking lot, do you just leave? If someone is parked over the line in a parking lot, do you force your way into the next spot, and then drive away if you scratch their car?", "He's in the wrong for sure, but she had other options than walking in the road like knocking and asking them to move or going a different route. Should she have had to do either, no course not, he should never have been parked there! But he was, and I think out of the options, ramming right through was the more AH option. They both suck.", "I know if it was between walk into a busy road with my baby or scratch someone\u2019s car, I\u2019d be the AH and scratch a car.

You will see it on every single street except in areas wealthy enough for double driveways", "Where does it say to go get hit by a car?", "I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s also illegal to damage someone\u2019s property. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. If someone\u2019s doing something illegal and you want to do something about it, you call authorities. You don\u2019t take matters into your own hands.

It\u2019s not ideal and obv shouldn\u2019t be a daily thing or entirety of the walk but there\u2019s zero excuse for damaging someone\u2019s property.

Maybe he should park legally.", "I feel like you guys have no comprehension of the size of a British footpath and the speed of the two way traffic she'd be walking into.

That's our law and our culture.", "This is definitely a better example than mine lol it was just the first thing I thought of", "OP has stared more than once that going around would mean stepping into a busy road.", "Into two way busy road?", "> Maybe I am not understanding, but why didn't you push the bush back?\n\nIt could whip back and lash her or her baby.

I agree she shouldn't have had to alter her route but in OPs comments and posts she had to use a fair amount of force - I'm not faulting her for not thinking of it in the moment because we don't think like that, she also shouldn't have been shouted at because he was in the wrong.

Some idiot's car not getting scratched is more important than the wellbeing of actual humans?", "Not if the property was illegally in that place. The car was parked (literally) in a place where it legally shouldn't be. You don't need to pay for that, even if you go by insurance, the first question they would ask is \"where was the car parked?\" And if the answer is \"somewhere they shouldn't be\", you won't see a penny.
