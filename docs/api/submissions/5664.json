Your brother\u2019s kids aren\u2019t your responsibility. There\u2019s a lot to do around a 1-y.o. and a two months old baby. Your brother and his significant other should learn to deal with the consequences of their actions. They had children at a young age, so they no longer can attend parties as they did before they had children. They can\u2019t expect family members to always help them. Get your younger brother a pack of condoms, he needs it.", "NTA; what in the heck is wrong with your family? You are not responsible for your brother\u2019s decisions or your brothers children.", "NTA. And furthermore, you should call CPS to report your brother (the real asshole here) for neglecting his helpless children.", "NTA; you shouldn\u2019t think like that. You are 19 and on your own. Your brother is 18 and has 2 kids and parties?! You sound like you have your head on straight. Please be very careful around your family. To me it seems like they reinforce bad behavior. Best of luck.", "NTA. You are being scapegoated here. Ultimately, it's the parents' responsibility. They didn't need to go party. You are not obligated to watch their kids, especially if you are babysitting another young child. 3 really young kids?? That's exhausting for one babysitter. They should not have left if they could not find appropriate childcare and their friend was clearly not it.", "NTA. If your family was so upset, why didn\u2019t any of them offer to take the babies?\n\nAlso, your brother is an AH. Big time.", "Nta. Your brother is selfish and is responsible for arranging childcare. You were already minding a child", "NTA. You are not obligated to babysit anyone just because you\u2019re family. You already had your sister and 3 kids is a lot for anyone.\n\nYour brother and his GF are the AH, they shouldn\u2019t be leaving a 2 month old baby just to get drunk for a night, I understand needing a break but that\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nDon\u2019t let them make you feel guilty for setting boundaries, and if your family is so upset why didn\u2019t they offer to look after the kids for the night?", "NTA. He should've hired a babysitter or made other arrangements for his kids if he wanted a childfree night out. Babysitting a one month old infant and a 2 yr old on top of watching a 5 year old is exhausting and a ridiculous ask.\n\nYou should've asked all of those family members who were upset with you why they didn't just watch the kids since it's no big deal.", "NTA who goes to a Christmas party that ends at 12 the next day when they have a 2 month old and a 1 year old! You know what should have happened? Your brother should have been responsible, arranged for someone to watch the kids for a reasonable time had a drink but not gotten wrecked and come home via an uber at a reasonable time.", "NTA\n\nI think what they really meant was if your brother would've just stayed home and slipped the party this would've never happened \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f or maybe if they hadn't have left them with a random friend this wouldn't have happened. \n\nYou don't have to babysit if you are uncomfortable....or even if you just don't want to. It's not your obligation. If he still wanted to party he shouldn't have had 2 children so young. \n\nAnd idk where you are but if it is the states he is legally too young to drink. Him and his gf are irresponsible parents. \n\nDon't guilt trip yourself....and don't let your family either.\n\nEdit:skipped", "NTA\n\nThese children aren't your responsibility. The kids parents should learn that having kids puts a damper on their social life and stay tf at home with them. \n\nYour family needs to direct their displeasure to the two AHs that procreated and dump their children on other people so they can go out partying.", "NTA how was it your responsibility to know what your brother would do? Did they want you to look into your crystal ball and know he\u2019d act like an idiot?

You don't have a newborn and casually go off drinking yourself into oblivion until the next day.", "Oh my goodness!  NTA.  I'm so sorry (for the children's sake) to hear that your brother chose someone irresponsible to leave his two babies with so he could go party but that is not your fault and not your responsibility.  Child Protective Services should be called so that those babies are better protected.  (Yes, your family will call you a bigger AH if you do this.  You still should. ETA: you would be the AH if you don't -- those babies don't have anyone responsible caring for them and they need competent and responsible adult care!)", "NTA. Not your kids so really not your responsibility. Your brother needs to sort out his priorities and probably get a vasectomy.", "Woow\u2026 with the way your family reacted, you can expect that he\u2019ll do things like that over and over. \n\nNTA! In fact, him and your family are TA because they expect you to be responsible for children you didn\u2019t create and blame you for his irresponsible behaviour.

It wouldn\u2019t have happened if your brother and his girlfriend hadn\u2019t gone to the party.

Ignore the losers blaming you for something out of your control. Your brother, his gf, the friend, and the people hating on you are all AH's.", "NTA parents had the responsibility, not you. The rest of the family now giving you grief could have reached out if it was so important to give a break for the teen parents, but you had already done your share by taking the hyper 5 year old from your grand parents.", "NTA he\u2019s responsible for his kids, not you.", "NTA, they should wait for the kids to be older before going for this kind of party.  AND when the kids are bigger they should have enough money to pay a trusted babysitter .", "NTA\n\nFamily should be going nuclear on the irresponsible 'parents' not you!", "NTA. Stop taking any of the kids for a while. Tell everyone who gets mad that you\u2019re doing everyone a favor since you\u2019re too irresponsible. Remind everyone you did not go to a party dumping children with a stranger. But lesson learned; no parents, grand parent or other get to have a break now.", "NTA. I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that an eighteen year old that has already fathered two children would be so irresponsible as to leave them with an unreliable person so he can go \u201cparty\u201d.

Also normal parents don\u2019t get plastered when they have a 2 month old. IDGAF if they are \u201ctired\u201d and need a break. 2 month olds require a different level of care than other kids. Sevenish feedings a day, altered sleep schedules, constant changing, plus never letting them out of your sight, and you have a 1 year old and a 5 year old too\u2026 f that.", "NTA and everyone should be mad at your brother for leaving the kids with someone so irresponsible and even more angry with the friend for being so irresponsible and doing something so dangerous. A hyperactive 5 year old is a handful, a 1 year old is a handful, and a new born is a handful, and that\u2019s all of them on their own. All three together would be a lot to handle and not something you should be expected to do especially if you\u2019re not comfortable with it.

A mother of a two month old who dumps her kid to go drinking Wtaf! Most parents don\u2019t want the two month old around family let alone strangers. The decision making here is epically bad. That newborn is defenceless and a year old is as good as defenceless. If this is what they do with your knowledge imagine what is happening behind closed doors!", "Holy crap NTA\n\nYour brother is a neglectful parent. In fact, choosing a bad babysitter who would leave them ON A DOORSTEP IN THE COLD means he could be charged with neglect. \n\nThey\u2019re projecting onto you because he\u2019s given them grandbabies. \n\nTell them it\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s a bad parent.", "NTA, I would probably be looking into CPS tbh.", "NTA you are a very sweet and caring sister!

Absolutely in zero way in the wrong.\n\nEven if this was not a party and something they absolutely HAD to attend, you are very very mature and responsible for your understanding of your own abilities and limits.
