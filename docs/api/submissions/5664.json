Apparently your brother is such a loser everybody has come to think this behavior is normal and somehow make this your fault? I have a newborn this Christmas and had a Christmas Eve party as well. You know how we handled it? We didn\u2019t go.", "Your family needs to tell your brother that he chose to have kids, he needs to strep up and be a man. That means taking care of his kids if he can't manage to use birth control effectively.", "NTA but report him and the friend to CPS.\n\nWhat sort of assholes abandons their kids on Christmas to go drinking.\n\nWhat sort of assholes leave their kids with an irresponsible friend.\n\nWhat sort of asshole leaves babies out in the cold on Christmas morning. - abuse.\n\nReport them, offer to pay for a vasectomy for the brother, and ignore your asshole family members.", "NTA.  Your brother ruined his life by having kids so young, you shouldn't be paying for his indiscretions.", "Call whatever form of child protective services you have in your country. Unless you're in the general south they might have died at this time of year.\nNTA\n\nHe was irresponsible at 16 getting girl pregnant. He was irresponsible at 17 getting girl pregnant again and now at 18 he's irresponsible again, putting partying, drinking and probably sex, before safety of his children.", "NTA they shouldn't be blaming you they should be calling the police/CPS or the equivalent on the parents and friend.  You are entitled to say no especially when you are looking after another child, tge children's parents chose to leave the children that long with an irresponsible friend,  none of thus us your fault.", "Announce that this situation had taught you will no longer babysit for anyone in your family.", "> My family told me if I just agreed to take in the kids for one night, this wouldn\u2019t of happened. \n\nWell, there is another way this wouldn't happen, your brother & GF doing their god damn job and watch their own kids instead of dropping them at some AH friend \n\nNTA", "NTA - sounds like CPS needs to be called. I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re not the one who decided to have kids so young. Why are his kids now you\u2019re problem? They are parents now and life has changed. They don\u2019t get to dump the kids just because they can\u2019t go and party like they want to.  Call CPS because if they\u2019re willing to do that on Christmas what else are they doing that you don\u2019t know about.         \nI\u2019d personally never watch his kids. And you need to set your family straight. Don\u2019t get sucked into this situation. Stay far away. Once you give in once I bet they will dump them off all the time.", "NTA. Your brother is a TREMENDOUS AH and so is your family. When you have kids, you have responsibilities and you just can\u2019t assume you can just pawn them off on to someone else. One of these is a newborn too! This makes me so sad. \n\nGive your brother a pack of condoms for a stocking stuffer. This will not end well. He\u2019s an immature ass.", "NTA, but your brother and his gf are about to lose custody of their children with how they behave", "NTA.

Obviously your brother and his girlfriend didn\u2019t come back when they said they would which is why the \u201cfriend\u201d left the kids (which was wrong - should\u2019ve called or rang the bell til someone answered). And by blaming you, your family enabling your brother\u2026baby #3 on the way??", "NTA You weren't the one who had a baby or two. He was.

Buy him some damn condoms for christmas.", "NTA. OP, you did nothing wrong. I haven't gone to a party I could drink at since I had my first kid 12 years ago. I HAVE gone out with girlfriends less than 5 times while my husband watched the kids, and he's done the same. But when you're parents, it's hard to BOTH go somewhere and drink.\n\nThese two teenage parents chose drinking over the safety of their children. Not exactly a surprise, but everyone should be calling CPS and getting the police involved, not blaming their recklessness on you.", "Brother needs the snippy-snip.", "This!", "$20 per hour per child is quite low in some areas. I would suggest that the OP consider getting all babysitting fees IN WRITING and signed by brother and adding the following: 1) start and end times indicating an additional hourly fee for each hour per child going past the end time (usually time and a half or double time);  2) that food is provided for each child excluding prepared infant bottles or a fee of $5 per meal;  3) that OP shall reimburse brother if end time is earlier than anticipated.  I\u2019ll bet that once brother sees the contract he will cancel his babysitting request. GET CASH payment AND signed contract prior to accepting the kids. Since some family members think the OP is an AH, might as well give them something to bitch about.", "All the people shaming should be directing their ire to the children's parents. It's some kind of twisted logic where they find OP at fault.", "No, I think they\u2019re sexist.
