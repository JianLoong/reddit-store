We have a nanny to help with the kids but on Friday the nanny was taking my 5 year old on a class trip, I was with my 8 and 10 year olds for their sport, and my wife was helping her mom get ready for Easter so I needed my 18 year old to babysit my 18 month old and 12 week old. \n\nMy oldest never protested to babysitting. She\u2019s great with her siblings but I guess on Friday she didn\u2019t want to help with them so after I left she called her boyfriend (18) of 2 years to help her with the kids. She did not tell anyone that he was babysitting with her. I found out when I came home and the boyfriend was feeding my youngest.\n\nI asked my daughter what he was doing here and she said she asked him for help babysitting. I told her she can\u2019t bring random men around my kids without permission and she turned it into an argument about how I don\u2019t like her boyfriend for no reason. I tried to take her phone but she said I can\u2019t do that anymore since she\u2019s an adult so I took her off my phone plan and my car insurance and she\u2019ll be paying rent and utilities for her room. \n\nMy wife is completely against this and is using her savings to pay her phone bill and car insurance until I add her back to our plans, and she swears that if I make her pay rent she\u2019s leaving with the kids. Her family and my parents are on her side so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1681075829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gwg4u/aita_for_charging_my_18_year_old_rent_and_making/", "score": 1345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her boyfriend is not some \u201crandom man\u201d and was very nice for stepping in to help with a toddler and infant.  YTA, and get yourself fixed.", "YTA.\n\nGenerally, people who keep on popping out kids and expect their older siblings to coparent because they are not willing/able to supply the attention the younger kids need are major assholes.\n\nThere are of course the other stuff that make you even bigger asshole (rent? Srsly?), but I am more disgusted by people's unwillingness to buy a fucking contraception and stop being an asshole to their oldest kids\n\nHope it helped", "Of course YTA. Your 18 year old and her partner help you with childcare *for free*, something she has \"never protested\" about, and your response is to think *she* owes *you?*", "**YTA.  Stop having children if you/your wife are unwilling/unable to take care of them.**  You had choices - nanny didn't have to chaperone class trip, wife didn't have help her mother prepare for Easter, or you could have stayed home.  Your eldest sounds like a great teenager - and she wanted help with a toddler and infant.  Instead of being grateful that her boyfriend stepped up, you were vindictive. You are reaching out to strangers instead of looking at what your wife, and both sides of the families are saying.  You are wrong, and you need to apologize and make this right.", "yeah huge YTA. She's already doing unpaid work for you by babysitting. She wanted a break or at least someone to help her with what I assume is a pretty hard job (considering you have a 12 week old and an 18 month old). \n\nRemember she didn't make the choice to have children, you did. And her boyfriend isn't just some random man, I get not wanting strangers around your children alone but from what I can tell she was there all the time. \n\nIn a lot of countries in the north-western part of the world it's your job as a parent to provide for your children until they can take care of themselves (usually that means finished their education, including college/university). These laws exist for a reason. Your parenting duties don't simply end when your child turns 18", "YTA. A normal response would have been to greet him and thank him for keeping your daughter company during this last minute imposition on her time. Then you could have apologized for disrupting their Friday night plans, thanked them both again, and slid them $40 for their time and inconvenience. \n\nImagine if in response to your petty retaliation, your 18 yr old just never helped with her siblings again. Have fun finding a reliable sitter, and you\u2019re going to have to pay them. And you won\u2019t always get them if you have an emergency.", "YTA. You overreacted. This went from 0-100 really quick. How is her boyfriend of two years \u201crandom men?\u201d Lmao. Get out of here. Apologize, talk about rules, and move on.", "YTA.  Her bf of 2 years is hardly some \"random man\".  Also, your kids are YOUR responsibility, not your daughter's.", "Why couldn't you have cared for the youngest 2 and your daughter go to sport with the older 2? They're your kids,not hers. YTA.", "Yep. Huge AH. I can't believe you don't see that. The kids are YOUR responsibility, not hers. She is not free childcare, but that is how you treat her. You do know her bf. He's not some random guy. What you did was way over the top. You sound horrible to live with, entitled, ungrateful, controlling. I feel bad for your poor wife and kids.", "When I first read \"we have a nanny\" I couldn't read anymore because my eyes rolled so far back in my head, I needed to call my doctor.\n\nNow that I've finished reading, YTA. You force your oldest to provide childcare for infants for free at the last minute, and then you proceed to punish her because she had company to help - a random man who she's apparently been randomly dating for two years?\n\nThis reads like some weird overbearing, macho dad bs. Your daughter doesn't seem to have done a single thing wrong, and your wife is right. \n\nAgain, YTA", "YTA\n\nIf I were your wife, I'd be furious. She has two babies and an elderly mother to care for, plus three mid-sized kids. And you are driving her best helper away with your control games. If you don't provide eldest daughter with phone and car insurance, why would she want to live in a house with 4 little kids that she is expected to help raise? She will move out and leave you high and dry.", "YTA\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to babysit, that\u2019s her right.  She didn\u2019t choose to have these kids.  \n\nI don\u2019t understand being upset by the boyfriend either.  You didn\u2019t walk into them off having sex in her bedroom and the babies left to fend for themselves, you walked in on her boyfriend feeding a baby.  It is weird to restrict what friends your 18 year old can have over, even when you\u2019re not there, unless there is some serious criminal history this boyfriend has that you\u2019re leaving out.  \n\nCharging an adult child rent isn\u2019t something I\u2019d do (and I do have a 19 year old and a 20 year old who both live at home), but it is perfectly acceptable to do so\u2026it\u2019s not acceptable to do so out of anger and desire to punish an adult however.  \n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nYour daughter's boyfriend of two years is not a random stranger and she invited him over and he was helping with the kids. They weren't off having sex while the infants were left unsupervised. And your daughter was babysitting. You were not paying her to babysit but she was doing it anyway. \n\nI do find it interesting that your wife helping with Easter plans takes precedent over taking the five year old to a class trip. And that she couldn't take the infants with her like most parents would. Nor did you strap the infant into a carrier and take the baby with you. \n\nYou went nuclear for no reason and your wife is calling you out for it, as she should.", "YTA. If everyone in the family disagrees with you, turning to random strangers on the internet really shouldn't be your next move.", "YTA. Do you know any other 18 year olds who would watch two kids under two by themselves without notice? She got her boyfriend to HELP, which made it safer for all your kids. You are so far out of line.", "So with the added bills you\u2019ve given her for watching your kids with help for free, are you planning on getting a babysitter? Because I wouldn\u2019t expect her to do any favors for you anytime soon. And if you continue to treat your kids like this don\u2019t be surprised when they don\u2019t talk to you when they move out.", "You wanted your daughter to take care of a newborn and a toddler for free, without help? YTA for that alone, but you\u2019re ESPECIALLY TA for throwing a fit over the fact that her boyfriend was there helping. They weren\u2019t sneaking off, making out, doing drugs, etc he was helping feed YOUR baby. You need to apologize to your daughter.", "Yes YTA. Stop using your oldest as another parent for your kids. It\u2019s not her responsibility to take care of two babies, you need to get another nanny if you can\u2019t figure it out without her. \n\nThat out of the way, she still allows you to abuse her being there, but enlisted help from her boyfriend and you accuse her of having strange men around your kids? How about we revert back to my first point and you figure out taking care of your own kids.", "Oh for crying out loud \n\nTwo BABIES is a LOT of responsibility for an adult much less an 18 year old who may be legally one but is still not much more than a child ! She did what you asked of her and did the responsible thing knowing she would cope better with help and got someone she trusted in to help her ! \n\nApologise to her and undo what you\u2019ve done punishment wise cos honestly wtf \n\nYTA", "Why does a nanny need to go on a field trip is my #1 question of the day . YTA.  I\u2019ve worked in a school for 28 years without a parent even joining a field trip.  You decided to have all these kids not the kids.  Be an adult and take care of it or get a babysitter.  You don\u2019t know your daughters boyfriend of 2 years? We are missing info here", "YTA.\n\nIf you don't want her to bring her boyfriend around the kids then maybe stop leaving her to be solely responsible for them?\n\nPutting that responsibility on someone who is still really a child themselves is irresponsible of you. You can't then take it out on her if she makes a choice you disagree with.\n\nAlso, I'd be curious to know what transpired with your wife that it ended up with her threatening to leave and take the kids. That's not usually the kind of threat a spouse would make over one parenting disagreement.", "YTA- \n1. She didn\u2019t pop out these kids.\n2. They have been together for 2 years so he is not a random man.\n3. Again not her kids not her problem, at least she didn\u2019t make a fuss about babysitting", "Are you paying your daughter to babysit your fucking kids? And if your daughter needs help from her boyfriend to watch two of YOUR \nchildren, then you are a piss poor parent. \nYTA", "YTA. \nSounds like a good kid even by your own admissions. And asking her to watch a 3 month old and an 18 month old on her own is a lot. Good for her to bring in a helper. And it was someone you have known for 2 yrs - not just a random guy. Your reaction and punishment is pretty extreme given, in the end, she watched her siblings just with help.", "YTA - in more ways than can be describe succinctly. \n\nMaybe you make this the hill you die on and your family gets your dumb ass out of their lies.", "YTA. Full stop. a \"random man\" is not a  boyfriend who she's been with for two years, who you presumably have met since they've been together since she was a minor. if you make her pay rent for getting help babysitting YOUR CHILD, you deserve for your wife to leave with the rest of the kids.", "YTA for all the reasons everyone already listed.  Grow up and be a real man, a real father, and not a entitled petty little boy taking advantage of free childcare.  Love and treat your daughter the way she deserves to be loved and treated.", "YTA. She's been dating her boyfriend for 2 years, so he's hardly a \"random man.\" I'm sure you are somewhat acquainted with him. Otherwise you've been negligent as a parent if you don't know anything about the guy your daughter has been dating since she was 16. Your behavior here is outrageous. She showed up to babysit for you at the last minute, and I doubt you paid her for it. So what if she had her boyfriend over to help? You left her alone to take care of a newborn and a toddler. It's a lot, and they aren't her kids. Asking for help was a responsible thing to do. You're basically punishing your daughter for showing up to help when you were in a pinch for childcare. I'm glad that your children at least have your wife in their corner because they should have at least one reasonable parent and it isn't you.", "Mama of 6 here- so i am able to spea on this. Mine go from 19-5. \n\nFirst of all, a 12 week old is a BIG ask. They\u2019re hard. A 18 mo old is also very hard. They\u2019re into everything and pretty mobile but their brain are jelly and they\u2019re too stupid to keep themselves alive. \n\nYour daughter NEVER told you she didn\u2019t want to watch the kids and she did watch them. She was responsible and mature in bringing in help. If it was easy, you would have taken the littles with you. \n\nLittle kids are a pain in the ass to take anywhere and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t take them. I get it- you\u2019re not wrong. It sucks. My husband and I decided to stop having biokids bc we\u2019re are D. O. N. E. with toddlers. Toddlers suck. \n\nLet give you a little advice, tho, as a fellow big family parent to adults. You don\u2019t want your kids to leave at 18. It\u2019s not like it was when we were 18. They can\u2019t make it on their own. \n\nAlso, girls come back with babies. \n\nFigure out how to be nice to the bf even if you don\u2019t like him. Get her on birth control. It\u2019ll end, you want to be the good guy when it does. \n\nAlso, she\u2019s not just your kid anymore, she\u2019s a grown ass adult. You need to respect her as an adult. You should have been transitioning into her friend already. Your time to parent is over. Now you need to treat her like an equal. \n\nStill be there. Still support her. Apologize to her. Tell her you were wrong, plain and simple. Start paying her shit again- INCLUDING FOR BABYSITTING. Figure out how to respect her as a person. \n\nYou\u2019re doing this all wrong but it\u2019s not too late. You are a person of means, from your post, so get a babysitter. \n\nYTA. You have to do better.", "YTA.  That escalated quickly.  Her boyfriend of 2 years is most certainly not a random stranger.  You are overreacting to the max.  She should move out on her own ASAP if this is typical behavior she can expect from you.", "YTA for not being an adult about this.  I understand why you're not happy about not knowing the BF was coming over, but going nuclear isn't going to help the situation.  And if they've been dating for two years he's hardly a stranger.  And he was actually helping her do what you asked...they weren't screwing around.\n\nApparently you haven't talked to your daughter about expectations now that she's a legal adult.  Sit down with your daughter and \\*discuss\\* things instead of  treating her like a child. Because right now you're acting very immaturely...your wife and her family are right.", "It is perfectly valid for you to think that it's weird to have a man you don't even know over, but you do know this man! He's been your daughter's boyfriend for 2 years and I think you're just overreacting. Maybe she was just tired or needed some help so she called someone she could trust. And it's not like he was doing anything weird with the babies, in fact he was feeding them! YTA", "YTA. Her boyfriend of two years is not a random man.   Your reaction was way over the top.  And, I\u2019m just going to take a guess that this isn\u2019t your bio-kid.", "YTA. She needed help. She contacted someone she could trust to help. You berated her for it then if that wasn\u2019t bad enough you threaten her financial security. Thankfully she has a mom who gives a damn, cause it\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t.", "YTA. If you can't trust your oldest to have your other children's best interests in mind while babysitting maybe don't ask them to babysit?", "They\u2019re your kids that you chose to have. You watch them.", "YTA you are wrong in every single part of this story. What are you punishing her for? I can\u2019t understand what your problem is here. \n\nYou said she\u2019s great with her siblings, she always helps and she\u2019s been with this guy for two years. So you trust her judgement to care for children who are not her responsibility - they are yours. It sounds like You depend on her without asking if she\u2019s available. You have known this boy for two years and have no problem with her dating him. She is 18 years old. What are you punishing her for? He\u2019s not some random guy off the street.\n\nP.S. your wife is willing to lose you while caring for 5 children a young adult daughter. That\u2019s not a small statement to make. I\u2019m guessing your daughter is a bigger help. Swallow your pride and apologize.", "Since when is her boyfriend a random man?", "This is not the hill to die on, YTA", "Everyone is on your daughters side & your wife even threatened you with divorce. Yet you\u2019re here asking if YTA? Sir yes you are.", "YTA, you\u2019re using your daughter to babysit, and are upset that she did so without complaint and asked her boyfriend for help\u2026 I\u2019m assuming you weren\u2019t paying her to babysit\u2026 I hope your wife follows through.", "YTA \n\nOthers have summed this up quite clearly but good on mum for standing by her children. If this is the hill you\u2019re willing to die on your risk losing your family", "Yta. If you don't want \"random men\" looking after your kids, well then look after your own damn kids. Also stop parentifying your daughter. Stop having kids if you and your wife can't look after them", "YTA. Your daughter didn\u2019t have to babysit at all, maybe be thankful she doesn\u2019t protest. She needed help, she\u2019s watching two kids, one of which is a newborn, she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend. That\u2019s not unusual. Do you not trust your daughter? Do you think she\u2019d just leave him completely alone with the kids to do whatever he wanted with them? She\u2019s been with him for two years. You need to calm down. \n\nPunishing her over this is insane. You\u2019re basically asking her to leave and not talk to you again, you need to show your daughter some more grace and respect. Without her you\u2019d be SOL since you can\u2019t figure out how to take care of your kids without forcing other kids into babysitting for you. This seems like a flimsy excuse to get money out of your kid. The punishment doesn\u2019t make sense at all.", "Yta.   I think it\u2019s a knee jerk reaction to your daughter calling her boyfriend over to keep her company.  Its reasonable to set some ground rules in your home.  But if she\u2019s been dating this guy for two years, he\u2019s not a random stranger around your kids.  Your daughter is 18.  I doubt she wants to spend her Friday nights babysitting.   Allowing her to invite her boyfriend over to keep her company is a reasonable compromise.", "YTA. She called for help with babysitting. And she did it. She just asked for help, from a boyfriend you\u2019ve known for two years. \n\nAlso if she\u2019s still in high school you\u2019re an extra AH for charging her rent.", "I guess you have 5 more chances to not make your kid  resent you.\nYTA", "YTA. You just got pissed she got help instead of acting like your nanny.  I think charging your 18 yr old some rent/utilities to help out is defensible, but is this the hill you want your relationship with her to die on?", "YTA  \nThat's two babies!! One baby is hard enough, but to care for two by yourself is really hard.", "YTA\n\nThis post is the definition of \"disproportionate.\"\n\n\"Random men\" as in someone you knew for two years. C'mon man. \n\nIf you care about maintaining any form of relationship with your daughter in the near future, I'd suggest that you swallow your pride and try to reel some of this back in.\n\nIs she entitled to any of it? No. But she gave you *no valid reason* for you to rip it all away from her otherwise, if that was what was already in place. \n\nYou were mad, and it's easy to see that instead of waiting until you weren't mad, you took action in that very moment.", "YTA and a bad parent.", "YTA for the division of labor.  Your 18 year old could have taken the kids to sports.  YOU should have taken care of the little ones ALL BY YOURSELF.  Of course she asked for help, two kids that young are a lot to handle and YOU DUMPED IT ON HER AND RAN OFF. Your wife understands what you expected of your daughter, but apparently you do not.", "YTA. Were you paying her for babysitting or did you just expect her to be continuous free childcare for you and the rest of the Brady Bunch?
