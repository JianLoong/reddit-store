She asked, you answered, and she is selfishly placing her desires over your needs. Please accept my condolences for your loss. I hope that you have friends who are able to help your children and you during this time.", "I\u2019m very sorry for the loss of your son. I lost a child over a decade ago. It will get better in time. \n\nIn any case, NTA. All of them sound like psychos. This is harassment and could possibly merit criminal charges. You don\u2019t owe anybody a relationship, especially a complete stranger.  \n\nAnd this doesn\u2019t matter if you were grieving or not. It\u2019s your life and you get to decide whom you let into it.", "NTA! You don\u2019t owe anyone your time or energy. In addition you\u2019re grieving. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I\u2019m hopeful that going no contact with your \u201cfamily\u201d helps you heal.", "NTA. Very sorry for the loss of your child. Set whatever boundaries you need to and be kind to yourself.", "NTA, while she probably had some high expectations and maybe she needs this for herself for some reason, you have absolutely 0 obligations to her. Blood does not equal family in my experience and I\u2019m sure a lot of people will agree. Your dad seems extremely emotionally abusive and probably only cares about the image of family rather than actually doing what\u2019s best. I\u2019m so sorry for everything you\u2019ve gone/are going through. Focus on yourself and your kids, and do why you can. You\u2019re killing it!", "Damn this is rough. You are NTA. \nYou have every right to decide when and if you have any relationship with her. And if you want to go no contact with your dad. \nAlso I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. I really can\u2019t imagine and you do whatever you need to grieve.", "NTA - sometimes you just don\u2019t have the mental resources. She\u2019s excited because she\u2019s found family and you\u2019re grieving. Opposite ends of the emotional spectrum. She needs to dial it down a notch and exhibit some empathy for your situation. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA - she is a stranger to you. You don\u2019t owe her anything. Would it be nice of you to agree to meet her? Sure. But if you are struggling with your grief right now you have every right to decline. Self-care is important even if it\u2019s in the form of saying \u201cno\u201d to someone.", "NTA. But if your bio dad shows up with her, please be certain to give her the whole truth in terms of what he did to you growing up.", "You don\u2019t owe her anything NTA", "UGH NTA. THis woman is stepping over all your boundaries and acting like she can \"help\" which is very red flaggy IMO. She needs to accept that right now you are not up to the relationship - especially if she wants there to be any chance of one in future!", "NTA\n\nI think you were gracious about it. You really don't owe her anything, and even if someone else is doing most of the emotional labor, connecting or reconnecting to family takes a lot of energy. You were up front about not being interested in your father's sperm donee. \n\nThe only nitpicky issue I see is that you may well have burnt the bridge. In a year or two, when you're feeling more stable, you may want to reach out and establish the relationship, but she could be already done with you. But that's not really an asshole thing. \n\nAnd frankly, if she's really worth knowing, she should recognize that you didn't want to bring a stranger into your grieving.", "NTA for sure. You are grieving and taking it day by day. I have half-siblings and we are not close because the only thing we share is a common, sometimes available father. Even if you weren\u2019t grieving, you don\u2019t owe her a relationship. If one of my half-siblings wanted one from me I wouldn\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019ve known about them all my life. So NTA. Also, may your sons memory be a blessing.", "NTA boundaries, boundaries, boundaries. Plus, there is family of origin and family of choice. Because it\u2019s family of origin, it doesn\u2019t supersede one\u2019s own (and one\u2019s own family of choice) needs.", "NTA. I hope you get the space you and your children need to grieve. Please surround yourself with loved ones and people you trust.", "NTA. You declined and she kept pushing. You set a boundary and she ignored it. \n\nYou blocked a stranger that was harassing you online, end of story.", "NTA. You're an adult, you get to choose who you want relationships with, regardless of biological connection.  It sounds like you already have a very complicated family situation, and that coupled with your son's passing, I don't blame you for not being interested in pursuing a relationship with her (for now, at least). Your dad's reaction to this showed  his true colors, and I think blocking him was a smart move. For those family members giving their input, they are not you, they don't know the ins and outs of your familial relationships, and they have not walked in your shoes; Shame on them for jumping to conclusions, making assumptions, and judging you.\n\nFWIW, I have half siblings I did not grow up with. They have been very inconsistent in my life, by their own choosing. I put up with it for a long time by the guilt of my parents, but eventually I realized these relationships had no value- they were superficial at best. We had nothing in common, none of us had a yearning to build a relationship, and it all felt very faked and forced. So I just stopped getting together with them, contacting them. Our shared parent isn't happy about it, but he doesn't care enough to push it (though he does low effort try to guilt me). What i've learned through dealing with it all is to set boundaries for myself, despite what anyone else says, and learn how to not feel guilt pushed on me by someone else. I hope you are able to get to that point.", "NTA.", "I can appreciate where the woman is coming from, but no you are not responsible for building a relationship with her. If you don\u2019t have the bandwidth, you don\u2019t have the bandwidth and she needs to understand that. The fact she\u2019s not getting it is a little\u2026concerning (not sure if thats the right word but hopefully you get what i\u2019m saying). Anyways if your father is so concerned about involving her in the family, he is more than welcome to build a relationship with her instead of putting it on you.", "NTA at all. Tell your dad to fu koff. Maybe her later but zero bandwidth is so true. You need lots of time at this point. Think only of your kids. Bar everyone else. Sorry about your boy.", "NTA. You put your boundaries out there and made it clear where you are in life.  They may truly care about your wellbeing, but honestly she's a stranger and he's lost your trust from abandoning you as a child. Take time to grieve with your children. See a therapist.  But, no... you're not the asshole for wanting space in dealing with the loss of a child in your own way.", "NTA \n\nA few years ago wr found out my grandfather's dad never passed away like his mother told him. He got remarried and had 5 more kids. Only the oldest 2 knew there was an elder half sibling out there. I connected to his half sisters daughter through Ancestry and met in person a few times. But I would never, and she (my whatever she is older family member) would never push to pursue a interwoven relationship at this point. We support the family from a distance (Facebook friends and the like. Shes about 12 years younger than my father) but it's too much to expect a full blown relationship for a complete stranger\n\nYour half sibling is pushing this and she should respect your boundaries. There is no bond and your father is the AH for trying to push one.", "NTA\n\nIt could be nice to have another relative, but not at this particular moment.\n\nSo how is it your dad has this unknown child?\n\nIf you and your children need help getting through this grief, ask your dad and step-mother.", "NTA. You are grieving the loss of your son. You don't have the time, desire or bandwidth to deal with feeling someone else's wants or needs just because you share the same dad. You don't know this woman. You need to focus on your family. If anyone has a problem with that then cut them off. Focus on what matters is getting yourself and your children through your loss.", "NTA.  It sounds like your father is trying to push her off on you so  he doesn't have to deal with her himself.\n\nHow many of these other relatives are offering to invite this lady into their homes and welcome her into the family?  Why is this your job?", "NTA at all.  Only you can decide when you are ready to engage in a relationship, if ever, with this random stranger, and yes that is the way I see her.  Blood means nothing.  Your \"abusive\" mother and fake father and sm should be ample proof of that.", "NTA", "NTA", "I am so sorry for your loss. You are NTA at all here. This woman may be your half-sister but she is a complete stranger to you. You are not in a place to be able to deal with her right now and that's okay! You do NOT owe her anything.  Don't feel bad about blocking her, your father, or anyone else who tries to make you feel guilty about not entertaining her \"happy family\" idea. Your mental health is important, too.", "Sorry for what you're going through.\n\nNTA.  You explained and instead of giving time and space she boundary stomped you over what she wanted.  \n\nShe is quite frankly a stranger and not giving you an impression to make you want to change that.  And what your dad said about just showing up.  If he does that don't be shy about declaring no contact.  Because after seeing this line \n\"My children don't have much of a relationship with them because they have no interest in one, live 30 minute away and reluctantly see them once a year at my initiative.\"\n\nI wonder what the insistence on seeing this half sister is.", "NTA\n\nI cannot fathom contacting a stranger, whose details I was given without their knowledge, and demanding to be suddenly let into their life, and being mad that they're not on board.", "NTA ever. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. You need to focus on yourself. Don\u2019t ever feel forced to have a relationship you can\u2019t commit to or want to commit to. Your dad is an AH", "So sorry for your loss. \n\nNTA in the least. Even if you weren't grieving, you wouldn't owe this stranger any emotional bandwidth. Keep on looking after yourself and your kids.

I can only assume that your half sister is either so excited to have found her birth father and family that she has zero perspective or she is a narcissistic ah like your father.

But you're right, she'll probably not want anything to do with me in the future.", "Thank you.", "Thank you.", "When my parents got divorced apparently he had a lot of freedom since he only took visitation rights, then promptly moved to a different state. So her mom was one of his girlfriends.", "Thank you. He's needed to be blocked for some time,  so I definitely think cutting him off is for the best.", "Thank you. After this I blocked him. I would have done it after the funeral when he blamed me but my children's therapists didn't want me to do that right away, they were afraid it would give them the impression he was only in their lives because of their brother, not for them. But after this I think it's just for the best to be done.", "Yeah that really bothered me but I wasn't sure if it should or if I was just being oversensitive!", "Thank you.", "Thank you", "Thank you.  Best to you.", "Oh my\u2026no words\u2026he\u2019s a monster. ((Hugs)) from an internet stranger \ud83d\udc95", "As women, we are taught to be people pleasers and not to say \u201cno\u201d. That can weigh on us because we feel like we are letting people down. BUT A person who is genuinely concerned with having a sisterly connection would take that in stride and understand you are asking for time to grieve. We all experience grief in in our own way. There\u2019s a very real possibility for you to meet her later when you feel up to it, but she\u2019s TA for not respecting your wishes. My heart goes out to you. Sometimes even seemingly small things are difficult during times of sadness. Hopefully she\u2019s just overwhelmed with excitement at finding you and will come to her senses. There is nothing wrong with putting yourself first.", "Yeah, it's not a big deal. And honestly, odds are it'll only generate some short-term awkwardness if she really is sincere about connecting with genetic family. As far as assholery goes, I'd put this on a par with not remembering your cousin's boyfriend's name at Thanksgiving. \n\nSure, there's a chance she'll never want anything to do with you, but there's also a chance you'll never want anything to do with her.\n\n[edit] One more thing - your dad is being a tool. Try really hard not to let his shit color your opinion of her. If he really does drag her over and try to force a relationship, please don't assume it was her doing, or blame her too much for whatever bullshit he pushes her into. Who knows what he told her, that sort of thing is all on him. When you're in a better place, it may be worth reaching out directly to her - plus if she's gotten over some of the excitement about long-lost family she might be more tolerable too.", "Weird that her mother never informed him or pursued any kind of support. \n\nBoth red flags.", "That is weird but it what my uncles and aunts have said is accurate some of the women he was seeing were married so my thought was maybe it was one of those situations where she found out the man she thought was her dad wasn't. Or I could be reading too much into this and the woman just never told him. Maybe she saw he was not the kind of guy that would stick around to raise his child."]}
