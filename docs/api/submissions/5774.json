You're a good son. Your brother is an inconsiderate individual who, yes, has been enabled by your parents, BUT they sound like they don't know how to tame the monster they've created. They co-signed your position, effectively making it theirs - it is their house, not your brothers. He can go kick rocks. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour bother is spoiled and abusing your parents' kindness.\n\nThis is your parents' problem. They created this monster and you cannot fix it for them as long as they are of sound mind.\n\nIf they are at-risk elderly adults, then you can call protective services. If they are not, then they need to kick him out and force him to grow up and allow him to fail.", "NTA as long as you're firm but respectful about this whole thing, you and your folks also have the right to enjoy peace and quiet in their own home.", "NTA, my housemates ask everyone else when having a party. When you're at your parents house a party shouldn't even be on the table unless it's an event. No issue with having a friend or two over every so often and them chilling with your parents too but ffs, when do your parents get to actually enjoy themselves in their own home and relax", "NTA, but don't expect results. Until your parents find their spines and stand up for themselves, this is just going to go on forever. Ultimately, they are living with the monster/problem that THEY have created. You would not be wrong to keep an eye on the situation - one day they will be vulnerable/elderly and your brother seems like he would take financial advantage of that.", "Your parents have enabled his behaviour, fund his lifestyle, provide free food for your brother to do as he likes. It\u2019s shit ! But if they let him that is their choice. You can\u2019t start making rules because you don\u2019t live there anymore. Tbh it\u2019s your parents responsibility to discuss his behaviour and put boundaries in place, if they aren\u2019t doing it, It\u2019s for you to either put up with his behaviour or don\u2019t stay there.", "NTA", "NTA but your brother is acting entitled and being a leech at his age and inviting more parasites over.  Your brother is a major AH who needs to grow tf up.  Your folks need to cut the apron strings as they have done a huge disservice to him by coddling him, he is behaving like a spoiled child instead of a 27 yr old man, he is a disgrace and a bum.", "NTA- you need to talk to your parents since it is there house.\n\nIf they want you to help them keep put strangers, you can have a sit down with them and your brother. But they have to be on board", "Probably NAH. Despite being your childhood home, you are the guest right now. And while it's certainly uncomfortable and annoying to you, your brother has your parents permission to have all these friends over.\n\nYou've got a pool, that basically guarantees kids friends will be there all the time in the summer months.", "YTA but here\u2019s why. You no longer live there to dictates what happens there. If your parents choose to enable you brother and these antics, that\u2019s their choice! They could put the foot down with him but they choose not to. Just like they choose to let a 27 year old continue to live at home, does he pay rent? Help with the utilities, food etc? I understand it\u2019s also you childhood home and your there visiting for the holidays, but to it\u2019s not really your place as a \u201cguest\u201d anymore to dictate what your brother does or doesn\u2019t do imo", "Yta. \n\nThis is not your house. You don't get to say who can come over and who can't. \n\nThis is your parents house. If they don't mind his friends. Then he is not doing anything wrong. \n\nSounds like they they don't mind. That they only did something because you complained.", "Yta he lives there yu don\u2019t. Yo parents don\u2019t seem to mind only when yu come around.

Your brother will never listen to you as you have no power over him. Your parents created this frat house. You will need to talk to your parents about the situation they created.", "YTA you don\u2019t live there he does. Unless your parents asked you to intervene you are in the wrong", "YTA. That is his house. He has a right to invite people over, just like your parents invited you!\n\nEdit: you also can't fight your parents' battles. They don't like it but they allow it because he throws fits? It's something they need to deal with. I understand you are fed up, but only your parents have power here.", "YTA.  \n\nWow.   The audacity you have visit your brothers house as a guest and then make demands.     Your behavior and attitude is entitled and honest, it is absolutely insane to me.", "But he\u2019s not a kid. He\u2019s 27!  Absolutely old enough to A) make sure he\u2019s not inconveniencing anyone with throwing his parties and b) to contribute. If his friends are all coming over and BBQing, they should be providing the food/beverages, etc. (EDIT:  they being the brother who should provide for his guests).", "I should just add , hope OPs' parents have good homeowners insurance because if someone gets hurt depends where they live chances are they ll be responsible. OP should talk to her parents because they are owners, and only they can put stop on brothers' behavior.", "Not sure why it matter but no, he doesn\u2019t pay for anything in the household (rent, utilities, his phone, etc).\nRegarding the guest thing I understand and I try not have too much of an opinion on things even though my parents are adamant this is still my house as everyone\u2019s and I should act as such.", "They do mind, as I said in the post they just don\u2019t like arguing with him because he gets very loud, crying fits, etc. they are just tired being 60 yo using energy to argue with a 27 yo who should know social cues.", "He's NTA and here's why it isn't the brother's house he's just basically a leech living off mommy and daddy paying for nothing and thinking he should get his way by crying like a toddler \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f nah", "You realize not every social event is a potluck right?  That many people invite their friends over and take care of the food and beverages?", "It matters to an extent that your parents are enabling him. If they don\u2019t want his friends over all the time and they choose not to hold him accountable to act like an adult and help the house he lives in, they\u2019re enabling him. And I really didn\u2019t want to call you TA but the difference I see is that he does live there and you don\u2019t. So you don\u2019t get it dictate what he does or doesn\u2019t do in his home. Yes it will always be your home as well, but if you\u2019re parents are ok with his behavior & antics there isn\u2019t much you can do.", "I realize that. My point was more to as the OP relayed it, brother continually coming over and having large gatherings and eating/drinking the parents food. I didn\u2019t mean that the guests should all bring food. I was referring to the brother providing for the guests. I\u2019ll clarify.", "It's rare for my friends (late 20s/early 30s) to come to an event without offering to bring something, taking it upon themselves to bring something, or helping me clean at the end.

A legitimate monster they will be paying for 20 years from now while he tries to \"hold onto his youth\"", "NTA. Your brother is obviously an entitled AH who is abusing your parents.", "NTA but your parents should have put a stop to this long ago. As long as they let him get away with it, he's going to keep doing it."]}
