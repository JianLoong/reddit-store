For all we know the lizard will be just fine in 'lesser' living conditions.\n\nAsk your question again but then ask: Who gets to define it's an unsafe home? You do? Why? Do you get to just 'say no' and that's the end of it? The other person doesn't get a say at all? Don't you think that situation might need a little bit of ***arbitration***?\n\nIf a parent of a child was living in a mansion, with that child, and then moved out to live in a much more impoverished location, would you deny the parent their child just because the living situation isn't as good?\n\nIf you truly believe the living situation is unsafe, *prove that to an objective, informed, applicable third party*. That was my point. Either you're right or you're not.\n\nAs much as we all love AITA, it is not a true applicable third party. Not when a lizard's life is on the line.\n\n\\~\n\nI may have simplified it down to just 'call animal control' but let me offer a more practical detailed suggestion: Conference call the kid and someone from animal control, explain the situation, and ask animal control to confirm whether or not transferring the lizard would be abuse to the lizard to do so. If the person from animal control needs more information to make that determination, give it to them. And then you both abide by that determination.\n\nOr if you can't get animal control to do it, then that's what pet custody court is for.\n\nSame thing you'd do if it was some adult trying to claim ownership of a pet you don't feel they deserve. That was my point all along; the OP is making this decision *for* their child one-sidedly when they don't get to do that if it's any other adult. \"Because I said so\" stopped being allowed the moment their child grew up. He needs to find another way to resolve this, and what better way than an objective, informed, expert third party arbitrator?\n\nFrankly this is very similar to what's been suggested by others, of the whole \"explain it to him that this would hurt the lizard.\" Except I suggest letting a third party do it. Because, in addition to multiple other reasons (this is how you would handle it if it wasn't your own kid, it also may be easier to take if it comes from a third party, etc.), there's still a possibility that the third party might actually say *OP* was in the wrong, and *OP* is the one that needs that explanation. From an objective, informed, expert third party arbitrator that isn't reddit AITA.", "Again, you're putting words in my mouth. You're the one making all the assumptions here.

Unless it meets the criteria for abuse or neglect (ps: an aquarium can function perfectly well as reptile housing especially if it\u2019s going to be roaming around the apartment) they can screw right off with their opinions. \n\nThis entire mentality you weirdos have is entitled and privileged AF.

Gizzy stays where he gets the best care.", "NTA - Even though your son is no longer living at home, living off campus with other peers in college is not the same as moving out into the adult world. If they don't have clean dishes/clothes/sheets/etc, they make do. Based on the imagery you provided, they basically wing it. That's not necessarily knocking how they are living; it's part of becoming an adult and sorting what's important and what's not.  \n\nIt sounds like you have a lovely home and the means to provide Gizzy with a great Gizzy life.  Living in a home where everything that was necessary for Gizzy was provided - all the lizard accoutrements that I have no clue about, but that lizard expert in a previous comment does - is not the same thing as juggling 'the college experience' with the planning and forethought it takes to care for another being, especially one who has been so well cared for.\n\nIf you haven't already, acknowledge that your son misses Gizzy, consider that your son may be a little homesick and feeling like Gizzy being with him may ease that (we know it won't).  Also acknowledge that you both love Gizzy and want the best for him/her AND you want your son to have the freedom to experience his college years with the normal amount of college responsibilities (like studying and figuring out what he wants to do with the rest of his life). Lay out everything, as in every single thing, that is truly involved in providing for Gizzy and that most normal college kids don't have the time or resources to do that. You'll keep Gizzy safe and happy, while your son focuses on college. It's not a matter of if your son can take care of Gizzy, it's that you have the ability to provide for Gizzy which allows your son the freedom to explore, learn and grow. You are both incredibly fortunate. \n\nTLDR: NTA - I don't think that your son thinks of Gizzy as a prize to be won in this battle of wills, I'm guessing that he's just not thinking it all the way through because he doesn't have the wisdom that comes from adulting [yet].", "Even if your son is dependable and responsible, it isn't his house. 3 other frat guys, plus God knows how many people going in and out...\nNTA.

It absolutely will stress him out a lot, especially if he's confined to an aquarium after years of free-roam.

It wasnt my in5entiom to sound entitled, and the terms I use is just out of habit because animal behavior and welfare is literally my course speciality and what I work with.

Can you tell me what an aquarium would need to be able to acomodate an iguana? And just as other people who have knowledge on this sort of pet mentioned before, letting an iguana roaming around isnt ideal. Besides there is a huuuuge different between a iguana roaming in a garden and inside an apartment.\n\nAgain, I say all of this based on the knowledge I have of these animals. All I did was point out that if the son truly cares for the iguana, he would easily understand that moving it is not ideal for Gizzy.

It doesn\u2019t help that OP frames things in a way that denigrates their kid while praising their own iguana-f-pad lifestyle providing ability and has a timeline that really suggests it\u2019s about OP forming a bond with him while looking after him (and possession is 9/10ths of the law so the son has no real ability to get him back) as opposed to having some deep concern about his son\u2019s ability to house him.\n\nAnd I mean the kid will just buy another iguana (thus traumatizing a fresh victim, apparently) so all this concern for Gizzy on OP\u2019s part really rings hollow.", "OP is not a random neighbour.

If you're a part of the .1% who is actually a good owner, it sounds clear your son won't be. \n\n\nI'd argue that part of allowing a child to get a pet as a parent is to be willing to take care of it always, because oftentimes these pets will still be alive and well by the time the kids become adults and move off to college. So on some level I'd say there's an obligation to care for the iguana properly on your end, and it sounds like your son can't provide that.\n\nIf things still keep up with your wife, maybe show her a short video of an iguana expert talking about how nightmarish they are and how terribly iguanas suffer and die when they don't have exactly what they need.

One of our neighbours asked if we could sbowblow her car park, but our tractor was ancient and inconsistent so we said no. We don't want you relying on it. It was a single space park right on the road edge so not a huge thing to maintain alone. She decided to report us for abuse, because we had one goat who had gotten frost bite as a kid on her ears and hind hooves, she was 2-3 years old when I got her. She told them we had cut them off, and she was bleeding all over. They came out, and see she's wearing booties and socks to keep her nubs safe, and had multiple pairs, changed 2 times a day minimum. She was fully active, goating and playing, slower than other goats but goating. No blood, no injury, no danger. They said they had never seen goats happier or healthier, and all our facilities were above average for all animals. No shit. You guys call us for everything other than dogs and cats. They still did random and planned visits for the next year, during that time we got called for a bunch more animals they couldn't handle. That goat lived to be about 12. She was a grand old thing. Her name was Hop-Along Cassidy, or Cassie for short.\n\nA few years later, we got told about a horse who had an eye injury. We went out. Severe eye injury and infection. The farmer said he'd run into a branch a year before but the horse wasn't worth the bullet to put him down. Another was limping, underweight and in need of a farrier, and about 20 we couldn't actually see. We convinced the guy to let us take the eye case, no space for any more, and we knew he would blow the budget vet wise. His eyeball was a write off sonit was removed. The flesh around the eye had turned into proud flesh. The infection had caused degradation of his skull, so that needed dealt with. The vet bills were enormous, and if he had been treated originally, it would not have been anywhere near as bad. We called and reported him. They went out once, told the guy how many violations he had and said we'll be back in 3 weeks, we need farrier bills and vet bills for these specific cases, rest look ok. 3 weeks later they went back, the ones they asked for records on were conveniently missing. Oh this one has this accident and died. That one did that and died. Oh, ok mister farmer. Case closed have a nice day. \n\nI get that rescues deserve scrutiny. Theres a lot of bad ones. And if you are trusted with unusual cases, they need to be sure. But jeez it stung."]}
