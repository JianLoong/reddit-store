The lizards current home with Pop is.", "yes by moving the iguana into the apartment. iguanas need plenty of space because they can grow to be pretty big and can sometimes get more aggressive with age. suddenly moving a pet without letting them get accustomed to the new environment can end really bad. worst case scenario is he ends up releasing the iguana into wild because rehoming them, especially when they\u2019re grown, is extremely difficult because they require different care than other pets.", "I asked and he said the son would be downgrading the Pet's space to move with him, so I agree with the dad.

Would you say it\u2019s morally ok to send a child to live in an unsafe home?\n\n*And instantly call child protective services*?\n\nYou're missing that part of the question.\n\nAnimal control is the say on what is or isn't the proper habitat for a lizard.\n\nIt's an objective, informed, expert third party arbitrator.\n\nWhy are you avoiding an objective, informed, expert third party arbitrator?\n\nIf you're actually right, wouldn't the arbitrator agree with you?\n\n*I* don't know anything about the living conditions necessary for a lizard. For all we know the lizard will be just fine in 'lesser' living conditions.\n\nAsk your question again but then ask: Who gets to define it's an unsafe home? You do? Why? Do you get to just 'say no' and that's the end of it? The other person doesn't get a say at all? Don't you think that situation might need a little bit of ***arbitration***?\n\nIf a parent of a child was living in a mansion, with that child, and then moved out to live in a much more impoverished location, would you deny the parent their child just because the living situation isn't as good?\n\nIf you truly believe the living situation is unsafe, *prove that to an objective, informed, applicable third party*. That was my point. Either you're right or you're not.\n\nAs much as we all love AITA, it is not a true applicable third party. Not when a lizard's life is on the line.\n\n\\~\n\nI may have simplified it down to just 'call animal control' but let me offer a more practical detailed suggestion: Conference call the kid and someone from animal control, explain the situation, and ask animal control to confirm whether or not transferring the lizard would be abuse to the lizard to do so. If the person from animal control needs more information to make that determination, give it to them. And then you both abide by that determination.\n\nOr if you can't get animal control to do it, then that's what pet custody court is for.\n\nSame thing you'd do if it was some adult trying to claim ownership of a pet you don't feel they deserve. That was my point all along; the OP is making this decision *for* their child one-sidedly when they don't get to do that if it's any other adult. \"Because I said so\" stopped being allowed the moment their child grew up. He needs to find another way to resolve this, and what better way than an objective, informed, expert third party arbitrator?\n\nFrankly this is very similar to what's been suggested by others, of the whole \"explain it to him that this would hurt the lizard.\" Except I suggest letting a third party do it. Because, in addition to multiple other reasons (this is how you would handle it if it wasn't your own kid, it also may be easier to take if it comes from a third party, etc.), there's still a possibility that the third party might actually say *OP* was in the wrong, and *OP* is the one that needs that explanation. From an objective, informed, expert third party arbitrator that isn't reddit AITA.", "Again, you're putting words in my mouth. You're the one making all the assumptions here. OP literally said\n\n\"I've been to their place and it looks like a bunch of 10yo's live there\"\n\nSo outside of his own words explaining their situation, which lines up wih my thoughts, College kids keeping a tidy and sanitary home while living on their own is not the social norm. Seriously trying to pretend otherwise is laughable.", "LOL. Ok.", "Yes. Very LOL when someone is shown they're wrong and refuses to acknowledge it.\n\nEnjoy your day", "NTA. Can we get a picture of Gizzy? Lol", "NTA, An iguana is not a frat mascot. Tell your son that unless he wants Gizzy to die of shock in a month, he should leave him where he is.", "NTA. But I think getting into a power battle over the iguana isn\u2019t productive. So why not use the other power? I assume a vivarium costs a lot of electric?\n\nLay out how much money running the vivarium costs (esp if he pays utilities), how much trave might cost if he takes the iguana there (like does he now need to drive it home each school break or hire an iguana sitter if he goes away?) Does he need renters\u2019 insurance to cover pets? Like if the vivarium blows the electrics rather than the iguana damages stuff?\n\nI got the impression your son is financially supported by you so don\u2019t threaten him with that but sit him down and point out if he has to pay the electric and extra gas, then because that would cost you more as it is supplementing the extra house rather than being the existing set up where Gizzy had always lived and your own home, then you\u2019ll need to find a way to adjust for the X dollars. \n\nGo all because you know you and your son both want the best for the iguana so could he get a job to cover this or maybe cutting back on Y is better with his classes? Leave it with him to think over. Make it clear the second the iguana leaves to move in you are believing in your son that he is taking adult responsibility for it and you are giving up \u2018grandparent rights\u2019 to \u2018godparent rights.\u2019 As in not fall back custody or cash for the iguana issues but cute memes and fond chat.\n\nPut the ball in your son\u2019s court. For example if they all pay utilities and the vivarium makes the bills go up for everyone, he has to inform them and get agreement or cover the extra. Start making him responsible for this \u2018grown up\u2019 side of animal ownership and see how he does. If he comes back all planned out, prepped and shows real commitment, then the iguana goes to college! If he doesn\u2019t then the iguana stays home and you only revisit the subject in this impartial \u2018best for Gizzy\u2019 way. Otherwise it looks like some Lion King thing of the younger male fighting the older one to capture dominance over an exotic pet. Do not get in a pissing contest over an iguana.\n\nAlso people getting your kid/teen a pet includes a plan what to do when the kid hits 18 and goes to college. That is the reality that animals often need stability for their own good and if you get a cat/dog/iguana/budgie without factoring in lifestyle drop if your adult kid takes it in or how they cost that or manage rent, you have skipped a big step of young adulthood pet ownership. \n\nI got a pet African land snail when I was about 10. Pre internet days. I did not know they can live FORTY YEARS in captivity. It lived a nice cosy life by the heat in a big tank, required peat to live in and was nocturnal. I started thinking about college when I was about 17 and for me this involved emigrating. I would need to transport everything from one European country to another first go for car in a long drive, would live in university halls at least the first year and then rent. I would probably travel home for major holidays. What was I going to do with a 30 litre fish tank and 30cm snail?\n\nHave it live in my tiny room squelching all night in nocturnal sliming? Get a snail sitter for Christmas? Pay excess shipping to get it there to be the snail girl and probably never get laid when people found this weird room mate scenario? I was oddly fond of the snail despite it being a very dull pet. I was sad to give it up having grown him from 1cm but I started researching homes for him and put ads in the local vets \u2018home wanted for giant snail. Brings own house. Can you provide space for tank and all the cucumber and cuttlefish it can eat? Yours for free.\u2019\n\nTook about 9 months but just before Christmas the landline goes. \u2018Is that the snail lady? Do you still have the snail?\u2019 The snail went to live with a family who were animal mad and had reptiles, ferrets, donkeys and a whole menagerie. They knew their stuff. They used to send a Christmas card until my mum moved house and we lost touch about 7 years later. Always labelled \u2018snail mail.\u2019 There were 4 boys and each \u2018inherited\u2019 the snail as one left home with a legacy plan in place.\n\nI like to think nearly 25 years on the snail is quite possibly still alive and has been passed from suitable guardian to guardian over the decades. I hope it was warm and had space to grow to its full football helmet sized potential after I could no longer be the best carer for it. Because that is part of pet care: transitioning a family pet to a grown up kid\u2019s pet or not. I did not have budget or capacity for a much less high maintenance pet than an iguana and my mum made it clear she was not a snail mom. It was a living creature and that meant I needed a plan.\n\nI have never had a pet since. I realised at that point even a houseplant doesn\u2019t fit my lifestyle. I\u2019m happy with that. Childhood pets were a valuable experience that I had to see through but didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t take a break from pets until appropriate again.

Yes they are awesome to show off but they take a lot of care", "Sounds like you love the lizard lol", "NTA. that would be animal cruelty", "NTA but sit down and really lay it all out there. I can only imagine how a bunch of drunk guys would think he was something to play with.", "Nta", "My nephew had 2 young dogs when renting a house.  He had to move into an apartment that didn't allow pets, so asked his parents to take care of them.  After about 6 months my SIL told him via phone, \"you do realize you are never getting these dogs back, don't you?\"  She had a similar reasoning...dogs were now used to having 2 other doggy companions, dogs had a big yard to run around in, in temperate southern California weather, dogs were not left alone all day as my brother worked from home and SIL was not working.\n\nHe got it.  \n\nNTA", "You are NTA. Great adulting!", "NTA that much of a shift in qol for a pet would not be good. Ease up on the whole treating the pet like it\u2019s on a pedestal on your end but yeah no I would not move it to their campus as you will go from a \u201cbig lizard\u201d to a \u201cbig pissed off lizard\u201d odds are gizzy will probably tail whip some one at the new enclosed space.\n\nSolution son gets an appropriate size lizard for smaller space Ie big fish tank and a bearded dragon or something that doesn\u2019t need a house sized roaming area.", "NTA. Gizzy doesn't deserve the treatment he'd get in Animal House.", "NTA. Animals much like children are incapable of being able to say hey this is what\u2019s best for me and as a result we adults need to make decisions that aren\u2019t always going to be a persons best interest but it is in the animals best interest.", "NTA. I can almost guarantee that pets are not allowed in college housing. It's a non-issue.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s his pet. You bought it to be his pet. You even describe it as his pet.\n\nI get that your concerned about his living condition, but does that mean only rich people with nice houses can have pets? Of course not.", "YTA. Is this the hill your willing to die on? Is this worth creating distance between you and your son? What if he buys another iguana what would you say about that? As a mother let me say there are so many battles we have to walk through if your son is 20 and you two get along well and you like that then I would suggest you stop and listen to your wife!", "NTA.  The animal's welfare needs to come first.  Don't let him grind you down on this.", "NTA, the welfare of the animal should come first, not someone\u2019s feelings of ownership. College is a TERRIBLE environment for pets, even for the most responsible pet owners and the easiest pets, which reptiles are not \n\nI think you did the right thing", "NTA I can understand that he wishes to have his pet with him but he should think about the confort of the iguana. I can't see how he would be able to provide it the same quality of life and space in a frat room. It's not about whom it belongs to but more about where it would be more happy, safe and well cared for.", "Nta it\u2019s not his.. minors cannot own animals.. so Gizzy is technically your lizard. I presume you (or your wife) still own Gizzy as I doubt your son adopted him from you when he turned 18. It\u2019s YOUR lizard 1000% Also yes this is a hill to die on that iguana will not be taken care of if your 20 year old college student son & three other 20ish college students has him. I\u2019m so happy you care so much for the iguana as many people don\u2019t care for \u201cscary\u201d animals or pets they get their kids. You care about an animal\u2019s well being that\u2019s not being controlling and over emotional it\u2019s having empathy for another living being. Also there\u2019s a chance he probably isn\u2019t allowed to own pets where he lives. Please know Gizzy appreciates you caring for him so much. You\u2019ll never be in the wrong for caring about the well being of YOUR animal", "YTA. It's his pet and pets are property under the law.", "This. I'm actually concerned about the iguana's care a bit - free roaming the house isn't exactly appropriate, they need a specific temperature gradient and UVB, but they mention a large Viv too. Hopefully it actually sounds most of its time there. Being treated like a human /=/ the best welfare for the animal.", "Thank you for pointing out diet requirements, even if OP doesn't need it, other people who may have/be thinking of getting an iguana may need it.\n\nIt's actually shocking how little people know or actually research animals. We did exotic animal rescue when I was younger, and we got a call about an iguana at a local humane society who needed a placement. He had obviously been kept on a space too small for him, his entire spine and tail were kinked up. And then someone had abandoned him on a city street in February in Canada.  The humane society had him on concrete in the indoor/outdoor dog run area, with a desk lamp and a plate of canned dog food in front of him. They didn't know they needed veggies and that that food wasn't appropriate and didn't care. It was horrific.", "Have my award.  From a fur mom who worries constantly about  lost,  abused and neglected critters.  Your reply was spot on.", "You are sensible OP. Gizzy is well cared for in your house not in a small frat house. I wish more people thought about getting animals in their house this way so they don't get overwhelmed with responsibility. So many people just abandon animals later because they can't manage. It's not easy and definitely a lot of work. You are going in the best way possible keeping the animals interest at heart and not selfishly wanting to show off.", "You said this better than I could, but I agree wholeheartedly, especially the part about OP\u2019s son getting Gizzy once he\u2019s in an appropriate environment. That shows OP isn\u2019t trying to \u201cown\u201d Gizzy but just looking out for him.\n\nNTA", "I have 5 sons. He's being truthful lmao.", "I came here to say this! I have lived with many stoners over the years and it is a STRUGGLE to keep them from smoking weed around my snakes. some of my roommates even gave their cat asthma from smoking too much with the cat in the room. my current roommate's cat is already asthmatic and I'm expected to take many precautions around her but he still gives me a hard time when I'm mad that he smokes out the window next to my snakes all day. not to mention various roommates \"accidentally\" unplugging their heat lamps, turning the switch off, leaving the window open in the winter, etc....", "Yeah I was concerned about this too, but OP mentioned in another comment that Gizzy is free to go where there sunlight so they can sunbath.\n\nOne of the most common problems we see with people that decide to get a reptile as a pet is that they dont know reptiles are ectotherms, and just get a aquarium with a light right in the middle. Thats terrible for these animals.", "OMG that's terrible, the poor thing!! Hope it got a better home after.\n\nBut yeah, we have that problem with basically every pet. There was a case of a woman who bought a ton of exotic animals illegally, from birds to turtles. She instructed her maids to just feed all the animals with cheap sausages.\n\nI also had to fight a friend that made her dog obese by feeding her all kinds of craps. And when I told her that certain things she gave the dog like grapes and chocolate,  are highly toxic to dogs, her response was \"but she likes it!\"\n\nSometimes I feel like people should have a permission to be able to own a pet.", "I disagree. My turtles react to their names, play with their toys, \"ask\" to bop their noses etc. Reptiles may be calmer than typical pet, but they have their own kind of charm", "And it\u2019s not even just guys, I stayed in a girls only apartment and it still was a war zone. Especially the bathroom. It\u2019s like a rite of passage for college kids to live in a complete mess lol", "\"Ask\" to bop their noses. Tremendous. I don't doubt it for a minute either \ud83d\ude02", "...sounds like distressed squeals to me. That it starts before it hits the water and ends when the animal can no longer struggle doesn't help much...", "When in mood for some nose-rubbing, they stand taller on their front legs and stretch their necks, then kinda hiss, all while looking pleadingly at me. It never gets old", "Well, except lobsters don't vocalize.  They don't even have the parts to vocalize.", "If you're holding a lit match in your hand, you don't throw it into the forest *and then* call the fire department.  *you blow out the match*.  The father just blew out the match.", "Or, when someone is standing there with a pile of firewood and is asking *you* to light the match and toss it to them, you can call up the fire department to give a presentation about why you don't throw lit matches into a forest since the person you're trying to explain that to doesn't seem to want to listen when *you* say it.\n\nThe match isn't on fire.\n\nHe didn't blow out the match.\n\nHe just took the matches away. Like you would with a child who is incapable of understanding the consequences of their own actions.\n\nThat is not the proper way to treat a 20 year old who has no otherwise known mental capability issues. Especially when you were the one responsible for raising that 20 year old in the first place.\n\n*And* that *assumes* he's right and there *is* an issue with the lizard living there.\n\nIf he's right, let a third party expert prove it. That's what you would *have* to do if anyone but his son was acting this way. So why is he treating his son different and intentionally like a child?\n\nThat's the entire point."]}
