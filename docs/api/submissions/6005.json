I know he\u2019s yours and you care about him but you have to see that what you\u2019d be taking him to would be smaller and more chaotic.\u201d\n\nMake it clear that, once time passes and he has a better setup, he can come get him.  \n\nYou also need to realize that any place he lives will likely never be as nice as what you have now\u2014accept that it doesn\u2019t need to be as good as your place but can certainly be a step up from trashed frat house.", "NTA in any way. You are advocating for a voiceless creature, and you are doing the right thing.", "NTA\n\nAs a graduated biologist specialized in animal welfare, I can say that you are in the right here.\n\nThe iguana is not a domesticated animal, and it's a sentient being, with feelings and capable of feeling stress and pain, even if they dont show it the same way we do. You son seems to be treating Gizzy as a trophy or an object to show off. If he truly cares about him, he will consider whats best for Gizzy and not whats best for himself. A big change in routine and ambient can be extremely stressful to any animal.\n\nThat aside, I do want to point something out:\n\n*\"That lizard lives a life better than most people. He has full range of the house, has meals worthy of fancy restaurants, lots of attention and a large vivarium\"*\n\nBe careful with this mentality. Treating an animal like a human does not equal to treating it better or correctly. Do not give human fancy foods to an iguana. I just wanted to make this clear because we have to deal with tons of cases of animals who are treated badly, on good intentions and wrongful assumption of their needs based on humans needs and emotions.\n\nI do have the impression that you know what you are doing and researched how to deal with a pet iguana, but I just wanted to make sure.\n\nIn any case, I would put my foot down on this. If your son is treating Gizzy as an object without any respect to his well being, then he doesn't deserve to have it. Sit down and explain to your son how moving to a smaller place could affect Gizzy. If he doesn't care, then just tell him to get a plush iguana.", "NTA.

Super high care needs and maintenance. It seems like you\u2019ve got a good set up going for him now so it absolutely makes sense that you don\u2019t want to mess with that. He\u2019s likely to be forgotten about and neglected in a college apartment. You\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for the animal and that\u2019s what matters most", "NTA at all. Animals do not handle moving well at all for the most part. Especially if the new place is going to be apples to oranges what they're used to.\n\nAnd I think it's adorable. The first part of your post sounded like \"what were we thinking getting this stupid lizard\"\n\nThen he goes to college and the truth comes out. Gizzy got a special place in your heart, and poppa bear protection comes out in the end lol\n\nBut like someone else said, talk to your son and make him understand why it has to be this way. He's probably just thinking your being mean and don't want to lose the lizard.", "NTA\nTell him he can have Gizzy when he can provide an equal lifestyle to the one Gizzy has with you.", "NTA while it is still his pet, it would be cruel to move him from his home. Especially to a temporary dwelling with people that Gizzy doesn't know", "NTA. Maybe try to make sure your son knows he can have Gizzy when he doesn't live in a frat house.", "Nta. You're thinking of Gizzy and his quality of life. Iguanas are not easy pets and require specific needs and plenty of room. Your approach could've been better though, Gizzy is still your sons pet but he can't live in a college apartment with him. Its too drastic of a change and there's too much that could go wrong even in the cleanest driest college apartment. I have a 16 year old turtle(Tobi) that might outlive me at this point. I finally moved out of my moms this spring. (Im 25, not in college anymore, working 2 jobs) Tobi still lives at my moms cause he's been in the same tank and same place for 16 years and thriving like that. while I do have the space and landlord permission to move Tobi here if id like, I love and care way too much about him to risk him dying from transportation, stress from new environment, or something as little as a ph imbalance. Reptiles in general are not beginner pets and often die or suffer abuse at the hands of people who just want a cool novelty pet but arent educated and prepared enough to care for it. Reptile vets are another huge obstacle if something were to happen. Thank you for caring about Gizzys wellbeing.", "NTA The needs of the animal that cannot speak for itself come before the feelings of a 20 year old living in a 'frat' house.", "More info needed:\n\n1. Would your son be taking the vivarium with him? Is there room? If not, what is his living plan for the pet?\n\n2. Why do you mention your yard? Do iguana usually go out in a yard?

Lol.", "i\u2019ve lived with 3 guys in an apartment before and the smell from the kitchen alone would be enough to knock an elephant out. iguanas need plenty of space and can be very temperamental, so taking it from a quiet and clean environment where it\u2019s well taken care of to a cramped apartment with 2 other people and maybe more pets would end badly.", "I agree. It really sounds like the dad is skewing the narrative.  Especially since the wife disagrees", "If animal control gets involved, that lizard is almost certainly getting put down. A full grown iguana is very hard to rehome, hence why there are so many wild iguanas in Florida; people can\u2019t care for them and release them into the wild. Iguanas have super specific needs and are temperamental so animal control isn\u2019t going to be able to spend resources keeping it indefinitely. I think this is more about what\u2019s best for the lizard.", "That's how I feel about reptiles period. But try telling that to a reptile person lol. \n\nWhat about spider people?

Are you seriously comparing three guys in an apartment to 40 guys in a frat house? Wow.", "So? You think the pet owner would put his pet in danger?", "Yeah, I think the iguana is a substitute for the son. I get it, but dad really needs to let go.", ">I think this is more about what\u2019s best for the lizard.\n\nExactly why animal control is the arbitrator for this purpose.\n\nIt's basically solomon's choice.\n\nOr take it to a pet custody court, if you feel they make a better arbitrator.\n\nEither way, the key point is he should be treating his adult child like an adult and not a child. He should handle this dispute the same way he would with any other adult.", "No, I didn't \"compare\" it, you did. But I certainly don't think it's the complete opposite of a frat house.\n\nMy sister lived in an off campus apartment with 3 other girls. Yea, it wasn't as bad as a sorority house. But there was ALWAYS a solid +5 people in an out, drinking parties several times weekly, dirty laundry all over the place, etc. Yea they kept it in better shape than a frat house, but it was by no means quality conditions for an animal.\n\nJust the amount of constant random people alone would be high stress for an animal.\n\nSo again, college kids in an apartment is not the anti-thesis to a frat house. The lizards current home with Pop is.", "yes by moving the iguana into the apartment. iguanas need plenty of space because they can grow to be pretty big and can sometimes get more aggressive with age. suddenly moving a pet without letting them get accustomed to the new environment can end really bad. worst case scenario is he ends up releasing the iguana into wild because rehoming them, especially when they\u2019re grown, is extremely difficult because they require different care than other pets.", "I asked and he said the son would be downgrading the Pet's space to move with him, so I agree with the dad. Still he's being probably too harsh on it being a party house. Untidy is not the same", "You might be able to argue that as an adult, the son needs to make his own choices, and learn from his own mistakes.

For all we know the lizard will be just fine in 'lesser' living conditions.\n\nAsk your question again but then ask: Who gets to define it's an unsafe home? You do? Why?\n\nIf a parent of a child was living in a mansion, with that child, and then moved out to live in a much more impoverished location, would you deny the parent their child just because the living situation isn't as good?\n\nIf you truly believe the living situation is unsafe, *prove that to an objective, informed, applicable third party*. That was my point. Either you're right or you're not.\n\nAs much as we all love AITA, it is not a true applicable third party. Not when a lizard's life is on the line.\n\n\\~\n\nI may have simplified it down to just 'call animal control' but let me offer a more practical detailed suggestion: Conference call the kid and someone from animal control, explain the situation, and ask animal control to confirm whether or not transferring the lizard would be abuse to the lizard to do so. If the person from animal control needs more information to make that determination, give it to them. And then you both abide by that determination.\n\nOr if you can't get animal control to do it, then that's what pet custody court is for.\n\nSame thing you'd do if it was some adult trying to claim ownership of a pet you don't feel they deserve. That was my point all along; the OP is making this decision *for* their child one-sidedly when they don't get to do that if it's any other adult. \"Because I said so\" stopped being allowed the moment their child grew up. He needs to find another way to resolve this, and what better way than an objective, informed, expert third party arbitrator?", "Again, you're putting words in my mouth. You're the one making all the assumptions here. OP literally said\n\n\"I've been to their place and it looks like a bunch of 10yo's live there\"\n\nSo outside of his own words explaining their situation, which lines up wih my thoughts, College kids keeping a tidy and sanitary home while living on their own is not the social norm. Seriously trying to pretend otherwise is laughable.", "LOL. Ok.", "Yes. Very LOL when someone is shown they're wrong and refuses to acknowledge it.\n\nEnjoy your day"]}
