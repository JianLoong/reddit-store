Met when I was 21. Together almost 8 years. Six months into our relationship, his father got diagnosed with ALS and for the last 7 years (he died 4 months ago) we watched him die slowly. It was agonizing for everyone involved. Literally the worst thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed. I fed him, bathed him, cared for him, watched the emts come to our house after he fell over and over again. I watched him gasp for air in his last breaths. We all lived together. I can\u2019t even remember most of my 20\u2019s because I was so immersed in his fathers illness and taking care of him. I\u2019m so fucked up from it. My boyfriend is too but has since moved on and was happy for the first time in a long long time. Once he died it\u2019s as if a veil was lifted. \n\nI\u2019m a tattoo artist and work more than 12 hours a day with drawing/tattooing. I haven\u2019t been able to breathe for the past 8 years with the ALS and my job and every other thing. The stress is more than I can take. I\u2019ve been by my boyfriends side through it all being as supportive as I can. \n\n4 years ago my boyfriend got diverticulitis and almost died. I had to feed him and change his colostomy bag and I quit my job to help him and his father. I did this because I wanted to. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been 4 months since the death of his father. 1 year ago I planned a solo backpacking trip to Thailand next month. I need this so badly. I need to breathe. It\u2019s been a fucking rough go and after taking care of everyone but myself for so long, in my heart I need this. \n\n\n2 weeks ago my boyfriends best friend died unexpectedly from an overdose. It was heart shattering. I can\u2019t believe it. My boyfriend is crushed and it\u2019s just so fucking unfair that all of these horrible things have happened to him. I\u2019m heartbroken for him. I\u2019m trying so hard to be there and help him while he grieves. \n\nI\u2019ve stayed by his side every moment throughout all of this heart ache. I\u2019ve forgotten about my own family and my own hearts desires. I feel like a shell and I\u2019m spent. \n\nI\u2019m set to fly to Thailand for a month, I leave in a week and a half. I feel guilty. I feel like my duty has been and always will be is to cater to him and leave my needs to get to when I get to them. I\u2019m almost run out. I\u2019m fucking tired and I need a break. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I need to be there for him as I always have. \n\nHe\u2019s so scared of me going away and dying. I\u2019m trying to explain to him why I need this. He doesn\u2019t understand the idea of backpacking especially solo. He says he\u2019s ok with me leaving but I don\u2019t believe him. He knows how much I\u2019ve helped him. I\u2019ve been his backbone for so long. He says he\u2019s succumbed to the prospect of me leaving but a part of me thinks he won\u2019t be ok without me even though he says he will.\n\nBeing away I believe will make us stronger but I cannot shake this guilty feeling.\n\nAm I the asshole for leaving?", "created_utc": 1669176561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2ew4i/aita_for_going_on_my_solo_backpacking_trip_2/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've gone above and beyond for this man and his family, giving up what I would argue are some of the best years of your life by caring for him and his father - it speaks a lot to his character if he tries to take this from you too. Yes, it was your choice to do those things, but you were a 21 year old girl. He would benefit from seeing and talking this out with a professional about his fears around death but that is not your responsibility to fix. You are not selfish for wanting to go.

Emotionally and physically.\n\nYou have been there for him.  And for his dad.  And for him.  You are an incredibly generous person.

It's hard to break a pattern, that's why you feel guilty and don't want to leave, but believe me you have to go and do this for yourself to break the pattern... Otherwise at some point you will be mad at yourself, or other people when they won't put you first like you did for them... And it will eventually shatter you, so go and do this trip and try to rest!", "NTA. You have caretaker burnout. You have spent almost a third of your life taking care of other people.

You *know* you matter, and how you feel matters.  You know you need this - you say so quite plainly.  We all make sacrifices for the ones we love.

Draw lines where you need them, and those who love you will respect them.

You need a life too and shouldn't feel guilty. Pretty similar to you, my husband got cancer and my mother had a terminal illness. My husband is 100% good now, but I lost 10 of the best years of my life. I don't regret it, but I do regret not making myself a priority also. I was so focused on making sure they were ok and doing all the things our insurance wouldn't cover...i just lost myself. After my mother died, my MIL called and informed me I did such a great job taking care of my Mom, she knew I would do the same for her. I was floored and too exhausted to handle anything. Best decision I ever made was to refuse and took time for myself. She got by just fine and I am stronger now and learned to care for myself. Go and recover. Your boyfriend will be fine and honestly, he probably needs to learn to handle his emotions and life on his own in a healthy way. You both probably need time to get your individual identities back and will be better in the long run.", "NTA don\u2019t wear necklaces and put your leg through the strap of your backpack when it\u2019s on the ground. Take a business card of each place you stay so tuktuk drivers can take you home even if you can\u2019t communicate. Get in the rhythm of putting on sunblock in the morning and at lunchtime. Have so much damn fun! While you have distance think about your relationship deeply. If you sacrifice all that you are for others then what is left of you. It\u2019s ok to prioritize yourself even when there is a crisis going on. Do not place the burdens of duty upon yourself. If he is the right guy then you will be the girlfriend he wants, not a list of duties that he expects is fulfilled. It will only cause resentment even if the list is created in your own mind", "NTA. That\u2019s a lot to go through in so little time. So sorry for your losses. Second of all, you need to take care of yourself too. You\u2019ve put everyone\u2019s needs in front of your own, and you need to take care of you now.

Go, and let yourself enjoy every minute of it.", "NTA. Take some you time, it is way overdue", "NTA you deserve a break and this is something you\u2019ve had planned for a long time. You\u2019ve already done so much and you can\u2019t keep going like this forever. Your boyfriend needs to see someone for grief counseling or a support group.

It is fair that you have a period of time where you have enough time to relax that you get bored because I really doubt you have had any time not working either in your professional career or as an unpaid carer, where you are not reassuring people or dealing with crises or secondary trauma. You have found a rope and need to remember that your health is just as important as anyone's before you end up crippled. \n\nYou are a champion and deserve all respect but you are a dummy if you are questioning if not turning crispy from burn out makes you a bad person.
