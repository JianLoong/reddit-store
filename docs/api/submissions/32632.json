Anyone who would cause a possible stressful or hostile environment should not be invited. While your families are involved, they cannot be the major focus of your plans/hopes. Bottom line, you do you. You do what\u2019s right for your happiness on that special occasion. The rest can take hindmost. (If you are footing the bill, especially so).", "NTA and i personally dont get people giving you crap for inviting your sisters ex.\nHe was in your life for over a decade and you saw him as a brother.\nHonestly with how little value your sister places on wedding vows i might even reconsider her invite but i get why that would cause issues.\nGood luck and have a great wedding", "NTA.  Typically, I would suggest you need to include the BF after three years of their being together, BUT upon reading some of your later comments in response to others, it appears you cannot be sure of his behavior towards your sister's ex-husband, and you do NOT want that sort of drama at your wedding.  It's unfortunate that you feel this way, but sounds like you have some good reason to feel you need to exclude him.  I'd tell your sister exactly this and she can accept or not accept your rationale even though she *must* accept your and your fianc\u00e9's decision on this matter.", "INFO: How long have they been divorced?", "NTA, you can invite who you want to your wedding, esp if the groom doesn't want him either. But, you'll have to accept that it will create a rift between you and your sister.", "NTA. I don't want to invite someone in my wedding whom I don't feel comfortable.", "NTA, and after reading some of your responses, I wouldn't want this boyfriend within a hundred miles of me much less at my wedding. It definitely seems like your sister's kind of still husband is not the only reason you don't want him there, so just list of those reasons in a text and tell her it's not happening. The BIL seems like a really mature guy comparatively speaking, considering he's seven years younger than this toolbag your sisters with now. Also your mam should kind of realise that your wedding is not a time for compromise, it's wholly your decision you just kind of have to live with the consequences and if she doesn't want to cone over it then you'll honestly be better of without her there. She's your sister at the end of the day, but she's a cheater, and that's a scummy kind of person.", "NTA - it's your wedding. You invite who you want to invite. You don't have to invite a total stranger simply because he is dating your sister. How long have they been together for anyways?", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding you can invite who u please", "NTA\n\nNormally I hate all these AITA-questions asked by brides about their weddings. Hate them, hate them, hate them.\n\nThese women are always selfish, unreasonable and batshit crazy.\n\nYour story is simple as can be.\nIt's your and your soon-to-be husband's wedding. You decide, who you want to invite or not. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with not wanting to have strangers at your wedding. There is nothing wrong with not wanting your good friend having to meet the guy his ex cheated on him with.\nAs as matter of fact, everything else would be weird.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding. She\u2019ll just have to deal. Is your BIL bringing a +1?", "Your wedding.... but\n\nBut she is NTA if she decides not to come.\n\nPersonally I would invite him and set firm ground rules... and expect 30 yo's to act like grown ups and be civil.\n\nAlso, did you ask her Ex what he thought?  Maybe he doesn't care.  Why assume how he feels about it... especially if it's been 10 years.", "Objectively you are NTA. However, if I think about what I would do in your situation, I can\u2019t understand how you\u2019d risk your relationship with your sister for her husband that you know less than your sister. I might totally be projecting here! I have a sister and if she was planning a divorce with her husband (regardless of how that happened) I\u2019m gonna be on my sister\u2019s side. To avoid the drama, I would invite her to the wedding and I wouldn\u2019t send an invite to her soon to be ex husband. But then again, I might be projecting. I have a pretty good relationship with my sister.", "NTA. This is your event. You have invited who you want in attendance. Your sister is now coming up against with the results of her actions because they affected a lot more than just her and her ex husband. You may not get the choice about being estranged from your sister unfortunately. \n\nCongratulations on your big day!", "**NTA** OP, it's *your* (and your fianc\u00e9's) wedding. You get to decide the guest list, I wouldn't want the guy who cheated with your pseudo brother's ex there either.\n\nIt was her decision to cheat, it's your decision not to invite the cheat partner.", "NTA. You have your reasons to not invite him and to invite the ex. It's your sister's decision to come to the wedding herself or complain to others about it. Even your fiance wants the ex over the new bf. You need to tell your sister and your mom that it's your wedding and you can invite and not invite whoever you want to and they either deal with it or not go if that's their choice. They have no say on who is invited.", "It's your choice (and your fianc\u00e9's) who you invite to your wedding. You said that you want \"lots of family\" there, and that's totally fine. I absolutely understand that your sister's ex-husband has become part of your family over the years - and that he's even like a brother to you. Ask yourself: Why should I invite someone to my wedding, who (1) I don't know and (2) has caused a lot of pain to a family member? There is no reason for you to do so.\n\nCould it be that your sister wants to use your wedding to introduce her new boyfriend to the family...? Think about it.\n\nSo NTA.", "NAH - It's your wedding so you can invite or not invite who you want. But your sister isn't an asshole to expect her BF to be a plus one at a wedding.  \n\nI have a hard time believing that you didn't expect this to cause any drama. And if I were you I would prepare for an estrangement. You are basically telling you sister that you value her ex more than you value your relationship with her. She's not going to have warm and fuzzy feelings toward you after that.", "ESH.  Your sister has no say in who attends your wedding.  However, I personally wouldn't have invited her ex or her current boyfriend.  You cannot be surprised that this has created drama.", "Seems like a really strange hill to die on. \n\nWho cares?  He\u2019ll keep your sister occupied. \n\nDo whatever you want though.", "I think the ex-husband is a small bit of an AH because he probably should have sent  a \"no thank you\" RSVP - just to avoid this kind of thing.", "ESH - the approval for all plus ones is just\u2026 odd.\n\nSo she cheated, but she\u2019s still together 2+ years later with him. Either learn to let it go, or stop inviting your sister.", "Yta. \n\nWhat your sister does is her business. If you invited other guests with a plus one then that means your sister too. What happened in her relationship is between her and her ex/soon to be ex. But still invite her ex because you want to. That\u2019s fine. Warn them no drama. \n\nI would make them give 500 deposit just in case they do something stupid.", "Is she the only single person who is an adult who didn't get a plus one?  Does her ex get a plus one?\n\nIf she is being singled out then Y T A, even though you can invite who you want.  If not, then you are not.\n\nIn her place, I would probably not raise a stink, but probably wouldn't attend.", "YTA To not give your 30 y/o sister a +1 then invite her ex??  Wtf... Wow, you must really hate her.  Just zero consideration and respect for the poor girl.", "YTA - YOU have already decided to make it 'uncomfortable' by inviting her Ex to be at the wedding.  YOU are trying to punish your sister, straight out, for her affair, and disguising the reason.  You should apologize and give your sister a plus 1.", "YTA. Sister is different than a friend or whatever. Core family should get a +1 IMHO.\n\nInviting your sisters ex also seems unreasonable. Even if you\u2019re still close I\u2019d assume he would understand if you told him, you would like him there but it would create an uncomfortable dynamic.\n\nNo matter the backstory, you\u2019re signaling your sister that you value the ex more than her and don\u2019t respect her choices (no matter how bad they might have been)\n\nWhipping out the ex at your wedding and not allowing her new bf signals to everyone at the wedding that you see her as the person in the wrong of that prior relationship. Might be correct, but doesn\u2019t need to broadcasted like that.", "Do whatever you want for your wedding, but don't expect your relationship with your sister, and your likely new brother-in-law, to ever be the same.    You chose the ex-husband, which is your right of course.   But you have to know how this hurts her.", "nta you don\u2019t know the guy but yta for inviting her ex husband that she cheated on lol", "I would say ESH if not for the fact that you are very close with her ex and don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't want this guy there.

We text each other, and when I started dating my current partner he was very supportive and met him multiple times. I think because my family was disappointed with my sister they didn\u2019t want to meet her boyfriend, so she didn\u2019t want to meet mine until we got engaged. I can understand that frustration on her and I think now I\u2019m less frustrated about the cheating.
