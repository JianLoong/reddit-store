Typically, I would suggest you need to include the BF after three years of their being together, BUT upon reading some of your later comments in response to others, it appears you cannot be sure of his behavior towards your sister's ex-husband, and you do NOT want that sort of drama at your wedding.  It's unfortunate that you feel this way, but sounds like you have some good reason to feel you need to exclude him.  I'd tell your sister exactly this and she can accept or not accept your rationale even though she *must* accept your and your fianc\u00e9's decision on this matter.", "INFO: How long have they been divorced?", "NTA, you can invite who you want to your wedding, esp if the groom doesn't want him either.

It definitely seems like your sister's kind of still husband is not the only reason you don't want him there, so just list of those reasons in a text and tell her it's not happening. The BIL seems like a really mature guy comparatively speaking, considering he's seven years younger than this toolbag your sisters with now. Also your mam should kind of realise that your wedding is not a time for compromise, it's wholly your decision you just kind of have to live with the consequences and if she doesn't want to cone over it then you'll honestly be better of without her there. She's your sister at the end of the day, but she's a cheater, and that's a scummy kind of person.", "NTA - it's your wedding. You invite who you want to invite.

I have a pretty good relationship with my sister.", "NTA. This is your event. You have invited who you want in attendance.

You get to decide the guest list, I wouldn't want the guy who cheated with your pseudo brother's ex there either.\n\nIt was her decision to cheat, it's your decision not to invite the cheat partner.", "NTA. You have your reasons to not invite him and to invite the ex. It's your sister's decision to come to the wedding herself or complain to others about it. Even your fiance wants the ex over the new bf. You need to tell your sister and your mom that it's your wedding and you can invite and not invite whoever you want to and they either deal with it or not go if that's their choice. They have no say on who is invited.", "It's your choice (and your fianc\u00e9's) who you invite to your wedding. You said that you want \"lots of family\" there, and that's totally fine. I absolutely understand that your sister's ex-husband has become part of your family over the years - and that he's even like a brother to you. Ask yourself: Why should I invite someone to my wedding, who (1) I don't know and (2) has caused a lot of pain to a family member? There is no reason for you to do so.\n\nCould it be that your sister wants to use your wedding to introduce her new boyfriend to the family...? Think about it.\n\nSo NTA.", "NAH - It's your wedding so you can invite or not invite who you want. But your sister isn't an asshole to expect her BF to be a plus one at a wedding.  \n\nI have a hard time believing that you didn't expect this to cause any drama. And if I were you I would prepare for an estrangement. You are basically telling you sister that you value her ex more than you value your relationship with her. She's not going to have warm and fuzzy feelings toward you after that.", "ESH.  Your sister has no say in who attends your wedding.  However, I personally wouldn't have invited her ex or her current boyfriend.  You cannot be surprised that this has created drama.", "Seems like a really strange hill to die on. \n\nWho cares?  He\u2019ll keep your sister occupied. \n\nDo whatever you want though.", "I think the ex-husband is a small bit of an AH because he probably should have sent  a \"no thank you\" RSVP - just to avoid this kind of thing.", "ESH - the approval for all plus ones is just\u2026 odd.\n\nSo she cheated, but she\u2019s still together 2+ years later with him. Either learn to let it go, or stop inviting your sister.", "Yta. \n\nWhat your sister does is her business. If you invited other guests with a plus one then that means your sister too. What happened in her relationship is between her and her ex/soon to be ex. But still invite her ex because you want to. That\u2019s fine. Warn them no drama. \n\nI would make them give 500 deposit just in case they do something stupid.", "Is she the only single person who is an adult who didn't get a plus one?

If not, then you are not.\n\nIn her place, I would probably not raise a stink, but probably wouldn't attend.", "YTA To not give your 30 y/o sister a +1 then invite her ex??  Wtf... Wow, you must really hate her.  Just zero consideration and respect for the poor girl.", "YTA - YOU have already decided to make it 'uncomfortable' by inviting her Ex to be at the wedding.  YOU are trying to punish your sister, straight out, for her affair, and disguising the reason.  You should apologize and give your sister a plus 1.", "YTA. Sister is different than a friend or whatever. Core family should get a +1 IMHO.\n\nInviting your sisters ex also seems unreasonable. Even if you\u2019re still close I\u2019d assume he would understand if you told him, you would like him there but it would create an uncomfortable dynamic.\n\nNo matter the backstory, you\u2019re signaling your sister that you value the ex more than her and don\u2019t respect her choices (no matter how bad they might have been)\n\nWhipping out the ex at your wedding and not allowing her new bf signals to everyone at the wedding that you see her as the person in the wrong of that prior relationship.

I thought about maybe inviting him to the reception but I don\u2019t want drama there either", "She\u2019s doing interviews of guests to get this\u2026 get to know them better!! Zoom interviews lol", "A deposit actually isn\u2019t a bad idea.", "I think you missed my other comments when I said I watch her kids every weekday for free and she doesn\u2019t take care of them. She doesn\u2019t get them to school on time, she doesn\u2019t feed them anything but fast food, and she doesn\u2019t have them do their homework. I\u2019m the one feeding her kids meals and getting them to do their homework. She also can\u2019t stay at \u201ctheir\u201d house when he\u2019s not there. There\u2019s more to it than me \u201cjudging\u201d her for cheating. My BIL has been in my life since I was barely a teenager. He means a lot to me.", "I can see how approvals for plus ones can be odd. I was hesitant when my fianc\u00e9 suggested it but we thought it was best after how our families can be.", "If you sister keeps pushing, what I would do is go right to her BF and lay out the situation. That you're close to sis's ex, you still consider the ex family and you do not consider BF to be family. You say that neither you nor your fiance want him at your wedding, but your sister won't let it go. Ask him why he would even WANT to be at a wedding where he wasn't wanted by either bride nor groom. I mean, what's he going to say that doesn't make him look pathetic? Keep on that point - how much fun will either sis or BF have knowing so many people, including the couple having the wedding, find the BF to be a pathetic, cheating loser and wishing he wasn't there.  Anyone who still wants to attend a wedding when its put to them like that only wants to be there to be contrary/cause a disturbance/enjoy their notoriety. Making him (and her) look like more of the AHs. \n\nCongrats btw.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

What are the chances he was much better?\n\nShe\u2019s got 3 kids w the STB-ex and somehow SHE got custody even though she can\u2019t be at the BF\u2019s house when he\u2019s not there and is essentially homeless?!", "None of this is anything that explains why you\u2019re dogging your sister honestly you just keep adding to the fact you\u2019re judgemental over her life and you\u2019re using your wedding to punish her. So it\u2019s clearly deeper and you just shouldn\u2019t invite her to your wedding period it\u2019s very clear you don\u2019t like your sister and her choices this isn\u2019t about the boyfriend though. It\u2019s you having a problem with her as a person. I didn\u2019t miss your comments I saw it all and how much you seem to think the ex husband was perfect enough to be chosen for being at your wedding. Sounds like his parenting with the kids is more your style as well he must be more hands on or not? Why didn\u2019t he taking care of his kids daily if shes allegedly so awful and abandoning them? Wouldn\u2019t he have the custody can\u2019t he feed his children? Why can\u2019t he get the kids to school on time if he\u2019s the father? I can\u2019t imagine Gavin all of these issues and you\u2019ve done nothing but make your sister feel like an outsider gee I wonder why she\u2019s the way she is hmm But again this issue is how you judge your sister not about the boyfriend. You have a weird thing with the ex husband you\u2019re also even more TA than you were before but now like a weird 14 year old who can\u2019t shake a creepy crush on an older man who has clearly groomed you to side with him. Just go get married and cut your sister off once and for all stop watching her kids daily or feeding them if it\u2019s so bad call cps but that\u2019s why there are 2 parents let them figure it out butt out and go start your life with your weirdo judgmental fianc\u00e9! You\u2019re such a drama queen", "I think we\u2019ve all learned through OP comments they\u2019re a controlling person she\u2019s set out to punish her sister and this ex husband has done a real number to groom her since the age of 13\nSo much so she\u2019s stopped being close with her sister and chosen the ex husband the fact the whole family resents her for this is so odd it\u2019s been 3 years she\u2019s still with the same guy! This family is making the sister walk around with a scarlet letter. I can\u2019t imagine being 23 and thinking I know shit about life after kids and marriage enough to give such hell to someone.", "I doubt she\u2019d still be friends with him if she was hurting her. When she told me she was cheating on him, i practically begged her to tell me he was abusive or something. All I got was \u201che\u2019s boring\u201d"]}
