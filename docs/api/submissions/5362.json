{"id": 5362, "submission_id": "zshrs4", "title": "AITA for telling my roommate\u2019s family that I\u2019m not his girlfriend?", "selftext": "For the last year and a half I (29f) have lived in a 2BR apt with a male roommate (27m). We met each other through a mutual friend (27f) who introduced us when I moved to her city and was looking for roommates.\n\nHe happens to be gay. He is out to everyone except his parents/family, who he says would not accept him for it because they are from a  socially conservative country.\n\nAwhile ago he came to me and confessed that he had told his parents I was his girlfriend who he was living with, and asked me if I was ok with that. I was taken aback, but I know about his struggles with his family and he assured me that I would never meet them since they live in a far away country. He said I wouldn\u2019t even hear from them as his parents aren\u2019t really on social media except WhatsApp.\n\nThat was like 8 months ago. A couple weeks ago he springs another surprise on me, and tells me that his aunt (technically his father\u2019s cousin not sister), uncle, and their son who live in his country of origin are on a trip and will be stopping by to visit him for a weekend. He asks if I can tell them I\u2019m his gf because that\u2019s what they believe from his parents. \n\nI was not okay with that. It was one thing when it was some far away strangers, but I didn\u2019t want to lie to his relatives\u2019 face. But he was really persistent about it and said I would only meet them briefly because they were staying in an Airbnb and he would spend most of the weekend taking them around the city.\n\nSo on the day they were arriving, he gives me directions on how to lie to them. He asked me to tell them I\u2019m swamped with work which is why I couldn\u2019t accompany them over the weekend (because I refused to do that) and even to keep the door to my room shut so they wouldn\u2019t know I had my own bedroom.\n\nAs he said, I only met them briefly on Saturday. And on Sunday I was out and didn\u2019t see them again until 8pm when they all unexpectedly came into the apt to say goodbye to me. I was forced to sit with them in the living room and make conversation with them, which was incredibly uncomfortable. Finally, after over an hour they were ready to leave and his aunt suggested we take a group photo.\n\nThat was my breaking point. The idea of a picture of me as his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d being shared with his whole family just seemed so ridiculous and I couldn\u2019t help myself. I blurted out that I was really sorry for lying but I\u2019m actually his roommate not his gf. They were very confused and asked why I said I was and I told them to ask him.\n\nAfter they had left, he was SO pissed at me he was literally shaking. And since then, he\u2019s been giving me the silent treatment and is totally ignoring me. Also, our mutual friend is mad at me too, accusing me of \u201couting\u201d him to his family. I did no such thing, all I did was stop the bullshit.

It's fine that he wasn't ready to tell his family, but it's not ok to coerce someone into lying for you like that.", "Info: when you say \u201csocially conservative country\u201d-are we talking his family might disown him conservative, or do you mean a country where he might be executed by his government for being gay?", "ESH.\n\nYou would have been totally n t a if you had said no.\n\nBut you agreed, went along with it, and then blurted it out in a way that caused a great deal of drama and embarrassment.\n\nHe shouldn't have asked you to lie.\n\nYou shouldn't have agreed.\n\nBut you definitely shouldn't have made the scene you did.", "NTA because he put you under pressure and then the terms of what you agreed to kept getting changed.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA. Your roommate caused himself this problem. Also maybe check what story he told your mutual friend if she thinks you actually outed him.\n\nBut also you were kinda an AH to yourself - trust your feelings when they\u2019re saying you\u2019re not okay with something! And especially don\u2019t override your feelings because someone is being persistent and pushy like that - that\u2019s someone prioritising themselves alone and who doesn\u2019t value you.", "NTA. He made his problems your problems. Plus he isn't even a friend, just a roommate.", "NTA. He started the whole thing by manipulating you into an unwilling lie. On top of that, he then surprised you with them on Sunday night. Not your fault for not playing along perfectly to his script.", "ESH. Him for putting you in this position (especially having already lied about you without your knowledge), but also you a little bit for letting it get that far up until the picture. You knew you weren\u2019t comfortable, you probably should have said a flat out no and stuck to it before the aunt even showed up. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with this, but I would consider finding someone else to live with if I were you. His pestering of you demonstrates a clear lack of respect for your boundaries.", "I mean. You agreed to play along when you could have just set a firm boundary. He clearly has issues and no respectfor your boundaries anyway. His family clearly have issues which is likely why he has issues. You're all assholes in different ways but I'd say you were less of the asshole\n\nTime to move out", "NTA. He broke your trust multiple times. Once by lying to his family without your consent. And again when his weekend plans with his aunt didn\u2019t go according to his plans for one brief encounter. He is using you and needs to grow the fuck up and excommunicate his family (if they choose to not accept his truth) and live his life divorced from his family or - maybe with their acceptance. He hasn\u2019t given them that chance either.", "NTA. The fact that he is angry at *you* when *he* is the one who repeatedly changed the rules is proof that he never intended to respect your boundaries. \n\nIt would have been the easiest thing in the world for him to say that his girlfriend is mad at him because he didn't warn her that his family was coming or that they were going through a rough patch and were taking a break from each other for a few weeks. Heck, if he was worried about them realizing that he was gay, he could have blamed the rough patch on the fact that he cheated with another girl and his girlfriend was making him sleep in the couch until she decided if she would take him back. And if those would have been a perfect excuse for him to refuse to let them meet you or to keep it to that initial meeting...but it would have required that *he* be the bad guy.\n\nBut at the end of the day, he wasn't trying to hide the fact that he was gay, he was trying to prove to them that he was amazing. And he didn't care what impact his lies had on you.\n\nUnless he profusely apologizes and seems genuinely ashamed about the position he put you in, you should probably look into changing your living situation: it's a bad idea to live with someone who is willing to treat you that badly, especially when it was for something as stupid and meaningless as propping up a fake reputation. Even if he does show remorse, he has a *lot* to do to make it up to you", "ESH Because for some reason you agreed to go along with this?? I feel bad for the dude but thats some next level lying. You should have told him no from the get-go.", "NTA it went beyond what you expected and what he had advised you it would be. He put you on the spot by bringing them back because he couldn't handle them himself. \n\nBeing an abstract girlfriend is one thing but family photos? I wouldn't either.\n\nYou're not TA for going along with the lie in the first place. Following the lead of your friend who wasn't out to their family was a reasonable thing to do.\n\nYou also didn't out him. If he wants to make something else up there's still scope, for example he has no intention to find a woman to date seriously at the moment and lied about you due to family pressure. Technically true.", "ESH\n\nHim for putting you in the lie to start, without your consent first. He should have asked first.\n\nYou for agreeing to continue the lie and then abruptly having problems continuing the lie.\n\nThis seems like the plot to a bad Hallmark/Lifetime movie.", "ESH you could just have said that you broke up or let him know long ago that you would not lie about it, you were sorry, but it was stepping over a boundary you were not willing to push. You agreed with it than, agreed with it now and in the last minute you outed him.\n\nHe also should not have used you to cover for him without asking you first. \n\nBoth were AH.", "ESH, him for lying and you for going along with it.", "Look, you agreed to play along with him. You didn't have to. You could have stayed at a friend's house that weekend. But you agreed to play along. And then you violated his trust by saying you were lying. You're totally the asshole here. You should have just left and said, \"I'm sorry, I don't like having my picture taken\" or something, and then they'd think you were some kind of weirdo, but who cares.

She could even say \u201cI only agreed because you said they were not coming here, I\u2019m sorry but I changes the deal and I won\u2019t do it.\u201d Even though she was pressured to do it she could have put her friend on the wall without telling his family it was a lie.

That\u2019s why I think they are both AH.", "Agree with all of this. \n\nAlso\u2026I\u2019m almost certain there are some heterosexual men out there who don\u2019t have girlfriends. Perhaps, next time on Straight Man Dinner Theatre, your roommate can play the part of one of those.", "Completely agree with you here. She did not have to pretend to be the gf. But saying yes and then backing out in front of the family probably caused him a lot bigger issue than if he just told them a different lie from the beginning", "The only answer", "I understand not coming out to the parents, but why must he pretend to have a girlfriend? Single guy does not equal gay. NTA, he shouldn't have asked you to lie.", "Ok so he only asked her permission after he had already told his family about her, which makes her feel guilty as hell if she says no because he'd have to tell them he lied. She obviously wasn't ok with it, but he assured her she'd never have to actually meet them.\n\nThen he surprises her with family she will have to meet. She says no, but he is persuasive as \"persistent\" and talks her into it. She only agrees to the minimum possible time with them, because she's clearly uncomfortable with the whole thing.\n\nIt sounds like coercion to me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f or just emotional blackmail", "She could have said no and just gone away for the weekend to a friend's house.

To coerce someone means to get them to do something they don't want to do by using force or threats. Neither of those happened here.

That definition doesn't support your argument. She wasn't compelled to do it. He asked her to agree to something else and she agreed. Plain and simple. She didn't have to agree to it. No one \"compelled\" her to agree to it. It was her choice. And she's the asshole for breaking what she agreed to, plain and simple.\n\nOK, this is now my last response on this subdebate."]}
