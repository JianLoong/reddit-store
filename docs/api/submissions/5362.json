We met each other through a mutual friend (27f) who introduced us when I moved to her city and was looking for roommates.\n\nHe happens to be gay. He is out to everyone except his parents/family, who he says would not accept him for it because they are from a  socially conservative country.\n\nAwhile ago he came to me and confessed that he had told his parents I was his girlfriend who he was living with, and asked me if I was ok with that. I was taken aback, but I know about his struggles with his family and he assured me that I would never meet them since they live in a far away country. He said I wouldn\u2019t even hear from them as his parents aren\u2019t really on social media except WhatsApp.\n\nThat was like 8 months ago. A couple weeks ago he springs another surprise on me, and tells me that his aunt (technically his father\u2019s cousin not sister), uncle, and their son who live in his country of origin are on a trip and will be stopping by to visit him for a weekend. He asks if I can tell them I\u2019m his gf because that\u2019s what they believe from his parents. \n\nI was not okay with that. It was one thing when it was some far away strangers, but I didn\u2019t want to lie to his relatives\u2019 face. But he was really persistent about it and said I would only meet them briefly because they were staying in an Airbnb and he would spend most of the weekend taking them around the city.\n\nSo on the day they were arriving, he gives me directions on how to lie to them. He asked me to tell them I\u2019m swamped with work which is why I couldn\u2019t accompany them over the weekend (because I refused to do that) and even to keep the door to my room shut so they wouldn\u2019t know I had my own bedroom.\n\nAs he said, I only met them briefly on Saturday. And on Sunday I was out and didn\u2019t see them again until 8pm when they all unexpectedly came into the apt to say goodbye to me. I was forced to sit with them in the living room and make conversation with them, which was incredibly uncomfortable. Finally, after over an hour they were ready to leave and his aunt suggested we take a group photo.\n\nThat was my breaking point. The idea of a picture of me as his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d being shared with his whole family just seemed so ridiculous and I couldn\u2019t help myself. I blurted out that I was really sorry for lying but I\u2019m actually his roommate not his gf. They were very confused and asked why I said I was and I told them to ask him.\n\nAfter they had left, he was SO pissed at me he was literally shaking. And since then, he\u2019s been giving me the silent treatment and is totally ignoring me. Also, our mutual friend is mad at me too, accusing me of \u201couting\u201d him to his family.

Him for putting you in this position (especially having already lied about you without your knowledge), but also you a little bit for letting it get that far up until the picture.

He hasn\u2019t given them that chance either.", "NTA. The fact that he is angry at *you* when *he* is the one who repeatedly changed the rules is proof that he never intended to respect your boundaries. \n\nIt would have been the easiest thing in the world for him to say that his girlfriend is mad at him because he didn't warn her that his family was coming or that they were going through a rough patch and were taking a break from each other for a few weeks. Heck, if he was worried about them realizing that he was gay, he could have blamed the rough patch on the fact that he cheated with another girl and his girlfriend was making him sleep in the couch until she decided if she would take him back. And if those would have been a perfect excuse for him to refuse to let them meet you or to keep it to that initial meeting...but it would have required that *he* be the bad guy.\n\nBut at the end of the day, he wasn't trying to hide the fact that he was gay, he was trying to prove to them that he was amazing. And he didn't care what impact his lies had on you.\n\nUnless he profusely apologizes and seems genuinely ashamed about the position he put you in, you should probably look into changing your living situation: it's a bad idea to live with someone who is willing to treat you that badly, especially when it was for something as stupid and meaningless as propping up a fake reputation. Even if he does show remorse, he has a *lot* to do to make it up to you", "ESH Because for some reason you agreed to go along with this?? I feel bad for the dude but thats some next level lying. You should have told him no from the get-go.", "NTA it went beyond what you expected and what he had advised you it would be. He put you on the spot by bringing them back because he couldn't handle them himself. \n\nBeing an abstract girlfriend is one thing but family photos? I wouldn't either.\n\nYou're not TA for going along with the lie in the first place. Following the lead of your friend who wasn't out to their family was a reasonable thing to do.\n\nYou also didn't out him. If he wants to make something else up there's still scope, for example he has no intention to find a woman to date seriously at the moment and lied about you due to family pressure. Technically true.", "ESH\n\nHim for putting you in the lie to start, without your consent first.

You agreed with it than, agreed with it now and in the last minute you outed him.\n\nHe also should not have used you to cover for him without asking you first. \n\nBoth were AH.", "ESH, him for lying and you for going along with it.", "Look, you agreed to play along with him. You didn't have to. You could have stayed at a friend's house that weekend. But you agreed to play along. And then you violated his trust by saying you were lying. You're totally the asshole here.

A picture wouldn\u2019t have killed you or just refused to take the picture you didn\u2019t have to say you were not his girlfriend.", "nta.\n\nHe *forced* you into a web of lies. He never consulted you for the first lie, and after that, the pressure was on you to keep the lie going because he made it part of your business... it's *very* inconsiderate at best, and *very* manipulative at worst. \n\nAdditionally, single straight men exist so why is there even a point to lie, unless it was an issue of cohabitation? Even then, you aren't married, so... if it's an issue of cohabitation, it doesn't really matter if you're dating or not if you're unmarried.", "nta", "Hey he\u2019s an adult. You\u2019re a roommate. If he wants to stay in the closet and conspire that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s insulting insisting you lie for him.", "She agreed up to the point of meeting them briefly, the suddenly needing to sit with them for an hour and take a picture was not part of what she was told about. She still went with that unexpected thing up to a point, but then decided it went too far at a picture. That is on him for throwing in something he did not clear with her. He shouldn't have let them come back to his place on Sunday. He has no problem lying to them, he could have made something up.", "> you agreed, went along with it, and then blurted it out\n\nBut he did keep moving the goalposts. OP agreed to one meeting. The roommate brought them all back unexpectedly and didn't shut down the photo suggestion. OP never agreed to those. Also, he roped OP into all of this without her consent to begin with. He told the family without asking her. He said she'd never have to meet them, he surprises her with them visiting, all without asking her. \n\nOP went above and beyond under the circumstances.", "I'm so glad this is the top ruling here.  \nThere was a similar situation posted several months ago where the poster had agreed to pretend to be straight at a party with her sister's soon to be in laws. The poster revealed her orientation half way through the party. I got majorly downvoted for saying that poster shared part of the blame for going back on her word.", "Thank you. While I think the roomie was crappy to put her in this position she went along with it then to get all righteous because of a picture? Come on now.", "If OP is the partner of the roommate from a repressive country that puts gays in danger, it's likely it's also a country that puts women in danger. If OP is seen as the partner of the roommate by the family with such views also towards women, and is playing as \"the roommate's woman\", then OP is putting herself in danger to cover for the roommate, who she did not consent to cover for in this way.", "Once again, did you even read the post?  She wasn't there for 90% of the weekend/visit (or in her room).  He didn't \"heavily persuade\" her - he asked her, and she agreed to do it.  She did almost nothing with them or him.\n\nI think you're projecting, you clearly need some help.  But thanks for looking out for me.", "Are you suggesting that members of the roommates family, who have known he\u2019s been living with OP for 8 months, would travel across the world to honor kill OP for living with him or for lying about being his gf?\n\nOr do you think by blowing the cover she immediately put herself in danger? Because one seems improbable considering they already know and the other (the immediate danger) seems like there\u2019s more reason to continue the coverup. Because she\u2019s not from his country so not sure how there is any equivalent danger here. \n\nUltimately I think NTA unless she knew blowing his cover meant he faced legal persecution, including death when he returned home.", "Why should  she leave her home  because  HE lied???!nta op.\n\nEta knowing  how you felt about  lying  he should have found a way to stop the goodbye  meeting from happening.  The picture  was the straw that broke the camel s back.", "Busted. LOL", "No you read better. Changing the terms would be if he said \"I know I said this, but now I'm saying something else.\"\n\nInstead, what he said was, \"would you mind if you did something in addition to what we originally agreed to?\"\n\nHe didn't change the terms. He asked her to agree to additional terms. That's the difference.\n\nI don't know why you're arguing with me. What difference does it make if I disagree with you? Does it personally offend you? Do you have to somehow prove that you're right? Just accept that we disagree and move on.", "YTA do you have any idea what you did? Do you think he wanted you to lie for fun? Do you know what\u2019s going to happen to him because of you? If you didn\u2019t want to do it, you could\u2019ve said no. You told him yes and then you literally were like the worst friend in the world!", "Why is this such a big deal to pretend to be the gf to help protect him from his family. I just don't get all the trash talking and you not willing to help. What am I missing? I'd do this for a friend, np and doesn't seem so earth shattering of a request.", "Okay but you agreed. This could be very dangerous for your roomate if they find out he's gay. Ya YTA - rlly ESH but YTA cuz this can be very bad for roomate and frankly has a more detrimental outcome for him than for you", "SOFT YTA because after you agreed to it, you did in fact out him. You should have never went along with it if you were going to do this at the very end anyway. The reason I\u2019m not going with E S H is because while I agree he shouldn\u2019t ask ppl to lie for him - I\u2019m sympathetic to the type of pressure, fear and anxiety he must have been going through that would drive him to do anything to be safe like asking for a friend to lie for him.\n\nYou should have never agreed to it but once you did, waiting until the very end to out him was cruel imo. Who knows what his family will do now to him and he was not prepared for that blow.", "YTA\u2026. It was a fucking group photo not a wedding surprise. Why the hell couldn\u2019t you be a good friend and just take the photo? Just goes to show how selfish people are", "NTA he pressured you knowing you were uncomfortable. Then made promises he didn\u2019t keep when you compromised on something you were uncomfortable with. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.", "NTA. He literally involved you in his lie and told you after the fact. You agreed to let it slide with certain restrictions. He changed those when his family showed up. Even then he changed the rules. Problem with lies like this is they are hard if not impossible to keep going.", "NTA you should have said no originally but your allowed to change your mind. You aren\u2019t obligated to lie. He\u2019s an idiot who needs to figure out his own life.", "Definitely NTA. She agreed to go along with this because her roommate promised she would only meet the family members briefly. He did not hold up his end of the bargain. I would have done the exact same thing! I don\u2019t believe in lying to people to their face and I would absolutely NOT be comfortable taking a photo! Her roommate could have come up with a different lie that didn\u2019t involve!!!", "ESH. Him for lying, and you for making a scene. You should have just said no.", "YTAx100\n\nAll you had to do was say NO but you purposely went along with the lie and then blurted out when it was not even necessary. You just wanted to be a self righteous prick but came out as an AH.\n\nFor me it was E S H because he lied too but you are YTAx100  atleast he was upfront with you about that lie but you purposely sabotaged him. You suck!", "NTA. He kept pushing your boundaries Every time you moved it for him. When was he going to stop? When his family started expecting children? Or would he ask you to surrogate for him too? \n\nNope. He brought this on himself by lying to his family and trying to force you to be implicit in it.", "ESH \n\nThis guy is trying to use you as a Beard, which isn\u2019t okay in the first place. He shouldn\u2019t have put you in that position.\n\nBUT, you had PLENTY of opportunity to tell him no, you weren\u2019t comfortable for XYZ reasons and just let it happen until, surprise, a situation cropped up out of the expected. Then you blurted it out and blew a cover you agreed to comfortable or not. You\u2019re an adult, stop allowing yourself to be peer pressured into shite situations", "NO, you are NTA, he had NO right to use you as a human sponge to clean up his messy emotional life with his family. Tell your other friend that under NO uncertain circumstances are YOU to be used in a lie to cover for someone else's life lies. SMDH", "What does this have to do with anything?", "Exactly. She sat with them for over an hour and then when they're finally ready to leave she tells them? If she had refused to spend the time with them at all I would get it, but seems ridiculous to spend that much time pretending only to blow it at the last second. She could have refused the picture for other reasons.", "I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with this, but I would consider finding someone else to live with if I were you.", "All of this. OP, I feel so bad for this guy. He should have taken your no, but then you agreed to it and probably made his life a million times harder than it needed to be by \"revealing\" the truth.", "It was a photograph that would be passed among all family members of the roommate. It is sort of like a permanent record.\nShe agreed to a very particular and limited audience. Once the photo would be in social media, OP has no control over the narrative. She did not agree to that. She is certainly not the asshole.", "She could've easily refused to be in the photo without admitting to not be his girlfriend", "There are actually several countries where cohabitation before marriage is socially taboo but not illegal. These same countries make homosexuality a crime.", "I thought it was pretty obvious. If you know that someone might be executed for being gay if it becomes known and they ask you for cover, you cover.\nIf the conservative family lives in Jamaica and the worst that will happen is they have to move, the moral dilemma is less impactful.", "Also he told his family she was his girlfriend *without asking her if it was okay first*. This is definitely not an ask for forgiveness not permission situation. If my gay roommate *asked* if he could tell his conservative family I was his gf you betcha wanna go take some gross straight people pics for extra convincing? (Likely worth noting i am a straight woman, but if my gay roommate had asked me that that would pretty much verbatim be my response). But out of the blue telling me with no way to opt out? No that's not okay.", "Yes, it seems like the people posting ESH, YTA don't understand YOU DON'T GET TO USE SOMEONE ELSE AS A PROP IN YOUR LIFE. Then, things continue to change without her knowledge or consent. To all you people posting that she was wrong YOU ARE ALL WRONG. He used her in a lie **WITHOUT** her **knowledge**,  (*he came to me and confessed that he had told his parents I was his girlfriend who he was living with*) when he approached her about it, it was a done deal; so how the HELL is this on her? Are the bulk of the people on this thread really that stupid?", "He didn't clear ANY of it with her... *he came to me and confessed that he had told his parents I was his girlfriend who he was living with,* so when he spoke to her about the original lie HE HAD ALREADY TOLD IT.", "My disagreement stems from them only facing consequences if they go back to their native country, which is something they don\u2019t have to do and frankly shouldn\u2019t. So why should someone be compelled to lie, against their wishes, if there are practically are no consequences? Why should I go against my principles to cover for someone else\u2019s lies?", "What makes you think they don\u2019t have to go ever back to their country? There\u2019s no mention of their immigration status."]}
