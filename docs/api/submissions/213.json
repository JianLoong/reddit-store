One of the girls in the group is under 21 so it hard for us to go to bars/clubs without making her feel left out. On the 29th one of my favorite bars was doing a Halloween event that seemed like fun. So I suggested that on Friday we would go to house parties so everyone could go together then on Saturday we would go to the bars It seemed like a win win. \n\nleading up to Halloweekend I noticed that a party flyer was going around. It was a party hosted by the girl who is under 21. I only found out about the party because I seen the flyer posted on someone instagram story. Nobody told me about it. \n\n\nOn the 27th I asked the group what was the plan for Saturday. I gave them the opportunity to bring up the party but nothing. Later that night I got left alone with the party host girl. She was talking about the party and I said I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019m  are going cause Im going to the bars. She said I should stop by and insisted I go. \n\n28th we were supposed to start at 8 I called them and they were still getting ready. 8 turn to 9 then 9 turn to 10 and I got no updates so I called again. I felt so embarrassed. When 11 hit I decided to go out somewhere else until they were ready. I only stayed for 30 minutes when they finally said they were ready and sent me the address to meet them. we were 3 hours late so it didn\u2019t seem to be still going. My friend was already drunk and the girls in the group were openly judging her. I helped her then I came back to the group and they started talking about the plans for the 29th. They said \u201cso we were thinking we could come for two hours then leave and go to her party\u201d  weren\u2019t including me in the plans. It seems like they already had this plan set and weren\u2019t asking me they were telling me what was going to happen. I felt so excluded so I just left. \n\n29th hit I didn\u2019t hear from anyone. They called my friend but not me to talk about the plans. Still excluding us from the house party plans. They didn't message me once which was weird. My friend from home got uncomfortable being the middle man so she lied to text me. They didn\u2019t text me until two hours before the bar event started Saying that one didn\u2019t get a ticket yet and someone else wanted to go but didn\u2019t know if they were still selling tickets. Excuses. \n\nWhen it was time to go they said to go without them because they were still getting ready. I told them no rush because but they insisted on riding separately. I asked them later if they were there yet and she told me they weren\u2019t going and that they were at the house party.\n\nThe 30th they called me and I didn\u2019t pick up I was still pissed and hangover. I had a good night still but it made me mad had they was still acting like everything was fine. \n\nSo AITA if I never speak to them again?", "created_utc": 1667249375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yioisd/aita_for_not_responding_after_being_treated_badly/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Y\u2019all planned on a event and they didn\u2019t show up till it was over and some were already drunk. When my friends and I did a bar crawl we all got ready together and went together they insisted on going separately because their plan never included you. \nNo one is the ah I guess because y\u2019all might not be that close as friends and just last minute friends idk and if you talked to them and they dismiss your feelings then sure cut them off but if you don\u2019t talk to them, you\u2019ll never know", "Jfc I can't believe I just read the whole of that twaddle. \n\nESH.", "I'm going to say NAH. It sounds like your friends are not the best at communicating, but they did update you on the plans (albeit later than you were expecting) and you were still invited to go along with everything they were doing. If anything, it sounds like you're a bit controlling and got salty because things didn't go according to what you wanted.", "NTA, but why are you friends with people like this? Sounds like drunk friends are the extent of who they are. I'm old so partying doesn't matter to me, but having tried and true, loyal friends do. Those that will stick by your side and have your back when $hit goes down. I've learned over my life anyone else, eh, f u and I don't worry about them. Blessings OP, I hope you figure out who your ride or dies are.", "I\u2019m waffling between NTA and NAH. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that if you feel like this group of friends is no longer good for you, then you need to look for a new group of friends. Whether they meant to hurt you or not, you feel excluded and marginalized; you don\u2019t trust them anymore. Do you really want to stay friends with them if this is how they behave?", "NAH - sounds like some miscommunication. But ending with \u201cnever speak to them again\u201d kind of does make me wonder if you\u2019re just a tad melodramatic\u2026", ">So I suggested that on Friday we would go to house parties so everyone could go together then on Saturday we would go to the bars It seemed like a win win.\n\nPrior to Halloween weekend, did the group actually confirm they would go along with this plan, or did you just assume they would because you suggested it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That can be very frustrating. That being said, I don\u2019t think they were trying to be rude. Going forward they need to communicate with you better.", "NTA for being hurt but I don't think never talking to them again is the answer. You need to have an open conversation with them explaining exactly how you feel because they may have been oblivious instead of openly antagonistic. You can use the result of an honest conversation to decide whether these are still people you want to be friends with or not.", "Nobody ever agreed with your plan, they just sucked at telling you they wanted to do something else. Maybe don't be so pushy next time and ASK what the others would like to do rather than telling them, and maybe they'll be better about including you on what the GROUP wants to do. ESH.", "You\u2019re completely right I am upset they didn\u2019t go how they were planned but it\u2019s more because I had friends coming from out of town and they were told one thing but it switched out of no where.", "They aren\u2019t terrible people. I\u2019ve had some really good times with them and they have been there for me in times I needed them and vice versa. I just think this instance they were influenced by other things and my feelings were put on the back burner. that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m being too dramatic by wanting to cut communication or not", "I can admit I am dramatic sometimes. I guess I just mean would it be wrong of me to cut communication after this. I really and hurt by how this went but I might just be too emotional to make a decision right now", "Yes, the moment we first talked about. It was the beginning of October and we all bought tickets for the event. The party was planned a week after we already bought the tickets.", "No they did agree and buy tickets for the event. The party was planned after tickets were bought.", "I missed the part about having friends come out of town. If that was the case, then you really should've made concrete plans with you and your out-of-town friends instead of trying to coordinate everything with your other friends. Of course with that many people, things aren't going to go smoothly and plans will change at the last minute. I would apologize to your friends for ignoring them, tell them how you feel without blaming them, and see if you all can make new plans in the future.", "Cool if they are good friends. It would be best if you talked to them then. Communication is KEY to any good relationship. Have a heart-to-heart and I bet you'll find out right away.  I'd talk to each one personally and say look, I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life, but what you did with so and so, really hurt me and I'm doubting what / where / kind of relationship we have. I want to be clear so I'm not putting more into this friendship than you feel it is. Let them define how 'dear' of friends you are. Not dramatic for wanting to cut communication, but before you just cut, I'd speak your peace and see what they say. Sure, it's uncomfortable, but as I said before, figure out who you ride and die are. If you can't talk to them, I think you answered your own question. You don't need to go after them, but with a humble heart ask, if they can't answer or get angry, there you go.", "You can chose not to be friends with anyone if you want. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you just tell them you\u2019re upset and why and take it from there.", "Then soft ESH.  \n\nYour friends should have clearly communicated to you that they wanted to switch plans.  To me, it kind of sounds like a \"too many things planned for one evening\" situation where the bars activity just got crossed off the list during the course of the night.\n\nFor you, I think it's clear not everyone agreed that having a whole night of activities that necessarily excluded one member of your group was a \"win-win.\" Look how upset you are at being excluded from a few events, even though it was probably not intentional. Your friend likely felt the same way--the only difference is that she responded with a real party and you responded with a pity-party.", "Yeah, I did have a point in the post where I talked about my friends coming out of town but I had to condense it so everything would fit. I kept going over the character limit. \n\nI think you\u2019re right, though I\u2019m getting my thoughts together to have a conversation with them. I responded to their last message letting them know that I was upset and I needed a minute to figure out my thoughts.", "I appreciate your insight. I think a key point of information that I deleted from the post because I did exceed the character limit is that everyone bought tickets for the event. Leading up to the event they were talking about how excited they were that my friends out of town we\u2019re coming and have fun in the event was going to be. No one brought up the party. No one told me about it or sent me the flyer. I gave them numerous times to tell me about the party or change the plans prior to the event, but they waited the literal night before to do it."]}
