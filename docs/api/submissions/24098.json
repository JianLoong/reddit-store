Yeah, I think you should have had a conversation with her about not saying that you would be totally helpless grocery shopping and such, but the bit about it \"taking more intellect\" to do what you do does come off as dismissive of what she juggles in a day, whether you meant it to or not.\n\nIt sounds like, from her history, she may have a lot of insecurity about giving up her intended career path to be a SAHM. She likely feels the need to \"show her work\" and to prove she's still an intellectual equal in the relationship.

Might be time to re-delegate some household chores to give her some free time to pursue her own ambitions.\n\nI do get where you are coming from and I've also been in a relationship like this where my ex would make little comments like that, but I usually just let them slide.

You say you contribute to chores but loading a dishwasher (incorrectly) is barely even a chore. \n\nYour wife is frustrated because this is not the life she wanted for herself, and it's not a super easy one. She wanted some validation which did take the form of putting you down (the E S H part). Your response was to tell her her job is easy, and of course you could do it because you have more intelligence than her and have a harder job than her. But you don't know that you could do this job just as good as her, because you've never had to do it. So why not just say \"you have had years of practice and I'm grateful for the sacrifice you made for our family\". Instead, your wife is bawling her eyes out because she had to give up her dream career for lack of money and marrying a guy who just wanted her to be a SAHM and then puts her down.\n\nSo yeah YTA. She's not without fault here, but I feel for her and she probably said that out of a decade of disappointment and just wanting to feel valued.", "YTA\nI also have a degree in finance.

It was still a learning curve for me because just knowing how to handle money and make complex decisions in a controlled environment is not even kind of the same thing. \n\nSounds like she might have been passive-aggressive with her comment - but why do you think she feels compelled to address it like that? Based on the tone of your post, I'm guessing you are condescending, and you may say the words \"I appreciate what she does,\" but you don't take any actions to back that up. \n\nShe sacrificed a rewarding career to take on a very, very unrewarding - though extremely important - role at home.  You owe your ability to excel at your job to her because I'm guessing you never have to call out or leave work early for a sick child or doctors appointments. Plus you can remain focused while working and not have to also be thinking about what you're going to make for dinner,  if you took the meat out of the freezer, when is soccer practice,  what will you be getting your child for her birthday/christmas, etc.  \n\nApologize to your wife and thank her for all of the visible and invisible work she does - preferably with specifics", "YTA.

If that's a non-starter because you want her totally focused on taking care of you and the house, yta.", "This seems like she was seeking validation for her efforts. She totally could have approached the subject in a better way though.", "ESH. Have an open and honest discussion about where these comments are coming from and how they affect you.", "After reading OPs comments, YTA OP. Your wife gave up everything in order to raise your child. This includes making your masters degree and your career possible, you literally would have neither of those things if she hadn\u2019t sacrificed everything she wanted for herself to make your life possible. She could\u2019ve left you with a kid, returned to her home country and let all of your dreams fall apart instead of her own. \n\nSeveral people have suggested that you take up her job since you believe you can do it, and allow her to return to her education. You have declined. This means you literally *can\u2019t* do her job. You lied. Why would you decline to do this? I\u2019ll tell you, because it has a massive personal cost and sacrifice to give up what you want so someone else can have what they want. That\u2019s what she did for you, you aren\u2019t capable of that, or you would. Forget the groceries. You literally are refusing to do her job because the cost is too high for you to pay (in your mind). It wasn\u2019t too high for her to pay, and for her to keep paying, so you actually cannot do her job. \n\nI suggest that you do something to allow her to be more fulfilled. At a minimum, cut back on your work hours so she can return to her education part time, take up a lot more at home so she can pursue another interest, whatever. Either way, it\u2019s the bare minimum you owe her. She\u2019s obviously unfulfilled and since she made your dreams happen, it\u2019s your turn to return the favor. Stop saying you can do her job when you can\u2019t and are flat out unwilling to, and start looking for ways to give her a sense of pride and accomplishment. She deserves a happy and fulfilled life too.\n\nEdit: For those who are confused, here are OPs relevant comments:\n\nOn the question, \u201cdoes she want to finish her education?\u201d\n\n> She has said that she wants to go back, and talked about the great things she could have done but I never asked her because she always follows up with it might be too late. I did tell her that to an extent it is true that it is hard to start your career late.\n\n> She would not be able to afford it without me, and she would have less time for our daughter if she did that, so I am not super keen on encouraging that and she has not mentioned it to me directly.\n\n> She does not even have a bachelors only an unfinished one. If she went back I feel like she would want to do the same thing or just computer science. She is not into arts or business things. She still does programming as a hobby.\n\n> Initially, the plan was actually for her to start working once she was legally allowed to do so after marriage and then get another loan and go and complete her degree, but once I got a good job we could manage on one income and I asked her about being a SAHM and having a child and she agreed.\n\nOn paying for his wife\u2019s education (please note that his wife made his education possible):\n\n> I was thinking of bringing up getting a second child, I dont think we could afford that if she were in school and I was paying for it, especially an Ivy.\n\n> She was an academic snob back then so she would definitely want to go to an Ivy and she knows our finances so it would be theoretically possible but put a dent in it.\n\n> She would very likely want to finish her Ivy degree, she has 3 semesters left to graduate.\n\n> I was thinking of talking to her about a second kid, she was previously at an Ivy and tuition is expensive (and even more so than when we went) so I dont think she could afford that by working herself. I could only afford it as my parents helped me.\n\nAnd your wife OP. Once again. \n\nOn the fact that a second child would likely set back her goals:\n\n> By then I really doubt she would have any interest in going back for a career and would be too old to get hired for junior roles.\n\n> Now she is not, I meant if we had a second kid and then she went back once the second kid were older.", "I'll be direct. Yes, you're an AH. \n\nThe problem with men that have money is that we tend to commercialize and tie everything to money. \n\nYou ignore the companionship, the sacrifices, and the love your wife and mother of your kids provide you even after getting bogged out with housework. \n\nYou feel for example, yes I can cook or I can hire a chef, but forget there's a difference between someone who cooks because they love you, and the one who does you pay them to. \n\nHowever, the reason you're an AH is because you fail to recognize how much work goes into the housework she does because you do it once in a while. Take a hint from the fact that when you do it, she complains, but when she does, you don't. Most likely, it means you're not doing it properly. \n\nHousework is hard work, and you should recognize that.

A mother was stranded out of the country for months because of COVID, the husband managed fine but when she came back she told all her friends and family he couldn't cope/borderline incompetent without her and the place was a mess for so long. Obviously she was hurt she didn't seem needed.\n\nAsk her if she wants to go back to college or get help during the day so she can focus on other passions.

When she said \"what would you ever do without me?\" I'm betting she wanted validation of your love for her, your place in each other's lives, and your appreciation for what she does. She knows you could figure it out - I wouldn't respect my husband if I didn't think he could do what I do as a SAHM, and certainly wouldn't have had a kid with him bc shit happens and I have to know my child would be competently cared for if something happened to me.\n\nYou and your wife have made some difficult choices to have the life you have. She gave up her studies in order to build this family with you, which is beautiful, but maybe this pattern of  putting you down about household skills is more about feeling like she isn't fulfilling her intellectual potential and trying to be the \"best\" in the arena she's (perhaps) reluctantly in? I relate and occasionally grieve the professional success I might have achieved.\n\nI'd try to have a calm and honest conversation with your wife about how her comments make you feel, and why that hurt made you react so defensively. I think you felt belittled and put her down in reaction to that feeling, by saying of course you could do what she does (which, btw, you probably would be able to learn with time but couldn't do tomorrow. She's honing skills like you are at your job.) I think you can see how, if you're already feeling like you aren't living up to your potential/you're smart enough to do more than you're doing, your partner who gets to live out those dreams of professional success basically saying you're doing something he could do easily might touch a nerve.\n\nThis can be talked out if you both come from a place of compassion, and if you're serious about supporting your wife as she figures out what she needs to do about her feelings about being a SAHM.

And yes if you don't do it properly (which you can learn), the dishes won't get properly cleaned and she will have to do it again. She is not only a housewife (which you seem to treat like a servant), but she also looks after your daughter, 24/7, no sick days or pay, no holiday, no break, clearly no thank you or recognition. Do you realise that you never have to worry about taking time off work to look after a sick child or because the child is on holiday, so you can just concentrate on your career? That you basically come home and that is it for your day? Trust me, it is not just one thing, it is a lot of little tasks which add up and deadlines (food shopping/cooking), preparation for say shopping or going anywhere, make sure that kids is where she needs to be, that all homework are completed, clean all day and having to do it all again every single day, laundry, ironing, being a good mum, good friend, good daughter/sister, good wife, taxi driver, and being careful about money...

If you are late to a school drop off, you just get to be late. If you don't feel like cooking you can order dinner or wing it and make some spaghetti or another 5 second meal that any kids will be happy with.

It was rare to take more than 3 classes per quarter because every class was double the class time and tests. 9 hours of class time per week worth 3 units. It was hard to fit more into your schedule.

Came home from his HVAC job during the summer, so obviously his busy season, and said he was exhausted and just ate dinner quickly and went to lay down. Absolutely nothing unusual about it. The man worked 14-16 hour days during the summer sometimes, in the heat. She fell asleep on the couch watching TV, got up around 2am and went to bed, and he was already cold. They had three kids together, the youngest was 13, so yeah, not LITTLE kids, but still. Kids. She'd had jobs off and on, but had NEVER been the main bread winner and was mostly a SAHM. I will say, I am incredibly proud of how well she stepped the fuck up. The kids did get his SS monthly which helped tremendously, but she has her Medical Assistant certification and went back to work. She obviously didn't want to live in the house he died in, they rented so it wasn't THAT hard to just pick up and move, which they did, and she's been a great single mom to those kids. Granted, she's remarried now, he's been gone 8 years, so definitely fine that she was able to move on, and it was like, 2-3 years after he passed that she met the guy, so in no way disrespectful or anything. But based on her history, we absolutely expected the worst. They didn't have the greatest marriage, I could go on forever giving examples as to why we didn't expect much, but she immediately stepped the fuck up and is still super close with our family and those kids are thriving. Oldest will graduate from a prestigious private university in our state with his Nurse Practitioner degree, going in to sports medicine. Kid was always an exceptional athlete and got a full ride football scholarship.
