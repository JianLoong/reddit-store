Yeah, I think you should have had a conversation with her about not saying that you would be totally helpless grocery shopping and such, but the bit about it \"taking more intellect\" to do what you do does come off as dismissive of what she juggles in a day, whether you meant it to or not.\n\nIt sounds like, from her history, she may have a lot of insecurity about giving up her intended career path to be a SAHM. She likely feels the need to \"show her work\" and to prove she's still an intellectual equal in the relationship.

And now for better or worse she is a SAHM with no degree or paying job.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that you are proud of your intellectual capabilities and the complex tasks you tackle at work. It is part of your identity and your ego. Your wife has none of that, even though that\u2019s what she wanted.

Might be time to re-delegate some household chores to give her some free time to pursue her own ambitions.\n\nI do get where you are coming from and I've also been in a relationship like this where my ex would make little comments like that, but I usually just let them slide. It just adds up over time and you probably would have been better off addressing it long ago, along the lines of \"Hey, you know I appreciate what you do here, but when you make comments like that it makes me believe that you think I'm incapable of caring for myself.\"\n\nEither way, just sit down and ask her if she wants to make some changes around the house.

She wants validation from you that what she does is important. I'm not a mom let alone a SAHM but I can only imagine the grind of being a homemaker and mother day in and day out. And then to make a light hearted comment just for confirmation that you APPRECIATE her just to get lectured. Oy. My husband and I all the time tell each other \"what would you do without me?\" over the most mundane accomplishments but for us it's a form of giving each other appreciation.", "There\u2019s a very easy solution to this dilemma. Send your wife on a nice vacation for a week (preferably two) and you stay home and do the things.\n\nI feel like your wife was teasing you and you kinda took and twisted it.

Maybe get her a little gift and a nice card expressing your appreciation and apologize for belittling her role in your home.", "YTA \nAs a former stay at home mom, the underlying vibe you get from people is that you\u2019re useless. She was looking for you to say how she is going above and beyond and that you appreciate it", "YTA\n\nI've done it and it is surprisingly hard work. Never enough hours in the day.

You say you contribute to chores but loading a dishwasher (incorrectly) is barely even a chore. \n\nYour wife is frustrated because this is not the life she wanted for herself, and it's not a super easy one. She wanted some validation which did take the form of putting you down (the E S H part). Your response was to tell her her job is easy, and of course you could do it because you have more intelligence than her and have a harder job than her. But you don't know that you could do this job just as good as her, because you've never had to do it. So why not just say \"you have had years of practice and I'm grateful for the sacrifice you made for our family\". Instead, your wife is bawling her eyes out because she had to give up her dream career for lack of money and marrying a guy who just wanted her to be a SAHM and then puts her down.\n\nSo yeah YTA. She's not without fault here, but I feel for her and she probably said that out of a decade of disappointment and just wanting to feel valued.", "YTA\nI also have a degree in finance.  I also was a SAHM. It was still a learning curve for me because just knowing how to handle money and make complex decisions in a controlled environment is not even kind of the same thing. \n\nSounds like she might have been passive-aggressive with her comment - but why do you think she feels compelled to address it like that? Based on the tone of your post, I'm guessing you are condescending, and you may say the words \"I appreciate what she does,\" but you don't take any actions to back that up. \n\nShe sacrificed a rewarding career to take on a very, very unrewarding - though extremely important - role at home.  You owe your ability to excel at your job to her because I'm guessing you never have to call out or leave work early for a sick child or doctors appointments. Plus you can remain focused while working and not have to also be thinking about what you're going to make for dinner,  if you took the meat out of the freezer, when is soccer practice,  what will you be getting your child for her birthday/christmas, etc.  \n\nApologize to your wife and thank her for all of the visible and invisible work she does - preferably with specifics", "YTA.

Your kid is 7, it seems like she is feeling a bit stifled, it could be really meaningful for her and make her feel more equal and seen in your marriage. If that's a non-starter because you want her totally focused on taking care of you and the house, yta.", "This seems like she was seeking validation for her efforts. She totally could have approached the subject in a better way though.", "ESH. Have an open and honest discussion about where these comments are coming from and how they affect you.", "After reading OPs comments, YTA OP. Your wife gave up everything in order to raise your child. This includes making your masters degree and your career possible, you literally would have neither of those things if she hadn\u2019t sacrificed everything she wanted for herself to make your life possible. She could\u2019ve left you with a kid, returned to her home country and let all of your dreams fall apart instead of her own. \n\nSeveral people have suggested that you take up her job since you believe you can do it, and allow her to return to her education. You have declined. This means you literally *can\u2019t* do her job. You lied. Why would you decline to do this? I\u2019ll tell you, because it has a massive personal cost and sacrifice to give up what you want so someone else can have what they want. That\u2019s what she did for you, you aren\u2019t capable of that, or you would. Forget the groceries. You literally are refusing to do her job because the cost is too high for you to pay (in your mind). It wasn\u2019t too high for her to pay, and for her to keep paying, so you actually cannot do her job. \n\nI suggest that you do something to allow her to be more fulfilled. At a minimum, cut back on your work hours so she can return to her education part time, take up a lot more at home so she can pursue another interest, whatever. Either way, it\u2019s the bare minimum you owe her. She\u2019s obviously unfulfilled and since she made your dreams happen, it\u2019s your turn to return the favor. Stop saying you can do her job when you can\u2019t and are flat out unwilling to, and start looking for ways to give her a sense of pride and accomplishment. She deserves a happy and fulfilled life too.", "I'll be direct. Yes, you're an AH. \n\nThe problem with men that have money is that we tend to commercialize and tie everything to money. \n\nYou ignore the companionship, the sacrifices, and the love your wife and mother of your kids provide you even after getting bogged out with housework. \n\nYou feel for example, yes I can cook or I can hire a chef, but forget there's a difference between someone who cooks because they love you, and the one who does you pay them to. \n\nHowever, the reason you're an AH is because you fail to recognize how much work goes into the housework she does because you do it once in a while. Take a hint from the fact that when you do it, she complains, but when she does, you don't. Most likely, it means you're not doing it properly. \n\nHousework is hard work, and you should recognize that. But often time, until men have to do it frequently, we don't understand how hard it can be.", "NAH\n\nFor the love of god, can people just communicate instead of being passive aggressive? \n\nSit with her, apologize, but also tell her that what she says has a negative effect on you.

A mother was stranded out of the country for months because of COVID, the husband managed fine but when she came back she told all her friends and family he couldn't cope/borderline incompetent without her and the place was a mess for so long. Obviously she was hurt she didn't seem needed.\n\nAsk her if she wants to go back to college or get help during the day so she can focus on other passions.

When she said \"what would you ever do without me?\" I'm betting she wanted validation of your love for her, your place in each other's lives, and your appreciation for what she does. She knows you could figure it out - I wouldn't respect my husband if I didn't think he could do what I do as a SAHM, and certainly wouldn't have had a kid with him bc shit happens and I have to know my child would be competently cared for if something happened to me.\n\nYou and your wife have made some difficult choices to have the life you have. She gave up her studies in order to build this family with you, which is beautiful, but maybe this pattern of  putting you down about household skills is more about feeling like she isn't fulfilling her intellectual potential and trying to be the \"best\" in the arena she's (perhaps) reluctantly in? I relate and occasionally grieve the professional success I might have achieved.\n\nI'd try to have a calm and honest conversation with your wife about how her comments make you feel, and why that hurt made you react so defensively. I think you felt belittled and put her down in reaction to that feeling, by saying of course you could do what she does (which, btw, you probably would be able to learn with time but couldn't do tomorrow. She's honing skills like you are at your job.) I think you can see how, if you're already feeling like you aren't living up to your potential/you're smart enough to do more than you're doing, your partner who gets to live out those dreams of professional success basically saying you're doing something he could do easily might touch a nerve.\n\nThis can be talked out if you both come from a place of compassion, and if you're serious about supporting your wife as she figures out what she needs to do about her feelings about being a SAHM.

She laughed at me saying I couldn\u2019t handle it and she went on and on about how hard it is. Sure, it was an adjustment, but within the first week I had it down. The house was cleaner than ever, I cooked better meals than she was cooking, grocery spending came down because I planned, I lost weight because I ate less and had time to exercise. She was not happy about how well I was doing at all. I told her it\u2019s because I\u2019d plan things out, schedule times to clean certain rooms and stuck to a schedule as if it were an office job. She hated that I lost weight and that everything was running great, she said I was trying to make her look bad. I left it at that. I didn\u2019t tell her that I only cleaned about 1-2 hours per day, and cooked maybe 1-2 hour per day, and had plenty of time to exercise and take the kids out for fun. It was super easy, I just don\u2019t think she had management skills.\n\nShe comes home from work exhausted with zero energy, she ended up going part time and asking me to hire someone to clean. I did it for a while, but then stopped it. The cleaning lady would come over for 6 hours per week and clean everything. My wife worked 25 hours from home. I told her she could find 6 hours to clean the house during the week, and paying someone $200 per week is ridiculous. I find time to take care of the yard and pool and wash the cars weekly, and I work 50 hours per week minimum. It\u2019s laziness that my wife has, but I won\u2019t tell her that.

If she programmes as a hobby already and is smart enough to study physics , it won\u2019t take long for her to skill up and  learn some languages and pick up a tech/ quant / data role - she doesn\u2019t even have to go to college to do this . \n\nIt sounds more like you\u2019re making the plans here and she\u2019s having to go along so she can stay in the  country .  It all feels a little transactional - which is fine , you both agreed to the setup .\n\nSometimes people won\u2019t say the truth if they know how the person asking already feels.  Judging by the way you speak about her - I have an inkling that may be the case . Maybe she\u2019s going along with your plans to keep peace ? Have you asked her what she REALLY \n wants to do?", "Wait but your kid is 7.  If you wanted a second you should have already had the kid.  \n\nIt's time for her goals to be center.  Yours have for the last 7 years.", "The language he uses around his wife is sketchy at best\u2026 .", "Where does it say he refused her to continue schooling compared to he suggested she be a SAHM and she agreed to it. \n\nAlso that's fine but the point I'm making is why is ok to insult your partner to lift yourself up. Hate saying this but if roles were reversed and OP was bragging about how well he did the laundry and that his wife can never get the shirts as soft as him because she couldn't figure out the right method. Would you suggest the wife bow down and agree how amazing he is because \"he just wants to be appreciated\" or would you say he went about it the wrong way.", "She\u2019s well aware that she\u2019s dependent on his income to survive.", "She was an academic snob back then so she would definitely want to go to an Ivy and she knows our finances so it would be theoretically possible but put a dent in it.\n\nHer dream was working in research or glamorous jobs like google and for that Ivy helps.", "While it was my idea, she never objected to it in any way. I feel that kids bring stability to a family and relationship so that is why I wanted one.\n\nI could ask her about it, but my gut feeling is that she would say yes and expect me to financially cover it and because we are older by the time she finishes, if we wait for a second child the second would have a huge age gap with the first.", "She does not even have a bachelors only an unfinished one. If she went back I feel like she would want to do the same thing or just computer science. She is not into arts or business things. \n\nShe still does programming as a hobby.", "Right.\n\nAnd vice versa. As the first thing he pointed out is that she does a great job of taking care of their home.", "But again, you don't know for sure. Communication is a wonderful thing in that it clears things up. Really, you should try it because wow, you look like a controlling, manipulative asshole at this point.", "Lmao kids bring WHAT??", "The biggest problem right now isn't even the housework issue, it's that you haven't talked to her about anything and you have come to reddit without even truly knowing what she wants.  \n\nAnd what do you mean she'll \"expect me to cover it\", why shouldn't she? If your parents supported you throughout your education simply because you were family, why wouldn't you happily support her because she's your family now? And yes, maybe by the time she's in a position to have a baby again it might not the be the best timing, but that's okay. You won't have a second child, but she'll have a career that makes her happy. Your job brings you so much pride and self-worth, why wouldn't you want the same for her?\n\nSo have a honest conversation with her. Not one where you project your ideas and influence her opinion, but one where you just listen to what she wants and needs.", "A second kid will also bring in more work for your wife\u2026 She clearly needs a change and a new baby is NOT what she needs. Homie fucking talk to her about school and if she still wants to go back. THAT is waaaaaaaay more important than having another kid", "\u201cJust computer science \u201c - again condescending language towards her . You don\u2019t think computer science a worthy degree?  \nIt sounds like she has already told you what she wants but YOU don\u2019t thing it\u2019s important enough . FYI computer science and programming are hot on job the market right now !", "He said that to us. He told her he could do what she does. He\u2019s not dependent on her contributions in the same way, or at least that\u2019s what he told her.", "She has said that she wants to go back, and talked about the great things she could have done but I never asked her because she always follows up with it might be too late. I did tell her that to an extent it is true that it is hard to start your career late."]}
