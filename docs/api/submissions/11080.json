You gotta put your own life jacket on first before you can help anyone else out.", "NTA.

In their situation though, I would have offered to help as I could while keeping my regular job to be security for my bills. \n\nIf you choose to do so, why not offer them a job like you would offer anyone with their skillset and experience. If they work really hard, they can progress through the ranks just like anyone else in your company. If they decline starting at a reasonable position at a reasonable payrate, that's an indication that they are more interested in the rewards than helping do the work. I would recommend having trusted employees be cutouts between you and them, and make sure they know that they have your expectation to treat all employees equally.\n\nIf you choose not to hire friends and family that is ok too. You asked them when you had positions available. You might not have jobs that would suit them anymore. Their lack of support when you had to close down would have soured me on being too generous. You can be their friend without being their ATM.\n\nNTA", "This reminds me of the story of the little red hen that tries to get the other animals to help contribute to a meal, they decline to help at all, but then they expect to be fed from the hen\u2019s hard work. \n\nNTA.
