You're not responsible for managing any of this. \n\nI suppose now that the secret is out, at least his dad won't have to hide in secret anymore.

The fact your ex's reaction was so abhorrent tells you why his dad kept it a secret. Sexuality is not something that anyone should ever reveal, no matter what the situation. The sad fact is that being gay can still get people physically hurt so only the individual can decide who they feel safe to tell.", "NTA.

Coming out to yourself is like, the hardest thing to do and then the realization that it\u2019s such a process and you\u2019re not coming out once, you do it over and over is terrifying.

He's straight up lying to her and so is cheating and again while there is no obligation to tell people about cheating, it's not outrageous to inform someone being cheated on that their partner is lying to them.\n\nFor all the people who say outing people is scummy, it is IF that person is doing nothing to hurt anyone else and it's their own business. A person who is cheating on a partner by having an affair and pretending to be straight is hurting other people by lying and it's not the same. Being lgbtq is not an excuse to cheat on and hurt people with a blanket rule that no one can out you because it's somehow unfair to do so.

But I'll also say that I understand why your ex is upset. This could feel like a betrayal, even if it's probably not totally directed at you.", "They shouldn't be bothering you.", "Okay so father is out partying a straight bar without his wife and tells OP not to tell anyone because his wife doesn't know. I would probably tell father to come clean or I would do it for him, at least for the health of his wife.", "Maybe you need to be that friend to the dad now until he's more comfortable and things with the family has cooled off a little.", "Hes a cheating asshole why are you acting like lying to your spouse for years is no big deal? Kind and loving people don't do that shit", "Kind and loving? I mean you are NTA for not outing him but what he did was horrible. Not a good husband or a father. What is happening to us if we are excusing this kind of behaviour? He could have left his wife if he wasn\u2019t ready to come out, not have a full double life", "Why a betrayal? He's not in any way harmed or affected by his dad's sexual orientation.", "I understand what you mean, but i'd like to clarify his wife knew he was seeing other people, she was too. This arrangement was something my ex struggled with and had told me about, early on in the relationship. The wife just didn't know that he wasn't straight", "> Hes a cheating asshole why are you acting like lying to your spouse for years is no big deal? Kind and loving people don't do that shit\n\nThe pendulum has swung so far to the other side that a man who cheats on his wife with other men is now considered a kind and loving person / a victim of circumstances. \n\n\nThe (cheating) emperor has no clothes. But if you point it out, you're homophobic. Completely irrational.", "You sound really hostile. Who had hurt you? Please share your story.", "OP says the parents were in an open relationship, so there was no cheating.", "Unless the dad was lying about the wife knowing.\n\nEta: NTA. It's understandable for the family yo feel betrayed but it's not OPs place to out the dad. I struggle with the concept of deception but this is far more complex than that, and OP presumably knew the dad was a good person to his family.", "Yup open relationship but not ethical. Maybe she didn\u2019t ask?", "NTA, in almost every situation you will be justified in keeping someone\u2019s sexuality secret. If the wife already knew he was with other people and didn\u2019t care, why should the gender matter? You did the right thing, sorry your ex and their family are weird and homophobic.", "NTA- honestly that whole family sounds fucked. No wonder why he didn't want them to know in the first place.", "Wait, is that what OP meant by \"she knew he was with other people?\" I just thought that meant she knew he was going out that night.", "I mean, \"with other people\" is pretty clear, no? I don't think I've ever hear that expression mean anything other than being with other people, so much so I can't think of many good ways to phrase it differently. \n\nIf it was just going out, he'd have said \"oh yeah, wife knows I like to go to the clubs and party but not what kind of club I go to\" or something very different.", "Ok, I'm still a bit confused because the only mention of him being with other people was only in one sentence where the focus is that the relationship is open. So I'm not sure how you could have missed that but assumed he was cheating? \n\nAs long as you aren't assuming queer people in hetero relationships aren't running around cheating just due to their sexuality, we're all good haha", "Just read completely over where it said \u201cand that his wife was aware he was with other people but thought he was straight\u201d. My take was that the father was cheating. It just happened to be with men. It\u2019s the cheating I focused on, not the men."]}
