My friends and I frequent LGBTQ bars, especially because one of my close friends is gay, two are bi. \n\nWe were at the club one night and someone's hand hit mine, causing my drink to fall all over me. I turn to look and it's my ex's dad, apologising, until he looked at me. He was also cross dressing at that point, but still recognisable. He almost turned pale. I asked him to wait and meet me by the smoking zone.\nMy friends in that city, who I was with that night, didn't know my ex's family. So I was able to make an excuse and slip away. I told them I had met an old friend and that I'd be back in a couple minutes. \n\nI spoke to my ex's dad and reassured him that his secret was safe with me. I am not going to into to the details of his sexuality, but the dad goes by he/him. He explicitly mentioned that his family cannot know and that his wife was aware that he was with other people, but thought he was straight. \n\nThis was about 6 months into my relationship with my ex.\n\nIncident (Present)\n\nMy ex and his family recently found out about the dad. Apparently there was a heated argument during which my ex said \"you have no idea the shame you have caused. my friends, our relatives, what are they gonna think of you?\" to which the dad said \"everyone's gonna be fine.

I wouldn\u2019t take it personally, if anything it sounds like you made the father more comfortable in his own skin. \n\nThere is an argument that the father was the asshole for hiding a lot about himself but I can see how that happened. Likewise, you could say the family are assholes for the language and reaction but I\u2019m not sure anyone would have reacted differently if they found out their father had a secret, sexual double life. \n\nMaybe there are no assholes and it\u2019s just really difficult.", "NTA.

It wasn't your secret to share either.", "I don't know the details, but I assume he was in the bar not innocently, but in order to have sexual relations with people other than his wife? If that's the case, how would you feel if a friend of yours saw your boyfriend cheating on you and said nothing? In my opinion it's a decent thing to do to inform the spouse, for the health's sake if for not any other reason - even though strictly speaking it isn't your information to pass. I would have talked to the ex' father about tge situation and gave him some time to admit to cheating on his wife (not necessarily to anything else, that's where I draw the line though i still believe she has a right to know who she mattied), otherwise you will tell it to them (again, without mentioning the orientation part).

Is it OK to step outside your marriage with someone of the same sex, but not with someone of the opposite sex? Or does it make no difference?", "I really have no idea what you're on about...\n\nI will say it again: Being queer doesn't inherently mean you are stepping out!!!\n\nBut also, in this specific case, the couple had some version of an open relationship where it was ok according to the rules of the relationship, so he wasn't stepping out either.", "Ah, I missed the open marriage bit.
