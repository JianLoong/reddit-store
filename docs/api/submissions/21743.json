You're not responsible for managing any of this. \n\nI suppose now that the secret is out, at least his dad won't have to hide in secret anymore.

The fact your ex's reaction was so abhorrent tells you why his dad kept it a secret. Sexuality is not something that anyone should ever reveal, no matter what the situation. The sad fact is that being gay can still get people physically hurt so only the individual can decide who they feel safe to tell.", "NTA.

He's straight up lying to her and so is cheating and again while there is no obligation to tell people about cheating, it's not outrageous to inform someone being cheated on that their partner is lying to them.\n\nFor all the people who say outing people is scummy, it is IF that person is doing nothing to hurt anyone else and it's their own business. A person who is cheating on a partner by having an affair and pretending to be straight is hurting other people by lying and it's not the same. Being lgbtq is not an excuse to cheat on and hurt people with a blanket rule that no one can out you because it's somehow unfair to do so.

As in, they both willingly consent to their partner seeking and participating in heterosexual relationships or trysts.   What that *doesn't mean* is that it will also be ok for one of the interested parties to step outside the terms of said agreement, i.e. one party of the relationship is willfully & knowingly stepping outside the defined parameters by changing out the implied gender and/or sexuality of any past/current partners while simultaneously withholding said developments from the original partner of said agreement.  That's dishonesty by omission. Ergo, it's *cheating* since there isn't even implied consent from their main partner to engage in sexual acts with a gender/sexual identity that wasn't part of the original collaborative pact mutually agreed upon by both parties.  \nPoint is, engaging in sexual congress that exists outside of marital vows and any outstanding mutual agreements made by both the interested parties is equal to cheating. \nThe term infidelity is literally defined as: whenever a person in a monogamous relationship or marriage willingly engages in either an emotional or sexual relationship *without said partner's knowledge or consent*.   So let's not try to split hairs regarding terms, part of maintaining an open relationship is supposedly based on honesty and willful consent. Sex acts committed upon or with any person or entity that can be defined or described as outside of the established terms of said agreement is equal to infidelity.

Your ex hs mad bc well his dad lied to him. However his father was the one to lie you never lied bc he never asked you!!", "NTA. Ex's dad's family is just mad right now. But later on, they will realize it wasn't your fault. You're just minding your own business. Just block them to get some peace of mind.", "Absolutely NTA in fact I admire your maturity in handling the matter. I would hope that I would be able to proceed just as you had\u2026wonderful.  As far As the family\u2019s reaction don\u2019t give it a second thought\u2026.to twist your handling into being called a liar that is ridiculous.", "It is not your job to out anybody. As a Queer man, I wouldn't want to he outted either. You did the right thing by not saying anything. It's very easy to put someone in danger by telling other people about their Queer identity before they are ready. \nThe people who are bothering you and bombarding you do not understand what it's like to be terrified like that and have to walk through life being afraid of people finding out. \nYou.

As long as ex's dad was being safe - doesn't matter the gender - then what you knew wasn't anything that they needed to know. I doubt that either the mum or dad were actively telling the family who they were sleeping with, so why is this any different? \n\nOuting someone is an awful thing to do. The fact that your ex would have been okay with that means that you're lucky to not be with him anymore. It sounds as though your ex and the family have some homophobic views if they are happy to out people and also don't want anyone knowing about the dads crossdressing and sexuality. \n\nThey suck. You were just being a decent person.", "NTA.\n\nYou kept your word to the dad.", "NTA - My first reaction was no! - you don't spill something like that.  The consequences could be too severe.\n\nThen I was reading the people arguing that you should tell someone if their spouse is cheating on them.  They have a point, and I suppose if AIDS were still as serious a problem as it was, you might have a moral obligation to tell his wife.\n\nYou did what you thought was right, and I wouldn't criticize you for it.  It's just too bad that your ungrateful ex-FIL doesn't have your sense of discretion.", "Hearing straight people make judgements about when and how we LGBTQ people should come out is super cringy.", "he was cheating on his wife", "yeah nta, if anything the dad is an ass for bringing you into this", "You did all the right things. \n\nYou kept a confidence. You didn't out someone who wasn't ready. And your calm reaction gave a person the knowledge that not everyone in his sphere is as judgmental and nasty as his immediate family. Good for you!", "From what I understand about open relationships you clarify each partner expects and if anybody steps outside of those rules then it\u2019s considered cheating.", "NTA and OP, it wasn't your secret to tell. Your ex is an AH and who cares about hai family? Just block them all and move on with your life.

It wasn\u2019t your secret to tell.", "NTA - it wasn't your secret, so you got no right to tell it. For me, it's that easy!", "NTA. The homophobes are just looking for anybody to blame. If they were less shitty he wouldn't have kept it a secret.", "yeah but I can see how he wanted to just tell his son ans family that no, they're wrong people will accept him. it seems like it was a heat of the moment thing and a reaction to his family saying no one will love and accept who he is, so he retaliated that someone who was in their family once already accepted him\n\nit caused a lot of unnecessary stress involving people no longer in OP's life but I feel it was just an example he gave to show not everyone will hold the same views as them and ostracize him. he shouldn't have done it but I can sympathize. he never did anything wrong and was never unfaithful, his family is mad he just didn't only have sexual relations with women. \n\nusually family get angry at a family member in these situations because they lied and broke their SO's trust by not being faithful, but in this situation they're just angry he's not straight", "Your mother might have been afraid of losing whatever custody she had of you and did not want to be cut off from you.

As this man is a father of adults, he was almost certainly married before society stopped being violently homophobic. \n\nAnd furthermore nothing in OP\u2019s story constitutes any kind of proof that this man is actually sleeping with men. He went to a gay club in drag. \u201cStraight\u201d also implies being cisgender, not only heterosexual, and OP didn\u2019t specify what applies here. Lotta people making a lotta assumptions.\n\nAnd bisexual people don\u2019t owe you their detailed life story, either.", "Your ex and his family are disgusting people, be glad you\u2019re away from bigoted pile of horse sh\u00eet. You did the right thing, respecting your exes dad. It\u2019s not your place or business to out someone, anyway. I feel for exes dad, having to go through what he is right now.

Doesn't that mean it's not cheating?!", "NTA. You were asked to keep a confidence. \n\nThey\u2019re just pissed and want someone to blame. Block them all. He\u2019s your ex.

It wasn\u2019t your story to tell.", "NTA but he definitely shouldn't have told them you knew.", "NTA, it was not your secret to tell but it was your ex dad\u2019s. You did nothing wrong.

I am an you are faithful or you are out kind of person. \n\nI thought if consent was given to have sex with other people and no condition attached that wife needs to approve the partners it's not cheating IMO. \n\nThat being said he did betrayed the wife and is a huge liar for not being honu from the beginning but as I said don't really know how open relationships work.", "Pretty much just discussion with your partner with what you are and aren't comfortable with. Some relationships don't care at all and others have very specific rules. Judging by the wife's reaction I'm guessing there wasn't a discussion"]}
