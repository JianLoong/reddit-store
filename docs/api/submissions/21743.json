We're in our early 20s. His dad is in his 50s (M). Our break up was decent. He was understanding and didn't harbour any negative emotions towards me (or at least i think he didn't). The two cities mentioned here are close by, and I travel between the two quite often - i grew up in one city and work in the other.\n\nIncident (Past)\n\nWhen we were dating, I had travelled to the other city at one point. My friends and I frequent LGBTQ bars, especially because one of my close friends is gay, two are bi. \n\nWe were at the club one night and someone's hand hit mine, causing my drink to fall all over me. I turn to look and it's my ex's dad, apologising, until he looked at me. He was also cross dressing at that point, but still recognisable. He almost turned pale. I asked him to wait and meet me by the smoking zone.\nMy friends in that city, who I was with that night, didn't know my ex's family. So I was able to make an excuse and slip away. I told them I had met an old friend and that I'd be back in a couple minutes. \n\nI spoke to my ex's dad and reassured him that his secret was safe with me. I am not going to into to the details of his sexuality, but the dad goes by he/him. He explicitly mentioned that his family cannot know and that his wife was aware that he was with other people, but thought he was straight. \n\nThis was about 6 months into my relationship with my ex.\n\nIncident (Present)\n\nMy ex and his family recently found out about the dad. Apparently there was a heated argument during which my ex said \"you have no idea the shame you have caused. my friends, our relatives, what are they gonna think of you?\" to which the dad said \"everyone's gonna be fine. In fact (my name) has known about me for years now\"\n\n- this is what my ex said to me when he called me yelling.\n\nhis family has been texting and calling me non stop saying that i was the dad's partner in crime, that i should've told them, that i lied to them. my ex says he's glad we're not together cause apparently i'm good at lying and hiding secrets, followed with a lot of terrible name calling \n\nI did speak to my ex when I asked him how he found out about me knowing.
