The process was very traumatizing so I won\u2019t go into detail about it, but I was heartbroken and don\u2019t really feel the same as I did before in a lot of aspects. Seeing as how I\u2019m so young, I knew from the beginning I never wanted my parents to know, and my boyfriend at the time agreed. This has never been an issue. My therapist, however, told me I needed a support system, so I\u2019ve told a few close friends who have all been really great, they\u2019ve let me talk, cry, plan a small memorial and build a memorial box. The journey has been hard but I\u2019m healing, now on to the conflict.\nI made a new friend who seemed very cool, but things came to a head when I explained that I had a difficult time talking about babies, hearing jokes about abortion, etc. during a conversation.They didn\u2019t understand, and immediately assumed I was pro-life (no hate to anyone who is, I\u2019m simply not) and started calling me all kinds of awful things but I shut that down and explained the real reason. Like most people, she had a flood of questions that I answered until she asked \u2018how did your parents react?\u2019. I\u2019d never gotten this question, so I stopped a minute before settling on \u2018oh, I never told them\u2019. I mean, obviously, right. I\u2019m not ashamed of my actions or anything, I just don\u2019t feel like everyone has the right to know. She was floored, asking how I could possibly keep such a thing from them since \u2018it\u2019s not a secret if you\u2019re telling me, you barely know me!\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re the grandparents they have the right!\u2019 \u2018You probably would have told them if you weren\u2019t ashamed\u2019 blah blah blah.The topic quickly went south, and we haven\u2019t spoken since.

It\u2019s your story/ experience to share and you get to choose who you share it with. You don\u2019t want to share it with them and that\u2019s completely valid.", "NTA.\n\nYou are an adult.  Your health is YOUR private business, and you share it with whomever you choose.   If you are comfortable sharing it with your parents, by all means share.  But they do not have a \"right\" to that information.  Having a child does not mean you own them for life and are entitled to invade their privacy even when they are adults.  Plenty of parents are either poor support systems or are downright bad for the mental health of their own children.\n\nI'd seriously rethink whether this new \"friend\" is someone you want to stick with, however.   I'd stay no-contact with her in your shoes.", "NTA and where does this \u201cfriend\u201d get off with that attitude?! Omg do not listen to them. You tell people you want when you want, and it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.", "NTA. That is a very personal thing and very traumatic. It is your decision who you tell.", "NTA. I had a miscarriage and only a handful of people know about it.", "NTA/NAH, depending on whether the other party is that \"friend\" or your parents.\n\nYou aren't an AH for not telling your parents, although the more people you tell, the more likely it is they'll find out.\n\nYour parents aren't AHs, or at least there's no evidence either way.\n\nThe new \"friend\" jumped to some unnecessary conclusions, so AH.", "NTA. This friend doesn't seem very mature. It's pretty obvious when someone says they find a topic upsetting that there's a reason they find it upsetting. A lot of people have had miscarriages or other losses or can't get pregnant when they want to. It's a common trigger. I feel like not pressing people who say they have a hard time around pregnancy and related topics is something most grown ups know how to do. \n\n And which is it? Are people supposed to have rights over their own bodies or are they obligated to tell everyone in their family everything about their reproductive lives? \n\nWhat's with the bossy therapist too?", "NTA\n\nI am sure you had reasons for not telling your parents.  If they were a safe place to fall/loving and accepting kind of parents, you may have told them.  But I assume they aren't.  And honestly, no one has a \"right\" to know this kind of thing.  \n\nAlso, this friend seems awfully judgmental and overly critical of your life.  I'm thinking you can move swiftly on and cut her out of your life.", "I can\u2019t believe some of these replies. No you\u2019re NTA. Your miscarriage and everything about how you decide to handle it are YOUR and ONLY YOUR business. Your friend however is a majorly judgemental AH who needs to mind her business. I\u2019d reconsider having any relationship with this person. She sounds toxic. You don\u2019t owe anybody an explanation for your actions in response to a miscarriage that ONLY YOU went through.", "I'm going to hazard a guess and assume they never knew you were pregnant to begin with. Working with that assumption I'm going to say NTA.\n\nI feel your pain acutely and I believe your parents don't need that heartbreak. That being said, remember that secrets have a way of coming to light, so they might find out one day and that will be a bridge you will have to cross when you get to it.", "NTA.  In the future it would probably be wise not to open up to people who have already demonstrated themselves to be judgmental asses.", "NTA\n\nTBH she crossed some conversational line a couple times in that one conversation. \n\nAssuming things without letting you explain. \nBeing nasty over those assumptions. \nAsking about your parents. \nJudging you about your decisions. \n\nShe sound like an ass hole, TBH. And if she shoved this much rude in one conversation, I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d want to be friends with her for very long.", "Info: how are your parents? How is your relationship with them? Do you get along, do you speak/visit regularly? Would you say they are good, normal, parents?\n\nNormally your mother should be the first person to go for support, assuming a regular parent, issue-free relationship.\n\nIt's very sad that at 19, barely an adult, you cannot trust your parents enough to talk to them about this (that's why I'm thinking they aren't exactly the ideal parent, and they're maybe why you're in therapy).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Traumatizing events are very personal, and you are not obligated to tell anyone about it. Honestly though the way this person reacted when you said you preferred not to discuss babies or hear jokes about babies and abortions should have been a clue that this is not a person that you should go to for advice.  I am militantly pro choice, but I\u2019m not going to lash out at someone who says they don\u2019t want to discuss babies. No reasonable person would.

I know so many women who have miscarried and they always choose how and when to tell people and whether or not to include their family or friends.

Only you know your parents and it\u2019s your story to tell. \n\nThis person with whom you were talking to has absolutely no idea what it\u2019s like to miscarry and the privilege of you choosing to tell her.

It\u2019s incredibly common.", "Ummmmm HELLO yeah ur username says it all cuz u must be on crank and u aint got no spark behind the eyes. She said she was pregnant. A fucking late period isnt a pregnancy. Ive had 8 miscarriages, some very early after only a week pregnant BUT I WAS FUCKING PREGNANT. Ur body experiences hormonal changes, i would get morning sickness before even a missed period. Ya fakin DONKEY", "Your friend seems very judgmental. It your story to tell."]}
