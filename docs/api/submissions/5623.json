When the dog chewed up my old stuffed animal to a point beyond repair and I was heartbroken, he took me to one of his friends house and she had made me a new one that looked similar and wasn\u2019t stuffed and they had me stuff the remaining bits of my old one into it and I still sleep with it every night. He got my ears checked and I got hearing aids after an incident with my moms boyfriend before him.

It\u2019s about paying attention to the the small/huge things that make the most difference. The stuffed toy thing killed me. As someone else said here, don\u2019t give up on your mom, tough.

I hope for the best for you and your new family.", "NTA - Mom seems neglectful & abusive, Jake seems like caring individual. At 16 depending where you are, you don't need her permission (where I am at 16 you can just relive yourself from parental control) its your younger brother that could be a problem if your mother does not give parental rights to Jake.\n\nAlso, mother or not being blood does not excuse being shitty if anything mothers/fathers should be held to a higher standard of behavior towards their children.", "NTA.  This is a big decision for someone so young, but sounds like you've got your head on straight.", "NTA, however you do need to be cautious.  Mom does not sound stable, and Jake has no parental rights.  She could report you kidnapped, accuse his of molestation, or other things to get him into trouble.  If this is something Jake wants to do, he needs to see an attorney as soon as possible and do it legally.", "NTA but try to leave open a line of communication with your mom. She may say now that she never wants to see you again, but she almost certainly doesn\u2019t mean it.\n\nThat said, if I had a choice between a parental figure who had kicked me out overnight and one who never had, I know which one I would choose.\n\nGood luck. Jake sounds like a good man.", "NTA!! You remind me of my younger self actually, I was in a similar situation. My dad loves and cares about me but he struggles a lot with mental illness. He and my stepmother separated years ago and me, my brother and sister stayed with her. Once he was stable my lil bro moved back with him and my sister and I are now adults and still visit. My situation was temporary due to his untreated bipolar disorder but I still couldn't stay in that situation, and you shouldn't either. Do what's best for you. If the courts get involved (Edit: They should be. This all needs to be handled legally to prevent the nastier side of custody disputes of course) you're at an age where you'll likely be listened to compared to a 5 year old who doesn't understand divorce. Step-parents who truly love you are a blessing not everyone gets, fight like hell to keep him in your life, he sounds more than willing to do the same for you.", "NTA, not even a little bit. You should do what's best for you, not your awful sounding mom.", "NTA Stay with whoever provides the most stable, drama free life. Where you can be calm without being berated. The person who provides a calm, stable environment is more family than the one that doesn't. I would have done anything to have grown up away from my mother, even if that meant boarding school like the neighbour's kids did. Family is who you decide is family, over DNA.", "Youre not the asshole in any way shape or form, but I could understand how to most people that dynamic might be abit odd, however thats kinda how foster care works too.

Mom should have lost custody and been imprisoned for neglect/complicity in child abuse. Some doors you don't close, but other doors you slam shut.  Stick with Jake, OP.  Don't look back.  \n\nIf this is the U.S. and the custody issue goes to court, ask for a guardian ad litem to be appointed for you.

If someone caused that kind of harm to my children, I'd have done everything possible to help them after, not wait until an adultier adult stepped up to the plate. I would also understand if they didn't want to see me bring men around and would accommodate that. Her mother isn't even trying to understand her children and their position, and she's not doing anything to make them feel safer in their own home.

Yeah. I\u2019m really not myself today. Must be the Christmas wine. You\u2019re totally correct. Abuse should not be tolerated. Thank you for pointing that out."]}
