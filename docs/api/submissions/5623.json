And the ultimatum I get it hurts your mom, but ultimatums, especially like that, never help. \n\nAnd in an unrelated note, I\u2019m a hard of hearing woman engineer and I just want to encourage you to continue pursuing it. I love the career and always want to see more women and deaf people in it.", "One of my high school friends did the same. Her mom was 15 when she was born and they struggled a lot; at one point lived in a house with another single mom and her kids, then her mom got married and when they divorced my friend lived with her ex-stepdad because it was better than with her mom.", "NTA \n\nThat guy was basically your dad and you did form a bond with him. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to let him go. Sounds like your mom messed up and let one of the good ones go. Hope he\u2019s able to get custody because it he sounds like a good guy and was more of a parent to you anyways.", "I'm actually crying reading about all the things he did for her. He really stepped up. I want him to be my parent and I'm the same age as him lol", "This 100%. NTA", "I disagree. OP doesn\u2019t owe her mother a damn thing particularly given that she needs hearing aids because of something one of her mother\u2019s ex\u2019s did to her. As far as future relationships go, it\u2019s on the mother to do all of the work. OP doesn\u2019t need to leave anything open to her mother - if the mother wants a relationship, she can rebuild the whole damn bridge herself", "Ya that comment was disturbing to say the least. It's abuse and domestic violence. That too on children. I think Jake is an amazing person. Just wish you and your brother are safe and well cared for with him.", "Thank you for this comment. You\u2019re very kind and understanding to my ignorant comment. I read the post too fast, kinda happy with the Christmas wine and overlooked the many terrible things OP suffered at the hands of her mother. And instead of berating me, you took the time to educate me.", "NTA for wanting to live with him \n\nBut you're 16 and he was never married to your mom\n\nSo legally he doesn't have a leg to stand on to take custody of you.. and I don't think a judge would gleefully send you to live with an unrelated male.. even if he has been a father - figure in your life.\n\nYou could research emancipation though.", "It looks like you have a great dad figure to raise you so you can stay away from your toxic mother. Good luck to you.", "NTA - Jake has been your father. Blood doesn\u2019t define family. Go live with him and have the stable home you deserve.", "NTA.", "NTA. Everything you describe in Jake is the behavior of a dad. He\u2019s your dad. It\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t want to call him that. But he has chosen to be that to you. You would not be choosing your mother\u2019s ex over your mom; you would be choosing your dad, and yourself. And that\u2019s ok. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad for that. \n\nYou need to do what is best for you. That\u2019s what Jake is trying to do as well. He obviously wants what is best for you and your brother. The right thing to do isn\u2019t always the easy thing to do. But sometimes we have to do difficult things to give ourselves the best chance at a better life.", "Your mom clearly cares more about her boyfriends than you, her own children. I'd say yes go stay with him.", "NTA. I think you're old enough to start making those decisions. As someone with a biological mom who fucked things up with shitty boyfriends as well, if there is a real opportunity for stability and security I would have jumped on it.", "Moving out is the right thing to do. Gotta make it legal and also get the mother on the hook for child support.", "You're not paranoid, you're straight raving delusional.", "And she throws around the disown card too easy and kicked her out of the house immediately.", "Happy Cake Day!", "Op Go!! You and your brother  both need out of that house. Any woman who puts men and dating above  kids doesn't need them! Jake was the one to take care of you and be there for you when you need someone, he wants y'all and it sounds to me like your Mom doesn't.", "Been in the exact same place. I chose the boyfriend. Was fine until they got back together and my\u201djake\u201d kicked me out. I hope you have a better jake and set boundaries with your mother. I still try to have a real relationship with her but it\u2019s near impossible and I have to maintain the boundaries to not get sucked into the bullshit. Good luck i went through it at 17 so I was able to bounce and couch surf til I figured out what to do. 37 now feels like lifetimes ago. I barely talk to either of them and I\u2019m pretty happy about it at this point. It helps my wife\u2019s family is awesome so I got to see what a healthy family looked and feels like. In case it\u2019s not clear you are not the Asshole.", "NTA Such a hard situation, the choice that is safest for you and your brother in both the short and long term is the way to go. Remember to talk to Jake about the long-term plans before you two make the move.", "NTA!", "NTA- ignore all the family is blood BS you can hear about I in movies etc. it\u2019s just a blank cheque for people to mistreat others.\nFamily is who is there for you cuz they care and love you. I\u2019m glad to hear that you have someone wonderful that you deserve. \nPlease make sure you get all your important things together when you leave, it may be very difficult to retrieve anything that gets left behind.", "NTA.\n\nJake sounds awesome! I wish you and your brother all happiness living with him. Your mother has done this to herself. Her insanity is not your problem!", "Nta. Both you and your brother deserve to feel safe and happy. Trust me when i say i know where you are coming from and at your age you shouldnt have to be living in fear. You deserve better. Look into your state laws and see what you can do to have him becoe. Your legal guardian. If your mom wants to disown you see if she will sign over rights. That way she cant try to pu something down the road. Do you have any family you can talk to as well about 2hats go8ng on?", "The bar\u2019s really low these days and some people (like op\u2019s mom) still can\u2019t even reach it.", "The bar is in hell and ops mom is stretching out to limbo"]}
