English isn\u2019t my first language either, but I wouldn\u2019t go around speaking my native language if my friends couldn\u2019t understand it and felt excluded", "Yeah, that's inconsiderate on their part.", "They are not your friends.  They are friends to each other and you\u2019re an afterthought.  Peacefully disengage and find people who value you. NTA, but also not gonna change.", "English is my third language.  I learned to read and write English from age 5 and have now been living in an English speaking country for over a decade. Initially, I had to translate English to my second language then vice versa. Now, save for conversations with my family of origin, I speak almost exclusively English and for a while now, my thoughts /inner dialogue have also been in English.\n\nYet, I have come to realise that many, many English words so not have the same emotional resonance for me. And every so often, when excited, sad or angry, I find it difficult to stick to English and it has happened that a few non-English words would slip out! \n\nI am about to get nerdy here but there have been studies demonstrating that people felt that their personalities came across differently when speaking different languages. Perhaps this is something that comes into play?\n\nAnyway, the invites are a good sign but clearly, your friends need to revise their etiquette ...\n\nNTA, borderline ESH.", "Since English is also not your native language, I'd say they aren't your friends.", "Why? English is the common language we share, so it\u2019s common courtesy to speak it. And yes, their English is better than mine because they grew up speaking it at international school", "OP's first language isn't english.  English is their common language.", "I bet you 100% that if you never reached out to them again, you also wouldn\u2019t hear from them again.", "If they wanna speak in their native tongue then you can't force them to speak English. I would find new friends or learn their language considering they prefer Mandarin.", "I have a bunch of Chinese inlaws and if I could have arranged to get the sort of exposure OP has I'd have jumped at it (as it is, they prefer to communicate in bad English).  Chinese is a hell of an important language and there aren't enough opportunities to get casually immersed in it.", "Seems like you\u2019re pretty smart then! Maybe you shouldn\u2019t write off you ability to learn a little mandarin. But sure \ud83e\udd14 If you\u2019ve made up your mind you\u2019re just better and they\u2019re just rude, it all seems like much ado, and you should just walk away.", "My apologies. By the way this post was made, it made me think you were native English- speaking westerner. I shouldn't have assumed that, and I'm sorry. \n\nStill, I can sense a tiny bit of entitlement. They don't have to talk to you at all, y'know?  You also don't have to hang out with them. They may be rich and speak perfect english, but it doesn't mean they don't face any pressure or racism. It doesn't mean they don't struggle every once and while with language.", "How many languages do you currently speak?", "No you wouldn't. You would do exactly what they are doing.", "Telling someone to not speak their own language around you is entitled. They are free to speak whatever language they want.", "Really? If all but one of your friends living in a different country spoke your mother tongue. You would all speak English for one friend? \ud83d\ude44 You realize that expats seek each other for a reason?", "That\u2019s how I feel. It\u2019s obvious speaking in a language that I don\u2019t understand would mean I\u2019m essentially excluded from the conversation and they don\u2019t really care", "English is also my third language so I understand perfectly what you mean about certain turns of phrase or words simply not being able to be expressed in English.", "Asian here, who's lived is SEA most of my life. I have lots of Chinese friends, some of whom speak better Cantonese than English. They always spreak in English when I'm around, and only use Cantonese words when they can't find the English equivalent. They'll then immediately explain what it means in English. I've never had to ask them to do that, it's basic etiquette in most parts of the world.", "This is completely NTA  this is nowhere near ESH your just injecting your own personal feelings instead of sticking to the facts of the post", "You might be right", "Second this", "Yes I see that now. Well if they insist on speaking Mandarin what can you do.", "I\u2019m not sure, the confusing thing is they\u2019re always the ones that invite me out most of the time. They even paid for a plane ticket for me to go on a spring break trip with them last year", "Didn\u2019t say I could force them. Just that excluding me is a dick move", "Not really, I\u2019m a product of my environment. So are they, they\u2019re rich kids that went to international school and grew up speaking English as much as mandarin, so their English is even better than mine", "No worries.\n\nAnd yes, they don\u2019t have to talk to me, but if they\u2019re going out of their way to invite me to stuff, the assumption is that they talk to me during that stuff", "Even if this person only spoke English, it is rude to invite someone to hang out with you and exclude them completely from the conversation.\n\nIn bird culture, this is considered a dick move.", "It literally does not matter at all if OP was a westerner. If you\u2019re in a group with people, speak a language that everyone speaks. Not doing that is excluding people.", "Three", "No, I wouldn\u2019t, because excluding friends due to refusing to speak a language I\u2019m fluent at is a dick move", "She's not doing that though. They are out as a group and then leave out OP of everything by not including the in the conversation. It's not like OP is going up to strangers and telling them to speak English.", "You don't live in the real world do you?\n\nThis isn't a case where he's hearing people speak their own language and butting in. He's supposed to be an active part of the conversation, and can't do that because they're literally forgetting to include him.\n\nI say this as someone who speaks both Spanish and English and has dealt with teachers punishing the spanish speaking kids at school. I've translated conversations before with English only and Spanish only friends. If I didn't translate and actively engage them in the conversation, they'd be left out. Like OP.", "Yes, I\u2019ve had situations like that with other Indian students and non Indian friends, and I\u2019ve always spoken English because it\u2019s rude to exclude", "It is rude to exclude someone if you\u2019re in a group conversation, yes.", "Yeah cause you're not their friend, they don't *want* you in the conversation. They may be friends with each other but if every conversation could be had without you, you're not a part of the friend group dude.", "I'm going to get a lot of shit for this, but...I live in the US and in a very diverse area.  I've noticed that the ten to mid 20 Asian folks really tend to stick to their own.  It could be finding their identity and their own folks, especially if they went to schools that didn't have a huge asian population.  No idea.  It's just an observation specific to my area.", "Are these girls well off or have wealthy family back home? (I'm going to assume so or they'd be receiving schooling in China). It really sounds like they want a foreigner around to brag about it back home.", "So don't be friends. They seem to not be comfortable speaking English. Sometimes people are jerks and exclude others. Nothing you can do to change that.", "Fair play tbh\u2014- I\u2019ve learnt the culture gap can be pretty wide but if its as you say, then maybe time to change groups. Good luck!", "You obviously haven't thought that maybe, while they are your friends, you're not really theirs.", "Like I told OP, they may be his friends but he may not be theirs.", "[removed]", "Okay. So according to your standards, you have chosen a \u201crude\u201d group of friends. Perhaps you need to move on. Alternately, you could accept your friend group for who they are, accepting the fact that they are going to use a mix of Mandarin and English. Continue to ask for translation and take a mandarin class.", "That\u2019s entirely fine if they stop inviting me to stuff. But what\u2019s the point of constantly inviting me to stuff, to the extent of dropping hundreds of dollars on a plane ticket so I can go with them on spring break, just to ignore me?", "this!! i'm chinese and my friend group is mixed with some chinese students too. we only speak mandarin if its just us chinese students. as long as there is 1 non-mandarin speaking person around we will speak english so they don't get left out... OP NTA but the \"friends\" are\n\n*edit: typos", "Yeah honestly I\u2019ve noticed the same", "Well with all the anti Asian hate crimes recently sounds like the smart thing to do.", "That\u2019s the solution, yes. But if they\u2019re jerks in this situation, why YTA?", "Thank you", "That\u2019s certainly a possibility. But calling somebody a friend and then treating them in a way that's exclusive is still a dick move", "They paid for a plane ticket for OP, so I would think that they are on a friend level. Plus they are inviting OP to these gatherings and then leaving them out of the socializing part of the group. But in the same token OP has an obligation to contribute to the conversation, and not just stand idly by waiting to be included.", "You sure do have fun trying to be snarky on the internet, huh?", "Sure, I could do either. But what does that have to do with the fact their actions are rude to begin with?", "Yeah nah dude, these people suck. I've been that friend, it's not worth it.", "Honestly I think it sounds like they like you, but don't care about you. Like, they like having you around but they don't care enough to consider what your experience of it will be.\n\nSo, like, from their perspective, when they want to interact with you, they can switch to English, and you're right there ready to be interacted with. \n\nA bit like I will bring my knitting on vacation with me because I like knitting, but I don't really think about if my knitting gets upset if I forget it in my bag. I interact with it when I feel like it, and don't think about it's experience of things. Where the difference of course is that my knitting projects don't actually have feelings like an actual human being does.\n\nI think they might just be selfish and clueless rather than evil. Unfortunately the impact on you is the same, and that's what actually matters.\n\nEdit: And if they're able to spend hundreds of dollars to bring you on spring break, that suggests that they're the sort of people who can do that without it being too much of a problem, and people with a lot of money tend to also be more self centered. Also, if they pay to have you around, they might feel even more entitled to having their own way, since that makes for a pretty clear power dynamic", "They\u2019re inviting you because they consider you a friend, but they\u2019re not willing to change how they socialize as a group for you. If you don\u2019t like it, then this is not the social group for you.", "I guess ESH, they aren't being considerate but you could learn Mandarin instead of this. I don't know what your goal was after getting justification, that they would change? I honestly would prefer to speak my native tongue too if I had other friends who understood me.", "Thank you for that stirring condemnation of human tendencies.", "It's a hobby. Not good enough to go pro.", "You are not responsible for their actions. Only for how you feel about them. I disagree that they are being rude, but that is merely my opinion. I recognize yours and understand your viewpoint. You cannot change people who are unwilling to change. If they do not see your side of things or at minimum acknowledge your side and strive to give more translation, they do not view your friendship in the same way you view it. That hurts. But they have chosen the way they want to be. Perhaps your sadness at their unwillingness to adapt to your request is a sign that these are not the friends you had hoped they would be.", "Yeah fair enough. But I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s the point of them inviting me", "I mean I just think \u2018learn one of the most complex languages in the world from scratch instead of the people that know English fluently speaking English\u2019 isn\u2019t the most efficient solution. I get their desire to speak their native language, English isn\u2019t my native language either, but it just feels inconsiderate when they invite me and then ignore me", "I\u2019m not sure what point you\u2019re trying to make. Something being a human tendency doesn\u2019t make it automatically a good thing to do", "Clearly", "But I still don\u2019t see how that\u2019s relevant to a question of who\u2019s the asshole in the scenario.", "Who knows? Sometimes it's to keep up appearances or to phase someone out slowly. Maybe they just want to dismiss your concerns because they're being stubborn. Either way you don't have to put up with it.\n\nJust hang out with them less, if they notice and care they'll reach out to you and try to include you. If they don't then the friendship will just fade away. Sometimes it's for the best.", "So stop being friends, the kids at my school speak their native language all the time. I don't care, if I wanna understand them I'll learn at least a few phrases for context. They don't care about you, idk what to tell ya.", "Well now we\u2019re going in circles.\n\nI think that demanding your friend group speak English is gross! You believe they\u2019re being rude, I disagree. You\u2019re feeling excluded and you want to feel comfortable. But that\u2019s not the reality and the group has told you their thoughts. You are refusing to accept that. YTA! Could they be assholes as well, sure. But it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that they straight up told you \u201cno\u201d and you refuse to accept that.", "Yeah, it\u2019s a strange situation overall\u2014 inviting me to spring break in Thailand, buying an expensive plane ticket, then basically ignoring me to speak amongst themselves. And your advice is right, thank you", "Once again, sure, that\u2019s the solution, but where am I TA here for wanting to be included? And besides it\u2019s different when it\u2019s just \u2018kids at your school\u2019 vs explicitly being invited out and then ignored. The latter (being invited out) implies that they\u2019ll include you while the former doesn\u2019t", "When did I \u2018demand\u2019 it, or refuse to accept that they said no?"]}
