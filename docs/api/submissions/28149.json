The issue emerges when my brother didn\u2019t come to pick up my nephew that night so I called my brother and his wife multiple times but neither answered so I gave up and set up the living room so that I could sleep near my nephew and I would try again in the morning but next day came and same thing I called and called but no response again so I had to skip class again and once again bight comes and I spend the night watching my nephew now we\u2019re on the third day and I\u2019m pissed because if I miss this day I\u2019ll have to retake the class at this point I\u2019m blowing up his phone and suddenly my calls and texts stop going through so I start panicking and I resort to having to strap my nephew in his car seat and driving over to my brothers mother in law\u2019s house and beg her to watch him for a couple hours so I can go to class to which she agrees and I go to class.
