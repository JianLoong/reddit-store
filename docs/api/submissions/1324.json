You have a child of your own to take care of. Someone's child is no one's responsibility, but the parent's.", "Your mom is out of line. SHE can step up, or the mother who is choosing to have the child, or the father... a lot of people are in line ahead of you. \n\nThis is the sort of thing to go low contact over. I wouldn't tolerate my family abusing me over messages and calls because I'm not bowing down to the golden child. Especially if I have my own child. Can you just not answer their calls and block them for a bit?", "Nta.\n\n You have your own.. she chose this... her mom and man  can help", "I think you know you aren't the AH. She (and hopefully a partner) are the only ones responsible for their childcare. If your parents are pro helping family, then that should be plenty of extra help.", "NTA\n\nShe showed her ass when you asked her for help and she had to get her lashes done...", "NTA, 100%.  You don't treat people like shit and then expect help in return. Don't let them manipulate you. She's more concerned with what's between his legs than the quality of life he will have. She is extremely selfish.", "are you the AH for not taking on the task of being a primary caretaker for your nephew? no, of course not, and i think - or hope - you know that. if you\u2019re just here seeking validation of your choice, i\u2019m happy to provide it: you are entirely within your rights to decline her demand that you take care of her child. \n\nif, however, you sincerely think you are obligated to give in to this unreasonable demand, then i would gently suggest that you take some time and space to yourself, or with a therapist, to unpack the deep family dynamics at play here. you mention your sister is the golden child - i\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time she has made such demands of you, and i suspect you may not always hold your boundaries. \n\nwishing you, and your soon-to-be nephew, the best. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Absolutely die on this hill.", "NTA \n\nNobody should feel guilty about not signing up to take care of their sibling's child for the rest of their life. Your sister has made her decision ama and that is fine since it's her decision. It wasn't your decision and you aren't ever responsible or obligated to donate your life to her kid.\n\nShe hasn't thought through how hard this is going to be, and that's obvious when she is already pre planning how other people are going to \"help\". She is so selfish.", "INFO: Do you and your sister live together? And where is her husband?", " NTA\n\nHer decision not to terminate a severely disabled birth means she is responsible for what is required. Especially since she has been so callous to her own family. And if the doctors are right, the baby won\u2019t live long enough to argue about it. Please, however, do provide emotional support when she grieves the loss.", "NTA. Apart from the dysfunctional dynamics, your hands are already full with your own child. Also you eventually would become the only family member caring for nephew. Shut that down.", "NTA. Yes honey, die on this hill!!! Kudos for not complying cause you're \"family \". Family my ass, it's all fun and games until they need help. You sis fucked around and found out that not everything is about her.", "That's a little far. I 100% agree OP is NTA and should not be forced to help, but calling the sister a horrible mother is too much... My daughter was deemed incompatible with life when I was 5 months preg due to anencephaly and I chose to listen to doctors and have an early, induced labor, but I 100% understand why some mothers go full term, even just to have a minute with their child. I wouldn't wish the PTSD I have after my experience on my worst enemy. It's a really difficult situation to be in.", "Thanks for this. I actually DO need therapy and am looking into it! The whole family dynamic is f-d up and it\u2019s only the last few years I\u2019ve really started to see it more and more- it was just the norm in my youth and I was passive and just let them walk over me. There\u2019s been quite a few blow ups since I\u2019ve started to stand my ground which is another reason why I\u2019ve questioned myself whether this fight is worth it if that makes sense? I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019s held to a different regard than I am but it\u2019s something that\u2019s making me want to distance myself more and more, but the old childhood stuff comes back and I feel like I\u2019m the one in the wrong for rocking the boat, making my kid miss out, \u201cspiting the kids\u201d and things like that and then I usually end up crumbling and giving in again to keep peace until the next inevitable time.", "No we live about 30 minutes away by car a few towns over. I live with my husband and child. She has her husband but he\u2019s really passive and doesn\u2019t really say a lot, he puts her on a pedestal even when she does stuff wrong. Go figure", "He's planning the vacations they won't be taking their future son on while his wife is lining up the childcare.", "Of course it depends on what exactly is wrong with the child. \nBut i for one would not want put a severely disabled child into this world that will have to be supervised 24/7.", "it totally makes sense. i\u2019m childfree myself, but have heard from a number of people that they didn\u2019t start questioning their family dynamics until they had children of their own. and the reactions of your family members make sense, too. they\u2019ve likely spent decades being able to bend you to their whim, and when you finally start setting some boundaries, it\u2019s jarring for them. (what do you MEAN you won\u2019t agree to parent my special needs child? you do everything i demand of you!) the important thing to remember about boundaries is that you cannot control the behavior of others - all you have control over is your response. \u201csister, i would love to come visit you and nephew with x frequency, but i cannot agree to be a primary caregiver for him. i am not going to change my mind. i don\u2019t want to do this, but if you continue to bring it up, i will have to end the conversation.\u201d and then - most importantly - follow through.", "NTA. Keep practicing! It gets easier every time you say no. And who says your kids have to miss out? Miss out on a grip of dysfunction? Yes, please!", "So the husband won't be able to help with the baby because he'll be too busy planning vacations?", "Um, you don't understand sarcasm and humor very well, do you?", "It would appear not.", "You know what? I think you should definitely keep up this tit for tat relationship you have with your sister. Keep up the good work."]}
