The child itself will always feel that they are burdening others even if they can't communicate.

The only people I would want to help in this situation is her daughters.  You are not the ahole.  They gave no right to expect you to support her choices.  The fact she didn't help when your child was sick just is an added reason not to help.  But if you can be a support or escape for your neices I would fo that.", "NTA and you wouldn't be even if the child was perfectly healthy. No one is entitled to your help with caring for their own kids.", "NTA Even without the back story. You have a child who needs you.", "NTA and what your sister is doing to this baby and her three daughters is awful. The impact to their lives is going to cause many many posts from those girls on here.", "NTA. First of all, why is it your automatic responsibility to help out your sister\u2019s children, disabled or not? Sure, if you wanted to offer your time and support that\u2019s great but YOUR choice. This is your sister\u2019s decision to have this child. Her responsibility. Not your duty. Your mother needs to take a massive step back and stop playing favourites. Tell her this is your boundary and she needs to respect that or you go low contact. Do not be forced into someone else\u2019s choice.", "NTA", "even if he makes it his life is not going to be pleasant", "she will be like the mom who made any family event about the dead brother", "And guess who will be parentified and later expected to help shoulder the load when they\u2019re grown? If mom expects this of OP she\u2019ll certainly expect it of her daughters.", "NTA .   \nPush all your asshole family off your fucking hill!!!!!!!!!", "NTA \nKeep practicing saying No. Your son and you need each other more than you need the rest of your family. Enjoy your lashes appointment.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know why people are surprised and angry when you treat them in return, how they treated you.", "Nta", "\"My mom was telling me how it\u2019s my duty to help care for the baby when he arrives (he\u2019s due soon) a\" ... You DON'T!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake care of your own family, and ignore your AH mom and your sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. She cares more about having a biological son to parade around than how her severely disabled child is going to suffer for the rest of his life. Some pregnancies sadly aren\u2019t meant to come to full-term", "NTA. Not that humans are animals but if she chose to adopt a dog with massive behavior issues it would be wrong for her to assume you\u2019d be willing to spend your time and energy helping her raise it. I don\u2019t know why her choosing to have a child that will by definition take massive amounts of effort and time and energy is something you need to be responsible for.", "NTA, shes incredibly selfish and cruel... letting her son suffer and maybe have a very short painful life just because she wants a little boy? Hate to break it to her... but kids arent born to fulfill yoir qants and needs... they are little HUMANS.", "NTA and after reading your comments please don't let them walk all over you. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.", "Nta wow honestly i would go nc with these assholes", "I used to work with special needs, and one family had a severely disabled child that required round-the-clock care. It seriously took a village of people to take care of that child. I hope your sister has GOOD insurance, because a nurse on hand at all hours adds up. As for the siblings,  you can guess what their new roll will become. That family was lovely,  but it was emotionally draining always worrying about that baby. I hope the family is ready for the addition, and everything that comes with. \n\nNTA", "You stand on that hill loud and proud. The only AH is your sister for bringing a child into this world and expecting everyone else to look after him, it\u2019s bad enough she\u2019s continuing to keep popping out kids just to get the boy she wants. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: wrong gender", "I feel for OP and her nephew, but also for the three little girls that are about to be completely sidelined.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

That is a brutal existence. Can you get access to respite care where you are?", "The petty malicious side of me just absolutely LOVES this idea. Please do it. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude08", "And there\u2019s no way these poor girls don\u2019t know that their mother wanted a son desperately.", "I think the only reason she didn't terminate is bc the fetus is a boy. She's being selfish. And saying the family will help is out of line. This was her choice to make so she should be the one to care for him, if he even survives past birth. I feel so bad for her other kids bc on the off chance he does survive she's going to expect them to give up their lives to help with him."]}
