That's actually very weird.", "Easiest NTA ever.", "I\u2019ve been doing some brainstorming and I think the reason they want me to have a guest room is so they can come over and have me wait on them hand and foot", "All the more reason to not turn it into a guest room!", "Are they subsidizing your rent and living expenses? NTA, f**k \u2018em.", "Put a trundle bed under the couch.  Guest room achieved.", "NTA- it's YOUR  home.  Yours to decide what to do with, how to decorate and live in.  Shoot, I'm 41 and I don't have a guest room simply to keep guests out. Jk, I'm divorced and can't afford a bigger place.", "NTA. We have a spare bedroom, mostly because either the spouse or I end up in the other room half the nights. Snoring, tossing and turning, etc. It's comfortable, and we can afford the space. If the in-laws visit, they can stay in a hotel.", "NTA. Tell them if they\u2019d like to pay for the all of the moving fees and the difference in rent every month to get you a 3 bedroom apartment and furniture, you\u2019ll gladly have a guest room, otherwise they can shut the fuck up and mind their own homes.", "NTA\n I bought my house with enough bedrooms, not extra, on purpose. My mil literally asked us to finish and heat the basement so she could come stay. Thats like tens of thousands of dollars. NOPE", "NTA! It\u2019s your place not theirs! And you\u2019re exactly right. Why would you host when you have least space?!?!", "NTA\n\nI have never heard of anything in etiquette which requires that one have a dedicated guest room in lieu of using a room that provides comfort and functionality to the full time resident.\n\nMost people I know don't have an extra room that at is used for nothing but housing guests. If they are lucky they get to sleep on the pull out sofa or blow up mattress in a room with a door\n\nAnyone who feels that you should keep an empty room on the off chance that someone wants to stay in it, should pay you the difference in cost for your getting a place with a third bedroom to keep empty.", "NTA,  its your place and you shoukd use it as you eish.", "We have a futon in my fiance's office/game room. And not one person has used it outside of us. \n\nUnless you have people from out of town that visit or just extra space then you don't need a guest room", "Tell your family when they pay 1/2 the rent you will set up a guest room.  Screw them.   You don't need a guest room.  Someone can stay on your couch if they need a place to stay", "NTA. Your family are out of touch with modern reality.", "So NTA. That\u2019s your space to do as you please. Buy a sleeping bag and tell them if they have to stay over they can sleep on the floor.", "NTA. Throw a pillow in the tub and bada bing Bada boom, guest room", "NTA but it feels like a futon or a pullout couch might solve your problems?", "NTA. It's yours, not theirs. Tell them if they want to pay you rent on the room, they can decide what goes in it.", "NTA\n\nYour home; you get to decide what to do with the rooms. \n\nI (35f) own my two bedroom home. One of those rooms is my \"office\" (aka my gaming pc, bookshelves, and collectibles). My family knows if they visit in small numbers, I have a super long couch or inflatable mattress. If large numbers come to visit...there's a selection of hotels less than 10 minutes away.\n\nEdited because words", "NTA in some circumstances, I agree you should have guest space. But this doesn't seem like it'd be needed since there's other family close by.", "NTA. However, I would choose to stay at your place because the rest of your family sounds like a-holes.", "Ask yourself: Who is it they want to have move in with you?  \n\nNTA", "Why would anybody that doesn\u2019t live with you have a say in how you use the rooms of your own house (or apartment in this case)? It really doesn\u2019t matter what they think, does it? NTA", "NTA! They need to get off your back about this - you pay the rent, you spend the majority of your nights there, so your wishes and needs are the priority. \n\nWhen we moved & bought our most recent home, it was the first time in our 25 year marriage that we decided not to fret about the guest rooms. Spoiler alert, we have two, but they\u2019re really small (original to our 85 year old house) with tiny closets and a tiny retro but cute and perfectly functional bathroom. Our former house had large guest rooms with modem en-suite bathrooms and had a number of gigantic disadvantages over our current one. \n\nWe decided that we are the ones who live here full time, so while we want guests to feel welcome and comfy, we are not going to sacrifice our own space for it. The owner\u2019s suite is huge, and we also each got a spare room to use as an office. Does family visit? Yes, frequently! Do I worry because they aren\u2019t quite having a luxury hotel experience? No, and I sleep like a baby.", "NTA. Until they're paying the bills, they don't get a say in how you utilize your space. Tell them if it's such a big deal, they can kick in on the rent.", "NTA. If they want you to have a place where you can have an extra room for them, they can damn well pay for it themselves.", "NTA. Keep your media room!", "NTA. Your paying for the apartment so it\u2019s your choice to arrange it how you want. And you\u2019re not selfish for it! When they pay your rent, utilities and food, then they can decide. Until then, you\u2019re not a bit selfish!", "You would have a guest room if you wanted overnight guests.  NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re paying for it, they\u2019re not. You\u2019re allowed to use the space you pay for how you want.", "NTA - Once they put their names on the lease and pay rent, then fine.\n\nIf not then no, you can't dictate how my home looks to your pleasure.", "NTA. Having a dedicated guestroom in a small apartment is just ridiculous. If you ever have a guest, a small inflatable air mattress or something like that would totally be enough.", "NTA is your house, or appt here, you get to make your choices and if they really want to stay THAT BAD they can sleep on the couch", "NTA I turned my guest room into an extra office. \n\nNow if guests come they have the choice of a king air mattress / sectional in the living room or a hotel. The best thing is that only the people I actually want and who are extremely good friends visit.", "NTA \n\n\nDon't change it", "NTA\n\nIf they all want to chip in and pay up so you can rent an apt with a third bedroom, then they are free to do so.", "NTA\n\nPut an air mattress in your closet.  There ya go - guest room, ready in 3 minutes.", "Sounds similar to my place. 2 bedroom but I use one as a study/library.  There is no space even for a foldout couch. I don\u2019t host family stuff as my sister has a huge house. No one thinks that odd. \nNTA", "What husband wouldn\u2019t want a wife who has a room for her gaming consoles and entertainment center?", "I mean, Ikr who wouldn't. I just meant I could imagine mothers, grandmother's and aunts saying it", "NTA\n\nAre they trying to pawn someone off on you? Is there a cousin somewhere who no one wants to house?", "As someone who has no kids and 3 bedroom house with no guestrooms, NTA!  My space is mine and I have no desire to host any gatherings. If someone ever needs a space to crash I have two couches and an air mattress, but it's not my preference to be a habitual host.", "As Rupaul says, \"Unless they're paying your rent, don't pay those bitches no mind\".", "NO ONE GETS TO DECIDE WHAT YOU DO WHERE YOU PAY THE BILLS. They can have an opinion, however it will not be taken into consideration. If they visit here is a couch or go to a hotel. It's baffling how people really think others should have spaces for them at their homes. Even if you had a house what you do with all the rooms is your choice. Don't let no one come into space talking that mess.", "As a woman who owns a four bedroom house with one kid, a spouse, and no guestroom availability, i say screw your family and their expectations of how you ought to want to live. Nta at all.", "There is absolutely no reason at all why you should be expected to turn a room you currently use for your hobbies into a room for visitors. (especially if you weren't planning on having any). Your family seriously needs to back off about it, it's not their business. Your house, your rooms, your rules. It's as easy as that.", "NTA. \n\nI have a 3 bedroom house, and not one of those two extra bedrooms is a guest room.\n\nEnjoy your entertainment room.", "Swap the couch for a pullout couch, and viola. NTA even if you don't add the bed couch. Your house your wish.", "NTA. I\u2019m still stuck on people deciding things for YOUR apartment. Why on earth would they be hosting events at your place??? That\u2019s not up to them, it\u2019s up to you. Furthermore, my second room would be exactly what you did with your second room.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your house, and it's small. You do whatever you want to in your house. They do whatever they want in their house.", "NTA. Its your place, you can do whatever you want with it.", "Do they pay your bills? If not, tell them to kick rocks. If they do, tell them to kick rocks. Nta", "NTA\n\nThe possibility of family coming over is the best reason to not have a guest room. They can have a guest car park, at most.", "NTA it's your apartment, you get to do what you want in it and if you're not usually hosting anyways, then there would be no point in converting it into a guest room. Leave that to people with bigger places. I'm jealous btw I want a relaxation room! ;-;", "NTA. My daughters room since she has moved out is our sewing/craft room. It still has a bed and stuff in there but we have moved our craft stuff in there", "What complete bullshit. It\u2019s your place; use it as you choose. NTA.", "NTA \n\nin this economy?!", "NTA.  People in apartments don't generally have guest rooms.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure I would want one even in a big house... I would not want to give the impression that I am willing to host anyone for weeks at a time...", "NTA\n\nMy wife & I intentionally rented a smaller apartment and never got a couch so that her mom can't stay with us. If she comes into town she knows she has to stay at a hotel. (Long story, bad history)\n\nSince then we bought a house, which is still pretty small (but you can always find an extra corner for an air mattress in a house) so my wife just had to get more forward and explicitly tell her mom she can't stay with us when she's in town, and she hasn't. She stays at hotels.", "NTA. We don't have a guest room either. We are happily child free and we turned the extra spaces into a gym, an office, and a library. Because it's our house, and that's what we wanted. No one els has any say what you do with your space, unless maybe they're paying for it.", "NTA. \n\nI have a two bedroom apartment solely for me and my stuff. \nMy 2nd bedroom is just an extra closet / shit pile room where I hang laundry to dry. \n\nIt\u2019s your space to do as you please with.", "NTA and it\u2019s pretty clear why you have this set up. Boundaries are awesome, your family seems to lack them but yours are admirable.", "NTA-nobody has guest rooms in my city.", "NTA. you\u2019re not required to host people. Use your rooms in YOUR HOME for whatever you want.", "NTA. Do whatever you want with your rooms. They can get a hotel when they visit.", "Oh my gosh, you don\u2019t have a ready made spare room that a (pick one) aunt, uncle, nephew, out of town distantly related relative, friend of relative, can crash at for a few days/weeks?", "Figure the difference between a 1 and 2 bedroom unit, ask your family to come up with that amount monthly.  It's your home, use it as you wish. NTA", "As someone who maintains two guest rooms, an extra kitchen, and enough convertible other spaces to comfortably sleep three couples and 6 singles before having to as much as break an inflatable mattress, but who for a long time before that lived in a two bedroom apartment with less than 900 square feet: NTA. Maintaining space for others to contingently occupy is a luxury, not a requirement. It can be nice to be able to host, but not everyone has the means or the personality to have people staying over all the time.", "NTA. enjoy your rec room!", ">My family is insisted on me turning that room into a guest room\n\nThey can have a vote when they start paying rent. \n\nNTA", "NTA I\u2019ve always been guilted into the guest room option and it rarely gets used. You could invest in a pullout couch if that would quiet them down, but follow your bliss.", "Your family is nuts. NTA", "I literally bought a one bedroom home to avoid this kind of manipulation.   Has it worked 100%? No.  Has it worked 85%?  Yes.  NTA.  Stand your ground.  You owe your space to no one.", "Nta Keep the game room. Just tell them you don't plan on overnight guests.", "*you* live there. *you* pay rent. So your vested interest is much greater & you can tell your fam you insist you leave your apartment the way it is \u2728", "One of my neighbors purposely built his home with one bedroom so none of his family would stay with him when they visited.", "Definitely NTA it\u2019s your place to do what you want with. I own a house and don\u2019t have a guest room and wouldn\u2019t have anywhere for family to stay other than the couch.", "Exactly this. NTA. F that noise, keep YOUR plane how YOU want it", "It honestly doesn't make any sense to transform and furnish the other room. She's leasing a two bedroom apartment that she'll probably move out of in a year or two.", "It might make more sense for someone who owns a house but OP is a young person in an apartment. I didn't have the money in my 20s to rent a bigger apartment JUST to have a guest room IN CASE someone came to visit.", "It's not impossible. You can't stay here simply. But you have an extra yeah and?? I pay the bills for me to do as I please. If I don't want to house you I'm not and my family knows this.

They don't even need to step a foot into my house.", "Is that actually emotional manipulation? It's like, if you don't put your hand in the door jam and slam it, you will regret not using a spike as a dildo. Don't know which is one which for the analogy but one of them is getting rid of a room you are paying rent for and the other is hosting family members in a room that you pay rent for and don't really get to use.", "Every time I see a post like this, I remember a long ago frenemy who would do this manipulation, not because she wanted to stay over, but just to make the other person change their mind.", "We\u2019re in our 30s and rent an apartment still (CA housing prices \ud83d\ude2d) and my desk for working remotely once in awhile is also my Xbox playing space, my manicure table, my hardcover book stand, and my art space. \n\nOur 2nd room is our closet because both rooms are only 10x10 and dressers have to fit somewhere, right?!\n\nHaving a guest room in an apartment is a luxury very few can afford.", "Do you have any older relative (who's going to need care) or a younger one who's divorcing/jobless or college age?\n\nETA: because for a night, that guest could use what you have or an air mattress or something. They need that room for something - and you're the only one who doesn't know yet."]}
