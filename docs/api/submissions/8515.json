Not that I think it's that big of a deal to spend thirty seconds walking down an aisle with an enemy...but still, it wasn't unavoidable.", "The AH move by this groomsman was having OPs fiance walk down the aisle with his ex who has tried to break up his current relationship. \n\nNTA but OP you need to think about this relationship. Your fiance is prioritizing his friend over you and you need to look back and think about whether he does this frequently either with the groomsman or with others. I don't think it's reasonable to go from the wedding you're planning to a courthouse wedding if a 3rd party can't be at the wedding; that says the friend is more important to him than you are. \n\nI'm also concerned that neither of you wants to compromise; you're set on the date and it seems fiance could care less but at the same time, he's deciding that if the groomsman can't be there you don't get a wedding beyond the courthouse. I don't think you're compatible or even mature enough for marriage since you each have made decisions not caring what the other wants. You need to be on the same page regarding a wedding and it sounds like you haven't started your planning but each of you has the idea it must be a certain way.\n\nI wonder if your fiance wants a courthouse wedding anyway.", "That\u2019s missing the point.. the point is he chose HIS FREIND over her\u2026. Or their relationship\u2026. Just to accommodate his friendship\u2026 but when the tables are turned and it\u2019s his bff\u2019s wedding which clashes in her birthday\u2026 SHE has the make the sacrifice and step aside to accommodate his friend\u2026 that\u2019s my biggest issue\n\nIf her fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t make it for a legitimate reason it\u2019s then a different issue altogether\u2026", "That\u2019s what ops fianc\u00e9 suggested and she shot that down.", "Same! Our wedding party couldn't afford our date in April, so we signed and had the ceremony in June!", "Isn\u2019t it quite common to do all the paperwork before the actual wedding? I\u2019ve been to several weddings where this is the case. It\u2019s not like the marrying couple are openly announcing this to all of the guests, and even if they did, I don\u2019t think any of the guests would care - the important / fun part is the wedding ceremony / reception anyway.", "Ahhh I get you.  I guess for me we did keep it a secret from most of our wedding guests \ud83d\ude02 but all of our bridal party knew.", "Wow, totally unnecessary dig at service industry workers. Nice!", "Doesn't matter. It's 1-2 days for a wedding, 2 years in advance. Any company refusing this is just garbage.", "There is literally no job where you can't get a few days off with 2 year's notice. What are you on about?", "Are you and fiance both contributing? because the above statement makes it seem like it's all on you. If it's all on you is that because your fiance wants a courthouse wedding anyway?", "If you two love eachother go to a courthouse and get married and throw a wedding later. I get budgets but 4 years is too long if it\u2019s primarily about budget and not something like getting a doctorate or being deployed.\n\nAnyone telling you they can\u2019t get a single day off two years in the future is probably lying or being ridiculous. \n\nI\u2019d sort all of this out with your fianc\u00e9 asap because it seems like maybe you all aren\u2019t the perfect match you think you might be.", "Or just get married then do a vow renewal later.", "I suspect it\u2019s not the employer at all, but rather the groomsman who is being unnecessarily difficult because he doesn\u2019t necessarily want the wedding to happen. Just guessing here but based on OP\u2019s comments.", "When the potential bride picked a date 4 years in advance of the wedding you have to wonder if we're being trolled.", "Not entirely as it turns out, as one can't make it", "I don\u2019t think OP should have any consideration to the friend but to her soon to be husband and what makes him happy", "I very much understand that sentiment. My advice is to move it, but make him do all the work to do so. He might even change his mind.", "No, you would have done it for your husband.  If that is nothing to you, you are making a HUGE mistake in getting married.", "What is making this a YTA situation is that you are prioritizing a date on the calendar over what it is supposed to be about: a celebration of your love with the people you love and care about. I wonder what would happen if the shoe was on the other foot and it was someone important to you that couldn\u2019t make that date. It\u2019s one thing if this were a last minute change, but it\u2019s not. And it involves someone your fianc\u00e9 sees as a best man. I\u2019d be running for the hills if I was marrying someone who prioritizes a date over people.", "So, you prefer your husband resent you for not moving it, so his AH-ish best friend can be there?\n\nESH", "100% this! Decisions are being made unilaterally, and ridiculous ultimatums are being thrown in. I'll honestly be surprised if they make it to their wedding.", "Why does anyone think the fact he got married on her birthday is *a thing*? Wtf do people ask for all guests birthdays in advance lol. Thats some dumb petty shit", "Because rescheduling an entire wedding because it's a +1's birthday is comparable to intentionally cutting out the best man by scheduling in a window you know he can't attend....\n\nThat's a rediculous comparison.", "From the way she said it, he wanted to call off the ceremony as a whole.", "It's probably more common to marry first the last few years, then have a party but no, it's the paperwork that unites them legally so when they go to the courthouse and fill it out, they're married and that is the actual wedding; in European countries the paperwork followed by whatever kidn of wedding they want, if in a church, the church is blessing the marriage as the paperwork is done.\n\nIn the US the wedding first, then paperwork without a stop at the courthouse is typical; they're not having a wedding reception, they're going for the full on spectacle despite being married already. People can call it their \"real wedding\" all they want but if the paperwork is filled out it's a show and they're already married. \n\nIf they're already married, the paperwork has been filled out, the wedding ceremony isn't actually a wedding ceremony it's a vow renewal and the big party is a gift grab. It's dishonest not to tell people you're married and invite them to a vow renewal/reception instead of pretending it's your wedding. It seems there's still a big glut of weddings waiting to happen due to cancellations the last few years and that should be ending soon. For me, that's the only reason to put off the big party but it's deceptive to call it a wedding.\n\nI'm sure this is going to be a different thought than others will have but it's what I think.", "You would be surprised how much people care. They do. I've seen people feel slighted from  not being \"special enough\" to either know or be at that paper signing!", "For most weddings in North America, (I don't know where OP or you're from) the only paperwork that has to be done before a wedding is picking up the licence.  Then at the wedding this gets filled in by the two getting married, the officiant & their witnesses.  If all of the papwerwork is done beforehand, that usually means that they had a courthouse wedding & might be having a religious or symbolic wedding ceremony later.", "It's the groomsman who paired up OPs fiance with the ex that tried to split them apart so I'm going with lying and ridiculous.\n\nIf he's an accountant and the wedding date is in March or April that would make sense but otherwise I can't imagine not being able to get a date off.", "This is what we did, but it's not exactly the same. If you have the time and opportunity to wait, and it doesn't hinder anything like health insurance, might as well wait and have one good party instead.\n\nWe're planning to do a vow renewal, but the attitude we get from family is very much a \"what's the point you're already married\" vibe.", "Sounds great in theory, but I\u2019m still waiting on my renewal of vows after a courthouse wedding almost a decade later\u2026.\n\nProps to OP for all the planning, and NTA.", "I\u2019m broke and need the time to plan it out because I\u2019m paying for it.", "That\u2019s a possibility but I have meant some people who planned that far ahead", "And as I said before they BOTH should it's a two way street", "Either it's not a thing, and then OP getting married when friend can't take a day off is also not s thing.\n\nOr both are a thing.\n\nYou can't have one.", "It\u2019s not the point \u2026 point is he expected her to move THEIR wedding to accommodate his BFF\u2019s job\u2026.\n\nBut her fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t expect his BFF to move his wedding for her birthday and is ok with walking down the isle with his EX\u2026.\n\nThat\u2019s the issue\u2026.", "I'm not even considering the wedding on her birthday that may have been the date that worked best for them or only time the venue was available; the above poster is correct about him choosing his friend over her twice.\n\nFor me the issue is pairing him up in the wedding with his ex who had tried to break up  his relationship with OP. That's a dick move. Surely they could've moved things around so she walked with someone else.", "Exactly, she wasn't even in the wedding. She was a +1.", "Seems like it may be both but I\u2019m guessing there is other stuff at hand here if they need to wait 4 years to get married to save enough money to throw her dream wedding. I\u2019d love to hear the groom or the friend\u2019s take. I\u2019m definitely one of those people who believes large weddings generally make monsters of people and would certainly raise an eye and balk if my wife had said we need to wait four years to get married so she can have a lavish wedding.", "Why are you the only one paying for it?", "Not \"we're\" paying for it?", "Girl what does this guy have to offer even? Emotional support? A pet could do more than that lmao is this really what you want to sign up for *for life*?", "Or maybe it was the couples \"dating anniversary\" and therefore the only possible day they could choose?", "I don't have the impression that it's a lavish wedding; OP said in a comment that she's the only one paying. That's concerning and is probably why fiance jumped right to courthouse wedding; I don't think he wants to get married because he's not willing to help pay for the wedding and jumps to the courthouse wedding probably knowing she doesn't want that.", "So let me get this straight, it's okay for the fiance's groomsman to pick his dating anniversary as his wedding date but OP lacks that discretion?"]}
