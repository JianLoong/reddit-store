You seem to be projecting a lot of gendered division of labor problems onto this family when there\u2019s not an indication of such problems existing in this situation.\n\nOf course she didn\u2019t want to go to her normal tradition when one week post-partum \u2014 so it sounds like OP/Dad took care of the kids the whole day (besides breastfeeding which he literally can\u2019t do and which mom may have wanted to do) so mom could rest on Mother\u2019s Day. Of course she *deserves* a day of fun and going somewhere she likes, which OP said she will do when she wants to have a make-up and he will take care of the kids.\n\nOn Father\u2019s Day, he wants to take his older child to the beach for a couple of hours. If she feels recovered enough to care for the baby, it\u2019s really not an issue to leave a baby\u2026with his mother\u2026for a few hours. If it is a huge issue, OP and his wife could\u2019ve hopefully gotten childcare. \n\nIf they had done something altogether as a family unit instead, it\u2019s likely mom would\u2019ve minded the newborn anyway while dad minded the older kid \u2014 babies that age tend to depend more on mom and cling to her/get upset without her. Babies under 6 months tend to view themselves as an extension of their moms, and feel anxious without her.\n\nNothing about this post suggests OP is dumping the baby on the mom or mom doing unequal or unfair domestic labor. You\u2019re reaching on that. And it sounds like you\u2019re trying to express some righteous anger without cause.", "You're NTA.

Our 3 kids are young adults at this point but we always strived to keep things fair but consider each of their needs individually as well as the needs of the family. We make sure we spent equal time/attention to each of them but that didn\u2019t mean that every time one got attention, the others would in that moment. Examples - I take my son to rock concerts when we can, my youngest daughter to baseball games, my older daughter to dinner. We have a tradition where, in the year they turned 17, my wife and I took each of them individually on a trip somewhere to spend time with them. They got to choose. Our oldest chose California, our son chose a backpacking trip in Colorado. Our youngest will be choosing soon. \n\nIn this case, your youngest child is an infant and it is important to keep traditions with older kids as well.

Your son will start to see his younger sibling as a problem and that'll lead to many issues your wife will have to face later. And if you support your older son during that time, your wife's gonna use that against you via your youngest. So better to clear this up now than suffer in the future.\n\nAnd it's just one year. Why's your wife so uptight about it?", "NTA\n\nWhat would the baby do at the beach? I think OP did the right thing showing that the older child still matters.  There are so many things that change in a family when an infant comes along, the older child can feel left out.  Once the baby is old enough, they can be included in the tradition. Sounds like the mother was looking forward to a child free day and not really concerned with celebrating Fathers Day.", "NTA. I think the baby is about 5 weeks old from your comments. There is no way the baby will notice if you did or didn't take him to the beach. However, you might want to do a little research on music, reading and sign language for babies.

My Dad is an avid fisherman. He'd spend the day fishing and come home for a special family meal and gifts. My Mom is a gardener. She'd be left to spend the day shopping for the garden or being in the garden, and then meal/gifts. Then we might watch a movie picked by the celebrated person, play a board game, or play a game of cards.\n\nCould you not have all gone to breakfast/brunch and then done the beach in the afternoon, or beach in the morning/afternoon and a family supper? If there wasn't enough time to do both, why couldn't you do the beach day Saturday or the following weekend?\n\nBaby might not remember, but your wife will. Spouses are usually the ones to do the leg work for cards, gifts, meals, and such. While it's not \"their day\" they want to celebrate you too.
