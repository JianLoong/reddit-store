As you said the baby won't remember it and you can spend time with him in the evening. But you should bring the baby next year or set a new tradition for you to enjoy with both kids.", "When the baby is older, you need to include them both in most/all things, but I think wanting a day with your older son to enjoy the beach is not a problem. If you did a dinner and both kids were there later, that should be a good compromise. As long as you aren't neglecting your new son in any way, you're NTA.", "NTA. *FINALLY* a dad who doesn't drop their first kids like a bad habit when they have children with another person (on reddit). I think it's fine. The baby won't remember and yall clearly live together so you will spend some time with him that day. Take him with you next year. To me, this isn't a huge deal and your wife is overreacting.", "NTA. It\u2019s actually really important for older children to still get time and attention alone from their parents when new babies arrive. So much will have changed with the baby, including his routines and the necessary focus on the needs of the baby. Without dedicated time with both parents to let him know that he\u2019s still important and loved, he could start to feel abandoned and resent his younger sibling. Maintaining the tradition this year was more important than ever.", "NTA! It's great that you have a special tradition with your son. You can simply create a new tradition with your younger child, or when the time is right include him in the existing one at the beach. There is no need to 'take away' a treasured tradition in order to accommodate a literal infant, who couldn't care less and most certainly is not offended. It's not like you're saying you never intend to spend time with him for father's day.", "NTA- a baby sibling being born takes away a lot of attention from the older child. Since taking care of a newborn is hell. Honestly changing everything in his life around the new baby would be way worse. He has a tradition with his dad and if he lost it because of the new baby resentment would build up. It is a baby. It has no buisness nor need to go out to the beach. Perfectly respectable for you to take your older son out for fatherly bonding", "NTA - Fathers Day is your day - if you wanted to spend it at the beach then go ahead.  The baby will be older next year.", "Even if your baby won\u2019t remember, you will! Do what\u2019s good for you on Father\u2019s Day! NTA", "NTA.

By next year the baby will be old enough to join you.", "NTA. It would be like taking a newborn baby to an amusement park and then being mad at them once they\u2019re older for not remembering it. The baby isn\u2019t going to remember trips with you until roughly after the age of 5. I understand her wanting you to have time with the baby but a few hours taken out of the day just for your older son on Father\u2019s Day to do a tradition that seems to be long standing is not going to kill your relationship with your younger son. \n\nInfo: is your older son from another relationship? Is this a cause of tension with the mother of your youngest child?", "NTA.  This is your tradition and you were within reasonable rights to want to continue it.  Traditions matter.  Your younger son will surely join in on this in time and that will be great.", "NTA. Father\u2019s Day is for the father to do what he wants, not what everyone else wants. Vice Versa for Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s cringey when people think Father\u2019s Day or Mother\u2019s Day is about catering to the children or taking the children out for a treat.

Like, she can still barely walk and is wearing diapers and waking up 6x a night? Or, a few months old, settled into a basic routine? \n\n\nAnd what did she do for mother's day?", "NTA based on this alone, but you would be TA if there is an ongoing trend of you favoring your older child at the expense of your younger child.  Going with just your older son and not the newborn for this year is fine, but in the future your Father\u2019s Day traditions need to include both your children, even if that means modifying them to accommodate the younger one.", "NTA for now...you're right, the baby won't remember this, but they will when they get older...Start planning on changing tradition to include your other child(ren).", "[deleted]", "NAH, this tradition means a lot to you and your son and when your younger son is old enough he will be able to enjoy it too.", "[deleted]", "NAH.

The one who is like a month postpartum. \n\n\nSo...on Mother's Day, did you do everything to help her, and take care of the kids? \n\n\nSo, on Mother's Day, she \"got to do what she wanted\"  (bleed profusely because her vagina was torn open...or recover from a C section), and on Father's Day, you get to go to the beach. \n\n\nPersonally, I think you're right about the importance of this for your older son in terms of his life being shaken up...but you're completely ignoring that your reasoning of \"the younger kid won't remember it anyway,\" means that she's at home taking care of the baby while you're having fun. It's not like the baby can just stay at home while you each go enjoy your day, because the baby \"won't remember being left home alone\". \n\n\nHow about \"Look, I think this tradition is important to older son and I enjoy celebrating it, too.

For about the first four months human babies are potatoes. We\u2019re born earlier than we should be, technically. We should really have more time in womb to develop, but if we did our heads wouldn\u2019t be able to fit the birth canal. That\u2019s why newborns are so gnarly.

She can just feed. The vast majority of people these days don't bat an eyelid at breastfeeding and most of the time you can't see anything anyway as the baby's head is in the way.

Just make sure you bring the little one when you can eventually.", "Why?", "Yeah, I guess it would have been more correct to say \"had another baby.\" I didn't really proofread this.", "Yeah, based on that wording, I assumed this was your first baby with your current wife and that your older son was with another woman.", "I never said it was comparable. You asked me what she did. That's what she did. And she doesn't want to go to the botanical garden right now. She's breastfeeding, and she doesn't want to be stressed about getting home on time for feeding. When she wants to go, she will go. She doesn't need me to offer for her to go. She'll just tell me she's going.", "Everything you have been criticizing him over assumes his wife is the sole caretaker of the baby which from his post and comments isn\u2019t the case. \n\nYour answers make it seem like 1. The mother wanted him to take the child because she wanted a day off, 2. She doesn\u2019t get any days off, which he proved wrong by explaining that she just didn\u2019t want to go out on Mother\u2019s Day and 3. That he won\u2019t help her get some time off with the kids while she goes have fun. \n\nBasically you are blaming him for passing time with his kid, and acting as if he didn\u2019t help at all. You are just jumping to conclusions.", "Who said life was fair? Can\u2019t change the due date, mom got a bad take since she was recovering but that means he has to suffer too just bc she didn\u2019t have a perfect day? Seems you assumed a lot and pre judged without info considering op\u2019s other responses", "Come on now. I think he is NTA but you can't say \" she just didn\u2019t want to go out on Mother\u2019s Day.\" She was literally one week post-partum.", "I absolutely think he's right to spend time with the kid FOR THE KID. But he's basically like \"it's Father's Day, so I should be able to do what I want.\"\n\n\nI didn't say the mother didn't get days off....I'm saying that she's definitely being left alone with the baby during this beach day. \n\n\nAnd the mother didn't WANT TO go out on Mother's Day? Didn't WANT TO???!!!! She was a week post partum....that is not the same!", "I don't see what's so wrong with saying that? She didn't want to go out, because she was one week post partum. Not including the 'because she was one week post partun' part doesn't make 'she didn't want to go out' not true.", "Are you okay? You seem to be projecting a lot of gendered division of labor problems onto this family when there\u2019s not an indication of such problems existing in this situation.\n\nOf course she didn\u2019t want to go to her normal tradition when one week post-partum \u2014 so it sounds like OP/Dad took care of the kids the whole day (besides breastfeeding which he literally can\u2019t do and which mom may have wanted to do) so mom could rest on Mother\u2019s Day. Of course she *deserves* a day of fun and going somewhere she likes, which OP said she will do when she wants to have a make-up and he will take care of the kids.\n\nOn Father\u2019s Day, he wants to take his older child to the beach for a couple of hours. If she feels recovered enough to care for the baby, it\u2019s really not an issue to leave a baby\u2026with his mother\u2026for a few hours. If it is a huge issue, OP and his wife could\u2019ve hopefully gotten childcare. \n\nIf they had done something altogether as a family unit instead, it\u2019s likely mom would\u2019ve minded the newborn anyway while dad minded the older kid \u2014 babies that age tend to depend more on mom and cling to her/get upset without her. Babies under 6 months tend to view themselves as an extension of their moms, and feel anxious without her.\n\nNothing about this post suggests OP is dumping the baby on the mom or mom doing unequal or unfair domestic labor. You\u2019re reaching on that. And it sounds like you\u2019re trying to express some righteous anger without cause."]}
