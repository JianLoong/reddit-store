They also had a 3 year old boy, Barrett.  \n\n\nJosh and I met roughly 2 months after this happened, I was 22 and EXTREMELY naive, Josh was 28. I thought we were just madly in love, but now I think it was probably some kind of trauma bond on Josh's part.  \n\n\nLike I said I was naive and I thought my love would save everything. I had NO clue. Josh asked me to marry him about 3 months after we met, and we married 3 months after that. So I became a stepmother to Josh's children just about 8 months after his wife died. So I had a baby and a 3 and a half year old suddenly.   \n\n\nAlly's whole entire world revolved around Barrett and he was her entire reason for living. This was reflected in many things about Barrett. He has always had an amazing confidence and spirit. Also, he had never, ever heard the word \"no\" before, or ever had to consider anyone else's feelings or needs, like his new sister Emily. He had already had issues with hitting and throwing things at other children and being nasty to them before Ally died. Even though Josh and I both work, he put the bulk of the childcare onto me, and although I had babysat and cared for young relatives, I had NO idea what I was doing. Barrett's behavior and attitude kept only getting worse. He has been in child counseling for over a year now. I have no idea of it's helping because I don't know how much worse things would be without it.   \n\n\nWe have no issues with Emily and I do feel bad for her not only because of how her brother treats her, but we spend so much time dealing with Barrett's behavior that she doesn't get her fair share of attention. And has to grow up in an environment with such unpleasant behavior going on all the time.   \n\n\nI have honestly never loved Barrett, but I sure did try hard to love him, and for a very long time I would have never admitted that I didn't love him.  And I do TELL him I love him. But I honestly feel like it's better for all of us that I stop trying to force myself to love Barrett sincerely. If I'm not trying to force myself to love Barrett, I can take a step back and be objective and really try to do what's best for him in every situation. If I try to force myself to love him, then I'm just upset and feel stomach-sick all the time because of his behavior and how awful it is. Honestly he just behaves as a selfish, zero empathy brat 24-7.  It doesn't seem like normal behavior when I'm around other 5 year olds. I still try to do everything possible for him, to help him and the situation but it's very upsetting in how he treats Emily.", "created_utc": 1688533324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14r0pqf/aita_because_even_though_i_try_to_do_right_by_my/", "score": 225, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But too young to really be able to communicate his feelings and thoughts. Anyone who looses a parent suddenly is going to have a hard time. A child his age its going to be worse.

This is so far above Reddits paygrade. You all need A LOT of therapy. If things aren't getting better with Barrett after a year in counseling, *find a new therapist.* My heart hurts so much for him. There are many respectful parenting accounts on Instagram to follow that may help curb some of his behaviours. Mrchazz, biglittlefeelings, sternasuissa, curious.parenting, themompsychologist, parentingwithintention, drbeckyatgoodinside. \n\nSomething that I try to remember when I'm feeling at the end of my very last nerve, is that \"children who need the most love ask for it in the most unloving ways.\" All behaviour is communication and he is *communicating* to you that he has a need that is not being met. Whether its grief/trauma processing, feeling seen, feeling safe within boundaries, etc. Maybe he's acting this way because he gets a big response and he feels like, even bad attention is attention, so I'm going to keep doing this thing that *always gets a big reaction.* There is something he needs that he is not getting right now. Children become what we tell them they are. If he's hearing that he's bad, or he's a biter, or a hitter, that's the role he's going to play. \n\nI realize that this isn't an answer to the question you actually asked, but it's the answer you (and Barrett and Emily) need. It sucks you're in this situation, but you are. And it *really* sucks for Barrett and Emily.", "YTA, look the kid is/was 3 years old and you and Josh got married 8 months after his mother died. To him it\u2019s like his mother left and never came back and he doesn\u2019t know why and here\u2019s this random woman trying to tell him what to do. It\u2019s good that he\u2019s going through counseling but if he was his mothers whole world coupled with Josh not spending a lot of time watching them, it\u2019s very very likely that Barrett\u2019s mother was his whole world as well and she\u2019s just gone. Some kids can\u2019t process death like adults can, they\u2019ll act how they see fit. If you don\u2019t love him and know you won\u2019t be able to, do yourself and that family a favor and just divorce Josh, it\u2019s not fair that Barrett doesn\u2019t have someone with patience and basically only 1 person loves him in that relationship. What happens when you have a kid? Barrett would be put on the back burner cause \u201che\u2019s not your actual kid\u201d and \u201cyou don\u2019t love him\u201d, that\u2019s extremely selfish if you try and stay in that marriage", "You really dated someone that lost their partner less than two months from when he meet you?", "Lol he\u2019s 5 years old not 25.

You are friggin clueless by your own admission and want to abandon him because he\u2019s acting out. \n\nOf course he\u2019s acting out! HE\u2019S FIVE YEARS OLD AND HIS MOM IS GONE. WTH lady?

This was never a situation you should have put yourself in. That kid needs a lot more than you are able or willing to give and honestly you rushed into a site you are not equipped for.  You do not need to compound the mistake by staying and messing up the kid even more", "YTA. Get a divorce for the sake of Barrett. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be tolerated. He deserves to be loved and you can\u2019t give that to him. Additionally, it doesn\u2019t seem as though you love your husband either. We can\u2019t always control our feelings but we can choose to act honorably. Anything less is abusive!!!!!", "Put him into therapy. He was 3 when he lost his mom. Then was thrust with basically an absentee father and a new baby sister. On top of that, he has a whole new stepmom. He probably sees that Emily is the reason his mom isn\u2019t here anymore even if he doesn\u2019t understand it himself.", "NTA for not loving Barrett right now but Y T A if you don\u2019t try to love him overtime. Personally I think it\u2019s ridiculous how people are crucifying OP for being abusive or a shitty person. Like she said, she was 22 and very naive when she met Josh, I completely believe that she genuinely though her love for him could fix everything and also naturally transfer to the kids. It\u2019s not her fault she was naive enough to not know better. It\u2019s also not her fault that she probably was manipulated into the marriage by Josh to take up a caregiver role that he didn\u2019t want to assume, or that she is struggling with Barrett and doesn\u2019t love him. She did try to love him, and she is also only human after all. I will say, OP you should have more empathy when dealing with Barrett because he\u2019s gone through extremely losses at a young age, but it\u2019s not your fault for being frustrated \u2014 no one can expect you to just automatically love a challenging boy who you barely know, in a living situation where you feel used. But as Josh\u2019s wife now, unless you plan on leaving him which would be a completely different problem to deal with, you do have the responsibility to continue treating Barrett well, not make him feel unloved, and then ultimately learn to genuinely love him over time.", "NTA. Lots of people have no clue what they are talking about. I was a foster parent and then adopted a child who had been through extraordinary abuse and neglect. I have several friends who did the same. It is far, far more difficult than outsiders imagine, and in some cases the best you can do is to try to provide stability and care. Despite the fairy tales, love is not always automatic, and some children truly are much more difficult. But I am here to tell you that if you stick with it, and if your husband is more supportive than he seems to be, you will see bits and pieces of your positive influence over time. And those times get longer and more cohesive. Your son may need therapeutic intervention. Mine sure did. \n\nPlease ignore the haters who have never been there. They presume your husband will magically provide emotional support for these kids if you leave. That\u2019s not at all true. Get some counseling and honestly, your husband needs to step it up. It is his responsibility to provide at least half of the physical and emotional support for these kids.", "NTA. Motherhood is hard even when you don\u2019t have all that trauma and you have the opportunity to do it your way from the start - in those early years, we tend to compare a lot and feel like we\u2019re doing it wrong, others are doing it better/more easily, and that we\u2019re going to mess them up. With kids, as with other family members we didn\u2019t choose to share our lives with (they are given to us), we cannot design a perfect kid to start with. You can love a person without loving their behavior. As with toddlers, parents also need to understand \u201cyou get what you get and you don\u2019t throw a fit.\u201d  In other words, work with the traits and strengths the child has. Set achievable goals and be consistent with the rules - consistency is everything! Studies show a child needs at least one adult (not even always a parent) who loves them unconditionally and they bond with. It can be difficult to bond with a difficult kid but if you keep the faith and keep trying without pressuring yourself or beating yourself up over it, I promise you can build a better relationship. If the behaviors escalate severely as he gets older, seek additional physiatrist evaluation and rule out issues that may require medication or therapy to overcome. Also, I strongly suggest you find a support group and also invest time in educating yourself (at this age with my 2nd I streamed endless episodes of Supernanny to better understand how to adjust my parenting to improve my kids\u2019 behavior. Good luck! You can do it!", "Oof. Blended families are tough. Based solely on this post, your husband is a huge AH. He checked out and has left you to do all of the heavy lifting in terms of childcare and dealing with his kids' trauma as well.\n\nWhile it absolutely is not the child's fault for how he was raised and how his dad basically abandoned him with a stranger the second his mum died, it is horribly unfortunate that he is the one who will be disliked. \n\nBeing a stepparent seems so hard. I think there's so much expectation to love your bonus kid(s) as your own. Sometimes, that's just not possible. \n\nMaybe the bond will grow over time. Maybe it won't. I wonder if he is in therapy? It seems like he's really struggling, and it's tough to take a step back and look at the situation objectively when you're under a constant barrage. \n\nI think your actions show that you care about him and have been trying to do your best by him in a really shitty situation. I think individual therapy for the kids, yourself, and your husband would be worth looking into. And then family/couples therapy. \n\nYou're NTA. You seem to be doing your best in a horrible situation, dealing with trauma from all angles.  Your husband definitely is, though, for inflicting this situation upon you.", "NTA. He's not your child and it's okay that you don't love him. I don't love him either. Even if he was your child, it's very hard to genuinely love someone who's exhibiting such difficult behavior. Lots of parents will admit that. Or they'll say they love them, but don't like them. Or whatever.", "NTA. You don't have to love him as long as you are looking out for him. But it sounds like you don't really like the relationship you're in anyway, so why stick around?", "NTA - OP this is an awful situation you find yourself in and Josh is practically the biggest AH I've encountered on here and that's saying something. You cannot control your feelings and nor should you feel guilty for them, you sound like a good person doing their best for a responsibility which was never yours to being with (I'd really love 5 minutes with Josh to give him some home truths) in extremely trying circumstances. But there is something I'd like you to think about. I think you do love Barrett. You try to do the best for him, you are obviously very concerned about his future and want what's best for him and forgive me for being blunt, you are what, 24, 25? You're still growing, and haven't reached the point yet where you can even understand how complex love can be. Even for children. So don't be so hard on yourself over defining 'love'. Love is more than just the obvious feelings and I think you are doing yourself a disservice. \n\nI've seen your reluctance to consider divorce so I'll ignore that for now, other than to say that you shouldn't sacrifice yourself because of Josh's selfishness. Your dreams and life are every bit as important as everyone else's here and you need to remember that. \n\nYou need more help. Do you have extended family? What about the children's grandparents, can you reach out to them? Including Ally's family (who if in contact with Josh and Ally  I'm guessing weren't too impressed with you and Josh for marrying so quickly). Josh's family too.\n\nIt's good that Barrett is getting counselling, but, from the sounds of it, it's going to take a long time to tackle the trauma that's been caused. (His world was upended and he was only 3, of course, there is trauma, which, unintentionally I'm sure, your quick marriage to Josh will have contributed to) But have you considered speaking to a counsellor too? Someone impartial who can offer perspective and a sounding board would help you I'm sure). \n\nThis is a horrible situation and you do not deserve to be judged on AITA, this is far more complex than that. But I will say again, love is not a simple feeling and I think you'll understand that one day, so for now, stop labelling your emotions and don't feel guilty if you don't feel what you think you should, and just concentrate on doing what you feel is right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He needs at the minimum a CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapist), but he most likely needs a trauma based specialist.  \n\nIf he is 5, he is school age.  Get his school involved in getting you help.  They will say it's behavioral and there is nothing they can do - it's a lie.  You need to educate yourself on what help the school can and should be providing.\n\nBarrett isn't able to regulate his emotions.  He needs help identifying them and learning how to cope with them.

We were doing social emotional books all the damn time, but until a CBT showed me how to use them, it didn't help.  We did so much work to help her center in her body and learn to self regulate.

You do love Emily, he can see that, and it is going to make everything worse.  \n\nLook for a Parent Child Interaction Training program.   Look for a CBT.\n\nIf you have health insurance, call them.  Ask for a navigator or whatever your insurance calls them - they will have someone whose job is to talk you through what benefits you have.  Ask them for help in finding the right kind of professional.\n\nMost therapy at that age is play therapy, and it's not by therapists up to dealing with the level of trauma Barrett is currently experiencing.  As much as you think you are doing your best to give him stability and help, but he is going to be able to tell you favor Emily and between that and losing his mom; it's all trauma.\n\nI can't advise to stay or go, because it sounds like neither is a good choice for him.", "Josh married you because he wanted a nanny who would take the whole responsibility of parenting and probably a bed warmer and you naively thought that was love. \n\nAs for the Barret.

Talk closely with his therapist and watch them like a hawk preferably with Barrett\u2019s dad. \n\nBtw, Barret probably can see you don\u2019t love him and I hope you get a divorce because he deserves better than being the unwanted kid in his own home.\n\nESH", "YTA. Barrett was three years old when he lost his mother, gained a sibling (difficult for a lot of children) and his father opted to remarry. That's a LOT. His father did not act in his best interests and that is the issue here; a year of counselling won't magically erase what this child has been through. \n\nYou're an adult calling a 5 year old child a 'zero empathy brat'. How ironic, given you don't seem to have much, if any, empathy for Barrlett. I don't think it is in Barrett' best interests to have you as a stepparent, harsh as this sounds. You don't seem emotionally ready for it.", "Aw man.   NtA but Barrett is a human being.  He can't possibly understand what's going on.  I have a 5 yr old and a 6 yr old.  This age is very very demanding and kids this age are really low on impulse control.   \nThink about what's going on here.  Barrett lost his mom.  Then his new baby sister stole the spotlight.   He's probably just super super traumatized and unable to verbalize what is going on inside him.  You are also very young and should be commended for your role in helping them along.  \nMaybe while you pretend to love him, love will grow. One of my kids is much more difficult than the other and I think she just really needs attention and specific one on one time.  Maybe you could try just having talks with him and see if he will open up to you.  Find things he likes and show him that you care.  Don't rule out the possibility of love.  Maybe you're a bit overwhelmed at the moment but the fact that you asked the question shows you love him a little.  Do what you can to let the love grow naturally.", "I have had my two stepsons since they were 1 and 3. They are now 12 and 14. I have never loved them, or professed to.

Like, you could help them that way.\n\nIn general, no three-letter acronym 'ruling' fits here, I don't think.

And if I had died in childbirth and my husband married someone who couldn\u2019t love my then two year old son but wanted to claim the baby as basically theirs I would haunt you both from beyond the grave forever.", "NTA but unfortunately 5 year olds being zero empathy brats is incredibly normal. It doesn't mean they don't need to be corrected, just that they aren't secretly evil, either.", "NTA.  I can't believe these comments calling you an asshole. Your husband is the asshole. I understand he went through a trauma, but it sounds like he went out looking for the next available woman who he could plug into the \"mom\" role. Why is the bulk of parenting on you? It sounds like you have done everything you can to help the situation. What is your husband doing? What it his take on Barrett's behavior?", "I also think OP is putting too much pressure on herself to love Barrett as she does Emily. It's easy to bond with a baby, they just want love and easy it up. But Barrett is a child deeply wounded, and he's not going to be easy. \n\nLearn to love Barrett for Barrett, not because he's Josh's son and you should love him. The traits that you call selfish & zero empathy are common with five year olds... They grow into independent, assertive, caring people. You will never love him the same way you do Emily, it's a different relationship, but you might find that you have a deeper love in the long term.\n\nOP scored the awful 3 year old and now hormone surge at 5 (wait until the 10 year old surge fun times). It's a great ride. Honestly both OP and Josh could do with parenting classes and counselling. \n\nSometimes trying to make something work is the worst thing you can do. Sometimes you have to accept that little person is feeling their feels. \n\nThere may be more going on than just trauma with Barrett, but usually it takes time for it to be come clear.\n\n*OP at 22 you knew what you were doing was making a man in a big hurry with 2 very young children. You* WILL *hurt them and cause more trauma if you divorce, at least do everything you humanly can before opening that Pandora's box*", "Here\u2019s the only problem I have with this.  If OP leaves, then Emily is also dealt a bad hand.  It\u2019s not fair to Emily that she loses two mom figures in the first two years, the second \u2018cause of her brother who has taken up so much of her \u201cparents\u201d time already.\n\nMy suggestion?  Barrett needs far more intense therapy and appropriate discipline, and Emily needs all the love she can get.  Do not leave Emily behind.  And make sure you get some help too \u2018cause this is an awful situation all around.\n\nNAH", "Did I miss something? I don't think OP and husband have a kid together. Oh, and she should leave him for sure. She's 24, that's way too young to want to be married forever to a guy who trauma bonded with you and probably needs some time to handle his grief properly and his nightmare child.", "And got engaged with him 5 months in, and married 8 months in... after which she was suddenly responsible for most of the child care.\n\n>Even though Josh and I both work, he put the bulk of the childcare onto me\n\nYikesssss.", "You can't go on with abusing a child (and withholding love IS abuse) just because you are salty that your \"soulmate\" MAY remarry as quick as the did with you and she MAY be like you, unable to love a motherless child. \n\nThe chances are actually super good that she, at least, will love Barret and not treat him like a \"zero empathy brat\" (SURPRISE: children must LEARN empathy FROM THEIR PARENTS, and it happens around age 6).", "At the same time though, it sounds like Josh isn't exactly a shining example of a spouse, especially given these are his kids, and I don't see it being fair that OP should have to stay in a relationship just so that Emily has a stepmother in her life", "You think growing up with a mother figure that loves her and can't stand her brother will be good for Emily in any way or form?", "Yeah, I agree that Emily is in a bad situation as well. That the OP leaving would be potentially hard on her. There really aren't any perfect answers to all this.", "The husband and OP haven't had a biological child. But the younger of the two children has bonded with OP and that child has only had OP as a Mom.", "And legally adopted the kids when they got married.", "You can still get divorced. If you stay you will be TA. This is a great disservice to both the children, and you just stepping back and choosing to not love one of your children is messed up. You were young and naive, and now it\u2019s either the time to look for a lot of counseling and help and put your big girl pants on or admit this is out of your scope and leave. Half assing it doesn\u2019t help anyone.", ">Divorce is not an option because of Emily, she's my child through and through and I will raise her. \n\nIf a stepmother came and treated Precious Emily the way you're treating Barret, will you be OK with that?", "ok, it seems like you\u2019re going in circles, and reddit is not helping. you\u2019ve decided what you\u2019re going to do, you won\u2019t accept any alternatives, ok. that is your choice, and i am not going to judge you. do what you\u2019re going to do, but please seek counselling. you\u2019ve had a hard time, your life is not easy, and i think it could help you in ways neither you nor i can verbalize. if you can get your husband in counselling as well, great. but focus on your own emotional needs before his right now. i hope everything goes well for you, and for the children.", ">I feel like it's best for Emily, and honestly, also for Barrett\n\nIf some stepmother came into Emily's life and treated her like you treat Barret, will you be OK witht hat?\n\nIf not, you KNOW that you're wrong, and causing SO MUCH trauma to Barret. You are basically sacrificing Barret's life and health in the long term in order to be involved with his sister's life. That is bad, and will lead to EXTREMELY bad outcomes for a boy who learned that \"love\" means \"being resentfully tolerated, and that only barely\".", "It\u2019s better than the alternative that people are proposing.", "The only thing I think might help is the husband taking on more responsibility with Barrett and OP doing more with Emily.", "Ikr what a monster!", "You have absolutely no idea how naive somebody can be at that age. It doesn't matter what other people are doing at 22, everybody does things at a different rate. When you are manipulated like this by someone you think you're in love with, and someone in pain, too, it's just too easy to fall into the trap. You don't even realize until you're in too deep.\n\nPlease understand that everyone's experience is different, and we react differently to the things that happen and people in our lives. And be respectful, because these situations can be so sad and toxic and scary.", "Because he is the father. It's his duty. Does it suck for him? Sure. But she has every right to see she was being manipulated and divorce him, his children are mostly his responsibility.", ">Instead of acting like an adult now, she thinks it\u2019s better to just stop giving a 5 year old love. She\u2019s the asshole \n\nAgreed\n\n>so are you for using the \u201chEr BrAiN iSn\u2019T fUlLy DeVeLoPeD\u201d when her actions are causing problems for ACTUAL children.\n\nRight! Especially since her 22 year old brain is (supposedly) more developed than a 5 year old who has lived through three traumatic events. \n\n>Josh is just as much to blame, but why does she get a pass because she was young, dumb, and full of cum, but the man who just experienced severe trauma doesn\u2019t?\n\nEspecially considering that Josh was grieving.  She **wasn't grieving** and at 22 she should be over fairy tales.", "Because 25 is the magic number where logic will prevail and people's choices matter. /s", "28 is six more years of life experience. 22 is fresh out of college, assuming they went the typical 4-year college route.\n\n22 is literally JUST starting you're life after having your responsibilities pretty laid out for you from the time you're super young.\n\nAt 28 you more than likely don't know everything, but you sure as hell (most likely, especially if you are married and have a child) understand and know more than the 22 year old.", "Are you really that dense ... Of course Emily's doing great. She's to young to hold the same trauma but that won't always be the case. What happens when she 8, 10, 12, 14 and she's dealing with the reality that her birth cost her mother her life? If she acts out will you decide that it's in her best interests for you not to love her. \n\nYou are really unbelievable in how you are trying to justify not being able to love a 5 year old highly traumatized little boy but yet still staying in his life and giving his sibling that love.\n\nIf you can't live him then leave. You will only cause him more trauma. You actually seem to blame him for your inability to love a traumatized child you committed to. Just unbelievable.", "you know what? that sounds like love to me. maybe you don't like him. but this shows that you love him. \n\nbut I still think YOU deserve a happy life, maybe with a different man.", ">it's more like not wanting Josh's actions to severely worsen Barrett's trauma and create trauma for Emily when Emily is doing great\n\nChances are, removed from someone who HE KNOWS is pretending to love him and be family, will be BETTER for Barret, which in turn would be BETTER for Emily.\n\n**How do you think adult Barret will ever be able to love ANYONE when the only model for \"love\" he has is you pretending?**", "Hey, I'm sorry people are being so harsh on you. I don't really get it. It sounds like you're doing everything you can in the situation you're in. Is there love between you and your husband? Do you feel like he manipulated you into being a mom? How is he with his kids?", "I mean the husband being more involved would help. But I would also caution against \"Barrett is the husbands responsibility\" while OP gets Emily. It would be an easy answer to the OP's problem, but would just spawn more problems. \n\nBarrett would figure out pretty damn quick that OP just tolerates him to have a relationship with Emily. That dynamic would become even more toxic quickly. \n\nOP you need to get help. You need help for you. You need more help for Barrett and likely need help for Emily.", "Do you even love your husband? If the only person in this fiasco you actually like is Emily why don\u2019t you divorce and split the kids?", "Sounds like he can tell you love his sister more and maybe is taking it out on her. All of you need counseling individually and together.", "So, what I'm hearing is that the way you treat Barrett has ALREADY driven a house-sized wedge between him and his sister, which you seem to encourage.", "Yes. Teaching a little boy that what \"love\" means is a person barely, resentfully tolerating you for the sake of being in your sister's life is, in fact, monstrous.", "They can be naive, but that doesn't mean their brains haven't finished developing yet. It just means they haven't experienced the more difficult aspects of life enough to wear away that naivety", "I agree that\u2019s exactly what she should do. She doesn\u2019t want to do that, instead she wants to give one child love and not the other because she feels that\u2019s okay. She doesn\u2019t get a pass for that just because she was young.", "You conveniently neglected the whole \"most traumatic event the guy will likely ever experience\" part.\n\nAnd just because OP was, not everyone was an incompetent child at 22. \n\nEven at 15 I could have told you that falling head-over-heels for a 2 month widow with 2 kids and then marrying them a couple of month later was a dumbass move.", "At 22, she felt old enough to get married and become a step-parent. She doesn't get a pass because she's \"only 22\" and parenting is hard. OP admitted she knew nothing about children. This **5 year old** lost his primary parent, gained a sister and stepmother, which are all incredibly traumatic, but OP gets a pass because she's 22? Your major focus is on brain development,  so why does the OP's 22 year development cause more empathy in you than a 5 year old child?", "I totally agree with everything you\u2019ve said tbh. That poor boy has experienced so much in his short life. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\nAnd to think she wants to take the daughter and not him. Pfffft", ">Read that over and realize something that vile \\*came out of you.\\* You shouldn't be let within 100 feet of a child, much less giving \"advice\" about them on the internet.\n\nProjection.\n\nYOU are the one who called **a 5 year old child who doesn't know what the word \"love\" means** a \"zero empathy brat\".", "You are judgemental as hell", "Right back at ya!", ">While it is very sad the situation with your student ,op isn't ignoring Barrett , she is thinking of him and how to help him in the long run despite right now not being able to love him.\n\nShe's literally teaching him that the only \"love\" he can ever know, what love MEANS, is someone pretending to tolerate him for the sake of her marriage, and resenting even that."]}
