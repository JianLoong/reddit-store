Maybe it's a way in for him to learn what hurts your feelings though.", "NTA and the fact he's blaming you for having a reaction to a jerk comment instead of apologizing and trying to shift blame is a major red flag to me. He embarrassed himself, you're not responsible if he was given crap because he said something unkind.", "NTA - yikes, that sucks and is honestly weird how there\u2019s some sort of hierarchy of asian languages to him, as though your language, and heritage as implied, is worth less than others to him. Like, is he going to jump ship on your relationship when the first Korean or Japanese girl shows interest in him, since he seemingly values their cultures more? Sorry you experienced this, it was insensitive at very least and definitely concerning\u2026", "NTA. My first thought was that sometimes our explanations for things don\u2019t come out right.

However, if that were the case, you\u2019d expect him to be leaving you messages like \u2018I\u2019m so sorry for what I said, i didn\u2019t mean it the way it came out, can we talk about this?

It depends a lot on your native language, your ear, what languages you've been exposed to and who was speaking. My friend speaking European Portuguese sounds much sweeter than some random guy yelling in the same language.\n\nIf bf watches anime or listens to K-pop, it's going to sound 'better' just cause exposure, not because it's actually better. It's not racist to prefer some sounds, but it's downright stupid and insulting to say that to you and in that context. Honestly, I would have taken it in stride and would have just insulted his native language back, but I'm older and an AH.\n\nHe should have known better. If he's usually considerate, give him a chance to apologise.

It\u2019s nothing personal. Especially since he shown interest in your culture. I think it\u2019s totally ok to break up with someone that constantly makes fun of something that is dear to you, seeing that upsets you. I certainly done it more than once. But this is just one comment. And objectively people do categorize many languages that way - i guess i just laugh it off when someone says something like that; because for me its not true, but they are allowed to have that opinion.\n\nI will say NAH, because I dont have a heart to call you TA.", "NTA, the joke would've been fine if it stopped at \"it sounded too rough and weird for him\" but mentioning that other languages would be fine is quite rude.

Hopefully you'll work it out.", "**YTA**\n\nI wouldn't be offended if someone called English, my native language, rough and weird -- it most definitely is a rough and weird language. Many languages are rough with weird noises and pronunciations and there's nothing wrong with someone having an opinion on this.\n\nI love how Russian, German, Japanese, and Korean sound for a small example but throatier languages with short/quick syllables like Thai, Tagalog, etc just don't hit right to me -- and that's okay.\n\nIt's one thing to be protective of your homeland, but the topic at hand is a language. Words. A dictionary. You definitely took it way too far.", "YTA. In my opinion that was not an insult that you should be taking personal (and honestly that direct communication is typical from Europeans, so get used to it). It is the way he perceives your language and he is also entitled to have impressions, feelings and emotions about the new world you are exposing him to. But it's not the way he perceives you.", "Very, very soft YTA.\n\nSome languages do sound harsh to native English speaking ears.\n\nAnd I say this as mixed race Brit with a German husband who studied Mandarin to HSK 5.\n\nI don't think you embarrassed him in public however, but he wasn't slagging off your homeland or who you are. It was just sounds.", "NTA at all.

I can't say you are T A, but I do agree you overacted. \n\nSimply explain to your boyfriend that his comments felt like he was insulting your native language, and that was upsetting to you. Once you explain how you feel, if he is a kind person, he will be more careful with his comments going forward.\n\nStorming off and then refusing to talk to your partner when they have said something that upsets you is NOT the way to have a successful relationship.", "NAH.\n\nDrunk guys say stupid shit. It is what it is and he should apologise to you. He's trying to get ahold of you to talk about it, and you are pushing him away while questioning the entire relationship over one statement.\n\nGive him a chance to make up for it.\n\nOne time my gf told me to my face that she's embarrassed to be around me sometimes because of my skin color. I cried. A lot. We worked it out and have been happier than ever.\n\nAt the very least, you should text him back and tell him you need time and space, rather than ghosting him. He cares about you. Once you've cooled off, I'm sure you can have a productive conversation about how you feel. He will realize he was wrong for what he said, and you'll both be closer afterwards.", "NTA\n\nAre you willing to give up on him because of this?  If you are then tell him.  If you are willing to let it go, then also tell him.  Communication is so much more important than stonewalling.  Just don't do that please.  He may be thick enough that he has no idea how rude he sounded.", "NAH. He was a bit gruff and you were a bit sensitive, but I view this as a potentially minor ripple if there were drinks involved. I'm actually more curious as to what Asian language sounds \"rough,\" as most European languages sound that way in comparison to my ear.", "So instead of saying \u201coh man that came out badly, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d he made it your fault for having genuine emotions?\n\nNTA", "Why are you still dating a racist?? NTA get some self respect", "YTA from my POV because it seems like an overreaction. \n\nDifferent cultures have a different perception regarding languages, traditions, etc. The coverage the language and or culture has in media also has a huge impact in the way it is perceived. For your average person that has a shallow understanding of Japanese language, for example, it may sound dramatic or it may sound weird. Those are things that are subject to change and the person in OP's story was not racist or discriminatory in any way.", "NTA. You didn't embarrass him, he embarrassed himself.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s not owning the fact that what he said was racist or at least insulting and negative. He insulted your language and basically said it was too \u201cweird\u201d to learn? Gross. \n\nThe comments here saying he just made an observation are missing some key context. \n\nSaying a language sounds rough compared to other languages is an *observation*. Fine! \nSaying it\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d is a *negative judgement*.\nNot fine! \n\nFor me it\u2019s his choice to not try to understand or reflect. He was insulting- the words he chose were distinctly negative. Why not say, hey, I see how that would have sounded and I\u2019m sorry? It\u2019s the doubling down that makes him an AH", "NTA He thinks her language is rough and weird, why should she continue speaking to him in his language? English is a  fucking awful hodge podge language. English doesn't follow many of the rules that it sets up for itself.

If the comment wasn't weird enough, the blame shifting on top of that is definitely a turnoff", "I'll got against the majority and say NAH (maybe).\n\nYes it's completely understandable that you felt hurt, it's your language, your culture.\n\nBut I don't think he was necessarily an asshole for the joke. Yes some language sound more rough than other, and yes some language are so different from our own that it sound weirder than other.\n\nThere is also contact, some language have a bigger cultural reach around the world. Korean have stuff like BTS, Gangnam style, Squidgame, Korean drama. Japanese have any anime and manga. Western culture is just more used to contact with those language and obviously it will feel more natural for them, less distant.\n\nGerman language is not distant from the rest of European, but the language being seen as rough, complicated and weird is a pretty regular thing.
