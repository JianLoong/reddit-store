Maybe it's a way in for him to learn what hurts your feelings though.", "NTA and the fact he's blaming you for having a reaction to a jerk comment instead of apologizing and trying to shift blame is a major red flag to me. He embarrassed himself, you're not responsible if he was given crap because he said something unkind.", "NTA - yikes, that sucks and is honestly weird how there\u2019s some sort of hierarchy of asian languages to him, as though your language, and heritage as implied, is worth less than others to him. Like, is he going to jump ship on your relationship when the first Korean or Japanese girl shows interest in him, since he seemingly values their cultures more? Sorry you experienced this, it was insensitive at very least and definitely concerning\u2026", "NTA. My first thought was that sometimes our explanations for things don\u2019t come out right.

However, if that were the case, you\u2019d expect him to be leaving you messages like \u2018I\u2019m so sorry for what I said, i didn\u2019t mean it the way it came out, can we talk about this?

It depends a lot on your native language, your ear, what languages you've been exposed to and who was speaking. My friend speaking European Portuguese sounds much sweeter than some random guy yelling in the same language.\n\nIf bf watches anime or listens to K-pop, it's going to sound 'better' just cause exposure, not because it's actually better. It's not racist to prefer some sounds, but it's downright stupid and insulting to say that to you and in that context. Honestly, I would have taken it in stride and would have just insulted his native language back, but I'm older and an AH.\n\nHe should have known better. If he's usually considerate, give him a chance to apologise.

I think it\u2019s totally ok to break up with someone that constantly makes fun of something that is dear to you, seeing that upsets you. I certainly done it more than once. But this is just one comment.

Hopefully you'll work it out.", "**YTA**\n\nI wouldn't be offended if someone called English, my native language, rough and weird -- it most definitely is a rough and weird language. Many languages are rough with weird noises and pronunciations and there's nothing wrong with someone having an opinion on this.\n\nI love how Russian, German, Japanese, and Korean sound for a small example but throatier languages with short/quick syllables like Thai, Tagalog, etc just don't hit right to me -- and that's okay.\n\nIt's one thing to be protective of your homeland, but the topic at hand is a language. Words. A dictionary. You definitely took it way too far.", "YTA. In my opinion that was not an insult that you should be taking personal (and honestly that direct communication is typical from Europeans, so get used to it). It is the way he perceives your language and he is also entitled to have impressions, feelings and emotions about the new world you are exposing him to. But it's not the way he perceives you.", "Very, very soft YTA.\n\nSome languages do sound harsh to native English speaking ears.\n\nAnd I say this as mixed race Brit with a German husband who studied Mandarin to HSK 5.\n\nI don't think you embarrassed him in public however, but he wasn't slagging off your homeland or who you are. It was just sounds.", "NTA at all.

I can't say you are T A, but I do agree you overacted. \n\nSimply explain to your boyfriend that his comments felt like he was insulting your native language, and that was upsetting to you.

It is what it is and he should apologise to you. He's trying to get ahold of you to talk about it, and you are pushing him away while questioning the entire relationship over one statement.\n\nGive him a chance to make up for it.\n\nOne time my gf told me to my face that she's embarrassed to be around me sometimes because of my skin color. I cried. A lot. We worked it out and have been happier than ever.\n\nAt the very least, you should text him back and tell him you need time and space, rather than ghosting him. He cares about you. Once you've cooled off, I'm sure you can have a productive conversation about how you feel. He will realize he was wrong for what he said, and you'll both be closer afterwards.", "NTA\n\nAre you willing to give up on him because of this?  If you are then tell him.  If you are willing to let it go, then also tell him.  Communication is so much more important than stonewalling.  Just don't do that please.  He may be thick enough that he has no idea how rude he sounded.", "NAH. He was a bit gruff and you were a bit sensitive, but I view this as a potentially minor ripple if there were drinks involved. I'm actually more curious as to what Asian language sounds \"rough,\" as most European languages sound that way in comparison to my ear.", "So instead of saying \u201coh man that came out badly, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d he made it your fault for having genuine emotions?\n\nNTA", "Why are you still dating a racist??

For your average person that has a shallow understanding of Japanese language, for example, it may sound dramatic or it may sound weird. Those are things that are subject to change and the person in OP's story was not racist or discriminatory in any way.", "NTA. You didn't embarrass him, he embarrassed himself.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s not owning the fact that what he said was racist or at least insulting and negative. He insulted your language and basically said it was too \u201cweird\u201d to learn? Gross. \n\nThe comments here saying he just made an observation are missing some key context. \n\nSaying a language sounds rough compared to other languages is an *observation*. Fine! \nSaying it\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d is a *negative judgement*.\nNot fine! \n\nFor me it\u2019s his choice to not try to understand or reflect. He was insulting- the words he chose were distinctly negative. Why not say, hey, I see how that would have sounded and I\u2019m sorry? It\u2019s the doubling down that makes him an AH", "NTA He thinks her language is rough and weird, why should she continue speaking to him in his language? English is a  fucking awful hodge podge language. English doesn't follow many of the rules that it sets up for itself.

If the comment wasn't weird enough, the blame shifting on top of that is definitely a turnoff", "I'll got against the majority and say NAH (maybe).\n\nYes it's completely understandable that you felt hurt, it's your language, your culture.\n\nBut I don't think he was necessarily an asshole for the joke. Yes some language sound more rough than other, and yes some language are so different from our own that it sound weirder than other.\n\nThere is also contact, some language have a bigger cultural reach around the world. Korean have stuff like BTS, Gangnam style, Squidgame, Korean drama. Japanese have any anime and manga. Western culture is just more used to contact with those language and obviously it will feel more natural for them, less distant.\n\nGerman language is not distant from the rest of European, but the language being seen as rough, complicated and weird is a pretty regular thing.

Really got me thinking about parts of language that I didn\u2019t even know existed!", "You are my hero for today! Thank you! Trying to gaslight you into thinking it\u2019s not gaslighting \ud83d\ude44", ">He didn't say he would rather have a girlfriend of a different culture\n\nI think this is true, and as someone whose native language is also considered \"rough\" (I totally get it, we always sound like we're angry), this isn't where my mind would go either. I've been trying to learn other languages lately too, and I can definitely say that there are some that are just far more easier, while others are \"weirder\" in terms of actually learning them.\n\nHowever, I can see where the bf's statements can be insulting, and where comparing it to other languages can make it worse. Again, I do speak a native language that often got reactions that weren't exactly pleasant, so I can empathize with the gf a lot too. There's also various instances in history wherein language has been used to insinuate a \"barbarism\" within groups of people, and it's unfortunately not an uncommon thing for people to be insulting to your culture through your language. So even though I wholeheartedly believe that the bf didn't mean to attack her culture, I can also empathize why OP would feel insulted by his remarks. Language IS an inextricable part of culture after all, so conversations like this can go sideways quite quick if we aren't careful.\n\nJust to make it very clear, this all isn't to say that the bf is just a racist asshole. I can see how someone can describe my language the way he did without meaning anything else by it. In the end, we don't know what can be hurtful to people, and to me, the bf only became an asshole later when he seems to just be pissed at her instead of actually apologizing for saying something that ended up being hurtful. I wouldn't say he was an asshole before that.", "Chicken too, it\u2019s pretty special.", "Sorry to be pedantic, but language discussions tempt me too much. You\u2019re mostly right, except that the languages that contain click consonants (as far as I can remember right now) generally have multiple click phonemes. However it\u2019d be cool if there is a language that basically views [+click] as a value undifferentiated by place of articulation so that any click consonant wouldn\u2019t alter the meaning of a word. There probably would be \u201ctypical\u201d pronunciations based on phonological environment, but no minimal pairs distinguishing words. I\u2019m getting into the weeds of the weeds though. Sorry you were the target of my unnecessary correction.", "I am from the U.K. and live abroad , I can always tell a German even without the action because they make the sentence waaaaay more complicated than it needs to be because they aren\u2019t used to the simplicity of English grammar (not a bad thing just a thing)", "Same. My kid has German at school. She asks me (native German) often to explain the gender of a noun. How can I? It's (seemingly) random as fuck. I don't really see why a chair would be considered male but a bench female. Or a closet male but a shelf is neutrum. I told my daughter she'll just have to learn that by heart.", "I love this!!!", "Shit like this is why people can't spell.", "I love that!!", "Not just eastern xD I've worked for an American company (while in Portugal) and the leadership would complain that we complained too much and we didn't know how to just be quiet when we didn't like something and were too blunt xD\n\nWe usually say we have our heart in our throat, as in we just speak what we feel :D", "Almost like every language is both similar to and unique from other languages. But it can feel cool to people to believe that *they* speak an especially different, unique, or difficult language.", "The word 'barbarian' exists because to the Ancient Greeks, when foreigners talked, it sounded like 'bar bar' to them", "I don't agree with this. Unfamiliarity should result in intrigue not dissing it for not sounding like what they consider to be a 'better' language. Especially when the languages that they considered to be much more \"pleasing\" are the ones that are constantly fetishized.", "Umm No. As a South African who speaks Xhosa, English doesn't sound \"weird\" at all because we are quite familiar with it. We speak it fluently as a 2nd language. There is literally no reason to label another language as weird just because *you* don't speak it or don't understand that universal speech doesn't revolve around English", "If he just said 'it's weird' - which is a shit thing to say to anyone about their language, frankly, then I could potentially see this point. However, as he said \"if it was Japanese or Korean, then he would try\" makes this attempt to be innocuous void. \n\nThere is alot of tension between the East Asia and South East Asia and South Asia regarding the difference in treatment i.e the glorification of East Asian culture and languages vs. The write off on SEA/SA culture - and often people will refer to SEA languages as \"rough\" or \"loud\" or \"uncultured\".\n\nAs someone who is SEA, if my partner said my language was weird and rough I would definitely be raising my eyebrows and maybe I would plead for his ignorance, but even if, we say it is not racist, it shows that he believes there is an heirachy that exists within Asian languages. And even if that's reaching, he is simply rude, and saying something like that about someone's language shows he lacks both culture and grace.", "But clearly **he** meant weird-bad because he was using it to justify his refusal to learn it.  I don't know how we could get \"fascinating\" from \"Nawww man, I ain't learning that shit.  It's too weird.\"", "Not necessarily \u201cracist\u201d but a bit xenophobic, don\u2019t you think?\nImagine your SO is German and you tell them you don\u2019t want to learn their language (that is very much part of their culture) because it\u2019s weird and ugly and \u201cwere they Italian, it would be different of course\u201d. I can\u2019t see that going well", "Still: German has so many rules\u2026 spoken language often is quite legere but if you want to follow the rules how they are supposed to be used\u2026 that\u2019s another story. \n\nBut I absolutely agree: every language has its own challenges (what\u2019s making it fun to learn a new one ^^ )", "Came to find this comment. Thank you.", "I feel like Korean and Japanese are phonetic enough for people to grasp easier instead of tonal languages like mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese or Thai.", "That's pretty much what \"weird\" is though, something that is unfamiliar. Like you say, you only don't call English weird because you've grown up around it. We haven't grown up around Xhosa.   \n\n\nI think Xhosa is fascinating, but I'm not going to pretend it doesn't sound weird to me. If you think that is racist, all I can say is I don't understand.", "Lol you literally just made their point. \"English doesn't sound weird because we're quite familiar with it.\"\n\nSensitive redditors. Shit, I only speak English and I think people speaking English sound weird if they have a thick accent like Boston, Chicago, deep south, Appalachia. Stop acting like everything is a personal insult.", "I don\u2019t necessarily think so, I\u2019d want to hear a more complete explanation.  There are some languages I would never be capable of learning because it requires sounds I can\u2019t seem to make or the ability to hear distinctions in tone that I just\u2026cannot.   A person might describe a language as being \u201crough\u201d when they are really referring to some of those more guttural sounds.  I don\u2019t have any prejudice towards people who speak these languages.", "Not true.  One of my husband's best friends is German and we both think the language is harsh.  But, because we care for him so much the sound of it being spoken by any German is endering to us both.", "No it wouldn't. I'm learning german and enjoying it. It still sounds rough.\n\nIt has nothing to do with the opinion on Germans.\n\nMy partner once was on tour (can't remember the country, sorry, but it was in Europe) in which the tour guide (who was a local) said their language was the language of hell because of how rough and weird it sounded and how difficult it was. Is he racist towards his own language?", "What a load of presumptuous shite", ">It's would certainly imply that you find common german sounds rough\n\nFixed that for you.", "No it wouldn't. Thinking a language sounds weird doesn't imply I'm anti the people who speak that language.\n\nTagalog is, to me, a weird-sounding language but Filipinos are some of the nicest, most generous people I've ever met.", "huh? honestly why are you bringing race into this?", "Clicking as a langue is weird to any speaker who has words in their native tongue, even other black people", "I think there's even a pyramid model used for languages. Some languages +English being one of those) us a pyramid upside down: learning basics is pretty easy but it takes more and more effort to actually master it \n\nSome languages are the opposite: the start is tricky because you can't use your own language for reference and the vocabulary is completely different from what you already know. Finnish would be an example of this. Good news is once you grasped fundamentals it gets easier to master it.", "Some won't get your viewpoint because it is counter to their position. Some people, think they are doing the person a favor just by being with them. Letting them into their orbit is a gift. But, these people are subtle racists as they believe they are \"saving\" them from their cultures or their race. It is very sad and disheartening.\n\nAfter many years you can pick them out as soon as they open their mouths.", "I _KNEW_ it felt lowkey fetishizing when he specifically mentioned Japanese and Korean", "And if the context around the comments were different it would be fine. \n\nMy comment is not that no one can like Japanese more than Vietnamese as a culture or language. The point is that there is a lot of baggage with comparing Japan and Korea to other Asian countries and cultures. It is understandable for OP to not take the comments well given that context and baggage and the boyfriend is not behaving well with her showing mild upset. The boyfriend also has no hint of knowledge of linguistics.", "\"Oh, man. I am way too bad at languages to learn (language).\"\n\n\"No, I don't have the ear for it.\"\n\n\"I hadn't planned on it.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThere's polite ways to say no, I'm not learning that language.\n\n\"It's rough and weird,\" is just showing a serious lack of cultural relativism and serious presence of ethnocentrism.", "Agreed, and also probably be like \"that's weird, I need to know more\" :)", "Telling a dude that the language he's speaking sounds weird and rough doesn't imply any negative feelings? Seriously? I get that context matters but... come on man."]}
