That was pretty obnoxious of him. He probably thought he was teasing you and didn't mean anything by it, but that's not an excuse. And it's still not cool. Maybe it's a way in for him to learn what hurts your feelings though.", "NTA and the fact he's blaming you for having a reaction to a jerk comment instead of apologizing and trying to shift blame is a major red flag to me. He embarrassed himself, you're not responsible if he was given crap because he said something unkind.", "NTA - yikes, that sucks and is honestly weird how there\u2019s some sort of hierarchy of asian languages to him, as though your language, and heritage as implied, is worth less than others to him. Like, is he going to jump ship on your relationship when the first Korean or Japanese girl shows interest in him, since he seemingly values their cultures more? Sorry you experienced this, it was insensitive at very least and definitely concerning\u2026", "NTA. My first thought was that sometimes our explanations for things don\u2019t come out right. What he said was clearly hurtful to you, but could have simply been a misunderstanding. However, if that were the case, you\u2019d expect him to be leaving you messages like \u2018I\u2019m so sorry for what I said, i didn\u2019t mean it the way it came out, can we talk about this? Are you ok?\u2019 But no that\u2019s not what you got. He\u2019s the AH.", "NTA\n\n\nThat was a real ahole thing to say. Also a werid look to the future. Like \"I wont ever try to speak even a few words of your language\".", "NTA. that isn\u2019t a joke, it\u2019s just rude.", "NTA\n\nThat was a stupid thing to say, but it's true that to various speakers some languages sound harsher and some sound more melodious. It depends a lot on your native language, your ear, what languages you've been exposed to and who was speaking. My friend speaking European Portuguese sounds much sweeter than some random guy yelling in the same language.\n\nIf bf watches anime or listens to K-pop, it's going to sound 'better' just cause exposure, not because it's actually better. It's not racist to prefer some sounds, but it's downright stupid and insulting to say that to you and in that context. Honestly, I would have taken it in stride and would have just insulted his native language back, but I'm older and an AH.\n\nHe should have known better. If he's usually considerate, give him a chance to apologise. If he just insists _you_ made him look bad, then he's a double AH, cause he made himself look bad.\n\n**Source**: my native language sounds just fine to me but I've heard non-native speakers say it sounds like we're angry all the time.", "NTA doesn't sound like a joke but an asshole being an asshole", "NTA. My ex was from Vietnam and it was actually quite the bonding experience for me to learn her language (try to at least!). \n\nA good partner would want to learn, especially if they wanted a long term future with you. I understand some of the tonal languages are frankly very difficult for some people to learn but to joke about it sounding too weird or rough, well that's really rude to be frank.", "NAH. I am from the Balkans and I can\u2019t count how many times people told me my language sounds rough. Like I am fighting all the time. I talk to my mom and my bf asked me \u2018why did you fight, what happened\u2019? Or \u2018oh no, did something bad happen?\u2019. I am like we didn\u2019t fight, I literally told her I love her lol. But that\u2019s just how it sounds to people, I see it as normal?", "NTA: He does not respect you. Point blank, he cares only for his embarrassment?!!? GTFO with that nonsense and find you someone who respects you for all of you and who you are. They don't have to learn your language but she sure as hell must respect it.", "NTA. We all tell jokes that push a boundary. The fact that he saw that it hurt you, and then doubled down and said you\u2019re embarrassing him is the real issue you need to address. That\u2019s real immaturity.", "My native language isnt English and if i am honest i don\u2019t understand why would anyone be upset about comments of your bf. I wouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s nothing personal. Especially since he shown interest in your culture. I think it\u2019s totally ok to break up with someone that constantly makes fun of something that is dear to you, seeing that upsets you. I certainly done it more than once. But this is just one comment. And objectively people do categorize many languages that way - i guess i just laugh it off when someone says something like that; because for me its not true, but they are allowed to have that opinion.\n\nI will say NAH, because I dont have a heart to call you TA.", "NTA, the joke would've been fine if it stopped at \"it sounded too rough and weird for him\" but mentioning that other languages would be fine is quite rude. You were fine to leave, but I would suggest talking it out with him and explaining why it hurt you when he said that. Hopefully you'll work it out.", "**YTA**\n\nI wouldn't be offended if someone called English, my native language, rough and weird -- it most definitely is a rough and weird language. Many languages are rough with weird noises and pronunciations and there's nothing wrong with someone having an opinion on this.\n\nI love how Russian, German, Japanese, and Korean sound for a small example but throatier languages with short/quick syllables like Thai, Tagalog, etc just don't hit right to me -- and that's okay.\n\nIt's one thing to be protective of your homeland, but the topic at hand is a language. Words. A dictionary. You definitely took it way too far.", "YTA. In my opinion that was not an insult that you should be taking personal (and honestly that direct communication is typical from Europeans, so get used to it). It is the way he perceives your language and he is also entitled to have impressions, feelings and emotions about the new world you are exposing him to. But it's not the way he perceives you.", "Very, very soft YTA.\n\nSome languages do sound harsh to native English speaking ears.\n\nAnd I say this as mixed race Brit with a German husband who studied Mandarin to HSK 5.\n\nI don't think you embarrassed him in public however, but he wasn't slagging off your homeland or who you are. It was just sounds.", "NTA at all. You should have just let him know he is too stupid to learn Mandarin, Japanese or Korean, but you thought he at least had the ability to learn some respect.\n\nDitch him, no good.", "NAH. I can't say you are T A, but I do agree you overacted. \n\nSimply explain to your boyfriend that his comments felt like he was insulting your native language, and that was upsetting to you. Once you explain how you feel, if he is a kind person, he will be more careful with his comments going forward.\n\nStorming off and then refusing to talk to your partner when they have said something that upsets you is NOT the way to have a successful relationship.", "NAH.\n\nDrunk guys say stupid shit. It is what it is and he should apologise to you. He's trying to get ahold of you to talk about it, and you are pushing him away while questioning the entire relationship over one statement.\n\nGive him a chance to make up for it.\n\nOne time my gf told me to my face that she's embarrassed to be around me sometimes because of my skin color. I cried. A lot. We worked it out and have been happier than ever.\n\nAt the very least, you should text him back and tell him you need time and space, rather than ghosting him. He cares about you. Once you've cooled off, I'm sure you can have a productive conversation about how you feel. He will realize he was wrong for what he said, and you'll both be closer afterwards.", "NTA\n\nAre you willing to give up on him because of this?  If you are then tell him.  If you are willing to let it go, then also tell him.  Communication is so much more important than stonewalling.  Just don't do that please.  He may be thick enough that he has no idea how rude he sounded.", "NAH. He was a bit gruff and you were a bit sensitive, but I view this as a potentially minor ripple if there were drinks involved. I'm actually more curious as to what Asian language sounds \"rough,\" as most European languages sound that way in comparison to my ear.", "So instead of saying \u201coh man that came out badly, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d he made it your fault for having genuine emotions?\n\nNTA", "Why are you still dating a racist?? NTA get some self respect", "YTA from my POV because it seems like an overreaction. \n\nDifferent cultures have a different perception regarding languages, traditions, etc. The coverage the language and or culture has in media also has a huge impact in the way it is perceived. For your average person that has a shallow understanding of Japanese language, for example, it may sound dramatic or it may sound weird. Those are things that are subject to change and the person in OP's story was not racist or discriminatory in any way.", "NTA. You didn't embarrass him, he embarrassed himself.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s not owning the fact that what he said was racist or at least insulting and negative. He insulted your language and basically said it was too \u201cweird\u201d to learn? Gross. \n\nThe comments here saying he just made an observation are missing some key context. \n\nSaying a language sounds rough compared to other languages is an *observation*. Saying it\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d is a *negative judgement*.\n\nFor me it\u2019s his choice to not try to understand or reflect. He was insulting- the words he chose were distinctly negative. Why not say, hey, I see how that would have sounded and I\u2019m sorry? It\u2019s the doubling down that makes him an AH", "NTA He thinks her language is rough and weird, why should she continue speaking to him in his language? English is a  fucking awful hodge podge language. English doesn't follow many of the rules that it sets up for itself. Remember I before E except after c, or when it says ei like in neighbor and weigh. Look closer at the language and you will find more words in English break that rule instead of follow it. TAKE IT AWAY GALLAGHER\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ObkJNstaog8?si=QojBGh4oC_PUR59F", "NTA!!! If the comment wasn't weird enough, the blame shifting on top of that is definitely a turnoff", "I'll got against the majority and say NAH (maybe).\n\nYes it's completely understandable that you felt hurt, it's your language, your culture.\n\nBut I don't think he was necessarily an asshole for the joke. Yes some language sound more rough than other, and yes some language are so different from our own that it sound weirder than other.\n\nThere is also contact, some language have a bigger cultural reach around the world. Korean have stuff like BTS, Gangnam style, Squidgame, Korean drama. Japanese have any anime and manga. Western culture is just more used to contact with those language and obviously it will feel more natural for them, less distant.\n\nGerman language is not distant from the rest of European, but the language being seen as rough, complicated and weird is a pretty regular thing. Yes I'm looking at you delegation transfer law for cattle and beef labeling supervision duties or\n\nRinderkennzeichnungsfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz\n\nWith that said, it's also possible that your boyfriend is just an insensitive jerk that don't care about making fun or other culture. I just don't think that calling a language weird or rough is necessarily making fun of another culture. Most language are weird with plenty of exception, non arbitrary rules and stuff that make no sense.

To be offended over a language is ridiculous. Do you think I'd take it to heart if someone called English, my native language, rough and weird? Fuck no lol", ">He didn\u2019t share a preference.\n\nThat's *literally* what he did.\n\n>He insulted the language \n\nNo, insulting the language would be \"It's a shit language that doesn't deserve to exist\".\n\nWhat he did is share his subjective feelings about the language, which he is perfectly entitled to have and which were relevant to the conversation - that is different from making a scornful remark.", ">Some languages are weird, linguistically.\n\n\nThing is, this is subjective. \n\nNo one will feel good speaking your own language while you call theirs \"weird\".\n\nMake an effort or listen to their concern is my perspective.", "I did read your whole comment. Do you understand the implications of what you wrote?\n\nBecause it reads like an apology for her racist BF.", "> I didn't say it was a free pass.\n\nYes you did, as that was the reason for you judging him not to be an asshole.", "But then why isn\u2019t he an AH for refusing to apologize", "You don\u2019t get to decide how someone should feel about the negative connotations of \u2018TOO rough and weird\u2019, it clearly upset her. He then went on to say if it was like another language (rude) he would have tried to learn. \n\nYes, they need to talk. But how can you justify calling her an AH for being offended by his thoughtless remarks?\nHow have you labelled them as harmless when clearly they harmed his girlfriend? Then you go on to blame her for general ignorance of other people lol. Your perception is beyond me.", ">Silent treatment and making excuses for leaving is a stretch for something that could be solved by having a talk \n\n\n\nYeah, bf is definitely better because he is texting and calling about how she is overreacting and embarrassing him. \n\nThat really is better \ud83d\ude12", "But you're not alone in a foreign country, and even if you were, English is so widely spoken that no English speaker feels insecure about it.", "There's nothing racist about thinking some languages sound better than others lol. I'm a native English speaker and I think it's a terrible sounding language.", "I just stated my opinion, coming from a similar situation. The first comment was highlighting that people can and will make remarks regarding different topics. A comparison between languages is something completely normal because people will have different ceilings when it comes to difficulty in learning or grasping a subject. OP is not in her country anymore and will face different challenges and is up to her how she responds to these kind of comments. \n\nMy justification for calling her an AH is that simple. She could have just talked with the person and clear the situation. Ghosting, making excuses or giving silent treatments are signs of immaturity and lack of experience.", "We do not know what her excuse was or what was her nonverbal/ paraverbal reaction to this. We just know that the excuse was obvious. Therefore, I cannot give an opinion on topics i do not have enough information on. She might have not embarassed him or she might have embarassed him irl. It was in a social context and a context where people were drinking. \n\nI won't justify bf's reaction by saying that he was drunk, because that is never a get out of jail for free card, but until more info, i cannot call him an AH, better or worse than she was. I just found her reaction to be blown out of proportion for the bf's comment regarding the language, not the culture, traditions or anything of the sorts.", "OP\u2019s BF is not a linguist or an aesthete, I don\u2019t think. He just decided to dump on his GF\u2019s heritage for no reason, and add that he can\u2019t be bothered. He\u2019s entitled to his opinions, and you may not agree that he\u2019s at least casually racist, but he sounds like a shitty boyfriend and an AH, drunk or sober.", "Yeah but would you tell someone with a different language that theirs sounds weird? Probably not if youve got any basic grace or social skills right?"]}
