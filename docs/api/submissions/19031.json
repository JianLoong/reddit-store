I mean you were not particularly tactful but he was pressing the issue so I can see how you would snap. NTA Also maybe consider he possibly wants to show you off as he likes you? Who knows?", "at the risk of getting neg karmaed, OP I think ESH.\n\nOP don't get me wrong, him constantly inviting you might be annoying and he sounds a little insecure with his thought of how you perceive him... it probably doesn't help that you're rejecting every invite he tosses towards you.\n\nWhere I think you're a little in the wrong:  unless he's annoying you or being insistent that you come to boy's night to the point that its becoming an annoyance, it sounds like he's trying to invite you into activities he likes to include you and form a relationship/bond with you as he recognizes you and your mom as a package deal.\n\nWhere I think he sucks: its clear that you're not interested in boys night with him, and despite this I can't tell if he continues to invite you to boys night to try and include you or if he's inviting you because he can't come up with a better idea. Either way I think he should put more effort into thinking of something else to bond with you over.\n\nOP unless you're genuinely against the idea of forming a relationship with this man, might I suggest brainstorming (with him) ideas on activities that the two of you (or three of you if you want to include your mom) will enjoy doing and get to know each other.  You don't have to see him as your dad's replacement, but as he will be around for the long run a more civil relationship might be in order.\n\nOP if you're against forming a relationship with him, might I suggest you show him this post and tell him that despite what he believes, you've accepted him as your mother's partner but do not see enough common interests or likes to form a relationship with him and that as long as he makes your mother happy you have no reason to hate him.\n\nTL:DR: Either tell him to stop trying to bond with you or figure out something to two of you can do.", "NTA. I would be uncomfortable if I'd be pressed to smoke and drink with older people. Talk to your mom.

I understand him wanting to bond with you and also him being afraid that you would hate or dislike him. I think I would feel pretty weird being in a relationship with someone and feeling like their kid hated me. Wanting not to feel like that is something I understand.\n\nHowever the way he's going about it seems wrong. If he really wanted to bond with you in some way or for you to like him he should have found out what you like to do or maybe asking you to suggest an activity together or something. \n\nMaybe your reaction was a bit rough, but being pestered for a month and needing to repeat \"no\" must be exhausting, so I totally get it.", "Doesn't sound like it would be too much (your not my daddy) drama going to one of these nights and it would probably make things at home alot easier.

It\u2019s a terrible way to treat your parent\u2019s boyfriend. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t even consider that she\u2019s the person who gave you the ability to party at raves in the first place. Are you sure you don\u2019t need to talk to someone to address your deeper feelings about your parents splitting up, even if it was for the best? It sounds like there could be something below the surface here and maybe consider that. \n\nLife isn\u2019t about being bored or not bored, and throwing the petulant excuse of \u201cif I give into this what precedent does it set for later\u201d is just another way for you to keep yourself in a power position. Truth be told, I bet that guy doesn\u2019t give a crap if you go to boys night and is just being nice to you  if you actually are a good person, YOU will stop being indifferent and maybe invite him to do something, even as simple as running an errand together. Bonding doesn\u2019t have to be about spending hours together, it also happens in the small moments. Your indifference is just making you a jerk. I feel sorry for your mom here because she\u2019s found someone she cares for and you\u2019re being a dark cloud hovering over their happiness simply because you are too cool (in your own mind). It\u2019s a shame because you may be missing out on an awesome opportunity here to make a friend or build a real relationship with another human. \n\nP.s. I\u2019ve been to all the raves, had the fun and been wild. Still am.

It doesn't matter if he's your mother's boyfriend or a work colleague. What do a man in his 40s and a teenage boy have in common? For some reasons, it rubs me the wrong way.\n\nYou weren't tactful and you were rude, yes, but before that you've repeatedly insisted that you weren't interested in hanging out with him, but the message didn't get through, so I understand why you were exasperated and where the bluntness came from.\n\nTry to clear the air by telling him you don't hate him or aren't averse to him.

I guarantee you he's not thinking about how much fun you will bring to the table, either.

I don't think going on a night out with him is going to cost you THAT much. You're talking about how bored those people are when you don't even know them. \n\nYou shouldn't be forced to interact with him, but putting a little effort into getting at least a bit close to a person that's really important to your mom could be expected of you. \n\nI think that after you go one time he'll understand you don't go well together, or maybe as a surprise you won't loathe the time spent together as much as you expected. \n\nIs it too much of you to spend one night smoking drinking and playing ?

He wants to break the ice and have something different than a chilly social relationship with the adult son of his girlfriend. Your response threw his good intentions in his face.\n\nI believe you should, instead of giving him a flat no and especially a no in terms that seem to be an attack against Mark personally, give a reason or a counteroffer.\n\nFailing that, I think you should permit him to make the invitation and regularly decline, which is its own social dynamic.", "NTA, I'm in a similar position with my mothers current partner, I dont care about him, not negatively or positively, I think hes a good guy and all, plus its my mums life. \n\nYou told him before without being rude, when he CONTINUED to bug you about it you snapped at him, maybe it hurt his feelings but I dont think thats a you issue. And yeah those \"Boys nights\" sound boring as hell lmao, especially if its just his friends, I would feel so weird there.", "Soft YTA/ESH. It sounds like he's overdoing it trying to get to know you, and needs to back off.

Probably because it reminds me of myself at  your age.

In all honestly, he is probably not thrilled about bringing some teenager to his party either (as a man in his thirties, I love you Gen Z-ers, but teenagers as a rule are difficult to get along with), but he is extending an offer to get to know you better.

You could have spoken to your mom or her bf in a respectful manner, but that's not something you have learned yet, is it?", "I agree with the comment saying he sounds like he just wants to bond with you and is insecure.

Sounds like you probably still live at home. I'm sure he is just trying to get to know you so its not awkward every time he is there.

You could\u2019ve just said you don\u2019t really enjoy going to them and that you and he can be cool if you just respect your boundaries.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: \n\n\u201cI appreciate you inviting me, but it\u2019s just not really my thing. I get you\u2019re trying to bond with me but honestly dude we are cool and you don\u2019t need to make this extra effort.\u201d\n\nBeing straightforward and to the point is seriously underrated.\n\nGuy obviously wants to bond with you - either to get in good with your mom or shockingly maybe because he actually cares about having a good relationship with you. \n\nSo, if you say, you guys are cool, you eliminate the issue with him, wanting to make sure you don\u2019t have an issue with the relationship.\n\nIf he actually cares about bonding with you, it\u2019s really up to you whether you want to entertain that or not.

Then if it works out, maybe it would be worth it to have a boring night of poker and booze sometime to reciprocate. Just my thoughts.", "Fair :)", "I also feel like he's inviting you to do these things because they are 'Adult things' in his head, and he's trying to acknowledge you as an adult he can bond with, not as a child. But in doing so he's actually treating you like a child by removing your agency from it and just telling you what you'll like.  \n\n\nIts a really tricky road for him to try to walk, and I can empathize with his position. Like the previous poster said, talk to him and explain why you don't like his plan. Then suggest an alternative, see if you can find something else to bond over.", "I'm happy to read this because that's what I would have suggested to.

You're not the point. The two of you making vaguely tolerant noises at each other to make your Mum happy is the point.\n\nHe's making an effort the only way he knows how, bless him.

I formed basic relationships with my mums 3 girlfriends from ages 11-16, 19-25 and 27-28, and none of that involved spending time with them individually. We hung out as a family, the first was a step mom situation, so it was family or sibling time, the 2nd was 2 women and adult daughter, again family time, dinners, weekend getaways where they let me have space as well as do stuff with them, 3rd was shortlived but the same basic thing. I think insisting you do any particular thing outside of a family setting - like persisting over and over, and getting upset when shot down - is unnecessary from a step parent figure person. Try different types of bonding or just be satisfied with regular family bonding? I also think be satisfied with any time an 18-21year old almost-step-child will spend with you, there's a lot going on when you just hit adulthood and at that age spending time with my mums gf was lowww on the list - but we had a good relationship and got along, like we once went to Silverstone formula 1 track as we 3 loved racing, hell yeah I made time for that, and then rode in a formula 1 car. \n\nI guess I'm saying NTA, this Mark dude is overcomplicating things", "I was the same way as you at 18. You'll get there eventually. Poker night isn't meant to be the same, it's not meant to wow you with the awesome highs. It's meant to be a chance to catch your breath and talk to people you care about. Maybe it'll never be poker or whatever, but you'll gain these hobbies and rituals with your friends eventually.\n\nYou don't *have* to go to poker nights, but you should see if there's anything a little more lowkey you'd be willing to give a shot with Mark. Grab a burger, see a movie, and if you really hate it and hate him, then hey, at least you tried your best. So long as your mom is dating him, you'll see him decently often, so if he's not a dick your life will have a lot less friction if you just play nice around him.", "I don't think it's about the cigars and booze. Your stepdad and his friends aren't teenagers, they're past all the 'edgy' stuff you and your friends think you're the first teenagers to discover.

We literally just got takeout and played games at my friend's house, but girlchild liked \"getting away from the boys\" (her brother and dad) and feeling like a grown-up.

I wasn't interested in getting to know him, and didn't see the value of forming a relationship with him. now I'm 23, and I feel badly for the disinterest I gave him when he was really just trying his best.

The foster parent continues to offer child the option (of a hug, a night light, etc) because the parent knows it may take the child a bit to warm up. Your moms bf is making an effort and maybe he wants you to see that he\u2019s making an effort. He cares about your mom, and by extension, wants to build a relationship with you. Likewise, if you care for your mother, you would be interested in building a relationship with someone that is important for her. That is one way of showing love. Like many have said, you don\u2019t have to go to a boys\u2019 night\u2014though, someone with some emotional intelligence may realize that it\u2019s in their family\u2019s best interest to do something they don\u2019t want to do for a few hours\u2014but you should certainly take initiative to suggest something else. \n\nAs a side note, this reminds me of a college boyfriend I had. He was atheist and his parents were religious. They wanted us all to go to the graduation mass at church during graduation weekend. My ex threw a temper tantrum, and ended up ruining the day for himself, his family, and me. His parents put him through college and his graduation was also an accomplishment for them, as it is for many parents. I saw it as extremely immature that he blew up over this and couldn\u2019t consider sacrificing after the many years of his parents\u2019 sacrifice. I broke up with him soon after. \n\nYTA for, one, prioritizing how \u201cfun\u201d something is over building relationships within your family; two, complaining about your mom\u2019s bf efforts without offering another perhaps mutually agreeable solution; and, three, choosing to remain indifferent towards your family relationships. On the last point, I\u2019d wager that your mother does care and value what you think about her life and May be hurt by your coolness."]}
