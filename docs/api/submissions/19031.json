I mean you were not particularly tactful but he was pressing the issue so I can see how you would snap. NTA Also maybe consider he possibly wants to show you off as he likes you? Who knows?", "at the risk of getting neg karmaed, OP I think ESH.\n\nOP don't get me wrong, him constantly inviting you might be annoying and he sounds a little insecure with his thought of how you perceive him... it probably doesn't help that you're rejecting every invite he tosses towards you.\n\nWhere I think you're a little in the wrong:  unless he's annoying you or being insistent that you come to boy's night to the point that its becoming an annoyance, it sounds like he's trying to invite you into activities he likes to include you and form a relationship/bond with you as he recognizes you and your mom as a package deal.\n\nWhere I think he sucks: its clear that you're not interested in boys night with him, and despite this I can't tell if he continues to invite you to boys night to try and include you or if he's inviting you because he can't come up with a better idea. Either way I think he should put more effort into thinking of something else to bond with you over.\n\nOP unless you're genuinely against the idea of forming a relationship with this man, might I suggest brainstorming (with him) ideas on activities that the two of you (or three of you if you want to include your mom) will enjoy doing and get to know each other.  You don't have to see him as your dad's replacement, but as he will be around for the long run a more civil relationship might be in order.\n\nOP if you're against forming a relationship with him, might I suggest you show him this post and tell him that despite what he believes, you've accepted him as your mother's partner but do not see enough common interests or likes to form a relationship with him and that as long as he makes your mother happy you have no reason to hate him.\n\nTL:DR: Either tell him to stop trying to bond with you or figure out something to two of you can do.", "NTA. I would be uncomfortable if I'd be pressed to smoke and drink with older people. Talk to your mom. Just tell her truth about you not opposing her romantic life, supporting her and not comfortable to go to boy's nights. You can offer them/him something alternative like movie night or hike or anything you could be interested.", "NTA\n\nGiving no as an answer should be enough. I understand him wanting to bond with you and also him being afraid that you would hate or dislike him. I think I would feel pretty weird being in a relationship with someone and feeling like their kid hated me. Wanting not to feel like that is something I understand.\n\nHowever the way he's going about it seems wrong. If he really wanted to bond with you in some way or for you to like him he should have found out what you like to do or maybe asking you to suggest an activity together or something. \n\nMaybe your reaction was a bit rough, but being pestered for a month and needing to repeat \"no\" must be exhausting, so I totally get it.", "Doesn't sound like it would be too much (your not my daddy) drama going to one of these nights and it would probably make things at home alot easier.

Your stronger, more fun drugs and raves probably are \u201cfun\u201d to you but where is your compassion, your class and really just general being a good human? Indifference is so rude and gross. It\u2019s a terrible way to treat your parent\u2019s boyfriend. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t even consider that she\u2019s the person who gave you the ability to party at raves in the first place. Are you sure you don\u2019t need to talk to someone to address your deeper feelings about your parents splitting up, even if it was for the best? It sounds like there could be something below the surface here and maybe consider that. \n\nLife isn\u2019t about being bored or not bored, and throwing the petulant excuse of \u201cif I give into this what precedent does it set for later\u201d is just another way for you to keep yourself in a power position. Truth be told, I bet that guy doesn\u2019t give a crap if you go to boys night and is just being nice to you  if you actually are a good person, YOU will stop being indifferent and maybe invite him to do something, even as simple as running an errand together. Bonding doesn\u2019t have to be about spending hours together, it also happens in the small moments. Your indifference is just making you a jerk. I feel sorry for your mom here because she\u2019s found someone she cares for and you\u2019re being a dark cloud hovering over their happiness simply because you are too cool (in your own mind). It\u2019s a shame because you may be missing out on an awesome opportunity here to make a friend or build a real relationship with another human. \n\nP.s. I\u2019ve been to all the raves, had the fun and been wild. Still am. But I know how to interact with those expressing care and consideration for me, even if they have fun in a different way than I choose to. Also, you don\u2019t have to be best friends to be kind.

It doesn't matter if he's your mother's boyfriend or a work colleague. What do a man in his 40s and a teenage boy have in common? For some reasons, it rubs me the wrong way.\n\nYou weren't tactful and you were rude, yes, but before that you've repeatedly insisted that you weren't interested in hanging out with him, but the message didn't get through, so I understand why you were exasperated and where the bluntness came from.\n\nTry to clear the air by telling him you don't hate him or aren't averse to him.

I guarantee you he's not thinking about how much fun you will bring to the table, either. Not everything is about maximizing fun.\n\nThat being said, it's up to you, he shouldn't be so pushy about it and he shouldn't be surprised at getting told off when he is.", "YTA, yes, you were being rude. I don't think going on a night out with him is going to cost you THAT much. You're talking about how bored those people are when you don't even know them. \n\nYou shouldn't be forced to interact with him, but putting a little effort into getting at least a bit close to a person that's really important to your mom could be expected of you. \n\nI think that after you go one time he'll understand you don't go well together, or maybe as a surprise you won't loathe the time spent together as much as you expected. \n\nIs it too much of you to spend one night smoking drinking and playing ?

He wants to break the ice and have something different than a chilly social relationship with the adult son of his girlfriend. Your response threw his good intentions in his face.\n\nI believe you should, instead of giving him a flat no and especially a no in terms that seem to be an attack against Mark personally, give a reason or a counteroffer.\n\nFailing that, I think you should permit him to make the invitation and regularly decline, which is its own social dynamic.", "NTA, I'm in a similar position with my mothers current partner, I dont care about him, not negatively or positively, I think hes a good guy and all, plus its my mums life. \n\nYou told him before without being rude, when he CONTINUED to bug you about it you snapped at him, maybe it hurt his feelings but I dont think thats a you issue. And yeah those \"Boys nights\" sound boring as hell lmao, especially if its just his friends, I would feel so weird there.", "Soft YTA/ESH. It sounds like he's overdoing it trying to get to know you, and needs to back off. And it sounds like you sort of went from incommunicado to ballistic on him with the 'rather watch paint dry' stuff, when you could have just said sooner some version of what you've said here -- that you don't think the activities he's proposing sound enjoyable and you would rather hang out with your own more extreme friends.", "YTA this is one of those things that could've been fixed with a proper conversation.\n\nI get that old man poker night is pretty boring but he's trying to bond with you.
