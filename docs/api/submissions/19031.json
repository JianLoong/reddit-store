I mean you were not particularly tactful but he was pressing the issue so I can see how you would snap. NTA Also maybe consider he possibly wants to show you off as he likes you? Who knows?", "at the risk of getting neg karmaed, OP I think ESH.\n\nOP don't get me wrong, him constantly inviting you might be annoying and he sounds a little insecure with his thought of how you perceive him... it probably doesn't help that you're rejecting every invite he tosses towards you.\n\nWhere I think you're a little in the wrong:  unless he's annoying you or being insistent that you come to boy's night to the point that its becoming an annoyance, it sounds like he's trying to invite you into activities he likes to include you and form a relationship/bond with you as he recognizes you and your mom as a package deal.\n\nWhere I think he sucks: its clear that you're not interested in boys night with him, and despite this I can't tell if he continues to invite you to boys night to try and include you or if he's inviting you because he can't come up with a better idea. Either way I think he should put more effort into thinking of something else to bond with you over.\n\nOP unless you're genuinely against the idea of forming a relationship with this man, might I suggest brainstorming (with him) ideas on activities that the two of you (or three of you if you want to include your mom) will enjoy doing and get to know each other.  You don't have to see him as your dad's replacement, but as he will be around for the long run a more civil relationship might be in order.\n\nOP if you're against forming a relationship with him, might I suggest you show him this post and tell him that despite what he believes, you've accepted him as your mother's partner but do not see enough common interests or likes to form a relationship with him and that as long as he makes your mother happy you have no reason to hate him.\n\nTL:DR: Either tell him to stop trying to bond with you or figure out something to two of you can do.", "NTA. I would be uncomfortable if I'd be pressed to smoke and drink with older people. Talk to your mom.

I understand him wanting to bond with you and also him being afraid that you would hate or dislike him. I think I would feel pretty weird being in a relationship with someone and feeling like their kid hated me. Wanting not to feel like that is something I understand.\n\nHowever the way he's going about it seems wrong. If he really wanted to bond with you in some way or for you to like him he should have found out what you like to do or maybe asking you to suggest an activity together or something. \n\nMaybe your reaction was a bit rough, but being pestered for a month and needing to repeat \"no\" must be exhausting, so I totally get it.", "Doesn't sound like it would be too much (your not my daddy) drama going to one of these nights and it would probably make things at home alot easier.

Your stronger, more fun drugs and raves probably are \u201cfun\u201d to you but where is your compassion, your class and really just general being a good human? Indifference is so rude and gross. It\u2019s a terrible way to treat your parent\u2019s boyfriend. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t even consider that she\u2019s the person who gave you the ability to party at raves in the first place. Are you sure you don\u2019t need to talk to someone to address your deeper feelings about your parents splitting up, even if it was for the best? It sounds like there could be something below the surface here and maybe consider that. \n\nLife isn\u2019t about being bored or not bored, and throwing the petulant excuse of \u201cif I give into this what precedent does it set for later\u201d is just another way for you to keep yourself in a power position. Truth be told, I bet that guy doesn\u2019t give a crap if you go to boys night and is just being nice to you  if you actually are a good person, YOU will stop being indifferent and maybe invite him to do something, even as simple as running an errand together. Bonding doesn\u2019t have to be about spending hours together, it also happens in the small moments. Your indifference is just making you a jerk. I feel sorry for your mom here because she\u2019s found someone she cares for and you\u2019re being a dark cloud hovering over their happiness simply because you are too cool (in your own mind). It\u2019s a shame because you may be missing out on an awesome opportunity here to make a friend or build a real relationship with another human. \n\nP.s. I\u2019ve been to all the raves, had the fun and been wild. Still am.

It doesn't matter if he's your mother's boyfriend or a work colleague. What do a man in his 40s and a teenage boy have in common? For some reasons, it rubs me the wrong way.\n\nYou weren't tactful and you were rude, yes, but before that you've repeatedly insisted that you weren't interested in hanging out with him, but the message didn't get through, so I understand why you were exasperated and where the bluntness came from.\n\nTry to clear the air by telling him you don't hate him or aren't averse to him.

I guarantee you he's not thinking about how much fun you will bring to the table, either.

I don't think going on a night out with him is going to cost you THAT much. You're talking about how bored those people are when you don't even know them. \n\nYou shouldn't be forced to interact with him, but putting a little effort into getting at least a bit close to a person that's really important to your mom could be expected of you. \n\nI think that after you go one time he'll understand you don't go well together, or maybe as a surprise you won't loathe the time spent together as much as you expected. \n\nIs it too much of you to spend one night smoking drinking and playing ?

He wants to break the ice and have something different than a chilly social relationship with the adult son of his girlfriend. Your response threw his good intentions in his face.\n\nI believe you should, instead of giving him a flat no and especially a no in terms that seem to be an attack against Mark personally, give a reason or a counteroffer.\n\nFailing that, I think you should permit him to make the invitation and regularly decline, which is its own social dynamic.", "NTA, I'm in a similar position with my mothers current partner, I dont care about him, not negatively or positively, I think hes a good guy and all, plus its my mums life. \n\nYou told him before without being rude, when he CONTINUED to bug you about it you snapped at him, maybe it hurt his feelings but I dont think thats a you issue. And yeah those \"Boys nights\" sound boring as hell lmao, especially if its just his friends, I would feel so weird there.", "Soft YTA/ESH. It sounds like he's overdoing it trying to get to know you, and needs to back off.

They could break up tomorrow for all we know.\n\nThe guy is 18 already, he doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to do just to please someone who has been with his mother for less than a year.", "You\u2019re missing the point. He isn\u2019t proposing spending a night with you to blow your mind with a wild time. He\u2019s doing it because he cares about your mom and she cares about you. It\u2019s not about the activity, it\u2019s about him making an effort to get to know someone important to someone he loves, just like you could make an effort to get to know someone your mom cares about. You can\u2019t give up one night of your \u201cwild raves\u201d to have a conversation with someone important to your parent? It\u2019s not only about you. Do you think he honestly wants to spend time with an insufferable 18 year old? He\u2019s so desperate to spend time with you because you\u2019re so cool? No, he\u2019s just trying to make an effort for his gf. Why are you so unwilling to make a minimal effort for your mom?", "i\u2019m sorry, i get the point y\u2019all are trying to teach him but this comment has me weak \ud83d\ude2d", "I think he made it pretty clear he doesn\u2019t love Mark, but is indifferent to Mark rather than hating him, so I don\u2019t quite get your point", "Not a bad idea. Thanks.", "beer and cigars are also both drugs anyway", "That's fair if you really don't care about forming a relationship with him.\n\nIMO, this feels like a very soft YTA for calling him boring to his face, but NTA for the way you rejected him.\n\nIf you didn't call him \"so boring that you'd watching paint dry\", it would be a definite NTA since he was being very pushy\u2014 even if his heart was in the right place.\n\nHope your mom helps clears this up for you guys!\n\nEdit: spelling", "Yeah, then that is really weird.  Having your Mom push him to bond with you (so her two boys got along) was the only logical explanation I could come up with for him continuing to push the issue.  \n\nIt's actually a red flag for me now.  He's only been her boyfriend for 6 months, and you're 18 not 8.  At best, he's not respecting your boundaries.  At worst...", "If I was a mum, I would also tell him to back off. 6 months is nothing, especially to do 'bonding' like that imo.\n\nSmall things to get to know each other? Fine, at least then it could just be a convo to say, yea man, I don't hate you, I just don't want to hang out with you.\n\nI mean. I love my dad to bits, but I don't want to go to drinking nights with him and watch ball games with him, doesn't mean I hate him, I just don't have those interests.", "But what is he being called out for? Not wanting to go out with his 40 year old mums boyfriend? \n\nYou\u2019re expecting far greater maturity from a young man who is already displaying quite a bit of maturity in his own way.", "Because I have no relationship with my mom, and haven\u2019t lived with her for 15 years. I see no reason to be involved in her life, much less her love life", "Fair enough, thanks for the perspective", "My mom and I aren\u2019t even close and don\u2019t live together, which is a big part of why I found it so weird", "Being snotty... Are you confused?", "So the answer is just that you don\u2019t care enough about your mom to make an effort based on your relationship. Why not just say that instead of whatever cringey nonsense about this poor guys poker night? He could plan an evening perfectly tailored to you and you\u2019d still not go. No reason to crap all over the guy for making an effort when that\u2019s not actually your issue.", "OP, edit this into the post.", "that could be true, of course I don't know the intricacies of their relationship intersections. but to be dialectical, relationships move at different paces for different couples, and i feel like 6 months could certainly be enough time for them to feel seriously about each other! and if the boyfriend wants to try forming a relationship with her kid, I think that's really sweet, even if he is fumbling going about it a little. maybe there isn't a \"need\" for it yet, but either way, it seems like he has good intentions, and kindness is free.", "No I\u2019m not, I\u2019m also not expecting an 18 year old to respond with the perfect maturity of an adult to a bloke who is fucking his mum and stepping on his boundaries in an attempt to cultivate a relationship. \n\nAgain, hope you were perfect at 18! Have a great evening", "I disagree. If he planned a perfectly tailored night that\u2019s fun, I\u2019d go for the sake of it, mother notwithstanding", "I differ here because I don't find this sweet. I find it really strange a 40+ dude is trying to bring an 18 yo not his kid into his adult friends group entertainment. \n\nOP said his mom was also weirded out and told him to drop it after OP told her. I mean, if I were his mom, I would not probably not be thrilled this dude was offering my under the legal age for most of these activities, kid booze, cigars and gambling. If this was my brother aka OP's uncle or long term family friend, doing this with my kid, okay, cool but not someone I've dated for six months. \n\nI also don't consider six months remotely serious. \n\nHow is this kindness? If the dude needed help, okay but this isn't help. He doesn't want a relationship with this dude and doesn't want to do this activity. I feel like that just leads to resentment all around.", "Why don\u2019t you suggest an activity you\u2019d like when he brings it up then?", "I have in the past but he\u2019s not interested. He\u2019s not athletic enough for boxing, he has zero interest in literature or philosophy, and he doesn\u2019t like traveling. Hence I no longer want to deal with him", "NTA. No means no. He should be respecting your boundaries. \n\nI had a VERY similar experience with my brother's girlfriend. She was constantly texting me and asking to come over and \"have drinks with her\" (code for: Get-shit-faced-and-dump-all-her-problems-on-me-because-she-has-no-friends). I did it once, never again. \n\nThe woman refused to respect my boundaries (particularly when I told her that I had given up alcohol altogether).", "NTA but you need to learn how to communicate better. No need to hurt anyone's feelings. You're old enough to not have to form a bond with a step parent and that's that.", "NTA. Why is everyone ragging on her when he\u2019s a much older adult who could also use his brain to find out other fun activities to do together? What if they all hang out together including the mom? Why is he so insistent on having her around his guy friends? She\u2019s a grown adult legally now who doesn\u2019t have to go if she doesn\u2019t want to. Being insistent probably just makes her not want to go even more", "YTA you\u2019re being quite rude. He\u2019s trying to get to know you and you\u2019re acting like he\u2019s beneath you that\u2019s why I say your rude. Just because you\u2019re some party animal that goes to raves with hard drugs doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy hanging around other people doing other things but you\u2019re young and once you mature you\u2019ll see that. Also once you mature you\u2019ll learn to respect and enjoy friends and family. All he\u2019s trying to do is get to know you and the way your acting shows your immaturity", "YTA op you sound like an entitled little kiddo lol", "YTA. Were you expecting this man to offer you cocaine and ecstasy from a neon jump rope amongst a group of sweaty self indulgent teens in a disgusting bathroom while twirling glow sticks and thrashing around to house music??  He\u2019s an older adult offering a very young man something a little more appropriate to bridge the age gap- I\u2019m sure he\u2019s well aware that it\u2019s not the ragers all the edge lords are used to frequenting. And maybe he wants to offer a little guidance because he\u2019s picked up on your casual attitude toward harder substances. But yeah, let\u2019s dissect how abhorrent it is that he would want to deepen his relationship with your mother by getting to know someone he feels is important to her in a setting that allows for conversation with some mild entertainment. Cripes.", "It\u2019s rude, but it\u2019s also what any 18 year worth their salt would say. Desperation is the world\u2019s worst cologne. I\u2019m sorry you have that going on in your world; perhaps having chats with them might be the best road to travel down.", "NTA. From the looks of it, it seems like he's wanting to get to know you better. Probably a case where he knows you're gonna be a part of his life if he goes the distance with your mother. Its a respectable goal on its own. The problem is that, yeah, poker night would probably suck. I recommend yall just have dinner with your mother some time to try and find some shared interests, then plan something from there. Either something neither of yall have tried, or something yall are both interested in.", "NTA.", "Soft YTA. He\u2019s trying to be nice and bond with you and you were super rude. You can say no without being an asshole about it", "YTA.\n\nHe's trying to bond with you and is treating you like an adult too. He must really like your mum to want to get to know him, so just go watch a movie and have a pint with him.\n\nHe's trying, I think you should try too.", "Sounds like he is just trying to bond with you, which is a healthy thing if things are getting serious. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t interested in that, just say, hey that\u2019s not really my scene but would you like to [fill in the blank with something less off putting you both might enjoy]. \n\nYou really can just politely decline though unless you plan to live with them for any length of time. \n\nIt\u2019s awkward when parents are dating and the kids are adults or older teens. Because this person could become a family member to you, so it is good to be in good terms, but they are unlikely to be a parent figure to you. \n\nI think your rejection was a bit harsh and you could say something like hey sorry I was rude I realize you are probably just trying to get to know me better, but the boys night isn\u2019t something I\u2019m really interested in, would you like to ______? \n\nSaying no wasn\u2019t rude, the way you did it was.", "Excellent suggestion. I was about to say the same thing, but you beat me to it. It's obvious OP doesn't want to engage in this \"boy's night\" with his mom's bf, but it's also obvious that \"Mark\" is trying to fit in. Having a get to know you talk with him may find a common bond they can both have together. Maybe it's not booze and poker. Maybe it's not raves and meth. But there's got to be something that brings the two of them together. Sports? Video games? Binge-watching Sons of Anarchy? I don't know. It's time for OP to find out.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It's fun for them but not for you and I would be bored too and I'm a lot older than him. He needs to accept that you aren't going to be buddies. There's a 20+ year age gap. You don't need to \"bond\" because you're an adult now and will be starting your own life soon. I would talk to your mother because this is too much. NTA", "NTA - Sometimes you have to be forceful to help someone understand you mean what you say. I'm sure there's conversations between your mom and her boyfriend about making sure you accept him to the nest, cause otherwise it might not work out for her and him. Clearly this is all about them. You seem to be handling the situation better than her. LOL No need to go to a rave with him like some idiot or go to a boring poker game. OP you got this.", "He's 18 but speaks like a 14 year old trying to impress the older kids", "So does he. But you are part of each other's lives now and it would make your mum happy to get to know him.", "To try hanging out on his terms. We can all try to make an attempt at being friendly to people once in a while. Even if we don\u2019t like them.", "Why do people like you make AITA posts when you are so deeply already convinced you're NTA?\n\nYou sound so fucking insufferable lol", "ok wo bist du gegangen, in welchem Klub", "OP is being an AH regardless of his age. The teenage level of maturity excuses it a lot, but not entirely.", "100% agreed. My guy friends and I didn't get into our \"poker, 2 beers and a Star Wars movie\" phase until like 23 or 24. You have to get busy before you can appreciate relaxing, when life is easy and boring, you need to chase your excitement in your downtime. After a 60 hour work week of programming, all I want to do is watch a football game and fall asleep with my cat at 10pm. 5 years ago I would've wanted to be out till 3am, drunk off my ass with a room full of strangers. \n\nI'm just hoping to share with OP that Mark is being genuine with the invitation, and not trying to give him a \"kid\" experience. Like you said, in a lot of ways a relaxed poker night is a lot more grown up than a nightclub is, but you need to be grown up to realize it lol", "He sounds a lot more fun to hang out with than you do.\n\nDo you really think he wants to hang out with the edgelord teenage son of his girlfriend?", "And sometimes as an adult, you need to learn when to take no for an answer. Mark has not listened one single time about even one kind of bonding activity over the course of how long being asked multiple times. \nIf it were anyone other than Mom's boyfriend, like say someone trying to date OP, or someone just trying to be friends with OP, everybody here would immediately be saying you don't need to hang out with anyone you don't want to. That also applies to family, that also does apply to people your family are dating. If someone doesn't get the message the first time I say no, they kind of blew any shot of me ever wanting to hang out with them even as a courtesy or decency. They can't show me the courtesy of respecting my no, so why should I show them any courtesy by giving them my time?", "To see if the top comment is convinced too, which in this case it is", ">Then the old guy decides to get squirrely and say that we wouldn't be doing anything he hasn't already done. It took everything I had not to call out the drugs just to prove him wrong. I am positive that he and his friends were never in a room with his father high as a kite with lines of cocaine laid out on the counter.\n\nThis man was ex-Navy enlisted, you'd probably be wrong. The navy is the place where a guy named Fat Leonard bribed an entire ring of officers with hookers in exchange for state secrets. I am positive a sailor has taken drugs before.", "True, but he is still an adult and you called him a teenager.", "He doesn't have to. Nobody says he does.\n\nHe's just being an asshole.", "They were talking about his mom. Presumably he loves his mom, and making an effort to hangout with Mark once would presumably mean something to her.", "How so? By turning him down politely for a month and finally getting fed up? I would have told him to eff off ages ago.", "Eh. That\u2019s like bragging about not getting a hangover when you\u2019re young.\n\nBy all means, do all the hard drugs you want \u201cin moderation\u201d. But it\u2019s also possible to party young and wait on the hard stuff til your brain develops. You won\u2019t miss out on anything but the bad stuff.

Nobody is saying be perfect. Pretty much everyone is saying just make a decent effort. Moms boyfriend is trying. OP has nothing against except how boring his parties are. That\u2019s snotty. Tell him you\u2019re not interested but you wouldn\u2019t mind doing XYZ. Not putting any effort into getting to know mom\u2019s significant other when you have zero reasons not to except you just can\u2019t be bothered is snotty. Just be decent. Make an effort. Go have lunch or something. 18 year olds are notoriously self centered but they\u2019re not completely incapable.", "My mum wouldn't expect me to 'hang out' with her 6 month boyfriend, she would be happy that I make the effort to have a convo with him.\n\nHow about, if someone says no multiple times, and turns down the offer, you take it like an adult and move on?\n\nOP even said his mother didn't know the boyfriend was asking, found it weird and asked him to stop.", "His mom didn\u2019t even know her boyfriend was doing this, so how is him not attending making her unhappy?", "Then party on. And maybe try not to be a condescending prick about folks who prefer a more mellow high (like someone who only wants to connect bc they care about your mom). That\u2019s not very PLUR and makes you sound like a poser idc how many drugs or raves you\u2019ve done. \n\nAnd being able to party with different types of ppl and ages is good for EQ, and just as important as IQ. Poker and booze parties can actually be a fun change of pace. It might not be your thing, but you\u2019re not above it as if Vegas don\u2019t rage."]}
