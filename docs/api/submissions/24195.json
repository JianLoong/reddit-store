My husband and I are very much type A people and like to keep a clean and clutter free home so we figured the color of rugs wouldn\u2019t be an issue since we and all of our friends don\u2019t wear shoes indoors at each others houses. \n\nMy uncle \u201cE\u201d and his wife, my godfather and his girlfriend, and my aunt \u201cR\u201d drove in from out of state to stay with my mom who lives in a few towns over from me. Mind you, \u201cR\u201d invited herself on this trip and since she is the baby of the family, no one told her no.\n I invited all of them over for supper to see the new home and spend some family time playing games etc. I put a sign at the front door asking them to take their shoes off as I didn\u2019t want to have to be bossy by telling them to take their shoes off. I figured they\u2019re old enough to read and be respectful. As soon as \u201cR\u201d walked into my home and saw the sign she scoffed and continued to keep walking so I said \u201cI really don\u2019t want shoes to be worn in the house so can you just leave them at the door?\u201d She then proceeded to scoff and storm out of the door, slamming it. She pouted on the doorstep and refused to come in for the rest of the night. My mom then continued to berate me for the rest of the night saying it is not that big of a deal and it\u2019s not customary where they are from to take your shoes off when entering someone\u2019s home. My uncle \u201cE\u201d spent the evening going in and out checking on \u201cR\u201d. My mom then made a weak excuse for all of them to leave saying that she forgot to do something at home.

The ground is dirty, we want our homes clean. I find it absolutely wild that people wear outdoor shoes inside their houses. Pout and cry about having to take off your shoes? That's absolutely childish and good on you for setting that boundary with \"R\".", "NTA. Taking the shoes off is a widely expected thing in at least Europe and Asia. We even have \"houseshoes\" you put on if the floor is cold/dirty. R is TA.", "NTA. I HATE it when people don\u2019t want to respect the space they\u2019re coming into. I too don\u2019t do shoes in my house because of sanitary conditions and because I like to have my feet free of shoes. \n\nI had this exact conflict with family and realized that I need to keep a basket with house slippers for guests. You can get them cheap at any bargain clothing store or IKEA. It helps so that people feel that they\u2019re still wearing some kind of shoe on their foot but it\u2019s clean for your home since they\u2019re only used inside. \n\nI would have done the same thing though. Don\u2019t feel bad about not letting someone walk all over you. You are justified in your actions.", "No, you are NTA. Your family sounds like a bunch of assholes though, kowtowing to the drama queen. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I hope your in-laws at least are better than that.", "NTA. In some country it\u2019s customary and in other it\u2019s just widespread. I live in France and my house is no shoes. Among my friends, I would say it\u2019s 70/30 (70% for removing the shoes).\nAs I travel a lot for work, I always take the hotel slippers so I can give them to people who don\u2019t like being in socks or bare foot. I also take some with me when visiting to respect people\u2019s home.\nYour house, your rule. IMHO, it\u2019s much cleaner to remove the shoes when entering the house. And when you have young children, it\u2019s really best. You can easily see the difference when cleaning too.\n\nGood luck with your family!", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.", "NTA\n\nI live in a culture where it's customary to take your shoes off. There used to be this little ritual of \"no, no, please don't take off your shoes, the house is a mess anyway\" (house obviously spotless because guests) and the guest saying \"no, no, of course I must\" and taking their shoes off, and then the host would offer indoor slippers.\nIf the guest doesn't take their shoes off, you just sigh inwardly and clean up afterwards.\n\nBut anyway, if you want people to take their shoes off, you have to keep in mind that maybe that person doesn't trust their socks not to be smelly, or is afraid their tights will snag or whatever. Maybe your aunt was embarrassed cause there was a giant hole in her socks. All of this is solved if you put 3-4 pairs of indoor slippers (fluffy, plastic, fuzzy, whatever, something that can be chucked in the wash and covers the toes) at the entrance and make it more of an invitation to be comfortable than a rule.", "NTA, but I think instead of banning her, the next time shes coming over leave some snacks, drinks outside maybe a toy or too.", "NTA.

Where I'm from, almost no one wears shoes in the house, and I always find it odd that people are okay tracking outside dirt everywhere. You're not obligated to do this, but if it's not the norm where you are to remove shoes indoors, maybe consider having some slippers available that people can wear (you can get them for 2 or 3 dollars at most bargain stores). I do this when my relatives come from the US.", "NTA. Your house and you can request it. People in the etiquette sub argue about this occasionally with strong opinions on both sides. That being said, it\u2019s always nice to have a bench or a chair or something of that sort available to guests who may be elderly or have mobility issues to make getting the shoes on and off easier as not everyone just wears shoes that easily slide on and off. Doesn\u2019t sounds like that applies here but just something to think about in general when decorating!", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a fairly common practice.

Maybe get some slippers though, for guests?", "NTA \n\nIt's really not complicated, your house, your rules. Who even cares if it's customary?", "NTA i have a shoe free apt. It\u2019s not that common here. My house warming was fun sock themed. I told everyone in the invite I have a shoe free home and encouraged all to wear their most fun socks or bring slippers. It was a good time and my friends often wear fun socks to hang out at my place. If you want to be fancy offer those cheep spa slippers to guests.", "NTA\n\nThough not a traditional American thing, it is not unheard of to ask people to remove shoes.  In fact that is standard operating procedure with mud & wet conditions outside in most places.  For R to choose to sit outside rather than remove her shoes and be with the family is infantile and ridiculous.  Your family is right R, should be welcome, but its R's own actions that prevent her from joining.", "NTA - I'll never understand how people DO wear shoes inside a home, its so gross. To me its common sense to not wear shoes in the house so i am always surprised when people tell stories about others throwing fits about having to take off there shoes.", "NTA - its your house, your rules. She behaved very immaturely.", "NTA. This is common practice in households of color.", "NTA, but this is a big generational thing, as well as somewhat a regional thing. It's your house, though. Set your rules. I do think it helps to understand where people are coming from, even if they are wrong, though.)\n\n(Places that have a lot of outdoor space, i.e., the south and midwest where people visiting go in and out the whole time they are there often don't ask guests to remove shoes. Obviously different for each home, though!)", "NTA. Your aunt is being ridiculous and dramatic for literally no reason. The streets and sidewalks are covered in human and animal urine and feces, along with many other chemicals and parasites. Your shoes pick up trace elements of those things. You have every right to ask people to remove their shoes before walking all over your home. For anyone to act like you\u2019re being difficult is just disrespectful and idiotic.", "Bruh. I don\u2019t understand why people freak out about taking shoes off. I don\u2019t have any culture at all and live in the US. I rather take my shoes off going inside someone\u2019s home and will be doing this for myself because my friends who do always have cleaner homes and floors than those who don\u2019t especially since you just got your house. NTA. Gives me the ick when people refuse to because a lot of times they think it\u2019s a religion/culture thing and hate it so much. So stupid. That girl sounds like a toddler and if people can\u2019t respect your rules, your mom included, don\u2019t invite them", "NTA, at all, *but* having some guest slippers or shoe booties handy for guests might be helpful going forward. R can stay out though.", "NTA. Your house, your rules.", "NTA.   It was a reasonable request and it sounds like she was just looking for a reason to be difficult.", "My sister has what is called \"the dirty zone\" where guests take off and leave their shoes and no one has a problem respecting it. The only exceptions are when strangers come to do work in the house or bring in furniture and she would clean immediately after they leave.", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules, and honestly OP you don't need to explain them. If I ask you to take off your hat to be allowed in my home, I do that and they \ncan either take off their hat and come in or not.\n\nAgain the in your house you can be a dramatic, selfish, spoiled, loud, and whatever IN YOUR OWN HOME.", "NTA. it's common in large parts of the world to take off shoes indoors and it's reasonable to ask people to respect your wishes in your own home. We have this same rule! R sounds like she has toxic always-the-victim energy. ETA we have guest slippers on offer in multiple sizes, and a chair for removing/putting on shoes right by the door for those who need it.", "NTA", "NTA, NTA, NTA! You shouldn't wear your dirty, germ-filled shoes in someone's house. If you can't walk without shoes, bring slippers or house shoes (or ask your hostess for some).
