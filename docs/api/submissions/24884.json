{"id": 24884, "submission_id": "15tssym", "title": "AITA for telling my son(22M) that he doesn't work but simply has a job after he complained about getting scheduled for 2 weeks straight?", "selftext": "My son recently graduated college and I let him move back in (for free) while he looks for an actual job. I don't expect any rent out of him as I want him to save up for when he moves out. He currently a server at a safari caf\u00e9 in our local zoo. Now my son had a great work ethic in school, he gradated cum laude with a STEM degree, but now he doesn't. He frequently comes home upset about annoyances with his job and customers, he himself has told me that he only does enough to get by, and he always comes home 'exhausted' after a shift. He complains constantly about things that are small issues and it leaves me annoyed as it comes across as him being spoiled and entitled. He complains about his hours which are less than 40 hours a week, complains about how hot it is outside, and whines that he doesn't get a lunch break when he again works at a restaurant and isn't working a full 8 hour shift.\n\nRecently he came home angry about another issue. He of course offloaded it onto me and told me that his manager scheduled him for 12 days straight starting after his next off day. This was apparently to compensate for a few of the servers going back to college and his restaurant being short staffed. I told him to look at the bright side, he would be making overtime on his next check and he would get more tables which means he would get more tips. He told me that he wanted his weekends. I reminded him that all he does on his weekends is sit in his room playing his PlayStation and that he's better off making more money. I told him that he was acting like a spoiled brat who was afraid of doing some extra work and that when I was in the military I sometimes worked 16 hour shifts for 4 weeks straight with no off days and12 days isn't that long.\n\nHe told me that he still didn't want to and that he was likely going to speak to his manager about it the next time he was there. I advised him against it and he said he just doesn't want to work for 12 days straight. I told him that he doesn't work, he just has a job. He takes orders and brings out food. Sure it's hot outside and he has to walk a bit but he's not doing any actual work and that he can call it work when he has a serious job, but for now he's better off just going to his job and raking in a little extra money to walk back and forth from tables and talk to people.\n\nHe decided he didn't have anything to say back and stormed off. The next day, his older sister called me to tell me that I should apologize apparently he was very butthurt by what I said and she felt I owed him an apology and that I was wrong to minimize what he's feeling. I told her that he's a grown man and he can approach me and demand an apology if he so chooses but if he can't defend his laziness I won't be apologizing.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692290736, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tssym/aita_for_telling_my_son22m_that_he_doesnt_work/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't expect any rent out of him as I want him to save up for when he moves out. He currently a server at a safari caf\u00e9 in our local zoo. Now my son had a great work ethic in school, he gradated cum laude with a STEM degree, but now he doesn't. He frequently comes home upset about annoyances with his job and customers, he himself has told me that he only does enough to get by, and he always comes home 'exhausted' after a shift. He complains constantly about things that are small issues and it leaves me annoyed as it comes across as him being spoiled and entitled. He complains about his hours which are less than 40 hours a week, complains about how hot it is outside, and whines that he doesn't get a lunch break when he again works at a restaurant and isn't working a full 8 hour shift.\n\nRecently he came home angry about another issue. He of course offloaded it onto me and told me that his manager scheduled him for 12 days straight starting after his next off day. This was apparently to compensate for a few of the servers going back to college and his restaurant being short staffed. I told him to look at the bright side, he would be making overtime on his next check and he would get more tables which means he would get more tips. He told me that he wanted his weekends. I reminded him that all he does on his weekends is sit in his room playing his PlayStation and that he's better off making more money. I told him that he was acting like a spoiled brat who was afraid of doing some extra work and that when I was in the military I sometimes worked 16 hour shifts for 4 weeks straight with no off days and12 days isn't that long.\n\nHe told me that he still didn't want to and that he was likely going to speak to his manager about it the next time he was there. I advised him against it and he said he just doesn't want to work for 12 days straight. I told him that he doesn't work, he just has a job. He takes orders and brings out food. Sure it's hot outside and he has to walk a bit but he's not doing any actual work and that he can call it work when he has a serious job, but for now he's better off just going to his job and raking in a little extra money to walk back and forth from tables and talk to people.\n\nHe decided he didn't have anything to say back and stormed off. The next day, his older sister called me to tell me that I should apologize apparently he was very butthurt by what I said and she felt I owed him an apology and that I was wrong to minimize what he's feeling. I told her that he's a grown man and he can approach me and demand an apology if he so chooses but if he can't defend his laziness I won't be apologizing.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

People are pushy, demanding, and rude and think they can walk all over you. You work long hours, the majority on your feet, and you make barely anything to compensate for it.
