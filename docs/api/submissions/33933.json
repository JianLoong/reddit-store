It\u2019s pretty clear most of the residents don\u2019t cycle on a regular basis ; the ones that sure do are me and a couple whom I sometimes run into. We never spoke more than the awkward hello until today. I got home and found a free space in the room for the first time in months, so I parked my bike there. It had a little chain locked onto it, and I felt a bit guilty for taking the space that someone had informally claimed, but I was tired of having to park my bike uncomfortably in between spaces, and I wasn\u2019t gonna just let a space sit there empty, so I parked my bike anyway. As I walked out of the room, my neighbours arrived. We exchanged a shy hello, I held the door for them, and the lady immediately pointed at the space and said \"you took my space.\" I was a bit shocked, so I asked what she meant, and she asked whether I could remove my bike so she could park hers. I asked again how that space was hers, and then her partner stepped in for her. Their reasons were that they marked the space with a lock, cycled a lot, and had been living in the building independently since its construction. I still didn\u2019t understand their logic, and when I asked why I couldn\u2019t park my bike on a regular space, he said it wasn\u2019t his problem. When I asked why should I give up my space to his partner, he said it was a question of basic politeness. I responded that my view of basic politeness was to greet your neighbours and to be friendly with them, I suggested we could have bonded over our shared interest for cycling, I introduced myself to them and asked them their names. They asked why should they tell me their names. The irony is that if they had bothered to be warm and strike up a conversation about the overcrowding of the room, I would have probably ended up accepting their request, but everything they said, along with their deadpan attitudes, made me more reluctant. I just stood there, unsure what to say, and he gave up and started parking their bikes. I felt bad, but I still didn\u2019t want to help them. I ended up leaving after saying \"have a nice day anyway\"\u2026 Reddit, are my neighbours justified ? I\u2019m pretty sure the problem was less about the particular space than the fact it was the only one left. If the room was empty and I had parked onto that same space, would it be a problem ? Why am I the only resident that must consistently struggle with parking their bike ? Why couldn\u2019t we agree to ask the homeowner\u2019s association to add an overhead rack ?

It\u2019s first come first serve.", "NTA - Similar to a parking spot on the street, it is a public space so first come first served.  That's it.  You owe them nothing and they owe you nothing when it comes to giving a public space.  In all that time did they think to give up 'their' spot to struggling you?  No they did not.  Oh well.", "NTA though maybe talk to your apartment manager about how some people are not using their bikes for weeks or months. Honestly I would invest in a hanging rack and install it in my apartment. Install 2 so you can have a friend over. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NAH - You're a semi-A for taking the space when there's a lock on it, but they were rude.  \nI agree that going to the homeowners' association would be more sensible... But then, why didn't you politely submit and say okay, but can you please support this motion if I submit it?", "NTA - Communal space = One can't claim it as theirs. \n\nTheir viewpoint is due to entitlement. Sorry this was not a better exchange. You should not have been asked to move your bike.  Best to you.", "NTA. There's no reserved spaces.  If they want a reserved space, they probably need to talk to whoever is in charge (and possibly pay a parking fee like any other vehicle).", "NTA. I have a similar bike rack in my complex and you can't claim a communal space for your own based on entitlement. I might be petty enough to lock a crap bike in that spot just so they can't have it because of their sucky behavior.", "NTA - Dibs isn't a thing. If those bike spots are not assigned to them, it is \"You snooze, you lose\" lol.  \n\n\nAnd the undertone is something I agree with entirely. If they had just asked nicely and been friendly the whole thing probably would've gone orders of magnitude smoother.   \n\n\nInstead they postured and were rude. EFF EM!", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand why they think they have a claim over this spot.", "NTA, they're used to their personally-determined privilege, but they have no more right to those spots than anyone else. Trying to \"mark their territory\" by leaving their locks there is just them being extra rude. \n\nIn fact, if they've lived there that long, there's a good chance you pay MORE to live there, which would give you MORE rights to the amenities of the facility (IMO). \n\nYou feel the way you do because they are clearly used to being able to intimidate people into giving in to them - the way that was handled, that's not their first rodeo acting that way. You were perfectly within your rights.", "NTA. what does a little chain locked on it mean? If it\u2019s their spot that is dedicated exclusively for their use, it\u2019d be written in their lease or deed or they\u2019d be paying monthly fees exclusively for that privilege to use the spot exclusively. \n\nPutting a little lock means jack shit. With that logic, You go ahead and put a bigger lock then. \n\nOtherwise, first come first serve.", "nta. so they think you should move your bike out of the communal bike rack out of politeness, but they should feel no need to tell you their names? i tell you what, putting a lock on a conmunal bike rack to \u201cmark your place\u201d is so rude i think it probably isn\u2019t even allowed by the buildings rules. just ignore these two in the future, they\u2019re not interested in being neighborly.", "NTA. Unless the spots are assigned to specific apartments or people, you can't just leave a chain there as if it's your permanent spot.", "I\u2019ve always admired people that hang their bikes in their flats. Mine is quite heavy for me, I\u2019m almost certain I would get tired of taking it off and hanging it back on a regular basis !", "Agreed. My building has bike stickers and does an annual bike audit. They donate any unclaimed bikes.", "Gosh I think you might be right\u2026 I really wanted to make them see we\u2019re on the same team, but the tension in the room froze my tongue\u2026 next time I see them I\u2019ll rephrase and report to you !", "If there is no assigned spaces then they're AH's for leaving a lock to try and claim the spot as their own. It's the same when you see people at the gym leaving their shit on a machine and then fucking off for 30 minutes while getting pissed if someone dares touch the machine they aren't using.\n\nIf there are no assigned spaces you did nothing wrong OP.", "Thank you for this last paragraph. I swear to god, until today, I kept feeling a glacial coldness from them every time we ran into each other. They didn\u2019t even look at me as they muttered their hello\u2019s. I always figured they must be unhappy people. Now I know\u2026", "Yeah, I think you can still get a good outcome from all this. If you apologise, say you were a bit out of sorts before, but that you'd really appreciate it if they could support you on a motion like this for the homeowners association that would be amazing.  \n\n\nAfter all...  \n1. Other cyclists might move in.  \n2. It'd be better all round if there were fewer bikes stored in insecure situations - that may attract opportunistic thieves.  \n3. It'd be better if there were a surplus of spaces, since we all like to have a spare for visitors (well, this was something I did in the Netherlands at least!), and to encourage more bike ownership...  \n4. ... Which in turn benefits everyone - with better safety, investment in bike paths, driver awareness, and of course the environmental aspects.  \n\n\nI think they were probably a bit taken aback, too, because you just ignored the lock completely rather than discussing it with them. It's confrontational. And I dunno, but I feel like a lot of cyclists aren't so confrontational.", "I didn\u2019t ignore the lock completely though. I kept asking how it granted them entitlement of that space, and they couldn\u2019t give me a rational explanation. I kind of agree with the people commenting that them putting a lock on the space makes them even more rude. What do you think ?"]}
