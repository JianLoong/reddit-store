Some examples include her not inviting me to her wedding (my husband and I were serious then), not inviting me to her birthday (v serious then), refusing to get her hair and makeup done for my wedding (I asked her to be a bridesmaid for my husband) which btw I\u2019m aware this is silly but every other wedding she went to that year as a bridesmaid - she got her makeup done - and at this point I was so sensitive to her that little things hurt. \n\nAnyway - The other week I texted my SIL asking her plans on where her son will be sleeping. She responded that her son should take my daughters (5 months) crib and she should sleep in the pack n play. I explained that this wouldn\u2019t work for us because she just started sleep training, we just moved her to the crib from the bassinet and I don\u2019t want to displace her from her bed while she\u2019s still getting used to it. She responded that since her son is bigger he should obviously get the crib because the pack n play will be too small for him and since my daughter is so young that she can sleep anywhere. At this point I was already getting frustrated but I offered to buy them a travel crib (for up to 50lbs) that he can sleep in since that should alleviate the size issue. She also declined this option and said that this conversation was ridiculous since I should just give them the crib and that she\u2019s trying to help me sleep train my daughter. \n\nAnyway - I again reiterated that I would prefer my daughter sleep in her own crib and suggested she look into renting a crib via babyquip and that we can split the total with them. To this she responded that that is not happening and she wanted us to pay for all the costs or just give up and give her son the crib. Anyway I told Her that the only solution cannot be her son getting my daughters crib and that very often things are her way or the Highway to which she responded maybe they shouldn\u2019t come. \n\nThis conversation was about 3 weeks ago and we have not spoken since. They\u2019re supposed to come next Thursday but Im feeling so uncomfortable with the whole situation. So AITA for not giving up the crib??\n\nEdit for context: the crib is currently in our primary bedroom. She does not sleep in her own room yet.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all so much for your input! You have no idea how much you\u2019ve validated my feelings and made me feel justified in my stance. I know it\u2019s also on me for being such a pushover and doormat all these years - I was always hoping we could become close friends but lol the feeling is very clearly not mutual. However, now she\u2019s messed with my baby and I\u2019m pissed tbh. I\u2019m making my husband deal with it and told him we have the pack n play or they can figure it out. Also that she\u2019s not allowed in our house without a proper apology. Idk if this is the best solution but baby steps? But I promise if she makes any comments re my daughters crib and using it while she\u2019s here - my pushover days are over.", "created_utc": 1669172657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2dk83/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_sils_son_sleep_in_my/", "score": 547, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If SIL gets her way, you can bet in the future that toys will go missing and your daughter will be constantly disrespected by SIL and her son.\n\nYou provided her with several solutions, which she all declined because she feels entitled to the crib.\n\nLike I said, your husband can deal with the issue.", "U need to explain to your husband everything and to u need to act and speak as 1.", "NTA. SIL is a rude guest.", "NTA. She can stay in a fucking hotel.", "NTA. SIL has all the gotdamn audacity.", "NTA. Just leave a pack and play in whatever room SIL is sleeping in and lock your own bedroom door. Otherwise it sounds like she will trying to kick you out (and your child!!) out of your own room. Or kindly refer her to the nearest hotel. In my experience, when you book a room and request a crib, it is usually a pack and play anyway.", "NTA, she sounds horrible! And if you don't stand up to her now, then she'll walk over you for the rest of your life.", "NTA. They are guests in your home. They don't get to pick and choose where their son sleeps. You are sleep training your daughter. This really isn't an option. It's her bed. You've given several other viable options SIL is refusing. She is acting incredibly entitled.  Just firmly say no. They either go along with it or they go to a hotel. It's their choice. Is your husband even backing you up on this?", "NTA. But you Seriously need to grow a spine. \n\nTell her She can bring a travel crib for Her child or they can stay away. \n\nDo not let her keep stepping all over you.", "NTA\n\n> she responded maybe they shouldn\u2019t come.\n\nSounds like a great time. I don\u2019t see a problem here.", "Protecting your INFANT is your responsibility, not managing your husband\u2019s relationship with his brother. Tell him that your SIL is behaving like this and is therefore unable to be around your child. Does HE not want his baby safe and secure in her own home? He can go visit his brother in a hotel.", "I understand it\u2019s hard to resist the peacemaker call, but most women would have told your SIL by now that she\u2019s a bad mom and worse aunt, and her kid can stay home and not visit if she can\u2019t manifest a place for him to sleep. That is a her-problem.\n\nAlso where is your husband in all of this? Why isn\u2019t he defending his own daughter? Did you tell him?", "6 words", "So what is SIL suggesting..... you have her toddler in your daughters crib in the master with you as well as your daughter in a pack and play? And they get the night off? Or do they expect you to disassemble the crib, move it to the nursery and then disassemble and move it again when they leave? \n\nWhat on earth is this women thinking? NTA Obviously, but you need to get hubby to stand up to her and you need to be clear,  daughter is staying in her crib.  The he's too big argument is ridiculous too, my almost 3 year old of average height can successfully sleep in a pack and play.  She's being dramatic and selfish", "No, the point to emphasize is not 'this is a fixable external barrier to you getting what you want.'\n\n\"The crib is in my room.\"\n\n\"Great, we'll move it!\"\n\nNo, the point to emphasize is that it simply won't be happening, because that is your choice.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know why you even argued with her. She provides somewhere for her kid to sleep that isn\u2019t your daughter\u2019s crib or they can stay home.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t give up my daughters crib for anyone else. Especially if she was sleep training. How entitled of SIL\u2026", "Well, as there has been no communication since, personally I would go with they aren\u2019t coming.  Make other plans, do not plan for them at all.  Tell your husband this, it is his family so he can deal with it.  When they show up, act surprised.  Your SIL sounds overbearing and used to doing whatever she wants, and she is just trying to have that same control over you.", "Is she insane?!?!  She clearly does not like you and I think it\u2019s best they don\u2019t come. Tell your husband everything and I mean everything if he doesn\u2019t know all the hx. Tell him how you feel and tell him you would prefer they not come ore that he tell your brother they are DOING one of the alternative crib options you suggested. After the visit (if it occurs) I would go NC with the SIL. In no world are you TA here OP.", "NTA, your baby, your home, your crib, your rules!\n\n\nIf she dosen't like that she can stay away", "NTA and saying that her son is too big to sleep in a pack and play is absolute lunacy. You said he's 20 months? I have a three year old who can still sleep in a pack and play in a pinch and he's tall for his age! \n\nThis doesn't sound like an issue with the sleep situation, it sounds like a control issue. Just like the refusal to get her makeup done for your wedding, she's trying to assert dominance over your life (maybe her spouse mistreats her? Maybe she got issues?) But it sounds like she's decided that she has to be in control of you and that's a huge red flag. \n\nDon't reach out to her. If she shows up, make sure she understands the sleep situation before you even let her in the door. First sign of disagreement from her, and she can leave. Make it clear she doesn't run your life, especially in your own home.", "NTA! You need to stop giving reasons/excuses for why she can\u2019t use the crib. The more information you give her, the more \u201csolutions\u201d she will come up with. Remember \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence and if you want, you can add \u201cmy daughter is using it\u201d, no justifying by saying you\u2019re sleep training, the crib is in your room, we can share the cost of a crib, i can get you a bigger play pen, none of that.

I don't want to pay for half the rental.  I already told you that you have to pay for all of it if you rent the travel crib!\" (Hopefully she responds like that and your BIL sees that his wife is being unreasonable and calls her out for her behavior)\n\n\"That wasn't a choice that I gave you.  Daughter's crib is in our bedroom and will not be moving.  No, you can't sleep in our bedroom with your son so don't ask.\"\n\nBest case scenario is BIL chimes in with \"We'll use the pack-n-play.  Thank you.\"\n\nAnother option is look into travel cribs and buy one for you to use for your daughter when you travel and use that one for your nephew.", "Nta. She is being rude and entitled. You dont come into someone's home as a guest and make demands. Tell your husband you are not willing to give your daughters crib to her son to sleep and they need to organise something themselves. You have been kind and offered compromises.. which she is not interested in. So let her sort it herself or have the baby sleep with them. Stand your ground.", "NTA. Don't let them in. Who goes over to someone's house and dictates where they sleep? And kicks someone out of their bed? SIL is irrational, regardless of the backstory.", "NTA \n\nHave your husband shut down his sister. She is not entitled to the use of your daughter's crib. You offered reasonable ideas and she shut them down.", "NTA. Stop bending so much, you will get f*cked that way.  Make it clear to husband, BiL and his wife in one conversation (maybe a text, hey, reminder for your visit to make preparations for your kids sleep, as SiL and I have discussed my daughters crib is not available \u2026). Everyone will be on the same page. No one can claim to not realize what was needed.  Least of all SiL.  And stop paying for people to come visit you.", "NTA. It's remarkably pushy and entitled to think that your infant should give up her bed.", "NTA Stop telling her what you would prefer, say no instead.", "NTA you laid out the boundary. Talk to your husband so he knows this is non negotiable before his sister arrives. I would also suggest ceasing communication with your SIL going forward. Let your husband deal with her. She doesn\u2019t like you and never will so why bother.", "Why should your daughter give up her bed for another baby? No. If I\u2019m bringing my baby somewhere I\u2019d make sure I brought a travel cot so that he has somewhere to sleep.

Period.", "Hotels do provide cribs or pack and plays, especially chain hotels, but they are almost always old and gross. It\u2019s really hard to sanitize a pack and play.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t get is\u2026 pack and plays are the same size as cribs. Unless the 20 month old is the size of a baby elephant, it will fit in a pack and play.", "Padlock the crib to your bed and lock the bedroom door", "Just fyi assuming this is a regular pack and play my kids could sleep in those until like 3 when we traveled. Maybe not ideal for a permanent bed but unless she has the world\u2019s tallest 20month old he can absolutely use the pack and play. Stop making if a discussion.

NTA.", "Near enough lol", "NTA Id reply okay don't come then, she is not entitled to displace your daughter in your own house you offered multiple compromises which were reasonable even offering to buy a travel cot. Id stop humouring her", "Close your bedroom door while your baby isn\u2019t in it because what are you going to do if she just put her son in it while you don\u2019t pay attention ?

But you keep saying you \"prefer\" your daughter sleep in her crib and then giving reasons.  What you need to do is say no, my daughter will be sleeping in her crib.  Don't leave wiggle room, shut it down firmly.  Don't give reasons because that leaves room for counter arguments.  Don't say prefer because it sounds like there are options.", "NTA.

Otherwise SIL gets the idea that there is another option when there is not.  You need to say it calmly and assertively so SIL gets an idea of your boundaries.\n\nPractice saying it.\n\n If you don't know how to respond, e.g. on phone to her, say 'I'll need to think about that ' (great with children too)\n\nIf she ends up coming, try relaxing all your facial muscles when you talk to her (works for anyone I dislike) You'll be amazed how differently you feel.\n\nGood luck and happy holidays!\n\nEdit- read your comments.
