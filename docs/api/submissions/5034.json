These are great for an in-state school, and Ella has already been accepted to a few. Her parents, Rob and his ex, on the other hand have visions of her going ivy league and love to brag about how the acceptance letters for Ella are going to start rolling in like crazy from Yale/Harvard/Columbia, etc... They both tend to act like Ella is the greatest thing to ever grace this universe and it shows. (Lots of divorce guilt from both of them.)\n\nThis is where I might be TA, I told Rob that I seriously doubt Ella will get into an ivy league school, much less even considered by one. Yes, Ella has good grades and test scores and she's fairly popular but that's it. That's really all Ella has going for her on her college applications. Ella doesn't take any honors or AP classes, she is not involved with extracurriculars, she doesn't do any volunteer work or community service, nor has she ever held a job, and she's not an athlete. That there is nothing stand out about Ella that's going to catch the admissions office attention at an ivy league school. She's a great candidate for an in-state school, and can get an excellent education there, but Ella has minimal to zero chance of going ivy.\n\nRob got mad and told me since I'm not Ella's parent I don't realize her potential or how special she truly is. He's right, I'm not her parent, so maybe there's something there I don't see. However, I feel like Rob is making Ella out to be more than she is, and a lot of it is out of guilt from the divorce.

Rob has told Ella to toss any acceptance letters that are not to an Ivy League school and to hold out for the best.\n\n2. Ella has no interest in going ivy.

Maybe you should talk to your boyfriend about it again but in a different way.", "yta. you could just let the rejection letters be the reality check they all need, or just talk to your so about being a bit more realistic, and maybe bring up that applying to a bunch of colleges that will reject you is a huge waste of money and time. regardless, it sounds like you could have just come off the wrong way with saying she has no chance at even being considered, and it could have been approached different if you needed to say it at all", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t your business to say anything. What were you hoping to gain from telling him that she was not going to get in? You didn\u2019t have to say anything because eventually she would receive a rejection letter.", "NTA. The part you added about him telling her to toss anything that wasn't Ivy should've been in your original post, it completely sways it imo.", "Rob was telling me how he told Ella to toss any non ivy acceptance letters.", "It's in my 1st edit.", "Go read Op\u2019s comments. She\u2019s not trying to bring Ella down, she\u2019s trying to get her husband to reality. A.) he\u2019s telling his daughter to throw out any letter that isn\u2019t from an Ivy League school, and b.) Ella doesn\u2019t want to go to an Ivy League", "Telling your kid they'll get into ivy league when they objectively don't have the qualifications is not support", "I want Rob to have realistic expectations. Ella has zero interest in ivy league. She wants to study art, not go to med or law school.", "Check out her comments. Ella doesn\u2019t want to go to an Ivy League school. She\u2019s applying because her parents are pressuring her to AND dad is telling her to throw out acceptance letters that are from non Ivy League schools.", "I think in this case it was necessary to say, since he is telling his daughter to throw out all acceptance letters from non-ivy league schools. He's sabotaging her unintentionally and needs a reality check.", "If you think Ella will get into yale (or Harvard or etc) You\u2019re delusional. Further the father has encouraged her to decline quality universities for his own delusional dream. Saying \u201cshe won\u2019t get into Yale\u201d\u2018isn\u2019t \u201cdiscounting her potential\u201d because her potential is not defined by acceptance to Yale. \n\nhowever, her acceptance to Yale IS defined by their admissions standards. Yale accepts 6.3% of applicants. They turn away students with perfect grades and standardized scores and sports and volunteer work and unique upbringings because there any enough room for all the exceptional students who apply. it doesn\u2019t appear that Ella\u2019s ever done anything exceptional in her life, and you don\u2019t get into Ivies by being good but unexceptional.", "In some ways I was hoping to give Rob a reality check. He's told Ella a few times to just toss any acceptance letters that are not ivy league schools and wait for the best", "Because Rob told her to toss acceptance letters to any non ivy schools.", "The outcome is dialing back the fervor from the adults. Have you ever seen the pressure families put on high school seniors? Have you ever seen a teenager cry because they didn\u2019t get in to Dad\u2019s alma mater? Admissions standards have changed so much, and many of us wouldn\u2019t get in to our own colleges anymore. Competition is vicious, and OP is correct that having no extracurricular activities, sports, volunteering or jobs, plus a less than (adjusted) 4.5 GPA will get attention from admissions. She\u2019s not even a legacy. It\u2019s genuinely not the end of the world if this kid doesn\u2019t attend Yale, or if she wants art instead of finance. These parents aren\u2019t *listening* to their daughter, or supporting her goals, and it\u2019s not healthy.", "Agreed. She definitely could have phrased it better, but I also get the feeling she has done that in the past and it didn\u2019t stick. NTA.", "I'd say there is no harm in applying, but there is harm in her parents not listening to what she wants and not being realistic. Ivy league schools are super competitive to get into. That's why the special classes, volunteer work, etc is relevant. If you don't have money and/or a name behind you, it can be hard to get into.\n\nPlus, they are telling her to toss any other applications. They are at risk of setting her up for not having any school to go to, which, even though college isn't necessarily needed for a kid to succeed, sucks if that is what the kid wants to do.\n\nNot saying that makes OP's approach the right one, barring any validating circumstances that may have rightfully triggered them to say what they said, but the parents aren't doing their daughter any favors by just telling her to ignore all other possible opportunities.", "I'm trying to help Ella by giving her dad a reality check. She doesn't want to go ivy.", "The dad is being completely unrealistic. If he's talking about this to friends and family, he's setting himself up for embarrassment (not that it *should* be embarrassing).\n\nIf I'm with somebody for 4 years, I want them to tell me when I'm being an idiot.", "We were on the subject when Rob mentioned telling Ella to toss acceptance letters from non ivy schools and wait for the best.", "I never said she's not special, just she's not ivy league material. Special and ivy are not mutually exclusive.", "Rob was telling me he told Ella to toss out any non ivy acceptance letters.", "Nope. I was artsy and a dreamer. So is Ella.", "She only delivered it that way, because according to Op, Rob is telling his daughter to throw out any acceptance letter that isn\u2019t from an Ivy League school. Ella also doesn\u2019t want to go to one either. Her delivery didn\u2019t suck at all. She was direct and firm", "She had zero interest in going ivy. She applied because her parents told her she had to.", "Oof yeah, NTA in that case.", "Then that\u2019s what you should lead with: suitability rather than ability. Saying she doesn\u2019t stand a chance is just needlessly mean and will put his back up. Saying that Ella wants to study something different, and there\u2019s an amazing programme at XYZ place is a lot more supportive. \n\nUltimately, Ella needs to study where she\u2019ll be best suited. Maybe you could engage more directly with Ella about finding the right thing and help her advocate for herself, because telling a parent their child isn\u2019t good enough for something is never going to go well.", "This information needs to go in your original post or it doesn't count. If you're worried about your boyfriend's daughter not having any option because she's rejected the school's she's gotten into, then you have standing to speak. \n\nNTA based on this new information. But, again, you really need to edit your original post.", "And I totally get that, but why bother saying anything when the reality check is going to come with her rejection letters? Let the letters speak for you here.", "But if she doesn\u2019t want to go to Ivy League and has her head screwed on she won\u2019t throw them out. If she wanted to go to one then it would be different", "So, have a conversation with Ella directly.  I would not care that her parents get pissed off. By filing her head with grandiose notions, they are doing her a disservice. They are also not listening to what SHE wants when she does not even want to go to an ivy league school. Tell her to keep all of her options open and to consider the schools that have the best art programs.", "Rob and his ex both have the stance of Ella will realize she wants to pursue med/law/engineering or whatever else they think she should once she's at ivy school and will give up on the artsy stuff.", "That's not the ideal way to approach that. And you're not the best person to do it seeing as how you're hatred of Ella is pretty obvious.", "Then that\u2019s what you had to say, not out her down.", "So, no then. Mild YTA. You may not think she'll make it but, there's kinder ways of expressing that sentiment. Your post reads pretty dismissive of the daughter's achievements and capabilities.", "You might fare better if you focus on what Ivy League admissions offices tend to look for. Maybe Rob is right in that you can\u2019t see how special Ella is, but Ivy admissions won\u2019t see that either.", "You are only helping her by telling them this.", "Just curious.  I've met a few ivy-leaguers that were very \"protective\" about it.", "then is less of a problem, the parents are for a rude awekening but let's hope the kid can follow her passion a have good college experience.", "This!!! If you care about the kid, keep the tossed acceptance letters and don\u2019t say a word.", "Eh she still a child essentially and she\u2019s going to be influenced by what her parents tell her so even if she has a good head on her shoulders she may still take bad advice from her parents.", "Me and Ella are fine with each other. I'm just mote out there than she is. Kid has no interest in ivy league.", "Ella has no interest in ivy league schools. She wants to go to a small, private, liberal arts college.", "So you are calling OP an AH because she is telling her husband not to set up his child for failure?", "Same. Dated a guy from Harvard, thar was a miserable experience. Ella has no desire to go Ivy and applied because her parents expected it.", "Or just take pictures of them or something haha. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re irreplaceable. You can contact the school and get the information you need to commit whether or not you have the acceptance letter.", "Maybe you two can sit down with her parents and tell them that. Might be easier for her if she has back up.", "No. I'm calling her an asshole for how she said it. You don't have to be an asshole when expressing concern about something.", "You weren\u2019t in the room. She could have said it in a nice way, but you are automatically assume she said it in a cold way. \n\nShe is explain what happened, not dialogue by dialogue, emotion by emotion.\n\nJudge the scenario not what you assume went on in the room.\n\nEdit: how would you express concern of someone getting into Ivy? There is not gonna be a right way to do it, just as an FYI", "I mean, I could make that same argument. You weren't there. She could've been a complete asshole. I was just going off the broader post and how I read it. I am changing my vote though because the daughter doesn't actually want to attend an Ivy League university."]}
