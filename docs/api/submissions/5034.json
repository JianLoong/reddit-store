These are great for an in-state school, and Ella has already been accepted to a few. Her parents, Rob and his ex, on the other hand have visions of her going ivy league and love to brag about how the acceptance letters for Ella are going to start rolling in like crazy from Yale/Harvard/Columbia, etc... They both tend to act like Ella is the greatest thing to ever grace this universe and it shows. (Lots of divorce guilt from both of them.)\n\nThis is where I might be TA, I told Rob that I seriously doubt Ella will get into an ivy league school, much less even considered by one. Yes, Ella has good grades and test scores and she's fairly popular but that's it. That's really all Ella has going for her on her college applications. Ella doesn't take any honors or AP classes, she is not involved with extracurriculars, she doesn't do any volunteer work or community service, nor has she ever held a job, and she's not an athlete. That there is nothing stand out about Ella that's going to catch the admissions office attention at an ivy league school. She's a great candidate for an in-state school, and can get an excellent education there, but Ella has minimal to zero chance of going ivy.\n\nRob got mad and told me since I'm not Ella's parent I don't realize her potential or how special she truly is. He's right, I'm not her parent, so maybe there's something there I don't see. However, I feel like Rob is making Ella out to be more than she is, and a lot of it is out of guilt from the divorce. (There was no cheating involved.)\n\nAnyway, I acknowledged Rob's confidence in Ella, but I also told him it didn't change my stance on things. \n\nAITA?\n\nTo add some details to the content:\n\n1. Rob has told Ella to toss/delete/reject any acceptance letters that are not to an Ivy League school and to hold out for the best.\n\n2. Ella has no interest in going ivy. She's an artsy kid and wants to study art or maybe design.", "created_utc": 1671379970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp20mg/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_his_daughter/", "score": 895, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't saying anything downright mean (and not to Ella personally), you're just thinking practically. The truth is Ivy League schools do look for all that stuff Ella hasn't done (AP, extra curriculars, jobs etc.) And if Ella is the artsy type, and chooses that as an educational path, it might be better that Dad gets brought down a peg or two before that happens.

They all started degrees and then drop out because even an AA was too hard.", "Opposite over here.  My daughter always wanted Med School but with her grades and MCAT scores, it's not going to happen.  Now she's been accepted to Podiatry school and we're hoping she goes next year.", "She won\u2019t get pushed into an Ivy League school because with those grades and no AP classes or standout extracurricular talent she has zero chance of being accepted, unless there is a very wealthy alumnus in the family willing to buy her way in.", "She transferred colleges to obsess over some guy she didn\u2019t even know. What the hell kind of premise for a show, I mean decision is that? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cPSbI1NhLF4", "Agreed but only if it\u2019s in helpful way. Is OP on the admissions committee? (No) Does she know for absolute sure that they won\u2019t even consider Ella\u2019s application? (No) Are there some mediocre students at Ivy League schools? (Yes) Therefore, her comment (that the child will not even be considered) is not helpful. What OP does know for sure is that you should not throw away other acceptance letters before you know whether you\u2019ve gotten into the school of your choice. This would be a helpful comment. It also addresses the \u201cdelusion\u201d in a way that\u2019s productive.", "Hah that\u2019s true, suchhh a stalker. For the record I was referring to how Felicity\u2019s parents pressured her into studying medicine but she changed her major to art a year later!", "Again how would you deliver it in a \u201cnice\u201d way?\n\nEdit: also I wasn\u2019t judging on how it was delivered. I was judging on the message being delivered. Big difference.", "I'm not really interested in delving into hypotheticals. I prefer to give my judgements based on the situations as they're presented and as I understand them. You're welcome to disagree though, I don't pretend my judgement is gospel", "Then you didn\u2019t do judgment properly cause you made a hypothetical situation on how it was delivered \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
