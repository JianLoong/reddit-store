I have a feeling that a lot of people are going to say YTA or ESH just because of a bias against gaming. What it boils down to is she\u2019s letting her temper get the better of her and is being rough with fragile and expensive belongings. You have every right to bring it up as destroying someone\u2019s stuff, even if they co-own them, isn\u2019t cool at all. It\u2019s disrespectful to you, not the controllers and that\u2019s what she fails to understand. Respect each other\u2019s belongings and property.

I have never slammed a controller of any kind onto any surface. Things are expensive. If I have to replace my ps5 controller every other time I play Elden Ring, I will not be able to afford food that month.\n\nNTA, OP, but maybe consider the time and place next time. If she's already frustrated, telling her to essentially calm down is NOT going to help anyone. Also maybe consider getting a cheaper set to use.

She needs to learn how to take breaks instead of breaking stuff, no matter how frustrating the game is. She should be mature enough to behave better than saying ''that's just how I am''.\n\nI also don't think that your wording was bad. After all she threw a fit because of a video game, not because of serious emotional stress. So yea, don't break things that are expensive or of value to others, just because you cannot beat a level in Super Mario.", "NTA. She needs to learn some restraint, you know just like any other adult. Saying that\u2019s how she is isn\u2019t a valid excuse.

I get it, I too am an emotional person, and I have a tendency to flail when frustrated, or a desire to throw things. but it's a split second desire, and I learned pretty early on that it's unacceptable, for many reasons, but especially because I'm also broke and don't want to replace things for reasons such as emotional outbursts. it's not an impossible thing to learn restraint. I wish I had advice on how to do this, but it honestly starts like many other problems- recognizing it in the first place. she knows it's a problem, but she thinks it's okay and normal.\n\nI hesitate to say \"treat her like a child\" in this instance, but honestly, it's what I would do- if she's going to be acting childish at least. \"if you're not going to play nice with my things, then I won't be playing with you.\" if you can figure out a better way to word that, then I recommend it and commend you.\n\nI wish you luck.", "Yeah, I had this conversation with my kid when he was 10.

This controller is now mine and if he wants to play he has to save up and buy his own because he's 15 and I shouldn't be having the same conversations now as we had 5 years ago.\n\nSo take your special controllers away from here and make her get her own.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t know", "YTA for being patronizing and a little absurd.
