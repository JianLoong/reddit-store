We weren't doing to great on the first world and I suggested we go back, get some power-ups, and then come back to it but she refused and wanted to keep trying the level as the small versions of the characters. Well after another 5 or 6 more times of failing she got really frustrated and slammed the controller on her leg and mashed the buttons pretty hard out of frustration. These were joycons, which are already very easy to break, but they were also limited edition ones that cost $150 for the set and we really don't have the money to replace them. I told her, \"Please don't disrespect them like that.\" She got angry put the controllers on her chair and stormed off. \n\nWe then spent some time in the morning doing our own things and then I tried to revisit the subject after she got out of the shower. I apologized for getting upset but tried to tell her that the controllers are fragile and can break easily. She responded with, \"When I game I have a tendency to throw my hands down in frustration, I do the same when I'm playing on pc and my hands slam into the keyboard.\" I don't do that as the things I have are a bit expensive to replace. (Now that doesn't mean I haven't dropped my controllers unintentionally or they haven't fallen off my desk) I feel like I could've asked her a little nicer but  I don't like that she mashed the controller in frustration. There are healthier ways she could express that frustration and I even gave her the option to go back and get power-ups multiple times.", "created_utc": 1699200975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ofbeu/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_was_being/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because \u201cthrowing my hands\u201d is her typical response doesn\u2019t at all make it the right response. \n\nI\u2019ll say this about anyone, any outburst of physical violence (however big or small) as a result of a video game is not at all a normal behaviour, nor should it be normalized. \n\nYou\u2019re completely right that the controllers are expensive and hard to replace. She clearly doesn\u2019t value them as much as you do. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThat game can be really frustrating but there is just no excuse for slamming controller possibly damaging it.  \n\n\nShe needs to know when to take a break from the game to calm down.  \n\n\nYou could've said it tiny bit better but in the end you are right if she breaks the joy con then not only she lost but you lost means to play until you replace the joycons.", "Nta but she is.  She admitted she acts childish when playing a game. Time for her to take responsibility for her behavior and grow up.  Sounds like you are playing with an 8 year old that has not learned to control their emotions.", "NTA. I have a feeling that a lot of people are going to say YTA or ESH just because of a bias against gaming. What it boils down to is she\u2019s letting her temper get the better of her and is being rough with fragile and expensive belongings. You have every right to bring it up as destroying someone\u2019s stuff, even if they co-own them, isn\u2019t cool at all. It\u2019s disrespectful to you, not the controllers and that\u2019s what she fails to understand. Respect each other\u2019s belongings and property. This should be common courtesy.\n\nThere are healthier ways to vents some steam or relieve frustrations. I like to go into my bedroom and punch my pillow. No harm done.", "does she also punch holes in the drywall when her stepdad takes away her vape", "NTA - she needs to get her temper under control", "NTA - if you bought these controllers, I think the easiest solution is to ask her not to use them.    Why would you let her use your stuff when she has made it clear she will intentionally slam it onto things whenever she feels like it?", "I have rage quit many a game. I have never slammed a controller of any kind onto any surface. Things are expensive. If I have to replace my ps5 controller every other time I play Elden Ring, I will not be able to afford food that month.\n\nNTA, OP, but maybe consider the time and place next time. If she's already frustrated, telling her to essentially calm down is NOT going to help anyone. Also maybe consider getting a cheaper set to use. Walmart has a set (granted that isn't licensed Nintendo) for something like 35-40 bucks. Might be worth the investment, especially if you're attached to the limited edition ones", "NTA. She needs to learn how to take breaks instead of breaking stuff, no matter how frustrating the game is. She should be mature enough to behave better than saying ''that's just how I am''.\n\nI also don't think that your wording was bad. After all she threw a fit because of a video game, not because of serious emotional stress. So yea, don't break things that are expensive or of value to others, just because you cannot beat a level in Super Mario.", "NTA. She needs to learn some restraint, you know just like any other adult. Saying that\u2019s how she is isn\u2019t a valid excuse. She\u2019s free to break her own stuff and waste her own money, but since this is shared she needs to respect that it is yours as well.", "NTA. I get it, I too am an emotional person, and I have a tendency to flail when frustrated, or a desire to throw things. but it's a split second desire, and I learned pretty early on that it's unacceptable, for many reasons, but especially because I'm also broke and don't want to replace things for reasons such as emotional outbursts. it's not an impossible thing to learn restraint. I wish I had advice on how to do this, but it honestly starts like many other problems- recognizing it in the first place. she knows it's a problem, but she thinks it's okay and normal.\n\nI hesitate to say \"treat her like a child\" in this instance, but honestly, it's what I would do- if she's going to be acting childish at least. \"if you're not going to play nice with my things, then I won't be playing with you.\" if you can figure out a better way to word that, then I recommend it and commend you.\n\nI wish you luck.", "Yeah, I had this conversation with my kid when he was 10. I told him to be respectful of the controllers as they're expensive (these were wiimotes and PS3 controllers then) and if he throws a tantrum like that I won't be buying more.\n\nSo he had to spend his birthday money buying me a new controller then and hell he's 15 now and just had to drop 100bucks on a PS5 controller he \"dropped\". This controller is now mine and if he wants to play he has to save up and buy his own because he's 15 and I shouldn't be having the same conversations now as we had 5 years ago.\n\nSo take your special controllers away from here and make her get her own.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t know", "YTA for being patronizing and a little absurd. Her being rough with a controller is not \"disrespectful\" of the item. Being precious about how hard she pushes a button is going to be annoying. Just let her know that you want to make sure the expensive controller doesn't get damaged so when either of you get super frustrated, taking a break is going to be the beat option. Then if she slams it or throw it, tell her you'd prefer her to get a set for herself to use if she's going to game so your set doesn't get broken.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
