The rest were welcome to Facetime us, but they would have to wait to see our son after we'd gone home and had time to adjust to having a newborn. \n\nI'm not close with my family because I left home at 18 to escape their abuse. Almost none of them are allowed contact with my child because of the way they treated me and my siblings. \n\nMy fiance's family are a very close-knit group, and all of them have been very kind and welcoming to me up until this point. I wouldn't be marrying in if they weren't. The only one I've had issues with is my fiance's brother (30M) who has autism.

He hasn't worked a day in his life and lives off of his parents. He does not shower or even bother to apply deodorant before leaving the house.

He's not clean. But you say \"\u00a0He's diagnosed with autism but does not have any severe disabilities\" but the way autism manifests as a disability varies and includes issues with executive function and self care including hygiene. The disability may not be obvious for little kids if their parents do their laundry, pick out their clothes, and enforce hygene rules (bath time, did you brush your teeth? etc). The disability related limitations become apparent when the individual gets to the age that they shouldn't need prompting/should be able to take care of themselves. It's hard to form habits, hard to do something if it requires multiple steps.  \"He does not shower or even bother to apply deodorant before leaving the house. He would literally live in the same clothes for months if not for his mom doing his laundry.\" All of that sounds like a disability related limitation. \n\nBut - if his parents are taking care of him they need to be helping him. Making sure he practices hygene and if they can't do it, they need to look into getting services to assist him. It's not helping him to just enable his lack of hygiene.", "NTA but you could tell this exactly story without reference to autism and it would convey everything relevant.

Newborns are very susceptible to disease. Good call on not letting a visibly dirty man hold him.", "Mmmmm I'm torn. You keep saying autistic as though that's a reason to not trust him with the baby. Him being autistic doesn't have anything to do with his ability to hold and care for a child. Your issue is with his heygeine, not his disability. If you want to keep in good with the famiky you and your hubs need to sit with his parents alone and tell them- you don't care that he is autistic you care that he seams to not care abouthl his heygeine and with a new baby your concerned. If they can gwt him to bathe and take care of himself, you would be happy to start letting him be more involved. \n\n\nI work with kids up to 22 who are autistic or have severe issues. When a kid hits 18, they aren't given the same support or help that someone still in school gets. He could be without the push and support, the routine to do it, and the backup to encourage him. I would spend some time doing research on adults with autism and learn how to support and talk with him so he feels included. You can tell him, he bro, we love you, and we want you involved, but to do that, we need to work together and start doing\n- daily showers\n- using kind soft words around the baby\n- not texting mean things when you don't understand why something is the way it is\n\nExplained how you're a new mom, and we are all figuring it out. Tell him to his face- I want you involved. Can we start working on the above steps together  to get you there?", "NTA. You are just looking out for the safety of your baby.\n\nAs someone that works with autistic adults, poor hygiene is very common. How comfortable are you talking to your in laws about this or your fianc\u00e9? They can all implement a plan in place to help your BIL with a routine in hygiene. A great way to do this is have a visual chart, with a step by step chart. Depending on the severity, it might have to be simplified starting with turning the water on to hot/warm, getting in the shower, applying soap, rinse, shampoo first then conditioner, rinse, etc etc. Or just do shower, shampoo, conditioner, body wash.\n\nSince those with autism like to follow routine, it would also be a good idea for him to start build some independence and do his own chores around the house like just his laundry but start off with one thing at a time. I recommend you look in your area for resources of different autism funding programs that helps adults (like my job)\n\nGood luck!", "Hey, NTA but I\u2019d like you to speak to your husband about his diagnosis. Autism doesn\u2019t fit all these symptoms and it\u2019s very normal for men to develop schizophrenia or a more mild version between 18-25, if that\u2019s where the hygiene and oddness stems from(a very common symptom) he might have additional needs that could get better with proper support.

No one is owed the privilege of holding your newborn except (arguably) the other parent.

Don't be in too much of a hurry, though, especially since your comment about your brother makes me think you also went through parentification at a young age. You went through things that forced you to (cliche alert) grow up too fast, so you missed out on common experiences people have as kids. And having a baby at 19 means you'll miss out on common experiences young adults have.\n\n\nDo not let anyone talk down to you. Embrace doing kid-centred things with your baby now, and as they grow up. Having a kid is a good excuse for bright colours and fun activities, and it's perfectly okay to embrace that and let yourself enjoy it too. \n\nYou are the person who will know your kid best, and what works for their personality. Trust yourself. \n\nSecond-hand clothes are your best friend, especially in the first 3-4 years. Babies grow so fast in the first year particularly that a lot of second-hand clothes are basically brand new. And resale value tends to be low, so you can get a lot for very little through online groups or Buy Nothing groups in your local area.\n\nIf you're googling health stuff (we all do it), trustworthy info is more likely to come from .gov or .org sources\n\n Mother's groups can be great or they can be terrible.

My aunt was not allowed to hold her own grandchildren because she was too dirty. Her daughter made her shower and change into clothes my grandma had washed before she could hold the baby. This was mainly due to cigarette smoke, but also general dirtiness including having a lot of dirty pets. I am sure she was offended but she did it because she wanted to hold her granddaughters. Set some ground rules, with your husband to set for his brother, he must be freshly showered and in clean clothes with clean hands to hold the baby.

Obviously the story is a little more nuanced and took place over a few years, but I agree that it's really hard to believe that symptoms are played up unless there is a NOTICEABLE benefit/advantage to doing so that outweighs the benefit of their accomplishments and overall well being so if BIL has learned a way to get what he needs in specific circumstances based on what's being allowed then it's possible?

I expect that\u2019s what the other poster meant, not that they can\u2019t shower when they\u2019re already dealing with sensory overwhelm\n\nOf course there\u2019s still a responsibility to maintain hygiene (particularly if he wants to hold the baby). OP is very much NTA. What I\u2019m pushing back on is your claim that there\u2019s no reason for an autistic person not to wash when like\u2026 autistic people are sitting here giving you reasons. It doesn\u2019t change anything fundamentally- ND people have the same hygiene needs as everyone else, but to say we have no reason is just flat out wrong.", "This is really cool, TIL! Apologies if I offended anyone with my first comment. I\u2019m going to leave it up for others to get educated though! I never would have learned this otherwise.", "This is very interesting.  I get frustrated sometimes because there needs to be a better way to differentiate between, say, a completely non-verbal, non-communicative person and students I teach in my college public speaking courses.  Using a single label for both feels like the label is meaningless.", "I didn\u2019t say it was normal but you acted like it\u2019s some minor thing. To my brother taking a shower feels like needles and water feels too slippery. It\u2019s not his fault. \n\nI did say it\u2019s not valid to not want a dirty person holding a child. That goes for anyone.", "Thanks for listening!", ">Using a single label for both feels like the label is meaningless.\n\nYeah, that's the point.", "And I never said it was minor, but we can\u2019t just blame her reaction on ignorance.\n\nShe\u2019s not being ignorant. BIL sounds disgusting. I came here prepared to call her an ass, but she was never an ass, nor was she ignorant.", "Of course\u2014 thanks for approaching it with education > humiliation. Lots of people aren\u2019t the best at that. Im giving those articles a read now, they look really interesting!"]}
