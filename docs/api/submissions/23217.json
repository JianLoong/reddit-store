One could almost consider it kinda like a favor to their mom.\n\nYou are two grown ass adults living with your parents, and you are worrying about your ps5 instead of getting your shit together. Grow up man\u2026\n\nI call for YTA. If you don\u2019t want your mom to tell you what to do with your stuff, move out or at least pay rent.", "I definitely agree he's a AH because it's his parents house", "Lol. Imaging going NC with your own mother over a ps5. And you actually got upvotes. Wtf is wrong with reddit?", "Or better yet, the kids can bring some books or cards or play outside and leave his stuff alone?", "How is it reasonable to expect someone to let two random kids to play with your expensive gaming system?", "I didnt mean he is the AH. He definitely is not because it's his ps5, I was saying he would be if he'd do what the other guy said about the check and asking for money!", "> That doesn't give her the right to invite random children over to play with his toys. He could be 7 or 27, it doesn't matter, his belongings are not hers to offer to anyone.\n\nWell no, but the limited finances probably mean the OP cannot buy their mother a PS5, which I suspect is the point the person you replied to was trying to make.", "These children attending has parents that will also be attending. These parents can watch and entertain their own children. If they need a break from their kids, get a sitter and leave them at home.", "They live there for free I\u2019m guessing and you guys are advising lawsuits to cover the cost of a PlayStation controller which is likely the only thing a young kid could break.", "They can, but the Mum really wants them to focus on her birthday party and that\u2019s perfectly reasonable. And as a son that lives off your mums money helping her with that request should be something you are willing to do.\n\nBecause you know with 27 years, he should be able to live on his own. And if you can\u2019t, you might have to think about other things you can provide.", "Roof,", "I do. My oldest goes off to college next month. My youngest is starting his first year of football. I do my very best to support them emotionally and financially. They are the most precious and important people in my whole world. They know I love them unconditionally and nothing will ever change that.\n\nThat being said, I also provide tough love, when necessary. I\u2019m not raising entitled snowflakes. I\u2019m raising self sufficient, accountable, empathetic and caring young humans. It\u2019s ok to tell them when they\u2019re acting like an entitled brat. They know the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them. They understand that they will have to forge their own way, I can only provide love and guidance. They are free to become their own people. My philosophy is the more you give, the more blessings you receive. I\u2019m not particularly religious but I believe in the concept of karma. \n\nIf you have no problem accepting handouts and freebies but can\u2019t be bothered to share or lend a hand to those who\u2019ve been generous to you, I believe you\u2019re a flawed and selfish individual. That\u2019s my philosophy. You don\u2019t need to agree. Keep telling your kids they\u2019re super special and it\u2019s ok to be greedy with their material possessions. Let me know how that works out. OP here is exhibit A", "It is entirely possible the PS5 predates the financial issues. He mentioned he's got PS+ so doesn't even have to buy individual games. Spending the $10-$20 a month or however much it is for a yearly subscription isn't gonna cause the sort of financial hardship you think it is.", "I'm so sorry for your kids that you think their property is yours if you help them.", "You know nothing of how he treated me. I already said it wasn\u2019t good. Don\u2019t downplay someone else\u2019s trauma"]}
