She originally said she got car sick, so I went with it for a long time, even though it made me feel uncomfortable. \n\nIt has been bothering me more and more lately. Especially when we are at social events and everyone's leaving and I'm sitting in the passenger seat waving bye to everyone getting into their cars, feeling like a child.\n\nI brought it up in a marriage counseling session recently (this is more of a maintenance type thing that we've been doing for a long time), and our counselor recommended that she give me a chance driving. She wasn't happy at all but agreed to try it out. \n\nEvery time I've driven now she has been extremely bitter. She'll sit in the passenger seat stewing away in anger. One word responses, very cold. She mentioned that \"this is the one thing that I can control and now I don't have that.\" (Funny enough didn't mention car sickness at all). \n\nIt's been 5 or 6 times now that we've done this. Each time I bring it up she gets pissed off. She won't refuse, but she will be miserable. \n\nI'm not going to lie, my reasoning for wanting to drive is that I believe the husband should. It's embarrassing for me when others see me sitting in the passenger seat being driven by my wife. It's emasculating. When I started driving my daughter even asked me why I was driving, when I responded \"Daddy's drive too\" she responded with \"but you dont!\". \n\nHer reasoning is that she get's car sick (but hasn't complained about it once being in the passenger seat) and that she loses some sort of control. She has stated that she hates that our Counselor gave that suggestion.  \n\nAITA for wanting to be the driver when we go places as a family? Should I just let her drive and deal with it even though it makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit disrespected as a Husband. \n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I appreciate the opinions, however harsh they were.

Lots of people get carsick if they aren't driving. And feeling like you are about to throw up fucking sucks.

And I'm betting of your wife stopped forcing herself not to puke in the car while you were driving you would not see it as your fault and you probably wouldn't help clean it up. Of course your wife is upset about losing control, control over not feeling like shit. How lovely of you to do that to her because of your insecurity problem.", "YTA. You really need to be going to counselling on your own, because this is the most pathetic thing I've ever heard. Your ego must be both enormous and incredibly fragile.", "YTA. Also the point about her not bringing up feeling sick seems ify to me. You have already shown you don\u2019t care by forcing the switch so why should she continue to tell you?

Sounds like she is expressing that she doesn't have control in other areas of her life.\n\nI say ESH because this seems like a power struggle and lack of proper communication on both parts. I applaud you for going to marriage counseling. Keep going and dig a little deeper. It seems like this driving thing is just the tip of the iceberg.", "I get motion sickness and always drive. My husband enjoys it because he can read or nap.", "Whoa, YTA.\n\nMotion sickness has nothing to do with how smoothly or not someone drives. Your eyes are telling you that you're in motion, but your inner ear gives conflicting info since you're sitting still and voila -- motion sickness.\n\nI say this as someone who has been prone to motion sickness pretty much my whole life. Thank heavens for dramamine and wrist bands. I would get sick quickly without some preventive measures, like within 3-5 miles and it didn't matter how smooth the ride was.\n\nWhen I was able to drive, I realized I didn't get sick and that was amazing. Now, oddly, I find I don't get car sick and I don't know why. It might be due to the meds I take (post-breast cancer stuff), I'm really not sure. It's great, but I still get nervous in case I revert. I think a lot of people don't understand how awful motion sickness is, or how wonderful it feels when you don't have it.\n\nI'm married and do most of the local driving, with and without my husband. I also do some of the long-distance driving. He's never had an issue with it, and sometimes prefers it as it gives him a chance to read or listen to music or whatever.\n\nHonestly I doubt anyone gives it a second thought if they see you in the passenger seat. If this is just old gender roles stuff -- you should get rid of it.\n\nAlso, maybe your wife doesn't want the traditional roles you do.

If we're ever sharing transport with them, I would rather he *not* drive, because his frustration as a driver makes him potentially less safe behind the wheel.

Sometimes religious counselors are not actually licensed by a licensing agency. They're \"licensed\" or have certificates from some religious entity, but not a government license. The certificates are meant to look official and convey authority but the religious entity can make up whatever standards they want. And in religious counseling, a lot of times, it turns out that they basically put the burden on the wife. Even without quoting the bible. Husband drinks too much? Oh the wife needs to ease his burden. Husband cheating? Oh yeah it was wrong to cheat but the wife needs to understand that men blah blah blah\n\nDon't get me wrong there can still be bad counselors who aren't religious and are officially licensed. But if your marriage counselor is  officially licensed you should be able to find the license number and verify it's valid pretty easy. Next time you are there, take a good look at the stuff on the wall, a state license should be displayed and it will generally have the license number or at least enough information (such as counselor's name and the issuing agency name) If it's not displayed that's a bit of a red flag and you should ask about it. And remember the issuing agency should be a government agency, not a religious school or agency. It's one thing to have those but it's another to claim or give the impression of licensure if one does not have licensure.\n\nYou should also ask the counselor to explain why they think that your wife should be made miserable of an easily remedied illness just because you are insecure.", "Great who are they licensed with?", "That\u2019s not what you said in the comments you deleted.\n\nJust because you don\u2019t like what people are saying doesn\u2019t make it not true.", "[deleted]", "Lol", "[deleted]", "This is what I\u2019m saying- I\u2019m not saying it would be over that specific thing.
