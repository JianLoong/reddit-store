She originally said she got car sick, so I went with it for a long time, even though it made me feel uncomfortable. \n\nIt has been bothering me more and more lately. Especially when we are at social events and everyone's leaving and I'm sitting in the passenger seat waving bye to everyone getting into their cars, feeling like a child.\n\nI brought it up in a marriage counseling session recently (this is more of a maintenance type thing that we've been doing for a long time), and our counselor recommended that she give me a chance driving. She wasn't happy at all but agreed to try it out. \n\nEvery time I've driven now she has been extremely bitter. She'll sit in the passenger seat stewing away in anger. One word responses, very cold. She mentioned that \"this is the one thing that I can control and now I don't have that.\" (Funny enough didn't mention car sickness at all). \n\nIt's been 5 or 6 times now that we've done this. Each time I bring it up she gets pissed off. She won't refuse, but she will be miserable. \n\nI'm not going to lie, my reasoning for wanting to drive is that I believe the husband should. It's embarrassing for me when others see me sitting in the passenger seat being driven by my wife. It's emasculating. When I started driving my daughter even asked me why I was driving, when I responded \"Daddy's drive too\" she responded with \"but you dont!\". \n\nHer reasoning is that she get's car sick (but hasn't complained about it once being in the passenger seat) and that she loses some sort of control. She has stated that she hates that our Counselor gave that suggestion.  \n\nAITA for wanting to be the driver when we go places as a family? Should I just let her drive and deal with it even though it makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit disrespected as a Husband. \n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I appreciate the opinions, however harsh they were.

Lots of people get carsick if they aren't driving. And feeling like you are about to throw up fucking sucks.

And I'm betting of your wife stopped forcing herself not to puke in the car while you were driving you would not see it as your fault and you probably wouldn't help clean it up. Of course your wife is upset about losing control, control over not feeling like shit. How lovely of you to do that to her because of your insecurity problem.", "YTA. You really need to be going to counselling on your own, because this is the most pathetic thing I've ever heard. Your ego must be both enormous and incredibly fragile.", "YTA. Also the point about her not bringing up feeling sick seems ify to me. You have already shown you don\u2019t care by forcing the switch so why should she continue to tell you?

My husband enjoys it because he can read or nap.", "Whoa, YTA.\n\nMotion sickness has nothing to do with how smoothly or not someone drives. Your eyes are telling you that you're in motion, but your inner ear gives conflicting info since you're sitting still and voila -- motion sickness.\n\nI say this as someone who has been prone to motion sickness pretty much my whole life. Thank heavens for dramamine and wrist bands. I would get sick quickly without some preventive measures, like within 3-5 miles and it didn't matter how smooth the ride was.\n\nWhen I was able to drive, I realized I didn't get sick and that was amazing. Now, oddly, I find I don't get car sick and I don't know why. It might be due to the meds I take (post-breast cancer stuff), I'm really not sure. It's great, but I still get nervous in case I revert. I think a lot of people don't understand how awful motion sickness is, or how wonderful it feels when you don't have it.\n\nI'm married and do most of the local driving, with and without my husband. I also do some of the long-distance driving. He's never had an issue with it, and sometimes prefers it as it gives him a chance to read or listen to music or whatever.\n\nHonestly I doubt anyone gives it a second thought if they see you in the passenger seat.

She is now way more comfortable in tight traffic situations, and I can sit back!", "Is this the girlfriend from a year ago?", "YTA. I get extremely motion sick when I travel. I can't even go on bouncy castles without getting sick. I always drive and my husband cheerfully sits in the passenger seat and just makes sure I'm okay.\n\nI think the only times he's driven was when I was in labour and physically couldn't, and then we had bigger things to think about than my motion sickness.", "Oh my goodness. This is all about your ego and your misogyny.   What does it matter that your wife drives.  If this is in the US, I\u2019d report the therapist for allowing misogyny to happen in the family.  \n\nYTA", "Yta because you're sexist", "If you really want to be good role models for your kids, take turns driving. \n\nESH", "YTA.... Being the passenger means more time for reddit.", "It's not that deep. No one cares if you are insecure when they see you on the passenger side. Sit in the back and pretend you have a chauffer, then you'll feel fancy.", "My fiance lost his license due to his epilepsy and was dumbfounded by how many asked if he felt embarrassed by having me drive him everywhere. He joked he'd never realised he was so secure in his manhood that it had just never occurred to him to be bothered about it", "Wow! YTA and borderline misogynistic; maybe tell your therapist WHY you really wanted to drive and watch them side with your wife really quick, be better asshole.", "YTA! Just jumping in to add that as a woman who does all the driving due to my husband childhood traumas. I don\u2019t see him as less of a man for not driving, though I do see you as one for being so obsessed with this.", "So, a year ago you were gassing up your gf's car, no kids mentioned, but now your daughter is old enough to talk?", "oh my god i would pay so much money to have someone drive me around. There's nothing I want more than to always be a passenger in a car. \n\ndon't look this gift horse in the mouth. Driving is way worse than being driven around. \n\nYTA, be grateful.", "ESH Seriously who the F\\*\\*\\* cares. I guess it would bother me too if my wife insisted on driving all the time for no reason but the fact that either one of you cares enough that they want to drive all the time is just weird.", "YTA my husband and I drive places all the time usually I'm driving. Rarely does he drive. He doesn't feel disrespected and very seldom does he ask to drive but if he does I let him. Sounds to me like your wife told you the issue. You control everything else and she wants driving to be her thing.", "NAH. My ex always wanted to drive because he liked being in control of the situation, which I feel the same way. My husband loves the fact that I drive all the time.... He always has a DD", "You\u2019re gross, sir. YTA.", "YTA such sexist nonsense! My husband and I share driving, he isn\u2019t insecure so has no issues with it (he actually prefers not driving). I\u2019ve never heard anyone comment on his masculinity because of it! What other stupidity do you force on your wife due to your backwards views and fragile ego?", "Unless there are other control issues to be dealt with.\n Have a drink or 2 or 5/6 and enjoy being taxied around by the daft bugger that volunteers for it", "YTA. The least you could do is take turns. You sound mysoginistic.", "Yta ... 1950 is calling, requesting their point of view back", "YTA. Your reason for wanting to drive is really silly. You are not less of a man for sitting in the passenger seat, and it's unfair to enforce gender roles on your wife.", "YTA. Glad you have a therapist, because dude, *YOU NEED ONE*.\n\n\"Especially when we are at social events and everyone's leaving and I'm sitting in the passenger seat waving bye to everyone getting into their cars, **feeling like a child.\"**\n\n \"**It's embarrassing for me** when others see me sitting in the passenger seat being driven by my wife. **It's emasculating.\"**\n\n\"Should I just let her drive and deal with it even though it makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit **disrespected as a Husband.**\"\n\nWhat in the deep fried misogony did I just read?

She feels controlled by you, like she doesn't have control over anything else in her life? What. The. Fuck?!?!?!\n\nDude. You have *much* bigger issues than who is driving the car, lol. Show this post to your therapist EXACTLY as you wrote it here and come tell us how they react.", "YTA. Stop being sexist. There is no excuse for this ridiculous expectation that as the man you need to drive. I drive everywhere with my hubby because I hate how he drives and I\u2019m not a nervous driver like he is. Just get over your toxic masculinity BS", "Confused as you say your wife and you have a daughter old enough to be talking but you posted a year ago about filling your girlfriends tank. So YTA for crap posting.", "Is what people think about you more important that what your wife feels?", "YTA.  \"my reasoning for wanting to drive is that I believe the husband should. It's embarrassing for me when others see me sitting in the passenger seat being driven by my wife. It's emasculating.\" Why? Do you see wives as 2nd class citizens? Whether I or my husband drives depends primarily on what vehicle we drive. My convertible, I drive, the 300 he usually drives. The truck, he always drives because getting in on the driver's side and maneuvering around the steering wheel is harder with my arthritic knees. But, if we are just going out for a drive on a sunny day with the top down, he can drive if he wants, he just doesn't get to mess up my memory settings for position of the seat and mirrors. Has to make sure he uses the correct setting. Seems that if you are emasculated by your wife driving, you didn't have much masculinity to start with.", "YTA and super sexist.", "YTA, but power to you for your honesty.", "NTA.  Rookie AITA, you didn't swap the genders.  If you had you would've gotten overwhelming NTA.    You already figured out that the whole \"car sickness\" thing was a lie, this was about control, this was about having her way, and now she's sour about it.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, you're the husband, so you wanting to drive occasionally (your own kid didn't think you could drive FFS) is an evil patriarchal power-grab designed to destroy your wife's autonomy.    \n\n\nThat's how this sub works.", "\"I'm not going to lie, my reasoning for wanting to drive is that I believe the husband should.\"\n\nYou're joking, right.   YTA for this alone although you're both acting like children about it.\n\nHere's a crazy idea: alternate who gets to drive.  Or start communicating like adults.", "Take turns!", "YTA get over your ego. You are fragile. You are sexist assuming a man should drive around his wife. I feel sad that she has no control in her own life other than driving.", "YTA. For your sexism and outdated gender role nonsense. \u201cYou feel like a child\u201d? Seriously? I can\u2019t understand how someone would be so insecure about not driving the car.", "YTA. My wife gets carsick when others drive, so guess what? I let her drive.\n\nEnjoy the divorce!", "YTA. This whole thing is about toxic masculinity and how sad it is that you don't have any sort of internal self-worth. \n\nIt *should* be about why your wife thinks driving is her only source of control. What are you doing to her??", "YTA. And it\u2019s super weird that you think being the passenger is emasculating. Deal with your issues dude.", " NTA women are not safe drivers. Would you rather a car sick wife or a dead family?", "I get very car sick. I get sick on planes, boats, trains, roller coasters, 4D amusement park rides and sometimes even watching my husband play video games. \n\nMy in laws are as traditional as the come and yet guess who is driving their behemoth of a truck whenever we go out together? Yep it\u2019s me the tiny daughter in law who needs a damn stool just to get into the car because it\u2019s so far off the ground. Why? So I won\u2019t get sick! \n\nAlso I find it telling that your daughter was surprised at you driving. Have you never taken your kid anywhere on your own without your wife???", "YTA.   \n\n\nSharing the experience isn't AH behaviour, but the reasoning that it's \"emasculating\" sure as shit is, and I'd argue that your counsellor is somewhat of an AH if that was their way of dealing with it knowing that fact, instead of helping to deal with the ridiculous gender roles instead.", "ESH.\n\nYou especially for apparently having such a fragile ego that you can't handle someone else driving.\n\nHer for agreeing to let you drive sometimes and then being passive-aggressive when she lets you drive.\n\nThe comment about this being the one thing she controls makes me wonder if there's an underlying issue here.", "Drive yourself, by yourself, for yourself in your lonesome. \nShe needs to do the same for her own HEALTH and Sanity. \n\nYour child can decide who to drive with.
