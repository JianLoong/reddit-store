She originally said she got car sick, so I went with it for a long time, even though it made me feel uncomfortable. \n\nIt has been bothering me more and more lately. Especially when we are at social events and everyone's leaving and I'm sitting in the passenger seat waving bye to everyone getting into their cars, feeling like a child.\n\nI brought it up in a marriage counseling session recently (this is more of a maintenance type thing that we've been doing for a long time), and our counselor recommended that she give me a chance driving. She wasn't happy at all but agreed to try it out. \n\nEvery time I've driven now she has been extremely bitter. She'll sit in the passenger seat stewing away in anger. One word responses, very cold. She mentioned that \"this is the one thing that I can control and now I don't have that.\" (Funny enough didn't mention car sickness at all). \n\nIt's been 5 or 6 times now that we've done this. Each time I bring it up she gets pissed off. She won't refuse, but she will be miserable. \n\nI'm not going to lie, my reasoning for wanting to drive is that I believe the husband should. It's embarrassing for me when others see me sitting in the passenger seat being driven by my wife. It's emasculating. When I started driving my daughter even asked me why I was driving, when I responded \"Daddy's drive too\" she responded with \"but you dont!\". \n\nHer reasoning is that she get's car sick (but hasn't complained about it once being in the passenger seat) and that she loses some sort of control. She has stated that she hates that our Counselor gave that suggestion.  \n\nAITA for wanting to be the driver when we go places as a family? Should I just let her drive and deal with it even though it makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit disrespected as a Husband. \n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I appreciate the opinions, however harsh they were.

Lots of people get carsick if they aren't driving. And feeling like you are about to throw up fucking sucks.

And I'm betting of your wife stopped forcing herself not to puke in the car while you were driving you would not see it as your fault and you probably wouldn't help clean it up. Of course your wife is upset about losing control, control over not feeling like shit. How lovely of you to do that to her because of your insecurity problem.", "YTA. You really need to be going to counselling on your own, because this is the most pathetic thing I've ever heard. Your ego must be both enormous and incredibly fragile.", "YTA. Also the point about her not bringing up feeling sick seems ify to me. You have already shown you don\u2019t care by forcing the switch so why should she continue to tell you?

My husband enjoys it because he can read or nap.", "Whoa, YTA.\n\nMotion sickness has nothing to do with how smoothly or not someone drives. Your eyes are telling you that you're in motion, but your inner ear gives conflicting info since you're sitting still and voila -- motion sickness.\n\nI say this as someone who has been prone to motion sickness pretty much my whole life. Thank heavens for dramamine and wrist bands. I would get sick quickly without some preventive measures, like within 3-5 miles and it didn't matter how smooth the ride was.\n\nWhen I was able to drive, I realized I didn't get sick and that was amazing. Now, oddly, I find I don't get car sick and I don't know why. It might be due to the meds I take (post-breast cancer stuff), I'm really not sure. It's great, but I still get nervous in case I revert. I think a lot of people don't understand how awful motion sickness is, or how wonderful it feels when you don't have it.\n\nI'm married and do most of the local driving, with and without my husband. I also do some of the long-distance driving. He's never had an issue with it, and sometimes prefers it as it gives him a chance to read or listen to music or whatever.\n\nHonestly I doubt anyone gives it a second thought if they see you in the passenger seat.

'Cause you know, nothing screams \"marriage material\" like a dude who disregards the laws of the road and doesn't give a crap about driving safely /s", "\ud83d\ude2c I also get motion sick (passenger seat is often okay) but I prefer to drive because I'm a very defensive driver. But I've also had friends amd family members that I will NEVER be a passenger with again because their style of driving makes me immediately motion sick, makes me feel like I'm going to die at any moment with how reckless they are, or both. (A major one is the people who always are pressing either the gas or the brake and never just coast. This style of driving WILL make me puke.)\n\nI was wondering recently how often this might be a point that actually makes couples break up. Drivers where I live tend to exist on a spectrum from awful to insane, and I often see people pull shenanigans that are like, if I was their SO in the car with them and they did shit like that, I'd break up with them. Just immediately. Like some types of drivers just seem to display a flagrant disregard for the lives of other drivers and their own passengers. I'd never be able to marry someone who'd give me that kind of anxiety every time they drove.", "Maybe he has both?  I doubt it\u2026 unless the gf is unknown to the wife?  Again, I doubt it, but the side gf thing would be interesting!", "True, my ex was a bit of a sexist prick and apparently I overreacted by dumping his ass.", "I was thinking the same thing. Don't believe that I get carsick? Okay....BLARF", "I\u2019m a woman ( despite my screen name) and we generally drive our own cars so depending on which date we take, either of use might drive. It\u2019s wild. This is yet another thread that makes me thank my husband for not being a dick", "He also says she gives short, terse answers - that is really common for people feeling motion sickness. I only get it occasionally, but when I do I hold myself very rigid to keep from throwing up.\n\nAlso, everyone I know who gets bad motion sickness benefits from being in control of the car.\n\nThat being said, her comment about losing control could also mean that she feels that she's having to constantly cater to her husband's fragile ego - even to the point of having to be ill in the car because his balls will drop off if she keeps driving or something.", "Being in control of the vehicle does help reduce car sickness though.", "Heaven forbid the daughter drives, the wife sits in the front seat and OP has to sit in the back \u201clike a child\u201d.", "My thoughts too. So does he consider his wife a child? Or inferior? Or disrespected? Wtf OP", "Yeah it\u2019s natural and normal to infantilize grown women in reference to their male partners, obviously! Gotta respect the MEN", "I saw that, but let it slide because he doesn't *always* capitalize it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt.", "I have a friend like that who is the worst freaking driver. He thinks he's great though. I don't get it.", "My boyfriend has lived in our city for like 15 years and still doesn't know where he is going 90% of the time and he drives like an old person who is blind, therefore I drive most of the time", "My spouse and I did couples therapy for a year+ before we got married to make sure we worked out any big decisions that might come up (where we wanted to live, career goals, children). It's possible they have been in therapy for a long time but only married this year. \n\nMy spouse and I still do quarterly therapy. I highly recommend it as a form of proactive relationship maintenance (instead of trying to bring in a therapist when things are already pretty bad like many people do).", "We only have one car because we both work a walking distance from our house. It\u2019s such a non issue.", "Short, terse comments could also be an effort not to have a panic attack if the issue is actually anxiety.", "Inferior for sure.  She belongs in the kitchen not behind the wheel. Women are terrible drivers.  /s  \n\nYTA - my wife gets carsick if anyone drives besides her, and I happen to fall asleep when taking road trips if I'm not behind the wheel.  So  I get a little nap when we're going on vacation and she gets to not hang her head out the window and vomit.  It really is a win for everyone.  You sound like a controlling asshole, BTW.", "And you both get to enjoy knowing each other is comfortable!", "Personally, I love a man that\u2019ll offer to drive, so I understand where you\u2019re coming from. But there are times where I want to drive too, I love feeling the wind on my face as I view the road. Seeing the different angles of different seats, and what not. \n\nBut, when it comes down to it, maybe the issue is deeper than who gets to drive and who doesn\u2019t. You should have a calm sit down with your wife, and talk about things judgement free. You already know how she feels, but why does she feel that way? Why does it emasculate you when she drives? \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an a-hole, I do think you were a little insensitive about her wants and needs. That can be worked on, if it\u2019s something you\u2019re willing to compromise over.", "NTA. If she hasn\u2019t complained about being sick, it\u2019s about control. Keep driving.", "NTA. So she's allowed to drive because she has control issues but you're never allowed to because she gets to rule the roost? No. Put your foot down and drive if you want to. She controls plenty. Including your balls in her purse.", "I\u2019m questioning the therapist\u2019s credibility", "And \u201ccontrol\u201d here might not be code for something bigger; it may literally be that she doesn\u2019t get car sickness when she\u2019s in control of the car. \n\nI\u2019ve been known to get pretty carsick, but *me* slamming on the breaks just doesn\u2019t have the same effect as when some when else does it. And being the driver also gives you more control of your environment like the AC level and noise *(\u201cstop screaming or I\u2019m pulling this vehicle over!\u201d)*", "Car sick is horrible. You're freezing on the outside, but boiling on the inside. Your skin is weirdly clammy. Every time the car turns or breaks the feeling amplifies with a crashing wave of nausea.", "Obviously that\u2019s because if they don\u2019t drive they lose their manhood. So they have to drive extra hard.", "There's definitely a huge difference in what it feels like when you're driving vs when you're a passenger", "Agreed.  I get car sick very easily.  I drive whenever possible.  i\u2019m okay most of the time if my hubby drives, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t brake very smoothly and I start to get nauseous.", "I am, too.", "I just commented something very similar! Twins in our motion sickness and what the driver was doing wrong.\n\nEta the relationship didn\u2019t end bc that, I just drove from then on.", "You mean to tell me all those sick as fuck burnouts don\u2019t make the ladies want to drop their panties for me?!?!?!?  I\u2019ve been lied too. \ud83d\ude2d\n\n/s if anyone couldn\u2019t tell", "My ex is such a bad driver. I was literally throwing up on a road trip bc of his inability to keep a steady speed. After that, I drove everywhere.", "They have a daughter old enough to notice/ ask why he\u2019s driving; they\u2019ve been together more than a year or two.", "I feel like I'm anal retentive because if I ever go anywhere with my friend, I insist on driving because his driving makes me feel so sick. He also really likes to tailgate and and told me that he thinks that slamming on the brakes is better for the brakes and tires than gradually slowing down, so that's how he drives. He will get right up behind people and slam on the brakes at the last minute and it feels like we are almost going to hit basically everyone.", "Omg I hate that! Like, you see that\u2019s a red light up ahead, right?! Ease the brakes! And it\u2019s a little funny that I\u2019m the more defensive driver, when I\u2019m with literally anyone else they drive."]}
