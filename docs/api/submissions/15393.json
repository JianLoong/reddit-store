I get it, we like to be there for our kids firsts,but your MIL isn't getting any younger and your available time for your daughter is getting less with school coming up etc. There may never been a perfect time that matches everyone's schedule and it would be a shame for your daughter to miss out. I hate this refuse to give permission nonsense too. You don't have exclusive rights on what your daughter can and cannot do. Presumably her dad is a grown adult who is capable of looking after her without you? Yes you can say you will be disappointed if you don't get to go,but you have no right to stop the whole thing from happening", "NTA. I doubt she didn't book it purposefully to screw you over.

If husband desperately wants to go, then he may go by himself. I think he should go and stay there indefinitely from the comments OP is giving too.", "NTA\n\nSince nobody else is working in this situation apart from you then you should pick the date, however you need time off and work shouldn't completely dictate when it is, pick a date that's 'quiet' season and book it.

Giving them a free pass makes YTA to yourself and your daughter.\n\nAs to the trip itself, would the timing change anything? If with this much advance notice, your employers are balking, would it really be different at a different time of year?  I suspect not. And thus I suspect part of the problem with this being rescheduled multiple times - and you not getting to pick the date in advance - is because NO DATE is a good date for you.\n\nIf that's true, then think about what you are saying...  You can't offer another better date...  You can't commit to going really at any time...  But due to your [works] inflexibility - you are willing to block your daughter and partner from being able to go see their family.  That sounds like YTA... Especially with grandma getting up in years. \n\nAgain, would be completely different if you could say something like \"I can't make July work, can we reschedule to sometime in September\" (or pick your month).  As you said, if the dates can be changed, then everyone wins. But you shouldn't expect you family to put their life on indefinite hold in the hope that \"one day\" you'll eventually get the time off.\n\nAnd I'd add, if you are that irreplaceable at your job, they should be more than willing to keep you as a happy employee - and grant you the time off.
