You and I both know how hard it is to get time off, but you need to decide if your family trip is more important than your job. \n\nMIL is AH for buying the timeshare without consulting with you as well tho. \n\nTake the time off and go with your family. The restaurant will survive.", "\u201crefusing to allow\u201d\n\nYTA for this alone. My husband would not dare say those words to me. He knows that would be a very bad idea. And the same goes for me. I would never say that.", "I\u2019m going with a reluctant YWBTA. You\u2019ve been trying to schedule this for years. You\u2019ve requested time off well in advanced. If you allow your employer to screw not only you but your partner and child over, that\u2019s pretty shitty. You are putting your job over your family. How long do you think they\u2019ll put up with that before they really start resenting you?", "YWBTA. Disappointment is one thing, but grandma isn\u2019t getting any younger and your daughter is old enough to have beautiful memories of this trip. Don\u2019t be selfish. Either get the time off and go with, or lovingly send them off.", "YWBTA. I get it, we like to be there for our kids firsts,but your MIL isn't getting any younger and your available time for your daughter is getting less with school coming up etc. There may never been a perfect time that matches everyone's schedule and it would be a shame for your daughter to miss out. I hate this refuse to give permission nonsense too. You don't have exclusive rights on what your daughter can and cannot do. Presumably her dad is a grown adult who is capable of looking after her without you? Yes you can say you will be disappointed if you don't get to go,but you have no right to stop the whole thing from happening", "NTA. I doubt she didn't book it purposefully to screw you over. It's rude to book anything without consulting all parties, especially the lodging. She is not the mother, nor the wife in this situation and should be respectful enough to not react angrily when you three plan the dates for your own vacation with no consideration for her.\n\nIt's only fair. I wish you luck, just reading this is giving me a headache. I feel your pain and hope you get in some well deserved rest in beautiful PR with your fam once you get that break.", "NTA this is not acceptable.\n\nYour family is your nuclear family, meaning partner and daughter. Same goes for your partner. He doesn\u2019t get to let mommy plan trips for your family and shrug his shoulders about it.\n\nHe needs to create healthy boundaries with his mother and he needs to enforce them.\n\nWhat you 100% should do, for damage control, is either suck it up and make this trip work OR turn it down and simultaneously plan a trip that works for your family. You do need to stop dragging your feet on this and get it over with. But you should do it on your terms. And talk to your partner about how he needs to be a real partner to you.", "I'm surprised at all these comments. My small child isn't leaving the state/country/whatever without me, period. NTA.", "NTA. Travel plans should only be made if all parties are available.", "I N F O is this his extended family or yours?    \n   \nEdit: I'd say YTA tbh. Mainly for the \"refusing to allow\" part. If your husband hasn't seen his family for as long as you say, and you actively refuse to let your daughter go on the trip because you can't join, that speaks more to problems with the dynamics with your husband and in-laws. A trip that's been scheduled and re-scheduled and that will be great memories for your daughter isn't the hill to die on.", "NTA, but be prepared for his mother to push back hard.", "Gonna say NTA\n\nThis is a 4 year old. Going without a parent when both are together is not exactly normal. Furthermore, MIL needs to not be booking vacations without checking with mom first. Just not cool and feels very much like a control move. I get this is visiting family, but OP is actually her daughter and partner's family, too.... be weird if she's not there at a family event \n\nEdit: Double NTA with the clarification in the comments OP is actually the only working parent. Yeah, that needs to go around OP's schedule a bit then. Busy season is when the most money is made, even if OP is able to get the time off. Saying \"OK, stay home to pay for everything while we go on vacation\" would be something else", "YTA - Your daughter is about to start school, when is this trip supposed to happen if she's in school during the year and your job's busy season is during the summer? You've given plenty of notice to your job, have a sit down with your boss and get that time off. If you are so valuable that they can't allow you some time off, then they sure as hell can't afford to lose you altogether should you choose to quit over this. If you are not willing to stand up for yourself at work, then wish you daughter and her father a safe trip.", "NTA. His mother doesn't get to unilaterally decide dates and then declare that they're immovable. It should be a decision you're involved in and a trip you go on. There is no reason for you to be excluded from this, that's ridiculous. Schedule the trip at a non-busy time that works for you.", "YWNBTA for asking your partner to make it a family trip.  Maybe you can go for at least part of the trip?\n\nAlso, is it really just a coincidence that your \"MIL\" picked a date that is very unlikely to work for you?", "YWBTA - you have given your job plenty of heads up, he hasn\u2019t seen his family in 10 years and you have been putting this trip off for far too long. If you decide you can\u2019t go, you can\u2019t deny him and your daughter the opportunity. They can\u2019t just keep waiting on it being convenient for you. Also, time shares are incredibly hard to both book and rebook since it\u2019s shared with tons of people. It\u2019s a nightmare and IMO a waste of money but that age bracket loves to have a time share!", "Yta", "YTA. If being off one or two weeks during the summer months disrupts the business that much, backup plans should already be in place. If you can\u2019t go, don\u2019t stop them. You can plan another visit for a time for you all when you are not going to cause the business to fail (apparently it will fail if you request time off months in advance).", "YTA. Sorry, not trying to heap guilt on you by any means, as you\u2019re in a lousy situation. However, life keeps moving, and in the not-so-distant future, your MIL may not be as healthy and able to travel as she is today. \n\nWe split some vacations early in our careers for lack of vacation time, and so did most of our friends (husband didn\u2019t go to Disney, and I stayed home for several other trips). Good luck, OP. Hoping your PTO comes through!", "YWBTA if you didn't go with them!  The stars aligned, opportunity is there... If your job doesn't let you take off...\n\nGO ANYWAY!   You've provided ample notice, if they refuse the time off call out sick everyday until they fire you.\nYou'll find better place to work when you get back!", "YWWBTA if you stop them from visiting their family. You can decide whether you go or not, but you cannot force them not to go. \n\nYou should ask the higher up to cover for you. They have time to prepare already.", "YWBTA. Your partner has every right to take his child to see his family and country, with or without you. You don't have sole decision making rights here. Of course it would be lovely for you all to go together but your partner hasn't been back in 10 years, so if you can't get time off, you don't get to \"refuse to let\" them go.", " Straight lmao at everyone YTA comments. \n\nAs someone who has a boss mom, who would almost never have time for us kiddos because she was busting her ass off, NTA. \n\nVery similar situation for me as a child. Till this day my mother regrets not being to go on my and my sisters first time to Mexico trip. And I will be brutally honest I was 4 too. I wanted my mom and didn\u2019t know how to express it properly at that age. I had my dad and his family, but you can\u2019t replace a mom.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful gift, but your mother in law is being deliberate about her actions. Who tf books a timeshare without contacting the others first?", "Yeah fam it\u2019s not all about you. YWBTA if you didn\u2019t try to get the time off and go, if you can\u2019t don\u2019t let your family suffer because of it. Lowkey your MIL didn\u2019t want you to go lol but don\u2019t have your daughter and husband miss out on their culture and family. Bruh your husband hasn\u2019t there in 10 YEARS! \n\nYou sound like the person who has been putting the trip off because of your schedule, maybe your MIL just took the initiative of booking it and got tired of waiting for you", "NTA, dunno what\u2019s wrong with you people. If husband desperately wants to go, then he may go by himself. I think he should go and stay there indefinitely from the comments OP is giving too.", "NTA\n\nSince nobody else is working in this situation apart from you then you should pick the date, however you need time off and work shouldn't completely dictate when it is, pick a date that's 'quiet' season and book it. MIL is probably tired of waiting and that's why she's done it, she can travel on her own if she really needs to go (and if able too!).\nSpeak to work, get some time off and book it!! \nI certainly wouldn't let my children leave the country on a holiday without me when it can be booked another time.", "NTA   I wouldn't let my 4 year old daughter travel to another country without me.  No way!  No how!  They should have considered whether you'd be able to go at that time before booking.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know we are actively looking and the Director of Ops and GM are interviewing candidates but we both know how hard it is to find good managers", "I mean, while I agree with the judgement and the sentiment about not putting up with shitty employers, not everybody can afford to leave a job because they weren't given vacation time. I'm surprised at how many people are suggesting this on the thread.", "I am the sole financial provider at this time.

You\u2019re a good manager no? Tell your boss that their reluctance to approve this time off makes you feel uncomfortable and let them sit with that. Try not to fill the silence. It\u2019s on them to figure this out.\n\nI understand dealing with time off while working at a restaurant is difficult but the truth is the place would run regardless of whether you were there or not. They\u2019re just trying to make it easier on themselves. Fwiw this is a complicated anxiety inducing situation with no correct answer. Goodluck!", "Then the director of ops and GM can cover for you. Decide what's more important. The job, or the family. It is YOUR decision. It might pis people off, but you have the power to do whatever you want.", "Question: would you take your toddler to visit your family without your husband if he couldnt go? Be honest.", "I'm inclined for YTA...\n\nUnless partner is full time SAHD, disabled, or otherwise unable to work, they should be helping to support the family. Giving them a free pass makes YTA to yourself and your daughter.\n\nAs to the trip itself, would the timing change anything? If with this much advance notice, your employers are balking, would it really be different at a different time of year?  I suspect not. And thus I suspect part of the problem with this being rescheduled multiple times - and you not getting to pick the date in advance - is because NO DATE is a good date for you.\n\nIf that's true, then think about what you are saying...  You can't offer another better date...  You can't commit to going really at any time...  But due to your [works] inflexibility - you are willing to block your daughter and partner from being able to go see their family.  That sounds like YTA... Especially with grandma getting up in years. \n\nAgain, would be completely different if you could say something like \"I can't make July work, can we reschedule to sometime in September\" (or pick your month).  As you said, if the dates can be changed, then everyone wins. But you shouldn't expect you family to put their life on indefinite hold in the hope that \"one day\" you'll eventually get the time off.\n\nAnd I'd add, if you are that irreplaceable at your job, they should be more than willing to keep you as a happy employee - and grant you the time off. And if they aren't, perhaps it's time you explored other employers who would treat you better. You deserve more.", "You realize one of the parents is going on the trip as well.", "INFO: It sounds like your family have gotten plenty of opportunities to see her. Is it his family in Puerto Rico? If so have much has his side other than MIL seen her?", "You\u2019ve been \u201cdiscussing\u201d this trip for more than 4 years?  Sounds more like you\u2019ve been \u201crefusing to allow\u201d your husband see his family for a decade unless they come visit.  \n\nTrain a replacement to take over for a week and stop trying to control everything.  You literally have 4 months, that is ample time.", "It is OP's decision, and to leave her job because she couldn't get time off is such a ridiculous statement. OP is the sole financial provider, without her job they'd have diddly squat.", "OP said that her daughter has been with family in another state without both parents, so she most definitely would go without her husband if she is allowing her to go to another state without either of them.", "The business is actively looking for management staff, can they afford to lose another over something as simple as a few days off?", "Potentially, yes. It depends how shitty the employers are and whether they're willing to play chicken to try and get their way."]}
