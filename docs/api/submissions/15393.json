The restaurant will survive.", "\u201crefusing to allow\u201d\n\nYTA for this alone. My husband would not dare say those words to me. He knows that would be a very bad idea. And the same goes for me.

If you allow your employer to screw not only you but your partner and child over, that\u2019s pretty shitty. You are putting your job over your family.

Disappointment is one thing, but grandma isn\u2019t getting any younger and your daughter is old enough to have beautiful memories of this trip. Don\u2019t be selfish. Either get the time off and go with, or lovingly send them off.", "YWBTA. I get it, we like to be there for our kids firsts,but your MIL isn't getting any younger and your available time for your daughter is getting less with school coming up etc. There may never been a perfect time that matches everyone's schedule and it would be a shame for your daughter to miss out. I hate this refuse to give permission nonsense too. You don't have exclusive rights on what your daughter can and cannot do. Presumably her dad is a grown adult who is capable of looking after her without you? Yes you can say you will be disappointed if you don't get to go,but you have no right to stop the whole thing from happening", "NTA. I doubt she didn't book it purposefully to screw you over. It's rude to book anything without consulting all parties, especially the lodging.

You've given plenty of notice to your job, have a sit down with your boss and get that time off. If you are so valuable that they can't allow you some time off, then they sure as hell can't afford to lose you altogether should you choose to quit over this. If you are not willing to stand up for yourself at work, then wish you daughter and her father a safe trip.", "NTA. His mother doesn't get to unilaterally decide dates and then declare that they're immovable. It should be a decision you're involved in and a trip you go on.

Good luck, OP. Hoping your PTO comes through!", "YWBTA if you didn't go with them!  The stars aligned, opportunity is there... If your job doesn't let you take off...\n\nGO ANYWAY!

Your partner has every right to take his child to see his family and country, with or without you. You don't have sole decision making rights here. Of course it would be lovely for you all to go together but your partner hasn't been back in 10 years, so if you can't get time off, you don't get to \"refuse to let\" them go.", " Straight lmao at everyone YTA comments. \n\nAs someone who has a boss mom, who would almost never have time for us kiddos because she was busting her ass off, NTA. \n\nVery similar situation for me as a child.

I wanted my mom and didn\u2019t know how to express it properly at that age. I had my dad and his family, but you can\u2019t replace a mom.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful gift, but your mother in law is being deliberate about her actions.

If husband desperately wants to go, then he may go by himself. I think he should go and stay there indefinitely from the comments OP is giving too.", "NTA\n\nSince nobody else is working in this situation apart from you then you should pick the date, however you need time off and work shouldn't completely dictate when it is, pick a date that's 'quiet' season and book it.

Be honest.", "I'm inclined for YTA...\n\nUnless partner is full time SAHD, disabled, or otherwise unable to work, they should be helping to support the family. Giving them a free pass makes YTA to yourself and your daughter.\n\nAs to the trip itself, would the timing change anything? If with this much advance notice, your employers are balking, would it really be different at a different time of year?  I suspect not. And thus I suspect part of the problem with this being rescheduled multiple times - and you not getting to pick the date in advance - is because NO DATE is a good date for you.\n\nIf that's true, then think about what you are saying...  You can't offer another better date...  You can't commit to going really at any time...  But due to your [works] inflexibility - you are willing to block your daughter and partner from being able to go see their family.  That sounds like YTA... Especially with grandma getting up in years. \n\nAgain, would be completely different if you could say something like \"I can't make July work, can we reschedule to sometime in September\" (or pick your month).  As you said, if the dates can be changed, then everyone wins. But you shouldn't expect you family to put their life on indefinite hold in the hope that \"one day\" you'll eventually get the time off.\n\nAnd I'd add, if you are that irreplaceable at your job, they should be more than willing to keep you as a happy employee - and grant you the time off. And if they aren't, perhaps it's time you explored other employers who would treat you better. You deserve more.", "You realize one of the parents is going on the trip as well.", "INFO: It sounds like your family have gotten plenty of opportunities to see her. Is it his family in Puerto Rico?

But then MIL steps in with funding, and because it's her money, her decision, doesn't talk to you about the timing of the trip. Did she talk to your husband? Did he point out it would be better at a different time? Next question, is your husband's employment situation likely to improve before this trip?
