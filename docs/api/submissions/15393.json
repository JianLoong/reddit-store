The restaurant will survive.\n\nETA: This comment is getting a lot more traction than I expected, so I want to elaborate a bit and address some of the issues being mentioned in replies. \n\nThere are staffing agencies and temp employers that could easily fill OPs shoes for a week, or, if it's really that hard to find staff, OP should have no issues finding another job that allows them to put their family first. The trip is in July they have plenty of time to make arrangements.\n\nIt sounds like either OPs management is manipulating them into taking time off when it's convenient for the business, or, OP is using the job as an excuse to manipulate the family into taking the vacation when it's convenient for them.", "\u201crefusing to allow\u201d\n\nYTA for this alone.

You\u2019ve been trying to schedule this for years. You\u2019ve requested time off well in advanced. If you allow your employer to screw not only you but your partner and child over, that\u2019s pretty shitty. You are putting your job over your family. How long do you think they\u2019ll put up with that before they really start resenting you?", "YWBTA. Disappointment is one thing, but grandma isn\u2019t getting any younger and your daughter is old enough to have beautiful memories of this trip. Don\u2019t be selfish. Either get the time off and go with, or lovingly send them off.", "YWBTA. I get it, we like to be there for our kids firsts,but your MIL isn't getting any younger and your available time for your daughter is getting less with school coming up etc. There may never been a perfect time that matches everyone's schedule and it would be a shame for your daughter to miss out. I hate this refuse to give permission nonsense too. You don't have exclusive rights on what your daughter can and cannot do. Presumably her dad is a grown adult who is capable of looking after her without you? Yes you can say you will be disappointed if you don't get to go,but you have no right to stop the whole thing from happening", "NTA. I doubt she didn't book it purposefully to screw you over.

Same goes for your partner. He doesn\u2019t get to let mommy plan trips for your family and shrug his shoulders about it.\n\nHe needs to create healthy boundaries with his mother and he needs to enforce them.\n\nWhat you 100% should do, for damage control, is either suck it up and make this trip work OR turn it down and simultaneously plan a trip that works for your family.

Mainly for the \"refusing to allow\" part. If your husband hasn't seen his family for as long as you say, and you actively refuse to let your daughter go on the trip because you can't join, that speaks more to problems with the dynamics with your husband and in-laws.

Going without a parent when both are together is not exactly normal. Furthermore, MIL needs to not be booking vacations without checking with mom first.

Yeah, that needs to go around OP's schedule a bit then. Busy season is when the most money is made, even if OP is able to get the time off.

You've given plenty of notice to your job, have a sit down with your boss and get that time off. If you are so valuable that they can't allow you some time off, then they sure as hell can't afford to lose you altogether should you choose to quit over this. If you are not willing to stand up for yourself at work, then wish you daughter and her father a safe trip.", "NTA. His mother doesn't get to unilaterally decide dates and then declare that they're immovable. It should be a decision you're involved in and a trip you go on.

If you decide you can\u2019t go, you can\u2019t deny him and your daughter the opportunity. They can\u2019t just keep waiting on it being convenient for you.

Good luck, OP. Hoping your PTO comes through!", "YWBTA if you didn't go with them!  The stars aligned, opportunity is there... If your job doesn't let you take off...\n\nGO ANYWAY!

Your partner has every right to take his child to see his family and country, with or without you. You don't have sole decision making rights here. Of course it would be lovely for you all to go together but your partner hasn't been back in 10 years, so if you can't get time off, you don't get to \"refuse to let\" them go.", " Straight lmao at everyone YTA comments. \n\nAs someone who has a boss mom, who would almost never have time for us kiddos because she was busting her ass off, NTA. \n\nVery similar situation for me as a child. Till this day my mother regrets not being to go on my and my sisters first time to Mexico trip. And I will be brutally honest I was 4 too. I wanted my mom and didn\u2019t know how to express it properly at that age. I had my dad and his family, but you can\u2019t replace a mom.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful gift, but your mother in law is being deliberate about her actions.

Bruh your husband hasn\u2019t there in 10 YEARS! \n\nYou sound like the person who has been putting the trip off because of your schedule, maybe your MIL just took the initiative of booking it and got tired of waiting for you", "NTA, dunno what\u2019s wrong with you people. If husband desperately wants to go, then he may go by himself. I think he should go and stay there indefinitely from the comments OP is giving too.", "NTA\n\nSince nobody else is working in this situation apart from you then you should pick the date, however you need time off and work shouldn't completely dictate when it is, pick a date that's 'quiet' season and book it. MIL is probably tired of waiting and that's why she's done it, she can travel on her own if she really needs to go (and if able too!).\nSpeak to work, get some time off and book it!! \nI certainly wouldn't let my children leave the country on a holiday without me when it can be booked another time.", "NTA   I wouldn't let my 4 year old daughter travel to another country (or US Territory apart from the continental US) without me.

Giving them a free pass makes YTA to yourself and your daughter.\n\nAs to the trip itself, would the timing change anything? If with this much advance notice, your employers are balking, would it really be different at a different time of year?  I suspect not. And thus I suspect part of the problem with this being rescheduled multiple times - and you not getting to pick the date in advance - is because NO DATE is a good date for you.\n\nIf that's true, then think about what you are saying...  You can't offer another better date...  You can't commit to going really at any time...  But due to your [works] inflexibility - you are willing to block your daughter and partner from being able to go see their family.  That sounds like YTA... Especially with grandma getting up in years. \n\nAgain, would be completely different if you could say something like \"I can't make July work, can we reschedule to sometime in September\" (or pick your month).  As you said, if the dates can be changed, then everyone wins. But you shouldn't expect you family to put their life on indefinite hold in the hope that \"one day\" you'll eventually get the time off.\n\nAnd I'd add, if you are that irreplaceable at your job, they should be more than willing to keep you as a happy employee - and grant you the time off.

Other than that, TSA, CBP, or the airlines never gave us a second look.", "**Not for domestic travel.** I don't know why you're digging your heels in on this. It's not TSA/airline policy. And it isn't law. Other than some possibly overzealous TSA agents, the *most* you would be asked for is a copy of the child's birth certificate to prove your relationship. I spent years advising passengers of this information. \n\nWhen flying domestically with your own child, **it is not required to have a consent form to pass through TSA or get on a plane.** Can you get in trouble after the fact? *Absolutely*. But that's after the other parent takes the issue to court. \n\nIf he takes his daughter to the airport, they will check his ID, maybe ask to see her birth certificate, and then let him through.", "No, you do not. I have flown with all of my children w/o their other parent present, domestically & internationally, and they never ask if the other parent is present.

MIL is taking control away from the parents here.  This should have been a consultation, not a MIL-decision to make.  Does MIL do things like this about other plans that include you and your partner and child?  Because if MIL's putting herself in control over you three as a family, you all have a problem that needs worked on, and possibly therapy for your partner.\n\n*I am a restaurant manager at a very popular restaurant in my city with a large patio in a high-traffic area and July is the middle of our busy season.*\n\nMIL should have asked you what would be a good time to plan to go, so you could say \"Month is our slow time, let's do that.\" \n\n*She and I have a strenuous relationship at best that often leaves me as the \u201coutsider\u201d in the home.* \n\n Huge red flag here.  For this reason alone, I would not want my kid going to visit people I don't know, without me there to make the decisions for my child, and make sure my child is properly cared for.  Too many things can happen, traveling, that need both parents.  MIL should not be standing in as the third parent, when she fails to respect one of the actual parents.  \n\nOP, seriously, the more important money expense would be moving out, or moving MIL out of your home.  Seeing extended relatives is great, but if you are being treated this way in your home, on a daily basis, that's a bigger problem.

If you can't let your spouse even take your child on a short trip to \"another state/whatever\" maybe you should assess your own feelings about their competency as a parent or your own tendency toward an anxiety disorder.", "No it was a rollover that can be used any week fri-fri/sat-sat/sun-sun", "What is it about the prospect of equal relationships that frightens you?", "Puerto Rico is not a \u201cforeign country\u201d for US citizens. It\u2019s part of the US.  No passport or visa necessary.", "Why should the grandma have more rights to the trip than the mother?", "Where does it say she wants to be in charge of everyone? She wants to go on the trip with her husband and daughter and MIL is being spiteful on purpose.", "Many women (and I\u2019m a woman) are sexist and think the father can\u2019t care for their own child.", "We haven't done this with our 3 YO yet. But I already told my partner I'm 100% fine with him taking our son on trips without me if he wants to.\n\nI'm currently pregnant too so I don't want to do anything anyway \ud83d\ude02 but the fact stands that if my partner can give my child an experience he deserves I want that for him more than I expect to be there so they have to miss out. It just seems unfair to me. \n\nWork is not the priority if you can't make it work with at least 2 years. The family obviously want to see the daughter before she grows up completely too. And I bet she really wants to go as well. \n\nMy partner is capable of caring for our child and ensuring they are safe. That's why we have children together.", "But were there only certain weeks still available?  My SIL and her (soon to be ex) husband had a pricy timeshare but it was \"first come first serve\" and some weeks would be taken immediately.", "\"refused to let\"", "Why doesn't her partner (not her MIL) sit down with her and work out a date that's not in the busy season?", "It\u2019s not so much that both parents need to sign off for an international trip, it\u2019s that the kid can\u2019t get a passport without either both parents being there during the application process, or you get a form notarized for the absent parent. I don\u2019t know how it works if the parent is otherwise unavailable (jail, dead, overseas, etc) but it\u2019s probably a giant pain.", "Depending on where they are in the US, Puerto Rico can be quite a long trip", "Ok, point taken, but she is on a fixed income, and if OP is the one paying all the other expenses, including for this trip, she should get at least an equal say as the other adults, and I still think two yeses or one no on taking the child.", "She\u2019s refusing her daughter to go without her. her husband can go all he wants but she wants to be with her daughter. MIL doesn\u2019t override that because they live in her house.", "I hope you're being sarcastic... :)", "Getting a passport for your minor child requires both parents to be present or a notarized letter from the non present parent. So that's part of it. \nIf one parent takes the kid the other can call for kidnapping. It may not stick in court, but it'll stop them from getting on that plane.", "I have traveled all over with my kids, with it without their father nobody ever questioned them being with me. There are no \u201ccustody police\u201d at the airport.", "Lol very sarcastic", "I have literally taken my children to other countries without my wife present and with no approval. She's done the same. There is no united states law that requires that. If the TSA complained about it it's because the TSA regularly doesn't know the law.", "Because not all college programs and professors are as forgiving or understanding as your Spanish linguistics program? There's nothing \"freaking obvious\" here", "Right?  My advisor during my grad program absolutely wouldn\u2019t have been ok with me being gone in the middle of the semester.", "She's not making them forgo the trip. She wants them to move it to a different date", "Because she is currently their only source of income", "Fair point on flying with a baby.", "That's nice that you think that way and that your partner agrees with you. But a lot of comments here say I'm not in the minority. Maybe 50/50, but definitely not in the minority. It's also not as simple as a \"I won't let it\" happen situation. Husband and I take FAMILY vacations together. We prioritize each other and work together to work around each other's schedules. My husband would never let his mother decide when our young child was going on a vacation that we've been talking about for years, especially when that involves excluding me. Quite frankly, we have limited free time, so we enjoy spending our vacations together and both want to make memories with our children.", "Exactly!!!! I was hoping someone else would point this out. The trip is much more dangerous in the fall during hurricane season.", "And if it\u2019s not easy on everybody else? Being the sole provider doesn\u2019t mean everybody has to work around only your schedule. \n\nIf they are no longer together, what does she think will happen? That they can\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s not there?", "Her MIL chose a time of year she was least likely to be able to take off, because of her work. She says it\u2019s still possible it will be granted. Not everybody has an office job with flexibility for when they choose.", "MIL is retired and DH doesn't work.", "I work in a tax office, and one of our preparers took a once in a lifetime trip in March several years ago. It happens. She also turned down other trips that she could take in other parts of the year. \n\nYou make it work out. You make life work first. It's hard but not impossible, and yes, if OP's workplace is as popular as she says and in a populous city, there would be multiple people trained in her position and to deny her would be an indicator for a toxic, abusive workplace. Start thinking of your families, for god's sake. \n\nAnd stand up for yourself at work. Even if OP left the trip earlier than everyone else, or found some other work around, she is giving notice and the company should not, \"well maybe...\" her on a once in a lifetime trip. \n\nAnd people straight up die. I put off a trip for my uncle, and now he's dead. I put off other trips that now I'll never make. Busy season. As an accountant fresh out of busy season, FUCK BUSY SEASON. Think of what really matters here.", "My ex took our kids on International trips when they were minors and needed nothing from me. This must be new.", "Which state is that? Because mothers are not automatically granted any automatic rights over the fathers in any state I\u2019ve ever heard of.

Puerto Rico is a US territory. However, they  technically would be leaving the country. Puerto Rico isn't a state.", "Hey, noticed you wrote this after my edit where I acknowledged this. As written in my edit, my point of view hasn\u2019t changed because it\u2019s still a big trip across state lines.", "So you\u2019re upset that she-lemme recheck this-trusts her partner with their child, but that she wants to be involved in her child\u2019s life milestones? Truly?? That\u2019s your issue?", "100% agree. I got into it yesterday with someone who was making all of these ridiculous comments about parenting and how to handle a situation with a kid lying and it was obvious that this person has no kids. It\u2019s super easy for someone to say what they would or would not do as parent when they are not actually parents. I was one of those people that used to say \u201cwhen I have kids, I\u2019ll NEVER do xyz.\u201d How you would handle a situation in theory completely changes when you have kids. \n\nI have a 4 year old and a two year old. One week is a long time to be away from them, especially in a strange and unfamiliar place. Kids at this age need creature comforts and routine. Going on vacation throws everything off, especially when you change time zones. I would not be comfortable with my kids going on a trip for that long without me, even with my husband and MIL and I have a GREAT relationship with MIL. I also would not be comfortable going on a week trip with my kids without my husband. He took our oldest to visit his mom last summer for a few days and that was totally fine because it was to her house and we have a lot of stuff there for him. \n\nNTA for wanting to be there, but you also need to find a way to make it happen for all of your sake. It\u2019s far enough out that you can plan for it properly. Don\u2019t let your company bully you. Read your employee manual regarding scheduled PTO and figure out what the policy is. Never forget that you are just an employee and you will always be replaceable. The restaurant industry in particular is hurting and you would not have a hard time finding a job if push came to shove. You have more leverage than you think. Don\u2019t put your family and these experiences on hold over a job that would replace you in a week.", "So was New Orleans after Katrina what's your point", "Neither is DC, would you be leaving the country if you went there.", "I agree this should be done. However based on what OP has said about when she'd be available (in fall, AKA hurricane season) I'm not sure when they would even have a good time to plan out a trip safely.", "Correct, this is not an urgent trip with a planned event during it", "Yeah, that\u2019s what they say but they hardly ever do that.  I\u2019ve been on multiple international flights with my kids.  My wife was either flying separately because of work schedules or couldn\u2019t make it.  They never checked my notarized letters."]}
