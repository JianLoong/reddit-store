Or fingers, as it were.", "You can dismiss my experience all you want. It was an intensive outpatient setting with a gentleman who seemed quite normal who started interacting with his voices in the setting. We then went over what the condition is, and what it isn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what country you\u2019re from, but no one costed her the job. It would be illegal to fire her for her mental health as it easily could be considered a disability. You\u2019re also assuming management wouldn\u2019t be supportive of her. But according to the OP the manager is supportive. We have no idea if the employee is even unhappy in their new role. It may fit them better. \n\nFor someone who wants to point out so desperately I\u2019m not an expert, you\u2019re assuming a whole lot to make a point.", "Not everyone uses the DSM5. The ICD11 doesn\u2019t require this. And people can be diagnosed with schizophrenia from a single hospitalisation. My sibling was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and psychosis from a single hospitalisation for example, not the same diagnosis but similar symptoms with similar rankings of severity by professionals.\n\nAlso BTW 2 psychiatrists 10 years apart diagnosed me with ADHD in 1 day <3 I don\u2019t have ADHD and that diagnosis is no longer in my medical records. Psychiatry isn\u2019t an exact science. A lot of the time, psychiatrists don\u2019t follow exact diagnostic criteria, or if they do they interpret it in different ways, or they just have biases and stick a diagnosis on. I\u2019ve been in the MH system for over a decade, I\u2019ve seen many different psychiatrists.\n\nEdit: Also, a \u201cthorough work up is done\u201d. UM. No psychiatrist has requested that I take a blood test and that is true for other diagnoses, often a patient is not going to get a blood test to check that their symptoms are of physical origin. I know a person who did have a blood test before being diagnosed with schizophrenia though, and they\u2019ve been off antipsychotics for 2 years after taking them for 4 years. They have a master\u2019s in psychology BTW!", "> I'm belittling someone because they're constantly arguing that I'm saying something I'm not.\n\nSpecifically, you are belittling their struggles with mental health.\n\n> clearly I am the biggest AH here\n\nThat's right, belittling mental health issues is way more AH behaviour than twisting someone's words, glad we agree.", "She hasn't been fired *yet*, no. But part of the job has been taken away and management are treating her like she's dangerous (removing her from customer-facing stuff). Constructive dismissal - forcing somebody out by making the job unpleasant for them, or by inventing a paper trail of bogus write-ups - is only too common in cases like this.\n\nAnd illegal doesn't matter a damn if the person doesn't have the resources - time, money and energy - to sue. And prove it, the so-called employment protections in the US are a joke and it's really not difficult to pretend there was a different reason. Probably won't do them much good even if they won.", "You literally said the DSM5 is similar in requiring only 1 symptom, but now you're moving the goalposts and saying that it doesn't matter that you were wrong on that because the DSM isn't what everyone uses?\n\nPlus you're comparing with a completely different diagnosis?????\n\nYou're a confusing individual.  You're conflating things that aren't related.\n\nYes, mental health is 100% not an exact science.  Yes, diagnoses can change.  Same for any medical subsection."]}
