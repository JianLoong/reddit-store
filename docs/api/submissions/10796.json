Hallucinations with diabetes means sugars are definitely not well-controlled, and hallucinations when quitting alcohol could indicate that seizures are soon to follow and the person should be put on benzos temporarily.\n\nAlso, many people with schizophrenia stop taking their medication when they are feeling good, even though they need to be taking it consistently. OP doesn't know their medications, but, at the same time, it wouldn't be unusual for someone to stop taking them because \\*they\\* think they no longer need them and not because their doctor told them to stop.\n\nEdit: Also, just because she has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, it doesn't mean that this is a manifestation of that.

You and the boss decided her condition was why she needed to be moved not her job performance. You both discriminated against her and depending on where you live broke disability laws. Her condition is none of your business, at no point did she say she was a danger to herself or other, or exhibit behaviours that she was. She disclosed something to you so you could understand her better. You both clearly have biases against certain mental illnesses that need to be dealt with.

The ADA covers all forms of discrimination towards disabled people not just accommodations. And a boss cannot force someone to take accommodations or learn medical information without the employee\u2019s consent. \n\nOP shared the coworkers PHI (private health information) to a third party, and then the boss made a hiring (changing positions counts) decision based off the person\u2019s PHI. Even if viewed through the lens of accommodations, until the person\u2019s condition prevents them from doing basic job duties, a boss cannot even recommend accommodations out of the blue, and then the employee has to agree to said accommodations. \n\nSo OP and OP\u2019s boss violated the ADA in several different ways and opened the company up to being sued by said employee. And just because the person shared health info with OP does not mean OP had the right to share said info with anyone else. This post contains crimes.", "I work in HR. This is untrue.\n\nI would move her while we start the ADA process.

It means more that you have symptoms of both a mood disorder and schizophrenia, and most importantly that you experience psychosis outside of mood disorder episodes. That is to say, if you only experience psychosis when depressed or manic/hypomanic, you would have the diagnosis of mood disorder + psychotic features whereas with Schizoaffective Disorder means that I experience psychosis regardless of mood disorder episodes.\n\nIn my case, I am SZA Bipolar type, so while I have depressive episodes and hypomania (and regular experience psychosis within those states), I can experience psychosis regardless of mood. In that way, I think it's more accurate to say schizoaffective disorder is moreso having schizophrenia as the more prevalent one and the mood disorder more as the add on. But everyone experiences this illness a little differently, so I suppose it's possible for someone to have their mood disorder be more prevalent.", "Bipolar doesn't look like mood swings most of the time also.\n\nDepressed/manic is affecting your mood, but more so energy levels. Also this \"cycle\" is taking weeks and months (sometimes years) to go through.\n\n It's not like your mood is unpredictable on a day to day basis.

The dept change could also be because of OP -- in that the woman no longer wishes to work in her dept due to stigma. \n\nThe only thing I'm going to disagree with is her diagnosis being PHI. The coworker is not a patient so anything she shares freely *can* be gossipped about and no one was violating HIPAA. Them being in a medical setting doesn't make all medical related info PHI.
