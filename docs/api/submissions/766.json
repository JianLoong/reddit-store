If I didn't sleep like a brick I'd hate neighbors like you", "YTA living in an apartment requires respect and consideration, your floor is literally somebody else roof.", "YTA\n\n10 minutes of heels at 8pm? eh, annoying but not a big deal. An hour and a half? come on, you know you're the AH. \n\nAlso im sorry but i do not buy that it is difficult to walk quietly.  the awareness that you are not the only person who might be affected by your actions is something you should have attained \\*well\\* before your current age.  If you can't at least be cognizant of other people, buy a house or move to the bottom apartment or at least buy some thick area rugs.", ">I just don\u2019t feel like I should have to walk quietly in my own space\n\nBullshit. You're in an apartment. All the walls are shared. Outside typical daytime hours (7am to 10pm roughly) the reasonable and kind thing to do is be quiet.\n\nIf you want the freedom to make noise at all hours, make it a priority to get a detached home.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nApartment living sucks, but when you have an upstairs apartment, you do have to be considerate of your neighbors downstairs. You are walking on their ceiling. Put some rugs down. That will help reduce the noise, but ultimately, there was no reason for walking around your apartment in your high heels for 6 hours. Only inconsiderate people who don't have respect for anyone else, do this type of shit. If roles were reversed, how would you feel if some inconsiderate person was stomping around in the middle of the night in their heels for no reason other than because they felt like it?", "YTA.  You have neighbors and you are making a lot of noise late at night.  You live in a shared space.", "YTA im sorry but living in an apartment you need to think about your neighbours too. If you dont want that - buy a house.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to be quiet in your own home.   But they should be able to sleep in theirs.   They have tried to come up with a solution (ear plugs) and failed.   Now it\u2019s your turn to find a way to solve this problem.  Right now YTA.\n\nCarpets are the solution.   They will muffle sound.   If you jump about when you work out, confine that to daylight hours, and make sure you pad the floor well.  $10 can get you an enormous foam floor mat from Walmart, the kind designed for a home gym.   Lay that on the floor, over your hardwood, and put a carpet on top.   They\u2019ll never hear your footstep again.", "YTA. Consideration for others, especially when you live above someone else, is expected. Go barefoot or walk quietly and have some care for other people besides yourself.", "YTA - stop wearing heels in your apartment. Its called common courtesy. If you don\u2019t care about that, how about karma? It\u2019s rude and inconsiderate to your downstairs neighbors.", "Yes YTA, your apartment probably has noise restrictions for situations like this.  Usually it's quiet time after 10pm.  Exceptions aren't granted for larger people or if you want to work out at midnight.", "Info - what exactly what were you doing at 1:00am? You are allowed to walk around your own apartment but you describe it as stomping - which is rude to do if that is accurate. You also mention working out?\n\nYou are allowed to live your life, but you do need to show some consideration.\n\nEdit - fixed typo.", "YTA. Not being able to fall asleep at night due to an inconsiderate neighbor is my own personal hell (I speak from experience). \n\nBe a better person and a better neighbor.", "YTA. Welcome to apartment dwelling life. There are going to be \"normal\" noises from your neighbors, and there are going to be \"obnoxious\" noises. As a dweller, you need to learn the difference about what you're putting out there. Heels and stomping around are obnoxious.\n\nThink about that when you realize what it took for your neighbor to leave that note. It sounds like they've been putting up with you for some time now since they said they've been wearing earplugs. Heels and stomping was their last straw. You do need to be more considerate.", "You will hear noises in an apartment but acting like you shouldn\u2019t have to be considerate of other people in your own space especially in the evenings. I had concrete floors in my last place and never heard anyone. So you must be stomping super hard. \n\nGet carpet.", "Yta. After 11pm keep it down you have neighbours. 8pm isn't bad but 1am? Definitely yta.", "YTA. That's a disadvantage of apartment living. You need to (or at least should be) extra considerate of those around you. This obviously isn't the first time.

If you don't want to be considerate to someone living under you rent or buy a house.", "YTA I only ever wore slippers when I lived in an apartment because I did not want to disturb my neighbors. Living in an apartment building takes give and take and a little common sense.", "NAH you didn\u2019t realize it would be that loud, and they\u2019re not wrong to complain. Get some carpet and move on with life", "NAH, it's hard to realize how loud you are to people below you.  Rugs will help dampen the noise", "YTA for bothering other people and being inconsiderate. If you don't know how to behave in an upstairs appartment, you should get your own house.", "Noise from neighbors is part of living in apartments. Perhaps check your habits and see if you really are making a lot of noise after 10pm. Maybe carpets or something would help. \n\nI think this is NAH bordering on N T A. You should be able to live your life normally but since your neighbors complained, maybe you are being a bit loud afterhours.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m actually quite shocked at all the YTA. I\u2019m sorry but choosing to live an apartment and expecting total quite is ludicrous. One should automatically expect some level of normal noise and that includes day and night, not just day time like others are saying. Not everyone works the same hours or has the same lifestyle. Also before everyone starts jumping down my throat how not everyone can afford a house or how it\u2019s not a choice but a necessity, I\u2019m sorry but it was still they\u2019re choice. They could have easily chosen to find a top floor apartment, a carpeted apartment, or even moving to a mobile home. So girl, you do you! Rock your heels in your apartment, do those late cleanings, live your best life.", "NTA", "Idk where you live but my city\u2019s noise laws wouldn\u2019t apply to someone stomping around. No law is broken unless the noise you\u2019re making can be heard in the hallway of your building and even then it has to reach a certain decibel level to qualify as breaking the law.", "I don\u2019t have the money to buy carpets though, if it bothers them shouldn\u2019t they have to buy the carpets?", "Well I was just tidying up and doing chores. Like I was walking around putting the laundry away so I would walk from the living room to the closet and then back to the living room and then back to my bedroom. I also was tossing stuff into my room as needed, like I threw my backpack and it was probably a loud thunk tbh. Just random stuff like that getting ready for the next day. I notice the floor vibrate when I walk but I don\u2019t think they can hear us walking\u2026 it\u2019s just walking??", "Walking around in high heels and working out late at night is not \u201cnormal noise\u201d. Come on\u2026", "We actually have the only hardwood/concrete floor in the entire building hahaha, sucks for them IG", "Honestly, at best it warrants a house call from the police or property management to tell you to keep it down. Unless you're breaking said decibel level, more often than not they can't/won't actually do anything. It's why it makes people like that bad neighbors.", "No just stop stomping around", "Lmfao! They supposed to do what with them? Nail them to their ceiling? You gonna give them back when you move out of your apartment or when they move out of theirs?  Of course not. You want them gifted to you.. \n\nYou are obviously young, like in your 20s young. People shouldn't have to cater to YOU! You are making an obscene amount of noise unnecessarily and you want your downstairs neighbors to make adjustments to accommodate you being inconsiderate. There is a whole lot of you taking and no compromise on your end. You feel it should fall on everyone else around to get tf over it and it is a them problem that you are rude and inconsiderate.", "Yta. Walking around is fine - it's your apartment. Where else are you supposed to be? However throwing heavy objects on the floor - making loud noises - is not okay. Have a little consideration.", "The floor vibrates? Then it\u2019s very likely making loud creaking noises that you don\u2019t hear, but downstairs does. I have this issue above me and now the wall makes a clinking sound too when this happens, so that\u2019s awesome."]}
