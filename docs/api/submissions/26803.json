I can also understand the sentiment that maybe those exact boxers are just insanely comfy *because* they're so old and likely loose fitting by now. \n\nFood for thought:\nWhen i was younger i had a monkey toy with a soft label that i liked stroking between two of my fingers. I did this every night in bed for YEARS. My mum sewed on a new pair of trousers later as i'd destroyed the label.

There is some attachment to it, of course, but it's nothing emotional regarding her as my partner, it's been my sleeping shirt for years and that's where the attachment comes from, besides being a gift from a great person I still cherish as a friend.

Sure, they\u2019ve been around another dude, but they\u2019re just an object that (presumably) has been washed a lot.

Ignore the fact that the boxers belonged to her ex because it makes you seem just bothered over nothing.  \n\nI mean  sure, it could be considered something, but the thing is you letting the idea of another man get to you when ten years is a decade and these really are just her pjs now.  You say it\u2019s weird but he is not a threat so why do you actually care?  Really?  \n\nWhen my bf moved in he brought stuff with him since he had a life before me, and because I\u2019m not going to let my insecurity get the best of me I was glad to use whatever he brought just to prove to myself I\u2019m above petty illogical things and we used their old comforter from their bed for a long time.  What do I care?   It was nice and we needed it then.  I felt proud of that because I rose above an idea that was otherwise going to inconvenience me for no real reason.\n\nOne of the best things my bf has brought into my life is men\u2019s boxer briefs.  Is there a more comfortable item of clothing in existence?  I practically live in them but I don\u2019t look at them as what he wore because when we get new ones we both open the pack and no one acts possessive of them.  I\u2019ll be damned if I am going to not wear them because someone thinks it\u2019s weird.  I wouldn\u2019t let a breakup take my favorite loungewear away nor would I let a previous partner of his stop me from using a perfectly good comforter and that is how I make sure my brain and pretty illogical thinking never get the better of me.  \n\nIf you insist on this have you considered buying her some that are from you?  Since you want to make her replace her pjs you should maybe replace them yourself. It would at least be a gesture since your thinking is inconveniencing you and her for no real reason.

He did say that had I not mentioned it and just carried on sleeping with it he might not be as cool with it. My point being.... she isn't being very aware of your feelings here.

I can guarantee that while they may all be white, fabric and large they will not all be equal, or even equivalent.  Put 10 years of wear on these and there will not be an equivalency, and if you say that you can go and buy a new pack and have the same feel or by washing it have the same feel as the one particular style that I have grown to like the feel I would challenge you to predict which one that will be before going out to do the replacement and to put up $1000 as a guarantee of feel and satisfaction.\n\nYou wouldn't take that challenge and I wouldn't in the reverse position.
