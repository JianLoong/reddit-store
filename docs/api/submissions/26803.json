I did this every night in bed for YEARS. My mum sewed on a new pair of trousers later as i'd destroyed the label.

There is some attachment to it, of course, but it's nothing emotional regarding her as my partner, it's been my sleeping shirt for years and that's where the attachment comes from, besides being a gift from a great person I still cherish as a friend.

Sure, they\u2019ve been around another dude, but they\u2019re just an object that (presumably) has been washed a lot.

Ignore the fact that the boxers belonged to her ex because it makes you seem just bothered over nothing.  \n\nI mean  sure, it could be considered something, but the thing is you letting the idea of another man get to you when ten years is a decade and these really are just her pjs now.  You say it\u2019s weird but he is not a threat so why do you actually care?  Really?  \n\nWhen my bf moved in he brought stuff with him since he had a life before me, and because I\u2019m not going to let my insecurity get the best of me I was glad to use whatever he brought just to prove to myself I\u2019m above petty illogical things and we used their old comforter from their bed for a long time.  What do I care?   It was nice and we needed it then.  I felt proud of that because I rose above an idea that was otherwise going to inconvenience me for no real reason.\n\nOne of the best things my bf has brought into my life is men\u2019s boxer briefs.  Is there a more comfortable item of clothing in existence?  I practically live in them but I don\u2019t look at them as what he wore because when we get new ones we both open the pack and no one acts possessive of them.  I\u2019ll be damned if I am going to not wear them because someone thinks it\u2019s weird.  I wouldn\u2019t let a breakup take my favorite loungewear away nor would I let a previous partner of his stop me from using a perfectly good comforter and that is how I make sure my brain and pretty illogical thinking never get the better of me.  \n\nIf you insist on this have you considered buying her some that are from you?  Since you want to make her replace her pjs you should maybe replace them yourself. It would at least be a gesture since your thinking is inconveniencing you and her for no real reason.

Also, due to previous relationships, you might have learned that when you expose an emotional or mental need, it's spun back at you later on to make you hurt ( sucker punch of a private convo). \n\nThis is why I am suggesting that you practice communicating more. Explain to her, that you screwed up in saying you won't cuddle ( because then you are communicating \"sex or satisfying outcomes get rewards\" ). Explain to her that stupid things like those boxers bother you and you know that you feel \"im touchy something her ex wore round his ass\". it's truthful and factual. Then ask her to consider your point of view. tell her that you accept all outcomes and just ask her to think about it.

Because you communicated that you were looking for an acceptance of the issue, not asking her to remove it or dispose of it, just accepting that it's a bother to you. \n\nIf she just ignores it, I would then think that a huge red flag has been raised, you need to do a detailed review of your life and discover if there are any other flags that you did not see.

It will only snowball from there once a manipulator gets a small sense of control.\n\nYour insecurities should be spoken about with a therapist, not dumped onto your partner. Anyone who does probably isnt ready for a relationship and needs more time for self reflection/awareness.", "I can't imagine OP has an issue that the fabric touched her ex's balls. It's still a tie to her ex. He calmly spoke to her that it made him uncomfortable and asked her not to wear them anymore. Even if they were nothing more than pajamas to her, she put pajamas over his feelings.", "Lmao I actually agree... his whole issue is simply that it touched another dudes parts 10 years. Like wtf!?", "first off, congrat's on the positive outcome of weight loss. maybe your new hoodie can be washed lot's of times in alternate temperatures and very hot dryer setting? that should ruin it or make it really soft. \n\nAlso, next time you have a cold, sleep in it. that should speed up the process.", "Toss in a few tablespoons of white vinegar to your washer when you wash it. It'll help soften the fibers.", "I have sweat pants that are 22 years old. I wore them when I was captain of my high school wrestling team haha. I love these pants dearly", "That's so weird though.  Yes you can be emotionally over something and still have physical things from that time.  \n\nHealthy people are perfectly capable of moving on without getting rid of possessions.  Are you saying you're incapable of that?", "A pair of boxers isn't a momento lmao They're probably literally just comfy. Assigning some special meaning to every random thing your ex ever left at your house seems way more like a sign you haven't moved on than keeping a piece of clothing you like.", "wait, you are kidding right? firehose canvas? against your junk? chafing must be brutal.", "Aw, you beat me.  My oldest that's still good is 2005", "\ud83d\ude01 If my ex bought it, and my live-in gf had already expressed being uncomfortable with me wearing it, and then bought me a new one, then yes i think i would.\n But we also are talking about underwear and not a hoodie.", "Im sorry you went through that but I think its a bit of a far ass reach to say OP not wanting his gf to wear another mans boxers, regardless of how old they are, could snowball into abuse. All he did was say it makes him uncomfortable. Regardless of whether you personally think he should be uncomfortable or not, her response shows shes a bit more attached than it seems, since she belittled him over his feelings on the matter. He can just get her new boxers if she just wants boxers as PJs. Me personally, I wouldnt really want my partner hanging on to anything from their ex, with exceptions of a death or something. We can definitely have a conversation about it, but its a little odd to be belittled over it. OP is not far off with this one. \n\nAlso important to note: you mention a million others wouldnt care. That doesnt disregard the feelings of others.", "Wow. OP feels uncomfortable and expresses that = abuse. Take a step back from the internet for a bit maybe.  \nIt is completely normal and healthy to discuss insecurities with your partner. They are your partner, not an acquaintance. That doesn\u2019t mean dump everything on them, of course, but saying \u201cI\u2019m weirded out by this thing you\u2019re doing\u201d is completely normal. It\u2019s called communication and you\u2019re advocating for less of that?", "Thanks. We're coming into warmer weather where I am, and I've considered chucking it in the wash every week, even when it's not being worn, so by the time the cooler weather rolls around it's hopefully started to get softer.", "Agreed. I have some of my exes shirts and they don\u2019t feel like his anymore. They\u2019re MINE (he gave them to me in the first place anyways, didn\u2019t care that I kept them when we broke up). I also have \u201ccomfort\u201d clothes, and one of \u201chis\u201d shirts is one of them. I always forget they were originally his", "And it very well could be that the girlfriend sees it as nothing more than a piece of clothing. But she's putting a piece of clothing over her boyfriend's feelings", "They\u2019re fucking with you. \n\nThe real best boxers are Pair of Thieves though", "Sorry, yes. The gimmick of Duluth Trading is that a lot of their stuff - rugged work pants, jackets, Carhartt type stuff - is made from firehose canvas. Their boxers probably aren't. \n\nProbably.", "Why not discuss with your gf what exactly makes her uncomfortable instead ?", "Her boyfriend is putting his feelings over their relationship. I would never ask my girlfriend to get rid of something she likes and that she's owned since before she knew me because it made me feel weird. I would talk to her about those feelings and ask for reassurance and for her help to get over those feelings but I wouldn't make her get rid of the boxers.", "He said he already did that and she called him an asshole", "He tried to talk to her and she completely disregarded him and his feelings.", "Stop that. The boyfriends feeling matters in a relationship just as much as a girls. He expressed something that made him uncomfortable, that clearly from this thread many people find it to be a valid reason. Little sacrifices and compromises are made all the time in a relationship. A pair boxers aint the hill to die on", "I\u2019d argue that the boyfriend is putting a piece of clothing over the relationship, since he\u2019s the one issuing ultimatums about what she can wear.", "I mean, saying that this makes me uncomfortable and understanding why are two separate and very different things. The one is easy, the other could need hours of analysis and conversation. The one is rather painless, since its simply the surface, the other is gonna be uncomfortable and exposing. The one will lead nowhere, the other will lead to a better understanding of his self, his needs and probably how to handle his emotions"]}
