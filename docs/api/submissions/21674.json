Say \"I tried this but they are too many and in difficult ages and I can't give them the care they need. It's irresponsible to continue doing this.\" Also, it sounds like the two year needs a doctor's opinion.", "NTA.  Give her something like 2 weeks notice.  I would straight up tell her that the 2 year old is too much for you to handle.  Apologize that you are sorry about it and you hate going back on your agreement but you just cannot do it anymore.", "You took money from her then you offered to do this to pay her back. You need to do what you said you would do or give the money back. Why are you letting a 2 yo walk all over you in your house?", "Changing judgment since I severely misunderstood this was not a one day thing. NTA. You didn\u2019t have all the info when you first agreed and now you are dealing with something you didn\u2019t agree to in the first place.\n\nThat kind of behavior is not acceptable to make a babysitter deal with regardless of how much money you have lent them in the past. \n\n\n~~Why did you agree in the first place if you hate her kid so much~~\n\n~~YWBT.A to agree and then go back on it for no other reason than you changed your mind.

Now you still haven\u2019t repaid her.\n\nWhy are you staying at home with your kid instead of earning the money to repay her?\n\nWhy do you have \u201cpriceless first edition novels\u201d out for the kids to destroy instead of selling them and repaying her?\n\nShe\u2019s a single parent, working long hours, with 2 little ones to care for. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s sitting on a trust fund and could easily spare the money she was kind enough to help your 2 parent/1 child family with. Now she needs help. Help she can\u2019t buy, since you haven\u2019t repaid her.\n\nI understand how overwhelming it can be to provide the care you\u2019ve been doing, but you need to figure out how to do a better job at it and provide the care at least until you\u2019ve repaid your debt and then until there can be another arrangement made. She helped you when you needed it, so you owe her the same.\n\nGo through your whole apartment with the idea that every item the kid can get to will be broken if they are able to break it, used to hurt themselves if that\u2019s possible, etc. Put all dangerous or fragile items in a room with a door and lock it. Do not let the kids be unsupervised at all. Establish a potty routine and work on getting both older kids using the potty every time. The child will probably settle into your routine once you have one established and the behavior will improve, as he is probably reacting to the change in his environment, just like your son is. \n\nIf you truly cannot provide safe care, you need to pay your debt with money or you are an asshole.", "You have raised a well behaved 4 year old.

He already destroyed a lot. This may not be the best way to pay her back.\n\nIs it possible she puts one kid in daycare for a bit? Until you get a handle on two kids. Then maybe start adding the third?", "Ok, first of all, it's on adults to childproof their home. Electronics and valuables out of reach or in storage. That is on you.\n\nAs for the kid, diaper then zip PJs on backwards so they can't get the diaper off, or duct tape the diaper, or one on forward one on backwards. \n\nThen lots of outside runaround time. Plan activities.\n\nBut really, there's a debt between you and your sister. You owe her. And maybe you could've paid her back if you weren't buying brand new iPads. But you've gotta do this.\n\nYTA.", "He doesn\u2019t hate the kids? He clearly didn\u2019t know of their behavior until he spent the day with them. Long enough for his own son to pick up on the habits. And he\u2019s absolutely allowed to change his mind after dealing with that", "No there here 3 times a week. Rn I have them all weekend.", "Who gonna pay for the damages cause by sil toddler?", "I\u2019ve really never seen the 2 year old act like this for anyone before. It\u2019s just the first day she dropped him off and left this behavior started. And now my son is copying it. He\u2019s talking back, not listening, and he\u2019s having regular accidents now when he was fully potty trained before.", "It\u2019s possible but I\u2019d feel guilty. I really don\u2019t know what to do. And yes he has destroyed a lot. I didn\u2019t think kids would destroy books but sure enough the minute I turned by back he found the most expensive ones and tore the pages out. Like he knew what he was doing.", "Thank you. I don\u2019t hate them I just really didn\u2019t know what I was getting into with them.", "Ok so maybe I misunderstood, hence my last question. \n\nI thought he was saying take them for a day already knowing these things.

Absolutely NTA if you didn\u2019t know this ahead of time and then have to deal with the nightmare of this regularly.", "Hardly the issue when he owes her money. \n\nHe\u2019s an adult, so it\u2019s on him to supervise in a way that does not incur damage. It\u2019s annoying to have to clean or replace a couch, but a child that young needs to be watched in case they get hurt, not just to save your precious stuff.", "Children tend to regress when younger kids are getting their parent\u2019s attention. The 2 year old isn\u2019t teaching your kid bad behavior. \n\nIt appears this kid has free range in your home. Perhaps you should create a space where all these kids can safely play & nap. I\u2019m guessing you just had no idea how to manage 3 kids before jumping in to this situation. You\u2019re basically running a daycare. I suggest you do some reading on how to manage that. \n\nYou have my sympathy.... as a mom of 4 kids under 4 (now grown adults) I know the struggle is real.\n\neta \u2014 the goal is caring for these kids. If you can\u2019t provide a safe, happy environment while maintaining your sanity then you should not be doing this. It\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s best interest.\n\neta more \u2014 I have no idea how long you have been watching these kids but little kids need time to adjust to big changes in their routines. Since this is new behavior for all these kids it could just be that this is a challenging new situation for all of them. Maybe they just need a minute, some reassurance & boundaries.", "It\u2019s a new situation for all of you. It will take some time and patience to get everyone working together.", "Kids love to destroy books. It\u2019s possible sil has them put away. Or told him not to. So yours being in arms reach grab his attention. \n\nI would talk to your wife about the damages and go from there.", "Have you and your wife repaid her the money already? She could use that for daycare instead", "Im sorry, I severely misunderstood the post. I thought you knew those things going into a one day sitting and still agreed to it. Changed my post and judgement", "It would seem it is every day while the mom is at work", "No we haven\u2019t. Not even close.", "Thank you. I don\u2019t want to go back on my word but I feel like crying when I know there coming for the day.", "Thank you for correcting me!", "Well I still don\u2019t think you\u2019re indebted to watching these kids. And it\u2019s unfair of your wife to guilt you as well. Maybe she could try watching them and see what it\u2019s like", "Then yeah, you do have to take care of them to avoid being an asshole. Or you can give her the cash and she can pay for a sitter or daycare.\n\nThe issues with the 2-year-old destroying stuff are because you have not childproofed effectively. He should not be able to get to stuff he can destroy.", "That level of stress is not something you should have to put yourself through just for the sake of keeping a promise. New info came up and it seems like a discussion with your SIL is warranted. You truly did try to help and have helped for the time, but you need healthy boundaries for your own mental health as well.", "Cry, dry your tears, and step up to the plate. Taking care of little kids is hard, but that\u2019s what you have to do sometimes.", "He destroyed the couch and carpet by going to the bathroom on it. But I could do a better job with the other stuff. It\u2019s just my son never destroyed anything.", "If he had, you\u2019d have dealt with it somehow though, right? Not said you can\u2019t watch him?\n\nCover the couch and floor, get him in waterproof pants or pull-ups and march him to the potty if he tries to take them off. Some kids are harder to supervise than others, but you can do this. Your own kid is acting up now too, so time to parent.", "I\u2019ve been trying to do that but the younger one is very needy too. If I take my eyes off him one second the diaper is already off and he\u2019s poop or peed somewhere.", "But how would anyone else deal with it? These aren\u2019t unsupervisable kids, so there are things you aren\u2019t doing. \n\nSometimes people put kids in clothes that are more difficult to remove, maybe that would work for the baby\u2014something that zips up the back, for instance. Then he couldn\u2019t remove the diaper.", "NTA for not wanting to continue to watch your nephew, but you do need to pay your sister back ASAP. You owe her, pay her. If you continue to withhold the money, that would make you an AH.", "Lol ofc your wife is telling you to help her, one that\u2019s her sister, two she\u2019s not the one who has to deal with that. I think your reasons are 100% valid for no longer wanting to help them.", "Ever looked after 3 kids under 5 at the same time, 1 with behaviour problems and 1 an actual baby? Coz your comment strongly suggests you haven't", "Idk it\u2019s on the sister though for not correcting her sons behavior. Cause if her son did that in daycare or in an actual elementary school. That would\u2019ve caused serious problems. He\u2019s not wrong for backing out of babysitting. But him and his wife should slowly start paying them back tbh.", "If his sister in law son was in daycare and acted like that he would\u2019ve gotten kicked out for that behavior. His sister in law needs to get a grip and correct her son\u2019s behavior before he starts acting like that in elementary school when he\u2019s in kindergarten. Cause school like that would never put up with that At ALL", "Yeah definitely stop watching them, if she is able to help your family out financially then I think she\u2019s able to hire a babysitter. She\u2019s kinda using you as free daycare as an exchange of lending you money. Which really isn\u2019t okay\u2026", "Yeah kids pick up on behaviors the more they spend time with the person they\u2019re learning it from. Might want to limit how much he\u2019s around her kids cause your sons gonna be in kindergarten soon and you definitely don\u2019t want him acting like that at school.", "Of course some kids destroy books. He\u2019s 2\u2013it\u2019s totally normal for him to have no impulse control and tornado around. You have to keep your stuff secured and guide him to appropriate toys. Some kids are calm and cooperative, but it\u2019s not even slightly weird for a 2-year-old to tear up a book or draw on a wall. They start fires and spill poisons and cause floods and stuff if you don\u2019t keep close watch.", "Yes but a child who bad behavior is causing damage to someone house. The parents are responsible for that damage. \n\nWhat about carpet? Or the wall needing painting? Does all that get subtract from the amount owed? Or is op and wife expected to eat that. \n\nThis isnt op only option to pay sil back.", "It\u2019s his sister in laws RESPONSIBILITY to teach her son not to act that way. If her son was in daycare he would\u2019ve gotten kicked out cause no way in hell would any daycare put up with that behavior five days a week. She needs to be a better parent especially before her son is in kindergarten.", "When you owe someone money, it\u2019s not the time to try to bill them for stuff you let their kid ruin.", "The child is 2. There is no bad behavior. OP should be a better supervisor and have activities for a toddler to do instead of letting them free roam in his house", "It was OP\u2019s responsibility to take care of himself financially, but SIL helped out. \n\nNobody can teach a 2-year-old to act appropriately 100% of the time when they are not even in the room. Maybe a daycare would be able to manage the child better, given their years of experience. A toddler is expected to often scream, tantrum, write on walls at every opportunity, and have potty accidents. That\u2019s nothing to get kicked out of daycare over.", "Yes, blaming a child for adult problems. This kid is regressing - if the child built a relationship with the caregiver than the listening and respect will come in.", "My almost two year old is better behavior than that. He can be left unsupervised while I take care of my three month old. Like change a diaper. Without him pooping and peeing everywhere.", "Exactly which is why his main focus should be paying her back and maybe finding a job rather than being a stay at home dad. Which would be more beneficial. And a daycare would never allow a kid who poops and pees everywhere intentionally to act like that.", "Lucky you. Not every child is like that. It\u2019s not because you somehow deserve an easier situation.", "They wouldn\u2019t allow a child to do those things, correct. That doesn\u2019t mean they kick them out for it. They have rules and practices and enforce them. OP does not have those skills.", "Just stop watching them and slowly start paying her back. Cause her kids are out of control. Not worthy it tbh. Yes she\u2019s family but it\u2019s uncalled for you to be dealing with that everyday. She\u2019s honestly using you as a free daycare by also lending you money. I would limit the amount of time you ask her for money but also start paying her back. If she\u2019s able to help your family out financially then she\u2019s able to afford daycare or some type of babysitters. And of course your wife wants you to help her cause 1 doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s the one watching them and 2 that\u2019s her sister. If it was one of your family members and your wife was watching them I\u2019m sure she would be fed up with it by now."]}
