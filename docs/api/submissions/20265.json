As we became teenagers and our lives got busier, we naturally did drift apart, but still talked every two weeks or so during college. During Mae\u2019s third year of college, she suddenly stopped talking to everyone in the family. She dropped out of school without telling any of us. Her parents had to find out from a classmate. We reported her as missing because we were afraid something bad happened to her. Mae sent a message to the family letting us know she was okay but that she had never felt satisfied with her previous life and just needed to start over. \r  \n\r  \nMae had never let on that she felt this way during our conversations. And it obviously hurt that she hadn\u2019t tried to talk to me about it before just leaving. The only reason I maintained a lot of my social media profiles for a while after was so Mae would be able to find me if she ever changed her mind. I tried reaching out to her as well but I admit that after about two years I gave up and accepted Mae as a lost cause.\r  \n\r  \nWe had no contact with Mae for almost seven years. But she recently returned. Mae has three children; A five-year-old and two-year-old twins. She never told us about them. Mae never reached out during her pregnancies or after any of their births. Mae explained that her daughter\u2019s father had passed away and the twins\u2019 had taken off. She was doing her best on her own, but after the boy twin was diagnosed with a disability, she realized that she couldn\u2019t do it on her own anymore. \r  \n\r  \nMae\u2019s parents are willing to take her in and help with the grandchildren, but she said it would be hard for her because she knows they\u2019re disappointed in her and the life choices she\u2019s made, and seeing their faces/the way they look at her everyday would pose even more of a strain on her mental health. Mae asked to move in with me, saying that she knows I understand what it\u2019s like to be a mother because of my own three-year-old son and brought up our childhood friendship with each other.\r  \n\r  \nI told Mae that I have also been hurt and disappointed by her actions. She never tried to talk with me about her feelings of dissatisfaction or wanting to start over. Instead she just took off and left us to worry about her. I can empathize with being a mother, but I also need to put my own child\u2019s well-being first. What if my son grows attached to her and her children just for her to run out of our lives again? My son has had enough loss in his life. How could I allow her to move in and trust her not to hurt us again?\r  \n\r  \nMae is staying with her parents right now. Mae texted me, saying she wished I had allowed her to move in, because, as she told me before, it\u2019s a huge mental strain on her to live with her parents and seeing the disappointment in their eyes everyday. She also told me that she hoped our years of friendship would have meant more to me when she was facing such a low point in her life, both when she first left and now that she\u2019s returned.

Now she's got three kids she's absolutely responsible for.\n\nHer parents are letting her and her kids stay with them. That's great news! Tough shit she whines it'll be difficult for her. Tell her to suck it up, and if the arrangements don't suit her, to work hard so she can then move out. Unbelievable you even have to explain that to an adult.\n\nNo need for you to even explain any of your actions and decisions (about her abandoning everyone, yada yada). As you said, *you need to put your own child's well-being first*. You don't really need to explain a NO response to anyone -- nobody's business but your own -- but if push comes to shove, \"My child's needs *always* come first; good luck to you, and bye!\"", "NTA. Her actions were her choice and the consequences thereof are not your responsibility.", "NTA, and if you decide to go ahead with it don't be completely surprised if you wake up one day with four kids and no Mae.\n\nThere's a reason she finds it difficult to deal with her parents disappointment but not yours, and I'm guessing it's because she sees you as a pushover.", "NTA\n\nDo you even have a house big enough to accommodate? Your family will suddenly more than double.\n\nWhat would the sleeping arrangements be? Assume Mae would need her own room. Your son should have his own room.\n\nSo you'd need at least 3 extra rooms (one for Mae, one for the daughter, and one for the twins). \n\nUltimately you are being asked to completely change how you live, and she does have somewhere to stay", "Sounds like she\u2019s looking for someone to dump her adult responsibilities on. Different if she came back because she actually wanted to reconnect, but this is basically any port in a storm. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t allow myself to be used like this either.\n\nHer kids are her responsibility.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her anything. She made her bed, let her lie in it. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s suffering, she and the kids have a roof over their heads.", "NTA. I\u2019d also be ready to bet that Mae would not pay rent and expect you to co-parent the children", "NTA, even without the background I wouldn't blame you at all for not wanting four unexpected house mates, three of whom are small children and all of which are total strangers to you.", "Those \"years of friendship\" that she clearly threw away and is now using to manipulate you? \n\nNTA. Do what's best for your child!", "\"She hoped our years of friendship meant more to me\". Emotional manipulation much? That friendship obviously didn't mean anywhere near as much to her as it did you given what she put you and her family through and it's effect on you. She doesn't get to play that card on you now. Uno reverse that one pronto. NTA", "NTA - keep that master manipulator at arms length!", "She \"hoped your years of friendship would have meant more?\" Really? Does she mean the years of friendship she threw away to \"go start over\" and ghost her entire family? Those years? \n\nNTA. She doesn't get to hurt her entire family and expect everyone to act like nothing happened when she suddenly decides to come back. And it's not like she came back because she missed you all and realized she was wrong to go about things the way she did. She only came back because she needed help and didn't have any other options. She sounds extremely selfish. I wouldn't be surprised if she decided to go \"start over\" again once her kids are settled in with their grandparents that they've never met.", "NTA. Mae is in a mess of her own making for which she needs to take responsibility. By trying to get away from her parents she\u2019s trying to avoid dealing with the hurt she caused. There\u2019s a concept called \u201cDisfunctional Rescuing\u201d and that\u2019s what OP would be doing if she let Mae hide out at her house.", "NTA. She moved on, so did you.", "Yeah NTA.\n\n>she knows I understand what it\u2019s like to be a mother because of my own three-year-old son and brought up our childhood friendship with each other.\n\nThat right there is a fine attempt at emotionally blackmailing you.\n\n>I can empathize with being a mother, but I also need to put my own child\u2019s well-being first.\n\nWhich is the correct choice - she's shown you where you lay on her priority list and also made it clear with her behaviour that you're little more than a ticket to crash somewhere she doesn't get reminders or emotional fallout from her life choices.\n\n>Mae texted me, saying she wished I had allowed her to move in, because, as she told me before, it\u2019s a huge mental strain on her to live with her parents and seeing the disappointment in their eyes everyday. She also told me that she hoped our years of friendship would have meant more to me when she was facing such a low point in her life, both when she first left and now that she\u2019s returned.\n\nIt's not on _you_ that she decided to make the choices she did - she had a chance every second of every day to alter her mind or keep in touch, but took the option to not do so.\n\nNow that this has consequences, she doesn't like it _and_ needs to accept she's done just as much harm to her friends as to her family by noping out of her \"past life\" and only coming back into yours now, that it suits her.\n\nYou have a life, too. You also have a child to think of and those are the important things.\n\nThat she couldn't just tell you \"thanks I appreciate you letting me know\" and just moving on with her life? It's telling.", " You did nothing wrong and you/your kid should not have to disadvantage yourself to have 4 more people moving in with you, especially if she has a home.", "Mae mae mae. If it isn't the consequences of her own actions. \n\nOps nta", "OP needs to own it though.  Don\u2019t blame her child and say the problem is Mae might leave.  The problem is adding four people to a single mothers household and everything that comes with it\n\nOP doesn\u2019t want may their for justifiable reasons, don\u2019t scapegoat the son", "OP doesn't have to own anything.  The cousin made a huge request.  OP gave a reasonable answer, and she doesn't have to justify her response to the cousin or anyone else, whether that was the entire/true reason or not.  If the cousin mentions it again, OP can just say, \"That won't work for me,\" or \"I'm sorry, but I said no.\"  No explanation needed. \n\nNTA", "The other father dying made me pause too. Her ex leaving because he didn\u2019t want to parent or broke up with her sounds legit, a death is much bigger and would have affected her daughter considerably, as well as Mae. If it\u2019s true then this child has been through losing her dad then losing her stepdad, the twins father, in a different way and now has to navigate a new extended family she\u2019s never known about. That\u2019s huge and slightly suspicious- as you say, they only have Mae\u2019s word on this and I\u2019d want some details before agreeing to take on the housing and cost three kids, one with a disability, plus an adult who has been a ghost for years. Op is NTA.", "Then she needs to open up her mouth and talk about this good reason.  \n\nSeriously, the prospect that one of her partners was abusive and may be still out there, alive and kicking, is even more justification to not bring her into OP's home.  But keeping it secret from the OP would be the turd on top of a shit sundae.  I wouldn't want to shelter someone who is lying to me about something like that, even if their lie is motivated by self-preservation.  What about *my* self-preservation and my kid's?  No fucking way.\n\nETA: I am not advocating what the parent comment is suggesting.  But I think it makes sense for the OP to be skeptical of Mae's story, given that cutting off family for 7 years without warning is something you'd expect from someone with an abusive spouse.", "ETA: I am not advocating what the parent comment is suggesting.
