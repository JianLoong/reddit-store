As we became teenagers and our lives got busier, we naturally did drift apart, but still talked every two weeks or so during college. During Mae\u2019s third year of college, she suddenly stopped talking to everyone in the family. She dropped out of school without telling any of us. Her parents had to find out from a classmate. We reported her as missing because we were afraid something bad happened to her. Mae sent a message to the family letting us know she was okay but that she had never felt satisfied with her previous life and just needed to start over. \r  \n\r  \nMae had never let on that she felt this way during our conversations. And it obviously hurt that she hadn\u2019t tried to talk to me about it before just leaving. The only reason I maintained a lot of my social media profiles for a while after was so Mae would be able to find me if she ever changed her mind. I tried reaching out to her as well but I admit that after about two years I gave up and accepted Mae as a lost cause.\r  \n\r  \nWe had no contact with Mae for almost seven years. But she recently returned. Mae has three children; A five-year-old and two-year-old twins. She never told us about them. Mae never reached out during her pregnancies or after any of their births. Mae explained that her daughter\u2019s father had passed away and the twins\u2019 had taken off. She was doing her best on her own, but after the boy twin was diagnosed with a disability, she realized that she couldn\u2019t do it on her own anymore. \r  \n\r  \nMae\u2019s parents are willing to take her in and help with the grandchildren, but she said it would be hard for her because she knows they\u2019re disappointed in her and the life choices she\u2019s made, and seeing their faces/the way they look at her everyday would pose even more of a strain on her mental health. Mae asked to move in with me, saying that she knows I understand what it\u2019s like to be a mother because of my own three-year-old son and brought up our childhood friendship with each other.\r  \n\r  \nI told Mae that I have also been hurt and disappointed by her actions. She never tried to talk with me about her feelings of dissatisfaction or wanting to start over. Instead she just took off and left us to worry about her. I can empathize with being a mother, but I also need to put my own child\u2019s well-being first. What if my son grows attached to her and her children just for her to run out of our lives again? My son has had enough loss in his life. How could I allow her to move in and trust her not to hurt us again?\r  \n\r  \nMae is staying with her parents right now. Mae texted me, saying she wished I had allowed her to move in, because, as she told me before, it\u2019s a huge mental strain on her to live with her parents and seeing the disappointment in their eyes everyday. She also told me that she hoped our years of friendship would have meant more to me when she was facing such a low point in her life, both when she first left and now that she\u2019s returned.

NTA", "Bingo!!!  She\u2019s already pulling the \u201cBuT I\u2019m A SingLe MotHer\u201d whine. \nTo which the reply should be \u201cand?\u201d .", "If he is deceased and it's legit she should be receiving a widow's pension or at least some money for the children and SSDI/ disability for the one twin, so she should have some basic income. NTA, let her parents deal with it while she sorts her life out.", "Hell. She should see it when she looks in the mirror.", "This is terrifying. What if there\u2019s a good reason she ran? This is a really tone deaf idea.", "If she suddenly cut all contact maybe she ended up in abusive relationship and felt ashamed, one of the first things abusers do is isolate. Maybe her last baby daddy was a abusive or a deadbeat or actually dead who knows.", "Old Mae is just thinking about Maeagain, and not you.\n\nText her back: You\u2019re the problem Mae. You never gave me a thought, never considered me at all, by not communicating for years, and now I need a healthy boundary of not sharing my home, and my child, with someone who has shown me again and again I don\u2019t matter all that much. After ghosting me for years, you now want something, and I can\u2019t meet an unreasonable request. That doesn\u2019t make me the bad person, and deep down you know that. Good luck on your journey, and I hope your journey leads you to a mature understanding of yourself.", "So she hoped your years of friendship would have meant more to you, but it didn\u2019t mean anything to her when she took off? NTA.\n\nYou gotta put you and your child before all. And before anyone says, \u201cBut she IS family,\u201d that obviously didn\u2019t mean anything to her when she left. The audacity of some people I swear. \n\nI always think, you can do anything you want, just be prepared to face the consequences.\n\nMae can figure her life out. You do you. Stay strong.", "\u201c\u2026 hoped our years of friendship would have meant more to me \u2026\u201d Meant more to you than your own son? Pfft. Mae but she needs to suck it up and stop guilt tripping you. NTA.", "Mae is an adult and should clean her own mess. You can not demand devotion (and housing) from people after ghosting them for_seven years _.\nNTA.", "Nta you don't owe her anything", "You are NTA. Stop taking her calls. She will dump her kids on you and leave.", "All I can think to say is you have got to be kidding me, which of course I know OP is not. \n\nMae was apparently driven by God knows what hidden feelings to leave them all and now she is back and expecting the world from OP. I saw no mention of payment for what she presents as an permanent stay. \n\nWhile she might run off again, there is no saying she will take her kids with her. Then what? \n\nMar herself brought up her mental health and I sure wonder what is wrong with her. OP can be sure she will continue to be erratic and selfish.  She should say NO firmly and without apology.", "Nta", "She didn't care about you for years.  Now she wants something from you that is a huge inconvenience.  To Hell with you all these years but can I move in now?", "Nta. She is not homeless.  She is receiving the help she needs. \n\nYour plate is full momma", "NTA! Mae is being emotionally manipulative. She wants to move in with you but didn\u2019t care about the relationship between you until she needed something from you.", "NTA\n\n> Mae\u2019s parents are willing to take her in and help with the grandchildren, but she said it would be hard for her because she knows they\u2019re disappointed in her and the life choices she\u2019s made, and seeing their faces/the way they look at her everyday would pose even more of a strain on her mental health.\n\nA good parent would take the shame for the good of her kids.", "She is so selfish it\u2019s hilarious. Ask her why her mental health is more important than yours. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Good for you for doing what's in the best interest of your child. What gets me is that people like OP's cousin don't h deter snd how things cost. For example thy think well you're already paying the rent anyways so we can stay for free. But things cost! Water, heat, electricity, food, soap, laundry detergent, dish washing liquid, toiletries and food. The cost of that would cost 3x as much. That's crazy.", "NTA", "Hmm, I would explain to Mae- that you need to prioritise your own child- care, education, environment and your own health and well-being. You both should aim to \u201cgrow back\u201d into the friendship first- before opening your home to a whole family. People, change a lot after kids and decades- don\u2019t get into a situation you can\u2019t get out of. \n\nAlso to consider-  children really do like their own place and space and privacy - which your child will have to give up 100% with 3 unknown minors in the house 24/7. That\u2019s a big ask on your young child. My kid hated it when I offered a friend of a friend a room for a few weeks. Like really hated it- I had to share \u201cher\u201d room - which she resented and the guest ignored all our house rules- no smoking, don\u2019t leave your shit all over the apartment, don\u2019t park in the neighbours space etc. My \u201chelp\u201d offer turned real bad real fast.", ">She also told me that she hoped our years of friendship would have meant more to me when she was facing such a low point in her life, both when she first left and now that she\u2019s returned. AITA?\n\nNotice that she said nothing about this being a temporary move, or just for a while until she could get on her feet. No, she fully intended to move in and mooch of you permanently.\n\nIf she wants to bring up friendship then she needs to know it goes both ways. Friends don't abandon each other like she did. Friends don't mooch off the support of their friends - they work hard to get back on their feet and repay the favour later.\n\nIt's sad that she's having a rough life but that isn't your responsibility. If she wants her parents to stop being so disappointed in her, she should be doing everything she can to become independent.\n\nNTA.", "Oh geez I\u2019m so sorry there is a mental strain on Mae. It would be soooooooo much better if Mae could live strain free with you and YOU had the mental strain.\n\nNTA\n\nActions have consequences. The diminishment of your relationship with Mae is one of those.", "Don\u2019t disrupt your child\u2019s stability for her. She has a perfectly fine situation and it\u2019s not any of your concern that it makes her uncomfortable. NTA", "NTA this 100 percent. Plus the financial and mental strain of 4 kids.", "100% this!\n\nOP, you\u2019re still hurt of Mae\u2019s behavior & it didn\u2019t seem like it has honestly changed. Which you should be hurt by still. Now, she\u2019s blatantly using her support system. Especially if they aren\u2019t supporting her the way SHE EXPECTS to be treated. She\u2019s going to do the same thing with you. \n\nNTA. Please continue to keep your distance. Otherwise, nothing is going to change. You\u2019re still going to be used & feel that way.", "This also made me wonder if she feels safer dumping her kids on OP and disappearing again then to do it to her parents.", ">Exactly!", "[removed]", "Thats my thought too, that she will just abandon her kids", "It's about much more than bedrooms though. Does she work or have any source of income at all? Or was she planning for you to pay for all the food, do all the cooking, cleaning, pay all the utilities, and babysit her kids.", "Bot comment.
