My friends arrive and we quickly get to work in carrying my bedroom furniture out.

So as we're carrying out the furniture, my cousin tells us to take off our shoes. I'm pretty frustrated at this point because my friends and I are all tired - he was not helping us move even though I had agreed to help him pack/move on his moving day. My friends and I go back into the apartment to do some more heavy lifting (shoes on) and that's when everything explodes. He yells at us to take off our shoes and I tell him not to worry, as I will clean the apartment floors after I'm finished loading. \n\nNope. He refuses and yells again saying, \"I still live here! What do you want me to do - not use the living room/kitchen?\" I start yelling back that he can just chill in his room since he's not helping and that I do most of the cleaning for the apartment floor anyways. It got escalated into a huge fight about all the issues we had living with each other - mostly related to cleaning up after our dogs, dishes, floors.\n\nWe get along well with the occasional disagreement, but never like this. It ended with my cousin sulking in his bedroom as my friends and I move the rest of the stuff out with our shoes off like he requested. I left the apartment without saying anything to him and we haven't spoken since.

We also wouldn't, for example, ask the repair man who was there to inspect the HVAC system to take his shoes off. Your cousin needs to calm down.", "NTA.  No shoe policy here as well EXCEPT for something like moving.  I don't think it's a good idea to be lifting and moving heavy items while not wearing shoes anyway since they do offer some protection for your feet.", "NTA.  My guess is it has nothing to do with shoes and everything to do with how he feels about you moving out.  It is stressing to him so he exploded over something trivial.", "NTA! Literally dealt with this issue so many times. Seeing shoes worn inside my house makes me physically cringe but I've moved about 4 times too many to know its a whole hell of a lot easier to keep shoes on.", "NTA - it's unfeasible to take your shoes off every time and try to move the furniture out - then what, step out and put your shoes on while the furniture is being held up on the other end, move it five feet, and have the person in the back put their shoes on? Not only no, hell no.\n\nI'll say from experience that the booties are insanely slippery the times I've had to wear them. \n\nOnly other option might be putting down unfolded boxes and walking on them - assuming you have 20 or 30 huge boxes you don't mind breaking down.\n\nOtherwise? Time to mop/vacuum and consider it good.", "NTA - it sounds like your cousin has a serious case of OCD if he expects people to put their shoes on and off every time they move something through the house.", "It is extremely dangerous to move furniture barefoot and it should NEVER be done!\n\nNTA!", "NTA.  Sounds like you two needed to separate.  If you choose to help him, agree to clear rules or let him hire a mover.", "NTA - He overreacted and you said you would clean after (so no harm done).", "NTA. \nBut why are you helping your cousin move later? He did not help you move and made your move not only harder but unsafe. You should be wearing shoes, preferable sturdy toe covering shoes, whiling moving so you have good traction, stable footing, and if something happens your toes have some protection.", "NTA. \nLet your cousin arrange to move his own things out on his own if his rules are more important than anything else.", "NTA: It's unsafe to move heavy things with no shoes. Period. You can break your bones that way.", "NTA. If your going back and forth between the apartment and outside consistently it makes so sense to take your shoes off every single time you enter the apartment only to have to put them back on a few minutes later to leave. Plus you told him that you would clean afterwards which is a very easy, and effective solution to the problem of wearing shoes in the house for one day.", "NTA. And if you have dogs you can't really get too uptight about shoes.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nIf that's the agreement, then you abide by it unless you work it out ahead of time.\n\nIf not, you should have put down rugs or wear booties or find a way to move without shoes.", "I\u2019m stuck between YTA and ESH - you could\u2019ve put something on your shoes or spoken to your cousin instead of making a unanimous decision. \n\nA quick \u201chey dude, we are having a hard time with taking are shoes on and off, are you cool if we leave them on and then I\u2019ll make sure to clean the floors before we head out?\u201d Probably would\u2019ve solved your problem. \n\nAlso, is your cousin hurting regarding you leaving? After the big blowup and you mentioning their depression I would probably check in on them if you\u2019re okay with that. It was a dumb fight about shoes on in the apartment at the end of the day and doesn\u2019t need to continue escalating.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's unreasonable to expect movers to take off/put on shoes when moving. And you did offer to clean up afterwards.\n\nAnd I don't understand how he couldn't use the kitchen/living room; he could simply use shoes himself for the duration, esp since you said you would be cleaning afterwards anyway.\n\nSounds like there was a lot of resentment building up between the two of you. Are you sure you want to help him move if it will lead to more arguments? What if he insists on shoes off during the move?", "That\u2019s just ridiculous. Moving with shoes off it\u2019s really inconvenient and potentially dangerous.", "NTA, its dangerous to move heavy things without shoes anyway, you could damage your feet! He overly freaked out about this one incident, you didn't do anything wrong. If I were you I would be hard pressed to actually help him move out, might have to find something fun to do that day instead, lol", "NTA - I have a no shoe policy for my family, friends of my kids, and friends of mine that I\u2019m close with. I don\u2019t enforce it on acquaintances or workers as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something everyone in Western cultures is comfortable with, and prepared for when visiting. I don\u2019t want to embarrass them if their socks don\u2019t match, or they haven\u2019t gotten a pedi, or they have smelly feet, or whatever. If they offer, I take them up on it. BUT when moving you absolutely have to wear shoes for safety. Your cousin is being unreasonable.", "I second this. Shoes need to be worn when moving heavy furniture/equipment. Sliding around in socks and fumbling to put on shoes by the door is an accident waiting to happen.", "HVAC guy has booties he can wear if you ask...", "Ahhh I think you might be onto something there with the cousin, doesn't excuse his behaviour tho ofc", "Also, given his reaction, I don't think you're too obliged to help him move out anymore.", "The disposable booties are incredibly slippery, even the ones with tread on them. And either you change them every time creating waste, or wear them outside and back in again- completely defeating the purpose of wearing them in the first place.\n\nSounds like the lazy hothouse flower cousin will be stuck moving all his shit by himself. He deserves it.", "Sometimes they don't sometimes that don't. I bought a box of them just in case.", "First of all, not all booties are the same.  The kind I wore for the MRI, for example, you could practically rock climb in.  Yes, obviously, the slip-on paper ones shouldn't be used on hardwood with heavy objects.\n\nThis isn't about waste.  There are billions worldwide who don't wear OUTSIDE shoes in the house.  For situations that demand grip and foot protection, we wear INSIDE shoes that haven't been outside.  I mean, you can call billions of Chinese and Japanese and Koreans and Arabs \"hothouse flowers\"--which reeks of racism--or OP could have just talked to his friend before hand.\n\nI've also had pro movers (Graebel), put down sticky film all over my carpets so they could wear shoes, and not fuck anything up by stepping on anything in their work boots.\n\nThere are plenty of solutions.  Maybe be a bit less ethnocentrism, too, in your world view.\n\nPeople who traipse around in the house with their outdoor shoes are disgusting."]}
