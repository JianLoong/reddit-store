He did not help you move and made your move not only harder but unsafe.

If your going back and forth between the apartment and outside consistently it makes so sense to take your shoes off every single time you enter the apartment only to have to put them back on a few minutes later to leave.

It's unreasonable to expect movers to take off/put on shoes when moving.

The kind I wore for the MRI, for example, you could practically rock climb in.  Yes, obviously, the slip-on paper ones shouldn't be used on hardwood with heavy objects.\n\nThis isn't about waste.  There are billions worldwide who don't wear OUTSIDE shoes in the house.  For situations that demand grip and foot protection, we wear INSIDE shoes that haven't been outside.  I mean, you can call billions of Chinese and Japanese and Koreans and Arabs \"hothouse flowers\"--which reeks of racism--or OP could have just talked to his friend before hand.\n\nI've also had pro movers (Graebel), put down sticky film all over my carpets so they could wear shoes, and not fuck anything up by stepping on anything in their work boots.\n\nThere are plenty of solutions.

Both for practical reasons (it's incredibly inconvenient to take off and on your shoes all the time) and for safety reasons.

Either your cousin has other underlying stuff going on besides depression and anxiety (OCD or something idk, I'm not a mental health professional) or he's just stressed and/or upset about you moving and took it out on you like this.

For me it\u2019s about not wanting pesticides/fertilizer/car drippings, animal waste, etc in my home, and those things don\u2019t just cease to exist bc there\u2019s a good reason to keep your shoes on. If it\u2019s purely hardwood floors/tiles floors that can be thoroughly cleaned after the move, okay. But if there are rugs and carpet- it\u2019s still a frustration. \n\nI also see the issue with safety, the inconvenience of taking them off and on over and over, etc. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where shoe covers and laying down drop cloths/runners/cardboard comes in. Alternatively, you could wipe off the bottoms of your shoes well, and bring everything that needs to be moved as close to the door as possible before you start taking them outside to avoid tracking dirty shoes through the whole house over and over. \n\nI kind of see both sides, and I think you can make it work if you want to make it work.", "Not only do they not always have them, they can actually be dangerous too.

Let him find someone else to help him move.", "It's actually dangerous (also inefficient, but that's so far down the list) to move out without shoes. Not just for furniture, but all the boxes too. I have house slippers that have good traction, but I would never consider wearing those over good shoes with actual outdoor traction when it comes to moving. It's not even your feet that could be in the most danger, it's your knees and back.\n\nThe \"he still has to live here\" comment makes me think that he's not happy that you are both moving out. Maybe his anxiety over the situation made this worse for him, but that is something that you should talk out before you decide to cancel on helping with his move. Particularly because you mentioned that you were the main cleaner in your shared household. While you said that you will clean after your move, is he now thinking - \"who will clean when I move out and move into my new place? Oh no, who will clean my new place after the move? All those dirty shoes in my new place?\"\n\nI honestly hope he's in therapy. Whether it's separation from you or the inability to take care of moving related dirtiness that happens (and that you were going to take care of), this was an overreaction. Anxiety can take you over, but it's up to the person dealing with it to actually figure it out and **deal** with it.\n\nNTA and I hope that you and your cousin can figure this out.", "NTA.
