{"id": 12287, "submission_id": "11rflzk", "title": "AITA for reporting my classmates for joking that I have pretty privilege?", "selftext": "Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. \n\nAnyway:\n\nI did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that \"they had experience with that themselves\".\n\nI've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if \"my boyfriend\" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.\n\nThey didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn\u2019t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don\u2019t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.\n\nI raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors \"to remind them of proper conduct\" and described their treatment of an \"unnamed female student\". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their \u201csilly joke\u201c. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It\u2019s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.\n\nI now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship.

I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum, and choose to hang out with other people.\n\nAnyway:\n\nI did well in our recent exams (I topped two out four).

We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards I heard them in the hallway joking that \"they had experience with that themselves\". \n\nI've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if \"my boyfriend\" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I dont have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.\n\nThey didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn\u2019t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don\u2019t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.\n\nI raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia.

OP, they are literally accusing you of cheating. They hedge it by calling it a \"joke,\" but it's an accusation that you have to take seriously and nip it in the bud. These antics could cause you academic trouble down the road, so now is the time to make official reports.", "Same. I originally majored in physics and was one of 2 women in most of my classes. The guys formed study groups and got all buddy-buddy with each other, but either of us would get the cold shoulder if we tried to join in. I could only handle that shit for a year - switched to linguistics, which was pretty much a 50/50 split and an entirely different attitude. I wish I'd had the lovely backbone that OP has.", "Superscript happens when you put ^ and then something after it without a space in between, I suppose they used the symbol to censor the word", "I always go for the good ol \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to make jokes, but I get to decide if they are funny\u201d with these shitheads. Inevitably this causes a critical pissbaby meltdown.", "Fun fact, deserts aren't always sandy. The classification of a desert is based on annual precipitation, so the Arctic is a desert as it is too cold to snow there.", "It\u2019s also probably redeemable. At this moment in time C has a choice: continue down this route, lose scholarship or even get kicked off course if he keeps continuing to escalate it orrr he could use this as a wake up call, pick up a few books on feminism (and let\u2019s make it intersectional feminism whilst we\u2019re at it so he understands double or triple marginalisation), go to a feminist seminar\u2026. I\u2019d be pretty sure at this point YouTube would even have a \u2018why you shouldn\u2019t be sexist\u2019 video he could start with. He could then sincerely apologise for his actions and become an ally supporting OP and other women when other shitty guys are shitty. Young people following crowds do fucking stupid things, but at some point (and risking a scholarship really should do this) you have to look at yourself and question if you\u2019re really acting in a way you\u2019re proud of or if you want to strive to be better.\n\nBut 4chan is calling for this one I suspect\u2026.", "In the UK, universities and research institutes all apply to the  \"Athena Swan\" award scheme for what is basically a certificate in gender equality best practices. It's been tied to funding eligibility and that sort of thing. A lot of women in STEM fields have said it made a big difference to their working environment. I haven't been around long enough to notice a difference but I don't feel I've ever been treated differently at work because I am a woman, so something must be going right.", "Incorrect. You clearly don't understand that this is all part of their plans as criminal masterminds. \ud83d\ude42", "Other fun facts : deserts of sznd are called ergs. Deserts of rock are called regs. Useful words for crosswords.\n\nNo idea if there is a name for desert of ice.", "Some people just double down because changing their way, even without apologising, is practically admitting they're wrong, and in these people's heads, they can't be wrong. It's not OP's job to educate these people, but if they bother her again, the things you said are a good reply.", "sending you hugs! you got this x", "They are not \u201cjokers.\u201d They are misogynists displaying narcissistic behavior. Don\u2019t gloss over their behavior as just being \u201cjokers.\u201d Victims certainly don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a joke.", "yes WWII vets of both sexes were a really unique group of people. There are few left now, but I knew many of them. Most of the female vets had been nurses but there were a couple of pilots and a mechanic in that group. the men i knew were mainly pilots just because dad was Army Air Corps so that was who he knew.", "Came to say this. \n\n\u201cC shouldn\u2019t lose his scholarship over this\u201d??\n\nYes. Yes, he should. Harassment of a fellow student is exactly one of the reasons someone should lose a scholarship. Why should anyone pay for you to go to university when you\u2019re not emotionally or socially prepared for the experience? That\u2019s a waste of money.\n\nBehavior and attitude absolutely get taken into account when awarding scholarships. As well they should.\n\n*edit - an errant letter*", "Remind him that you were responding to his actions!", "Ye gads!!! I hope he lost his enlistment. I want to counter his abusive power move by stating I could beat him to within a heart beat of needing hospital and he can\u2019t do anything about it.", "Ugh\u2026 I\u2019m not saying other women might treat you differently, but what the heck?? \u201cSexism exists but it\u2019s WOMEN who are sexist against you\u201d is such a stupid and offensive take.\n\nI went to a women in engineering seminar, and one of the talks was about dress. Some of it was stupid, some sexist, but the woman did lay out statistics about how women\u2019s attractiveness changes their perceived intelligence. The conclusion was too much makeup is bad, too little is bad, just a little bit of mascara and coverup was ideal. Clothes that are too tight or too baggy or too colorful or too drab make people think you\u2019re less capable. Not even intentionally, just first impression unconscious thoughts.", "I\u2019m sorry you had to endure such experiences too. Unfortunately it\u2019s all too common in the military for women to be assaulted or harassed. It took my years to overcome it and I\u2019ve found that sharing my story gives me the power back.", " I they didn\u2019t have my consent. They reported it because it made them uncomfortable to watch that exchange.", "He was an E-7 and was busted down to an E-4. Lost his teaching position, and was quickly gone. Had already completed most of his 20 years so he lost his retirement. The worst part, I worked for his ex-wife. She was just as miserable as him.", "I really hope you mean ex-friend.  Because gross.", "Congrats on your book, it sounds awesome! I hope you keep on writing to rub their noses in it. And why are you still friends?", "Honestly it's better that it's happening *now*, in college, than later once they've weaseled their way into management positions with the power to harass and professionally handicap more women. As of now they still have time to learn from the situation and correct their behavior going forward (unlikely, in which case they absolutely deserve whatever karma comes their way), and OP is tackling this early on before it gets worse for her.   \n\n\nI was in the Army and struggled so hard to be taken seriously once I earned my Sgt stripes because I was a woman and therefore could have only earned my rank on my back. Ugh, *men\\**.  \n\n\n^(\\*Obligatory #notallmen but seriously y'all need to have a chat with your brothers because they're making y'all look bad)", "No but only women get emotional!

But glad your associates and 2 years gave you the experience necessary to take credit for my solution....."]}
