Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum, and choose to hang out with other people.\n\nAnyway:\n\nI did well in our recent exams (I topped two out four). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards I heard them in the hallway joking that \"they had experience with that themselves\". \n\nI've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if \"my boyfriend\" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I dont have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.\n\nThey didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn\u2019t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don\u2019t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.\n\nI raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors \"to remind them of proper conduct\" and described their treatment of an \"unnamed female student\". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their \u201csilly joke\u201c. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It\u2019s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that. \n\nI now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship.

The boys are reacting in a defensive manner but maybe they'll think twice before behaving like assholes toward the next woman.", "NTA. You\u2019ve had to deal with too much bullshit as it is. They weren\u2019t going to stop because you asked nicely. You deserve your place in the course and they can go fuck then selves.", "NTA. They were explicitly trying to hurt you in the program by making these comments around the professors, trying to belittle you and suggest to everyone that you don't deserve any success you have. They absolutely deserve to be called out on this. \n\nIt was not just a \"silly joke\" but (whether spawned by jealousy, misogyny, or whatever) was open sexual harassment.", "NTA. They need to be called out on their misogynistic BS. Facing the consequences might eventually teach them to be better, or at least to treat their female classmates/colleagues better.", "Definitely NTA. What they are doing is sexist and bullying. It's not \"your fault\" when C loses his scholarship, but his for behaving this way. It's so important to speak up and you did nothing wrong. Sure, you could have confronted them directly, but with them being the majority they probably wouldn't have taken you seriously anyways.", "\"silly jokes\" involve everyone having fun, but what they've been doing to you can easily be described as harassment. This is happening because of their actions, you've done nothing wrong. \n\nNTA", "NTA. These misogynists effed around and found out. They will take this behavior into the work place if left unchecked. good on you and your professor for calling them out.", "NTA.  They were insanely jealous and we're acting like second graders.", "NTA they were bullying you, trying to undermine your success and label you an accessory to a male PHD student. They needed to have a wake up call. They need to treat you with respect. Don\u2019t feel bad about any of it.", "NTA. AT ALL. DO NOT RELENT. They deserve worse. These are not jokes - this is harassment. They are so intimidated by you that they cannot cope.\n\nDo a presentation on white male privilege. They'd all lose their stupid little boy minds.\n\nEdit: your friend sucks.\n\nEdit 2: in your presentation, you can add info about all of the many \"hidden figures\" (such as women) if the history of your field, and the work they did that men have taken credit for.", "NTA - if making a \u201csilly joke\u201d is enough to lose him his scholarship then perhaps he should think about whether it\u2019s so \u201csilly\u201d after all.\n\nThey know they\u2019re harassing you. They\u2019re expecting to get away with it. And they\u2019re really being dealt with very gently here: in a lot of places that kind of behaviour, especially with it being done in front of staff, would get them suspended from their studies pending an investigation.\n\nThe guy who might lose his scholarship is trying to guilt trip you into changing your report instead of thinking about what he did and the consequences (to himself, if if he can\u2019t manage to think what it does to you and your wellbeing) and amending his behaviour accordingly. So he\u2019s indicating that he and his friends don\u2019t feel any responsibility for their actions.\n\nThat being the case, you should feel no responsibility for the consequences of showing others how they are behaving.", "NTA. They were pretty much harassing you because you're a girl and you're a pretty girl. Maybe they'll think twice about making \"silly\" jokes.", "NTA. Their actions caused this reaction. They need to own up to them. It is unreasonable to think they can openly disparage you because of your gender and not have any consequences. Maybe they should think twice before discriminating against someone.", "NTA.  These idiots are harassing you to try and get you to quit the program because they feel threatened by you.  \n\nAs a dude myself, not one time has my ego ever been so fragile  that I harassed someone because I felt threatened somehow.\n\n I maintain the position that if you\u2019re better than me (male or female) in academics or some other relevant field, good for you!  I can learn from you and improve my own ability and knowledge\u2026but you are also going to have to work hard to stay ahead of me. \n\nFinally, my parents are both university professors.  On more than one occasion, they have dropped people from their fields of study for harassment of this type.\n\nIf their supervisors and advisers are being cold to them, that should be setting off giant alarm bells in their tiny little minds that they\u2019re in very present danger of being dropped from their field of study or from the institution altogether\u2026and if they lose their financial packages, that\u2019s on them for being dumbasses.", "NTA - Harassment, bullying call it what you will there is a reason that women struggle to thrive in academia. It's appalling and these people bought it on themselves. Keep standing up to bullys and harassment.", "NTA", "NTA they are harassing you for no reason except jealousy. It may be that ribbing one another and one upping is a form of bonding for them, but you\u2019ve made it quite clear it\u2019s unwelcome. Keep documenting everything and keep your supervisor and any mentors in the loop.\n\nYou\u2019re doing amazing, don\u2019t let these chuckle dicks get you down.", "Don\u2019t ever apologize for people who try and fail to bring you down", "NTA. Those guys are being absolutely disgusting. They\u2019re bullies and misogynists.", "If their \u201cpretty privilege joke\u201d made you lose out on a scholarship or caused you to be graded extra hard, they wouldn\u2019t give it a crap. They intentionally and repeatedly made this \u201csilly joke\u201d out loud, in front of professors. \n\nNTA. Maybe they should have thought about treating you with respect and professionalism BEFORE it had to come from a place of authority.", "NTA, if misogynists want to be awarded scholarships then they should be quieter \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. What a bunch of dicks.", "NTA. Stand your ground girl. These men are threatened by you.", "NTA for reporting it to supervisor or whatever they deserve that much but it might be too far if one looses a scholarship because of it", "NTA. They can't get away with this kind of shit.", "NTA - they were pressing it just as far as they thought they could get away with.  Once is a joke.  This was a campaign.", "Anything that happens is as a direct result of their words and actions. \n\nIf they do not want people to know about their behaviour, then they shouldn't behave in that fashion. \n\nActions have consequences. It's not hard to understand.", "NTA, as someone who works and has taught in higher education. Not at all. It sounds like they\u2019re in the wrong field if they are going to behave that way, and should recognize that.", "NTA\n\nThey're harassing you, plain and simple. \n\nIf they lose their financial aid its because of their own actions, not yours.  You should be proud of yourself for standing up to their bullying.\n\nEdit: damn you autocorrect!", "Can confirm the value of fire-forging. Stay strong, u/Maleficent-Day4476.", "They *wanted* to get reprimanded and possibly lose financial aid?", "its mainly my awesome supervisor - probs wouldn't have been supported by one of the many old men in the faculty", "This whole thing sounds like something that would happen in Elementary school. I honestly just kinda find it hard to believe that people (the friend group) over the age of 20 still act like this.", "Gross", "Oh look, here is one of those guys. \ud83d\ude02 She is NTA. She earned her grades and does not deserve that type of aggression.", "bro she was literally being harassed.", "So tell us - who are you? A? B? or C?\n\nOP - NTA", "NTA, please make misogynists quieter if they wish to receive scholarships.", "Sorry, are you serious?", "????? Is this sarcasm? If not.. what privileges do you think she has that she\u2019s deflecting? And how are they related to the gender-based harassment she\u2019s experiencing from her classmates?", "If I was in a class and someone did a whole presentation about how I am \"privileged\" bc of an aspect of being a minority, they are an asshole.\n\nOP scored well on those tests and would have no matter how she looked, I'm guessing. I'm also guessing you think the harassers are the \"victims\" here too huh?", "Agree completely with you! Been working in a male dominated field for almost my whole career and I still get 'you don't know what it's like on site' and 'those aren't the regulations' even when I can point to the exact part of the legislation where it says that they are wrong/incompetent.\n\nI've been asked if I slept my way into jobs, if my dad has anything to do with my career (he's a retired pub owner) and been asked if I was 'grumpy' because I was pregnant. No, I'm telling you to stop doing what you are doing because you are putting people in literal danger and need to stop it right now, I am more qualified than you. I could go on for hours with the bullshit weak men have tried to pull on me over the years. There are good ones who don't take it and stand up for me, ones that would never treat me that way but the bad ones are LOUD. \n\nThe only way to deal with misogyny is to shut it right down. This behaviour is not acceptable, and won't be tolerated in the workplace of any reputable company, their clients, or customers. Definitely document anything, and report to your professor that they confronted you about it and are blaming you for their actions (and reasonable consequences) now too and it is creating a hostile environment.\n\nNTA", ">NTA.  Their \u201cjokes\u201d and behaviors are harassment.\n\nIf OP is in the US, this is a clear Title 9 violation, including retaliation from the students she reported.\n\nu/Maleficent-Day4476 \\-- Title 9 might be something to keep on your radar if it continues, or if the other professors fail to step in and stop the behavior.", "That doesn\u2019t work. They\u2019ll just sexualize her further.", "This is very true go back to your advisor if they retaliate in anyway! Keep standing strong you\u2019re awesome!", "Also I commend your courage in defending yourself. That takes tenacity!", "NTA. Maybe they should smile more so they can get in on some of that pretty privilege. \n\n~~on another note, OP, from a femme presenting person in engineering - keep on keeping on, and don't let the bastards grind you down~~", "> benadryl\n\nDamn you autocarrot!", "Most likely because she has lived it and been ignored or told she was making trouble. Keep making waves, that is the only way things change", "they're highly intelligent in an academic sense, but their emotional IQ is 0. basically, they've always been the smartest in every room until now. very common type to encounter at my college tbh", "These two replies made me laugh much harder than they should have. Autocorrect is always good for a laugh.", "Not all heroes wear cakes!", "It has nothing to do with emotional IQ. They think you are not as smart or capable because you are female. That the only reason you could have done well is because a male student helped you.  This isn\u2019t ok and this incredible misogyny should be called out.  They deserve to be treated as the small minded people they are by their supervisors.", "You\u2019ll encounter this same bullshit in industry (28f in aviation engineering with engineering degree). Report it. Don\u2019t feel bad about it. It\u2019s harassment. Keep a paper trail always. NTA at all.", "How old are they? A male brain should've fully developed by the age of 23.", "There\u2019s a really fun account floating around here called something like u/IMessUpCommonPhrases if you wanna see more of that!", "Ohh, I didn't know about this.
