You might get a measure of gratification by telling your parents you're skipping the holiday with them because you honestly can't stand the way they treated you growing up. But maybe it would be even more fun to tell them that you can't join them for the holiday because you have high-level business trips to make for negotiations and other types of transactions that would be far too complex to explain to them. You can keep that one going for years while they writhe in frustration. Doesn't that sound better than telling them you're going to stay home on the weekend and enjoy your pizza and beer? Also, make sure that your finances are ironclad, because no doubt, they are now expecting you to support them in their old age. You can donate your money to charities that benefit girls.", "NTA.

Or are you anticipating that that will be the expectation when they get older? You don't have to make a statement about not supporting them if it hasn't come up yet but you could tell them, if the future comes up, you have a ten-year plan to be able to travel a bit, save for your own home, etc., which should clue them into the idea that taking care of them is not going to happen. \n\nAs for going home for Christmas, if you find pleasure in your brothers' company then it would be nice to visit for their sake.
