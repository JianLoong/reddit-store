And have a merry Christmas.  Without your parents.", "Uuuuh 100 percent NTA. Holidays alone or with a friend are so relaxing. When I moved out of state my first holiday I spent by myself and I ordered a precooked turkey and sides from a local restaurant and then spent the next few days in my pajamas watching movies and heating up whatever I wanted to eat whenever I wanted to eat it. It was literally the best. \n\nTake the time off and enjoy being lazy/relaxed! Don't even tell them you have extra time off.\n\nETA:  you have no obligation to show up to anything you don't want to.

You might get a measure of gratification by telling your parents you're skipping the holiday with them because you honestly can't stand the way they treated you growing up. But maybe it would be even more fun to tell them that you can't join them for the holiday because you have high-level business trips to make for negotiations and other types of transactions that would be far too complex to explain to them. You can keep that one going for years while they writhe in frustration. Doesn't that sound better than telling them you're going to stay home on the weekend and enjoy your pizza and beer? Also, make sure that your finances are ironclad, because no doubt, they are now expecting you to support them in their old age. You can donate your money to charities that benefit girls.", "NTA. Could you show face for a meal and tell a white lie that you have to get back to London for work? Then get drunk and have pizza guilt-free. Either way,\nNTA.", "NTA Sounds like OP needs a new family.

Since you\u2019ve got time off, why not go somewhere warm, and have fancy pizza and really good wine on a beach?", "Lots to unpack there. You're young to be worried about supporting your parents as they age. Are they retired or disabled and cannot take care of themselves right now? Or are you anticipating that that will be the expectation when they get older? You don't have to make a statement about not supporting them if it hasn't come up yet but you could tell them, if the future comes up, you have a ten-year plan to be able to travel a bit, save for your own home, etc., which should clue them into the idea that taking care of them is not going to happen. \n\nAs for going home for Christmas, if you find pleasure in your brothers' company then it would be nice to visit for their sake. I've done Christmas alone and it wasn't great.", "Put on your cozy clothes keep a cooler next to you. So you don\u2019t have to get up so much. Sleep when you get sleepy and get up when you feel like it. Do not pay attention to the time at all. \nI was suppose to be a boy. My mom constantly told me what a failure I would be.

I always feel like people pity me for not spending Christmas with my family but as I\u2019ve gotten older I can barely spend a weekend there without it becoming toxic, I\u2019m glad other people realise it\u2019s better to do what you want alone than force yourself into uncomfortable family situations!", "I\u2019m not gonna!

Ha ha!\n\nSeriously - you do you.  Order your favorite pizza, chill a couple bottles of your favorite wine, put on your comfiest pajamas and enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!\n\nAs far as your crappy family- tell them you will not be able to make it, them immediately turn off your phone and ignore it during your time off.  Of course they will text and call but don't pick up, don't read and don't respond until your holiday break is over.  No is a complete sentence.\n\nAfterwards, when and if you decide to resume contact, do it on your terms.  \"Gee dad, can't talk now!  You are yelling too much and my cell phone is blanking you out.  Call me later!\"  Or \"No can do.  I am not able to help finance that for you - rent is a pretty penny here in the big city!\"  Or \"Gosh, I am frightfully busy and just cannot take a weekend to visit!  Gotta run!\"  Notice you are not apologizing, nor are you lying.  And you terminate the conversation the second they start meandering into abusive territory.\n\nYou do not owe them your time or your money. You do not owe them your love or your loyalty.  They have proven they are not worthy of you.  You can tell them that too - \"Gee maybe I would be more willing to play happy family with you if you hadn't chosen to beat me and abuse me for not being a boy.  You do know, dad, that males provide the chromosome that determines either a child is a male or a female right?  So you hating me all of my life is really an indictment of your own failures as a man!\" Then hang up and let them stew.\n\nHave a happy holiday and NTA!", "How about a nice trip to Spain or Portugal on those days?", "This is the way. :) I hope your holiday is everything you hope and dream it will be and then some!", "I\u2019m gonna be so comfy! Netflix and chill and pizza by myself, maybe even a facemask for some self care!", "There\u2019s a rom com on Netflix called \u201cset it up\u201d that not many people saw and it\u2019s adorable. Highly recommend!", "Go for it!  And don\u2019t answer their phone calls!", "You should buy one of those crochet blankets that look like a  mermaid tail. I bought one for myself and I f'n love it. It's so cozy and is perfect for a night on the couch watching movies.", "Buy yourself some presents and put them aside until Christmas too. I do this every year \ud83d\ude42.", "Definitely on my watchlist now", "Off topic, but would it appeal to non-romcom fans?\n\nAlso, OP, please pamper yourself. If people judge you for not spending time with an abusive family, then it reflects poorly on them, not you.", "It has a 92 on Rotten tomatoes! For a romcom it\u2019s like if it won an Oscar. You won\u2019t regret it. Have fun!", "OMG two words: Christmas Prince. They're also on Netflix and they're FABULOUS", "I wouldn\u2019t know, it\u2019s such a rom-com! But the actors are good, it\u2019s well written, it\u2019s smart, kinda funny. Check the trailer and see for yourself! It\u2019s a feel good movie for sure."]}
