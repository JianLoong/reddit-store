I (19 female) stay with two roommates Jenna (20 female) and Sevval (21 female) in a college dorm. Two days ago, i was studying for a midterm in the morning and Jenna was in a rush and getting ready because she was late for her midterm and our other roommate wasn't in the room.\n\nWhile i was studying i had a strange nose bleed and felt dizzy. I informed her about the nosebleed and she ignored me. When i was going to bathroom to check it, i fainted. She was still in the room when the incident happened. When i woke up, our other roommate Sevval and dorm staff were trying to wake me up. We ended up in colleges emergency room and i was informed that there was no serious problem.\n\nOn our way back to our room, we were talking about the incident and Sevval mentioned that she was so scared when she found me like that. I asked her what does she mean by finding me like that because since she wasn't in the room, i thought Jenna informed her about the situation. She told me that she had no idea about the situation and when she came to room she saw me like that and called the dorm office to help me.\n\nI was so confused and kinda pissed but i wanted to ask Jenna anyways. I waited for her to come to room back. When she came, i asked her if she called anyone to help me or if she informed anyone nearby to take care of the situation. She said that she was in a rush and it didn't seem like a big problem for her so it wasn't worth to retake the exam (She can retake the exam because there is a proven emergency).\n\nI was so angry so i yelled at her for leaving me like that and there may be a serious problem since i have no disease can cause nose bleed and fainting. Even though i had one, leaving a fainted person like that is a messed up thing to do. She could have just call the dorm office or anyone else to help me on her way to exam. She told me that im an asshole for expecting her to miss the exam and yelling at her over it but I don't think i am.
