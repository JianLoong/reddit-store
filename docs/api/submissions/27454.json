She's not allergic, she's trying to avoid them. If she was that bothered, she should have asked you what was in them before she stuffed her face with them.\n\nNo more treats for auntie. Also, please share the recipe. I love brownies.", "NTA. \n\n1. You're not a mind reader or a time traveler. There was no way you could have known she was anti-egg at the moment.\n2.

Oh, please. \n\nAnyway, if you are on some kind of \"diet\" it's on you to ask if food includes stuff you avoid.\n\nNTA and make sure not to bake for your aunt's family any more", "NTA - Your aunt is weird for freaking out.", "NTA. You're not a mind reader. If she has new dietary constraints, she needs to tell people about them.", "NTA\n\nIf your aunt is on a special diet, it's her responsibility to ask about the ingredients before eating.\n\nHow could she assume your cake was eggless ? I think a few baking lessons wouldn't do her any harm. Eggs are usually the first thing you mix with sugar to make a nice moist cake. Your brownie must have been delicious and surely her guilty pleasure.", "NTA. If she was avoiding eggs she should have let you all know that ahead of time. And I don't know why she was shocked that brownies have egg in them. That's on her.", "NTA. You didn't know. She was the one who didn't mention it and knows what is in most baked goods.", "NTA - When a kid makes you brownies, you say thank you.  Whether or not you want to eat them, you say thanks.  If you have a dietary restriction, you should not expect a young teen to keep up with that.  You're the adult, you monitor your own foods.", "NTA.\n\nyour aunt can change her diet any time. but she is an ass for expecting the world to revolve around her plans. she is introducing everyone to her change of diet at the meeting for the first time. she might just not want to admit that she likes the brownies, which from what you said, sound delicious. please share the recipe for the brownies.\n\ndont bother about her. sometimes you have to keep your relatives at arm's distance. nice diplomatic play by your cousin though.", "She's nuts.\n\nOf course brownies are likely to have eggs.. and she even knew the recipe, and she's blaming you?  Nope.\n\nThat's all on herself.  \n\nYer NTA", "Good grief.  If going for a meal somewhere and you've changed your diet say so before turning up, not after eating the food!   I don't bake but I do know nearly everything has eggs.  Why eat then say oh by the way I don't eat eggs anymore.", "Your aunt wins the title of AH. She knows the recipe, she enjoyed the treat, waited until AFTER eating and complimenting your efforts to throw a fit.

Brownies have eggs if she didn't ask before eating that was her problem. Dont feel bad", "How can  you be in the wrong if you didn't know.  She should make the effort to tell and remind that she doesn't eat eggs.\n\nAnd out of interest - why is she now not eating eggs?  Is she allergic?  Are eggs causing problems / irritations?  In what way are they poisoning her?\n\nThis problem is on her for not telling you or your parents.", "Can I get the recipe for your awesome brownie? Is it shared elsewhere?

Brownie recipes typically include eggs, so she had no reason to think that this one wouldn't.

If it was important to your aunt that she not eat eggs, it was her responsiblity to inquire about the ingredients in the food that she was choosing to eat.", "NTA. Honey, you didn't know. They'd already been baked before she said anything. Your aunt is just acting crazy.", "NTA This is the stupidest shit in the world. If you're on a diet you don't eat brownies and ice cream.", "NTA.  Your aunt failed to tell you about the change in her diet *before* she ate the brownies.  She's blaming you for not being able to read her mind.\n\nNew policy for when your aunt is over either say, \"Before I give you some I need to know if there is a change in your diet\" or, even better, don't give her any and when she complains/asks why she wasn't given anything tell her that you didn't know if her diet had changed and you didn't want to be blamed for giving her something that goes against her new diet so you chose to err on the side of caution and not give her anything.", "Most baked goods use eggs or something related to eggs. Your aunt even knows this receipe so she knew they had eggs in it.\n\nShe didn't announce her diet until after she had eaten dinner. Not only did her dessert contain eggs, it's very likely that other dinner foods did as well. Was everybody trying to 'poison' her?\n\nContact your aunt and tell her that now that you know about her 'diet', you won't bake for her ever again. Tell her that the onus is on her to do due diligence and check the ingredients of everything she eats. I bet that she is uniformed about what foods actually contain eggs.", "NTA. \nIt was so sweet of you to bake for everyone! \nIf it was so important to her she could have asked. Common sense is brownies have eggs.", "OP should go read the ingredients list for the ice cream as well.\n\nWhat rando diet allows brownies and ice cream but not eggs anyway? Made up drama.", "Eggs are also very common in baked goods - you'd think you'd ask if you were on such a diet.", "\\^this, NTA.\n\nYour aunt is being a bully, and I wouldn't even make the effort to cook without eggs on her account, just tell her when she next comes that she can't have whatever it is because it's got eggs in it.", "Only the really good ones", "Only in Custard", "I was coming to say exactly this! \ud83e\udd23 Eggs are a no, but brownies are fine???\nNTA.

Lol", "Yup.  Hey look at me!", "What's the point in eating any other kind than really good ice cream?", "Yep, exactly. You don't eat shit and then tell you decided to skip some products coz of a diet, lol", "truth! I make my own."]}
