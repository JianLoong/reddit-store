OP was not.\n\nAnd you genuinely believe that OP thought this was specific to upstairs? Like for some reason upstairs was off limits somehow that had nothing to do with the two of them being alone together while people were there? What she didn\u2019t want was for them to retreat into a one-on-one hangout. \n\n> OP & bf decided to watch the movie (put on by OP\u2019s mom), the door was open, they were sitting next to each other (as COUPLES do), they even made conversation with those who walked in.\n\n**If that\u2019s the case, then that changes the judgement.**\n\n**Mom putting on a movie / okaying the movie was not in the initial post.**\n\n**If you\u2019re going to call me upset, don\u2019t get upset yourself that I haven\u2019t read every comment.** \n\n> It is COMPLETELY normal for kids/teens to not want to be involved in adult conversations, leading them to do their own thing & guess what, there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nFor sure. Except it seems clear that mom was hesitant to let bf be there because she anticipated exactly that.\n\n> pls be civil", "LMAO I'm gonna go with it's Mom!", "NTA. What the heck did your mother want from you? Don't go upstairs. Don't sit in the living room. Were you supposed to dress up and wait on people hand and foot? Put on some kind of show to entertain them? I'm honestly baffled here.\n\nAs long as you two weren't actively making out and all over each other, which would have been disrespectful at a family gathering regardless of gender, I don't see how you did anything wrong.", ">You're good! Your Mom however...maybe find ways to gently probe potential homophobia going on there.\n\nNot to invalidate this, but surely a subconsciously homophobic parent wouldn't want the couple mingling with the family downstairs and would prefer them to be off somewhere. \n\nI can 100% understand the feeling of family members being uncomfortable to just walk into a room where a teenage couple of any orientation is watching a movie... if you've never met the SO it can feel like you're intruding, plus teenage couples tend to be especially coupley if you get me.", "It really depends. My mom's family and ex gf's family would say they didn't mind us over together for different holiday stuff (actively inviting us as a couple to events).\n\nBut then different (always 40+) people from our respective families would still actively avoid talking to us, at least as a couple, while if we were one on one with those same people it was fine. Her mom even asked us to make sure certain family members didn't see us sit next to each other.\n\nSo we were hearing one thing from our families, and they didn't mind us being there, just some of them didn't want to interact with us unless we did it one on one with the people who felt uncomfortable.\n\nSometimes acceptance is just performative.", "OP literally said there was movies going and they were sitting the living room...In your eyes this means no, but yet you still said they were entangled previously...So which one do you think it is? Lol", ">Sometimes acceptance is just performative.\n\nExactly. It's really sad when that happens."]}
