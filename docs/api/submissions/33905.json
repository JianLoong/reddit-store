Now you know for next time that you\u2019re expected to socialise a bit more actively. No harm done.\n\nYou were spending time with your boyfriend, you chatted when prompted, you did nothing wrong and didn\u2019t commit a social faux pas, you just didn\u2019t act in the way your mum was expecting of you.\n\nSure you could have engaged more, but you weren\u2019t an asshole for not doing so. You weren\u2019t rude in any way.", "NTA.  Damned if you did, damned if you didn't.  She wanted you downstairs per her own words then got mad you stayed there?", "NTA, she should have been clearer and if you misunderstood she should have quietly cleared it up with you", "NTA. Is your mom always toxic like this about other stuff? She sounds absolutely insane! \n\nShe could have absolutely come into the living room and told you to scoot over or that you guys could go spend some time in your room! Sounds like she needs some therapy!", "NTA. You were present and chatted with some of them. Your mum probably wanted you to be more active in conversation but she sucks at communicating.", "YTA. Common, your story could fit in the MaliciousCompliance sub, don't you see it ? You agreed and respected your mom's demand to the letters, not the spirit. She wanted you to be present and engaging with the family.\n\nDid you try to engage a conversation? To join a chat ? Did you stop the movies when someone was coming and chatting with you ? Or by \"chatting\" , did you mean that you just answered some random question from family  member then let the conversation dry out and turned again your attention to the TV ? \n\nHonestly I feel that it would have been better if you two went one hour in your bedroom and doing whatever but spending the rest of the time by being really present with your family.\n\nAnd yes, when a couple (specially a new/young couple) take the main couch and watch movies together, it does make the whole vibe of the room different and uncomfortable.", "I'm between NAH and ESH. I think it was a miscommunication. I'm also autistic so I tend to take things quite literally which led to arguments with my mom growing up, as in my mind I was following instructions, but she thought I was trying to be a smart ass. Your mom could've easily knocked on the door and said \"hey guys, we miss you out here. Mind if we join you? Want to play a game with us?\" I don't think you meant to isolate yourself or make anyone else feel unwelcome. You're both 17, you're not necessarily going to want to be there for adult conversation.", "Light YTA, yes. You clearly don't handle socialization so well (yet). \n\nWhen you are at a social event, you are supposed to mingle with people. That means, every now and then, you'll go talk to someone else, move somewhere else, invite someone else in. Now and then = every 10mn to 1h. This way people can freely move from activity to activity, as things progress. \n\nIn that case, you both made a little bubble and, while technically obeying your Mom, made it hard for people to join in. Especially since it's socially rude to cut off someone watching a movie. And you literally watched SEVERAL. If no one sat off to join, that means you didn't make it socially welcoming. \n\nOthers will say your Mom could have cut you off. It's true, but it places the burden on her to be rude, risk a conflict, on top of everything else she was managing.", "NTA, and people assigning malice (yes, I know it\u2019s referring to a sub, but malicious compliance requires you to WILLFULLY act like an AH in revenge) seem to miss that you don\u2019t even know what you did wrong. Frankly, neither do I, but that may be bc I\u2019m too autistic to give much credence to people getting mad about their own lack of communication around unspoken social rules.", "ESH. This is malicious compliance, you didn't have to stay downstairs for the whole day and I don't think anyone would expect you to. But at the same time your mum could have said something at any time.", "ESH Your mum could have communicated better. \n\nWhen your family come over for Christmas, you interact with them. Ask Aunty Bea what her favourite hymn is to sing. Ask Uncle Rupert for advice about tying his tie. Start a board game with your twin cousins Samuel and Samantha. Make something up.\n\nDon\u2019t sit in the loungeroom playing footsies with your boyfriend all day.
