With that out of the way, I was on the phone with my sister(25f) while our mom was present with me, fuming. I told him that I am sorry he is having financial difficulties, but they aren\u2019t my responsibility. He then tried to call me, I ignored him because I know what he was about to do. He would not let me talk and would just yell at me through the phone. Yelling or raising of voices are a trigger for my anxiety, so I wanted to avoid going into a panic attack.\n\nHe texted me to answer my phone and then called me again. I ignored him again. He then sent me a lot of very degrading and hurtful text messages that sent me in to a panic and made me feel so shitty about myself. He called me ungrateful and disrespectful, held the fact that he did his job as a parent(home, food, clothes, etc.) and said I walk all over people who have helped me achieve my goals. That didn\u2019t get to me though. He had asked me to hang out with my brother that weekend and told me to not even bother with coming over.\n\nThen he told me we are done and uninvited me to his wedding. Told me that I will not be covered under his health insurance. By the last text I was sobbing, shaking and struggling to breathe. I have always felt like I had to fight for his love, affection and time.\n\nThis happened back in February and it\u2019s almost been an entire month since I have heard from my dad. My nana is on his side and told me I should amend my taxes and ask for some money out of it, but I have a strong feeling that he wouldn\u2019t give me anything.\n\nWhile living in his home I paid him $200 in rent every month, had a lot of housework on my shoulders, babysat my siblings (I would cancel plans sometimes if they couldn\u2019t get my nana to do it) on top of working and school. I got burnt out and moved back in with my mom before Christmas.\n\nI don\u2019t feel bad about standing my ground, but I\u2019m sad thinking about what he\u2019ll potentially miss out on if this continues.

But you have to prove that you provide over half their support and they live with you over half the year etc.", "NTA. Drop him and drop that entire toxic family.

He shouldn't be relying on you to help fund his wedding anyway. I do understand that being cut out of one of your parents lives is hard (my dad cut me out of his life for approx 5 years due to another family member telling lies to him, during this time he missed out on his first granddaughter being born and the first years of her life) but if he really loves you then he will come back into your life (it might take him months or even years but if he really loves you he will come back) when it happens it's then your choice if you are willing to let bygones be bygones or if you want to say sorry to little to late.", "NTA sounds like your dad has a lot of growing up to do maybe that's one reason him and your mom aren't together anymore", "Are you supporting yourself? If you are, then the IRS probably wouldn't even allow him to claim you as a dependent. And, if he is willing to disown you over $2000, then he would have eventually found another reason.

Your mother should be stepping in here. Will she be able to put you on her insurance?", "They changed the federal rules a few years ago. Instead of a deduction for each member of your family, there is a credit. It is 2000 per child under 18, or under 23 if the child is in college. He may have thought he would get a 2000 credit for you but you aged out of that credit unless you are in college. If you lived with him full time and earned less than 4400.00 he can get a 500$ credit claiming you. It sounds like you didn't meet that test. When my daughter turned 22 and was still in college ( 2020-covid money year) we realized she would get way more money claiming herself than we would get claiming her, so that's what we did. The money we would have gotten would have been put towards her college anyway, so her getting more helped us all.", "You should send your grandmother some of those horrible messages he was sending you, ask her what kind of father says stuff like this to his own child?

I know it hurts, but it's also the best possible outcome given the kind of lying jerk he is.  \n        \nAnd kudos to you for being so organized, productive, and self-sufficient at such a young age.

NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry they're all like this, but (as I've said a few times lately) this was inevitable. Especially as he keeps changing his tune. He was going to catch you in one of his logical traps eventually. I'm sorry about the health insurance, I hope you have a back up plan there. But sounds like a clean break is best. And don't feel bad about what he'll miss, he's made it clear he doesn't care. Which sucks to hear but I think you need to really take that in and take it to heart.

What about if he was drunk driving and asked you to do it because as a first-time offender, you wouldn't serve jail time?\n\nThese are extreme examples but to make the point. If your dad is willing to lose your relationship over 2k, then it wasn't a good relationship to begin with. He will always find a reason to hold your relationship with him as ransom. Get into therapy. Hear this from a professional. \n\nMake it clear to your nana, or whoever you have a relationship with, that he's committing a crime by claiming you on his taxes, and that's not okay. But if he doesn't want to have a relationship with you over this, that's his choice. But, you won't bail him out when he needs help in the future. He won't be at your future wedding. He won't be a grandparent to your future kids. If he's making this decision, you're free. You NEVER need to keep trying to have a relationship with this guy.", "How nice to feel that 2 grand isn't a lot of money \ud83d\ude44", "2,000 is the child tax credit.

Yes, it's a nice chunk of change, but when compared to the expenses *he* mentioned using that money for, it's nothing.\n\nA water heater replacement will cost at least $2000+tax in most cases. No matter how frugal the wedding, you aren't getting both out of that money he just screwed his relationship with his daughter over.", "No kidding. I get that disowning a kid over 2k is stupid and very absurd. You can't put a price on a relationship.\n\nBut it definitely is not a small amount of money. That is a huge amount to lose out on and could devastate someone who really needed it\n\nThat said, OP is NTA.

I don't know why I didn't consider federal.", "If dad paid 51%+ of living expenses, he would be entitled to claim op as a dependent.

OP is 19, not a student and not permanently disabled. Her dad would be committing tax fraud by claiming her.", "Well again that all depends on circumstances. In OP\u2019s it\u2019s a small amount.", "It is a lot. If I spent 2k on my wife's birthday gift, she would kill me, maybe even literally.
