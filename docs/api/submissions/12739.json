I was honest and told him that I did and reminded him that he told me I could claim myself this tax season. He said that he meant for 2023 taxes and then went on to say how he would lose out on $2000 which he had planned to put towards his upcoming wedding and furnace repair bill.\n\nNow, I live in a state where regardless of how long you live with a parent, if you are 19 and are not a full time student or full time worker your parent you live with cannot claim you. With that out of the way, I was on the phone with my sister(25f) while our mom was present with me, fuming. I told him that I am sorry he is having financial difficulties, but they aren\u2019t my responsibility. He then tried to call me, I ignored him because I know what he was about to do. He would not let me talk and would just yell at me through the phone. Yelling or raising of voices are a trigger for my anxiety, so I wanted to avoid going into a panic attack.\n\nHe texted me to answer my phone and then called me again. I ignored him again. He then sent me a lot of very degrading and hurtful text messages that sent me in to a panic and made me feel so shitty about myself. He called me ungrateful and disrespectful, held the fact that he did his job as a parent(home, food, clothes, etc.) and said I walk all over people who have helped me achieve my goals. That didn\u2019t get to me though. He had asked me to hang out with my brother that weekend and told me to not even bother with coming over.\n\nThen he told me we are done and uninvited me to his wedding. Told me that I will not be covered under his health insurance. By the last text I was sobbing, shaking and struggling to breathe. I have always felt like I had to fight for his love, affection and time.\n\nThis happened back in February and it\u2019s almost been an entire month since I have heard from my dad. My nana is on his side and told me I should amend my taxes and ask for some money out of it, but I have a strong feeling that he wouldn\u2019t give me anything.\n\nWhile living in his home I paid him $200 in rent every month, had a lot of housework on my shoulders, babysat my siblings (I would cancel plans sometimes if they couldn\u2019t get my nana to do it) on top of working and school. I got burnt out and moved back in with my mom before Christmas.\n\nI don\u2019t feel bad about standing my ground, but I\u2019m sad thinking about what he\u2019ll potentially miss out on if this continues.
