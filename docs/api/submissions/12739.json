{"id": 12739, "submission_id": "11wcwsf", "title": "AITA For claiming myself on taxes which caused my dad to disown me?", "selftext": "I (20f) had already filed my taxes when I got a text from my biological father (45m) asking if I did my taxes. I was honest and told him that I did and reminded him that he told me I could claim myself this tax season. He said that he meant for 2023 taxes and then went on to say how he would lose out on $2000 which he had planned to put towards his upcoming wedding and furnace repair bill.\n\nNow, I live in a state where regardless of how long you live with a parent, if you are 19 and are not a full time student or full time worker your parent you live with cannot claim you. With that out of the way, I was on the phone with my sister(25f) while our mom was present with me, fuming. I told him that I am sorry he is having financial difficulties, but they aren\u2019t my responsibility. He then tried to call me, I ignored him because I know what he was about to do. He would not let me talk and would just yell at me through the phone. Yelling or raising of voices are a trigger for my anxiety, so I wanted to avoid going into a panic attack.\n\nHe texted me to answer my phone and then called me again. I ignored him again. He then sent me a lot of very degrading and hurtful text messages that sent me in to a panic and made me feel so shitty about myself. He called me ungrateful and disrespectful, held the fact that he did his job as a parent(home, food, clothes, etc.) and said I walk all over people who have helped me achieve my goals. That didn\u2019t get to me though. He had asked me to hang out with my brother that weekend and told me to not even bother with coming over.\n\nThen he told me we are done and uninvited me to his wedding. Told me that I will not be covered under his health insurance. By the last text I was sobbing, shaking and struggling to breathe. I have always felt like I had to fight for his love, affection and time.\n\nThis happened back in February and it\u2019s almost been an entire month since I have heard from my dad. My nana is on his side and told me I should amend my taxes and ask for some money out of it, but I have a strong feeling that he wouldn\u2019t give me anything.\n\nWhile living in his home I paid him $200 in rent every month, had a lot of housework on my shoulders, babysat my siblings (I would cancel plans sometimes if they couldn\u2019t get my nana to do it) on top of working and school. I got burnt out and moved back in with my mom before Christmas.\n\nI don\u2019t feel bad about standing my ground, but I\u2019m sad thinking about what he\u2019ll potentially miss out on if this continues. He has removed me from Facebook and Instagram. I don\u2019t want to reach out because that is what he wants.

If you were eligible to claim yourself on your taxes, dad needs to back off. NTA.", "NTA, like previous comment said if your dad acts like this over $2,000 , HE is the asshole. IMO you\u2019ve done enough for him when you were living at his house even enough to cancel your own plans to do so.

I'm sorry he hurt you with his verbal abuse.", "He's not a dad, he's a sperm donor. That is not how one treats their child.\n\nNTA, honestly block him entirely. Cut him out of your life. You are better than he deserves. You are doing great and will grow to be strong and independent (I know you have issues now but you will get through this).

You do not deserve this abuse.", "NTA\n\n>He called me ungrateful and disrespectful, held the fact that he did his job as a parent(home, food, clothes, etc.)\n\nYou don't owe your parents shit, regardless of how much they spent on raising you, because *you didn't ask to be born*. Having kids is essential for the species to survive, but it's an inherently selfish act - they had kids because they wanted their bloodline to continue and you're just the unlucky consciousness that resulted. The law requires them to care for you until the age of majority, and they implicitly agreed to that as the cost of their vanity.", "NTA, you are a fully grown adult if you don\u2019t want to be claimed on someone\u2019s taxes you don\u2019t have to. Mostly when the person that is trying to claim you is being so verbally cruel and selfish.", "You stated at the top of your post that you are at an age in your state where your parent cannot claim you, so where is the actual conflict? If the tax law says you can\u2019t be claimed, that\u2019s the end of the story.", "NTA go no contact. Accept the offer hes bestowed upon you. You now never have to talk to that awful man again.", "NTA, plain and simple. It\u2019s not like you took $2000 from him, he just assumed he could get $2000 out of you.", "An absolute NTA. You might feel bad about losing him now, but it might help you realize how toxic he is. The fact that you already paid him rent monthly on top of babysitting and housework at the age of 19 means that you certainly did more for him than you had to. Good on you for being a nice person and all, but don't let him treat you like a doormat.   \nIn a way, the problem took itself out.  \n\n\nI don't know your local laws around taxes, but isn't that just a return of the tax that you already paid with your work?

I understand some of the house chores as long as it was a good divide up of the work.. but with how you worded that makes me think you had most of the work\n\nI'd be burnt out too.", "Of course you're NTA. To sum it up: your dad just sold his relationship with you and whatever children you may have for $2,000. It doesn't even sound like you were his dependent, as you were paying rent and providing child care. You could tell him if he refunds your rent and pays you all the hours you baby-sat, you will amend you tax return.", "NTA, absolutely NTA. What's there to even discuss about, you were honest with your taxes, helped him out with chores, babysitting along with paying rent that shows your amicable side.  Your father maybe wanted to make you more independent and made you pay for rent, doing chores etc but when it comes to taxes your father doesn't want you to be independent.  \n\n\nAgain there's a moral side to this but I still believe you are NTA.  \nTake care", ">  I have always felt like I had to fight for his love, affection and time.\n\nAnd is it worth the effort?\n\nHe sounds like a real piece of\n\nNTA, good luck OP", "NTA. He sounds like a joke of a father, and quite frankly, if two thousand dollars means that much to him, he can\u2019t afford a wedding and he certainly can\u2019t afford to support new family members. The bottom line is that you paid rent. He wasn\u2019t a parent helping out his child. I think you should ask him if he thinks that every landlord should be able to claim their tenants.", "NTA.  Being in your 20s and without your parents support is rough but it sounds like your dad is done supporting you :(", "NTA. These crappy feelings that you have now, you're going to gd them all the time if you continue to try to have a normal relationship with your dad.\n\nGood riddance to bad rubbish I say. Enjoy your life without this negative crap.", "ESH for not communicating in advance. Are you talking about state or federal taxes? If federal, then your comment about your state's age law doesn't apply.\n\nThere are tests to determine if you fall under the qualifying child, qualifying relative, or non-dependent categories. If he provided more than half your support - and if he paid for your insurance and only charged you $200 in rent, which makes it likely he did - there is an argument to be made that he could claim you. To settle this, you should both talk to an independent tax expert (not the seasonal idiots at the big chains) and see how the law actually lands on your specific situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Therefore, you're not really a dependent or an expense for him. So why does he need to claim you in the first place? As a parent of adult kids, I claim the ones who still live with me and are sheltering in the family home, eating family food, using family electricity, and so on. I don't charge rent, but I do claim them on taxes because it helps offset those costs just a small amount. \n\nThat said, once they move out or move in with someone else, they're no longer a dependent and are entitled to claim themselves no matter how much that might cost me in tax breaks (here's a hint: It's really not all that much). \n\nI understand you're feeling bad, but please understand this: Your dad sounds manipulative, controlling, and domineering. He also sounds incredibly entitled. Frankly, he's abusive. Take your tax refund and do whatever you need to with it. If you don't need it, then put it into savings or splurge.

I have a father that only wants the title father but not the job that came with it .
