They are clearly playing favorites. They passively tolerate your existence. \n\nMaybe you'll become a priority when you have a child?

I have a question, have they done this in the past? before you both married. Did they show favoritism towards your brother?\n\nIs he in the spectrum? does he needs more help and support? is he less independent than you are? how is your relationship with your parents? are they closer to him?\n\nAll of these are good indications as to why they prefer his own company. Also, the fact your brother has a child is a big incentive for them to visit.\n\nI am the youngest child and I am the most independent and capable in the house. My father always favored my older brother because my brother needed a lot more support and he had a lot of issues. My sister is a bit sickly so my mother favored. I don't take it THAT personally because I understand why they feel that way. It certainly sucks.\n\nI suggest having a very long and heart-to-heart conversations about this with your parents. Make your feelings known and do not point your fingers or else they will be super defensive. Good luck and I hope you resolve the issues.", "Setting a boundary is not petty. If they want a relationship with you, they can put forth a modicum of effort, but it doesn't seem that important to them.

Your mother does not want to go see you, but exclusively wants you to come see her.  To me that sounds like a control issue. She wants to show you are subservient to her.  I might have some sympathy for them if they were not flying out to see your brother on a regular basis or visiting your city for entertainment purposes.  You are a self supporting adult with your own home and husband. It's time they start treating you like it. Stick to your guns. No visits to them outside of the holidays until they are willing to visit you.", "NTA. Your parents clearly have a favorite, and I\u2019m sad to say it\u2019s not you.

I love my Dad to death (Mom passed almost 11 years ago) and his fianc\u00e9. He was/is an awesome father and I was very lucky growing up. But I have lived pretty far away since 2013 (about 8 hours away for a while and then 5 hours away... now it's about 17 hours driving) and he has only come to visit me twice in 10 years. I usually go out there at least twice a year to visit. He is retired, so he has the time. And he isn't super wealthy but definitely has the funds to travel because he does so a lot (to visit his fiance's family)... just not to come see me LOL. He even was driving 6ish hours to go see my Mom's family (after she passed and after he started dating his new lady) multiple times a year. Now that I am even farther away, I don't really expect him to come visit at all now, except for maybe once I have babies. I know he loves me and if I like absolutely needed him out here for something serious, I'm sure he would be here in a heartbeat but dang lol. \n\nMy boyfriend's Mom was a flight attendant and could literally go anywhere she wanted for deeply discounted rates and still only went to visit him one time in the 9 years he was in Colorado. Maybe parents just think it's OUR responsibility to visit all the time??", "The one-sideness get old very fast. Especially in this case where the parents are clearly willing to travel to the other sibling and into said city for other social reasons. \n\nJust because you don't have kids doesn't mean that you want to be the one to do all the traveling all the time. I do love to travel so sometimes it isn't an issue, but why am I the one doing all the traveling to visit? \n\nI hope that OP doesn't give into the emotional blackmail.", "Just because they favor their son's company it doesn't mean they dislike her. That's not a logical assessment.", "Good question! Sometimes, if our schedules align. They're retired so they're often here during the workweek so I have less flexibility.", "\"Maybe parents just think it's OUR responsibility to visit them all the time??\" I think you are on to something here. They still view us as children. They are the parents. There home is where the family is centered. Visits must be there because they have the illusion that they have the authority they used to have if they can make us come to them. They are having a hard time adjusting to our being independent adults that are living their own lives that do not center around them and their superior position as parents.", "If I like someone and they like me, I hang out with them. \n\nIf I don't like someone and they like me, I don't hang out with them. \n\nLogic is sound.", "This is weird. Maybe they don't like hotels? Not like its an excuse but i wonder if they are visiting your brother more often since he has a bigger house and they dont need to stay in a hotel?", "Yep. This is what I'm thinking!", "Preferring one's company over the other means that you like the other person more. It doesn't mean you like one and dislike the other. Your logic isn't as sound as you think.", "They stay in hotels when they come to my city to do cultural events, and up until recently stayed in a hotel when they visited my brother :/", "If I make it a habit to hang out with someone and go out my way to do so, I like this person.\n\nIf I make it a habit to not hang out with someone and give an excuse for every time I don't, I don't like this person.", "Ah i'm sorry you guys must be a awful cooks or something or there must be a painting of a frog in your liviong room that your mother is afraid of but doesn't want to mention.

They want to see me (kind of) just not where I live.", "You not only live closer to them than your brother, they can afford to spend their wealth to see you without it affecting them. \n\nThey don't go out there way to visit your for 4 YEARS!!!! \n\nAnd teven when they're in your city, they don't even show up to say HI!!!\n\nTHEY DONT LIKE YOU!!! This is textbook case of you being disliked. \n\nAnd you say they KINDA want to see you? KINDA? Not a strong yes, but a \ud83e\udd37? \n\nThey don't like you!

Is it just the length of time?\n\nIt seems to me that if you wanted to be with your parents and interact with them, that a eating at a restaurant halfway between the two places, and maybe taking a walk around the neighborhood afterwards, is a perfectly good way to spend time together. \n\nWhat will it prove to you if your parents come to your place for a visit? That you \"won?\" Do you actually want to spend time with your parents or just to force them to come visit you to prove a point?", "During a visit we have down time to catch up, cook together, and I can show them the home and community that I've built with my husband.  \n\n\nThe issue is not that I want \"to be with \\[my\\] parents and interact with them\\]; the issue is that for the past four years they've expected my husband and I to visit them nearly every other month and they have virtually not reciprocated despite repeated invitations. Further, they've flown out to visit my brother at least once a month for the past three or so years. \n\nIf my parents were to visit, it would prove that they care about me enough to take the time to see me in my own environment."]}
