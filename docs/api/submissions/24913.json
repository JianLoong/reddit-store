She probably flew off the handle because she was so upset. \n\nPlus, I actually have a scarcity mindset when it comes to food. I think I grew up around people who eat much faster than me and food would always disappear. So this kind of situation affects me very emotionally. Your gf might be the same way. However, she is still an adult and in a relationship, so she should learn to process her emotions better and communicate with you. And you should keep in mind her feelings in the future. I say NTA because I don\u2019t think you could\u2019ve known this would affect her this badly.\n\nAlso, I disagree with everyone saying that OP lording his money spending over his gf. He brought it up because he\u2019s CONFUSED and hurt why his gf is so upset about her money/food being spent by him when he has freely and happily shared his with her. He probably feels like she may feel differently about him than he feels about her. This is not a new argument between couples.
