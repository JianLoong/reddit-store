He is going to prioritize her unexpectedly when bad stuff happens, and you're going to deal with disappointment sometimes.

You are not thinking of this child as his daughter, you're just thinking of her as some person who lives with his ex wife.

Obviously his child comes before a vacation. It\u2019s honestly cruel to expect him to leave his kid when her mother is so sick he needs to take full custody.

His child is going through an emotionally painful and stressful time due to her mothers illness. Her fathers place is with her not stashing her with her grandparents so he can wine and dine you.

A few days before the trip, we found out that our niece (who we weren't even particularly close to) was in a bad situation at her moms house. We canceled the trip and took her in, even got emergency custody (she lived with us for almost 2 years after that). It sucked missing our trip and all that money, but I wouldn't have been able to live with myself if she had stayed in that situation.\n\nI have 4 kids now.

I get being disappointed about the situation as a whole, but his daughter needs him and since you are dating someone with a child, you should fully understand that his child comes first.  You can go on vacation anytime.  NY doesn\u2019t care when you visit, but his daughter will always remember if her father isn\u2019t there when she needs him.", "YTA. She is *five* and scared and needs her dad. Fuck the vacation. I\u2019d leave you for this. His daughter should come first.", "YTA!  You totally lack compassion for the situation & the child.

But unfortunately, you're not really considered a 'real' partner if you're not legally married, and thus your feelings don't matter.\n\nI don't think your boyfriend is particularly an AH because he wants to be there for his kid, which is valid. But she's not your kid, so you don't have the same level of responsibility, which is also valid.\n\nPeople are conveniently overlooking that OP said she's okay with the daughter staying with them permanently, so saying she's not prepared to date someone with a child is a stretch. It's just a few days that OP and her boyfriend will go on their vacation while she stays with grandparents or someone else loving and trustworthy. It's not wrong of OP to think a few days without her father will be some unimaginable pain for the child, because most likely it won't be. \n\nSo for me it's NAH.\n\nPS. I'm going to speculate a bit here and I don't know how long you and your boyfriend have been together for, but I'm kind of wondering if he cheated on OP with the daughter's bio mom, since she's only 5 and OP doesn't refer to the bio mom as his ex or anything, just daughter's mom.", "YTA", "YTA - If you care about your partner you would understand why they need to be with their child during this trying time. Instead you make this about you and you think that its cool to just shove a child going through trauma with grandparents so you can have a romantic getaway.

Why can't you just postpone the trip until things have calmed down?", "NTA. \n\nVisiting NYC for a week is awesome for both of you.

I see no reason why it has to be either don't go on the trip so that you both can watch your bf's daughter...or... go on the trip and leave the daughter with her grandparents.\n\nIf you and your bf have some finances to spare, then maybe go on the trip, but take his daughter too. Yes it may mean that the trip isn't really super \"romantic\", but, at the same time, it could be a great bonding experience.
