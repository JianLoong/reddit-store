Pushing the issue (asking multiple times, asking why not, listing reasons why it's fine for me to eat it, demanding an immediate answer or nudging if I'm hesitant) is when I'll get often get overwhelmed and cry. I'm usually already in an internal fight and that alone can bring me close to tears so I can't handle much exterior pressure. It sounds like his daughter is at least in the process of recovery, so I'm not sure how that differs as I'm not in any treatment currently", "Thank you for taking the time to answer. As with many cultures, mine is one where we habitually offer food, but I don't want to cause any stress. \n\nI think my biggest mistake before reading your answer would be putting a bit of extra food on their plate while attempting to express that they don't have to try and eat it, it's just there so they don't have to ask. But that in itself is sort of a question they'd have to think about. Now, I will always give an open offer and not do or say things that require a yes or no answer.\n\nI also think food as a love language can be expressed by preparing someone's safe foods for them. (I always learn someone's favorite candy so I can have it for them if they come visit, it's a very similar idea.)\n\nI hope that your struggles get easier, dear. You're very kind to open up so we can all learn how to better be supportive."]}
