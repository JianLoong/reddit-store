My daughter is in the early stages of her eating disorder recovery, a thing with ED recovery a lot of people have \u201csafe\u201d foods. \n\nMy daughter\u2019s two main safe foods are popcorn and chicken breast she\u2019ll always eat those. Well, on Thanksgiving we always go to my mom\u2019s considering my daughter is pretty early in recovery we weren't going like usual I knew if I took her it would be a disaster, so I asked my mom if I could grab a plate for myself. Well when I went to grab it on Thanksgiving my mom asked what my daughter was having at this point if my daughter would eat ill let her eat anything and she wanted popcorn and chicken so I told my mom that's what she's going to be eating. My mom acted very shocked and upset. I told her she was going to eat those foods because I rather her eat than not eat. My mom said but it's Thanksgiving... \n\nI tried explaining again how all I want at this point is for my daughter to eat I'll let her eat whatever she wants.

You can\u2019t force your daughter to eat anything and you\u2019re not going to let her go hungry, so of course you\u2019re going to let her eat her safe foods. You\u2019d be the asshole if you didn\u2019t let her eat the only two things that she feels comfortable eating at this moment. \n\n> \u201cbut it\u2019s Thanksgiving\u2026\u201d \n\nYeah, and your mom should be *thankful* that her granddaughter is even okay starting recovery for an ED. She should be thankful that her granddaughter has an amazing father that is willing to do anything he can to help her conquer that ED.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You\u2019re doing great. She\u2019s lucky to have you.", "NTA.\n\n>My mom said but it's Thanksgiving...\n\nAnd she should be thankful your daughter is making a recovery on her ED. You've got your daughter's back and she's willing to eat. That's all that matters.", "NTA but in the future you need to discuss these issues with your family in advance so they know not to make her food choices seem abnormal. Your mom shouldn\u2019t have occasion to take offense or be surprised by your daughter\u2019s food choices. Talk to daughter\u2019s therapists for language / strategies to have these discussion bc from what I understand, eating in groups is difficult enough.", "What type of idiot puts feelings about tradition above managing an eating disorder?!\n\nYou're relatives are chumps. \n\nNTA and good luck supporting your kid OP.", "NTA. You're doing the best you can with what you've got. Anyone who can't be bothered to understand is an AH.", "NTA. It\u2019s your kid. Let her eat what she wants. And as far as \u201cit\u2019s Thanksgiving,\u201d lots of people don\u2019t have turkey on that day. Sure it\u2019s tradition for most people, but it\u2019s becoming more and more mainstream to not have turkey on Thanksgiving.\n\nLet your family know that as long as she\u2019s eating, it doesn\u2019t matter. And unless they want to help raise her, to leave you alone about it. \n\nYou\u2019re a good dad. Keep it up.", "NTA. What you're doing is making sure that your daughter has her safe foods. Eventually, she'll hopefully branch out into other foods, but right now, you're doing the right thing for her by making sure that she has food that you know she'll eat.\n\nPeople with food sensory issues (i.e., connected with autism, for example) often get similar fussing from folks. While I don't have many of those, I've heard enough from other autistic people and their parents that it's hard when family members don't understand. I've got friends with a young daughter. She gets to try what they call 'no thank you bites', that is, she can take a bite if she wants and then say 'no thank you' if she doesn't like it. Eventually, she (and I'm hoping your daughter as well) will be able to eat other foods, but right now, my friends, much like you, are making sure that their daughter has food she likes and is getting other nutrition from other sources. How your daughter gets her dietary needs met is between you, your daughter, and her doctor. Believe me, your daughter will remember that you backed her up when she was going through this and it's already a good thing as far as your relationship with her goes.", "NTA This is none of their concern. There is no national Thanksgiving menu requirement law, ffs.\n\nCharlie Brown has popcorn for Thanksgiving too.

Your family should be more understanding of the situation and support your daughter's journey to recovery", "NTA of course.  The only confusing part is why you'd think any other answer is possible.", "NTA. You\u2019re being supportive of your daughter.

Any kind of pasta with butter and grated cheese. Literally every meal. So for the holidays that year I had pasta with butter and grated cheese.
