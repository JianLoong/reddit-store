Sometimes you just can't afford to make the nice gesture.\n\nDad shelling out money each month and probably getting catfished is really not something you can do anything about.

I called him recently and his wife insisted he hang up due to international costs, even after I said I would cover the costs. I feel like I have now lost my father.

You essentially lost both parents in a relatively short space of time.

Have you tried a therapist to help you with that?", "Mostly NTA, but there is one thing no one else has mentioned. Do you think maybe there is a bit of a cultural clash as well? As far as I know, how family relations are viewed in China is a lot different from the west, particularly when it comes to elders.
