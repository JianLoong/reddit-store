After destroying his third marriage, my dad met his now current wife about a week after separating (classy I know). My sisters and I were all living with our moms at the time and did not meet her until summer. The first night I ever met her I was staying the night at my gmas house and always slept in the loft upstairs. Around three in the morning, my father came there and brought his new gf with him. She was drunk, ripping off her boots and taking her clothes off yelling for me to get out of the bed. Being 14, I had no idea who this naked lady was. My dad followed and said to go downstairs to sleep in my gmas room. I did what he said and slept in my grandmothers room. The next day I called my mom as soon as I woke up to come get me. I had no idea this awful lady would be staying in our lives for a very long time. \n\nAfter that night my dad felt bad, but said she wasn\u2019t normally like this and she was just very drunk. He told us that she has 3 kids of her own, having her first at 14 & She is great with children. Every time we met her tho it was apparent this was not true. She began going with us on our lake trips with our father, calling us names when our dad wasn\u2019t looking and denying it when we told him. He would ask us to ignore her, and told us he loved us no matter what and she was just jealous of our relationship with him bc she didn\u2019t have a dad. At 16, I was visiting my father. They had left the house for something, and I decided to stay. She gave me her iPad and told me I could play on it if I\u2019d like. I thought it was odd she was being nice. What I actually found was awful. The latest picture saved was an edited picture of my mom with a crack pipe in her mouth. I dropped the iPad and called my mother crying. She came to get me & at this time my dad and his wife were back home. She ran from my mom as soon as she saw her. She had already knew what I had found. \n\nYears went by, and more stories that I just told happened. My dad had to keep count of what money was spent on us and whatever we got she cried about. It was exhausting. I\u2019m 26F now and this last encounter just happened. I I\u2019m 6 mo pregnant w/ my first son. I knew this would be probably cause a lot of drama for him and his wife. Last Friday I got a call from my moms friend that my dads wife was heard talking about my pregnancy at the bar. Shouting that my baby shower/nursery colors were ugly, how my father shouldn\u2019t have to buy me a bassinet because I am just going to be a bad mother & let him sleep in the bed with me. More things were said, but this person told me she was getting stares so she started to quiet down. My father was also yelling at her to shut up. \n\nI sat on this for a few. I finally told my dad that I knew what she had said about me at the bar and how much it hurt my feelings. He denied everything. Even though multiple witnesses heard her, he refused to fold. \n\nMy question is, what do I do? I\u2019m so sad. I love my dad but this is too much.", "created_utc": 1679779798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121zue9/aita_for_exposing_my_step_mom_to_the_world/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is not a new phenomenon. It's time to get into therapy and go through the process of grief that accompanies understanding that your dad is completely fine with you being abused, that he's not stupid, he knows what this woman has done to you, and he doesn't care. And that absolutely sucks, and he is absolutely vile, but it's not going to change.\n\nNTA", "You don't have to do anything other than set a boundary. You can go no contact with her & exclusively meet your dad on neutral turf without her.", "NTA. This is not a support sub so maybe you should look for resources somewhere else, but here is the advice: go no contact with her and your father.\n\nYour father is an enabler. He knows she is abusive and he still *chooses her*. He lies for her, he tells you to let go, he makes excuses. Enabling is helping an abuser get away with it.\n\nTell him you will not allow this anymore and if he can't see you without her or be without her, he can live without you in his life.", "NTA- You are allowed to monitor who your baby will come in contact with, and just be honest with him if he wants to see his grandchild then it's on the condition she is not to be around. If he brings her to your house, because that's where you'll be meeting, you tell him he's lost his grandfather privileges, and both of them can leave.", "NTA\n\nI am truly sorry for what you have had to go through.\n\nThat being said, you don't owe this woman an ounce of decency or respect. She seems to be an extremely crass person and if it is going to give you any sort of peace or comfort, telling the world what she did, go ahead.\n\nIf she didn't want her true self to be exposed like this, she should have become a decent human being. \n\nAnd keep your kid away from her please.", "Nta for speaking truth", " I love my dad but this is too much\n\nNTA, I am so sorry this is happening to you.", "I\u2019m sorry but your father has failed you as a parent. A good dad would listen and believe his child, but say to just ignore her. He is not standing up for you when she talks bad about you. He should be protecting you from vile people like this. She is abusive and his passiveness is disgusting and enabling.\n\nYou are worth being loved and protected. Please see a therapist and find a way to value yourself enough to limit contact. It really sounds like they aren\u2019t adding anything positive go your life. Maybe if you let your dad know the list of things that have bothered you and then say you need time away, he can stew and realize he could lose you. \n\nI think finding a good therapist you can trust is key.", "NTA for telling the truth, what you need to do here is assess if having your father in your life is benefiting you. If what you say here is true, he favours her way above his own children", "Go NC with the wife. If you want to see your dad on a LC basis do it privately with only him. If he wants a relationship with your family he can put an end to his wife's abuse first.\n\nNTA", "NTA you're a hero", "good for you! The truth must be aired out like a bathroom on thanksgiving. You can't control your Da but it always helps to steer someone in the right direction and get rid of that nasty woman. But, not your responsibility. \n\nCan't let these miserable folks dampen your experiences with the little guy in your tum. You are the queen right now so don't pay those fools no mind.", "I am sorry. This is a tough situation to handle. Your father is obviously choosing her over you at all costs. I wouldn't suggest going NC, maybe LC. Just don't take to heart anything she has to say. It will be difficult at first, but remember how awful of a person she is and how little she or her opinion matters to you. As for your father, you will have to figure out what works best for you. Maybe refuse to see him if she is there. I would not want my child around a person like her. Who knows what type of emotional abuse she could impose as they grow up. I have always felt that it is our job to make their lives a little better than what we had. Love and affection does not cost a dime and can be given every day.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let your dad or that wicked woman anywhere near your baby.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sorry for what you are going through Op! \n\nI would go low contact or NC with your dad and her. If you would like your Dad in your life, it should be on your terms. \n\nHe can come over for a visit without her. Block her everywhere and I would not let her near the baby. As your baby grows older, you do not want them to hear the horrible things she has to say (especially about you). \n\nGood luck OP! You are going to be a good mom!", "NTA of course, but your father is just as bad as her. Actually, he's worse. He's just stood by and watched this woman abuse and insult his *children*.", "NTA.  Your stepmum has no respect for your boundaries and is just, overall, a vile person.  Unfortunately it seems you're not going to be able to get to have time with your dad away from her since he's enabling her nastiness, so it is best to put distance between yourself and them.", "NTA. Sorry you\u2019ve had to go through all that over the years. She\u2019s the AH and it unfortunately sounds like your dad doesn\u2019t know how to prioritize his kids.", "This is really awful and your dad seems nearly as bad as her tbh, but thankfully he's not mean and abusive towards you. But I'd certainly guess by his gaslighting and enabling behaviour, along with the long line of ex wives, that he's abusive to other people. \n\nEven though this isn't an advice thread, I'm glad you changed your post a few times and now have nothing to judge your actions on. Wanting people to pay for their actions always seems vengeful to me. \n\nLike everyone else said, go NC with her, and strongly consider the same with your dad. Maybe give him a warning that if he doesn't admit and acknowledge the problem, you'll go NC. If he's in any way paternal natured, I'd say he's just in denial himself and once he acknowledges and admits the problem, I'd hope he'll try and do something about it.", "NTA, and i would honestly ghost your dad, at least til her drops her. if a parent can keep acting like that towards their kid over a manipulative brainwashing sperm bank, then he doesn\u2019t care that much. i hate to say it but my father was like that once. and once they split ways he told me it was one of his biggest mistakes and now we\u2019re best friends again.", "I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t gone LC or NC with your spineless dad. NTA", "NTA- tell dad you are going NC for your and your childs safety and mental health. Tell him the truth that his wife is the reason and since he has refused to believe you in the past that you see no proof that he will do anything differently. Hold your ground and keep the positive people in your life cut loose the toxic ones.", "NTA for anything you\u2019ve said and done towards others but YTA to yourself and your child if you don\u2019t cut her from your life and set a firm boundary with your father regarding it. If your father puts your abuser over you in this, which he already has, that is on him not you. He\u2019s to blame for your relationship issues, not you. He can complain about her, make excuses for her, and otherwise pretend she\u2019s a good person as much as he wants but he still allows her to rule his life. \n\nDo you want your child subjected to this woman? Do you want your child to feel the rejection you have felt when grandpa chooses his horrible wife over them? You deserve better than to be abused. Your child deserves better than to be abused. Set a firm boundary with your father and let him deal with the consequences of his actions either way\u2026 if he won\u2019t choose to set a boundary with his wife he doesn\u2019t deserve to be your child\u2019s grandparent.", "How is no one getting video of these incidents? \n\nTime to put it online and let your dad and evil stepmother deal with the fallout. It won't be pretty for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
