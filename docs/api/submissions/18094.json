He says again that it isn't allowed, but with this really nasty look and tone. So I ask for the manager.\n\nWe do the same song and dance, only for him to add that it was making others uncomfortable.

It took me several weeks to understand that we were questioned because she was Arab. Of course they can cite security reasons for this behavior but when you can, you must stand up to discrimination.
