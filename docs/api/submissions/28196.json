My husband john (46M) has on and off jobs, more off than on. At the start of our relationship we had an agreement since I had the education and job experience we didn't want anybody else to raise our kids. At the time he had three kids by somebody else, Jessica (24F), Gracie and Jordan(27 they are twins). My kids I had with him in our marriage are  Taylor (17F) and Charles (19M) both of my kids are still in school but have jobs . John and I  have been married for almost 24 years.   \nFor the last 7 years I have been taking care of all the kids. He decided that he wanted to cheat and step out of the marriage more than once. I always welcomed him back with open arms. I'm now realizing that I shouldn't have but I did. Fast forward to now I've still been taking care of all of his kids, and they refuse to get jobs. Except for the kids that I had. I want to say that they have a mom to take care of them but she just didn't have the money to support them. I knew that I couldn't leave his older kids to be homeless, so I offered them a place to stay.   \nThey are disrespectful to this day, they smoked weed all day, and refuse to help clean. I pay all the bills alone because my husband also doesn't have a job. My kids are in school and still have jobs so I want to know what their excuse is. I can't take care of his older kids for the rest of their lives.   \nMy husband is saying that I'm wrong for pressuring them to get jobs. They live in the real world where you have to have a job to support themself. I gave them the choice, they can either get a job or go back to school. Not college, they haven't finished high school, I tried everything I could to make them go back but they didn't. I know that it's hard to get a job without a high school diploma so I told them to go back to school or get a job. They don't want to work at a fast food place but there aren't many options when you haven't finished high school.  \nI pay over 4,200 bills not including food. I spend over $400 in groceries a week, and mostly they are eating all of it, because my kids will doordash food for themselves or eat out. I do realize that they grew up differently from how I raised my own kids, but I still think it's reasonable for them to get a job. All I'm asking is for $200 for rent. That is more than they spend on weed and drinking in a month.  \nPlease tell me if AITAH or not.  My husband is saying that I am but I need a different opinion.   \n\nEdit: this isn\u2019t an update but see a lot of people talking about how when I got with him he had another girl pregnant. Not true i wasn\u2019t really counting but we\u2019ve been married exactly 22 years I just rounded up.  I had no problem with him having kids because he wasn\u2019t with the girl anymore. I got cancer at 16 and was told that I couldn\u2019t have kids. I took his kids in as my own even though the mother didn\u2019t like me.  I ended up having two kids it was a miracle to me. I also want to add that he has cheated multiple times and his kids knew about it, and were still staying with me. Me and my bio kids didn\u2019t know anything about the cheating until my daughter figured it out herself and started to tell me things.\n\nA lot of yall are asking why I didn\u2019t get a divorce sooner. At the beginning I stated that I had a lot of health issues and the week I told him I wanted a divorce my health went really downhill I spend months in the hospital. I just never got around to it because my health is still bad. I also want to say thank you to everyone for your comments it\u2019s a real eye opener.", "created_utc": 1696398006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zeylg/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_take_care_of_my_husbands/", "score": 1007, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your adult stepkids will NOT change without a kick in their ass. Where are they getting money for weed? It's expensive. Change password on cable/internet daily. No buying snacks. No giving money. No soda. They need to be out of house 9-5. Change locks. Sit down with them and go over all expenses which they have to each pay 1/4 (1/4 for each adult). Give them address of local shelter, food banks, and list of all fast food restaurants they can apply to. Give them 2 weeks to make changes or kick them out.

Sorry if this post sounds aggressive, what you're dealing with hit close to home.", "Nta but you need to stop paying for all the them including the guy who cheated on you more than once. Why doesn't he get a job and take care of his own kids?\n\nIf you don't end this now, it'll keep going. Why would he work for milk when you're giving yours away?", "Stop paying for these mongrels you are making the lives of your other children worse by enabling them and their father. They are adults NTA", "You've been a doormat for so long it'll be very hard to change your perspective and grow a spine. First, you have to be okay with kicking these freeloaders out of your house without feeling guilty and letting them back. Second, you need to seriously look into divorcing that loser of a man you call a husband. You may end up having to pay alimony because you're the breadwinner but it's worth it if it means you won't have to support his horde of losers. YTA for allowing this to continue for so long and letting them step all over your. Your two younger kids no doubt see this and it's shaping their views of how relationships are between adults.", "They could get jobs in nursing homes as either care assistants, domestics or kitchen staff.

Have you considered that you'll never be able to retire?\n\nI would 100% ditch him and the kids need to go with him. Your two children will thank you in the long run, maybe even in the short-term.\n\nIf all of these comments have not compelled you, please think about what you were teaching your children. You are teaching them that it is okay to let someone treat you like this.  Go through your story, only pretend that one of your children is you and that their spouse is doing this to them. What advice would you give them? Because actions speak way louder than words. EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU ARE SHOWING THEM THAT IT IS OKAY FOR SOMEONE TO TREAT THEM LIKE THIS.  When as adults they have drama-filled relationships with users and cheaters, it's because you taught them that was their worth and that was what a relationship looked like.", "1000x this", "Oh crap! I forgot that he cheated! She just needs to kick the entire family out.", "If the house is in her name, she should just evict them all, including the husband.

It\u2019s fucking nuts.", "She literally stated she has a lot of health issues\u2026", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s \u201cchoosing\u201d anything. I think she\u2019s incapable of seeing through the manipulation and doesn\u2019t value herself\u2014for whatever reason. This requires therapy if she can\u2019t get to an \u201daha\u201d moment on her own, with then the fortitude to back it up.", "Not just a cheater, but a 21 year old that already had THREE children.  OP is no hero, she made her own bed.", "Working class traditional is the whole family working.\n\nbut for all history all classes Women would be abandoned for affairs, it was expected of men, they couldn\u2019t control themselves.\n\nit is only modern marriages that expect this level of monogamy, dispite what the church would have us believe.", "NTA. What the hell is happening here?? What has he done to you mentally to make you even question this? You should have been gone long ago, my dear. \n\nBut since you\u2019re not, what the hell are we treating 30 year olds like children for?? What alternate reality is this? Dad and his adult-ass kids need to get a home of their own.", "Exactly! And stop calling them kids! These are full grown adults.  Evict John and his kids.  Your support hasn't even bought loyalty (husband cheats, kids are lazy and disrespectful).  Only one thing worse than being miserably married for 24 years - being miserably married for 24 years and 1 day.", "OP you life and hopefully health will be so much better without 3 drains on you.

She can change the bank account so he has no access, cancel credit cards, buy a fridge with a lock and lock up the pantry. Then serve eviction notices via an attorney", "And I just want to note, her bio kids are old enough now to help out when her health issues are bad.

A clean, cheerful apartment with two fantastic kids!", "Did you ever figure out why your health declined rapidly?

I\u2019m remembering an episode of Forensic Files where this happened\u2026the wife was slowly \u201cadding\u201d something to his meals..", "I doubt with the cheating he will be awarded anything - she needs to save all evidence of cheating and get witnesses before she files for divorce", "She said she\u2019s in poor health so she never got around to it, which I can understand.", "Victims of cheating suffer trauma which causes all sorts of responses - plus she didn\u2019t know about it for a while - let\u2019s keep the focus on the cheater as the AH", "Yes, I used to watch that show all the time. Are you thinking of the arsenic in the thermos? I remember another where the husband was poisoning his pregnant wife.

He'd go to his dad's and get powered and spoiled and then come back to being the youngest of 4, with 3 older sisters, and a single mum who couldn't buy him a new DS every time he yeeted the old one. At one point mum called the Police on him because he was being so violent to all of us for trying to set rules. He doesn't see his dad any more, and he's turned into a truly lovely young man.", "I agree. I've seen a relationship where stepchildren are involved and the biological parent refuses to let the step parent have any parental input towards their biological children.

Not to mention the amount of money that she is spending on these mooches, she can actually hire a home health aide if needed. Or a housekeeper.
