{"id": 28196, "submission_id": "16zeylg", "title": "AITAH for not wanting to take care of my husband's kids.", "selftext": "  \nIm (50F) with a lot of health issues but always have been the breadwinner. My husband john (46M) has on and off jobs, more off than on. At the start of our relationship we had an agreement since I had the education and job experience we didn't want anybody else to raise our kids. At the time he had three kids by somebody else, Jessica (24F), Gracie and Jordan(27 they are twins). My kids I had with him in our marriage are  Taylor (17F) and Charles (19M) both of my kids are still in school but have jobs . John and I  have been married for almost 24 years.   \nFor the last 7 years I have been taking care of all the kids. He decided that he wanted to cheat and step out of the marriage more than once. I always welcomed him back with open arms. I'm now realizing that I shouldn't have but I did. Fast forward to now I've still been taking care of all of his kids, and they refuse to get jobs. Except for the kids that I had. I want to say that they have a mom to take care of them but she just didn't have the money to support them. I knew that I couldn't leave his older kids to be homeless, so I offered them a place to stay.   \nThey are disrespectful to this day, they smoked weed all day, and refuse to help clean. I pay all the bills alone because my husband also doesn't have a job. My kids are in school and still have jobs so I want to know what their excuse is. I can't take care of his older kids for the rest of their lives.   \nMy husband is saying that I'm wrong for pressuring them to get jobs. They live in the real world where you have to have a job to support themself. I gave them the choice, they can either get a job or go back to school. Not college, they haven't finished high school, I tried everything I could to make them go back but they didn't. I know that it's hard to get a job without a high school diploma so I told them to go back to school or get a job. They don't want to work at a fast food place but there aren't many options when you haven't finished high school.  \nI pay over 4,200 bills not including food. I spend over $400 in groceries a week, and mostly they are eating all of it, because my kids will doordash food for themselves or eat out. I do realize that they grew up differently from how I raised my own kids, but I still think it's reasonable for them to get a job. All I'm asking is for $200 for rent. That is more than they spend on weed and drinking in a month.  \nPlease tell me if AITAH or not.  My husband is saying that I am but I need a different opinion.   \n", "created_utc": 1696398006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zeylg/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_take_care_of_my_husbands/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You stated you are not in great health and yet you are still supporting all these leeches? What happens when you\u2019re no longer able to work? Will the leeches take care of you? I don\u2019t see that happening.instead of supporting able bodied people that refuse to work, save that money for when you will no longer be able to work. They\u2019re old enough to support themselves, especially if they manage to have money for their weed. You need to start thinking of yourself, you need to be prepared for when you\u2019re no longer able to work, which could be before your retirement age.", "NTA.  Kick them all out, starting with the husband.  A taste of homelessness should cure them of their laziness. They aren\u2019t kids anymore.", "Not the AH, but quite the doormat. You need a reset, kick them all out except your kids and find yourself and your joy.", "NTA.\n\nOP, this man has cheated on you multiple times per your own admission. He\u2019s taking advantage of you by not working, especially now that your two children are mostly grown, in school, and can do things for themselves. He\u2019s allowing his three other kids to continually take advantage of you.\n\nYou\u2019re not a wife to him. You\u2019re an enabling meal ticket. It won\u2019t get better. He sees you literally as the enabling meal ticket (not just meals, but bills, and childcare). You\u2019re not the wife. You\u2019re not the mother to him. It\u2019s why he cheats.\n\nLeave him. File for divorce and leave him. But before you do that, have a sit down conversation with the two children you share and tell them that. Tell them emotionally, you are beat down and neglected and you value yourself and your children too much to continue to live this existence. If the house is solely in your name, serve eviction notices to all parties. If it\u2019s shared, let them keep it (since they can\u2019t afford to pay bills anyway) and find a place for you and your kids where bills are much more manageable for the three of you (or just you).\n\nGet yourself out of that stressful and toxic situation, and find your happiness. Remember OP, our kids model what they see. Would you want your children modeling this behavior?", "WoW you are too tolerant, it\u2019s time to stop the gravy train for them,husband included. Tell them they have 30 days to either find a job, go back to school or be evicted, and if they get a job a minimum of 25% if their salaries will be required to still live at home. You are being financially abused by them, maybe being homeless, and I would not wish that to anyone is what is needed for them to become better human being", "You need to think of yourself here Op. is it your house or shared. If shared I would cut my losses and rent somewhere for me and teenagers.  The saving on feeding the rest will probably pay your rent.  I would also seek legal advice- you may have to pay maintenance to your husband but nothing for the other adults in the house.  Stewing in their own mess will hopefully make them step up but while you are there they will always assume it\u2019s down to you. NTA", "Nta, but you are to yourself. I highly suggest you change the locks one day when everyone is out, and have 3 copies: one for you, and one of each of your kids. The deal here is that you don't get access to the house without a job. Then you only buy ingredients. I'm willing to bet if his kids are too lazy to help with chores, they're too lazy to cook, so nothing that's premade or microwavable. Change the password to the wifi. You pay rent, you get wifi. Cut off their phones. Daddy or mommy can buy their phones for them. If you do this, change the wifi password first. No wifi, no service, no weed connect. \n\nSpeaking of weed, let me say that less than $200 a month on weed, and that's all they do? They aren't getting good product. Maybe a way to motivate them to get jobs is to tell them their weed isn't dank because they can't afford good shit.", "Why are these adults living in the home you pay for and not contributing? NTA,  but get them out of your house.", "My parents always said if I wanted to stay at home it was earning or learning. NGL it helped me move out and become a fricking ADULT!", "Do you own the home or rent? If I was renting, I\u2019d just take my two kids and move out. If you own, give the four moochers an eviction notice. Why would you support 4 healthy adults? That doesn\u2019t even make sense. You need to take care of your own well-being", "INFO: Do you rent or own your home?", "I stopped reading after \"they refuse to get jobs\". Take your two and get the hell out of there. NTA but if you stay in this mess you will be.", "NTA - There are no ultimatums to be had. You get yourself and your kids together and leave.", "Nta you need a divorce. And full custody of your kids", "NTA- they\u2019re getting away with this behavior because you\u2019re allowing them to. Talk to your children and ask them how they feel about sharing their home with people who don\u2019t contribute.", "Nta.  Lose all of the dead weight .  get your husband and his kids gone.  Why are you letting yourself be treated like a doormat", "Dahm didn\u2019t know people where still doormats for lazy fucks", "NTA, I feel like it's about time you stood up for yourself. You've let your husband leach off you along with three others. How are you still this decent towards them? I would be asking, do I deserve this? Even if they were your own kids, you are setting them up for more failure than they already are. The dad is the worst, though. He is teaching them to be just like him. Can't blame him, it's worked for him for 20+ years. They will take advantage of you until you can't anymore or until they find the next person to mooch from. Value yourself, and set boundaries.  They are not babies. The time to coddle them is over. They need to grow up. I would give them a few weeks to get it together (and that's being absolutely too nice, to be honest) and then kick them all to the curve, including the dad. Don't wait till you're too tired and sick to stand up for yourself. You already sound tired of the situation", "You should Move out with your kids and live happy, productive lives. Your husband and his kids are lazy and disrespectful. Time to stop financially supporting fully capable adults.

I don\u2019t understand why you put up with this you don\u2019t have to.\n\nSince they refused to do anything it\u2019s time to get your papers in order talk to a lawyer and see what your options are. You don\u2019t need this.\n\nLet him take care of his kids. What is he bringing to the table? You can take care of your kids on your own. Time for a separation until you can figure out What is the right road to take. You are at that stage in life that you should be thinking about yourself and what you want your future to be. Don\u2019t waste anymore time on this", "Jeeze.. take your two kids and move the fuck out. Leave hubby and his kids to pay everything for themselves.", "Your husband and his kids see you as a doormat. You enable it.

Stop rewarding bad behavior and consult a lawyer to explore your options.", "Step 1. Escape worthless cheating husband and his worthless lazy kids\n\nStep 2. Profit immensely because you're not supporting 4 fucking useless leeches. Yes, that includes your useless husband. \n\nStep 3.

This is a pretty depressing post.", "Here is why YTA. You say you married him 24 years ago - same age as his youngest from the previous relationship. That would also put him at 22 with three kids. And you married him anyway. You raised these kids with him from infancy. You\u2019re saying you\u2019ve been taking care of the \u201ckids\u201d for seven years, which would put the oldest at 20 when you started \u201ctaking care\u201d of them. None of this makes sense. And now you are placing the blame for their behavior squarely on him? I don\u2019t think so. Ditch the man, but these kids are just as much your fault.", "Divorce, put the house up for sale.
