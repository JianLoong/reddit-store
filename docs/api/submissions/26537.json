Your brother didn\u2019t crack open his wallet even once. You and he both should have been treating to outings and meals as a thank you for his hospitality. YTA and yor brother is an even bigger one.", "Its good to hear that your ex is open to you visiting with your son. Its even nicer that they let you stay at their place during those multi-day visits. It would be completely within their rights for your ex to make you sleep at a hotel. But, it sounds like your ex is being extra accommodating to keep the relationship between your son and you.\n\nIncluding your brother in the visit is kind of not really the ex's business. Visit with uncle is an activity that you choose to engage with during your visitation time. I don't see why you are so hesitant to bring other family to visit with your son. \n\nBut, sleeping at the ex's place is completely different than visiting with the son. If you want your family to visit the kid, I see no reason for the ex to object, but I see no reason that they have to sleep at the ex's place. Hotels do exist.\n\nIts not your exes responsibility to provide housing for the people who visit with your son, not even you.\n\nYTA if you expect that your ex will provide housing for your brother during your multi-day visits with your son.\n\nYour brother is even bigger TA for refusing to quietly leave a house they have been told to.", "Wait- you expect your ex to pay for your brother to go to the \u201cfun\u201d things as well? Why? \n\nMy guess is your ex is not required to pay for anything regarding your trips, but does it for your son\u2019s benefit to show a healthy co-parenting dynamic. \n\nI may be reading this wrong, but If you\u2019re expecting him to fund parts of the trip for your brother -you\u2019re 100% TA.", "YTA. Your brother should be paying his way. Getting free housing is generous. It's also telling your brother wants to stay despite this being an issue.\n\nThe other issue is how much time are you getting with your son only or your son and your ex? I'm glad your family wants to be involved and know your son, but if you see him so infrequently, I think making the most of your time with him is important. I'm not sure how well that's happening with another person along.", "YTA why is it up to your ex to make sure you do fun things with your kid? It sounds like you use your son for a free vacation for yourself, too.", "YTA. Your ex didn't have a problem with your brother staying in his house until he figured out your brother was joining in all the activities at his expense, and your excuse at why your ex got annoyed is absolutely ridiculous \"I think he felt like my brother was intentionally trying to stop us from speaking alone\", he got fed up to being used by your brother for a free vacation. \n\nWhen I was reading I was wondering why ex would have a problem with your family visiting your son, now I understand that he has a problem because he would be expected to house them, feed them and entertain them. I think your whole family is expecting to get an all expenses paid vacation in France with the excuse of visiting your son.", "There are a couple of areas in your post where you either assume or know what\u2019s going on with your ex: he seemed rushed when you asked about your brother, he thought your brother was trying to prevent private conversations between the two of you\u2026 but you didn\u2019t seem to do anything about it: double-check that your brother\u2019s visit & accommodations were still okay before going, get your brother to go elsewhere for a bit for those conversations. Further comments about your ex coming up with fun events and your brother tagging along certainly make it seem like your brother was expecting a virtually free vacation with your ex picking up the tab. Next time have family stay elsewhere and all of your cover your own additional expenses if you want your ex to continue with the accommodations. YTA", "Who is paying for everything, the ex?\nI get he wants to pay your travel, that's pretty decent of him. \nIf he pays for your brothers expenses as well, YTA.", "YTA. For not confirming and communicating your intent with said ex-husband, given his initial rushed response on the phone. Secondly, why would brother need to tag along for all of these family events? And why wouldn\u2019t he try to stop ex husband from paying his way for everything, especially as a guest, being afforded free lodging?! None of this makes sense and it absolutely appears as tho you were deliberately selective and opportunistic about what was said ahead of time and what was deliberately left out.", "Info- why can't he stay somewhere else then? If you and your brother split the cost of a hotel, pay for your own flights and food, plan and pay for your own activities, then all problems are solved.", "YTA, I don't even need to explain the reasoning for this as many redditors have already explained why you and your family is an AH before my post.\n\nLady, just tell your brother to move out ASAP to a hotel and at least have the decency to offer to pay for activities that's being funded by your ex currently. Also, please keep your brother out of activities arranged by your ex for you and your son.\n\nNo wonder, your ex is your ex! I cannot believe how obtuse you are or maybe this is just a deliberate ploy to act innocent to get freebies for yourself and your brother?", "INFO\n\nI\u2019m going to say that it seems like this was a misunderstanding. You should have talked about it again at an other time if your ex was stressed and you really, *really* should have made sure that he was fine with your brother coming before you went ahead and brought him. But the question is, why didn\u2019t you? Was it really because you thought it was fine or did you intentionally avoid saying anything about your brother because you feared your ex would say no? Because the second makes you the asshole. \n\nI also wonder, your ex claimed that your brother is intentionally trying to prevent you two from having any private communication. Is he? Is there a reason that your brother would try to interfere in your relationship and conversations? \n\nThird question: What does \u201cused visiting my son to as an excuse to give my brother a free vacation at his expense\u201d mean? Is it just that you both get free accommodations by staying with your ex? Or is there more that your ex have to provide for both you and your brother? Who pays for food? Does your brother pay for his own food or contribute with groceries? These fun things your ex do with you and your son, are they things that cost money? And if they include things that one needs to buy tickets or pay entry for, who pays that? Does your brother pay his own when he tags along, do you? Or is your ex expected to foot the bill for every one? Because if you and/or your brother expects your ex to pay for your brother, then you are both the asshole and you are indeed using visitation with your son to give your brother a free vacation. Whether that was your intention or not, you might not have that intention and you might just have wanted your family to see your son but if ex is expected to foot the bill for everything then that\u2019s what you are doing. If your brother isn\u2019t offering and insisting on paying his own way, offering to pay for food when out, buying groceries and paying for his spot in the fun activities you do, then he is massively and objectively and obviously the asshole. And if you allow it, so are you. Your ex is giving you both free accommodation, that\u2019s a massive cost that he saves you both. If your brother being there and tagging along on outings adds any extra expenses to your ex, then you are both rude, inconsiderate and make yourselves look like you are using your ex and your son as an excuse for a free vacation. \n\nOh and absolutely do not let your brother confront your ex either way. Even if it is just a misunderstanding that he tagged along, he still tagged along and just showed up to your EX\u2019s home without warning in your EX\u2019s eyes. Ex is already being very polite and accommodating by letting your brother stay, he has already done  more than he is required to. So even if your brother is paying his own way and footing the bill for his expenses, showing up uninvited, which he did since your ex didn\u2019t know/remember agreeing and then making your ex uncomfortable in his own home, as an unwanted guest, means that he gets to be grateful to your ex for even letting him stay in the first place. He doesn\u2019t get to show up uninvited and act entitled. It\u2019s your son, but it\u2019s not your house. It\u2019s your ex\u2019s house. He didn\u2019t have to let him stay there. He doesn\u2019t even have to let you stay there, it would be incredibly rude and damaging to your relationship with your ex if your brother starts confronting him and being entitled in his home! He isn\u2019t owed anything. And it would also be incredibly stupid if you to let him, if your relationship with your ex is damaged you are risking your relationship with your son. You are kind of dependent on your ex if you want to be able to see your son as often and as regularly as possible, I doubt you will be able to visit as frequently as you are if you have to pay for accommodations during your stay. If you or your brother act like you are entitled to bring anyone you want along without permission or any invitation from your ex, he might not be willing to continue to let you stay in his house anymore.", "YTA and your brother is a massive AH. \n\nYou are taking advantage of your ex\u2019s kindness in offering you a place to stay by extending that to your brother. Fine if brother wants to come, but he should\u2019ve found his own accommodations. Absolutely mind-blowing that you and your brother have been letting your ex pay your brother\u2019s way on everything. Have you even offered to pay or given any money to offset the costs? Entitled af. And no, your brother has no right to say anything to your ex. He\u2019s been asked to leave because he\u2019s making the homeowner uncomfortable, then he needs to leave. There is nothing to argue over.", "YTA.  So...how much did your brother pay?  And now your brother is trying to stay...at your ex's...knowing he's not welcome?  Wow.", "YTA.  You\u2019re a rude, unappreciative guest and brought a freeloader with you.", "Yta.  So is your brother.", "Whatever your ex-husband\u2019s issue with the situation is (since you insist that it\u2019s not about your brother staying and him paying for your brother), the fact is, both of you are acting like freeloaders. You and your ex both have a responsibility towards your CHILD. He doesn\u2019t need to host or take care of your lodging and more so, not your brother. Be more decent and pay for both your own ways. If he still has a beef on it, then that\u2019s another issue. YTA", "Did your ex pay for everything for you and your brother?\n\nDo you pay anything to your ex when it comes to helping to care for your son?", "Not necessarily TA, but the test failed.\n\nYou say that this was a test to see if your ex was willing to host your family for an extended period of time so that they can see your son, yet the communication was so unclear that your ex is surprised to see your brother arrive with you.\n\nThese visits with you include sight-seeing fun events that your ex plans and pays for, so now it\u2019s three of you instead of two. You make no mention of your son and the bonding time he may be having with his uncle, only the annoyance on your ex\u2019s part that your brother is not allowing the two of you alone time. Are you and your ex still more than platonic co-parents?\n\nIt was a test, and it failed. Not only did your ex see this as a ruse to get a free vacation for your brother at his  expense, your brother doesn\u2019t pick up on how his refusal to leave is impacting your relationship. \n\nAs others have pointed out, there are hotels, and there is nothing wrong with your brother seeing France and his nephew, but not on your ex\u2019s dime.\n\nDoes your family call, write or FaceTime your son to maintain a relationship? Do you host your ex and sone in your country? \n\nThere may be a financial inequity impacting visitation, but this sounds like those people who are invited somewhere and end up bringing additional friends, arguing that it\u2019s okay because the host can afford it. \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7", "Yta why is your ex paying anything for your brother? Your brother should have gotten a hotel the minute it seemed like you husband didn\u2019t actually know this was happening.", "Wait, you visited your son on your ex dime and invited your brother to leach off your ex without once paying.  \n\nYTA.  Next time rent a hotel and actually spend your money on your child doing activities without your ex.", "INFO does your ex have adequately large living space to accommodate him, your son, you, and another guest (your brother)?", "NTA.

This just turned bad. \n\nYour ex paying for your brother isn\u2019t a good look for either of you! You and brother I mean. You say that he is doing it off his own accord, what does your brother do when it\u2019s time to pay for something? Does he step up and pull out his wallet ready to pay? Is he offering to pay for himself, taking any active action to try to pay? Does he just stand around and wait for your ex to pay or is he actually offering and trying to pay for himself and your ex is refusing? You say that you don\u2019t expect your ex to pay, but is your brother expecting it? Is he acting like he expects it so that ex does it to avoid a potential conflict? If you are at a place where you need to pay entry for example, what does your brother do? Does he try to go first and pay for himself first? Does he step up to the desk and pull out his wallet, actively showing willingness and attempt at paying? Or does he just stand around or talk to you or something, making no attempt at stepping up to the desk or taking out his wallet? Because if your brother is actively taking steps to pay. Acting like he is expecting to pay for at least himself, verbally trying to disagree with your ex paying for him as well, then your ex is doing it out of his own accord. But if your brother isn\u2019t immediately taking out his wallet or at least reaching for it, isn\u2019t stepping up to where you pay, doesn\u2019t offer to pay for at minimum himself, then he is definitely expecting your ex to pay for him and your ex is doing it out of expectation and obligation and not \u201cout of his own accord\u201d. Has your brother offered to pay for everyone like your ex does, has he ever said that \u201cthis one is on me\u201d or something like that? Does he protest when your ex steps up and pays?", "So who were you expecting to pay for your brother?", "Has your ex been insisting he covers your brother\u2019s costs?

Not you, your son, and the uncle.\n\nYour Ex is trying to not make a scene and just talk to you privately (which you labeled as an argument).  That's also normal. An AH will do this directly to your brother without talking to you first.\n\nWhat's **not** normal is at no point you mentioned that your brother paid for anything nor offerd to do so.\nAnd for him to want to talk back to your ex **after getting  free lodging, food, and activities**.  \n\nYour brother ITA.\n\nYou're on the verge of being one because you keep defending your brother.\n\nStop defending the asshole"]}
