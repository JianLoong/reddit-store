He definitely needed a more harsh wake up call, I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself!", "NTA GET AWAY FROM HIM. He is a creep, and possibly more than that... if he cannot respect your boundaries, he may violate other boundaries further. You need to be mean to him to get him away from you.", "Holy shit, NTA, he's a major creep and you need to block him and if necessary, get a restraining order. When somebody shows you who they are, believe them. He's shown you that he's an A H with no concept of boundaries, no qualms about lying, and a manipulative streak a mile wide. Run.", "NTA.", "NTA, what the hell! Get far away from this man\u2014it\u2019s obsessive", "NTA honey. \n\nIf he doesn't care about your feelings, he doesn't really love you. You shouldn't care about him either, you should stop taking gifts from him now.", "NTA. And FULL CAP DON'T LIE ABOUT DATING. That is 11 out of 10 creep.\n\nWhere was the whole buying you coffee, lunch, dinner, or drinks stage?", "Red flag city. Someone who tries to manipulate you into dating them is not someone who you should date. It is someone you should run from.\n\nNTA.", "NTA at all. He couldn\u2019t take no for an answer. That\u2019s not on you. You made yourself clear many times. It\u2019s his own fault for getting into that situation", "ABSOLUTELY NTA. This dude kept disrespecting your boundaries. He hasn\u2019t listened to you at all. It seems all he cares about is keeping up the appearance of dating, not your actual best interest. Not feeling attracted to a person a completely valid reason to not date someone, but there\u2019s way more reasons to not date this guy. Not accepting no is a giant red flag. Drop him completely.", "NTA\n\nHe was never your friend he was just pretending. I'd block him and let a few of your friends know (unless everyone already knows). Please stop hanging out with him even in groups. Yelling at him was absolutely fine at least he can't say he didn't know. I have a feeling that he will pull a 'you led me one by being my friend'. But you owe him nothing.", "NTA - This man is unstable and frankly sounds dangerous. He has *not* been a good friend because a good friend would never behave this way. All of the times he\u2019s **seemed** like a good friend was just a ruse with the intention of one day trapping and guilting you into dating him.\n\nPlease drop this man. You owe him no politeness, he doesn\u2019t respect you. You don\u2019t owe him your time, he doesn\u2019t own you. You don\u2019t owe him your friendship, he doesn\u2019t want it. He only sees you as some prize he has to win. Don\u2019t settle for that, not for a partner and not for a friend. Get better friends, you deserve that.", "NTA. This is sounding borderline harassment, please write every thing down with a date and time. You might need it if he doesn\u2019t stop", "If he won't respect your \"no\" and boundaries *about* not wanting to date, we won't suddenly respect them if you do date. How would this type of manipulative uncaring actions make him a respectful and decent partner? It wouldn't. Stay away, he's NOT a friend or someone you want around. He's the type to think he *deserves* sex even if you tell him no. Run away. \n\nNTA", "NTA OP tried her best but the guy is a bit \u2026 neurotic. \n\nYeah, accepting gifts was weird.  You certainly know the reasoning why he insisted on giving you gifts.  You should have been more firm and rejected the gifts.  It doesn\u2019t matter if you didn\u2019t keep it.\n\nIn my opinion, there were some missteps on your part, but mostly minor.  His roles seem to be psychotic if not borderline psychotic.  Similar things happened to me, and did similar thing that you did.  What I didn\u2019t do was insult her.  Can you imagine a guy calling a girl ugly in public?  The optic of the whole thing?  The key to rejecting someone was being honest and firm.  you don\u2019t have to be mean.  BUT I get it.  You were frustrated.  \n\nMy question is this.  And my judgement depends very much on the answer to this question.  Do you hang out with him regularly?  If so, you are a major AH.  You know he has a serious crush on you, and you keep him around as a confident boost.  That is horrible and selfish.  If he has a crush on you, you stay away from him.  What you did was cruel.\n\nEdited to NTA after I got more details from the comments.", "NTA: you\u2019ve asked him to stop sending you love notes (eww) and he hasn\u2019t. You\u2019ve made it clear that you aren\u2019t romantically interested, he isn\u2019t hearing it. He\u2019s not your friend, he\u2019s pretending to be your friend so he can get his pickle wet, and now that you\u2019ve publicly rejected him, you\u2019re the villain and he\u2019s the victim. Gross.", "In this case, NTA. He would not respect that you did not have interest in dating him, so I think you had no choice but to get more brutal with how you approached him. After all of that, frankly I don't think you should even be friends with him", "NTA. You need to go get a restraining order. NOW.", "NTA. He isn\u2019t a very good friend if he\u2019s constantly pushing you to be more than friends. Sounds like someone who\u2019s just waiting to catch you off guard.", "ESH. He\u2019s way too pushy and deserves the cold hard truth which you gave him. Also, you continually accepted gifts from him even though you weren\u2019t interested in him, and then regifted those gifts. You used the guy.", "Nooo noo noo NTA, this guys is beyond creepy! If he keeps insisting get a restraining order , even through you mentioned its not necessary many of us think like this. He will try something if you dont have a legal way to stop him, your words just slide by and instead of hearing no he hears yes and that huns is very concerning.", "NTA\n\nHe's been telling other people a lie.   You told him the truth.  It may not have been the kindest way to put it, it may have not been the best place for telling it.   \n\nHe held strong to the lie, and you had to get more aggressive about it.   \n\nHe seems to be forgetting that it takes two people to form a relationship, both of them have to say yes to be in the relationship.   Not to mention how much of a violation it is for him to tell his coworkers and mother that you're in a relationship for who knows how long.", "NTA. He\u2019s a creep who doesn\u2019t understand the word \u201cno.\u201d If you fall for this, how many more things will he guilt trip you into doing? \n\nIf he truly liked you, he would respect the fact that you don\u2019t see him the way he sees you. He doesn\u2019t respect you. You need to get out of this relationship now.", "He hasnt bought me anything since, but if he does I won't be accepting it.", "When I first arrived we'd eat lunch together and he'd always pay and refuse me offering him money. So I usually paid in advance if we met up outside of work. As I made more friends I started to stop meeting him outside of work and eating with him, he got annoyed if they asked me about dates I went on which is partially why I started to not eat with him at lunch.", "Starting to get that vibe from the comments. Luckily, he isn't getting his contract renewed so there is a good chance I won't be seeing him after November at all", "I just feel like I shouldn't have said it all in a public place. I feel it could've been really embarrassing for him.", "One of our mutuals did say I shouldn't have befriended him if I didn't want to date him, but that'd be a separate post altogether", "Thank you for saying so, I think I might have to send some time looking at our mutuals as well", "Good thing we live in a world of Screencaps and social media right? \ud83e\udd72", "I hung out with him a lot in the beginning as I was new to the city and didn't have friends there or close by, as I made more friends I started hanging out less. When I was sure he had a crush, obviously never want to assume someone has a crush on me lol maybe he was just being nice you know? But when I was sure, I stopped hanging out alone with him. I'd invite him to group events or talk during group activities etc. He told people we were dating after we had a lunch together when a mutual bailed on us. (Although I think the mutual bailed on purpose as he keeps pushing the fact that I shouldn't befriend men if I don't want to date the man.)\n\nAlthough in hindsight I do feel I should've tried to stay calm whilst in public.", "I've been pulling back, but I have a hard time cutting people off immediately.", "My boss has informed me that his contact isn't getting renewed, so he'll have to leave at the end of the month. I think he'll go back to America as he's been talking about how he's wasted his time in Korea. \n\nSo I don't think a restraining order will be necessary! But thank you so much for the concern", "I suppose I never looked at it as using him, I never asked for the gifts though and if he showed me something and asked if I liked it, I would usually tell him no. But I suppose accepting them could be viewed as using", "I've let my building's security know I don't want him visiting me, so they're keeping an eye out for me, I have a security door (only I know the code), plus a dog. I feel I should've paid more attention when my dog didn't like him. Feel a bit dumb lol", "He's leaving where we work soon and I won't be keeping contact once he's gone", "Why are you even friends with him?? Block him, tell him to eff off.", "Not denying your story but you're saying that you could actually pay in advance for your meal, and hold up a table waiting for him? Not asking it in a way that is unrealistic but you did that for his sake and what is he supposed to imagine?\n\nYou fell into a 'new girl' creep trap is what it sounds like.", "Honestly if it embarrassed him, then so be it. Maybe that\u2019ll be the wake up call for him to stop. Sounds like you were nice to him for long enough and even though you rejected him time and time again he didn\u2019t listen. Sometimes being brutally honest is the only way to get the point across to people like this guy", "Good. I don't think you get how dangerous this guy is, but hasn't shown you yet.", "Would you agreed with him that your \u201cmutual\u201d is correct?", "And this is thr age where you figure out you need to do it. Don't worry about people calling you a b**ch. The sooner you learn that nobody is entitled to your time or energy, the happier you'll be.", "Understandable, I have a guilt issue as well when it comes to things like ghosting, so I very rarely do it myself. This is a case though where not speaking to him again is totally warranted", "Dont feel dumb, just be careful and stay safe , maybe even getting a pepper spray or even a taser will be convenient . My best wishes \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nLet me add that yes indeed dogs will see the intentions of anyone who\u2019s bad.", "We became friends when I first moved to the city, had similar interests and his chair was just behind me so we spoke a lot.", "I didn't do it for his sake, I did it because I didn't want to be in a situation of him always paying. We used to go to a buffet place nearby, so you called and paid in advance for the level of buffet you wanted. I paid that fee, and then drinks were what you paid at the end or if you ate anything off the special menu. You paid at the time of reservation. It wasn't like a random restaurant thing, we'd have planned and made the reservation.  At the start, just the two of us, then as a group (when it was a group event one person paid and we paid for drinks or a percentage back to them).", "I don't think befriending a man means you date them?\nSo no, I don't agree with the mutual. You can be friends with someone and not date them", "Thank you \ud83d\udc95 guess I gotta start working on myself.", "Are we talking USA?", "Ah, so his point was not that you shouldn\u2019t be friend with a man who has a crush on you.  His point was that you shouldn\u2019t have any male friend at all \u2026 which made me curious why is mutual friends with you (perhaps a hints that he might likes you and does not want to get put into the friend zone).  I have to ask, bc I feel like it is a culture thing.  What country are you from or what nationality are you?  Or more specifically, the mutual\u2019s nationality.  It seem a bit outdated \u2026 unless you are from middle or south east Asia.", "No, south korea. Although if it matters, he is American and I am British", "Yes, but this opinion has only come to obvious light since my current situation. He was the guys friend before mine and we met at the start when I went to a boardgame Cafe with him before I started doing my own thing with other friends. They're both American and I'm British.", "Ok, fair enough.  Thank you for all the inputs.  I don\u2019t think you are an AH (I will edit my post).  You were probably frustrated and not know the best approach at rejecting another person.  I think you learn something from this experience.  \n\nNeedless to say, don\u2019t insult people, even when you are upset.  Not just in this case, but in general.  Bc once you do, all of your credibility is gone, and the arguments change from the actual point of the problem into whether you were rude or not.  Which means you would be on the defensive even though you were in the right.  Good luck.", "Thank you.\nThat was the issue I was struggling with, I didn't mean to explode emotionally. I am.going to work on keeping my cool in situations like this."]}
