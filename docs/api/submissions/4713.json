She messed up a couple of times on what counts as a spread, and I showed her why that didn't work, and she understood.\n\nI obviously won the game, but it wasn't a big deal. I showed her how you tally points and what her score was and said she did a good job. She wanted to play again, but then the mom came over and asked me what my problem was. I asked her what she meant.\n\nShe said that it's messed up that I didn't let the little kid win. She said that's why kids lose interest in things, because jerks like me use their experience to crush their dreams. I was so confused, so I just took my cards and went to sit somewhere else. But multiple people were giving me weird looks. I didn't think it was a big deal to the little girl that she didn't win. You expect to lose a few times when learning a new game.

She clearly hadn\u2019t lost interest. Mom is amazed you don\u2019t relate to her child the way she does. smh\n\nI hope that mom isn\u2019t removing the child from every fun-but-challenging activity she encounters. Because I think that will crush more dreams.\n\nSome parents are weird.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n> She said that it's messed up that I didn't let the little kid win. She said that's why kids lose interest in things\n\nWhat's interesting about winning every time?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s normal to lose at times, that\u2018s fine and important to learn. And the child seemed to be fine.", "NTA.\n\nKids have to learn they won't always win.  And they'll learn more from losing than from winning.", "NTA.  You provided knowledge to the little kid and learned.  It's okay to win in the context that you provided.  The little kid most likely isn't some type of card savant although seems to be very bright by your description.  People learn through success AND failure.  If anyone is going to kill any dreams, it's the mom since she is the one who changed the dynamic by her own actions, poor kid.", "NTA. People lose interest in games when folks like this mom turn them into activities. Games have rules, the possibility of win/loss, and an agreement that all participants will pursue a win condition of some variety. The appeal of games comes from these factors.\n\nIf you were playing with this kid regularly, you should play on hard mode (trying for less likely win conditions, spotting points) so that she occasionally ekes out a win. With gin, if you know the rules you will end up taking a game or two off of pure luck eventually with a bomb opener.", "NTA. Everyone had their own philosophy about letting kids win, giving them an advantage, or not. Always winning denies the real joy of winning because you won, not because someone let you win. Always losing is about as bad: always losing gets old, and that happens faster with little kids. I've found mixing it up works best for the littlest, with an initial loss, followed by a win. As they get older, it becomes more important for them to earn their wins.  Strangers on a bus: follow your own philosophy. The long game of how to be a good winner and loser is up to the parents (if they haven't taught the kid gin by now, what do they care about the kid's long term enjoyment of the game. )", "NTA because I never understood letting people win - but it may be helpful to know that young kids aren\u2019t developmentally ready for competitive games and cooperative games are much more fun (less dramatic) to play with them.", "NTA- The girl clearly was interested to still learn, despite losing so I don\u2019t understand the entitlement the mother feels for her daughter winning. She needs to get crushed a few times to learn, not only does it help her learn but it also helps her understand good sportsmanship.", "NTA.  It sounds like you were very good to the kid.  You taught her how to play a game.  She figured it out quickly and although she lost you told her she did a good job.  Sounds fine to me.  I don't know why you should be expected to let her win just because she was a child.", "NTA. I don't think you did anything wrong at all. I mean it looks like you were playing with a kid and explaining everything to her. \n\nYes, winning a kid and rubbing it in their noses it's awful and may led them to loosing interest on things, but it doesn't look at all like the scene you are talking about. A kid plays, is still learning and losses the game, these things happen and are also important, learning to lose and tolerate frustration is also a valuable lesson.", "INFO: Did the kid seem upset about it or cry at all? Or just the mom was upset?", "NTA\n\nJust because you're playing against a kid does not mean you gotta let them win. You were nice enough to teach her and play with her. Kids gotta learn that things won't always go their way. The mother is TA.", "NTA. That's part of learning to play cards. That makes it much more satisfying when you finally beat them.", "NTA.\n\nIf you were teaching and explaining things, that's fine. Kid approached you and showed interest.\n\nMom is being overprotective demanding that you automatically let the kid win. Especially when the kid wanted to play again, that's how we learn", "NTA. My great-uncle taught me chess and he NEVER let me win, not even once. I always begged him to teach me more and it was a huge thing for me as a kid to be able to play with him. I loved it and treasure those memories.", "As a mom of 5, I can assure you that you are NTA. You weren\u2019t being cruel, rubbing your win in the child\u2019s face, you were having a genuine teaching moment and from your description the child seemed to be understanding and enjoying it. That was absolutely the type of engagement in an activity that helps children learn and grow in the best way!", "NTA. In this \u201ceveryone gets a trophy\u201d culture we wonder why we are nurturing crybabies! Losing is a valuable lesson that makes people great.", "NTA. Kids need to learn that you got to earn that win. I never let my kids win, they earn it. When they earn it, it\u2019s so much better for them. It makes me smile, knowing they worked so hard to earn that victory.", "\"Was I an asshole to that kid?\"\n\nNo.  NTA, but let the 5 YO win the first game or two.\n\nAfter the first one, Never Don't Quit!  Take no prisoners.  \n\nCrush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of the women.  This is best in life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You showed her where she went wrong and asked her if she wants to give it another go.

My son's great-grandfather uses to let him win (after making him work a bit) and would always say something to me for not letting him.  I told him that it gave him a mountain to climb and that when he did finally beat me then it would be something he'll be proud of.  As other have pointed out, the kid wanted to play again, so losing did not damage her.", "NTA, why do people think you always have to let a kid win? Losing is a part of life and it's healthy to learn to deal with it. Also, obviously she wanted to play again, so she wasn't upset about it, why should her mom be?", "NTA. Parents like the one you described are easily in my top 5 pet peeves.", "NTA.  Kids can handle losing, the parents are the ones with the problems.", "NTA - you did a nice thing, and if you taught my kids something they enjoyed and kept them occupied for a bit, I'd be grateful!", "Bleh to that mom, and NTA to you.\n\n\nI used to date someone who would get upset about losing at games. He'd had a bad day, I'd suggest playing cards for something fun to cheer him up, and then I'd have to carefully lose (while seeming to be playing full on) because he would be unhappy and grumpy if he lost. That's the kinda gamer this mom is trying to raise, and it's no good.\n\n\nThe joy should be from the game, not the victory \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26", "When my mum threw games in my favor as a kid, it stopped being challenging and fun so I lost interest. \n\nWhich, on reflection, is probably why she did it, so I\u2019d stop making her play Chutes and Ladders. Ha!\n\nAnyway. NTA. You were being kind to a kid who wanted to learn something new.", "THIS NTA", "Me either, it really cheapens the win imo.", "No, she was focused on the game. She didn't really care about the score. I think she was bored by the math part and liked the cards part better.", "And kids can generally tell if you are throwing games, they arent dumb", "NTA. It would have been one thing if you made the kid cry, but if they were content and enjoying it, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. Kids need to learn they are not going to win at every single game they play. We played tons of card games when I was growing up and as kid sometimes my mom did beat us. As long as it's fun, that's what matters. That mom is setting her kid up for some issues when they get older though."]}
