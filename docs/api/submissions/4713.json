She clearly hadn\u2019t lost interest. Mom is amazed you don\u2019t relate to her child the way she does. smh\n\nI hope that mom isn\u2019t removing the child from every fun-but-challenging activity she encounters. Because I think that will crush more dreams.\n\nSome parents are weird.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n> She said that it's messed up that I didn't let the little kid win. She said that's why kids lose interest in things\n\nWhat's interesting about winning every time?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s normal to lose at times, that\u2018s fine and important to learn. And the child seemed to be fine.", "NTA.\n\nKids have to learn they won't always win.  And they'll learn more from losing than from winning.", "NTA.  You provided knowledge to the little kid and learned.  It's okay to win in the context that you provided.  The little kid most likely isn't some type of card savant although seems to be very bright by your description.  People learn through success AND failure.  If anyone is going to kill any dreams, it's the mom since she is the one who changed the dynamic by her own actions, poor kid.", "NTA. People lose interest in games when folks like this mom turn them into activities. Games have rules, the possibility of win/loss, and an agreement that all participants will pursue a win condition of some variety. The appeal of games comes from these factors.\n\nIf you were playing with this kid regularly, you should play on hard mode (trying for less likely win conditions, spotting points) so that she occasionally ekes out a win. With gin, if you know the rules you will end up taking a game or two off of pure luck eventually with a bomb opener.", "NTA. Everyone had their own philosophy about letting kids win, giving them an advantage, or not. Always winning denies the real joy of winning because you won, not because someone let you win. Always losing is about as bad: always losing gets old, and that happens faster with little kids. I've found mixing it up works best for the littlest, with an initial loss, followed by a win. As they get older, it becomes more important for them to earn their wins.  Strangers on a bus: follow your own philosophy. The long game of how to be a good winner and loser is up to the parents (if they haven't taught the kid gin by now, what do they care about the kid's long term enjoyment of the game. )", "NTA because I never understood letting people win - but it may be helpful to know that young kids aren\u2019t developmentally ready for competitive games and cooperative games are much more fun (less dramatic) to play with them.", "NTA- The girl clearly was interested to still learn, despite losing so I don\u2019t understand the entitlement the mother feels for her daughter winning. She needs to get crushed a few times to learn, not only does it help her learn but it also helps her understand good sportsmanship.", "NTA.  It sounds like you were very good to the kid.  You taught her how to play a game.  She figured it out quickly and although she lost you told her she did a good job.  Sounds fine to me.  I don't know why you should be expected to let her win just because she was a child.", "NTA. I don't think you did anything wrong at all. I mean it looks like you were playing with a kid and explaining everything to her. \n\nYes, winning a kid and rubbing it in their noses it's awful and may led them to loosing interest on things, but it doesn't look at all like the scene you are talking about. A kid plays, is still learning and losses the game, these things happen and are also important, learning to lose and tolerate frustration is also a valuable lesson.", "INFO: Did the kid seem upset about it or cry at all? Or just the mom was upset?", "NTA\n\nJust because you're playing against a kid does not mean you gotta let them win. You were nice enough to teach her and play with her. Kids gotta learn that things won't always go their way. The mother is TA.", "NTA. That's part of learning to play cards. That makes it much more satisfying when you finally beat them.", "NTA.\n\nIf you were teaching and explaining things, that's fine. Kid approached you and showed interest.\n\nMom is being overprotective demanding that you automatically let the kid win. Especially when the kid wanted to play again, that's how we learn", "NTA. My great-uncle taught me chess and he NEVER let me win, not even once. I always begged him to teach me more and it was a huge thing for me as a kid to be able to play with him. I loved it and treasure those memories.", "As a mom of 5, I can assure you that you are NTA. You weren\u2019t being cruel, rubbing your win in the child\u2019s face, you were having a genuine teaching moment and from your description the child seemed to be understanding and enjoying it. That was absolutely the type of engagement in an activity that helps children learn and grow in the best way!", "NTA. In this \u201ceveryone gets a trophy\u201d culture we wonder why we are nurturing crybabies! Losing is a valuable lesson that makes people great.", "NTA. Kids need to learn that you got to earn that win. I never let my kids win, they earn it. When they earn it, it\u2019s so much better for them. It makes me smile, knowing they worked so hard to earn that victory.", "\"Was I an asshole to that kid?\"\n\nNo.  NTA, but let the 5 YO win the first game or two.\n\nAfter the first one, Never Don't Quit!  Take no prisoners.  \n\nCrush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of the women.  This is best in life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My son's great-grandfather uses to let him win (after making him work a bit) and would always say something to me for not letting him.  I told him that it gave him a mountain to climb and that when he did finally beat me then it would be something he'll be proud of.  As other have pointed out, the kid wanted to play again, so losing did not damage her.", "NTA, why do people think you always have to let a kid win? Losing is a part of life and it's healthy to learn to deal with it. Also, obviously she wanted to play again, so she wasn't upset about it, why should her mom be?", "NTA. Parents like the one you described are easily in my top 5 pet peeves.", "NTA.  Kids can handle losing, the parents are the ones with the problems.", "NTA - you did a nice thing, and if you taught my kids something they enjoyed and kept them occupied for a bit, I'd be grateful!", "Bleh to that mom, and NTA to you.\n\n\nI used to date someone who would get upset about losing at games. He'd had a bad day, I'd suggest playing cards for something fun to cheer him up, and then I'd have to carefully lose (while seeming to be playing full on) because he would be unhappy and grumpy if he lost.

She didn't really care about the score. I think she was bored by the math part and liked the cards part better.", "And kids can generally tell if you are throwing games, they arent dumb", "NTA. It would have been one thing if you made the kid cry, but if they were content and enjoying it, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. Kids need to learn they are not going to win at every single game they play. We played tons of card games when I was growing up and as kid sometimes my mom did beat us. As long as it's fun, that's what matters. That mom is setting her kid up for some issues when they get older though.", "BuT EveRyBoDy iS suPpOseD To Win!

Losing is part of competing which is part of life in general. You did her a favor by interfering with her iron-clad plan to raise an unsuccessful quitter. I would have laughed in her face.", "Even at a young be age children need to learn to lose and learn to win with good sportsmanship. Unless you were entirely ruthless, you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nNot every kid is wired that way, that winning is the only way something is fun. Personally as a kid I would absolutely hate it when adults would deliberately lose to me in games, because it was usually just so transparent and therefore it didn't really feel to me like I had achieved anything. No joy in victory if it hasn't been earned.", "NTA\n\nI learned a new term last week: snowplow parent. Someone who goes ahead and tries to smooth out life's little bumps so their child has no troubles. Loosing a game of gin isn't a life altering moment in that girl's life but mommy had to come and try to smoooooooth things out so little one's \"heart isn't broken\" or whatever. \n\nAnd you didn't lord it over her.

For a first timer, even if they lose, that means so much.", "NTA\n\nI am related to a child who grew up always being allowed to win and when he went to school and other children didn\u2019t let him win EVERYTIME he has become a nightmare, screaming, kicking, crying and refusing to play or participate unless he\u2019s allowed to win \n\nI mean every so often let them win but they\u2019ve also got to learn how to do things without \u201cwinning\u201d all the time", "NTA.

You can never be great at anything if you aren\u2019t willing to suck at it in the beginning.", "Exactly!\n\u201cLetting kids win every time\u201d is in the same category as a \u201cparticipation trophy\u201d. It\u2019s so important for kids to learn that sometimes you lose, sometimes someone else performed better than you etc- even if you tried your best. This creates healthy expectations and responses to situations where things don\u2019t go your way and prevents (or mitigates) an entitled attitude and view of the world. \n\nThe only slight issue with OP is that he should have asked/cleared it with the mom before playing with the kid. I know that wasn\u2019t the mom\u2019s problem with the interaction, but some parents are worried about their kid\u2019s interacting with strangers (sometimes very justifiably) so it\u2019s always a good idea to ask.", "My dad was the same way. He kicked my ass every single time and I'd ask for rematch after rematch. I will never forget the only time I ever beat him - castle short that he didn't see coming. He looked at the board, looked at me and just grinned because he knew I won. Took a few more moves, but it was a done deal. And then he proceeded to kick my ass every other time we played. I still suck at chess, I still love playing it, and I'll always love those memories with him.", "Funny. But actually I think if you\u2019re going to let a kid win, the second game makes more sense. \u201cLook! You learned!\u201d\n\nBut it depends on the kid.

Great memories.", "Helicopter parents: the bane of our society. NTA", "So NTA\n\nNot winning the first time gives you a goal, something to strive for.  When I was 8, and learning how to play cribbage (from the biggest cheat east of the Mississippi) I never won.  Ever.  It took ***years*** before I managed to beat my grandfather.  But it was worth it when I finally did, and I will ***never*** forget how that made me feel.  Even better than just winning was that I skunked him.  Gave me bragging rights for a couple months at least.\n\nAllowing a kid to win just gives them a skewed perception of reality, and sets them up with unrealistic life expectations.", "Letting kids win every time is what ends up in broken electronics when playing video games, due to the tantrums of playing against others who are out to win too. NTA", "NTA I'm going from personal experience here that you are in the right. I was about 5 ish when my dad and our neighbor decided to teach me to play cards. We started with gin. Both had different methods. Our neighbor (and my adopted grandpa) took pitty and let me win. It was fun. But my dad played cards all his life and he took it seriously, he played to win. He made it fun but I became a good card player from him challenging me. Pretty soon my dear gramps couldn't win LOL. I'm 42 years old again and both those men are gone and there is nothing I would love more than to beat their pants playing cards one more time.\n\nThis isn't why kids loose interest in things. That mother is full of it and probably what really sucks the fun out of their kids life.", "Mom is wrong, the kid wasn't upset at all by losing because you weren't a dick about it. You explained this is how to play kid did well, but ultimately lost because they're new to the game but asked for another turn. Maybe the kid would have won the second or third game had mom not intervened like that.", "NTA\nI was taught chess by father, grandfather and uncle when I was 5-6. They never let me win. First time I won against my father was when I was 14, and I still didn't beat my uncle (I'm 28 now). It was frustrating to lose time and time again, but it only made the victory so much sweeter (my father was close to kicking me out because I was gloating for days :D ). You should teach kids how to play games and help them get better. Just letting them win is stupid and may teach them that everything should come easy for them.", "The mom is going to be one of those bulldozer parents.  The sooner the kid learns that someone has to win and someone has to lose, the better of she'll be in life.", "**NTA.** The woman was out of line. I'm sure the kid was thrilled to be treated like a serious opponent. It shows respect! \n\nI once beat a teenaged niece in a game, and was chided afterwards.

Mom should be super-grateful that a nice person played a game with her kid and gave her a little break.", "NTA. You teach the kid nothing by letting them win/get their way all the time.", "NTA. I have two nieces and I have never \u2018let them win\u2019 at any game we\u2019ve played. \n\nI congratulate good moves and explain other options on bad moves. \n\nRegardless of the outcome we shake hands at the end and say \u2018good game\u2019. \n\nIf they win, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve earned it. If they lose, they generally want to play again for another chance to beat me. \n\nThey\u2019re now both tweens, and can be competitive little shits (just like myself and their mother were at that age) - but they\u2019re also graceful in defeat and in victory.", "A casino where I always win?
