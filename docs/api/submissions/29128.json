She has a cat that she got with her ex before me, it's a rescue. We agreed that he fully remains her cat and such she carries responsibility. Although difficult at first (and still is a bit) he grew to trust some people. He still is very anxious so I try to give him alot of positive reinforcement. Examples: when he is being happy and playful I reward him with some treats and pets. He has never really been outside and is very anxious but also very curious. So I reward him when that goes alright and also when he comes back in willingly when I call him. I pet him alot in general and enforce my GF rules less strict to try and let him explore and play and be a cat. This led to me and the cat building a nice bond, stronger than my GF and the cat because she gives him less attention.\n\nI walk downstairs, cat is happy, makes a playful jump, so I give him some treats. I little more than normal by accident, oops. So I pet him and say in sweet voice something that roughly translates to: \"who's gonna be my little fatty boi\" (not actually fat at all). GF corrects me and says \"our\". I responded that I didn't mean anything by it and just tried to be playful.\n\nAlso the dishwasher was ready to be unloaded and she asked which one of us would do it, I volunteered. On the kitchen counter was still a plate, knife and cheese slicer from my breakfast. She hates if it's left on the kitchen counter but it couldn't go in the dishwasher yet (there were also two small plates, glasses and tableware from us both). So she gets annoyed by this, but I can't do anything about it yet.\n\nThis happend 5 minutes before my gym appointment with my buddy so I had to solve it afterwards. When I came back I started unloading the dishwasher and we got talking again. She was irritated by the dirty dishes on the counter and said she wants me to stop giving the cat attention since our relationship is hanging by a thread lately. The cat should be stronger attached to her than to me. What I couldn't get her to understand is I was just trying to be nice to her for volunteering and to the cat for giving him attention. And no harm was intended. I couldn't because she already interrupted saying I don't have to be nice to the cat, I only have to not hate him. And volunteering to unload was negated by the dirty dishes.\n\nThis is the story without going into very deep details.\n\nMy buddy at the gym said he wouldn't comment since he hadn't heard her side of the story. But said to me \"why don't you just say sorry and move on?\". I guess I couldn't, but he did get me thinking maybe iata. And then my GF called me an asshole. So I decided to go here.", "NTA. Sounds like she's looking for reasons to pick on you.", "NTA Don't know if she grew up somewhere with disfunction but she sounds like a hot mess. Nitpicking the way you talk to a cat? Yuck."]}
