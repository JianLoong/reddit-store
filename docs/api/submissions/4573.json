We both have kids from previous relationships.  My husband has 2 kids (6M & 4F).  I also have 2 kids (19M & 17F).  My 19-year-old son is off at college, but my 17-year-old daughter lives with us.  Like any blended family, there have been some growing pains and adjustments for everyone.  But up until now, we've been able to work through any issues together.  \n\nMy daughter, Ann, is going through a rebellious phase.  A couple weeks ago she got caught sneaking out and taking the car that my husband and I got her.  We grounded her for 2 weeks for it.  Like most teens, she felt we were being too harsh and that since she is going to turn 18 in about a month, she should be able to do whatever she wants.  \n\nOn Saturday, I was out shopping with some friends while everyone else was at home.  My husband got a call from his mom after she got a flat tire on a rural road (we live in a pretty rural area).  She asked him to come help her change it.  My husband asked Ann if she could watch the kids while he went to help his mom.  Ann refused and said his kids weren't her problem.  They started to argue and my husband told Ann that if she doesn't help with this, then he will have to talk to me about extending her grounding punishment.  So Ann eventually relented.\n\nWhen my husband got home about an hour later, both his kids were in tears.  They were asking him if what Ann said about Santa was true.  Apparently, Ann had told his kids that Santa wasn't real and that the gifts they get on Xmas morning are from their parents, not from Santa.  He confronted Ann about it and she apparently told him that they would have found out the truth sooner or later anyway.\n\nWhen I got home, my husband immediately confronted me and said we need to do something about Ann's behavior because she \"ruined\" Xmas for his kids.  He said he wants to return presents that we have already bought for Ann and send her to her dad's for the holiday because he doesn't want her around his kids during Xmas after what she did.\n\nI talked with Ann about it and she said she was frustrated that she had to babysit when she's already being punished and that my husband should have just taken the kids with him because they aren't her responsibility.  \n\nI asked my husband why he didn't just take his kids with and he said if he had taken them with it would have taken him longer to help his mom and that he was barely gone for an hour.  He said that Ann's behavior is unacceptable and if I don't agree with his punishments for her, then he will take his kids to his parents for Xmas and I can spend it with Ann alone.\n\nI told him that if he had just taken the kids with him, then this wouldn't have happened and that he needs to accept some responsibility for this as well and not put it all on Ann.  She knows what she did was wrong and she did apologize after the fact, but my husband is refusing to budge on his punishments.

So, Ann did nothing wrong in your eyes? She refused to step up and help the family in an urgent situation, she hurt little kids' feelings out of spite, and when confronted about it she blamed your husband for her own terrible behavior. \n\nFrankly, the way you took Ann's side here shows unequivocally that you don't care about your husband's kids. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the beginning of the end of your marriage.", "I don't care who is the asshole, however, you have raised one nasty piece of work. You must be so proud.", "ESH.\n\nThere is a whole lot going on in this 'family' and you all need to get to therapy ASAP if you have any desire to hold this thing together.\n\n1. Ann's own actions got her grounded. By the way you describe her attitude in this post, she has no remorse and just wants to 'do what she wants to do'.\n2. She was deliberately cruel to little kids, further reinforcing that your kid is out of control and it doesn't seem as if your current style of parenting is working.\n3. There was an urgent situation. It wasn't an emergency, that's true, but your daughter probably should be taught a thing or two about being helpful and gracious to others.\n4. Your language describing the two littles (I asked him why he didn't take 'his kids' with him instead of 'the kids) seems a bit off. I wonder if the issues with merging your family units might have some basis in the way that you (and maybe even your husband) subconsciously view one another's children and level of responsibility towards those children. If the adults in the equation have that boundary, is it any wonder that your kids do, as well?\n5. Your husband should have explained the situation to Ann and offered to compensate her for watching the children. Just because she's there and older doesn't make her an automatic sitter.\n6. You are essentially supporting her selfish behavior by not holding Ann accountable for her actions.\n\nOverall, your post reads like a prelude to a divorce, honestly. It's little things like this that tend to lead to small resentments that fester over time to become larger issues. If your daughter is more comfortable and stable at her father's house at 17, perhaps she needs to be given the option to be there instead? Your husband isn't going to forgive or forget your daughter inflicting this on his children anytime soon. There were better ways for everyone to have behaved all the way around.\n\nETA: While your husband wanting to split up the holidays is extreme, I wouldn't necessarily want to expose my small children to someone who had been cruel to them either.", "YTA. If a 17 year old asshole had ruined the magic of Christmas for your kids when they were younger, I'm betting you wouldn't have made excuses for it and would have wanted them punished. Your daughter was deliberately cruel to innocent children and no half-assed apology from her is going to change that. She ruined their Christmas deliberately  so having hers ruined in return is fair.", "[removed]", "YTA, your daughter is TA and your husband has every right to be furious.   He helped by her a fucking car and this is how she repays him???   I'd sell the fucking car if I was him and not get her shit for Christmas.

So what she apologized, you can't un-say shit.", "YTA  A smart kid would have taken the tack that if she helped out, maybe her grounding wouldn't have lasted so long. Your daughter fucked up and doesn't like the consequences? Tough shit. She's not entitled to a car. Watching the kids for an hour is nothing. She is being actively malicious,  and she's old enough to know better.  She may have apologized, but the damage is already done and YOU'VE done nothing about it.  I wouldn't be surprised if your husband takes his kids somewhere else for Christmas without either of you.", "YTA\n\nYOU can\u2019t put that genie back in the bottle.\nYour daughter ruined something special for your husband and his kids. She can say she\u2019s sorry and she knows she is wrong but she still needs consequences for what she did as retaliation because there is NO WAY to fix this. This was an act to hurt others. \nIt didn\u2019t just hurt dad it hurt his kids. She dragged the kids who had nothing to do with this into it.\nIf anything you should be upset for them. \n\nAll you seem to be doing is victim blaming. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened if you did this\u2026\u201d\nThe request was reasonable and the amount of time was less than an hour. It was a huge overreaction on her part.\n\n\nI would have left my kids home too if I had to get out of a car to fix a flat tire. It\u2019s not a task that allows you to keep an eye on your children (and depending on where the flat was it could be dangerous).\n\nHe (your husband) certainly overreacted, but I\u2019m going to chalk it up to being incredibly pissed at her insensitive act. If he keeps pushing returning gifts and sending her away, then he\u2019s an AH too.", "YTA with the tiniest dash of ESH. Your daughter is going through a vicious asshole phase, not a rebellious phase. This was entirely her fault. Idk why you\u2019re ok with her getting away with whatever, but she was incredibly cruel to her little step-siblings.\n\nI only add ESH because I think your husband\u2019s idea to separate her out of Christmas will only make problems worse. He has no experience parenting teenagers, so this is where you come in with actual parenting instead of the crap you\u2019ve pulled so far. If she feels genuinely bad (big if) then she should be able to apologize to her stepdad GENUINELY and also sit down with the kids and tell them she was being silly and didn\u2019t mean it.", "YTA, and so is your daughter. He was going to change his mom's tire. Can you imagine two little kids climbing all over a car or outside running around while you're trying to change a tire??? And for your daughter, I couldn't even imagine crushing two little kid's belief about Santa because I was upset. It crushed me when my daughter was in 2nd grade and a little boy told their entire class about Santa. I couldn't even imagine if a close family member had done it. \n\nTell your husband you're sorry and extend Ann's punishment.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is 17 and behaves like a brat, judging by: ''I told him that if he had just taken the kids with him, then this wouldn't have happened and that he needs to accept some responsibility'' I think you are enabling her lack of maturity and bed behavior.  Usually, I'd agree that not her children, not her problem but it was an emergency, and She sure could help out with it .", "YTA but so is your daughter. And stop dismissing it as she\u2019s just in a rebellious phase. She was mad at your husband and took it out on 2 kids who had no day in any of it.", "YTA Ever try working on a car in an emergency situation with small children by the side of the road?  The concept is ridiculous. A little compassion from your daughter could have gone a long way. Your daughter is an AH too.", "Just tell the kids that Ann doesn't know that Santa is real because he only brings presents to good kids and she never got any from him.\n\nYTA, btw. I don't know what consequences there should be but something needs to be done. She is almost an adult and needs to get a handle on her emotional reactions.", "ESH - returning presents and basically disowning Ann makes your hubs an AH.  Ann is a huge entitled AH.  She broke rules with a car you both bought her and then took out her punishment on her step siblings.  And you are in denial.  Your daughter messed up and you are making excuses for her.  She is a spoiled brat and you are trying to blame your husband for being mad (even though he is going too far, he does have a right to be pissed.).  In addition, bringing kids to change a tire?  Not safe for them to be around a roadside or a car on a Jack.  Ann was there and should have helped out but again, spoiled brat.  \n\nThus, everyone in this story sucks.", "ESH\n\nTelling really young kids that Santa isn't real is a low blow and can never be taken back. Your daughter took away years of a magical experience from them and their father. \n\nAt the same time, the husbands punishments seem a little harsh. You shouldn't return gifts and kick the daughter out of the house for Christmas for it. If he wants to take his kids to his family for Christmas, let him. I'm guessing you also helped in purchasing these gifts for your daughter? He has no right to tell you that you have to return them.\n\nAlso, the daughter is getting ready to turn 18? Doesn't seem like she is ready for the real adult world. She seems to be acting very childishly. Is there a good reason she couldn't watch two kids she has been living with for an hour when she is already grounded and stuck at home? Since she was already in trouble, a little good will couldn't have hurt. She seems very entitled. \n\nIt would be really hard to change a tire with having to watch young kids or hear their complaining about being stuck in a car for an hour. I'm not sure why you would think it would have been a good idea.", "ESH.   \n\n\nAnn shouldn't have said what she said, (even if it's true.) You don't sound very sympathetic to your husband, and saying he should have taken his kids with him to change a tire, when your 17yo was available to help out is ridiculous.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, your husband's demands are extreme.

Your daughters just being a brat and took her frustrations on being punished out on your husband and his kids. \n\nWhat did you then do, you blamed your husband for the situation and the golden child, your daughter, did no wrong in your eyes.

I would not have wanted to bring my 4 and 6 year old along to deal with a side of the road flat tire incident either. It was NOT a big ask of your daughter.  \n\nI'm saying ESH, because I think your husband's demands of returning all her Christmas gifts and sending her to her dad's is cruel and his refusal to budge on the issue makes him a jerk, too, however I'm wondering if this isn't the first incident with Ann and he is fed up with her behavior?", "ESH \n\nAnn is an entitled brat.

If this is unacceptable then that is a boundary that you need to put in place.  But that is for you to address with him, not her.  The key words being you and him. \n\n>I told him that if he had just taken the kids with him, then this wouldn't have happened and that he needs to accept some responsibility for this as well and not put it all on Ann.\n\nHe does not.

Your  AH daughter has completely destroyed the magic of Christmas for those two young children and you don't seem to see that. Think back to when your children were younger and how exciting Christmas was. Your husband is over reacting but that's because he is furious that your daughter has ruined the magic of Christmas. He wants to ruin her Christmas just like she's ruined his children's Christmas and while I don't agree with it, tbh it's understandable.", "YTA and you're only enabling your daughter's AH behavior. What she did was purposefully cruel.", "ESH. Your husband sucks for demanding she be a babysitter and threatening further punishment. YTA for refusing to see the monster lurking in your daughter. What she did is sick and sociopathic.  This isn't a \"rebellious phase\". What she did to those poor kids is disgustingly cruel, and she is either going to be a nasty human being for life, or you can open your eyes and try to get her some help. There is nothing normal about a nearly 18 year old being so insanely immature and callous to very small children. That's messed up.", "ESH because his suggestion was overkill, and made it clear what he thinks about your 'blended family'.\n\n>He said he wants to return presents that we have already bought for Ann and send her to her dad's for the holiday because he doesn't want her around his kids during Xmas after what she did.\n\nYou're TA for not seeing she needs to be punished, but you should have discussed what was best rather than blame him for what happened. Your daughter intentionally upset the younger kids and showed no remorse for it. \n\nIf you're not careful you'll find yourself with a choice to make once she turns 18", "Wow, so many arseholes here. Firstly, you and hubby for your ridiculous punishment of someone who is essentially an adult. That she feels she has to \"sneak\" out to use her own car says volumes about your parenting. I can't help but wonder if her \"rebellious phase\" adds up to nothing more than her standing up for herself for a change.\n\nAnn's behaviour also makes her TA as well...watching her little step-brother and sister wouldn't have killed her. It's what family does. And telling them that there's no Santa...that's crossing over a big line.\n\nSo, bottom line - YTA, hubby TA and Ann TA  - but she was goaded into it.\n\nYou and hubby need to admit you both acted like tyrants and let the whole matter rest.", "YTA.  You said it yourself that Ann is going through a rebellious stage. This girl just made the kids cry for no reason.  If she has an issue with her lifestyle or punishments she\u2019s facing because of her own actions then she can grow up and talk to you guys about it.  She doesn\u2019t get to make the rules of the house or cause havoc just because she\u2019s an upset moody teen.\n\nA further punishment is entirely merited. She should be embarrassed for making little kids cry.", "I understand that this is a \"my kids\" vs. \"his kids\" situation, but Ann is living with you.  Is it really punishment to watch to small children for an hour?  Her response to his request really crossed the line, and she did ruin the kids Christmas. They were far too young to find this out. YTA for not supporting your husband and Ann is a total AH for what she did.", "YTA.\n\nWell, Ann is TA, but you're backing her up.  None of this is your husband's fault.  Ann is acting less mature than a 4 year old.  She may not like your new husband.  She may not want to call him \"Dad\" but there are two things she has to deal with whether she likes it or not:\n\n1. she lives under his roof\n2. she is not an adult yet\n\nThe former means that she owes a certain duty, at a minimum, to follow some basic rules about living on someone else's dime in someone else's  accommodations.  The latter means she can do what she's told.  If she didn't want to babysit, maybe she could have got off her lazy arse and gone to change the tire, while your husband watched the kids.\n\nI hated brat-sitting my siblings when I was that age.  Every older child hates it.  But sometimes it's necessary, and being a dick about it doesn't improve the situation.\n\nAnn is clearly hoping to drive a wedge between him and you.  Looks like she's winning.  However, this is a teaching moment.  If your daughter is \"going to turn 18 in about a month, she should be able to do whatever she wants\" then your daughter can go buy her own presents,  and learn about why, as an adult, you can't always have things your own way.", "NTA, but this does sound like a tricky situation.\n\nOn the one hand, Ann \"apologizing\" doesn't really mean a lot. She knew she was doing permanent damage and she decided to take out her frustration with your husband on his kids, who did nothing to deserve it. Especially when she initially defended this, explaining they'll learn eventually anyway, I don't think she's particularly sorry about it.\n\nHowever, yeah, she spent about 16 years being \"the youngest\" and so she hasn't had this kind of last-minute-babysitter responsibility thrust on her before, which is common for older kids in the family. It would have been \"fairer\" to her for your husband to take them with him, but that also seems ridiculous when there is a 17 year old at home and it'll take under an hour. \n\nHis solution to basically kick Ann out of Christmas doesn't seem appropriate because, while I understand from his perspective she \"ruined\" Christmas for them, this will exacerbate her rebellion problem. If he's playing enough of a stepfather role that he expect her to babysit last minute, then he's playing enough of a stepfather role to deal with his bratty teen daughter on Christmas even when he's pissed with her. \n\nSome kind of compromise where Ann does something special for the kids on Christmas sounds like it would get to the root of the \"ruining Christmas\" problem without your husband actively trying to exclude your daughter from the holiday.", "ESH\n\nWhen she refused, he shouldn\u2019t have threatened extending the grounding.

Someone who does that not because THEY frustrated or hurt her, but just to get back at her step-father. I repeat, YIKES.", "Yta, and Anne also.

I was taught this my whole life.", "Let me get this straight. \n\nYour husband helps buy his stepdaughter a car. \n\nShe rolls the dice, sneaks out with said car (knowing the consequences) and gets punished thusly once caught. \n\nThen, he asks your daughter to watch his kids for less than an hour since SHE'S ALREADY AT THE HOUSE BECAUSE SHE'S GROUNDED while he doea a good deed for family.\n\nDaughter doesn't like the situation so she shits on Christmas for 2 innocents in retaliation?\n\nYou get mad at him for being upset at your daughter's atrocious behavior. \n\n\nYTA and your kid is an even bigger AH.", "ESH. On Christmas Eve when I was five years old, my neighbor told me there was no Santa. Fortunately my mom had a copy of \"Yes, Virginia. There is a Santa Claus.\" I believed and it kept me going for years. Your daughter did something so cruel. Her intention was to punish step-dad, but the repercussions...yikes. Your husband is expecting way too much! Yes, he should have taken his kids with him. Both you and he should have agreed from the start that she was not her step-siblings babysitter.

She's 17 and needs to get permission to use her own car and has to sneak out the house. I have a feeling there's a lot of controlling going on on yours and your husbands part and she's finally had enough and standing up for herself. \n\nIt's clear dad doesn't like your daughter and is now being a bigger AH by making you choose him and his kids over your daughter!\n\nReturning her gifts is just setting yourselves up for even more disaster.", "Your husband and your daughter are both TA here (more so your husband by far). Your daughter is 100 percent correct that the children are NOT her responsibility and he should NOT have threatened her and basically gave her no choice. If anything he should have offered to pay her. \nClearly it was an AH move to tell the children about Santa. She was trying to punish your husband, but obviously hurt the kids (this should be discussed with her)\nHowever your husband\u2019s outrageous punishment suggestions are ludicrous, and will only create destroy your relationship with your daughter. \nYour husband owes an enormous apology to your daughter and your daughter owes an apology to the children.", "ESH except for the two little kids\n\nYTA for attempting to control a kid who is almost 18 from going out at night. Without knowing why she snuck out, I don't understand why someone who is going to be 18 in a month is not allowed to come and go pretty freely. Was there some particular danger if she went - why do she sneak out?\n\nAnn is an AH for punishing the children by telling them that Santa Claus doesn't exist although I would imagine the six year old is pretty close to learning that information and would probably spill the beans anyway. Most people learn there is no Santa at some point - you could use the famous Yes Virginia There Is a Santa Claus newspaper essay and explain what the spirit of Christmas is and that \"Santa\" does exist.\n\nYour husband is the AH because taking away Christmas presents and banishing a child by sending her to her father is not appropriate in terms of the punishment. Is spending time with her father the kind of thing you want viewed as a \"punishment'.\n\nWhile I understand why your husband didn't want to take the children, it really wouldn't have been such a big deal since his mother could have sat with them in the father's car while OP's husband changed the tire. His mother really wasn't going to do anything that required her active presence while he changed it. It could have been an opportunity for his mother and the kids to spend some time together.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the famous \"editorial\" here it is\n\n*Dear Editor: I am 8 years old.*  \n*Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.

They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men\u2019s or children\u2019s, are little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.*\n\n  \n*Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.*\n\n  \n*Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see.*  \n\n\n*No Santa Claus!

We both have kids from previous relationships.  My husband has 2 kids (6M & 4F).  I also have 2 kids (19M & 17F).  My 19-year-old son is off at college, but my 17-year-old daughter lives with us.  Like any blended family, there have been some growing pains and adjustments for everyone.  But up until now, we've been able to work through any issues together.  \n\nMy daughter, Ann, is going through a rebellious phase.  A couple weeks ago she got caught sneaking out and taking the car that my husband and I got her.  We grounded her for 2 weeks for it.  Like most teens, she felt we were being too harsh and that since she is going to turn 18 in about a month, she should be able to do whatever she wants.  \n\nOn Saturday, I was out shopping with some friends while everyone else was at home.  My husband got a call from his mom after she got a flat tire on a rural road (we live in a pretty rural area).  She asked him to come help her change it.  My husband asked Ann if she could watch the kids while he went to help his mom.  Ann refused and said his kids weren't her problem.  They started to argue and my husband told Ann that if she doesn't help with this, then he will have to talk to me about extending her grounding punishment.  So Ann eventually relented.\n\nWhen my husband got home about an hour later, both his kids were in tears.  They were asking him if what Ann said about Santa was true.  Apparently, Ann had told his kids that Santa wasn't real and that the gifts they get on Xmas morning are from their parents, not from Santa.  He confronted Ann about it and she apparently told him that they would have found out the truth sooner or later anyway.\n\nWhen I got home, my husband immediately confronted me and said we need to do something about Ann's behavior because she \"ruined\" Xmas for his kids.  He said he wants to return presents that we have already bought for Ann and send her to her dad's for the holiday because he doesn't want her around his kids during Xmas after what she did.\n\nI talked with Ann about it and she said she was frustrated that she had to babysit when she's already being punished and that my husband should have just taken the kids with him because they aren't her responsibility.  \n\nI asked my husband why he didn't just take his kids with and he said if he had taken them with it would have taken him longer to help his mom and that he was barely gone for an hour.  He said that Ann's behavior is unacceptable and if I don't agree with his punishments for her, then he will take his kids to his parents for Xmas and I can spend it with Ann alone.\n\nI told him that if he had just taken the kids with him, then this wouldn't have happened and that he needs to accept some responsibility for this as well and not put it all on Ann.  She knows what she did was wrong and she did apologize after the fact, but my husband is refusing to budge on his punishments.  \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your daughter is 17 and she told your husband of one year she doesn't see his little kids as her problem - in the middle of a family emergency - then took her anger out on them in a spiteful but likely not permanently damaging way. Of course she was wrong not to help - who wants to change a tire for their mom with two little kids in tow? Your husband is right about that. And her mean actions to the kids make it worse. BUT even strangers have best instincts to help out in an emergency. And your daughter is not a stranger but part of this family. So why doesn't she see it that way? This could be a red flag that she's struggling with something about your (her) new life and needs help adjusting. She's still a kid herself, and you and your husband are the adults.

You and your husband need to get on the same page about what is expected of the older children in regards to the younger children.  For him to make a unilateral decision that Ann owes it to him to babysit his children \"or else\" is a very poor choice.  On the other hand, what Ann did was deliberately hateful.  She was cruel to the littles because she was angry at their dad.  Also a very poor choice.  There really needs to be some consequences for that.  Work it out.  This is not going away without deliberate effort and transparency.", "YTA, your daughter is more than rebellious. She's being actively cruel to very young kids and you're totally fine with it!?! Shame on both of you!", "YTA\nYou daughter was cruel to a 6 and 4 year old. She sounds truly awful and I hope she grows up a bit and regrets this. I can\u2019t imagine what she is thinking to justify being cruel to small children. If anything you should be worried about why your almost adult daughter is treating children this way. You were a mother at close to her age. Could you have treated a child like that ?", "ESH: \nI actually think the actual main issue is that the blending family dynamic isn\u2019t working as well as you hoped/thought.\n\nYou say that your daughter is going through a rebellious phase, but it\u2019s not exactly unlikely that the phase was brought on by the introduction of a new family dynamic. She now has an additional authority figure in her life and two younger siblings that she might be expected to care for. That\u2019s difficult for a teenager to come to terms with, and might explain her rebellious behaviour.\n\n1. What she absolutely in the wrong stealing your car? Yes, but I\u2019m not sure grounding her was the best punishment in this case. If anything it\u2019s going to keep stewing up resentment that she\u2019s stuck at home with her \u201cnew\u201d family that she is already having trouble with. Maybe get her to volunteer over the Christmas break, which are very busy (especially women\u2019s shelters) to teach her a lesson about thinking about others and acting a little more kinder.\n\n2. Was your husband unreasonable in his demand that your daughter take care of his children in an emergency? No. Should have he hung over a punishment over your daughter\u2019s head? No. Again, your daughter is not used to the new blended dynamic. She now has another person who she probably doesn\u2019t regard as an actual parent telling what she can\u2019t and do. Moreover, a 17 year old who has grown up with a nine year old sibling usually understands after 7 years that in the case of a rare emergency, you would have to sacrifice your own time and babysit. Someone who only recently gotten younger siblings is understandably a lot less willing to sacrifice their own time, or be fine with that responsibility. \n\n3. Was your daughter cruel in her response to your children? Yes. Which is why again, maybe you should put her in volunteering rather just grounding her. That being said it\u2019s not overly traumatic, and with a few weeks left until Christmas I do think the situation can be rectified, whether by taking your step kids out more often then you would have to catch a movie or whatever. Saying that Christmas is ruined because they found out the truth about Santa a couple years earlier than their peers is a bit of an overreaction. In other words, they\u2019re kids and this isn\u2019t an unsalvageable situation. They\u2019re hurt over this but they\u2019ll also bounce back fairly quickly. \n\n4. Your problem is that there needs to be clarity about the type of dynamic your blended family will have. Are you and your husband separately responsible for each of your children? Are your eldest children expected taking on a more typical older sibling role? Are you okay with everyone just simply getting along, or are you trying to make a \u201cproper\u201d family. Be honest with yourselves and address the fact that the person probably taking this the hardest is the eldest daughter. And while being 18 won\u2019t protect from the consequences of dangerous and uncaring actions, she would be granted enough freedom to distance herself from your family if she don\u2019t try to rectify the situation with her. If she goes to college, she might not want to return if she resents her step-family enough (whether right or wrong or to do so). If you want your daughter to stay in your life; then you\u2019re probably going have to spend more time with her in her adjustment to the new family.\n\nAgain your daughter isn\u2019t the right person in all this, but you as a parent probably have to do more to address her specific needs in such a difficult time.", "Didn't  he help her mom buy a car for not his daughter. That's ok he spent money on her for transportation an car ins6. But hey fuck him an watch your own kids. Sell the car an make her walk", "YTA. Life is going to suck when she grows up.

If some entitled bratty teenager ruined the magiv of Christmas for my 4 year old I would return her gifts and she would recieve a lump of coal in her stocking. She knew exactly what she was doing.

I wouldn't want her or her enabling Mother around either.", "ESH, you new husband isn't her dad and yet he has full control over how to discipline her. She should not have said that about Santa but he cannot blackmail her into babysitting. She's not a parent and shouldn't be forced to watch his kids. You're also I. The wrong for allowing all of this. Blended families take time and it sounds like you're forcing a relationship between your child and your husband and his kids", "Info: was the situation with the kids able to be resolved?  Did Ann tell them she was lying because she was angry. Robbing the magic of Santa from a 6 and 4 year old is unbelievably cruel and she needs to do everything she can to fix it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s outrageous that your husband doesn\u2019t trust her not to ruin Christmas for the young children given her current behavior.  Also, were the presents that he wants to take back bought with his money?", "Your 17 year old daughter is a really crappy person and you\u2019ve raised a nightmare. Congratulations and YTA.", "YTA", "YTA! So is Ann. Rebellious or not, you don't ruin Chrome for little kids. She intentionally hurt them to keep from having to babysit again and to prove her point.  This wasn't a mistake,  misunderstanding, or unintentional slip on her part. She did it specifically to hurt those kids so that their pain would teach your husband a lesson.", "ESH\n\nYour blended family is less than a year old. Ann was 16 when you got together. I wonder how your husband will cope when his children are these ages. If it is badly, I daresay he will blame Ann.\n\n'Grounding' is a stupid idea . What does it benefit anyone or teach anyone? Mainly resentment IMO. And it is detrimental to physical and mental health. And mental health is already an issue simply because of hormones at 17.\n\nI cannot understand this obsession with punishment.  The object should be to improve relationships. Constant punishment will do the opposite.  Why do you all think Ann didn't want to cooperate by babysitting? And why did she spoil the children's fantasy about Father Christmas?  She was threatened into agreeing to babysit. No excuse for her mean disclosure but it is understandable that in the powerless position you parents put her in, she wants to hit back.\n\nIf this punishment stuff continues say good bye to your daughter as soon as she can get away.\n\nThis scenario is all of your own making and especially your husband's.", "Yikes you're an AH", "NTA. Yeah, I know. I'm going to get downvoted here, but the whole Santa thing is a lie. So she told the kids the truth. One that the dad didn't want them to know yet, but the truth just the same.

Both your daughter and husband were wrong however you made the ultimate move by taking Anne\u2019s side and defending her since you blamed your husband. Therapy is absolutely needed and based on your daughters behavior in what you\u2019ve mentioned she needs 1:1 therapy because she obviously has a lot of pent up something built up. And your son isn\u2019t coming home for Christmas? I see 2 possible reasons here. But yeah you messed up big time.", "ESH, in my opinion. \n\nYour daughter should have babysat. While the kids aren\u2019t her responsibility, it is the decent thing to help out when someone asks a small task in an emergency situation. She also never should have told two very young kids that Santa isn\u2019t real. \n\nYou are the asshole as you shouldn\u2019t be blaming your husband for your daughters bad actions. \n\nYour husband is the asshole as it isn\u2019t a just punishment to send a teenager away for Christmas, instead of celebrating with family. Also he might be the asshole or not the asshole depending on whether or not he is allowed to punish or threaten to punish your daughter without your permission \n\nFinally you are all the assholes as you are so involved in your drama that you didn\u2019t try to fix it. Kids are smart in some ways, but really dumb in others. You could have saved the situation but didn\u2019t. There are hundreds of Christmas movies about people who stopped believing in Santa and Christmas and then started to believe again. Make that a punishment for your daughter that she has to act out a whole situation where you tell the kids that they need to help her believe in Santa or something, have them go on a whole \u2018journey/investigation\u2019 in which Santa is proved to be real and your daughter must believe again. They are 4 and 6, just try to fix it.", "NTA, all these y t a seem to miss how he black mailed her into baby sitting by saying he would extend her punishment so yeah they were both wrong and he does need to accept that his part in refusing her now.

Dude could\u2019ve done the bare minimum and offered her a small amount of money, which most cash strapped teens would eagerly accept, and been done with it.  She might even have taken the offer for payment as an olive branch and declined the money while still watching the kids, because it\u2019s amazing what people will do when you make them feel valued.  Instead he acted like she owes him for providing a home or car or whatever else he wants to hold over her head and she resented that and acted out.  \n\nIt really sucks for the kids though, and I\u2019m not denying that the daughter was an asshole for that part.  I certainly understand why he\u2019s upset with her for what she did, but he can\u2019t seem to acknowledge that his own behavior had any role in it.", "Not yet, but that's what he wants OP to do:\n\n> He said he wants to return presents that we have already bought for Ann and **send her to her dad's for the holiday because he doesn't want her around his kids during Xmas after what she did**\n\nThat's kicking her out. He's trying to exclude her from their family holiday, and the fact that he went there right away makes me wonder how long he been wanting to do that and if that's why she's in a \", rebellious phase.\" It also shows that he doesn't consider her his kid, because you don't just kick your kid out when they piss you off unless you're a super crappy parent."]}
