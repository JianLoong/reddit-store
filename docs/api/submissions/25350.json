{"id": 25350, "submission_id": "15zb0wx", "title": "AITA for not allowing my mother to bring her boyfriend I don't know or want to know to my wedding?", "selftext": "I (33NB) am not close with my mother (55f) at all. She divorced my dad (60) when I was 7 and almost immediately married my stepfather \"Mark\" whom despite everything, I was close with. They remained married until I was 16. I was upset when she divorced him and went to live with my dad and stepmom. In my adult life, I've chosen to remain close to my stepdad and even attended his wedding to his current wife, who is a very nice woman. My dad and my stepmom are great people.\n\nSince her divorce to my stepdad, my mom has been in and out of relationships, each time claiming this guy is the love of her life until they do something she doesn't like and they aren't the love of her life anymore. Both divorces with my dad and my stepdad were for very petty reasons (dad, I think because he wouldn't allow her to get a new car because the budget was tight). I think the one that lasted the longest was 6 years and I think it's the current guy she's with, according to my sister. After I left home, she never did anything with me without her boyfriends. When I was 25, she broke up with her boyfriend and tried to cry to me about it. After working with my therapist, I set the boundary with my mother that if she wasn't willing to do anything with me without her boyfriend to not bother and I didn't want to talk about her love life. She was very hurt and we fell out for awhile but she came back around about a year later and has respected my rule since but we only get together about 3 or 4 times per year. I understand that my mom's relationships and love life are important to her so I respect that we don't get together often.\n\nFast forward to this year, I'm getting married to my partner (35M) of a decade in October. It's a small intimate backyard wedding and reception/bbq. We live in a rural area and our backyard wedding will have roughly 40 people. My dad, stepmom, stepdad and his new wife have all been invited. My mom asked if she could bring her boyfriend, I said no because I don't know him. My mom asked if she could bring him to meet me so I could meet him before the wedding. I said no and that I still had no interest in meeting her boyfriends. She said she understood but she felt it was unfair that I wasn't allowing her a +1 to my wedding when my dad and my stepdad were allowed to bring their spouses. I told her that the difference was that I knew their spouses. She wanted to know why I was so adamant about refusing to get to know her boyfriend. I explained to her that I saw no need since she'd just break up with them and move on to someone else eventually as she has always done before. She started to cry and told me I was being unreasonable and treating her as if she's a wh\\*\\*e.\n\nBoth my fiance and my sister feel like I should suck it up for one day and let her bring her boyfriend so she can be comfortable there. I'm seriously considering it but I wanted to know if I'm TA here for sticking to my boundary at my wedding and what your thoughts are.\n\nUPDATE: After reading everything here, I've decided to email my mother and invite him. I was already leaning towards telling her that he can come when I posted. I decided to set some ground rules for my mother:\n\n1. He is there as a +1 to my mother only. I made it clear to her that he is not my family and he is not my stepfather so I will appreciate her not telling other people at the wedding he is my stepfather. Mark is my stepfather and he will be there.\n2. He is not to be in any family photos (in fairness, my stepdad Mark won't be in any family photos either, only my mom, dad, stepmom, and my siblings).\n3. He is not to approach me at any point during the wedding and reception.\n4. This does not change my previous boundaries. I'm only allowing him to come for her own comfort and to create a sense of fairness. I respect the fact she is in a relationship but that her love life has nothing to do with me and I wish to keep it that way.\n5. I told my mother that these are my terms for him being at my wedding and my terms are final and that I hope she can respect the fact that I'm trying to be reasonable. I used this opportunity to remind her the reasons I put the boundary up in the first place. These reasons included forcing me to do activities with her shorter term boyfriends in the past, forcing me to only discuss her love life while showing no interest in my life, and putting her relationships above her own children.\n\nIf she responds, I'll let everyone know.\n\nUpdate 2: My mom called me within 10 minutes of getting the email. She thanked me for allowing him to come and said they would abide by my terms. She said she felt really hurt that during her actions during her \"mid-life crisis\" are why I'm refusing to meet her current boyfriend (who she says she's been with for 7.5 years) and that she thought things would eventually calm down enough where I would be comfortable meeting him. She said she now realizes that it will never happen. I told her that I'm firm on my stance. I think she started to cry but she said she understood and only wants him there because being around my dad and stepdad and their \"new\" wives (my dad has been married for 23 years and my stepdad for 12) makes her anxious and he helps keep her calm. She said she respects my stance and said it's her own fault I feel this way. I felt this may be the start of a guilt trip so I politely ended the call.", "created_utc": 1692812766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zb0wx/aita_for_not_allowing_my_mother_to_bring_her/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After 6 years he is most likely an important part of her live. Wanting a relationship with your mother but insisting vehemently on excluding her partner does not seem sustainable.

It seems judgemental. Your mother has a long time partner and it's your choice to have never met him. Not every person just meet the one person and stay with him/her for the rest of one's life. It's okay. You would be very obset with your parents if they refused to meet any new partner of you because you don't stay long enough with them in their opinion. So why the very hard boundary that you will never ever meet another partner of her? Any partner of 1-2 years is worth to be met. Because it's a big part of her life and the relationship is stable enough. You don't have to bond with the person, but to respect their relationship. You still don't have to meet them very often, but NEVER is really crazy to me. \n\nI think that it's incredibely rude to NOT invite the long time partner as a +1 for a wedding. It's just not something that is okay. Even if you only invite 40 persons. And it seems like a punishment to her: she has to be there alone without her long time partner (6 years is a long time), with 2 of her ex-partner there WITH their spouses.\n\nLike I said, absolutely YTA", "If that\u2019s the case, YTA. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a random boyfriend if she\u2019s been with him for 6 years.

I never want to have to meet him or even know his name, and if you break those rules, I will have nothing to do with you.\n\nIf you were willing to agree to those terms--and I doubt you would be--you'd have to police every word out of your mouth and make sure you didn't accidentally mention anything in relation to that person. I mean, why bother even having the relationship in the first place? Why not tell her the truth: Mom, I will never ever forgive you for not staying married to dad or step dad and I will never forgive you for having relationships with other men, and I will never believe that you will have romantic relationship that could work out for you and so I don't want anything to do with you. You fall in and out of love too easily for my taste and therefore I think you aren't worth the time or effort I have to put in to actually have a relationship with someone like you.\n\nI mean, you're only willing to see her 3 or 4 times a year as it is, so clearly you don't like her much, or maybe it's that you don't respect her. You clearly think she's entirely at fault for the divorces and your dad and stepdad carry no blame (and heck, maybe she is), so why bother with her at all?", "Dont listen to these bozos, my moms this way and protect your peace on your day.

This is me saving my own sanity from getting attached to someone then hurt if they go away or dealing with relationship drama because the guy turns out to be a bad person and I had to hear about it ALL THE TIME when I'm around my mother. I would have enough empathy to understand how my love life affects my children and I would honor their wishes. \n\nMy mother CHOSE to come back into my life after I laid out those terms and she realized I meant business and wouldn't be her emotional dumping ground. She didn't have to and I would have been fine if she decided her love life is more important than her kids - which clearly it is. That's fine, I'm an adult and I have a lot of other positive female role models in my life.

She's been with him for 6 years, not 6 weeks or 6months.\n\nYou've said in a few of your comments that it's not punishment, but it does come across that way. You seem to resent your mom for things she's done in the past and that's okay. She hurt you and that's fair. But at least be honest in that your boundaries are based on behavior that's years in the past and not necessarily a reflection of who she is now. Do you know who she is now? Do you even want to? She's been with this guy for 6 years and you can't meet him once because she had shorter term boyfriends years ago? That's a bit unreasonable to me.", "It's your wedding, invite who you want to. \n\nBut stop pretending like a 6 year long relationship is some one night stand. She's been with this one nearly as long as you've been in your current relationship. \n\nYou're mad that she left your dad and then your step dad for petty, shitty reasons, uprooted your life, and was a terrible role model for how a healthy and stable relationship should work, and you're punishing her for it. Probably deservedly so. But stop pretending you're doing this because she's with the flavor of the week.", "N T A for not wanting your wedding to be the place to meet a new partner or for specific guest list. Honestly yes, your wedding your way. \n\nBased on ALL the back ground you provided, I would say it's a soft YTA for this super hard boundary that you put down where you never ever want to meet or hear about a new partner of your mom's (which is NOT the problem here, since we love boundaries). BUT this guy isn't new, this partner has been with her for 6 YEARS - in the tech world 6 years is ancient - so personally I don't understand why you wouldn't take up her offer to meet him.\n\nHonestly not even talking about the wedding here, just in general, especially since you make it seem like she has been respectful of your boundary - you didn't even know she was dating him for 6 YEARS which means she probably has never brought up her dating life to you again. The situation of why the boundary was in place has changed so I don't see why the boundary can't involve. \n\nTo put it in perspective, if 4 years ago, when you were in year 6 of dating your partner, would you or your partner not be upset if your partner had to 'hide' you from their family or be told that you can't go to anything involving that family since you're never going to be seen as an important person in their family's eyes?", "Esh. Your mom has done you no favors, but the same could be said for you.", "NTA", "You are NTA. It is YOUR wedding, if it was any other day, sure maybe suck it up if its not important. But on your wedding you shouldnt have to lessen the boundary you set for your mother. You said it was a intimate event so why invite someone you will have met once? Thats not fair on you to look back on your wedding and be reminded of your mothers current fling. So set the boundary with your mother again. Remind her of it and be firm with her. It sounds like you arent missing out if she doesnt come.", "Ultimately NTA as it is your wedding. However, I personally think you are in the wrong. Your mom is asking for her BF of 6 years to attend your wedding. She has to sit their surrounded by both her exes and their SOs and to me not allowing her someone to be with her is cruel. I think you may be punishing your mom for how she treated you when you were younger. Your post didn\u2019t indicate anything specific to me that said she was a bad mom (ie abuse or cheating) just she made poor relationship choices. \n\nAgain ultimately it is your wedding and you get to choose the guest list but if having your mom at your wedding is important to you I would allow her to bring her BF. If you don\u2019t care if she is there than do what you want. However, if I was your mom I would not attend. It doesn\u2019t sound like the two of you have a great relationship anyway.", "NTA.  Should have just told Mom she could have picked up a single guy at the wedding, as usual.", "Honestly I think you need to distinguish the hurt you felt as a kid when she broke up with your 2 father figures from what would happen now if they broke up. You are an adult, not a kid. Her break ups are her business, and don\u2019t impact you directly. Expecting someone to come to a wedding with her two exes there with their new wives is ALOT. Expecting her to suck it up to put you first feels like you are trying to play out some drama and feelings you have left over from feeling hurt/abandoned as a kid by her breaking up your home. Divorce happens, it sucks for the kids but so does an unhappy marriage. Feels like time to go back to therapy", "NAH.  I understand laying down the rules on your wedding day, but how long as you going to keep\nyour mom on trial for?", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't invite either of them. Do you need that kind of drama?\n\nShe should take her guilt trips and shove them up her ass.", "Yes, it's weird that OP has been refusing to meet this guy for six years, and then says that he can't come to the wedding because they don't know him, when there was no way of getting to know him in the first place.", "See my update. In my email telling her he can come I did exactly that. I reminded her why I feel the way I do and why this boundary exists.", "It wasn't exactly what I said but I agree with you that I was a bit rude in my reasoning.", "The thing is, OP has been refusing to meet him for the past six years. So they will never know him, I guess.", "She has been with her partner for 6 years. This says a lot about you.", "I think it's OP's big day and wants their mother to be there without her boyfriend to make up for all the times she brought her boyfriends and didn't have quality time with her because of that.  I think OP wants to have their mother's undivided attention on their big day.", "And you too.  You're no fun at all!", "Yep, it seems more like a revenge issue on behalf of the other 2 who are there with their spouses.
