I have since remarried and have two  sons (14, 8). When I divorced my first husband I made it clear that I was no longer interested in coparenting his daughter (Lindsey, 23). Lindsey's mother wasn't in the picture, but I was only in her life for a few years at that point so it was not like she was losing a mother figure. I still talk to her occasionally and send her birthday gifts here and there. Lindsey is a bit of a wild child. She has had some problems with the law and overall is unmotivated to do anything meaningful with her life. My ex  and Lindsey, as of recently, are no longer on speaking terms. Lindsey came to me because I guess she had no where else to go. She asked if she could stay with me for a while until she was back on her feet. I ended up saying yes, because I couldn't imagine her surviving in the alternative.\n\nThat was 2 months ago. Lindsey still hasn't moved out or found a job but she does do chores around the house and help the kids with their homework. My kids have started to connect with Lindsey a bit. My husband however, is not exactly okay with her presence. A few days ago he asked me why she was still here. I informed him once again of her situation but he did not seem to care. He told me he did not want a \"criminal\" around his influential children. Lindsey has had a few addictions but I'm sure that she wouldn't do it in front of the kids. I tried to explain to my husband about second chances but he wasn't having it. He called me a doormat and said he wanted Lindsey out of the house in the next 2 weeks. Additionally, my ex is not exactly happy about Lindsey staying with me. He thinks that I am ruining her by not letting her learn life lessons. My husband is weaponizing this and telling me that I should stop telling other people how to parent.

You said it\u2019s been 2 months and she doesn\u2019t even have a job, so clearly she\u2019s made no progress whatsoever on finding her own place. How long were you planning on letting her live with you?", "YTA\n\nYour husband has valid concerns, it is time she left.\n\nShe is making no effort to find a job or somewhere to live. She will be here this time next year, Your husband and kids may not be though.", "YTA \n\n1. brought Lindsay without discussing with your husband \n2. if Lindsay had trouble with the law , specially addiction and she spends time with the kids ....this is a bit dangerous  \n3. its been 2 months and she aint doing nothing to get back on her feet . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou need to grow up and prioritise your husband and kids ...not Lindsay ......this time ..YOU are the problem", "This is an awkward one, and I'm not sure if it's the actual judgement you are asking for.\n\nYTA;  not for providing a place for her to live - but because letting someone live with you is a all yes or 1 no answer.\n\nyour husband, is saying no;  but you are fighting it.  That's what makes you TA here.\n\nRegarding your ex, that's tough.  I'm going to share a personal experience here.\n\nMy parents are divorced - they split up when I was 2, so I was never old enough to see them together.  To be clear though:  they are both failures at life.  They had me at 28/29 - so not a teen pregnancy or anything.  But both of them, have largely failed at everything they've done at life.\n\nWhy did they get to kept failing?  Their parents, kept bailing them out of their issues.  \n\nSo, I'm not saying I agree with your ex - as there is far too much details/nuance needed.  However I can sympathize that sometimes - you need people to hit bottom and figure things out on their own.", "Sorry but YTA\n\n First of all, your husband has a say over who lives in the house too, it's not just your house. Second of all, if this girl does drugs or has a concerning behaviour, why do you think it's a good idea to have her around your (step)children?? \n\n>has had a few addictions but I'm sure that she wouldn't do it in front of the kids\n\nLol. \n\n>I tried to explain to my husband about second chances but he wasn't having it.\n\nThe girl is no one to him, of course he wouldn't care. \n\n>he wanted Lindsey out of the house in the next 2 weeks.\n\nThen it's settled.", "YTA - I say this as a daughter and ex-wife of an alcoholic: they will do it in front of your kids. \n\nThat being said, having a former criminal and addict in your home, around your kids, is a \u201c2 yes or it\u2019s a no\u201d kind of situation. If Lindsey is estranged from her father and your husband is ill at ease, it\u2019s like they see something you either don\u2019t or are willfully ignoring. In either case, the kids come first. If there\u2019s a possibility this wont end well, for addiction or lack of drive, it\u2019s better to cut this off now. She isn\u2019t looking to better advance herself, she isn\u2019t applying herself, she\u2019s already reneging on your agreement. \n\nTalk to your husband and see if you can negotiate a hard 30 days for her to get herself together. Then lay hard boundaries and set expectations. Lindsey is burning bridges, don\u2019t get caught in that fire.", "YTA. You never should have said yes  to Lindsey before discussing this with your husband.", "If Lindsey struggles with addiction, your current husband does have valid concerns. Also, as your partner, you should both have been in agreement before she was allowed to stay with you.\n\nI know you mean well and want to help her, but YTA.", ">Lindsey has had a few addictions but I'm sure that she wouldn't do it in front of the kids.\n\nShe's an addict? You're letting an addict be around your children? Just how irresponsible are you?\n\nYTA, what the fuck.", "Yta it isn\u2019t weaponizing, it\u2019s two people who are right and you\u2019re wrong. \n\nYou can\u2019t just invite strangers to your family to live with you. This is a huge bad judgment call from you and I think your husband should re consider if you\u2019re responsible enough to be making parenting decisions about your boys.", "YTA. Well intentioned maybe, but it sounds like you invited Lindsey to come live with you without getting your husband's input or agreement.  And you admit she has a 'few' addictions but seem naively sure she wouldn't do anything in front of your kids. Both your husband and your ex are right--she needs to go.", "YTA for the following reasons.\n\n1) Your husband's concerns are very real. Don't dismiss them.\n2) Your ex is also right, you are setting Lindsey  up to not face failures.\n3) Lindsey is an adult and she needs to learn to fend for herself and be financially independent.\n4) You are enabling her and dismissing her failures.\n5) Someone with a criminal record shouldn't be near kids.\n6) She is using you. This has nothing to do with second chances. \n\nYou better kick her out or you will be a twice-divorced mother probably fighting for custody of her children.", "YTA... \n\n\"She asked if she could stay with me for a while until she was back on her feet. I ended up saying yes,\" you were already the Ahole right here. This was never your decision to make. You don't live with just you. The correct answer would be I talked it over with my husband and we agreed or said no. \n\nThe rest of this story doesn't help much. 2 months is a long time to not have a job for an adult who needs to be contributing. Then you tell us both your husband and her father aren't happy about this. You may have good intentions but it's clear you railroaded everyone with your mama bear energy and it's likely that your husband and her father are far more correct in their assessment than you.\n\nShe needs help, not enabling. It seems like you need to either respect your husband wish here or have a long hard talk with both of them and come to am agreement on expectations. A job, you helping her job search so she can't fake it. Therapy is neccessary. Rehab if neccessary. All those things. Plus doing some chores is cool, but if she is staying for free she should be doing almost every chore and then some.", "YTA\n\nAs an ex-wife of an addict and an aunt of an addict and friend to several addicts, they will steal from you, they will do it when your kids are around, and they will manipulate you.  You can't allow this to continue, you say she's better now, but she isn't going to work, you are enabling her.  Even if it's a grocery store, she has to work or she will go back.  Is she attending any AA or NA meetings?  If not, she may relapse easier.  Just protect your children and listen to your husband.  Two more weeks is reasonable.", "You decided not to be a parent to her, which is fine. Wanting to support her is also fine. But you're ignoring the person who actually does know her, and you've decided to enable her. She's using substances, not working, not doing anything to make her life better, and despite your husband not being okay with it, you think it's okay to continue letting her not have to deal with those issues. You're also teaching your kids that they don't have to be responsible for themselves as adults by doing this. The only person benefitting here is you, because you get to feel like her savior. Meanwhile everyone else, including your former stepdaughter, is suffering for it. YTA.", "YTA - because you didn\u2019t have a plan and a timeline for Lindsey to get motivated to get out.  You offered her a port in a storm and she turned it  into a permanent hammock.  You like her spending time with your children, but she is an addict and not going to any support groups, so she is Likely to start using again if she hasn\u2019t already.\n\nShe is 23 and an adult.  It is time for her to accept that she has adult responsibilities.  You are not holding her accountable for her decisions or getting a job.  You thought that her having a nice safe place to live would motivate her to get a job.  It didn\u2019t, it made her lazy because she is getting everything handed to her like she was still a child.  She is an adult and there are plenty of job openings out there.  She doesn\u2019t want to work and you aren\u2019t making her work.\n\nYou are not helping her.  You are enabling her to be dependent on you.  If you want to help her, then sit her down and explain that as an adult, she needs to choose a career path based on what her interests are, and then look for a job that will get her into that career path.  If she isn\u2019t sure, then get any job, including food service if she has to because she needs to earn money and save it and work her way up into a better job.  Sit down with her and go through the job websites with her looking at potential jobs and applying for ones that sound interesting.  See if she has a bank account, if she does, talk to her about having a checking account to pay bills and a savings account to save for the future.  Talk to her about saving 10% -25% of every pay check and automatically transferring that from her checking account into her savings account.  Step her through basic life skills of getting a job, saving her money, and paying bills.  Hold her accountable for doing all of these things.\n\nShe is one of those people who chooses not to figure this out and not to do anything because she can always sweet talk someone into doing for her.  You are her latest \u201cmark\u201d.  If she refuses to do all of these things with you, she wasn\u2019t interested in getting a job she was just interested in a nice safe home until you figured out she didn\u2019t want to work and kick her out.\n\nShe is acting like a teenager, and I suspect emotional intelligence is about 15 even though she is physically 23.  Think about it, she is doing all the things a 15 yr old would do and none of the things a 23 yr old would do\u2026", "YTA even if your motives are kind and unselfish.  \n\nMy hubby and I would have VERY serious problems if he moved someone into my home without asking me and tthen also continued to allow it after I said no.  This is a divorce worthy issue, and you just think it's fine?  Wow.", "YTA You get move someone when your partner is uncomfortable with them being there.   \n\nWould you like he bought a stranger into your with all the problems your stepdaughter has and said that person was going to stay there indefinitely ?\n\nYou are just enabling your stepdaughter.", "YTA.", "YTA.  This is your husband's house as well, yet he doesn't get a say as to whether or not he lives with your ex's kid?   I guess you want to add another divorce to your life?", "You were N T A when you let Lindsey stay with you, but now? It's been two months. Her situation didn't change and it looks like she doesn't try to change it, so I think YTA\n\nINFO - who pays the bills? Do you work? Does Lindsay contribute financially?", "Oh no. At first I thought you were being amazingly generous, then you mentioned the addiction part. I know you're trying to be generous but you're putting your family at risk. Even if she never does anything directly in front of the kids, if needles or paraphernalia,  ANYTHING is found in your home, you could be deemed unfut and have your children removed. All it takes is one loose comment from your kids to a teacher to get that process started. Or a parole agent to make a report. Really, you can't have a known addict in your home like that. Plus if your husband isn't on board, this risks your children's current stability. He could divorce you and make a case for sole custody. \n\nThere are better ways to help this girl. You tried your way, it didn't work. So it's time to get her help somewhere else. Until then, YTA", "YTA\n\nAddicts will use everyone they can and you will damage your family. It is better for Lindsey to go to rehab and take responsibility for herself. You are just delaying her from taking responsibility for her life. It's enablement, not compassion. I live in the city and see it daily & have had addiction hit my family. This is not a solution, but a bandaid.", "This was a discussion you should have had with your husband before saying yes. You didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why YTA.", "YTA. Your husband has as much say as you do any he let her stay for two months. Maybe ask him if as a compromise she can have a month but you need to tell her she needs to be out by X date, then you need to evict her if she isn\u2019t. She\u2019s probably lived with you long enough to have rights so look into that before just throwing her out.", "At this point, YTA. Others have done a great job of explaining why.\n\nI will say, however, that the 2-week notice may not be legal. Lindsey may technically be a tenant, and therefore protected by law. You may have to go through an eviction process. Check with an attorney. \n\nBeyond that, if you want to help Lindsey, then get involved with her job search. Make sure she's getting therapy and support for her addictions. Give her a timeline for moving out based on what you find out about your state's tenant laws and help her stick to it. \n\nGood luck!", "YTA\n\nSomeone moving in or staying in your house its a 2 yeses or 1 no. Your husband doesn\u2019t want her there anymore, doesn\u2019t matter the circumstances, she needs to put her shit together and move out.", "It's been two months and she's not made any efforts. She's not going to as long as she is enabled. If she had taken steps, i.e. found work, I could see giving her more time, but she hasn't. It's time for her to go. It's also time for you to stop meddling. When you got divorced, you stated you didn't want to co-parent, so stop trying 10 years later.\nYTA", "It would be nice if there were more doormats in the world.", "I'm sorry, you are trying to do a good thing, but YTA\n\nA married couple having a houseguest requires 2 Yes votes. I would work with her to get her back on her feet, OUTSIDE your home.\n\nYour Ex's opinion has no bearing on my judgement. His kid is 23, her decisions are her own if nothing else. It's not your role to enforce parenting as he wants.", "An addict will.\n\nAnytime you are finding the words, \"I don't think she would...\" \n\nAn addict will.  \n\nThey will steal from you, lie to you, and assault you and whomever else they have to in order to feed their addiction.\n\nIf she is in recovery, who is involved in that?  Probation? Counseling?\n\nBecause you CANNOT fix her by yourself, and your minor children have a right to your protection.", "YTA", "You need to chose soon as it sounds like your husband is done with this. Your family or Lindsey?", ">He called me a doormat and said he wanted Lindsey out of the house in the next 2 weeks.\n\nTrue, true\n\n> Additionally, my ex is not exactly happy about Lindsey staying with me. \n\nTrue, true\n>He thinks that I am ruining her by not letting her learn life lessons. \n\nTrue, true                    =\nYTA", "I'm all for second chances, but it's been two months and she still isn't trying.  Time for her to go.  \n\nYour husband has very valid reasons to not want her around.", "YTA. You shouldn't invite long term houseguests without mutual consent. Not cool.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYour husband isn't comfortable with her in your home and with your JOINT kids. That's it, that's the story, and that's reason enough. \n\nYou can help her in other ways.", "Damn. I think NTA. Sometimes people need hard life lessons and tough love. Sometimes all people need is love and support and to know that someone is in their corner. Despite not being related, and no longer her stepmother, you took her in to help her because it was better than seeing her on the streets where so much bad stuff could happen. \n\nMaybe try and help Lindsey get on her feet, find a job, start saving some money? Honestly at 23 I didn\u2019t know what to do with my life, or how to be an adult. I wasn\u2019t taught the skills. If she purposely tries not to find a job then maybe it might be time to find alternative accommodation. I wouldn\u2019t just throw her out on the streets. I\u2019d help her find somewhere she could be safe. Your ex has no say in whether or not you help her because she\u2019s a grown adult and can talk to who she likes. I agree with not letting her be a mooch and live off of you and be her doormat, but at the same time these men clearly want her out in the streets and don\u2019t seem to care what happens to her. That\u2019s so wrong, mostly from her dad since he\u2019s her dad. Is her dad finally going to be happy if she ends up dead in an alleyway somewhere?", "YTA\n\nI don't necessarily agree with your husband's read on the situation, but you both need to be on the same page before having long term guests in your home. You aren't, so she has to go.", "YTA. You have very good intentions, but poor execution. You shouldn\u2019t let someone in your home without your husbands permission. And if she hasn\u2019t already found a job, she isn\u2019t going to do so. I suggest helping her find a rehabilitation center or a sober living facility.", "NTA initially but there has to be a reasonable exit plan for Lindsey.  She's 23.  She needs to find a job and figure out a way to support herself.  You've given her a wonderful opportunity to reset, but it's unfair to your husband to have her in the house forever. \n\nY WBTA if you let this continue indefinitely.  Sit her down and formulate a strategy with your husband present.", "Imma buck trend and say NTA, this is a young woman you've known for over 10 years since she was a small child, it's only been 2 months and it can take awhile to find a place hiring anyone with a criminal record, and she's not doing nothing, she's helping out with childcare and household chores. Your kids have bonded with her. How would your kids feel about this person who's been helping take care of them being homeless? Lindsey won't learn anything from being homeless she'll just get hurt, being homeless isn't an educational experience.", "Your heart is in the right place, but your actions are questionable.  At the very least, continuing to live in your home should require her to get a job and pay something for rent.  There also should be no allowance for any drug use, whether or not it is in front of your children.  Attendance to a 12-step program could reasonably be a part of this.  \n\nI'm going to say NAH at this point,  but if you don't make her living there more conditional on getting her life in order, then YTA", "INFO: Has she been breaking the law while living with you or glorifying it to the kids? Does she seem to be doing better with you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am leaning towards NTA. 23 is still developmental age so she may have been acting out with her dad and if he didn't know how to connect with her that may be making things hard. Also, there's no reason for your husband to call you a doormat ever.", "NTA. Your husband sounds a bit callous but he\u2019s also not wrong, if it\u2019s true that she has addictions. Be careful around addicts; you can easily enable them. I\u2019d need more details to know if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. \n\nYour compassion is admirable and it sounds like you can see the good in anyone. I hope that no matter what happens with your step daughter you never lose that quality.", "NTA. I do think you need a compromise and game plan for her. Does she need mental health support? Does she need job training or education? Support groups? Meetings? \n\nHelp her make and implement a plan and give her a specific timeframe. Hopefully this is a win-win for her and your husband.", ">my ex is not exactly happy about Lindsey staying with me.\n\nThis doesnt matter. Its not your ex's house, its your house. Lindsey is an adult, you are an adult, this isn't really a parenting issue. So your husband saying, \n\n>I should stop telling other people how to parent.\n\nIs not valid either. Again, this isn't a parenting issue so much as a being a decent human being issue. \n\nAnd you have been a decent human being to Lindsey. Any family connection is tenuous at best. You let her stay with you to get back on her feet and she has behaved herself well. So no one has done anything wrong at this point. \n\nYour husband is right to ask why Lindsey is still there. Two months is plenty of time to reset, reflect and plan your next move. But Lindsey seems to have settled in as a light housekeeper/nanny, which isn't what was signed up for. Its unfair to ask him to pay Lindsey's rent and keep indefinitely. There needs to be a plan for her to get a job, save up money and get her own place. I'm not a huge fan of throwing people out on the street to teach them a lesson. But your husband deserves a say in who lives in your space as much as you do. \n\nNTA, but if you keep Lindsay there at the cost of the relationship with your husband you would become the AH. Talk to Lindsey about an exit strategy.", "I lean NTA, because I have a lot of empathy for the unhoused. I think you need to make the rules of her living with you clear. She's expected to have a part time job and contribute x$ to the household. (Even if you just pocket the money and give it back to her when she moves out as a first and last month rent).\n\nShe needs some firm guidelines and your family needs it too.", "Ok, you messed up by saying yes without checking with your husband first. But having empathy is nothing to be ashamed of. You have a heart and acted on it. \n\nNow you need to sort this out in order to not destroy your marriage. I would have a positive chat with her and explain as nice as possible that she needs to learn to take care of herself and you will help her so she doesn\u2019t feel overwhelmed by \u201cbeing kicked out\u201d. First of all help her find a job and then help her find a place of her own, even if it\u2019s shared. Talk to your husband about the plans to help her and for him to please be patient as it might take more than two weeks. \n\nYou clearly care for her and your kids seem to like her. It seems that she\u2019s not a bad person, she just had a rough life as a kid. She\u2019s prob enjoying to learn what it\u2019s like to live and be part of a loving family for the first time. Ask your husband to have a bit of empathy. She deserves a second chance!", "NTA for being kind, but you were definitely TA for having your step-daughter move into your family home without your husband onboard.  You need to get Lindsey into another living arrangement or you can probably count on having yet another ex.  Your lack of thoughtful communication with your spouse is alarming and appalling.  You really need to apologize to your husband for your lack of thought for him and his feelings.", "NTA, you took in someone who needed help. She helps around the house and even helps the kids with their homework. I can understand the concerns your husband has, but at the same time second chances are important. Maybe Lindsey should try to get a job if she\u2019s not already trying, however I don\u2019t think you should kick her out. Maybe if she gets a job it\u2019ll show your husband she\u2019s trying. Idk", "I can\u2019t see AHs here to be honest\n\nYou\u2019re a good person, wanted to help a young women out, if you still want to help, maybe help her find some resources so she can help herself\n\nLindsey seem to be influenced by you in a good way, you helping here seems to had made a good impression, slowly maybe but she is trying\n\nYou husband have some very valid concerns, also he doesn\u2019t own this woman anything, he is just trying to look up for his family\n\nYour ex maybe right to try to teach her a lesson, maybe not in the best fashion, but none the less trying something (maybe out if desperation)\n\nMaybe this idea would be to your liking (just trying to help here), if your house economy allows it, help her find a shelter and employ her as a house keeper?, you can set some rules (she need to be clean, get some treatment for her addictions, her keeping a cordial communication with his father in case of emergencies,etc)\n\nEdit: typo", "Don't be sure Lindsey wouldn't do drugs in front of the kids.  She can and might.\n\nYNTA but your husband has a point.  Lindsey is not your blood, you owe her nothing, and she is a grown ass adult.  You cannot rescue her.  She has to rescue herself.  On top of that, there are two of you in this marriage and you have kids with this man.  Do not sacrifice your marriage for somone else's child.  Lindsey needs to be told its time to go.  Since she hasn't bothered to find a job or start school, where she goes or how she supports herself is not your problem.  You can give her some cash if you want to ... but out of your funds not the household funds unless your hubs approves (he won't) and only as she's walking out the door.\n\nThe way things are now, she will never leave unless you force her to.  It's past time you did.\n\nMake sure you get the keys back and change the locks in any case.  You don't want to find her sitting on the sofa when you come home one day.", "NTA in the least. \nyou\u2019re a lifeline to her and your modelling caring empathetic behaviour to your children. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re putting anybody at risk, and it sounds like she\u2019s being helpful. Your husband has the right to express his concern and maybe you need a longer conversation about this. Like, you probably can\u2019t decide unilaterally to let her stay there forever. \n\nbut your ex is estranged from his daughter and it\u2019s not his call to make.

I have since remarried and have two  sons (14, 8). When I divorced my first husband I made it clear that I was no longer interested in coparenting his daughter (Lindsey, 23). Lindsey's mother wasn't in the picture, but I was only in her life for a few years at that point so it was not like she was losing a mother figure. I still talk to her occasionally and send her birthday gifts here and there. Lindsey is a bit of a wild child. She has had some problems with the law and overall is unmotivated to do anything meaningful with her life. My ex  and Lindsey, as of recently, are no longer on speaking terms. Lindsey came to me because I guess she had no where else to go. She asked if she could stay with me for a while until she was back on her feet. I ended up saying yes, because I couldn't imagine her surviving in the alternative.\n\nThat was 2 months ago. Lindsey still hasn't moved out or found a job but she does do chores around the house and help the kids with their homework. My kids have started to connect with Lindsey a bit. My husband however, is not exactly okay with her presence. A few days ago he asked me why she was still here. I informed him once again of her situation but he did not seem to care. He told me he did not want a \"criminal\" around his influential children. Lindsey has had a few addictions but I'm sure that she wouldn't do it in front of the kids. I tried to explain to my husband about second chances but he wasn't having it. He called me a doormat and said he wanted Lindsey out of the house in the next 2 weeks. Additionally, my ex is not exactly happy about Lindsey staying with me. He thinks that I am ruining her by not letting her learn life lessons. My husband is weaponizing this and telling me that I should stop telling other people how to parent. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
