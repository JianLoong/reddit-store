She has always helped at animal shelters, fostered cats, etc.. She also has a plethora of cat related items. I (26M), on the other hand, don\u2019t consider myself to be a cat or dog person. I like them both.\n\nMy wife has always been anti-dog and is very active in anti-dog subreddits (hence the throwaway. I don\u2019t want her to know I\u2019m writing this). This has never really bothered me, but I always thought she should give dogs a chance before she decides if she hates them or not (She\u2019s never had a pet dog, only cats. We also currently do not have any pets, since our cat passed away in January.)\n\nLast weekend was her birthday, and I thought  it would be a cute idea to get a puppy from the shelter. I figured that not only would she be able to give dogs a chance, but she can have a new furry friend.\n\nI tell her I have a present for her and give her a box with the puppy in it (don\u2019t worry, he wasn\u2019t in there for long and he had plenty of air holes). She got super excited because she saw the holes and thought it was a cat. When she opened it, she frowned and asked what this is. The conversation went like this:\n\nWife: What is this?\n\nMe: It\u2019s a puppy! I thought you could have a new friend to cuddle with!\n\nWife: You know I don\u2019t like dogs. I don\u2019t want to take care of it.\n\nMe: I know you don\u2019t, but we can work together and maybe your opinion will change. He\u2019s really sweet, you\u2019ll like him.\n\nBasically, she cried and told me that shes angry with me. She said she doesn\u2019t want to take care of some \u201cugly rat dog\u201d (He\u2019s a chihuahua). She has since locked herself in her office and is now sleeping on the pullout in there.\n\nEver since her birthday, she has been short with me and refuses to even look at the dog. Everytime she sees him she looks disgusted.\n\nI told some friends about this and they said that she\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d for not liking dogs. \n\nMy brother said I\u2019m an asshole for getting her the dog despite knowing she hates them.\n\nI just wanted to help her feel a little but better about losing her cat, but now I feel like crap.\n\nTL;DR: I got my wife a dog to help her cope with the loss of her cat even though she hates dogs", "created_utc": 1689273251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ysm63/aita_for_getting_my_wife_a_dog/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wouldn\u2019t it be logical to eventually pick out a cat or kitten when you are both ready? I\u2019m glad you realized you were wrong in this situation. I hope you can find a good home for the pup", "You are TA and owe your wife the biggest apology. It\u2019s just so incredibly disrespectful and condescending to assume you can \u201cwork together\u201d to CHANGE HER. It sounds like she\u2019s been very clear with you with her stance on dogs yet you still thought \u201chm instead of getting her a new, furry kitten..I\u2019m gonna go with a DOG\u201d (which is btw like 1,000000x\u2019s time, attention, training, care, etc forever)", "Are you al least going to rehome the dog? None of this means anything if the dog is still around bothering her.", "You're an asshole for surprising her about a dog, your friends are an asshole for being rude about your wife, you and your wife should probably work on communication. Maybe get a big active cat if you want a dog so badly, something like a Bengal.", "Why don\u2019t you like dogs?", "A lot of people are afraid of dogs. They're a huge financial responsibility (we are leaving the country, boarding our dog is 2x more expensive than the apartment we're renting). They're messy (I have to vacuum daily) and loud and puppies destroy things. My dog is a part of my family but I understand that he isn't for everyone.", "like a lot of people.. dogs are just in general annoying and gross", "Dogs are incredibly smart animals and among the best in the animal kingdom in reading humans. Most of them are annoying whiny kids who also suck up to their owners.", "She's an adult, but not a mature one, mature adults don't feel a need to seek out social media platforms to encourage their own personal hatred towards specific animal speices, these subreddits are riddled with pro animal abuse behaviour and even encourage abuse when they see said animal in person, even if your wife doesn't condone animal abuse, she is happily following these subreddits that are appropriating it and not doing much to monitor it.\n\nIt IS a red flag, having strong hatred for dogs/cats is linked to issues of controlling and anger issues in general.", "Honestly, if this story is true, he probably didn\u2019t even admit he had a wife. Most shelters insist on the entire family being there to meet the animal to make sure it\u2019s a good fit.", "This is highly dependent on location and organization. The stray pet problem in the Southern US is way worse than in Northern states, so many shelters down here are constantly at capacity and basically just in a hurry to rehome as many pets as possible. My local municipal shelter, for example, is required by law to accept any animal that comes their way, so they really can\u2019t afford to be choosy. I adopted a dog from them and they asked almost no follow-up questions. By contrast, when we considered adopting from a private rescue, they wanted to do an interview and a home visit. Private rescues have the luxury of keeping individual animals as long as they need to.", "That's an awesome way to do it!", "Your partner is awesome.", "Someone could have already had an animal picked out that they wanted. You get that for them and help get whatever extra things they haven't gotten yet when you pick it up\n\nOr buy all the stuff for them and help them pick out a pet\n\nIt's not an issue when you know the person and what they want and do it responsibly", "i think its one of those things where you have to know the person youre giving the pet to. \n\ni know that i, personally, would be thrilled to receive a puppy as a present from my partner, but i also know i could trust my partner to choose a dog id be compatible with (both in space needs, monetary needs, physical needs since i cant handle big dogs, and the breed itself since im allergic to quite a few breeds). dogs are a huge commitment, one that i personally would be happy taking on, but not everyone is and thats okay too. \n\nif you know your partner would be 100% thrilled to get a pet as a gift i think its okay, but you have to be like 110% sure and you also have to at least know a breed they\u2019d be happy with. \n\na better way may be gifting them a puppy basket of toys n stuff and then taking them to pick out which dog they want rather than just choosing for them imo, but again its a \u201cknow your person\u201d situation", "I plan to have dogs. I grew up with terriers. And I eventually want a Boston. So what am I doing? I\u2019m planning around it. I know what I can do as a responsible pet owner and I know now is not the time. I also know I would not be a good cat owner. So what will I not do? Get a cat.", "I like dogs. I want to pet all the dogs. I don't want to take one home with me. They are too much work, especially puppies.", "Yeah. Chihuahuas aren't the best  dog for people who hate dogs.", "Some shelters are very strict but other shelters are very lenient. Especially with \u201cproblem\u201d dog breeds that are difficult to adopt out like chihuahuas and pitbulls due to their reputation to be problem pets. The most he might\u2019ve done could be as little as just checking a box that says everyone in the house is aware of the pet. This is my bet personally since it seems like he took them home same weekend he applied for a pet, and the \u2018good\u2019 shelters typically will never adopt out that quickly.", "The OP was such YTA, reminds me of those commercials where the husband surprises the wife with a new car on Christmas morning\u2026. But worse because its a living thing.", "I love animals in general but if anyone surprised me with any pet I'd be pissed. Taking on the care for an animal is something that should be seriously considered, it means investing time and money. OP is a major AH and an idiot.", "Satan rat \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Thank you for Satan rat. I'll be using this term to describe my mother's monster from now on.", "Depends on the cat because both of the rex cats (one Devon one Cornish) I've had as well as others people I know have had were always up our asses", "I love the way they smell like warm Fritos when they are all snuggled under the blanket with you. I used to have a pack of chis but alas now I just have my old gal left.", "> However, they do need a person. One person only.\n\nSee, I consider this work.  Emotional work, but work still.  You have to be ready to be a chihuahua's person, and that's a form of stepping up you don't have to be ready to do for a cat or a larger dog.  And to be clear, I was my late dog's #1 person and my cat's person.  But I didn't have to make that sort of anchoring commitment to them because they would be perfectly content with other people if I wasn't around.  They just preferred me if given the choice.\n\nThere's probably a better way to describe it, but being the \"person\" for a chihuahua is just more involved than many people (ESPECIALLY cat people) are looking for.  They may be fine with a dog where they can share the load with someone else, but a dog that needs them to be their anchor is just way more than they could ever sign up for.", "My husband and I have 2 chi mixes and we joke all the time that we have his and hers dogs, lol.  They both love both of us, but definitely 1 is more bonded to him and the other to me.", "Yes, I am. I\u2019m going to go to the shelter tomorrow morning.", "Yes but so are EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. It really boggles my mind that someone can not like a dog. They are so loving, they are wonderful and if not it is because THEY have been abused. You all need to have one day with a shelter dog tell me don\u2019t change your damn mind.", "Yes not for everyone I get that, but to hate dogs? Like, really! I don\u2019t even have a dog, I want one but they are\n1. Too expensive \n2. Don\u2019t have enough room would not be fair to the dog\n\nBut to actively dislike dogs??? What Is wrong with you?", "Ha! Ok then", "So are men and women", "Yes that sounds awful.", "Sorry, have you even seen some of the dogfree subreddits? I think you\u2019re just butthurt that someone doesn\u2019t like dogs.", "People are allowed to not like dogs or cats. I have always been a dog guy but had one cat when I was in my 20s I adopted because I found it as a kitten crossing a busy road and fell in love with him. He was the absolute coolest best cat I\u2019ve ever seen. But I would never get a cat again. I have 3 dogs now. Just because someone doesn\u2019t want to own a dog doesn\u2019t mean they are being abusive to anything. If anyone is it\u2019s OP for adopting a dog knowing his wife doesn\u2019t want it. And then in another comment saying he\u2019s taking it back to the shelter tomorrow. Wife could have gotten bit by a dog or had a bad experience who knows. But Jesus is your comment totally off context here.", "It was great, still a big surprise but I had every opportunity to say no before bringing a live animal home.", "Imo chihuahuas aren\u2019t the best dogs for a ton of people, even dog lovers. Tiny breeds get disrespected and neglected a lot because people think they don\u2019t need to train them, either because little dogs are stubborn and they won\u2019t learn/it\u2019s just how they are, or because if they act out it\u2019s not a big deal cause it\u2019s small. I mean picture all the viral videos of people antagonizing their toy dog breeds cause it\u2019s funny when they snap and nibble on their hand or get the ugly growl face or they have \u2018cute\u2019 quiet barks. Chihuahuas can be amazing dogs and they have a long historical significance and people treat them like shit when they *already* like dogs. I feel so bad for this puppy and for the wife for OP putting them in this situation.", "So in addition to alienating your wife, you needlessly traumatized a defenseless puppy.  Great job all around.", "returning it to the shelter is not the same as rehoming it", "REHOME DOESNT MEAN RETURN TO THE SHELTER", "I'm confused, why are you defending dog-free subreddits and your wife's actions, while also trying to justify getting her a pet she doesn't like?", "Can you read? I specifically state cat and dog hatred being a red flag in a person.", "I don't know what OP's shelter is like, but when we adopted our cat from our no-kill shelter, we signed an agreement stating if we ever gave up our cat up, that we would take him back to them and not rehome to a stranger that might abuse him. I think that is a generally accepted best practice unless it is a kill shelter. OP is YTA for adopting in the first place, but returning to the shelter is probably the most responsible decision.", "I\u2019m defending my wife. I\u2019m no longer justifying it. I realize I\u2019m wrong.\n\nI just don\u2019t like how this person is saying my wife is a red flag just because she hates dogs. Someone else made a comment how dog-haters are treated like they\u2019re the devil while cat-haters aren\u2019t. This person is treating my wife like a the devil.\n\nI may be an asshole but I am not going to let someone disrespect her.", "I like cats. While I don't hate dogs and I am fine with someone else having them, I do not want one of those in my house. Does that make it a red flag?\n\nGrow up.", "Having such a strong hate for an animal that you join groups specifically about hating the animal is not healthy. I hate bats. Absolutely terrified of them. I am not of a bat-free subreddit. Same with spiders, scorpions, and idk, probably hamsters.\n\nLol why am I being downvoted? It genuinely is not healthy to hate something so much that you join online groups over it.", "The red flag is being in subreddits about hating animals, not simply not liking a certain type of animal. What do they even do on those subreddits?", "You\u2019re being downvoted because you\u2019re a judgmental asshole. Live and let live. Hate and let hate. Some people wanna talk shit with people about a common disinterest. Really nothing unusual about that.", "Geniuenly what did the hamsters ever do to you? Such cute little fluff balls.", "talk about the struggles of living with them. its honestly not what you think it is", "I worked at a pet store and they were the only ones that ever drew blood on me. Also, they stink. But I don't hate them that much. They're just an animal doing what animals do."]}
