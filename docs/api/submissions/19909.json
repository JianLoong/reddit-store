I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m quite scared to post anything here, but here goes; \n\nMy boyfriend (33M) and I (25F) had a fight, and I\u2019m left wondering, if I just overreacted and am acting unreasonably as my bf claims. \n\nI gathered up the courage to dress up in a dress, which I really like, but am usually too shy/self concious to use, as it doesn\u2019t have sleeves or a high collar. I am quite muscular as I have a physical job and my hobbies revolve around sports as well. I\u2019ve also been bullied in my youth because of my big chest. Because of this, I often feel stupid wearing anything other than outdoor/work clothing, and rarely do it. \n\nMy boyfriend walked in to the room just as I\u2019d put the dress on, grabbed my boob and commented with a smirk \u201dIt\u2019s getting really tight from here\u201d. (Meaning the dress). \n\nHis comment stung. I know he didn\u2019t mean anything bad by it, but it made me feel bad nonetheless. I told him as much, but he just gave me a look that said \u201dreally\u201d. \n\nI ended up crying because I felt upset. I tried not to, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I told him again that his comment had not been nice, that he shouldn\u2019t say it like that. Bf got mad at me and told me to just f* off and go to a friend\u2019s house if I was being like this. \n\nHe then left the house (we live together) and came back really late in the evening, clearly avoiding me and not speaking to me. (That\u2019s normal when we have an argument.) He continued the silent treatement through the next day. I tried to strike up a conversation a few times, but he wouldn\u2019t respond. In the evening I told him that I was still upset about what he said, and that all I\u2019m asking for is a simple \u201dsorry\u201d. His response was that I\u2019m mentally ill, acting like a child and absolutely unreasonable for \u201dturning this into such a big deal\u201d. He claims that he hasn\u2019t offended me, but rather complimented. I told him that just as I can\u2019t decide when he feels offended or by what, he can\u2019t be the one to decide that for other people. The silent treatment is back on. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together for 10 years now, so I feel like he should know me quite well by now, and know that I am quite sensitive when it comes to comments about my body. \n\nAll I wanted was a simple \u201dsorry\u201d, or just any kind of aknowlegement on his part that his comment wasn\u2019t exactly nice.

He body shamed you and then got to make you feel bad for putting him in his place? Don't fall for that, girl. This is to me just another kind of emotional abuse. You have to be tough and let him know straight. Otherwise this will happen again", "You\u2019ve been together since you were 15 and he was 23? Bad news about your boyfriend, he sucks. You\u2019re NTA, and you should definitely be considering whether or not you\u2019re in healthy relationship (hint: nope)", "NTA you didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it, he did and now he is manipulating you and telling you that your feelings aren\u2019t valid. The fact that you started this relationship when you were a child and he was an adult is seriously concerning. An adult only dates a child when they want to groom that child into their perfect victim.", "NTA. Has he ever apologized or acknowledged that he has offended you? Does this happen on a regular basis? Are you happy with your relationship? It sounds like he normally punishes you with the silent treatment and ignoring you. Do you really want this to be your life going forward? There is much better out there for you. Don't hang on to this nasty dude just because he groomed you when you were a teenager. He was looking for someone young and malleable that he could control. Take back your life and get rid of him. No one who really loves you would treat you like that. You deserve better!!!!", "Back the f--- up.  You've been together since you were 15 and he was 23?  Sweetie, you're in a relationship with a sexual predator.  Go to a friend's house, your parents, your grandma's, anywhere, but get away from this piece of sludge.\n\nNTA.  I don't know who told you that muscles and tone on a woman are not sexy, but I work out and I love my muscle definition.\n\nGET.  OUT.  NOW.", "UHH NTA?! 10 years and he doesnt know how you feel about that typa comment? Id really think your relationship", ">My boyfriend (33M) and I (25F)\n\n>We\u2019ve been together for 10 years now\n\nSo wait you were 15 when you started dating him??? What the heck is wrong with him??? This is so gross omg, dating AN UNDERAGE TEENAGER at 23yo \ud83d\ude10\n\nNTA, this dude is a narcissistic pervert. Hissy fit, silent treatment and gaslihting? This is abuse. Do yourself a favor and get out of this abusive relationship as fast as you can.", "INFO how are you with a guy for 10 years at 25?\n\nAnyway, as you are mid twenties, and I\u2019ve said this plenty of other times, your 20\u2019s are for personal growth, and to make mistakes, learn from those mistakes, and take steps away from recommitting those mistakes.\n\nAfter 10 years [!] together, can you say you feel loved and adored? If you don\u2019t, then please stand up,straight, and pick you first. Pick your future, and pick your happiness as being your priority.\n\nYou are definitely young enough to create a whole new life. Consider where you could be in 6 months, with a changed focus and new goals. \n\nBe happy, be smart, be protective of yourself.", "NTA\n\nYikes. Storming off for hours and giving the silent treatment for even longer is not healthy behavior. It puts all the pressure on you to do the apologizing and convinces him that he's right and justified in his behavior. It also convinces you that your feelings are always wrong, which they absolutely are not. All you want is an apology for hurting your feelings and this is his reaction? Again, yikes.", "First gentle hugs for you. You just described narcissistic abuse. The silent treatment and gaslighting are classic behaviors. You need to leave him because narcissist rarely change for long. You deserve better. NTA", "He sounds like a child and a bully. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\n\nEven if your boyf meant what he said as a compliment, the appropriate response when he realises you were hurt by what he said is for him to apologise.  \n\n\nFor him to storm off and give you the silent treatment is a huge overreaction, and I hope you're reconsidering your relationship. You deserve so much better than someone who would treat you like that.", "1st wear as many dresses as yiu like. You look great in them.\n2nd your BF is a AH and he was 23 when you were 15. He groomed you. He is wrong and you deserve better. He is bad for you", "NTA - I think you were over sensitive, but that doesn\u2019t make you wrong. Everyone is allowed their quirks and insecurities and our partners should help build our confidence.\n\nEdit: When I see the age gap here and factor in that you were underage when the two of you began dating, I am seriously concerned.", "He is an arsehole, you are not.\nNo one should make you feel uncomfortable in your skin or your principals.\n\nI was with someone like this that made me feel like prey. \nPlease leave this arsehole on the kerb, get comfortable in your own skin and find someone that respects that", ">We\u2019ve been together for 10 years now,\n\n15 and 23!  OMG.", "NTA. I would recommend finding a new living situation. This guy is immature and manipulative. If it's not abuse yet, it will be soon. You can do so much better, and deserve someone who will cherish you. It's better to be single than with a person like that. Make your own single life as nice as you can, then only trade up.", "NTA,\n\nI think initially you might have overreacted because it was obvious he was finding you attractive. Not trying to invalidate your own reaction but I do think there was a misunderstanding there. Having said that\n\nWhat your boyfriend did after\u2026was 100% uncalled for and he\u2019s a huge ahole. If that\u2019s his reaction to something that could\u2019ve been resolved with \u201csorry, I\u2019d didn\u2019t mean it like that I meant this\u201d or something along those lines\u2026seriously need to reconsider your relationship with him. How will he react over bigger issues when they come up? He\u2019s being immature", "NTA. It is highly concerning that all of his behavior seems normal to you. It is not, and you do not deserve to be so used to it that it seems like it is.", "Worst case scenario he did it on purpose to put you down as he knows how you feel and knows you don't usually were this kind of clothes. He might even have been trying to get you to change.\n\nBest case scenario he really was goofing around and meant no harm but is still in the wrong for not showing some empathy as you explained why you felt hurt. Anyone half decent would feel bad and reassure you... \n\nOh and don't get me started on the childish silent treatment!\n\nNta clearly", "Is this a pattern? Does he often dismiss your feelings?", "NTA. Your BF was rude and he should acknowledge that fact.\n\nYour figure sounds fantastic.  Muscles and a large chest... to me, 57 F, I am jealous!  I bet you look lovely.  Your BF prolly isn't used to you dressing up and he might even feel a bit jealous bc other people will also find you attractive.\n\nHe was rude and unkind.  Save your money and consider your options.  The first serious BF you have in your life may not be your lifetime love.  Heck, I didn't meet mine until I was 34!\n\nAnd be kind to yourself. Maybe get counseling to help with your self-esteem if you can find a decent counselor.  Don't tell BF, he seems like that might intimidate him also and he will criticize you for that also.  Take good care of yourself.", "Withholding love is a form of abuse. He's also just an asshole. NTA, but this will never get better.

You're 10 years in. Another one or two and my guess is you won't want to have friends or family around bc he will have verbally beaten the desire to do so out of you for fear of his response. \n\nGTFO of thos relationship!\n\nNTA", "NTA. And what your BF has done can be called \"abuse\".", "I think its time to break up with him. NAH", "You're looking for something he'll never give you, kindness and respect. The rare occasion you get dressed up, he is probably jealous, wanted to feed into your insecurities he knows about so you wont do it again. He made a hurtful comment so you hide yourself in clothes less form fitting because he's insecure himself. The disappearing and silent treatment is disgusting. He probably picks fights to have an excuse in his mind to take off on you. He sounds horrible, there are people out there who will love you, communicate like an adult and appreciate every aspect of you. Please don't settle for this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
