The purpose of the trip was always drinking and maybe other stuff (no judgement) pregnant people cant/shouldnt do. This does not mean OP cares less for her friend, just that the plan needs to change.\n\nIf were planning on going on a trip to, lets say, ireland for saint patrick almost a year before, and the friends acompanying me where like \"oh  im pregnant now, but there are pretty churches and sightseeing we can see\" id also cancel the trip, as this was not what i signed up for. Nothing against the friend, or ireland, or churches or sightseeing... It was just not the plan.", "I\u2019m going to be downvoted but NTA. \n\nYou have no idea what her pregnancy will be like 3-4 months from now.  Will she be sick? Angry? Tired? Better to cancel now instead of pushing through when you won\u2019t have fun.\n\nI\u2019m with you on this.  Her being pregnant totally changes the trip.  You will definitely have to make some accommodations for her.  I think it\u2019s fair to cancel.", "NTA - when planning the trip you two were of same mind in terms of what the trip entailed.  Now with current/future circumstances you will not be wanting to do same activities as each other on the trip.", "INFO: What is she planning on doing now? If the point was to party and now she can't party, why is she still wanting to go?", "NTA - I get it.  You are literally planning a party trip, and now she can't party.  I say better you cancel and deal with the bad feelings now, as opposed to put money into the trip only for it to suck once you get there.  Y'all can still hang out and do things locally, and revisit the trip once her baby is old enough for her to leave with dad for a few days.", "NTA. \n\nHer pregnancy is changing the whole vibe of the trip you had planned.  You originally planned on cutting loose and partying.  If this hadn't been the plan from the start and it was more of a low-key hanging out affair, it would be different. \n\nYour friend needs to start accepting the fact that not only her pregnancy but things \n once baby arrives, means big life changes.", "If the whole point of the trip was to party, and your friend always knew that, and now she can\u2019t party due to circumstances that were fully in her control, then logically it\u2019s better to just cancel the trip. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t spend time together; it just means there\u2019s no longer an ROI for you on the time & money it would cost to go on this trip. Also, what if she experiences medical complications with the pregnancy? She\u2019s probably just processing the emotional stress of realizing that having a kid means there are things you can\u2019t do anymore. \n\nEdit- based on your response comment, you had planned to go zip lining. Your friend would be *legitimately insane* for wanting to do that while 6 months pregnant, and no zip line place would even let her anyway. \n\nSeems like the Reddit Temperance Society will come out in full force on this one, but haters gonna hate.

Why waste money going to this city if the entire dynamic has changed.", "You do not say exactly where you're going ( Cancun and Bali are on opposite sides of the world) but international travel requires vaccinations. Some of those vaccinations are not recommended or safe for pregnant women.\n\nAdditionally, international travel is not recommended in later pregnancy, and many countries have prohibitions against it because they do not want foreigners having their babies there, with all the paperwork and red tape it involves.\n\nIMO, it would be foolishness not to cancel while you can still get your money back, rather than waiting for the practical realities to smack your friend in the face sometime in January.", "NTA \n\nI'm with you in this, OP. In a reply you mentioned hiking to waterfalls at the crack of dawn .. at this point, neither of you know how her pregnancy will be then. How big she'll be, will she have morning sickness, will she be in pain, tired, uncomfortable. \n\nThe thing is, you planned a fun, adventure filled trip - which right now she cannot possibly commit to.\n\nEdit - OP also mentioned renting ATVs and ziplining as part of their plans. You just can't do that at 6 months pregnant.", "Well, a pregnant woman CAN party but there wouldn't be any alcohol involved on her part if she's responsible.

You had a vision for the trip that doesn't vibe with your friend's situation.

Could you make new plans that are doable with her being pregnant? Maybe a weekend somewhere more chill?", "Reserving judgement based on what city it is...  I mean, if it's New Orleans for Mardi Gras/Carnival, partying is probably the main reason you chose it.  If it's New York and you were also going to see musicals, museums, and some partying, that's different.", "NTA - I\u2019m a 5-6 month pregnant woman and would totally understand this. Maybe you can suggest that instead of the trip you guys can go out to a nicer restaurant in town and have a girls day but even if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re NTA.

Your friend needs to realize that life is about to change big time.", "I can see both sides of this, it's not like she will be going out afterward for quite a while. She'll be stuck at home with the new baby. \n\nBut it's better to get your money back now while you can, if she is moderately far along it def won't be the same. Maybe y'all can plan something lower key instead closer to the time to substitute based on what she feels up to then. \n\nNTA, it's just kinda a lose lose situation, and she is probably feeling a bit more sensitive than usual given pregnancy hormones etc.", "NTA, if you don't cancel the trip now, she could cancel the trip the week before because she's not feeling well.  I barged several times a day for 7 months,it happens. \n\nCancel the trip, but if you still want, reserve the weekend to do something more appropriate.", "NTA Yes you are bailing on her because the situation has changed.

It's s uch a good time to travel, the 6 mo. point, but yes, partying, ziplining, etc.. are not indicated. I went to Rome & Venice at that point in my pregnancy and all I missed was being able to drink. \n\nNTA, by the way. Just think there may be a solution working for both of you, but I agree you should cancel that planned trip.", "NTA\n\nIf you wanted to make a party vacation, then I would cancel. It's not like a spa hotel that you can still do being 6-7 months pregnant.", "NTA\n\nPregnancy can be rough as heck. Hormones and sickness and she will have no idea how she will be feeling in a few months. Even if it was a trip to go to museums or walk around a city it would still change a lot that shes pregnant.

Save that city for another time. If you\u2019re not willing to, then you are bailing on her because she\u2019s pregnant. It all depends on how good of friends you really are.

At six months if my friends wanted to go to a club, I would have, but it's not like I could really get down like I would normally.

I never understood this culture of \u201cgetting drunk and partying\u201d. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have friends who only want to do that. It seems like everyone here just doesn\u2019t like pregnant people. Which is weird.", "You\u2019re missing the point.\n\nIf OP wants to get shitfaced, ride ATVs, zip line, she\u2019s NTA for canceling the trip with her pregnant friend."]}
