The purpose of the trip was always drinking and maybe other stuff (no judgement) pregnant people cant/shouldnt do. This does not mean OP cares less for her friend, just that the plan needs to change.\n\nIf were planning on going on a trip to, lets say, ireland for saint patrick almost a year before, and the friends acompanying me where like \"oh  im pregnant now, but there are pretty churches and sightseeing we can see\" id also cancel the trip, as this was not what i signed up for. Nothing against the friend, or ireland, or churches or sightseeing... It was just not the plan.", "I\u2019m going to be downvoted but NTA. \n\nYou have no idea what her pregnancy will be like 3-4 months from now.  Will she be sick? Angry? Tired? Better to cancel now instead of pushing through when you won\u2019t have fun.\n\nI\u2019m with you on this.  Her being pregnant totally changes the trip.  You will definitely have to make some accommodations for her.  I think it\u2019s fair to cancel.", "NTA - when planning the trip you two were of same mind in terms of what the trip entailed.  Now with current/future circumstances you will not be wanting to do same activities as each other on the trip.", "INFO: What is she planning on doing now? If the point was to party and now she can't party, why is she still wanting to go?", "NTA - I get it.  You are literally planning a party trip, and now she can't party.  I say better you cancel and deal with the bad feelings now, as opposed to put money into the trip only for it to suck once you get there.  Y'all can still hang out and do things locally, and revisit the trip once her baby is old enough for her to leave with dad for a few days.", "NTA. \n\nHer pregnancy is changing the whole vibe of the trip you had planned.  You originally planned on cutting loose and partying.  If this hadn't been the plan from the start and it was more of a low-key hanging out affair, it would be different. \n\nYour friend needs to start accepting the fact that not only her pregnancy but things \n once baby arrives, means big life changes.", "If the whole point of the trip was to party, and your friend always knew that, and now she can\u2019t party due to circumstances that were fully in her control, then logically it\u2019s better to just cancel the trip. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t spend time together; it just means there\u2019s no longer an ROI for you on the time & money it would cost to go on this trip. Also, what if she experiences medical complications with the pregnancy while you\u2019re both away? She\u2019s probably just processing the emotional stress of realizing that having a kid means there are things you can\u2019t do anymore. \n\nEdit- based on your response comment, you had planned to go zip lining. Your friend would be *legitimately insane* for wanting to do that while 6 months pregnant, and no zip line place would even let her anyway. \n\nSeems like the Reddit Temperance Society will come out in full force on this one, but haters gonna hate.

Why waste money going to this city if the entire dynamic has changed.", "You do not say exactly where you're going ( Cancun and Bali are on opposite sides of the world) but international travel requires vaccinations. Some of those vaccinations are not recommended or safe for pregnant women.\n\nAdditionally, international travel is not recommended in later pregnancy, and many countries have prohibitions against it because they do not want foreigners having their babies there, with all the paperwork and red tape it involves.\n\nIMO, it would be foolishness not to cancel while you can still get your money back, rather than waiting for the practical realities to smack your friend in the face sometime in January.", "NTA \n\nI'm with you in this, OP. In a reply you mentioned hiking to waterfalls at the crack of dawn .. at this point, neither of you know how her pregnancy will be then. How big she'll be, will she have morning sickness, will she be in pain, tired, uncomfortable. \n\nThe thing is, you planned a fun, adventure filled trip - which right now she cannot possibly commit to.\n\nEdit - OP also mentioned renting ATVs and ziplining as part of their plans. You just can't do that at 6 months pregnant.", "Well, a pregnant woman CAN party but there wouldn't be any alcohol involved on her part if she's responsible.

You had a vision for the trip that doesn't vibe with your friend's situation.

Could you make new plans that are doable with her being pregnant? Maybe a weekend somewhere more chill?", "Reserving judgement based on what city it is...  I mean, if it's New Orleans for Mardi Gras/Carnival, partying is probably the main reason you chose it.  If it's New York and you were also going to see musicals, museums, and some partying, that's different.", "NTA - I\u2019m a 5-6 month pregnant woman and would totally understand this. Maybe you can suggest that instead of the trip you guys can go out to a nicer restaurant in town and have a girls day but even if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re NTA.

She'll be stuck at home with the new baby. \n\nBut it's better to get your money back now while you can, if she is moderately far along it def won't be the same. Maybe y'all can plan something lower key instead closer to the time to substitute based on what she feels up to then. \n\nNTA, it's just kinda a lose lose situation, and she is probably feeling a bit more sensitive than usual given pregnancy hormones etc.", "NTA, if you don't cancel the trip now, she could cancel the trip the week before because she's not feeling well.  I barged several times a day for 7 months,it happens. \n\nCancel the trip, but if you still want, reserve the weekend to do something more appropriate.", "NTA Yes you are bailing on her because the situation has changed.

It's s uch a good time to travel, the 6 mo. point, but yes, partying, ziplining, etc.. are not indicated. I went to Rome & Venice at that point in my pregnancy and all I missed was being able to drink. \n\nNTA, by the way. Just think there may be a solution working for both of you, but I agree you should cancel that planned trip.", "NTA\n\nIf you wanted to make a party vacation, then I would cancel. It's not like a spa hotel that you can still do being 6-7 months pregnant.", "NTA\n\nPregnancy can be rough as heck. Hormones and sickness and she will have no idea how she will be feeling in a few months. Even if it was a trip to go to museums or walk around a city it would still change a lot that shes pregnant.

We took my step daughter to the zoo and the smell of the monkey enclosure made me puke, I narrowly avoided puking on her head.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a scenario where a trip that was planned around drinking and partying will be enjoyable for a pregnant woman or her friends.\n\nNTA.", "Why not make plans to do a different trip more suitable for a pregnant woman? I mean, she\u2019s not going to be able to go on a party trip anytime soon anyway.", "I'm baffled by all the responses here.\n\nPerhaps I'm affected by my experience in spending time at a tropical all-inclusive resort with a terminally ill relative. My home country was in its coldest month at the time, and my relative just wanted a few weeks to feel a little bit carefree and not deal with the hassles of winter.  He and his family members made contingency plans for emergency health care, if needed (fortunately it wasn't), and off we went.  He and one other family member stayed there for three weeks; the rest of us joined them for shorter periods of time.\n\nHe didn't feel well every day.  There were days when he slept a lot, either in his room or on a lounge chair by the pool. There were times when he was nauseous. There were nights when he didn't sleep well.  But he was happier there than he would have been at home.\n\nWe didn't partake in the more vigorous pursuits that the venue had to offer, but we enjoyed the fresh air, the beautiful flowers, spending time on the beach (we escorted him in and out of the water so he wouldn't fall) or at the poolside, reading books side by side, or chatting when he had the energy for it.  It was nice.  Being together was nice.\n\nIf we could find a way to be happy spending time with a dying person (he passed away two months later), I don't understand why you feel you can't tolerate a vacation with a pregnant person.  I really don't.\n\nIt seems like you place a higher priority on the experiences you will have rather than person you plan to spend time with.  Which is fine, I suppose, but then you shouldn't feel surprised by the natural consequence of this, which is her feeling devalued and bailed on.\n\nConsider also that, even if she were to agree to a change in plans, things may or may not go well. She could be just as sick and tired at more low key location as at the original location you planned.\n\nAll vacations carry a risk that things will not go at planned.  The best way of mitigating that risk is to change your attitude and adjust your expectations.", "NAH \n\nYou\u2019re being very realistic. She\u2019s not going to be able to truly enjoy the trip, she just hasn\u2019t come to that realization yet. She will. I understand her wanting to still do the trip so she\u2019s not a bad guy either.

I see a whole of people who had a rough time while time pregnant on vacation. But, there are a lot of things to factor into that.\n\nWith my first (I was in my mid 20s), I had very little trouble early on. Actually went on several long weekends for lake swimming/camping in tents. \n\n\n Morning sickness didn't hit about 4 months in, it was ugly for about 4 weeks. While it got better, it didn't completely go away, either. But, it didn't keep me from doing any of things I enjoyed doing. \n\nAt 6 months I went on vacation with a group of friends. One week, warm beach 6 hr drive from home. While I did take a couple naps during that vacation, we still had plenty fun. While I was the sober one, but that was not new, and we still took turns despite my not drinking. There was plenty of partying, shopping, eating, goofing around.\n\nI think, depending on where your friend is in her pregnancy and how she feels, you might want to talk with her more about what your  expectations REALLY are for this trip. It sounds like you're more concerned that she won't be drinking and you're not comfortable with being the only one that is. Nothing wrong with that, but you need to honest about whatever your expectations are, so she knows why you want to wait so much on the vacation.", "NTA, cancel the trip. But also just wave the friendship good bye.

Get a hotel room and do some of the things you used to do.", "Cancel the original trip and maybe make alternative plans that factor in that she is pregnant and can be arranged at much shorter notice.\n\nBoth times I have been pregnant have been very different, but I would not want to plan for for a week of going out and partying for a whole week 4 months from now if I was pregnant.\n\nShe might well be up for it it now, she might well be up for it in February, but there no way she will actually know in advance.\n\nShe might be throwing up in a bucket, or needing to sleep 3 times a day.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for wanting to cancel because it\u2019s not the trip you had in mind. That would be rough for anyone, and you don\u2019t want to be disappointed in spending money. \n\nBut I also don\u2019t think your friend is the ass or wrong for still wanting to go. She\u2019s pregnant, not dead, so I think it makes sense that she\u2019d still want to do something before the baby comes. \n\nUltimately, what you both want from this weekend is different. That\u2019s fine, and these things happen.", "NAH. I get that she would feel upset. Being pregnant can easily make you feel left out when it comes to friends, because you can\u2019t do as much and you\u2019re not in the same life spot so you start becoming excluded. And you don\u2019t want to put fun stuff on hold just because you\u2019re pregnant, pregnancy is a long time and it can be lonely. She probably wants to keep living life like she was as much as possible before she has a baby too even if she just tags along without drinking, could also be because she doesn\u2019t want to become the friend that no one wants to do anything with anymore. It probably hurts her feelings so she\u2019s not thinking logically.\n\n\nBut it also makes a lot of sense for you to cancel. It won\u2019t be much fun for you if you have to hold back on everything you wanted to do. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend much money on a trip like that. If she\u2019s your best friend I might still go on a trip but make it somewhere like the beach where you\u2019d be relaxing anyways. Logically it would be best to cancel it especially if you don\u2019t get to go on trips often, but it may hurt the friendship. I would explain to her that it\u2019s just because of the TYPE of trip planned, not that you don\u2019t want a trip with her because she\u2019s pregnant.", "Yta. At least the way your describing it. It sounds like you care more about partying than seeing your friend. There are plenty of things you can do while pregnant other than getting smashed. She\u2019s pregnant not incapacitated. She\u2019s probably thinking that you don\u2019t value your friendship since you don\u2019t want to do this trip while she\u2019s pregnant, only when she\u2019s able to party hard. Also, it\u2019s not going to be easier for her to have a girls weekend when the baby comes - figuring out sleep, feeding, and general first year stuff.", "I mean a fun trip while you\u2019re pregnant is to do a \u201cmommy moon\u201d where you get kind of one last chance to just be you with a friend and not have to worry about a kid.

That way she knows that you still care about her and want to spend time with her.", "YTA. Girls trips may include partying but at the core it\u2019s a chance to spend time with your friend.

Just because she is pregnant does not mean you can't have a great time.  So she can't drink, but that is not the only thing to having a good time.

She\u2019ll be on her second trimester then, which is commonly called the golden period of pregnancy: no longer nauseous and not yet too exhausted. And she has to sit at home because her friend wants her to behave exactly how she had in mind planning the trip. It\u2019s controlling and unkind and just being a bad friend. Would you cancel a trip if your friend had suddenly decided to stop drinking alcohol for other health reasons? Be a vegan? Not like dancing as much as she did before?

For what it's worth, she's not an a-hole either for being pregnant. But you agreed to go on the trip with her under the premise of being able to indulge in certain activities; her circumstances have changed that, and you are not a jerk to have thoughts/feelings about that. It's your trip too. Btw, at 5-6 months pregnant, she may not realize this, but she is absolutely not going to feel like going out at night with you and being the only sober one. She's going to hate being on her feet as much as ya'll were probably planning to be, and she most definitely isn't going to feel like doing heavy physical activities.

Had a friend on bedrest five months in!\n\nYour other comments indicate hiking, ATV rides, even zip lining in addition to partying and drinking til 2AM. This will just not be a fun trip for her stuck being sober and trying to keep up. And probably a more miserable trip for the rest of you trying to tone it down to involve her.\n\nCanceling now is just logical.

If it weren't for the growing belly, I would have thought I went back to my original state.", "Worse than that, she would be limited by what her friend could do.", "That makes the assumption OP just has time and money to do a trip that isn\u2019t top priority for her.", "Oh yeah.  A ton of activity places wouldn't even want to come close to getting a lawsuit because that activity somehow messed the baby up during pregnancy.", "Your mum may have done it, but if she had asked her doctor about it, her doctor would have told her not to.", "I worked until 39+4 with my oldest, and until 36ish with this pregnancy. But the events that they have planned to do aren\u2019t pregnancy compatible. Partying, while sure you can attend pregnant, isn\u2019t really something fun to do at 5-6 months on when you can\u2019t really participate. I did enjoy going with my husband and friends to the bars twice my last pregnancy, and we may have a date night next week to go as a last event before the baby. But it does suck to go on vacation and have these plans and then not be able to do them. You can\u2019t go on most rides at amusement parks, so those are out. Can\u2019t guess how her body will handle pregnancy, so a lot of walking events and activities MAY be out, though not a certain thing, I still walk 3 miles regularly at almost 38 weeks. \n\nIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s a hard and fast \u201ceveryone will hate it\u201d but when you\u2019re 1/2 of a trip and you can\u2019t participate in a large part of what the plan of the trip was (partying), it\u2019s best to cancel or reschedule.", "Just a suggestion to alleviate her friend from feeling abandoned. Length of time was not a set in stone deal but to do something with her friend. Chill out man.", "I didn't realize how many restrictions there now were. It seems like you have protection from falling in most of them, and it takes significant impact to cause placental abruption/other issues in a low risk pregnancy, but I suppose it's a lot more expensive to cover pregnant women than it is to leave them off. \n\nI honestly wouldn't have found a week of clubbing all that fun at 6-7 months, though, but it depends on your personality. I didn't think it was best to be out so late, so I would have preferred a daytime fun vacation. Also, not many visibly pregnant women in clubs, generally, and I suspect it would open every discussion, making it easier to talk to people but harder to have a conversation you want to have.", "I went to the club and danced with friends a few times. I'm not a fan of clubbing but they invited me so I wore a nice dress and I went, danced, and had fun!", "If they stop being friends because of this, that friendship was on its deathbed anyway.", "OP likely means that people's lives change drastically when they have a kid. You can't just leave your kid for a week for a while at first. A lot of new parents don't want to either. It's really hard to leave a toddler for that period of time. The 2-3 years down the road would likely be because that is how long it would take friend to be able/want to get away.", "Well, not \u201cfirst hand\u201d. Second hand via your wife\u2019s own lived experiences.", "So, what I said?", "She said her friend would be around 6months pregnant so she'd be towards the end of second or beginning of third trimester I'm guessing. I was still hiking/camping etc up until the end. I went on a cave tour and climbed over a hundred flights of steps and crawled through wet rock tunnels a week before my baby was born so I'm always erring on the side of \"go for it\"", "A memory of her friend stuck on the \"sidelines\" unable to participate in most of what OP wants to do? Or OP resigned to doing things they could have done cheaper and easier back home. Going to a \"party city\" and not being able to party sucks.\n\nNo zip-line company worth their salt is going to allow a six month pregnant woman on their attraction. Their insurance would be yanked as soon as the company providing it gets wind of it. And without that insurance, they can't operate. And no, waivers wouldn't cover this.\n\nNeither would an ATV rental place.", "I mean look at what Halloween and christmas have become both of those started out as religious holidays but plenty of people celebrate both without celebrating/participating in the religious side", "That's a specific condition that isn't common. Not every pregnancy involves hyperemisis gravidarium", "I mean most pregnant people don\u2019t need a sitter unless something is seriously wrong lol", "Yeah that really is the best plan. I'm sorry you have to cancel, and I am sorry for your friend who may not like it now but who will agree with you in a few months.", "OP has said if they cancel soon, they wouldn\u2019t lose any money on their originally planned trip.\n\nI only offered a different suggestion so that they can still get their time together, even if it\u2019s not what is originally planned. OP is free to take it, or leave it, but I personally would try to accommodate my friend, whether our new plans were my \u201ctop priority\u201d or not.", "Oh why waste money in her friend. Yeah how beautiful friend she is", "I don\u2019t think people realize how much a spa week or even a spa weekend cost.", "Yep.  They don't want to come within a mile of a lawsuit like that.", "They're cancling. OP can do that whenever they want. This was a group trip. No point in rescheduling it as something else even if it's shorter or.less expensive.", "Sipping on mocktails is fine until you get diagnosed with gestational diabetes hahaha.", "Nope, ATVs are out. Also outside of 1st trimester, which OPs friend won't be, throwing up, especially frequently, is uncommon. Seriously if that's really how pregnancy worked do you think we'd all be working throughout pregnancy as a norm?", "Except when you go on holiday with 1 other person, the intent is to spend majority of the time with them. Some people would be put out if they are left alone frequently.", "Vacations can cost 1000's of dollars, not to mention limit PTO.  None of my friends would expect me to spend that much money on them.", "What\u2019s this nonsense? America?", "Why should she have to change what she wants to do and what the friend had agreed to before she got pregnant. Sure, they can do that. But not as an alternative to the fun action packed trip they had planned. She doesn\u2019t want to, how about that\ud83d\ude44", "OP should not change her plans just because her friend decided to get creampied\u2026 the world does not revolve around pregnant women\u2026 she chose to get pregnant, and should also know that her friends will start doing stuffs that doesn\u2019t go around her pregnant self", "As a pregnant woman, she was probably more scared the placenta would detach as that's the actual danger with bumpy rides and why we can't ride amusement park rides.", "Hahaha!  Not even mocktails are safe.  Pregnancy can be ROUGH!  Shout out to all you warriors out there.", "Dude, most women have less nausea after the 1st trimester but it isn\u2019t \u201crare.\u201d  I mean 3% of pregnant people have hyperemesis gravidarum.  I wouldn\u2019t even call that rare. But many more have nausea after the 1st trimester", "Not sure what that has to do with my comment", "Yeah because vacations are all about drinking to oblivion. There's no other activities, beaches, swing pools, walks, bars, or any other plan they can do. \n\nThis one just touches too close home.\n\nI went to a concert with my ex SIL back in 2005 when her two best friends bailed on her because they didn't want to go a concert with her pregnant friend for imagined reasons they just concocted. She had a tremendous good pregnancy barr her nasty friends \n\nMy ex SIL was the only one with a car and she was free riding everybody to everywhere every summer. And then... \n\nThey totally abandoned her for the whole pregnancy because \"oh you can't do this, you can't do that\". They were worse than her obgyn. A pair of 20 something demons. It started with a concert and it ended with coffees or walks or fucking county fairs. She was absolutely  heartbroken. She didn't need a babysitter as someone nastily has written in another comment,just her friends\n\nI'm pregnant now so I'm glad I have far better friends than those.", "3% is incredibly rare. Vomiting (not nausea, which wasn't being discussed here) in the mid to late 2nd trimester is uncommon.", "OP didn't mention just the drinking, but way to cherry pick. How about the ATV and zip lining?", "3% is one out of 33 pregnant people who have HG.\n\nRare is 1 in a ten thousand or 1 in a million.\n\nMany more continue to be sick into their 2nd and 3rd trimesters", "Honestly. Hell, my first pregnancy I had Hyperemesis Gravardium and was puking through month 7. I lost over 20 lbs before gaining an once. Toast made me nauseated. It was a horrible experience all around.", "I hope the pregnant friend ends doing the plan with another person, her bf or something and just tag op all over Instagram.\n\nIt's disgusting how some people is saying \"oh she's pregnant she's already changed\" but they are the ones forcing her to stay home because she's pregnant and she's not fun anymore."]}
