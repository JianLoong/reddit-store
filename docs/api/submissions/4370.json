Honestly it doesn't seem like it should be that much to ask.\n\nEdit 2: Just so everyone is aware I know that this is my problem and it's up to me to control myself. Of course I know that.

It is a matter of YOU learning restraint and willpower as relying on anyone else in this sort of situation can and will lead to your downfall if you alone don't have the desire to get better. \n\nI would suggest sitting her down and explaining how you don't mind if she has a different diet to you, or even if she eats the foods you struggle most with binging on. But ask if she could either find replacement, FOR NOW, or store them a little more discretely so you are not tempted. \n\nIf she's hiding her food in her socks drawer and you find them and eat them, that is 100% not her fault. \n\nI really hope you guys find a good compromise and wish you good luck on your journey to better health. \n\nNAH", "As I approach my third soberversary, I realize that my husband\u2019s willingness not to have alcohol in the house or alcohol around me has helped me so so much.

Like if we all went out and had a cigarette one night, I brushed it off and just said I would do better the next day. My friends somehow were back to smoking the next day. This pattern is pretty common with diets, too: you mess it up once and just start eating like crap because you messed it up.

He would go take the alcohol to a friend's place for safe keeping. When we went out to parties I would choose not to drink and he would always ask if it was okay if he did. I never cared if he enjoyed alcohol while we were out, but how it made me feel that he was considerate enough to ask makes me feel valued to this day. I didn't want my husband to miss out on fun experiences just because I had a problem, so he went to plenty of parties/bar nights without me, and we both accepted there are just some things we will not be able to enjoy together.\n\n As the years went on and the desire for alcohol became less powerful, we were able to take less drastic steps.

This woman does not love you. People have the ability to exert will power in two different places. Some can exert will power at home but most of us do it at the grocery store. The only way I can manage to not eat junk food is by not buying it! If it\u2019s in my house I have to eat it so I just don\u2019t buy it. You are at the edge of dying from your food consumption and I think extreme situations require extreme responses. Move out, even if it\u2019s just for a few months, as you need to control your  living in environment in order to control your eating.  Get rid of high sugar, high carb, highly processed foods to start with. You can do this and sometimes being alone let\u2019s us figure out and pick our best direction even if it\u2019s lonely and scary while we do it.

Maybe she doesn\u2019t even realize she\u2019s doing that, but I gotta tell ya if my boyfriend told me he needed me to support his health by not keeping a small list of specific foods in the house I would do it no questions asked. Because he always always sacrifices ordering the foods he loves when he knows they make me sick. He just eats those things when I\u2019m not there. Your wife has a motive here and it would do you both good to figure out why she doesn\u2019t want to support your health and wellness needs", "Not gonna vote on the asshole part. Just going to share my experience. I was over 400 lbs and started breaking my feet due to weight. Went through 2 separate medical weight loss programs, asked the family for help. Mind you, the family was asking me to lose weight so I was around. Asked for help not to have sugar in the house. They did that. I needed help then not going out to get sugar. I asked my spouse, if we talk about it, could you please just say no?  If I heard a no, i would drop the idea. Sugar/food addiction is real. 2 days after this request my spouse came home and said \u201clet\u2019s go get ice cream\u201d. We did and that ended my medical weight loss program. Within a year we divorced, i found a great therapist and i did gastric bypass. That is NOT an easy fix. It is a tool to use. With therapy, the surgery, a nutritionist, and a lot of tears and reflection, I have lost 200 lbs. My ex and I are great friends and I get the support I need. We realized we can\u2019t live together. We co-sabotage one another. We actually are in therapy together working on it as we have kids. It was a drastic step, but everyone agrees it was one that had to happen.", "NTA at all in my opinion.\n\nMight get flack for this, but I'm currently trying to overcome alcoholism and my fiance, guess what? shares my drink of choice. we've had multiple conversations about how he would like to be able to have alcohol in the house, but he doesn't fucking buy it because he knows im struggling. Probably will for a very long time, I got very dependant on drinking pretty much all day every day.\n\nAsking your wife to not stock certain snacks is just common courtesy on her part.

I'm just curious if that was an option that you've discussed with your doctors to aid in your weight loss. While I understand that certain foods can be triggers you have to learn to control yourself. Self discipline goes a long way. Hopefully your wife becomes a little more understanding of the situation but it sounds like you're not really doing enough To help yourself. You need to find some type of exercise that you can do. Possibly something aquatic as the water will add bouancy and make it easier to move without stressing your body so much. I really do wish you well and hope everything works out for both of you.", "NTA. Your wife is being unsupportive.

My enjoyment of alcohol is less important to me than my loved one's health. \n\nHave you thought of seeing a therapist and going to couple's counceling? Their job is to give you tools to help you deal with situations when you are confronted by these foods and to help you both to deal with this as a team.\n\nIn the mean time, ask your doctor about ozempic and the like.

In less serious circumstances I might agree with the previous poster, but OP is facing serious, potentially fatal health issues. \n\nIs it ultimately OP\u2019s responsibility to control his food struggles? Absolutely, but he\u2019s clearly struggling with addiction and is asking his partner for support. That\u2019s what a partnership is about. It\u2019s not always going to be plain sailing.

Yes, I've seen my stepdad do this. My mom keeps all of the food locked, the pantry is locked and he breaks into them at least once a week. If my mom buys herself a snack, he'll eat it before the groceries are even unpacked. She has to keep food for herself at her sister's house or she won't eat. Sometimes he eats the whole dinner she cooked before she can fix herself a plate. \n\nIt's hard living with a person like this. I empathize, but you have to at least have some self control. Because if I hide myself a snack and you go through my personal belongings to find it and eat it, I'm going to be incredibly mad. And if it happens enough times, I'm probably going to be sick of you and hope for your demise. I've been watching my mom go through this for a decade and I'm pretty sure the pandemic made her reach her patience limit.

This persons wife is probably struggling herself because NO MATTER WHAT she brings home, it\u2019s a trigger. \n\nI can imagine that it\u2019s been a new trigger once she\u2019s found a new safe food for herself. \n\nOP needs an inpatient stay somewhere to deal with this issue of making someone else responsible for his choices.", "She should leave him", "Not a rant.
