It is a matter of YOU learning restraint and willpower as relying on anyone else in this sort of situation can and will lead to your downfall if you alone don't have the desire to get better. \n\nI would suggest sitting her down and explaining how you don't mind if she has a different diet to you, or even if she eats the foods you struggle most with binging on. But ask if she could either find replacement, FOR NOW, or store them a little more discretely so you are not tempted. \n\nIf she's hiding her food in her socks drawer and you find them and eat them, that is 100% not her fault. \n\nI really hope you guys find a good compromise and wish you good luck on your journey to better health. \n\nNAH", "As I approach my third soberversary, I realize that my husband\u2019s willingness not to have alcohol in the house or alcohol around me has helped me so so much.

But yeah If you ever need advice or anything feel free to hmu.", "I highly recommend that you read Rethinking Thin by Gina Kolata. \n\nBigotry against overweight people runs so deep that you won\u2019t change people\u2019s minds, but at least you\u2019ll have factual information that weight is genetic.", "A lot of people have suggested that. We would need to get her something that's actually a safe because I was a tradesman I have power tools that can make short work of anything other than a proper safe.", "I can't sit in chairs because of my back but I appreciate the thought.", "This 100%\n\nI am reminded of one of my favorite movie quotes (from Ladyhawke), \"I know that you know what a weak willed person I am.\"\n\nKeeping the trigger foods out of the house would be the easiest way to support her husband.", "Congrats on the weight loss. It's super hard to do.", "It is only a few flavors of stuff and I am early in this weight loss journey. It's nice to talk to somebody who's been through the exact experience I'm having right now.", "Believe me the thought has crossed my mind.", "I'm trying to control my environment.", "I do know about the constructive value of cheats but I would rather die than give up my coffee. Lol", "Lol", "Thanks.", "Wow. I bet you're feeling great. I can't even imagine myself getting down to an ideal weight. When I was 19 I had a labor job, I worked out with weights, and I would cycle a lot. I tried intermittent fasting and I only ate between a I think it was a five or six hour window. First meal was at lunch, second was at dinner and then nothing again till the next day at lunch. I never even got close to my ideal weight before my body revolted. I couldn't work out anymore I could barely cycle and then my muscles just kind of stopped wanting to work at work. I Had to start eating more to continue exercising and working. I never even got close to a low enough body fat to see abs and I think I was still a good 10 lb over my ideal target weight according to the doctors. I kind of feel like I'm just built to be fat to one degree or another.", "I'll have a look for it thanks.", "Therapy is not a solve all soultion, and people should deserve sympathy and help even if they don't go to one.", "You can \"not eat\" for quite a long time. One morbidly obese man went a whole year consuming nothing but water and vitamins. Not saying you should, just that it is physically possible. \n\nYour wife is presumably overweight too? Maybe suggest you both go keto so you can support each other. Make sure to quit seed oils at the same time.", "This may sound really stupid, but have you tried to see if maybe there is an overeaters anonymous around you? Also NTA", "As someone who is actually a candidate for the sleeve: you're required to have a specific BMI before they perform the surgery", "Yeah. The small amount of type 2 that aren\u2019t from diet are super hard to treat. \n\nThat is not OP", ">a surgeon has agreed to surgically work on his back\n\nNope. I don't even have a surgeon yet. I've been told I have an appointment for a consultation with one in the spring.", "Thanks.", ">I don't even think a lock box is going to help at all.\n\nYou're the first person to say that about lock boxes can you tell me why you think that?", "I feel that completely coffee is a must for sure", "Lol. Okay bro.", "Yeah that\u2019s how I felt. And yeah according to doctors I am still overweight for my height. Honestly I just wanna be a weight I\u2019m comfortable at. But the whole food triggering thing is gonna be super hard. Also about your mobility don\u2019t try to do all that at once start off at like 10 to 15 minutes a day and slowly build your stamina back up. If you have the space do house walking", "What do those acronyms stand for? People have been using them and I have no idea what they're talking about.", "I've mentioned in a few places that people don't know what they don't know. It's disappointing however that in that situation, in a state of ignorance, that people default to being mean-spirited. Must be human nature in 2022.", "I can't do that unfortunately. There are some life-saving medications I take that require food or else I'll develop ulcers. I know about the man you're talking about and that's a very interesting story.", "No I haven't looking to a 12-step program.", "My daughter's friends mother who leads their scout troop got it and she had to lose 50.", "Yeah we talked about it and she didn't really open up but there was definitely some kind of uncomfortableness with me losing weight or changing or something.", "Because her food is hidden everywhere. She won't use it.", "Well like I said in my top post I have a serious back injury. I'm going into a rehab program in the early New Year hopefully. It has a high likelihood of helping me to get moving because physio has been a nightmare and I haven't even yet had a consult with a surgeon to tell me if it's possible to fix me that way.", "I was going with Y T A. but then I realized y'all were married. In sickness and in health is what you both promised. She can eat junk at her desk. You begging it not be in the home will not kill her (may even help her tbh!!) Alcoholic spouses would get that kind if help. It's complicated for me to speak objectively became I have ADHD, food allergies that worsen my symptoms ten fold+ and addictions and I WANT to believe that if I had the will power to tell my spouse \"hey can we not have thses things in the house\" they would agree... but at the same time... I know that with a baby who needs a well balanced diet and a healthy spouse, it would be completely impossible to get rid of ALLL my allergies even if it triggers me. Balance is needed and frank conversation. There will not be a perfect solution unfortunately.

I don't know where you live but where I live there's no diagnosis ceremony where somebody presents you with an engraved plaque of your diagnosis. Doctors don't always even tell you you're diagnosis here. They just treat you. What is you deal with this like how does this work where you live? What exactly are you looking for in my answer?", "Cool thank you", "Yeah I brought it up with a couple of doctors before and they were very excited but keep hearing about it's effectiveness on diabetes that maybe I should bring it up again. Oh I remember what my psychiatrist said. He said it's hard to stick to I'm having a hard time right now so maybe it's something that'll work better in the future. It took me a second to recall that. I do want to try it at some point though.", "I got you covered.", "Thanks", "The doctor telling you you have a disease or condition _is the formal diagnosis._ The information goes in your medical history, whether at the hospital or if your country has some centralized database for health insurance purposes. It is used to get you the treatment you need. \n\nUsually when people say \u201cinformal diagnosis,\u201d the implication is that while you have symptoms consistent with a condition or disease, whatever testing they\u2019ve done has somehow ruled out the suspected culprit. Basically, the doctor doesn\u2019t feel confident stating that you definitely have that condition or disease.\n\nHonestly, the way that you came at me here is weirdly defensive. It is going to make people suspect whether the \u201ctreatment\u201d you\u2019ve been receiving is actually legitimate.", "It is a pain when going out, but if you completely ban yourself from carbs, it can be easier than trying to limit food in general, because then you have no excuse to eat even a little bit.\n\nI still think your wife is being very unreasonable and unsupportive.", "You have to be very strict and disciplined if you do keto. If you have even a few too many carbs to keep you from ketoacidosis all you have accomplished is eating high fat and often more calories than you would normally consume \n\nAs a nutritionist I would recommend speaking with a dietician if you decide to try a diet such as this because most people do it incorrectly and to be honest based on your post about having no self control around certain foods it really doesn\u2019t sound like the right diet for you", "Yeah, my bf (who is not overweight at all) can vary by over 3lb between just after taking a dump and eating a big meal....", "Nobody; it was blindingly obvious that he was talking to two different people.

That's why I'm not trying to do keto. I'd like to try it and maybe someday I'll be able to but it's definitely a future endeavor if it happens at all.", "I don't think you understood the second, longer paragraph because it described the hope I have that this change to my environment could be helpful to me if it could be accomplished."]}
