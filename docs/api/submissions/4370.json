It is a matter of YOU learning restraint and willpower as relying on anyone else in this sort of situation can and will lead to your downfall if you alone don't have the desire to get better. \n\nI would suggest sitting her down and explaining how you don't mind if she has a different diet to you, or even if she eats the foods you struggle most with binging on. But ask if she could either find replacement, FOR NOW, or store them a little more discretely so you are not tempted. \n\nIf she's hiding her food in her socks drawer and you find them and eat them, that is 100% not her fault. \n\nI really hope you guys find a good compromise and wish you good luck on your journey to better health. \n\nNAH", "As I approach my third soberversary, I realize that my husband\u2019s willingness not to have alcohol in the house or alcohol around me has helped me so so much.
