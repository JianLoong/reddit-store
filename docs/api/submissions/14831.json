My dad did this same shit every time he got remarried. Suddenly I was supposed to treat someone I hadn't met until I was in my 30s, like a new mom.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with keeping step parents at a distance and if your dad can't accept that, cut his ass out as well.

That\u2019s ridiculous that your dad is getting upset about it, especially as it\u2019s senior night FOR you and ofc you\u2019d want YOUR mother and YOUR father. Your mom would feel awful if she didn\u2019t get to walk out with you. The y^t^a is ridiculous and about as stupid as your dad making the whole celebration about him not you **edited you\u2019re oh so NTA. Congrats on band senior night -former marching band flute", "NTA. Your dad married this woman twoish years ago? She is not your mother. She did not raise you. Your parents, the people who birthed you, can walk you out. Do not let your dad guilt you into this. Shame on him for guilting you. Tell your dad \" I want my parents, you and mom, to walk out with me\" Repeat on a loop.", "NTA. It\u2019s your night, and your choice.

I never could understand parents who aren\u2019t willing to set aside all the BS and second marriages and everything else so their child could have a nice memory and photos of their nuclear family. It\u2019s not hard! It\u2019s a gift to your child!", "NTA.\n\nYour dad is wrong. The night is about you, not him! (This is coming from a mom who's going through all those senior-year events with my own kid this year.) Walking with you is an honor for the parents who raised you and parented you throughout your years of school. That honor belongs to your mom and your dad. Anyone else demanding that honor is ridiculous (and TA).\n\nIs your mom supportive of your decision? Could she help advocate for you? You deserve the right to make this choice without a selfish guilt trip from your dad.", "\u201cMy dad told me the night is more about the parents\u2026\u201d.

I hope you can both be there but I'll respect your decision if either of you decide not to be\".

Senior night is a big night for the student and the parents, but the focus is the student. Your step-mother has been your step-mother for a year or two. It\u2019s weird for your dad to even suggest this. The acknowledgment of the parents is a nod for supporting the student through their band journey.
