She didn\u2019t say it with any malice.  I know I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet, but I beat stage 4 cancer a little over a year ago now, and the hardest part was seeing how hard it was for the people around me.  It seemed harder for them than it did for me tbh.  It\u2019s a really bizarre experience.  I don\u2019t know what type of cancer you have, but all hope may not be lost!  I had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to my liver.  I did 6 months of chemo and 3 surgeries.  They told me I most likely wouldn\u2019t make it but I\u2019ve been cancer free for over a year!

If they were talking to your family members, then it is okay to sympathize with their perspective. Your in-laws were basically telling you how hard it is on the people around you, but not even recognizing what this is doing to you. \n\nTelling you it's not your fault is ridiculous when you've never voiced that you felt it was. \n\nI'm very sorry and hope a virtual hug from a stranger on Reddit helps you know that you aren't wrong for anything you feel. I hope you are working through your bucket list.", "NAH. I'm guessing that she would have felt guilty for \"leaving\" her family, and just didn't quite get the difference. People are really clueless in how to cope with illness and death and provide comfort to others. Sorry you're having to deal with all this.", "NTA.  That\u2019s a pretty big assumption on their part, and quite insulting, if they think they need to remind you it\u2019s not your fault.  Then to say YOU were being rude?  When you were pointing out how ridiculous and patronizing that statement was with your response?  You are definitely NTA.", "NAH. \n\nSometimes, when people get sick like this, there's a tendency to blame themselves, even when it's illogical to do that. Kind of a reverse survivor's guilt, you know? Where sometimes people who survive a catastrophe feel guilty even though it makes no logical sense? \n\nI think what they might have been trying to express to you is that having those kinds of dark thoughts is ok, and that they're not the truth. It's probably also an expression of sorrow at the thought of losing you. You're their family too, and they're probably pretty beat up about it as well, and extremely sorry for what your wife and children are going through too. \n\nHonestly, it feels like a mark of respect that they would assume that your emotions are more centered on your family than on yourself, although obviously it's pretty natural to swing between those and facing your mortality is certainly as good a time as any to really center yourself. \n\nI'd probably apologize if it were me but also ask that maybe we keep conversations a bit more light in the future.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry for everything your processing right now, I hope you have access to counselling for yourself and your children and this is an impossible situation for you to wrap your head around I\u2019m sure.

Don\u2019t bother to apologize, instead focus on giving your children and wife your best while you can, and ignore anyone trying to shift focus onto their own petty, made up drama.", "NTA. I don't get why people say stuff like that. Let alone a second time after a blunt response to the first. It's just a given that it's not deserved. Saying that, some people genuinely are trying to be polite but still say the wrong things because they don't know what else to say. I personally wouldn't apologize, I don't think you did anything wrong. If they do it yet again, then they are just trying to piss you off or absolutely naive to the intricate feelings in the situation. \n\nThat being said, I hope you're surrounded by people that care and try to make things as easy as possible for you.", "NTAH, but I can see why she'd initially assume that you'd find that reassuring. I have severe (but not terminal) chronic illness and people frequently imply that it's my fault and that I could have prevented it by \"having a more positive attitude\" etc. Lots of healthy people like to imagine that their health is 100% a deserved reward for good behavior, so there are a lot of victim-blaming narratives out there, especially in religious/spiritual/self-help spaces. But she should've taken the hint the first few times she said it. And the fact that she thinks you need to prioritize being unrelentingly polite/taking care of her feelings even though you're the one who is dying, makes her the asshole in this situation imo.", "NTA I don't know what \"It's not your fault\" is supposed to mean either in this situation. Does she think you accidentally manifested cancer on yourself? I bet op is tired of hearing the same things over and over again from different people and it's quite presumptuous on her part to assume you feel blame for the situation.", "Sometimes people just talk a lot. They say words for  no reason. In this scenario, she just wants to say words to console you because she doesn\u2019t know what else to say. Honestly not saying anything would be the best for her.

The full article is worth the read. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/laugh-cry-live/201809/how-respond-people-in-crisis-comfort-in-dump-out\n\nI share this because this might be worth having your wife share the article with her family as a framework to help assess how they're feeling and whether what they say to you (or to her) is helpful or is \"stealing the spotlight\" (a concept in the article). \n\nI find this useful to understand that the insensitive person is possibly dealing with their own grief/stress, but they are directing their comments inward in the circles rather than out. The rule is \"comfort in, dump out\".   \n\n<Begin quote>\nHere\u2019s how it works: Imagine concentric circles. In the center ring is the person or people who are the most directly affected, aggrieved, and afflicted. In the next ring are close relatives; the next ring holds true friends; the ring after that holds acquaintances like neighbors, colleagues, distant relatives, and casual friends. The next circle holds caregivers who are professionally involved as sources of support or assistance, including doctors, nurses, therapists, and first responders, but the tragedy doesn\u2019t touch their personal lives. The outermost circles contain community members and bystanders. They may be interested in this family or the situation, but they don\u2019t have a direct personal or professional connection. This outermost ring can also include professionals like staff supervisors, hospital administrators, support staff, or any caregivers or responders who were not directly involved in caring for the family, plus journalists reporting the news and onlookers from the general public.\n\nNow, imagine a spotlight. Train it on the center ring, so it is most brightly lit, making it abundantly clear where the focus of caregiving should be. Now notice how the light is diffused across all the rings, which become more dimly lit as they span ever outward. To the people in rings brighter than yours, it is appropriate to sympathize, but not complain. If you want to complain or seek your own comfort, turn to the people in your ring or better yet, the people in rings that are more dimly lit. That\u2019s because they are naturally less directly afflicted by this crisis. The spotlight also demonstrates a key component of offering comfort: Never steal the spotlight!\n<End quote>", "\"Focus on your health and well being\"\n\nI am sorry and i understand if this may come across as slighlty insensitve but fuck that.\n\n If this is terminal and there is little to no possibility of a cure/remission then make what time you have left count.\n\nDo as much as possible with your kids.

I would like to pass along a few things that might help.\n\nLook to see if your state requires a will when a person only has one heir. My sister died unexpectedly and did not have a will. She only has one son. Thankfully in Texas all that is required is an Affidavit of Heirship. It is done by a lawyer and two people who knew my sister had to sign with a notary. I signed (obviously) and then we had another long term person sign. We are attesting that she did not have any other children. Then it is filed with the court and the judge signs off. Then you use that along with the death certificate to close things out. \n\nBanks- everyone should have a POD on their bank accounts. This is \u201cpayable on death.\u201d It means if you pass away, the POD has full access to your account. You will have to have the death certificate so the POD does not have access UNTIL that is issued. If you want to have access now, and including before the death certificate is issued, then you should be added now as a joint owner of the account. \n\nHolographic wills- check your state, but in Texas if you completely handwrite out your will and it is signed then it is a legal will. It cannot have anything on it that is not handwritten. When my sister died we realized if my nephew died his POD deadbeat dad was his next of kin and would be entitled to everything. So the attorney advised him to write a holographic will and send someone a copy. He wrote it all out and emailed a copy to me and kept the original. \n\nAnyone who has an iPhone should fill out a legacy form designating who their Apple account belongs to if they pass away. Otherwise, if you pass away all content in your Apple account reverts back to being owned by Apple. Also write down or give someone trusted the PIN to your phone.
