She didn\u2019t say it with any malice.  I know I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet, but I beat stage 4 cancer a little over a year ago now, and the hardest part was seeing how hard it was for the people around me.  It seemed harder for them than it did for me tbh.  It\u2019s a really bizarre experience.  I don\u2019t know what type of cancer you have, but all hope may not be lost!  I had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to my liver.  I did 6 months of chemo and 3 surgeries.  They told me I most likely wouldn\u2019t make it but I\u2019ve been cancer free for over a year!  Wishing you the best, stranger!", "NTA \n\nWhen someone is talking to you directly about your situation, they should be extra compassionate and have sympathy for YOU. If they were talking to your family members, then it is okay to sympathize with their perspective. Your in-laws were basically telling you how hard it is on the people around you, but not even recognizing what this is doing to you. \n\nTelling you it's not your fault is ridiculous when you've never voiced that you felt it was. \n\nI'm very sorry and hope a virtual hug from a stranger on Reddit helps you know that you aren't wrong for anything you feel. I hope you are working through your bucket list.", "NAH. I'm guessing that she would have felt guilty for \"leaving\" her family, and just didn't quite get the difference. People are really clueless in how to cope with illness and death and provide comfort to others. Sorry you're having to deal with all this.", "NTA.  That\u2019s a pretty big assumption on their part, and quite insulting, if they think they need to remind you it\u2019s not your fault.  Then to say YOU were being rude?  When you were pointing out how ridiculous and patronizing that statement was with your response?  You are definitely NTA.", "NAH. \n\nSometimes, when people get sick like this, there's a tendency to blame themselves, even when it's illogical to do that. Kind of a reverse survivor's guilt, you know? Where sometimes people who survive a catastrophe feel guilty even though it makes no logical sense? \n\nI think what they might have been trying to express to you is that having those kinds of dark thoughts is ok, and that they're not the truth. It's probably also an expression of sorrow at the thought of losing you. You're their family too, and they're probably pretty beat up about it as well, and extremely sorry for what your wife and children are going through too. \n\nHonestly, it feels like a mark of respect that they would assume that your emotions are more centered on your family than on yourself, although obviously it's pretty natural to swing between those and facing your mortality is certainly as good a time as any to really center yourself. \n\nI'd probably apologize if it were me but also ask that maybe we keep conversations a bit more light in the future.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry for everything your processing right now, I hope you have access to counselling for yourself and your children and this is an impossible situation for you to wrap your head around I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sure they expected you to share your suddenly acquired perspective/wisdom from your diagnosis, rather than simply allowing you to grieve and process what I\u2019m sure is an impossible and surreal situation. Don\u2019t bother to apologize, instead focus on giving your children and wife your best while you can, and ignore anyone trying to shift focus onto their own petty, made up drama.", "NTA. I don't get why people say stuff like that. Let alone a second time after a blunt response to the first. It's just a given that it's not deserved. Saying that, some people genuinely are trying to be polite but still say the wrong things because they don't know what else to say. I personally wouldn't apologize, I don't think you did anything wrong. If they do it yet again, then they are just trying to piss you off or absolutely naive to the intricate feelings in the situation. \n\nThat being said, I hope you're surrounded by people that care and try to make things as easy as possible for you.", "NTAH, but I can see why she'd initially assume that you'd find that reassuring. I have severe (but not terminal) chronic illness and people frequently imply that it's my fault and that I could have prevented it by \"having a more positive attitude\" etc. Lots of healthy people like to imagine that they their health is 100% a deserved reward for good behavior, so there are a lot of victim-blaming narratives out there, especially in religious/spiritual/self-help spaces. But she should've taken the hint the first few times she said it. And the fact that she thinks you need to prioritize being unrelentingly polite/taking care of her feelings even though you're the one who is dying, makes her the asshole in this situation imo.", "NTA I don't know what \"It's not your fault\" is supposed to mean either in this situation. Does she think you accidentally manifested cancer on yourself? I bet op is tired of hearing the same things over and over again from different people and it's quite presumptuous on her part to assume you feel blame for the situation.", "Sometimes people just talk a lot. They say words for  no reason. In this scenario, she just wants to say words to console you because she doesn\u2019t know what else to say. Honestly not saying anything would be the best for her.

I guess they probably meant to be showing empathy and understanding, but to say it more than once makes it seem as if they wanted a particular reaction from you. Did they want you to show guilt and blame yourself for something that obviously isn't your fault? Maybe so they could be the ones to reassure and sort of 'absolve' you? It kinda seems like it, which is pretty twisted. It should be completely up to you who you turn to for difficult conversations and it's clearly not going to be them and they should accept that.

But you come first. And if they don\u2019t like your reaction, it clearly means what they gave isn\u2019t helpful, and they need to figure out how to support you and your needs.

The scenario combined with your head space and how you must be feeling then misinterpretation is likely to happen.", "I\u2019m sorry you are going through this - both the cancer and other people struggling to communicate kindly with you. \n\nIt may be that your xIL is instinctively and selfishly focussing on this through the lens of the awful thing that is happening to their child. They probably feel terrible and powerless about the pain their daughter will be feeling and possibly empathise with your parents\u2019 position. Their may be some subconscious resentment that you have \u201cdone this\u201d to their daughter, guilt for those feelings, and know this is unfair and that you are not to blame for it. Then their mouth magically goes to \u201c...it\u2019s not your fault\u201d.", "NTA. It baffles me that so many people don't see how unhelpful statements like that can be and how presumptive they are. MIL feeling offended AND going around telling people you were rude was kinda low. You were NOT being overly sensitive. She was being insensitive initially and later on turned overly sensitive and made it about herself. Godspeed OP. Take care.", "NTA, but as someone who recently went through cancer treatment, I can recommend being proactive with telling people, especially those close to you, how you want to be treated. I didn\u2019t want pity, so I told people to cut that out and support me by listening, telling me stories and making jokes. It greatly diminished my frustration levels.", "NTA. Try not to get sucked into her need to have a touchy feeling moment backfiring on her, that\u2019s her main character syndrome talking. \n\nTime is precious. Spend it on the people who matter, not this do-gooder that isn\u2019t actually that good at doing good if she can\u2019t handle a minor critique at a thoughtless comment. She may not be aware that her comment \u201cheeeeeyyyy you may have never thought of this BUT it isn\u2019t your fault\u201d can plant the seed that \u201cwait, there\u2019s people who would think this IS my fault?\u201d It\u2019s a weird thing for her to say, however well intentioned.", "You are not an ass hole, you should demand an apology for the in laws telling people you were rude when they were incredibly rude to you to provoke you.", "NAH. It's a tough time and I'm sorry for all of you. Everyone should understand a few bad moments by you with this. But I think in-law was just projecting a bit and didnt mean harm. Some people see their self worth in performance and then feel bad when they cant perform. They probably meant well and I know that can still be annoying.  \nJust ... dont waste the time you have left on bad feelings.  I'd meet them and tell that emotions are high and that you want to spend your time left enjoying it with all the people you love. There is no one at fault, just very understandable stress.  \nIf you really want to know I think she failed in comforting you, so technically she's at fault and you also dont owe her an appology, but in that situation one can also basically go to someone and show that no appology is needed and all is well. Who cares who's the AH, enjoy life as long as you can.", "NTA I've recently made a new friend who somewhat in the same position. Some kind of degenerative disease where she's slowly losing her ability to talk and walk normally, as well as organ function. She's got a husband and 5 year old daughter that she'll be lucky to see make it to 10. \n\nYou know how I commented on her condition? \n\nI didn't. \n\nI was polite, offered help sparingly, shot the shit with her, and anytime her daughter 'interrupted', all my focus went to her so she wouldn't feel the need to juggle being a mom and trying to connect with an adult. Most importantly: I didn't bring up anything relating to her condition unless she brought it up and gave me permission to ask questions", "Thank you", "Thank you!  Glad to hear you are now cancer free!", "Thank you. Yea maybe. I am absolutely devastated my kids may not have a father. It\u2019s so unfair to them. I just don\u2019t feel like I caused this though and so that is why I struggle with how she said it.", "Thank you", "Yes, it's possible this was her line of thought. When my dad was dying, he told me he was worried he was \"abandoning\" us. I spent a while reassuring him about that.", "But MIL Also started to shit talk behind his back about it, MIL should def apologize To OP", "Thank you. Yes I just don\u2019t get how it makes sense in her mind.", "If she is a religious person, she may blame the dying person for bringing it on themselves", "If the person says They are blaming themselves Then sure What MIL Said would be understandable. \n\nBut in this case What MIL Said is way beyond assholery its disgusting.\n\nThe dude has terminal cancer and people here think he should dance around his inlaws feelings etc. To little time to waste on people like that.", "Sorry to hear you are dealing with that.", "Thank you. Yes a lot of her comments could go either way so I am often unsure how to take them.", "Does she mean Well? Unsolicited \u201ddont blame yourself \u201d isnt Well meaning in my book. Gossiping behind his back about it afterwards is the opposite of Well meaning. \n\nHe has to little time to waste on toxic people", "Sorry this is a bad take. The mother in law was fine until she got offended by what he said. What she should have done is apologise for her comment. She knew it hurt him so once she recognised she said the wrong thing she should have backed off. Instead she made herself the victim.", "Yeah MIL should def apologize to OP i agree", "My friend found one of the hardest things about her terminal diagnosis was other people inflicting their pre-emotive grief on her. Hearing about how hard it would be for other people when she was gone. She *knew*. She knew she was leaving young kids behind. \n\nIMO your MIL telling *you* about how hard it is for your family, rather than just figuring out how to support them and you, is also out of line. NTA for pulling her up however you need to.", "Yes, you don't need to apologise. She was being weird and at least now you won't have to hear her repeat this again, probably.\n\nUnfortunately people can be very weird about this stuff and you are probably going to hear more stupid stuff.", "A lot of people feel guilt or responsibility for things that aren't actually their fault. They shouldn't, and they may even know logically they shouldn't, but they do.\n\nMaybe your MIL read somewhere that you might feel this way so was trying to reassure you. Maybe she imagines she'd feel that way or often feels guilty about \"letting down\" or \"burdening\" her family in ways beyond her control. Maybe she knows someone or heard a story of someone who felt that way and it really affected her.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for getting angry and snapping. We all snap sometimes, and you're going through more then most. But I also wouldn't assume any malice or blame in your MIL's words.\n\nIn the future if you're looking for a better way to shut something like that down I'd say \"I know you're trying to help, but \\[whatever\\] comment/s actually make me feel worse. I'd appreciate if you didn't keep bringing it up.\" \n\nBut again, I'm not a perfect person all the time and I'm pretty healthy so I'm certainly not judging you. As for your MIL telling people you were rude, oh well? Just ignore it.", "I hope you're writing letters or making videos for them dor the future if you feel up to it.", "Hi OP. I lost my father when I was 7yo. He was 38yo. He went in to have a routine surgery, surgeons screwed up and he ended up with a pulmonary embolism; doctors didn\u2019t caught it in time and he died. I wanted you to know that not once I thought my dad could\u2019ve done anything differently. He was in pain and did what he thought it was best. For the longest time (and to this day - 27 years after his death) people still say things like \u201coh he was so young, he didn\u2019t deserve it\u201d or my top most hated one \u201cwas all in gods plan\u201d and my response is the same as yours \u201cyeah no shit he didn\u2019t deserve\u201d or \u201cwow what a great god eh? Bloody awesome to leave 3 young kids orphaned\u201d. People don\u2019t tend to take it well and IMO they should just shut up and instead of saying shit like that they could say \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, is there anything I can do to help?\u201d. NTA imo and I wouldn\u2019t apologise (I have never)", "Yeah, that is where the in-law lost me. Even if you want to assume best intentions with her irritating remarks, she should have more compassion and understanding considering OP\u2019s situation.", "Could she have assumed you felt bad about \"leaving\" your family and was trying - albeit in a cack-handed way - to offer some sort of solace for that?\n\nI probably would have responded similarly to you, by the way, in a similar situation. So you're NTA in my view. Not sure she was the AH either though. But hopefully the story will spread around the family and make the others think twice before expressing platitudes.", "It really is beyond bad what they said. But the family may rely on the IL\u2019s at a later date so it would be ideal if OP could keep things slightly cordial", "Well, either way, you are definitely not an ah.\n\nI am sorry you are going through this horrible situation.", "If I was trying to make a well meaning comment and the response was really hostile I might feel a bit offended.  We don\u2019t know exactly how OP\u2019s response to her was delivered.  What she said felt inappropriate to him, but wasn\u2019t a blatantly inappropriate comment and could be very appropriate to others in his same situation.", "And Also gossiped behind his back about it.\n\nIf i ever get cancer or sick people like that i Will not have time for Them.", "That's because what she said was highly inappropriate. The person who is dying of cancer has no obligation to make other people feel better when they have more sympathy for the victim's family than for the victim. You don't tell someone with cancer that it isn't their fault they have cancer. Why would someone even be thinking about that?"]}
