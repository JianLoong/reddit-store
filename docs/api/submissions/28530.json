It would have been a birthday present. At that time, I was living with them (circumstances not relevant). I had gotten my own place earlier than she'd anticipated, just under 2 months before my birthday. So I asked everyone to get me things for the house, as I only had 1 piece of furniture and a painting left from the previous one (My mother pushed me to sell/donate everything else, bar my clothes and sentimental items).\n\nWhen she brought it up, talking about what we would have done etc., I told her I was glad it didn't happen, because I would not have enjoyed it at all. She looked hurt. I explained that she mentioned we were to travel by plane, while I am, and she knows this, terrified of flying. A-Team's B.A. level terrified. She used to give me her anti-anxiety meds in order to get me through flights as a teenager. So, ignoring everything else, I would be beside myself with stress the whole trip, both from just having gotten of a plane, and the terror of having to get on one again in a day or 2. I'm not scared of many things, but flying (heights, actually) is one of them. \n\nBesides, I was struggling to get by then. I was constantly exhausted (full time job that was draining, and getting my masters degree at the same time) and the few hours I wasn't working or studying, I wanted to spend on things \\*I\\* found relaxing, in order to recharge and face yet another week. Mostly my very niche hobby, that's very low energy. Sightseeing in a big city was most certainly not my idea of relaxing, and between the lack of rest, and falling behind on my readings for class, the whole thing would have been more of an ordeal, than I nice break for me. Using PTO was not an option.\n\nWhy I think I might be the AH: My mother has repeatedly expressed that she feels like she doesn't know me anymore, due to her surprises often falling flat and me unsubtly mentioning things she never thought I'd want, when my birthday approaches. Since the trip was off anyway, I could have pretended that  thought it was a great idea and made her feel proud of herself for having thought of something I liked, without my input. That's important to her, and she can really do with something to boost her self esteem rn.\n\nWhy I said something anyway: I have a feeling she wants to still go and since my B-day is coming up, it would be just her style to gift me with something like that. I still don't want it, and even if I'd agree to go (she needs a break, without her husband, urgently, and it would not be the first time she disguised something for herself as a gift for me), that plane thing she insists on is non-negotiable on my end.

This theme or similar keeps coming up in this thread, including throwing parties for their vegetarian or vegan friends family and thinking that the only food they need to provide the guest of honor is some mixed greens and sliced tomatoes.   \n\n\nIf she said she wanted to go on a trip with you as a gift to HER, that would be a different discussion, but you'd still have the right to set the boundary because of the phobia.

However, just remember that even though the gift may be something she would like more than you . . . and even though she has a habit of ignoring your wishes/fears . . . and even though you did not ask for the gift, it still would have been a gift, so just saying something like, *\"Hey, I know that would have been a super generous gift, and I would have greatly appreciated the thought, I really just do not want you to waste your money on something that ultimately I would not have enjoyed.

And if she DOES gift you with a nightmare, laugh and tell her you hope she enjoys herself on the gift she bought for herself while pretending it was for you.

She wasn't thinking of you at all, except as a way to rationalize taking a trip she wanted to go on.", "NTA Take a train instead! I looooooove the train :) In fact, some train rides can be your vacation. You gotta really the like person you're with though :) Like check out the Coast Starlite train. Or one of the other long trip rides.", "I tried emphasising how happy I was with the gift she ended up getting me (antique furniture, in the same style as something of hers, which I had mentioned a few times I'd be looking for, when furniture shopping). She did show me a picture of what she wanted to buy before purchasing, which I thought was a good way of making sure the gift would be welcomed. She likes to surprise people, but unfortunately, she's just really, really bad at guessing what I would enjoy. Not sure why that is, as I share way more with her than most of my friends share with their parents (as in: she's aware of what goes on in my life, knows where I'm going in my spare time, knows about most purchases I make, bar stuff like getting a new mascara etc.), and she's usually spot on for other people. I've accepted this a long time ago, but she's still struggling with it.\n\nBut thank you for the 'script', this is a repeat-issue in my family, and it will come in handy soon enough.", "Growing up, I was basically told what I did and didn't like. And to an extent, I looked towards my mother to inform me of that, as I could get punished or ridiculed for saying the wrong thing. She wasn't the worst of the family in that regard, but I can't say she didn't do it as well.\n\nAs a teen, I started having my own opinions and stopped hiding them, whether that led to a shouting match with one family member or the other, or not. Come college, I actually was able to act on it too. And boy, did I act on it!\n\nTo be fair to my mother, I've been on a bit of a journey, figuring out who I am, what I like, what my values are etc. And if I had told my 18 year old self where I'd end up, she would have laughed in my face. So in that regard, I can appreciate that it may have been hard to keep up. However, for the last 5 years or so, I think I'm pretty predictable (with the odd surprise, I'm not totally set in my ways). Most of my friends, as well as one of my grandparents, tend to be able to guess correctly. Although my tastes are surprisingly similar to that of this particular grandparent, so that gives them an unfair advantage, lol."]}
