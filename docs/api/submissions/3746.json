We just came out of a literal global pandemic how has this dude not learnt about personal and communal hygiene yet?", "NTA. He won't stop either, he'll just try harder not to get caught.", "NTA. He knows you guys share the juice,  nobody wants backwash or wherever his mouth has been in the juice.", "NTA. This is literally the bare minimum when sharing food and he can't even do that.", "NTA, if someone can\u2019t be hygienic with food then they have to get their own.", "\"Either you understand how disgusting that was (in which case, you should completely understand why I will not share with you again) or else you think I'm overreacting (in which case, I'm absolutely doing the right thing, because you don't have a proper understanding of how inappropriate your actions were). But you can't realistically claim that you understand that what you did was wrong and *simultaneously* claim that I am overreacting.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nBut now you will need to protect your food and drinks. You never know if he will do something to it.", "NTA Drinking out of the carton/bottle of shared drinks/beverages is disgusting. Doing it whilst your eating so people get not only your germs but partially masticated food is beyond disgusting. Tom can get his own drinks. Communal beverages are not a trough.", "NTA. That\u2019s nasty especially with so many diseases going around right now.", "NTA \n\nHe is disgusting.   You could get multiple diseases from his unhygienic habits.   This is the first time you caught him doing this.  It isn't the first time he's done it.   \n\nNo more sharing is a good idea.\n\n\nAnyone who calls names is trying to deflect guilt.    He knows he's wrong so he calls you something that he thinks is insulting.  \n\nIt's not a princess thing to not to want to swap spit with your flatmate.   You're not lovers, you're roommates.  \n\nNo one in my home would do that and that includes my husband.   Because he's not a disgusting pig.", "NTA Oh heck no would I put up with that, he would have been wearing that oj the pig. Do not share would suggest a smallfridge in room for drinks and watch your other food would never trust him near it.", "NTA. Did we learn nothing from our lovely demmie the last few years?", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s nasty why would you want to drink his backwash? As a matter fact you probably already were drinking his backwash which makes it even more disgusting. Y\u2019all can get your own individual juice.", "NTA\n\nEven if Cov-19 is endemic in your country - the human mouth is filthy with bacteria that'll ruin the orange juice and potentially infect you with a disease he has. And getting food crumbs into it will just help the just getting nasty.", "No assholes here. Some people are just raised differently man. Yes, he should have asked first and it\u2019s uncalled for, but for a lot of people it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. If people, especially friends, ask to drink out of my stuff I don\u2019t really care. So if you help him understand your point of view, and he\u2019s genuine in his apology about not doing it again, might be worth reestablishing the  arrangement.\n\nI lived with a friend for a year, and our friend ship basically ended over repeated little things like this, from both sides. In the moment you feel 100% right and not overreacting, but I could go back I would. The friendship is worth making concessions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's super gross. Whether not sharing with him anymore is overreacting depends on how much you can trust him to really stop doing it.  If you think he's just saying he'll stop but really won't then I'd do the same as you.", "Rank! Eating as well. The thought of the backwash makes me shiver. \nHe won't change, as some have mentioned already, he'll just try harder not to get caught. NTA at all!!!!!!", "I'm mostly of this opinion! I think it's a bit of a red flag that he's saying OP is overreacting though; it makes me feel less trusting that he'd avoid doing it if he doesn't see why OP doesn't like it.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, I think he deserves a shot at redeeming himself since it was the first time it happens.", "you're not overreacting. eww that's disgusting. also don't trust his apology, he'll do it again when you don't watch.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, but how are you going to \u2018not share\u2019?  You still share the fridge, right?  Are you going to get a small one for your room?", "NTA \n\nMy partner and I drink from bottles in the fridge, we don\u2019t care, but if we are having guests we buy drinks specifically for them AND warn them that although they are welcome to anything, we do drink from the bottles of stuff not designated for them.", "NTA but as others have said, this is a behavior he isn't going to stop. I'm a carton drinker myself but like. Only with my stuff that is just for me and my husband (he is a carton drinker too and we don't mind sharing our cooties with each other). I would never do it at anyone else's house or to anyone else's stuff, but it's something I learned when I was really young because my alcoholic father would not share OJ (it was for his screwdrivers) so if I ever wanted any I would have to chug on the downlow. \n\nWhat I'm saying is even if you put your name on your stuff, this is still going to happen. You may have to get a fridge with a lock or keep track of levels on your cartons with a sharpie to deter this behavior. That might scare him off of even trying it.", "good idea. some people are very good at stomping all over boundaries. I would have started marking my bottles, sounds psycho lol but you just can't really trust people.", ">Yes, he should have asked first and it\u2019s uncalled\n\nHe should have asked first BEFORE putting his mouth into something other people use? \n\nSo first of all he knows it is wrong? \n\nNonsense. Y'all should go away with this level of uncleanness"]}
