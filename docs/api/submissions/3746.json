We just came out of a literal global pandemic how has this dude not learnt about personal and communal hygiene yet?", "NTA. He won't stop either, he'll just try harder not to get caught.", "NTA. He knows you guys share the juice,  nobody wants backwash or wherever his mouth has been in the juice.", "NTA. This is literally the bare minimum when sharing food and he can't even do that.", "NTA, if someone can\u2019t be hygienic with food then they have to get their own.", "\"Either you understand how disgusting that was (in which case, you should completely understand why I will not share with you again) or else you think I'm overreacting (in which case, I'm absolutely doing the right thing, because you don't have a proper understanding of how inappropriate your actions were). But you can't realistically claim that you understand that what you did was wrong and *simultaneously* claim that I am overreacting.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nBut now you will need to protect your food and drinks. You never know if he will do something to it.", "NTA Drinking out of the carton/bottle of shared drinks/beverages is disgusting. Doing it whilst your eating so people get not only your germs but partially masticated food is beyond disgusting. Tom can get his own drinks. Communal beverages are not a trough.", "NTA. That\u2019s nasty especially with so many diseases going around right now.", "NTA \n\nHe is disgusting.   You could get multiple diseases from his unhygienic habits.   This is the first time you caught him doing this.  It isn't the first time he's done it.   \n\nNo more sharing is a good idea.\n\n\nAnyone who calls names is trying to deflect guilt.    He knows he's wrong so he calls you something that he thinks is insulting.  \n\nIt's not a princess thing to not to want to swap spit with your flatmate.   You're not lovers, you're roommates.  \n\nNo one in my home would do that and that includes my husband.   Because he's not a disgusting pig.", "NTA Oh heck no would I put up with that, he would have been wearing that oj the pig. Do not share would suggest a smallfridge in room for drinks and watch your other food would never trust him near it.", "NTA. Did we learn nothing from our lovely demmie the last few years?", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s nasty why would you want to drink his backwash? As a matter fact you probably already were drinking his backwash which makes it even more disgusting. Y\u2019all can get your own individual juice.", "NTA\n\nEven if Cov-19 is endemic in your country - the human mouth is filthy with bacteria that'll ruin the orange juice and potentially infect you with a disease he has. And getting food crumbs into it will just help the just getting nasty.", "No assholes here. Some people are just raised differently man. Yes, he should have asked first and it\u2019s uncalled for, but for a lot of people it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. If people, especially friends, ask to drink out of my stuff I don\u2019t really care. So if you help him understand your point of view, and he\u2019s genuine in his apology about not doing it again, might be worth reestablishing the  arrangement.\n\nI lived with a friend for a year, and our friendship basically ended over repeated little things like this, from both sides. In the moment you feel 100% right and like you\u2019re not overreacting, but if I could go back I would. The friendship is worth making concessions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And even with that major factor aside, there's so many things that can be spread like this. It's disrespectful, and you're correct, gross.", "NTA we are literally in a global pandemic not to mention half the world is in RSV/ FLU etc season how feral to do that to shared stuff", "NTA. That's super gross. Whether not sharing with him anymore is overreacting depends on how much you can trust him to really stop doing it.  If you think he's just saying he'll stop but really won't then I'd do the same as you.", "Rank! Eating as well. The thought of the backwash makes me shiver. \nHe won't change, as some have mentioned already, he'll just try harder not to get caught. NTA at all!!!!!!", "I'm mostly of this opinion! I think it's a bit of a red flag that he's saying OP is overreacting though; it makes me feel less trusting that he'd avoid doing it if he doesn't see why OP doesn't like it.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, I think he deserves a shot at redeeming himself since it was the first time it happens.", "you're not overreacting. eww that's disgusting. also don't trust his apology, he'll do it again when you don't watch.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, but how are you going to \u2018not share\u2019?  You still share the fridge, right?  Are you going to get a small one for your room?", "NTA \n\nMy partner and I drink from bottles in the fridge, we don\u2019t care, but if we are having guests we buy drinks specifically for them AND warn them that although they are welcome to anything, we do drink from the bottles of stuff not designated for them.", "NTA but as others have said, this is a behavior he isn't going to stop. I'm a carton drinker myself but like. Only with my stuff that is just for me and my husband (he is a carton drinker too and we don't mind sharing our cooties with each other). I would never do it at anyone else's house or to anyone else's stuff, but it's something I learned when I was really young because my alcoholic father would not share OJ (it was for his screwdrivers) so if I ever wanted any I would have to chug on the downlow. \n\nWhat I'm saying is even if you put your name on your stuff, this is still going to happen. You may have to get a fridge with a lock or keep track of levels on your cartons with a sharpie to deter this behavior. That might scare him off of even trying it.", "good idea. some people are very good at stomping all over boundaries. I would have started marking my bottles, sounds psycho lol but you just can't really trust people.", ">Yes, he should have asked first and it\u2019s uncalled\n\nHe should have asked first BEFORE putting his mouth into something other people use? \n\nSo first of all he knows it is wrong? \n\nNonsense. Y'all should go away with this level of uncleanness", "Nta he is gross", "NTA. That's disgusting.", "NTA. That\u2019s Disgusting. And hello? Pandemic anyone?", "This. It feels like 5 minutes ago we were disinfecting groceries before putting them away. It's just so gross on top of being dangerous. NTA", "Yup OP, time to get your own mini fridge with a lock. It's the only way to be sure he isn't messing with your food.", "NTA. These are shared items. No one should be drinking them directly from the carton", "NTA, but...he's definitely going to keep doing that. Like, you're going to have to move your food out of the fridge if you want him to stop.", "Nta. He doesn't live with family anymore. And he is the one acting like a princess. You should be happy to share his nasty germs and backwash? No thank you.", "NTA. I am a person that drinks from the cartons, but I live alone. If I had to share with a roommate I would use a glass. If I have a visitor over and they ask for something to drink, I will exclude something if I drank from the carton when offering choices, or if we are close enough they know they can get their own drink I\u2019ll let them know if their is anything I drank from", "Think of all the times he DIDNT get caught!", "NTA, Time for a mini fridge in the bedroom. Old habits are hard to break. <nasty>", ">We just came out of a literal global pandemic\n\nWe're still in a pandemic. There's also the issue of being in flu season, and an RSV outbreak (at least in the US; \"halls\" suggests OP isn't in the US).

Tell him to buy his own crap.", "Here\u2019s the main reason, other than the eww factor, you shouldn\u2019t drink from the carton.  Your saliva mixes with the liquid which in turn starts a fermentation process.  That\u2019s why drinking milk from the carton turns it sour quickly.   The same with juices.  Enough saliva is swapped deep kissing. The same goes for drinking from cartons.", "NTA. That is so gross. Using a glass is just common decency.", "He\u2019s lying. NTA", "NTA. \n\nLike, listen, I drink for the carton/bottle/etc all the time. I also live alone and basically never have people over. When I do have people over I make sure I have unopened bottles/cartons/etc of stuff because I would never expect someone to drink from the containers I've been drinking from. It's basic decency that if you are sharing a thing, you don't put your lips to it like that.", "I am 100% a carton drinker, and honestly, among my immediate family, I don't care if anyone does it. But with your roommate? NOPE. NTA. He will 100% just try harder not to get caught.", "100% NTA, but depending on Tom it's plausible he could change his habits.\n\nI used to have the same drinking tendencies as Tom when I was younger and it was only after someone pointed out to me how disgusting it was that I stopped.\n\nSometimes people have habits they've never grown out of or given much thought to.", "RSV outbreaks are happening in UK/Ireland too, can't speak for anywhere else but can't see why it wouldn't be everywhere", "definitely still around since my husband is currently quarantined in basement while I am self quarantining on main floor.  \n\nHowever what your roommate did is disgusting ignoring any pandemic, flu season or RSV outbreak. You don't drink directly from communal container.", "NTA that is a very good way to share germs, and there are some pretty bad illnesses out there right now.", "NTA... that is gross but is it about you not believing that he will stop? If he stick to his word then why not  continue.  Is this a punishment thing?", "just.....eww NTA", "listen I'm a gross person and I might do that if I'm not sharing with anybody (reiterating it's because I'm a pig) but absolutely not if I am. It is disgusting and you are not only within your right to withhold dairy and OJ but I believe completely right", "NTA. He will continue despite saying he would stop.", "NTA.  The princess and the pig.", "Years ago my husband had a friend that would do this when visiting if he thought neither of us was looking. He was cured the day he took a big slug of iced tea from a gallon pitcher, only to get a mouthful of partially jellied beef stock. Then got yelled at by both of us.\n\nNTA.", "OP=NTA\n\nThat's disgusting.  You are NOT overreacting.  BACKWASH is a thing, I have NO DESIRE to drink someone else's backwash.\n\nMind, once you are in a relationship and/or when you have children, sharing backwash may become a thing(kids will drink out of your cup/bottle/can with or without your permission).  BUT heck to the NOPE on random roommate.", "This one's a bit of a toss up.  While I agree that Tom should not have been drinking straight from the carton, especially these days with Covid still out there, I think you over reacted a bit here.  You called him out on it (which was the right thing to do), he apologized and said he wouldn't do it again.  At this point you should have accepted his apology and given him another chance.  Your refusal to do so, makes YTA in this case.", "Um, global pandemic.  Also, gross.  NTA.", "And not just germs. To drink while you eat.. The chance that some of the food get from the mouth flushed inside the bottle is big - depending how you drink. Just disgusting. \n\nTo take a glas isn't so hard! But oh no, cleaning the glas or putting it in the dishwasher! Just too much work /s", "We are getting absolutely rocked by covid, RSV, and flu A in Chicago. He\u2019s gross"]}
