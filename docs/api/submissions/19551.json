There was literally no reason for it besides wife said no.", "No worries \ud83d\udc4d", "This convo would have been on a call, dad wouldn't have heard OPs response but probably assumed it was handled", "If stepmom heard it, then dad heard it. Also, he still assumed and is now mad it didn't work out how they wanted it to. They both suck, but OP asked the dad to relay the message not stepmom.", "Yes but that still doesn't make dad the bigger asshole?", "IMO it does cause the request was made to him and as such he had more responsibility than the wife. He still should have told the daughter.", "I'll probably get a ton of down -votes for this. So be it!  YTA because you are thinking about yourself & the money you will lose instead of your sister. I have not read through all of the comments yet. But you didn't mention in your post that you would be fired. You also also said that you're very well off. I obviously don't know you or your family. But this is about you & your sister, NOT anyone else! Please think about that!   Edit: accidentally left out a word.", "NTA- She just doesnt want to be the blame for you not being around. Had she not stuck her nose in a convo that didnt involve her all would be Gucci now. It's rather ugly to expect someone to lose large amount of income just to appease a mess they made.", "Nta", ">I earn roughly 3X the national American average. Which is great because it means I will be able to afford a life. \n\nBig fucking mood", "Yo stepmom ITA .... big time", "NTA \u2014 but really, why did you listen to your stepmom? That\u2019s seriously awful advice and clearly your sister would have wanted to know", "NTA.  They don't pay your bills, they don't dictate when you take off without pay.", "Stepmother ITA", "NTA. Although, to be honest, after your stepmom said that, I would have gone ahead and reached out to my sister directly. \n\n*Hey I don't expect you to plan around me but here is my schedule in case you need it for shower planning. Feel free to pass it on.*\n\nI know the mom to be doesn't plan the shower but since she lives with her mom I'm assuming she had an idea planning was going on. If she had passed it on and then her mom picked a date you worked on, at least she would have had a calendar to check your availability on.", "I would have said NTA if the situation was a bit different. People have to work and from what you're saying, stepmom is TAH too. Your sister did nothing wrong and is definitely NTA\n\nBut I think underneath it all, YTA, for these reasons:\n\n- you're very very open about the good money you make but also can't take time off and lose out on that money?  You act as if you cant afford it or something... but you're quick to brag about making 3x the national average and it sounds like you're quick to remind your family of it too. Yes $7000 sounds like a lot of money, but if you're making that much for just 14 DAYS, then it is not the same value as $7000 for most of the people reading this. If you consistently make that in 14 days you are pulling in $182,000 a year. So yeah, you can  show people your pay stubs (which seems weird and unnecessary btw), but losing $7000 is relative to how much money you have and make \n- I would still get if you can't miss work or don't want to because of the situation (although it is 100% not your sister's fault so that kinda sucks for her). But you're asking them to PAY YOU $6000 to come? Seriously?? Oh and also you're saying they have to buy the $1000 stroller that you said YOU would buy?? That is absolutely ridiculous. And honestly, I wouldnt be surprised if theres a lot of history here that's caused issues between you and the stepmom and her comments about you wanting to control things. It sounds like you're trying to control things now. \n\nI've started to wonder recently if it's exactly this kind of behaviour that makes people rich more than anything else. Stop demanding money from people when you neither need it nor are you entitled to it.", "NTA. Your stepmother should\u2019ve butted out of it and your dad should\u2019ve stood up for you. \n\nYour sister has every right to be pissed at her. You have every right to tell them they were wrong bc they were. I hope they pay you. Or they can move the shower.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, what  is a fly in fly out camp? I've never heard this before.", "ESH. If they wanted you there they should have asked about your schedule. But you could have made that clear without asking them to pay you to attend.", "Seriously. Ask any of the complainers if they would be willing to take a week off unpaid from their work for anything.", "Exactly. Classic projection on SM's part.", "Work camp. OP is most likely in the oil and gas industry. I work in the industry as well, though not a shift like hers.\n\nBasically, the company flies you in to the town and you work on site for usually 2 weeks at a time, then they fly you home on your days off which is usually 1 or 2 weeks. Really good money, obviously lol. I've done a few jobs like that but I'm personally not a fan. You generally work 10-12 hour days every day and you stay in a work camp. Tiny rooms, usually shit food. But you get used to camp life and develop a routine.", "For our terminology with this industry, \"a shift\" refers to the entire duration you're at work. In OP's case, her shift is 2 weeks on (working) and 2 weeks off (at home). With this work, you can't come and go. There's very few flights, so you either stay your entire 2 week shift or you go home for the 2 weeks. You can't just hop on a plane and come and go when you please.", "Except, sister was likely not the one planning the shower. Stepmom was, and likely wanted to prove that she could make OP look bad or do what she wanted.", "THANK YOU, why is no one else saying this", "I dont get why people are downvoting this", "Oil and gas industry. It's tough work with long days and long shifts. Great money but not everyone thinks it's worth it because of the toll it takes on your mind and body.", "No, she can't. That's not how this line of work operates. If you have a fly in/fly out job, you are there for your entire 2 week shift or you go home and sit there for your entire 2 week shift. You can't hop on a plane and come and go as you please. OP most likely lives in another province than the one she works in. Flights for these jobs are also very staggered.", "And also demands that people pay them for lost income to attend a baby shower \ud83d\ude44", "Missing a \"shift\" is a month of pay. Could you afford to miss an entire month worth of pay?", "YES omg", "Except, OP is fly in, fly out. Which means the company they work for flies them to a remote location for 2 weeks, then flies them home for a week. If they miss that flight out, they miss out on two weeks of pay. The company isn't going to charter a small plane to the middle of nowhere just for them.", "If sister didn\u2019t have some hand in planning the shower, then why did she say \u201cyou should have told me\u201d?", "No but I definitely could if I was making $7k/month after taxes and deductions.", "Because she has a better chance of convincing her mother to do what she wants than OP does?", "Because rent and bills just stop for that month? Maybe you should focus on learning a more valuable skill rather than telling OP how they should plan their life and money.", "Exactly.. and OP says its 14 days worth of pay, not monthly, and they make 3x the  national average. I think its less than a months worth of pay", "Yeah, technically the Guest of Honor isn't supposed to plan her own baby shower, she is after all, the GUEST of honor, not the hostess of honor.\n\nWhile I'm sure she was consulted as to what date would work, if her mother was helping plan it, or consulting with whomever the hostess was, she could have said \"well I talked to OP, so whatever date is fine\" and the hostess would have presumed they were fine to schedule it.  \n\nIt would have been a bit weird if the sister was talking to OP directly about dates because that's not normally how showers are planned.", "It\u2019s not about controlling the stupid woman it\u2019s about passing along the message as OP asked", "He could have bypassed his wife and relayed the message. He didn't have to control anyone. Not BEING controlled by his wife would be enough.", "It\u2019s controlling to say \u201cI can handle this\u201d?", "That's...not what they said", "It is the sister\u2019s baby shower, why is he listening to the step mom?", "We don\u2019t know if stepmom was planning the shower at all though. We know that dad was acting as a go-between for his two daughters and stepmom offered her un-asked for opinion during a phone call between OP and her father.\n\nAnd we know that sister specifically said \u201cyou should have called me so that I could have planned for you to be here.\u201d\n\nWhich is a mighty strong indication that sister is planning at least some aspect of the shower.", "Maybe op should learn a more valuable life skill than demanding thousands of dollars from family in order to attend a baby shower lol", "because it sounds like the step mom was the one planning it?\nedit- also op is a she.", "It was standard etiquette for decades. Has since relaxed but yes, showers thrown by immediate family members was previously considered very tacky.", "The sister is still part of the planning. It\u2019s her baby shower.", "not always.. typically it\u2019s someone else planning the baby shower for the mother to be.", "The sister was planning it in this story at least.\n\nIn all baby showers I know of the mom-to-be is a big part of planning as she picks out the registry, picks a date, etc.", "seems to me that she only picked the registry and possibly the date but again, it would have been her mom who picked it (the date) \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
