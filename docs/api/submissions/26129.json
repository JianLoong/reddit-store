It works with my schedule and my life.  And when I do want time off throughout the rest of the year, as my adult children and I travel together for a week in February/March in place of killing ourselves to gather during holidays, my coworkers are more than happy to respect my time off.  It\u2019s a bit of give and take in a workplace.  It\u2019s up to you if you want to be a part of that community and that give and take.

Which meant I could catch up on my work without being pulled away or distracted all day.  Frankly, December as a month was kind of a slow shutdown as nobody wanted anything worthwhile to happen too close to Christmas or New Year's. They all just wanted to be out of the office. Also, nobody stays a full day in that week between Christmas and New years.

I also happily switch my on-call weeks with others when they want to take that time off - it's not like I have to work more, I'm just changing *when* I do it.\n\nThen around Christmas I take my time off all at once and bugger off for about 6 weeks. Never had a complaint, or any trouble finding someone to switch call weeks if I have to.\n\nDoing it the reddit way will only make you \"that guy\" at work.", "I can see your point, yes. My own experience cloud my judgment, but I don\u2019t like how they\u2019re using the kids to make OP feel bad. B/c, like you said, that it\u2019s not about the kids, but about spending time with family. They are specifically calling her the AH cuz she is child free and that makes her selfish. I mean, they could\u2019ve said all of that a bit different. But again, I can see your point, I just really hate when people call childless people selfish for not helping parents.", "nope, i never understood that. i can barely breathe out of one nostril and i haven\u2019t eaten anything besides a single saltine and y\u2019all want me to hunt people down to cover me? no, the MANAGER needs to do that. and if they can\u2019t find anyone, the MANAGER should step in and cover that shift", "Do you not have the internet?  TV? I don't get this...", "Yes from personal experience I know this. Even lost out on a promotion and more hours because \u201cyou don\u2019t have a mortgage to pay\u201d yes because I can\u2019t get on the property ladder on stupid part time hours!", "Right but they get a day off regardless and if they don\u2019t care about Christmas why not just take it another day", "Oh I'm not any more, I was for a long time. I still will swap if it suits me but I don't fuck myself over any more.", "And a 7am start on new year's day at that I bet. Sure you partied on nye! Til 9pm when you had to get your shit sorted to work the next morning. What a treat.", "I have a couple of people now that I won't even look to see if I can swap when they ask. I just can't swap, ever.", "It's shit isn't it. I've always been flexible because I really believe it's part of my job and I realise that it's shit when you're missing something for working crappy hours that most people don't have to work, but when you realise it's one way it feels really shitty.", "Cool. That's a nice memory.", "My wife is a RN and has to work most holidays. Even I remember the times someone has switched so she could either be home for Christmas or at least go in late.", "I'm a single mother, and I would offer to work on a holiday if one of my clerks, also a single mother, landed on that holiday. And I absolutely hated her as a person. But, I was used to working holidays and my son was used to being in my office. Again, I did not like her, and i wasn't a clerk, but I still thought it was a nice thing to do. Plus, I was salary, so it kept overtime down.\n\nYes, I did do this for the non-parent clerks too at times.", "This was 20+ years ago, no Internet but yes TV, but I didn't equate television with real life. Utah is a unique cultural bubble in America."]}
