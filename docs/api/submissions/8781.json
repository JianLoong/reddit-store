I became very close with his wife, Emma. Both of my pregnancies coincided with hers. We live about 10 minutes away from another so our kids have grown up together more as siblings.\n\nLast summer, Nigel and Emma got a mutual divorce. They had grown apart and wanted different things out of life. Emma kept the house while Nigel moved. During the divorce, she kept her space from me which I understood. The issue became, Emma was always the one to arrange get together with the extended family. Nigel left it all to her. So, when I\u2019d try to get together with him so the two of us could visit and the kids could see each other, he was always too busy or simply didn\u2019t want to get together.\n\nMy kids really missed their cousins. I tried asking my brother to just drop them off for an afternoon but he understandably said he wanted to spend their time together. Nigel is introverted. We get along but he tends to keep to himself. \n\nEventually, Emma contacted me and said the kids really wanted to see mine. I agreed to meet up. They all had a blast and it was nice to see Emma again. We agreed to go back to meeting up once a week on the weeks she had them, on the understanding that we\u2019d never discuss Nigel but we never did before anyway.\n\nI told Nigel and he was pissed. He said I can\u2019t see his ex. I said it was for the kids and if he met up with us more (not even once a week, just at least sometimes), I wouldn\u2019t do that.  He said the kids will get over it and that they\u2019ll live seeing each other on holidays. I asked if there was a reason he didn\u2019t want me hanging out with Emma, like she had done something to hurt him and he said no. Their divorce was truly mutual and more his fault than anything (his words). He just feels it\u2019s weird. I said if it makes him feel better, we can do it where Emma and I rotate taking the kids so our contact is limited but he said then I\u2019m still talking to her.\n\nUltimately, I told him he was being unreasonable. My kids (11 & 8) have a bond with their cousins (10 & 8). I have a bond with my niece and nephew. He doesn\u2019t have to give up his time with them or hang out with people more than he wants to, but he can\u2019t stop me from doing this. He didn\u2019t argue any further but was clearly upset.\n\nI was talking about this with my husband\u2019s sister, who I\u2019m also very close to. She said she\u2019d 100% cut me off if I ever divorced my husband and she understands why Nigel feels I should do the same with Emma. She asked how I\u2019d feel if he did this with my husband should we divorce and I said I wouldn\u2019t mind.

Unless there's a good reason not to meet up with Emma, Nigel doesn't get to dictate who you're freinds are.  If say Emma didn't have custody of her kids and was using you to get access.... or if she was abusive etc, I can see it.   But sorry... \"I feel weird\" is a childs response.  Nigel needs to suck it up for the sake of his kids.  I have a VERY different relationship with the cousins I saw regularly vs the ones I only saw at holidays. (HINT: the ones I only saw on holidays aren't really a part of my adult life and I haven't seen them in years or even decades)\n\nIt's not like when our parents were kids and most people lived close to where they grew up etc.  Families move around now... so if your kids have the chance to have a steady relationship with family that's a positive experience DON'T LET GO OF THAT.", "NTA\n\nThe drama and problems between ADULTS should not punish the kids. They are still cousins and your brother is an AH if he demands they lose that relationship", "NTA. If she didn't do anything wrong, I don't see why you're obligated to cut her off. This sort of \"everyone has to take sides after a breakup/divorce\" attitude is really unhealthy imo.", "NTA\n\nMy brother is divorced. I still talk to my ex-SIL. She's still my \"family\" as the mother to my niece and nephew. \n\nI don't discuss my brother with her, although they are on good terms. \n\nYou are doing what's best for your kids by maintaining a relationship with their family. Period.", "As a person who was in your kids' situation, fuck Nigel. Absolutely NTA.\n\nWhen I was little my dad left. We almost never saw him until we actually stopped seeing him altogether. My grandfather also stopped seeing us. My aunts and uncles and cousins disappeared from our lives. My grandmother was the only person who ever had continual contact with us.\n\nIt left a lot of hurt and abandonment issues which have permeated my whole life and personality. Lots of feelings of resentment and anger and feeling like I don't belong or know where I'm from.\n\nOnce I became an adult I realized how angry I was at my aunts and uncles for taking my cousins away. My grandmother died on boxing day and I saw my cousins for the first time in like 25 years. It was incredibly hard for so many reasons. I was so angry to hear my cousin's eulogy and really see how much alike her and I are. That bond we could have had was stolen from me when I was an innocent child because the adults in our lives couldn't act like adults.\n\nSo no, you are NTA. Don't ever stop seeing your nieces and nephews.", "NTA. I never could understand why people think it\u2019s perfectly natural to just cut people out in situations like these. There\u2019s no acrimony, so where\u2019s the issue? \n\nAt the end of the day, you even went through him first, but he was disinterested. Your children\u2019s relationship with their cousins doesn\u2019t cease to exist because the parents decided to divorce.\n\nAlso, take note of your SIL. Because that\u2019s a pretty shitty attitude and God forbid you divorce, all that time and emotion cultivating that relationship means nothing to her.", "NTA your brother is a yappy little baby. Let your kids see their friends and you enjoy seeing yours", "NTA \n\nYou and your ex Sil have the right idea. The cousins love each other and you are friends with her. That goes beyond your brother. You're allowed to see people that you want to see. Your brother doesn't get to control your life. He should be happy the cousins are so close.", "NTA\n\nAnd for what it's worth, it sounds like you and ex-SIL were friends. And you know what? That matters too. You don't have to stop being close to someone because \"he feels wierd\". He needs to be an adult.\n\nAlso, the kids obviously but previous comments already pointed that out.", "NTA - your kids deserve to see their cousins, if your brother can\u2019t handle that then tell him he doesn\u2019t get to control who you are friends with", "Try to frame it like this: during a divorce, seeing the cousins regularly provides the kids some well needed stability that can be a lifeline, and it's certainly good for their mental health. I just hope they don't grow to resent their father for keeping them away from their cousins.", "Nigel divorced Emma. His kids did not divorce their cousins. \n\nThey are too young to get together on their own, so grown-ups need to step in. And clearly your brother doesn't want to be the grown-up. \n\nThe husband's sister is right that each divorce is different. However, I don't agree that the kids should be punished for the divorce.", "NTA. Nigel is centering himself here, but the important folks are the kids, both his and yours. His kids need stability in their lives. They need family and familiarity. If Nigel us unwilling or unable to put their needs first, then it\u2019s good you can step up. \n\nAlso I\u2019d watch out for your husband\u2019s sister. She\u2019s straight out told you that your only worth in her life is as her brother\u2019s spouse. You may not actually be as close as you believe.", "NTA I might be in the minority (and according to the divorced couples I've been friends with over the years who required that their mutual friends 'choose', I am) but I don't believe that just because your romantic relationship ended means that my friendship with one of you has to. Not my circus, not my monkeys.", "NTA but you have to tread carefully.  If My wife's sister and her husband were to split, I would continue to have a friendship with her husband because he is my friend and we were part of the same family so long that we are now \"forever family.\"  If my SIL then demanded that I cut off ties with him, it would be her asking me to stop spending time with one of my best friends.  On the other hand, obviously this has some family dynamics to it as well though which you have to be mindful of.  IMO Nigel needs to grow up.", "NTA, the kids have a right to be with family. If this was a safety concern and not the whim of a hurt adult it would be a different story.", "I get that it may be uncomfortable for him, but I don't think he gets to tell you who you can and cannot see. He is also not even there, you don't discuss him, and he will not make time for the children. Nigel is putting his feelings before his children's. NTA.", ">She asked how I\u2019d feel if he did this with my husband should we divorce and I said I wouldn\u2019t mind. She pointed out I won\u2019t know how he feels until I\u2019m in the middle of it. \n\nWhy would she ask you about your feelings if she doesn't think you'd know anyways? \n\nAnyways NTA \n\nI don't think your brother is much of an ah either, a little nosy and bordering on controlling but ultimately he's gone through a very drastic life change and it feels weird to know he's still indirectly connected to his ex. It'll take time to adjust but he will be fine.", "NTA - if it was just that you were hanging out with his ex all the time, I could maaaaybe see where he's coming from. But that's not the case at all, and he needs to think of what's best for his children. You gave him plenty of opportunity to arrange a suitable time and date for him, even going as far as to say that could just drop the kids off with you, and he still refused. At this point, he's punishing his children for something that is 100% not their fault.", "NTA. You are free to be friends with anyone you want. Nobody else can decide that for you. It doesn't seem like Emma treated your brother badly and that would be the thing that would stop me from continuing to spend time with a sibling's ex, assuming I really liked them. Also, since your kids want to spend time together and your brother isn't facilitating that, I see no reason why you shouldn't. (Nice to know your other SIL views your friendship as conditional.)", "NTA. Their divorce is no reason to alienate either you or your kids from their cousins and her mother. He admits she did nothing wrong. I have always figured the more people that that love the kids...the better. I've never understood the \"never see/talk to them again\" mindset either, unless it were to be in a situation of abuse and likely cheating (and the cheating wouldn't affect my relationship with children who are victims).", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m suspicious of anything this obvious in this sub, but I can\u2019t really see anything you left out.\n\nBarring a situation that puts someone in danger, no-one gets to tell you who you can be friends with.  Full stop.", "Nta. Nigel can grow up and get over it easier than your kids can. Keep letting those cousins hang out", "NTA. It is not right that the children have to suffer, especially if the divorce was truly mutual.\n\nBut it's not like you are sneaking his children around somebody against his wishes - his children still spend time with their mother so what does it matter if you take your children over from time to time to see them? Divorce is not easy, maybe he just needs time to adjust to the changes.", "NTA. Maybe this differs from family to family, though. People's exes are always at my family's gatherings, because they're still co-parenting. Once you have kids together, your families are always bonded, even if you divorce.", "NTA! Unless Emma somehow betrayed him, there is no reason why you should cut her out of the family. All the children will benefit, and Nigel is being selfish to declare otherwise.", "Your brother needs to grow up a bit. Just because he is now divorced does not mean that all family ties should be cut.\n\nThe kids deserve to still see each other and it is good for you & sister-in-law to have each other as someone who you can trust with the children. Keep doing what is best for the kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA. His lack of prioritizing the family is probably part of the divorce if he thinks that 52x a year down to 4 or 5x for holidays and cookouts is close to enough to maintain the relationships.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your brother\u2019s place to decide who you can be friends with. Don\u2019t talk about her with him and Vice versa. I\u2019d be sad if I was forced into a lack of a relationship with my cousins because my parents couldnt/wouldn\u2019t talk. Keep letting your kids get together. This challenge is just a difficulty of him alienating everyone after divorce.", "NTA. You and Emma are putting your kids' interests ahead of adult issues, which is exactly what good parents do. The other adults in the situation are being immature and selfish. \n\nMy parents have been divorced for over 15 years, after almost 30 years of marriage, and my mom still joins my dad's family for Christmas, invites my dad's family over for family events, etc, both because they developed their own relationships independently from my dad after all that time and also because it was in the best interest of the kids (and now grandkids). \n\nNigel isn't an AH for being uncomfortable with your seeing Emma, but he's an AH for putting his own discomfort above continuing relationships that are clearly in the best interest of the kids.", "NTA, sounds like you have yours and your brother's children's best interests at heart and want to maintain their previously good relationship, if your brother can't get over that he needs to have a word with himself.", "Nta, husband\u2019s sister is incredibly immature not to take into account the existing relationship between the cousins/kids.", "NTA - it feels like he just doesn't want his two worlds to intersect now that he is divorced, and (here is the problem) is willing to let his own children suffer as a result of his pettiness.\n\nIn most cases one parent can't dictate who the other parent is with during non-custodial times, so you are more than free to have time with the cousins to play. It is healthy and if they all get along, why not?", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re facilitating your children\u2019s friendships. What you\u2019re doing is good and healthy for their socialization, and will show them that sometimes when adults have adult conflicts (like divorce), you don\u2019t automatically lose *all* your important relationships. It\u2019s stabilizing, and it\u2019s possible it will be a huge emotional relief for your niece and nephew, whom you care about.\n\nYou\u2019ve offered every accommodation, have offered to step back if your brother wants to help arrange these play dates, and you and your ex-SIL have clear boundaries about discussing your brother/her ex-husband. You two even floated not being social with each other and just taking turns hosting the kids individually you\u2019re bending over backwards.\n\nYou\u2019ve done everything right in my view.", "NTA. It\u2019s not up to him.", "absolutely NTA. Divorce does not have to divide families. I'm glad you and Emma have a relationship so the kids don't have to suffer.", "NTA\n\n\nBut I would be wary of your SIL (the one who said she\u2019d cut you off) as cutting someone off completely (just because they\u2019re not married to your sibling anymore) is extreme\u2026", "NTA, you\u2019re putting your children first, he\u2019s repeatedly refused requests to facilitate contact between the cousins on his time and admits it isn\u2019t even as if it was an acrimonious separation or his ex did something bad to him so there\u2019s really no reason to take sides. And what your husband\u2019s sister said was unnecessary and makes it clear your connection is completely conditional to her, which is sad since you considered you were close. So I wouldn\u2019t take her opinion into consideration, if she wouldn\u2019t care about you if you weren\u2019t with your husband, why should she get a say in your family? Sorry that you are having to deal with this drama, hopefully things will settle down as more time passes since the divorce and Nigel sees how happy his children are about maintaining contact with his family, since their happiness should be his priority.", "NTA your brother is being unreasonable. Divorces are already hard enough on kids and not just the kids in the family that got the divorce, all of the kids who are used to seeing those children that don\u2019t get to see them anymore are hurt by it as well as the kids that are close to aunts or uncles that are suddenly no longer there. Everyone gets hurt in a divorce (even a mutual one). You and his ex are just trying to make sure that the kids don\u2019t end up hurting. Also it\u2019s really upsetting to me that he says that they\u2019ll just get over it because that means he doesn\u2019t care how the kids feel in the now because he thinks it\u2019ll all be fine in the future and it doesn\u2019t always happen that way.", "NTA - You are doing this for the children. I could understand cutting her out of your life if she had an affair etc but for a mutual divorce, she can still be an ex SIL and a friend.", "\"He said I can\u2019t see his ex\"\n\nHe doesn't get to gatekeep your friendships.\n\n\"Ultimately, I told him he was being unreasonable.\"\n\n100% agreement.

You missed your friend, and your children missed their cousins. And, you now know that your SIL is not your friend.", "NTA your brother is not considering his kids or their feelings. He is an AH for not letting the cousins get together on his weeks.", "NTA. \n\nMy MIL keeps in contact with the mother of my youngest bonus child to the extent of going and getting tattoos with each other, getting meals without the grandchild, sleeping over at each other's homes when they're in town, etc. \n\nIf it was this kind of situation, you'd still not be the AH, but your brother wouldn't be for feeling weird about it, either. \n\nYou are doing what is best for the kids, and if he isn't careful about how he words that with other people, especially his ex, he may end up losing what custody he does have, because he is prioritizing his comfort over his kids' best interests.", "NTA. Also red flag on your SIL. Does she not see your brother isolating his children from his own family. My family is about loyalty but never at the expense of children mental health.", "NTA but I'd be wary of your husband's sister.", "NTA. If you were on good terms predivorce. Nothing should change.

Side eying that one. \n\nI'm sure Emma is a pleasant person, but let's face it, you see her for all the kids' sakes, which include your own nieces and nephews.\n\nYour brother is a lazy parent who doesn't care about his children's emotional needs. Their parents have split and now they have to lose the cousins they're close too because dad  won't make time.

The fact he thinks they don\u2019t need to see their cousins and you don\u2019t even need to see your niece and nephew demonstrates he only cares about how this effects him and has no regard for anyone else in this situation.\n\nOn the other hand, can you demonstrate to your brother that *you* are willing to compromise by letting the cousins come by without Emma?  Just have her drop them off for a few hours or a sleep over?   You guys switch off like this once in a while.   I do think one a week while she has them is a bit excessive in this situation. Once a month or even every other month seems like plenty. Again, in this particular situation, at least. \n\nI know that might be hard for Emma, though, since she\u2019s giving up time while she has them.", "YTA for even contemplating undermining your own friendship with Emma just because your brother is being a WATB. Tell him you will consort with whomever you choose, and his claim to authority over what you do and the people you meet is risible. You might as well have told him that he wasn\u2019t allowed to divorce Emma because it would make your friendship with her occasionally awkward.

If he can't or won't, Emma can also choose who she and her children spend time with when they're with her.", "NTA. He is being unreasonable. Your kids should absolutely be allowed to see each other more than just holidays. Especially if he won't take the initiative to get together with you so they can hang out together.\n\nHe can just be pissy about it. It's absolutely ridiculous that he expects you to cut her off just because they divorced.\n\nLol my parents split when I was a toddler and my mom never stopped seeing his side of the family. When he was being especially difficult she called my grandmother and tattled on him to his mom and he'd be calling back to apologize.", "NTA.  Their divorce was mutual and it is for the kids to visit each other.  The kids liking each other will probably change over the years as they grow, so do it now.  I could see cutting you off if there was some sort of resentment/hostility/child custody battle/child support/alimony issue, but there is not.", "They would cut you off... but what about... you know.... the kids? Are they no longer family?\n\nNTA OP, but your in-laws sound like a riot. I feel for the kids who are suffering the most.", "NTA\n\nMy brother dated a lovely girl who despite being a decade younger than me became a good friend of mine, she was and still is a good aunt to my kids. My brother cheated on her with her best friend and they split up. My brother is an asshole for many reasons, some relating to my childhood (he is 9 years older than me) so I gladly chose his ex over him and haven't spoken to him since 2014. His ex has gone on to marry a super guy, they now have two children of their own. My asshole brother made a stink about it but I just cut him out, no regrets. It was long overdue \n\nA bit different to OP's situation, but it's the kids who are important here and Nigel needs to understand that. Keep the adult drama separate. \n\nGood luck, OP. You have the right of it, IMO.", "Absolutely NTA. My aunt (by marriage) and uncle (my father's brother) got divorced when I was 10 or 11. Their three children, my cousins, are all in a similar age range as my brother and myself.\n\nWe were close friends and talked all the time during and after the divorce. My aunt, whom I still call my aunt, always welcomed us into her home. She always allowed us to stay over. As we got older, she would let us work in her small shop on holidays to fund our vacations together.  \n\nEven today the bond I have with those cousins is so precious and special.\n\nIt sounds like everyone else is letting their personal pettiness get in the way instead of helping these children foster deep, loving, (hopefully) long-lasting bonds together.", "NTA. I think your brother is being completely unreasonable. Your children missed their cousins. They are now happy with the new arrangement. You offered an alternative with meetups with your brother. He turned it down. What else could you do? You didn't do it to spite him (no matter what he thinks). \n\nI would sincerely miss my SIL if I was in this situation. Our children have such a close bond and it's great to see when we all meet up (maybe 3-5 times a year). We talk all the time and we all get on well. Your brother needs to be more civil. This is for the children's benefit.", "NTA, ask his sister how she would feel if her brother decided to keep the children from her but she could see them through you. If she's as decent an aunt as you she would jump at the chance to get to spend time with them.", "NTA. You and Emma seem to be the only adults in this relationship. Just keep it as a don't ask/don't tell situation and if your brother brings it up, just say \"bygones\" and change the subject.", "NTA - Not your circus, not your monkeys. Their divorce is none of your business and it\u2019s not like you meet to gossip over Nigel. These kids are your nephews and you have a right so see them and have contact with them, and you basically see each other for the kids, yours and them, it\u2019s in their interest, so it should be in his. And I don\u2019t think your other SIL would cut you off if it\u2019d be the only way to see your kids. That\u2019s BS. Or she doesn\u2019t care about them.", "NTA\nI was in a similar-ish position: I dated somebody with a child of a similar age to mine, the kids became very close. When we broke up, the children were parted with no explanation (I did try to get then together for a playdate to explain things but was ignored and it seems the other child was told not to speak to mine anymore). My now adult daughter still talks about how weird it was to see her almost sister at school but not be allowed to talk to her and not really understanding why. The kids won't \"get over it\" they will remember how this divorce created a massive gap between them and they will know the adults are to blame. Your brother needs to get over himself, he does get to decide how you spend your time or who you spend it with.", "Right? And just because Nigel is a shut in who wants to keep even *his own family* at a distance shouldn't mean that the kids have to be, if someone else is willing to facilitate the relationship.", "NTA. OP, you've told your brother, no need to talk about it further. Enjoy your time with your family, and just don't turn it into a big deal. Don't involve other people. Don't post all over social media. Just make it about you, your kids, and those kids.", "Wow. NTA. First of all, it\u2019s a bit sad that your brother puts his needs before those of his children. HIS children want to see their cousins. The divorce has probably been a big adjustment for them. Having FAMILY friends your own age is already very meaningful for children and plays an even greater role in situations where parents get divorced. \n\nSecondly, your brother cannot dictate to Emma what she does when she has their children. You reached out to him, and he simply could not be bothered to make a meet up happen. The fact that he cannot see that it is about the children and not Emma is really strange. He perhaps needs to seek counseling to undergo his own journey of healing. You cannot claim a divorce was amicable and mutual and act in this way. Well\u2026you can, but you are lying to yourself and others. \n\nNTA NTA NTA and I feel bad for all involved and how much of this is because of one person who claims he has nothing against his ex wife.", "1000 percent.

He can't stop you. He doesn't get to dictate who you see, or who his ex sees. He removed himself from that equation.", "NTA  The kids dont have to pay the price.  Keep meeting up with them.  In a couple of years, they will be old enough to meet up on their own.", "NTA. \n\nMy husband had an uncle that is divorced and the other aunts/uncles didn't talk shit, but the dialog was very \"she isn't really family anymore\" apparently. Which he always thought was bullshit since she was still his cousins mother. So I'm glad to know he's unlikely to feel the way of your brother.", "NTA. He can't dictate who you're friends with just because he doesn't want to have any contact with her. And as you say the cousins are all friends so it would be mean to them to deprive them of that contact. Just because he wants to be unsociable doesn't mean he gets to force that on the rest of you.", "Nta as far as you know there wasn't some crazy, violent reason behind the divorce. He *also* had the opportunity to fo cousin play date's and he declined.   Why should then kids suffer bc he can't be bothered to actively parent his kids?", "What is it with people thinking their opinion of \"weird\" should control what ither people do?! My brother didn't want our grandfather to come live with me solely because \"It's weird.\" What does that even mean?!\n\nNTA Your brother is not the boss of you and Emma - he has NO RIGHT to object to whom either of you spend time with.", "NTA\n\n> He said I can\u2019t see his ex.\n\nHe got a divorce. He doesn\u2019t get to use that to control who his ex visits, or who you visit.\n\n> He said the kids will get over it and that they\u2019ll live seeing each other on holidays.\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t have to. Children shouldn\u2019t be cut off from their other family and friends because the adults divorced.\n\n> He just feels it\u2019s weird. \n\nThen he needs to figure out real quick how to come to terms with that. \n\n> My kids (11 & 8) have a bond with their cousins (10 & 8). I have a bond with my niece and nephew. \n\nKids shouldn\u2019t lose supportive adults in their lives because parents don\u2019t want to handle the awkwardness of post-divorce relationships with extended family and their ex\u2019s.\n\n> She said she\u2019d 100% cut me off if I ever divorced my husband\n\nAgain, an adult putting adult feelings over the needs of children.

OK, sure, we probably wouldn't see as much of her, and we certainly wouldn't discuss my brother with her, but we've spent years with her as a member of our family. We love her.

Sheesh! You are doing the exact right thing. Why should your kids and your niblings be punished because the adults can't manage themselves? That's ridiculous. Good for you for keeping that relationship going, establishing good boundaries, and modeling good grown up behavior for your kids.", " Yta your sil is crazy.

I think you could turn this around on your other SIL as to what does cutting off your ex SIL to the detriment of your kids relationships teach them?

The kids deserve to spend time with their cousins and more than just at holidays.", "I'd say it's time to start distancing from her. Not punitively, but she seems to see your relationship as functional only with regards to her brother, not as an actual friendship between you two. So it's probably appropriate to consider that when deciding what level of intimacy and closeness you want your friendship to have. Don't invest more in that relationship if it is so conditional.\n\nWhen my aunt and uncle got their divorce, after their kids were grown, my uncle's family actually became/remained closer to my aunt than to their son/brother. My aunt just passed recently and her entire inlaw family is devastated and were all at the memorial. They were active parts of her lives and shared holidays and such. Some of that is because my uncle was, in his sweet, classy Italian mother's words \"an asshole\" in their later marriage and post divorce, but part of it is because they genuinely loved my aunt as a person and as the mother of their grandchildren/nieces. Her mother in law said such beautiful things and was so anguished at the memorial.

Nigel wants to punish his kids because he got divorced. He's not considering that they love their cousins and you. Family doesn't go away because of a court order.

I can see if you'd done something awful, that's fair, but 'it just didn't work out' and you're dead to her?

Don't let him dictate your life.", "When my brother and his first wife divorced, we quickly realised it was the wife who had been making all the effort to keep them all close to the family.  My brother lived with my parents for some months, and my mother essentially looked after the kids one weekend per fortnight, because my brother didn't do as much as he should.\n\nOnce my brother moved out, contact cut right down.  Around this time, I also found out my brother had issues with me.  He's never been able to explain why he doesn't like me.  Some years on, after a lot of effort trying to keep things going, we had a sit down, and I was able to explain away all the things he was angry at me about.  He acknowledged in the end that I hadn't done anything wrong, but still told me he was angry at me.\n\nI pretty much gave up on my brother at that point.  I tried a bit longer, but eventually had to realise that I would never be able to fix things, because the issues were his, and I couldn't do anything about them.\n\nSome time during this whole process, I began organising to see my niece and nephews through the ex, because it was the only way I could ever see them, and my kids were close to them.  Brother wasn't too happy about that, but he never stopped me.\n\nHis kids are grown up now, and I still have some contact with them, but no contact with my brother.  I am sad that myself and my kids aren't as close to their cousins as we could be, but it got difficult to maintain when my brother was being at his most objectionable.

I couldn't imagine cutting out someone you actually loved.\n\nOne of the best Thanksgivings we had was aunts, uncles, SIL, niece, nephew, SIL's new husband (absolute sweetheart) and two bonus nieces.
