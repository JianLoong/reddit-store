About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. \n\nLast weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n\nI thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. \n\nI felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family.

I\u2019m honestly in disbelief you thought you did something wrong. You were incredibly thoughtful in how you handled ensuring she had a meal suitable for her. You have ADHD and are well aware that mistakes are so easily made so to ensure you didn\u2019t seriously put this child\u2019s health in danger, you decided the safest option was to contact a restaurant to provide something. \n\nI can\u2019t stress this enough, YOU ARE NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you accidently made a keto meal wrong, it would upset their diet. It sounds like if you made Becca's meal incorrectly, she could have a major medical issue. You're not wrong for not wanting that stress on you.", "So let me get this straight, your brother called you and A H because you didn\u2019t try to kill his step daughter?! \n\nCross contamination is a real thing! Is he really expecting you to create an elaborate meal for multiple guests, then clean every single inch of your kitchen, possibly buy new utensils, make the meal again adjusted for ALL their requirements and pray that you don\u2019t mess up?!\n\nBetter safe with ordering, than trying to accommodate and end up in the ER!\n\nNTA! You were an extremely generous and thoughtful host. If her allergies are so severe, I can\u2019t imagine why on earth wouldn\u2019t they check with you in advance what\u2019s the plan for dinner! Their entitlement is astonishing\u2026\n\nETA: as many pointed out SIL and brother probably expected OP to cook a gluten/ dairy/ all other allergy free meal for the whole family. Well, enjoy your 5 course water\u2026 As amuse bouche we have Evian. Then for starter Perrier. Main course is San Pellegrino. Dessert will be Fiji. And instead of the cheese course we will enjoy a bit of Nestle. All served in paper cups. Here, problem solved! What a way to celebrate\u2026", "I would flat out say, \"I was worried I would kill her. It's not that I don't care about her; it's that I care about her enough to ensure I don't accidentally harm her.\" You might also point out that allergies are very different from preferences like keto. (Also, usually it's the people with the allergies pointing that out; WTF is going on here?)\n\nIf anyone questions you or gives you shit, use words like \"hospitalize\" or \"kill.\" It may sound dramatic, but those are legitimate fears, and that blunt wording will help get the point across.", "With all of those allergies and conditions that Becca has, Cheryl should\u2019ve been calling you and asking you what she can do to help with this dinner regarding feeding her own daughter. That is certainly what I would\u2019ve done. I have a teenage son who has severe allergies and celiac, as well as IBS. I have never have gone anywhere without discussing what the choices are for his meal and whether or not I should be providing it when we go along. Cheryl is the AH. Your brother is caught up in her behavior and is also the AH. \n\nYour behavior was kind, thoughtful, and generous. NTA.", "NTA. Celiac and dairy allergies are no joke, and while it's certainly possible to make a gluten and dairy free meal in a regularly home kitchen, there's always a possibility of contamination. You did what you thought was safest. They are the AHs for overreacting and making the event all about them, especially when it seems like Becca wasn't bothered.", "NTA\n\nA special diet being a fun challenge is one thing, a severe allergy that could result in a child being ill is another. Your solution was a very good one. I probably would have let them know ahead of time but really that\u2019s a minor thing.\n\nThey are letting their egos get in the way of what is safest for their kid", "Wow. This is a case of \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d coupled with \u201cif you dare break my precious, you are TA forevermore.\u201d You wanted to ensure your guest was served safe foods so you turned to the professionals. How dare you! Stop cooking your five-course meal for 20 people and instead make one single meal that checks all the safety boxes.\n\nNTA, but is your SIL ever one.", "NTA You cooked a five course meal for a bunch of people and out of an abundance of caution bought food for the one person who could suffer if you fucked up! Then one of those people unnecessarily and without really thinking about your effort and your concern took umbrage at that! You are definitely in the clear here.", "NTA. My husband found out last year that he has Celiac, and it has been a challenge to adjust our shopping and cooking habits. We had consultations with a dietician and it is unbelievable the ways that gluten can get into food. Your SIL should be grateful that you took so much consideration for her daughter\u2019s health by assuring that she got a meal free of allergens.", "NTA\n\nI think what you did to get her that meal was amazing and so thoughtful of you. If someone did this for my stepkids, I would be thrilled.\n\nAnyone saying your TA is seriously messed up. The child didn't seem to mind and still got to eat. Plenty of other people wouldn't have done what you did. Brother & SIL sound ungrateful.", "NTA. You DID take into account her dietary restrictions and did your best to ensure that she would have a delicious meal provided to her that would be safe for her to eat. It sounds to me like there's more at issue here than the meal though, just based on the language that was used and some of the details of the story. I don't want to make too many assumptions, but Cheryl sounds like a piece of work.", "NTA. There\u2019s a difference between a preference and a safety requirement. If you made a mistake it could have seriously injured this poor girl. You don\u2019t operate an allergen free kitchen and your brother should be grateful that you ensured a safe, quality meal for her.", "NTA\n\n  \nThis is not a \"ewwww I don't each spinach and i hate mushrooms\" kind of thing, this is a potentially life-threatening thing. People who are this allergic can get a reaction from simple cross-contamination. I would not have risked it either.\n\nYou paid for professionals to provide her a safe and yummy meal.", "Did your brother understand the reason why you ordered her a special meal?  That you were concerned about doing something that might make her sick?  My SIL has food restrictions and I have never heard her say anything but appreciation when others have done something similar for her.", "NTA-it's weird that her parents would rather risk her allergies to get her a homemade meal so that she's eating what everyone else eats instead of her actually getting a special meal so she didn't get sick or you know, die! You were cautious and didn't want to risk it, good on you. and if something were to happen if you made it homemade, they would blame you for it.", "NTA. Do they even like their daughter? You had every good reason not to cook for her. \n\nI don't enjoy cooking, but I can. And I made a great celiac-friendly meal for a couple friends once. I thought I did everything right, but my buddy was still sick at the end of the night. Luckily it was just discomfort, but it could have been worse. \n\nNow I refuse to cook for people who have serious allergies. I will not be responsible for making someone sick. And if that makes me a bad guy, I'll gladly be the villain.", "Ask Greg if he wants a living child eating a takeaway meal prepared safely in an allergen-free kitchen by specialist chefs because his sister was sensible, weighed up the risks and knew it wasn't worth it, or his daughter wheezing and turning blue, trying to use her epipen and potentially ending up in hospital or even dying, because his sister took a risk with his daughter's health? Because that's what it's a choice between.\n\nETA: allergen-free cooking for someone who's life depends on eating safe food is a whole different kettle of fish (no pun intended) to cooking for someone who has voluntarily decided to cut a foodstuff out of their diet.\n\nOP, absolutely NTA. Brother and SIL are TAs.", "NTA. You took her situation into account. You made a special meal for your parents. Knowing that your step niece couldn\u2019t enjoy it, you went out of your way to ensure she had something special just for her.", "NTA, she wasn't going to eat what everyone else was eating, unless everyone ate dairy free, gluten free, etc. This isn't the first or last time she'll be eating a different meal than everyone else.", "NTA How are people so entitled? That was nice of you to pick up something special.", "NTA, but you Brother and SIL are.", "NTA - I know who I wouldn\u2019t be inviting back for dinner ever again though", "NTA - making keto food is for a diet, not something that could risk a life. You were thoughtful and responsible and Becca should feel included since you went out of your way to have her own special meal prepared for her! Whenever I have friends with allergies over for dinner we always order out from a safe restaurant because I would hate for a mistake I made to harm them! You did the right thing", "Considering you would\u2019ve had to deep clean everything in your kitchen to make her food to ensure she wouldn\u2019t have a reaction, i think getting the food from a restaurant was a great idea. Your sister is very entitled to demand you make food after you took time and energy getting safe food for her child.\n\nMost people wouldn\u2019t even do that. There\u2019s so many people that don\u2019t cater to people with allergies or even don\u2019t believe those allergies exist. I think you went above and beyond for this meal. NTA", "Nta. That was so kind and thoughtful of you. It litrally takes a crumb. I'm sure your brother will calm down but he's way out of order.", "NTA. Celiac contamination is really easy to, and the consequences can be really severe really quickly. Making sure she had something safe to eat and know it might be out of your abilities is great self awareness. I think that was a great solution.", "NTA You went out of your way to make sure she had food that was safe to eat.\n\nIf she can go into anaphylaxis from a cooking mistake it's understandable if you didn't want to take the very real risk of her food getting cross-contamination. Even if you cooked the entire meal to the specifications, her food could have been contaminated by residual allergens in your environment.\n\nI think the only thing you could have done to avoid what happened would be to have given your brother a heads up that you were ordering her food from a specialty restaurant because you weren't confident you could cook food that wouldn't make your niece sick.\n\nIt was very bad manners for them to even make an issue of it during the dinner. If they had a problem with what you did they could have addressed it with you privately at some point later.", "NTA You did the most responsible thing possible. It would be incredibly dangerous for you to prepare her food in your kitchen due to the possibility of cross contamination. If you prepared her food with the same utensils that you used to prepare food with gluten and dairy in t you could kill her.", "NTA. As someone with allergies I\u2019d be so happy that someone went out of their way to order a meal for me. Cheryl and your brother sound entitled AF.", "NTA, Becca didn\u2019t care and she seemed to love the food. Which tells me this is your brother and  his wife problem. Adults always want to start something that isn\u2019t that serious.", "NTA. To order safe food was extremely generous of you. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. It sounds like they are actually embarrassed that they talked up your meal without bothering to do their own due diligence and find out how you intended to manage your niece's dietary restrictions. Anger is an easier emotion to feel than shame.\n\nYou did a really nice thing that solved the restriction issue without leaving someone with a bowl of lettuce.", "Wow, far from an AH. I thought your extreme sensitivity to her needs was more than thoughtful. You gave so much thought to her that you did everything you could to ensure she would have a meal that would work for her. I can imagine how many other families would not have done the same. \n\nYou did great. Your brother and his wife forgot that the event wasn't about the food or their daughter, but about celebrating family. \n\nNTA", "NTA - not even a little bit. \n\nBecca's allergies sound serious, and I'm honestly kind of surprised Cheryl would've even been okay with her eating a full cooked meal at your house given that fact. \n\nA friend of mine has kids with similar serious allergies, and she's very protective about what they eat and where since cross-contamination is a real issue for them. \n\nI think you went above and beyond for Becca, and she seemed fine eating it until her mom cast a storm cloud over the whole situation. \n\nCooking for preferential diets (keto, vegan, etc) is an entirely different thing than cooking for allergen diets, and there are SO many things to be cautious of at all times that unless you are specifically skilled in those allergens and how to avoid them, it's best to leave it to the professionals for the most part.", "So you threw a dinner party and took precautions to make sure you didn\u2019t hospitalize one of your guests\u2026\n\nNTA\n\nGreg and Cheryl sure are AHs here because they either lied or don\u2019t care if Becca is hospitalized. Parents of celiacs understand the risks. AHs like to be troublesome to kind people. Don\u2019t sweat it. \n\nI can\u2019t have gluten, don\u2019t have celiac, but still react very poorly. I wouldn\u2019t avoid delicious delicious sourdough for 11 years if that weren\u2019t the case. It sucks being invited to eat but being scared of whether or not sustenance will hospitalize you. You did good. Most folks don\u2019t even bother to try.", "NTA. You bought her a meal. Making a 5 course meal for a bunch of people wasn\u2019t enough so they expect you to make a separate meal for ONE 9 year old? That is just rude.", "NTA. You were responsible and thoughtful and your brother happily let his wife spit in your face for it.\n\nI would give him a serious talking to about how he thinks he can treat you.", "NTA\n\nBecca was fine. SIL made it an issue and made her husband go talk to you. \n\nConsider not making them any of your delicious meals to teach them a lesson \ud83d\ude02\n\nThey could have easily arranged a visit with you for just their family and asked you to cook everyone the same meal (that Becca could eat).\n\nSIL is a crap starter and was looking for an issue. Of course her daughter wouldn\u2019t be eating the same thing as everyone else. Are they implying everything should have been something Becca could eat? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nWhat you did was thoughtful and kind. No risk of cross contamination. They should have thanked you. Talk to your brother one on one of you can. Explain yourself without his wife there. Then mention not cooking for them again (be petty for me) \ud83d\ude02", "NTA and you did the exact right thing! \nIn fact, I, also an ADHDer, did this exact same thing last time I hosted people, I got some awesome vegan tacos from a great little place down the street from us. \nCross contamination is no joke and it is always better to be safe. The parents should have been thrilled that you made the safest choice, especially given the child was happy with her meal.", "NTA! I have severe food allergies and I\u2019d have been truly touched that you thought to do that. Cross contamination is no joke.", "NTA in the slightest.  I\u2019m appalled that your brother and sil were offended by your (very considerate) actions.  My kids grew up with friends who are celiac and the parents always made sure the kids had their own, safe food for birthday parties and such.  \n\nCeliac is serious and I don\u2019t blame you for being anxious.  Ordering from a certified gluten free restaurant was the best and safest option.  \n\nI\u2019m genuinely flabbergasted that anyone would think you were being an AH for being concerned about your niece\u2019s health.", "NTA - It was really smart of you to order out when you were making so many other dishes in your own kitchen - avoiding cross contamination would have been difficult and risky. In a commercial kitchen you can dedicate a space, not so in your own home. They need to see it from this perspective, that you were protecting the kid and being inclusive. If you feel bad you could always make her something special another time when you don't have  a bunch of other dishes in progress.", "people in this comment section don\u2019t realize that people with celiac need completely separate pots, pans, cutting boards, and any other utensils. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you ordered her fast food. You made every effort to ensure everyone had a nice meal to eat and didn\u2019t go into anaphylaxis.", "NTA, those are tough dietary restrictions and it was rude to imply that you should have prepared something homemade. You did not leave her out and were nice enough to order something that she could have.", "NTA - You went out of your way to make sure Becca had a meal she could enjoy that fit her dietary needs! Getting the takeout meal was nice of you.", "NTA.  If anything you went out of your way to accommodate her.", "NTA.  You went out of your way to accommodate (a lot of times people with severe allergies will not want/expect someone else to prepare their food) and did so the safest way you knew possible.  Your brother and his wife should be grateful.  You could have easily said \u201cthat\u2019s too much for me\u201d and let them handle her food, but you still made sure she would be included one way or another.  Also, you already prepared one five course meal, preparing two is a lot for one person!  I think it\u2019s kind of insane that they expected you to prepare two!  And lastly, if you were to have prepared her a meal, whose to say they wouldn\u2019t have trusted it and your efforts would have gone to waste.", "NTA.  It sounds to me like you were very thoughtful in the fact that you wanted to make absolutely sure she would have food that wouldn't make her sick.  I can kind of see where they're coming from, but they need to look at it from your perspective also and realize what you did was for her safety.", "NTA. If the allergy is serious enough that she needs an epi-pen, I'm not taking any chances. Unless you completely cleared your kitchen of all offending ingredients, cross contamination would be very easy in a home kitchen. Like you'd need to remember to wash your hands if you got even the smallest drop of milk on you. \n\nHowever, I would have run your idea past Becca's parents first so that they wouldn't be surprised. Especially as kids can be picky and Becca might have wanted to pick something from the menu herself (sounds like she was happy with the food though).", "NTA at all! She has a severe allergy, I wouldn't have been comfortable either. One imperfectly cleaned bowl and she could've landed in the hospital. And I've got a STRONG feeling they'd have 1. Blamed you and 2. Handed you the hospital bill.", "NTA you were incredibly sweet about this. \u201cI wanted her to be included but I didn\u2019t want to harm the child\u201d is gold star behavior", "NTA  mom of type 1 diabetic.  Not the job of anyone else to manage her diabetes but us.  If your brother or sil didn't call you to discuss you cooking for the neice than their being dramatic and making noise because they like drama.  Don't play into it.", "Before reading, I thought you were gonna say you just didn\u2019t make anything because you couldn\u2019t bother to put in extra effort. But after reading, you went out of your way to make sure she was fed and safe. I say NTA, and if they decide to be offended by you providing a safe meal, they can bring food for her next time.", "NTA! Listen, I have kids with severe food allergies. Do you know how every invitation to anyone\u2019s house starts? With having a conversation about food strategy, and usually me offering to bring something special for my kids, because I do not want to make extra work for the host, AND, number one priority, I want my kids safe! And not just one time, every time, people not living the allergy parent life forget things. Assuming someone else is going to understand how to safely prepare food for a person with allergies, without a conversation, is a recipe for a trip to the ER!  How would the conversation have gone if she had a reaction from cross-contamination? \n\nINFO: what is usually done for Becca\u2019s meals, in the 2+ years she\u2019s been part of the family?", "NTA\n\nI would be worried about cross-contamination going on in a home kitchen when you're making not-safe food at the same time too. You probably should have mentioned it to them in advance, but definitely not the asshole for doing what you did.", "NTA at all.", "Nta I would have told him to duck off and walked away", "NTA, nobody wants to risk making a child sick.", "NTA - I would have straight out told him to shut up and explain why I did what I did.  You did it because you care so much, you wanted to make sure NOTHING was done improperly.", "NTA. I have Celiac and my ultimate fear is having to turn down food when people sweat they made this special thing for me and they were so careful, but I can never \\*Really\\* be sure and I'm a people pleaser and feel like I have to eat it anyway. If someone did this for me, I'd be so grateful", "NTA you went out of your way to get safe food for her. You do not have a dairy and gluten free set up. You could have made her incredibly sick. They are out of line expecting you to risk making her sick, she carries an epi pen for goodness sakes! You could find some recipes give them to her mom to sign off on and go to their house and cook them. Id think since it\u2019s so serious they\u2019d have a gluten and dairy free house.", "NTA, people on keto and vegan diets aren't going to get very sick if you accidentally use the wrong spoon. The stakes were much higher here, especially if you were also making food that was not safe for her in the same kitchen.", "NTA. You don't have a grain free kitchen. You could have made her contaminated food. It would be very bad for her.", "NTA\nWhen my kids were young they had friends with serious food allergies. Their parents would bring their own food from home to ensure it was safe.  What you did was very thoughtful. You seem more worried about the child than her stepfather.", "NTA\n\nYou were scared of cooking something that could potentially and accidentally made her sick, so you got something from an allergic-free restaurant for her, just so she can eat something good and safe. If that's not caring, I don't know what is...\n\nBecca's parents clearly overreacted in that situation. You were trying to do it good. Leaving the party just because you ordered something from outside, so she can be safe (and apparently, that clearly didn't bother Becca, she seemed fine.) is just a major overreaction. They could've let that slide, and talk about it after finishing the meal, at least...\n\nBetter be safe now than sorry later, as everyone says.", "NTA.  You were a thoughtful and gracious host. It isn't your fault if some guests didn't appreciate your efforts. They were very rude.", "Nta. You did include Becca. You got her a nice meal that was safe for her to eat.", "Cheryl started the fight because she wanted to. Your brother has his head so far up her ass, that the toxic smell is keeping him from being rational.\n\nCheryl did not want to come in the first place. Instead appreciating the effort you made she preferred the drama. She found a reason to leave bcoz she didn't want to be there.\n\nNTA", "NTA you went out of you want to accommodate and include her.  While she didn\u2019t eat what you all ate you still thought about her.  Food allergies can be a huge deal.  You thought about her safety.", "NTA. Your brother and his wife are incredibly entitled. You did what was safest for the child and that should matter the most.\n\nEdit to also say that it\u2019s really dumb for parents of a child with such restrictions to not inquiry about food before. Or offer to bring their own. The entitlement is huge!", "NTA If I was the mom and you explained to me it wasn't the effort but the fear of contaminating it and making her sick that was the reason, I actually would have been touched you cared enough to be extra cautious.", "NTA, you were keeping their child safe, and it sounds like you ordered from a very nice place, it\u2019s not like it was some sort of cheap, crappy afterthought. Your brother and SIL are total assholes, as are the people commenting that you are. You were extremely thoughtful and caring.", "NTA, Cheryl and your brother are acting entitled.\n\nIn order to cook for severe allergies, you would have had to make everyone's meal with the same restrictions after fully and deeply cleaning your kitchen and all cooking utensils. This is not an easy task. You went above and beyond to accommodate Becca's needs.\n\nAlso, cooking without Flour and Dairy can be very difficult, both are used in a lot of ingredients and may not be mentioned in them.", "Wow NTA. That would be a hard ask for anyone especially on a special ocassion. They're blowing things out of proportion. You weren't comfortable cooking for her and found a great solution especially since the restaurant specializes in that. They should be thankful you were so thoughtful", "NTA at all. Based on the title I was waiting for something much worse \u2014 you did the completely responsible and accommodating thing. No idea why anyone would be mad about that, especially if it\u2019s so severe an epi-pen has to be carried. I wouldn\u2019t mess with that shit either - like you said, one wrong spoon", "NTA.    There\u2019s gluten in a lot of stuff you might not even think about like even some spices.   And if she needs an epi-pen they should be grateful that you took care of her and didn\u2019t take any chances.   The advice to always assume good intentions instead of bad intentions would be useful for them.  I feel like there\u2019s got be more here under their skin than meets the eye.", "NTA \u2014 if you were worried about making a mistake with the kid\u2019s food, maybe cross-contaminating because or your ADHD, buying hers safe take-out meal was the right choice. Your priority was ensuring the child\u2019s food was safe. This is a case where making a mistake could have been life-threatening for the child. That\u2019s not a challenge. That\u2019s an absolute necessity that her food be totally free from allergens. You don\u2019t mess around with someone\u2019s life. Good choice.", "NTA at all u went out of ur way to accommodate her by ordering from a restaurant. Sil sounds super entitled.", "NTA. Yes you should explain to the brother and his wife, but the person you MOST need to explain to is Becca. Kids are very understanding and it sounds like she was enjoying the meal. The parents' feelings are not the important ones here; Becca should be the focus. Make sure she understands that you got her a separate meal because you wanted her to be able to participate but still be protected because you care about her\n\nI doubt it crossed her mind organically, but she has likely now heard her parents talk about it and may start to believe she was being left out", "NTA. \n\nIt's really hard to accommodate various allergies and if they're as serious as you have been led to believe, this was a perfect solution. Your brother knows you try to accommodate and instead of defending you to his wife or giving you the benefit of the doubt and asking for an explanation, he went immediately with \"you're being mean and singling out this child on purpose.\"", "NTA. I have a lot of allergy friends who take their own food everywhere because hobby cooks and regular people just don\u2019t have the necessary space, tools, and knowledge to avoid cross contamination. It\u2019s literally safer for them to bring their own food. Kinda sorta wondering if they\u2019re exaggerating the risk to Becca, most allergy families would appreciate the extra expense and length you went to to ensure the safety of the allergic person.", "NTA. You accommodated Becca. Also, I too am not comfortable cooking for someone who has celiac as everything has to be cleaned to a microscopic level. I would have done the exact same thing as you. \n\nWhat is funny to me here is that it sounds like the step daughter didn't care and was happy but now that the parents have made a big deal of it she probably now feels like you don't care when that was never the case. What a shame that the parents did that.", "NTA. As someone with a severe allergic you were incredibly considerate. All it takes is one slip up when the entire kitchen hasn\u2019t been cleaned and you were cooking for a large group. Id feel safer eating something from a restaurant dedicated to no cross contamination vs risking it and then possibly dying.", "Um, NTA.  If Becca has such serious food allergies, the BEST way to avoid cross contamination is to completely isolate her food, which you did.  \n\nMy sister eats Kosher, and we've done kosher restaurant takeout for years for her.  Why? Because my sister herself pointed out that kosher restaurants were used to cooking within kosher restrictions and thus, actually, was better than what I made, trying my hardest. (Maybe I suck at cooking but the point remains:)\n\nI can only imagine that a restaurant that specializes in allergen-safe cooking has probably mastered not only allergen safe but delicious.  \n\nYou made her feel included: You served her food, that she could SAFELY eat, at your table. That's included.  If someone went out of their way AND EXPENSE to accommodate my food sensitivity (I can't do dairy) I'd feel incredibly grateful.", "NTA. \n\nI grew up with severe peanut allergies. If my folks and I had showed up at a house and the host was like, \"I made this food you can't eat, but here's some more food i made just for you... in the same kitchen... that I also can't guarantee is safe...\" my family would have just taken me home.", "Omg absolutely NTA! Food allergies are no joke, she could die. I would not feel comfortable being responsible for cooking a meal, knowing accidental cross contamination could lead to serious health issues. You even had meal prepared for her by professionals! Your brother and his wife are AHs and super entitled and clueless.", "NTA. Ungrateful wretches.", "NTA.\n\nSadly an example for \"No good deed goes unpunished\".", "Nta\n\nMy niece has all kinds of dietary restrictions too. They always bring her her own food.\n\nSounds like they think you did it because she's not a bio family member. You should be able to explain that that's not the reason.", "NTA. It was your dinner party where you decide the menu. You\u2019re doing them a service by paying for and providing food for both them and their daughter. I agree with the other comments that say you should\u2019ve told them ahead of time, but they also could\u2019ve asked!", "Nta. Somebody isn't getting invited to the next party.  You went above and beyond, so I wouldn't stress it.", "NTA. Wow, what a reaction to such a kind and thoughtful gesture!\n\nIf you are to be faulted for anything it might be not speaking to her parents first and letting them know ahead of time, but you went so far out of your way to make a special accommodation for Becca, I can't see how they have the nerve to be upset with you.", "NTA. you were ensuring her safety, and having adhd isn't even relevant here -- people can make whatever choices they feel comfortable with to make sure they're doing their due diligence when others' safety is entrusted to them.", "NTA you didn't trust yourself to make the meal, so YOU provided, paid for, and picked up a proper alternative for her.  That was kind and considerate.  Inviting Becca to the dinner is making her feel like part of the family.  Getting her a different meal is accommodating her medical condition so she doesn't get sick.", "NTA!! Out of the top 12 allergies I have 6. I also have epi-pen. I never expect anyone to make me food or buy me food. What you did was amazing, you included her. Plus, allergy friendly food is expensive Maybe, I\u2019m a pessimist I feel like they are setting you up. If you make anything with flour you have to wait at least 24 hours before you could make her anything. You would need different cookware and everything. Your brother and SIL are TA! They also seem entitled.", "NTA.  I'm celiac and we've learned in my family that if its a complicated meal like that - either everyone eats gluten free or I figure out my own meal.  (which unfortunately usually means I'm on my own).  \n\nDid your SIL / Brother consider the issues of cross contamination?  I don't know any home kitchen (even real expensive fancy ones) that has enough (1) counter space, (2) cooking utensils and pots and pans, (3) refrigerator space for ingredients to cook 2 identical five-course meals - one GF and one not.  Plus there's the issue that more advanced/complicated dishes have more ingredients, making it so much easier for problematic ingredients to slip through the cracks (it's wild some of things that contain gluten).  I feel like there's no way cross contamination wouldn't have happened at some point in this meal.  In which case you would have been chewed out for not being more careful.", "NTA but Cheryl is.  Instead of being grateful that you found a gracious solution to Becca\u2019s eating restrictions she decided to bitch and moan about it.  Tell Cheryl next time she can be responsible for providing Becca\u2019s meal.", "NTA, but maybe explain that to them? I wonder if hearing the reason would take the offense away.", "I think you went to a lot of trouble. \nAnd if they were worried about cross contamination like I would be for my kid then they shouldn\u2019t cause a scene. \n\nNTA.\nYou did really well.\nMaybe if anything you should have gave them a call prior to explain that you\u2019re scared.", "NTA.

It isn't just important to have no gluten in the ingredients but alao to have no cross contamination in the preparation. This includes pans, cutting boards, wooden spoons, mixers, etc etc etc. It takes a while for people to get used to how to cook to make sure there is no gluten contamination. If you were using flour, it can stay in the air for 48 hours. You were very thoughtful to make sure there was food she could eat. \n\nNTA", "As someone with severe allergies, I would rather someone buy my meal than prepare me a meal around the items I am allergic to", "Hi, someone who has a friend/roommate who has celiac here\u2026NTA\n\n1. Cross contamination has already occurred in your kitchen. You do not have brand new cookware or prep space.\n\n2. Your decision to accommodate the best way that you can buying from a restaurant that already specializes in allergy food was a good idea. I would however next time consult with the restaurant that their gluten-free area is completely separate from the rest of the food. It takes so little to accidentally contaminate someone with gluten.\n\n3. Gluten is in literally everything you can (and can\u2019t) imagine and you have to somewhat know what you\u2019re looking for. Just because a product says gluten free doesn\u2019t mean that it is. Some items/ingredients are made on a production line that also contains gluten. You could be lucky and get a product/ingredient that hasn\u2019t been contaminated one time but not so much another time. \n\n4. Her mom/stepdad shouldn\u2019t feel comfortable just anyone preparing her food. The poor girl could become very ill and in tremendous pain. I wouldn\u2019t think that would be a risk worth taking.

That girl **knows** she has restrictions and you had a meal especially made for her. Why can that not be a selling point?  It's like they're looking for every opportunity to make her existence be a problem.", "NTA. Watch out for your SIL, the overreaction seems like she\u2019s looking for reasons to alienate him from your family. They just left? No discussion or possibility for solution. That\u2019s what stands out to me the most", "Nta I think it\u2019s thoughtful you order a full meal for her", "NTA, but communication goes a long way, if all parties want to continue a relationship in the future. \n\nThey shouldn't have promised their daughter your cooking without knowing what you'd be making. You did the best you could and took her health conditions to heart.\n\nIf and when things calm down, try to explain it that way, and in the future, always let people know if someone is getting a special meal that you aren't cooking...that way you can also ensure you get something they like!", "NTA x 10000000b!! \nYou took extreme precautions to ensure the safety of a guest! \nThey should have thanked you, not gotten angry! \nTf!", "NTA-you provided good food she could eat and kept her safe.", "NTA\n\nYou made sure she would have enough to eat, that it would be safe for her and you did so at additional expense to yourself.", "NTA You tried to do your best. And if they can't even appreciate it then they are ungrateful. It's already hard to make a five course meal for a whole family single-handedly. But in top of that you made sure to include their daughter's needs by ordering takeout. \nBut did you handle it maturely when they confronted you about it. Which caused them to leave?", "NTA, my mom has celiac and is very strictly gluten-free, people ensuring that there\u2019s something she can eat in situations like this is always appreciated by her.", "Nta, my family has allergies and I'm used to having to pack our own food. I would have been delighted with your thoughtful option.", "NTA. You did EVERYTHING a good host is supposed to do. If they expected you to cook for her that should have been communicated prior.", "NTA **I have celiac disease**\n\nIf a hostess cared enough about my health to recognize they could not safely prepare food for me AND arranged for me to have safe food from a restaurant, I would BEYOND thrilled. Honestly, I\u2019d probably tear up a little bit. It only takes 25ppm (basically a crumb or smaller) to make me **so incredibly sick**. I have ended up in the hospital before from being glutened\u2026it is a frustrating and at times debilitating disease. In addition to being so sick I can\u2019t keep anything down for at least a week, being glutened as a celiac increases my risk for cancer exponentially. Since you enjoy throwing dinner parties, only thing I would advise you to change in the future is to actually contact the person ahead of time and let them know. If you\u2019re graciously offering to provide food from a celiac safe restaurant, ask then what restaurant they prefer.", "NTA. Better than her needing to use her epi-pen over a culinary mishap on your part. But yeah, a heads up would\u2019ve been good.", "NTA, if they were talking up how you were going to be making the special food for her they probably should have checked with you in advance. Not your fault they set up high expectations", "NTA. As a vegan who a lot of times is left out of meals, I\u2019d be ecstatic if someone went to the trouble you did", "Nta. Even very well meaning people can mess up when it comes to cross contamination. Just like you said, a sligthly unwashed spoon or something gets stuck in the fiber of a cutting board. A restaurant who specializes in catering to people with those types of allergies will have their entire kitchens and equipment who has never touched stuff that has those types of foods. If anything, you were taking her condition extremely seriously which shows that you care. The kid was probably just happy that she could eat fancy food and have zero concerns about cross contamination.", " Not the asshole. You did your best considering you also cooked a specialty meal for a bunch of other people. Tell your brother to pull his head out of his ass", "NTA, you did your best and your solution was thoughtful and kind. As someone with food restrictions, I bring my own (I ask first). I never expect someone to make a second or special meal for me.", "NTA at all. My friend with celiac ordered ice cream, and they brought it with a cookie sticking out of the top. Although she knew the danger, she removed the cookie and ate the ice cream. She became severely ill.\n\nYou didn\u2019t want to risk this child\u2019s health, and getting her food was gracious and kind. Frankly, I\u2019m shocked that the parents weren\u2019t grateful. They know about the possibilities of cross contamination. And they know you helped prevent that. You deserve thanks.", "NTA if I had that serious of allergies I\u2019d make sure to bring my own food to insure I have something to eat, I\u2019d never expect for someone to bend over backwards to MY needs. My cousins who is a vegetarian used to bring her own dishes just incase of cross contamination or not having meatless options.", "NTA, home kitchens are not allergen friendly places. Even your spices can have gluten and you'd be surprised at the amount of things with hidden dairy in them. The fact that you found a place that caters specifically to her allergens is great. \n\nIn the future, my only advice is to give people a heads up that they're getting a separate meal instead of surprise catering if you're hosting a dinner. The way you phrased it did make it seem like the whole meal would be friendly and not that you were hosting dinner and buying her food too. It's not often people are willing to cook allergen friendly meals so they're likely just acting out their disappointment in the disclusion without really thinking about how unsafe it is for you to be fucking with an allergy.", "Geezus. Definitely NTA. I feel like what you did was respectful and lovely and I would have been super appreciative if you\u2019d have gone to those lengths to protect her. They were way TF out of line.", "NTA - your accommodations were great.\nI'd normally suggest explaining that you were cooking for a lot of people and it's not that easy to deal with double extra special requirements on top of that. But I really feel like it will fall on deaf ears.\nI'd also suggest trying to make a nice dinner for the four of you that is based on the daughter's dietary restrictions. So you don't have to worry about cross contamination - possibly asking SIL for help in the kitchen to support you/double check all the ingredients as you really don't want to mess up.", "NTA\n\nIf you trust the restaurant I would have done the same. With allergies I don't want to risk unaliving someone. Your brother and SIL clearly don't take this child's allergies seriously.", "NTA\n\nShort of making the entire meal cater to severe allergies, you did the best thing possible.", "NTA. I think the only way you could possibly have handled things better would have been to let them know in advance what the plan for Becca was and why, highlighting that you want her to be safe. You weren't out of line at all. I think it was reasonable to expect a better reaction than you got. I'm sorry this happened to you. It seems like you were paying for every other time Becca has had issues come up with her diet, even though your approach was caring and responsible.", "NTA. Becca would have been eating a different meal anyway, and it was smart of you to leave it to the professionals given the severity of her allergies. If anything it shows how much you care about Becca and want her to be safe.", "NTA\nWhen people are looking to be offended about something they\u2019re usually able to find it. \n\nYou had a perfect solution to the problem that didn\u2019t exclude you step niece in the slightest. Instead of showing gratitude, her mother and step father choose to act like it was some type of punishment? \n\nThey owe you an apology", "NTA - kid seemed fine with it.", "NTA.  It's ridiculous for your brother to think you are going to make a separate meal for one person. You found a suitable resteraunt that prepares food for those with allergies and paid for this meal. You did great in my opinion.", "NTA what a sweet thoughtful thing you did! You took the time to find a restaurant that could accommodate her dangerous food allergies and made the effort to procure an entire meal for her! As the roommate and friend of a person with a deadly dairy allergy I know how difficult this can be and how much effort it can take. You did something kind and they couldn't be bothered to see that.", "NTA. Seems like she didn't mind having a different meal. SIL is the one who was offended.", "NTA. You went out of your way to accomodate Becca to ensure she wasn\u2019t affected", "Above all else you fed her something SAFE and that\u2019s the most important thing. If you made her food and accidentally cross contaminated she could be very sick or in critical condition. If her parents can\u2019t see why that might make any normal person uncomfortable and nervous, they have no grip on reality. NTA - you didn\u2019t think you could safely prepare food for her and went above and beyond to accommodate her dietary needs by getting her another meal", "NTA - they\u2019d really been pissed if they\u2019d had to take that kid to the hospital.", "NTA. If you messed up, you'd be the one responsible for her sickness/death, and if they can't understand that you don't want that sort of responsibility, then I say good riddance.\n\nETA: Maybe you could've told them that, but I don't think that makes you an AH.", "NTA. \n\nYou tried your best to accommodate her without risking her getting sick. \n\nMaking something vegan or keto is not the same as making something that is completely gluten and dairy free. You don\u2019t need to clean and essentially sterilize the bowls, pots, pans etc in the same way for vegan or a diet dish that you do for when someone could become seriously ill and well, die if there is cross contamination.", "NTA. You provided an equally beautiful meal to everyone and their requirements.", "NTA\n\nBetter safer than sorry.", "NTA. You did a great job of making her feel welcome by making sure there was yummy, *safe* food for her to eat. They are the ones making her an outcast by just up and leaving because they weren't happy with how you handled it. In fact, at 9 I'm betting she's already well used to eating different foods than others and while I'm sure she does sometimes wish she could eat other stuff, so does everyone who has food allergies. \n\nYou should bring up with them that you just wanted to be extra sure not to cross contaminate and put their daughter in danger but that you're sorry they aren't as concerned with the matter as you are.", "NTA. They are guests in your home.  You provided a lovely meal that accommodated your guest with special dietary needs.  Your guests don't get to dictate how you provide the meal.  TF.", "NTA as you were only doing your best to make sure that Becca didn\u2019t get seriously sick", "NTA. You could\u2019ve done nothing at all. After all that\u2019s Cheryl\u2019s kid & her responsibility not yours. They SHOUID be thankful you thought of her issues at all", "NTA, your brother and SIL are", "Nta they are being totally unreasonable - she has an epi pen ! Getting a meal from specialist firm  who will have clean kitchens  and processes to avoid cross contamination is a lovely way to deal with it. And much safer than her eating things prepared in an ordinary kitchen were items containing her allergy triggers are present.", "NTA, you provided her with a full meal of stuff she could eat. YWBTA if you left her with nothing whilst everyone else ate", "NTA. Given how serious her allergies are, I wouldn\u2019t feel confident cooking for her either. I\u2019d be terrified of sending her to the hospital", "NTA, if you had cooked using wheat flour, any particles that made its way to the celiac friendly meal would have contaminated it. This was the safest and smartest option for someone who has such severe restrictions. Unless the whole kitchen is entirely wheat free it can be hard to keep residue out of the food, with flour particles being able to hang in the air for quite some time. I think this was a really good solution to the issue outside of having the kid eat nothing but salad for dinner.", "NTA you went out of you way. I have a food allergy and would never expect anyone to do this. Also it's very tricky to cook for allergies, it's taken me a long time figure out all the ingredients and hidden allergens. You did nothing wrong. Your brother and his family are entitled geeks, don't invite them to eat your awesome food", "NTA I think that was very thoughtful of you and I don't even understand why Cheryl would be upset. I know someone with a gluten sensitivity whose stomach will get upset if something is cut on a board that also came in contact with gluten so going the professional route seems logical to me. Just can't please some people.", "Omg so much NTA.  You probably spent a lot more money on Becca\u2019s plate than the rest of your guests and went to a place where you knew it would be prepared in a way safe for her. It\u2019s hard to prevent cross contamination in a home kitchen especially when you are preparing other food.", "NTA. Being confident in accommodating non threatening, by-choice diets and not taking a risk when there's a risk of severe health problems cannot be compared at all.\n\nIt is in fact very thoughtful to seek out a restaurant specializing in foods that you can serve to Becca. If anything, it is quite inclusive and accommodating to your guest and a new family member.\n\nConsidering she will be in countless situations where she will inevitably have to eat differently than the rest of the party she's with, I don't think Greg and Cheryl's reactions are going to help her in the future.\n\nPerhaps you could offer to cook something for her in the future where you will feel more comfortable to make it safe for her (when you're also not preparing the host a good number of people). However I wouldn't blame you not to think about offering that if Greg's reaction was that poor in the first place.", "NTA. She will probably have this happen several times throughout her life, too. If you're not dairy and gluten free at home normally, it's EXTREMELY difficult to convert over, and I have ADHD as well and understand exactly why it makes you nervous to even think about cooking for Becca. I'd be super happy my kid's safety was thought of to begin with!", "NTA! Your kitchen would be a cross contamination nightmare for severe allergies. You did the good and safe thing. Your brother and his wife are the a-holes here.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t exclude her and made a special effort to provide a nice meal for her to eat within her dietary guidelines. The alternative would be to not invite her and her family, but you included them. I think brother\u2019s wife wanted to make a fuss on purpose.", "Absolutely NTA. I mean, they made wild assumptions about your motivations then left without giving you a chance to explain you were just looking out. Fuck em.", "NTA, you did make her feel included by ensuring she had a full meal the same size as everyone else. She\u2019s 9 and perfectly capable of understanding why you bought her meal vrs making it, if she actually had a problem with it, which it doesn\u2019t appear she did. It\u2019s not like you asked her parents for pay for the meal either, or anything else. You took it upon yourself to make sure she had what she needed to be a part of the dinner and not at risk. I\u2019m sure if you had made an entire meal based off of her dietary restrictions other people would have maybe had a problem with it, but again with something as deadly as her allergies it was better to be safe anyways", "WTF? NTA.. I was expecting that you were going to say, sorry, have a can of tuna or something. I think you went out of the way as it was and having cooked quite a bit I know how time consuming it can be. I try to accommodate but usually that's dealing with taste preferences, not life or death. You are NOT TA", "NTA sounds like you were  just trying to be super safe with her dietary restrictions and allergies. Fed is best and you went out of your way for them.", "Nta as someone who has several food allergies I would have been thrilled by the effort you put in.

My dad has celiac and it\u2019s HARD. Gluten migrates. Cross contamination takes a lot of getting used to. And I have adhd and I get it. I do y cook any poultry because I don\u2019t trust my adhd brain to get the kitchen clean. She\u2019s discounting your disability too. You did your best. You can experiment when it\u2019s just them and you all cook together, but that was probably not the moment.", "NTA. Show your brother and SIL what everyone is saying. They all make excellent points and since none of them know you, they\u2019re not taking your side because of any feelings for you.

Maybe SIL is really jealous that you didn\u2019t have everything catered!", "NTA\nAs someone with celiacs disease I would be extremely appreciative of this. My grandmother shows her love with food, has tried to cook safely for me many times, however I get sick everytime. The only way to completely avoid cross contamination in a home kitchen is to have a completely gluten free kitchen. Imagine you made a mistake and glutened her, that would have been much worse.", "NTA. They\u2019re TA. It wasn\u2019t malicious and you took it upon yourself to accommodate her safely. What pisses me off the most about this is that if OP had tried and failed or been careless and the little girl had a reaction they would have still been on her case. She has severe food allergies so she won\u2019t always fit in at big dinners and her parents should be preparing her for that reality instead of doing this", "Sounds like Becca\u2019s parents need more education about celiac disease. Most celiacs I know wouldn\u2019t eat a meal prepared in the same kitchen with a gluten meal because cross contamination is so serious. You did an incredibly thoughtful thing researching restaurants and finding safe food for her and Greg and Cheryl were complete jerks and bad parents to boot. NTA at all.", "NTA at all, you for sure went above and beyond to ensure Becca had a good meal. The only thing might have been to mention in advance to Greg what your plan was so there were no surprises. But of course hindsight is 20/20 and you had no idea they would react that way.", "NTA. You provided a lovely alternative. Tell your brother to quit simping.", "NTA - you have good reason not to make the food; cross contamination is no joke for those with allergies.", "NTA Allergies like that need extra attention, I think ordering her something that was still \u201cspecial\u201d was a very equitable solution.", "NTA cooking a five course is a big feat, cooking two versions of five courses is big feat for a professional and doing that with this level of cross contamination risk an easy no-go. Not providing would have been assholey, but you had the wee one professionally catered.\n\nYour brother and his wife were major assholes in making a number out of this", "NTA! As someone with an anaphylactic food allergy I am simply overjoyed when someone thinks of me the way you did (either alternative dessert, something I know is 100% safe, an extra side dish etc.).\n\nI use to bring my own desserts to birthday parties with me simply because we didn't know if I could eat the cake, etc. Its the reality when you have severe food allergies unfortunately.", " NTA. Better this than a trip to the hospital.", "NTA. This is a brilliant solution to a serious challenge. I'd be deeply appreciative if someone took this extra care to handle my dietary needs.", "Celiac weighing in here: based on all the times someone has gone out of their way to prepare something just for me and then poisoned me anyway because of crumbs in the butter or gluten transfer from the salt shaker, you are NTA and your brother has no idea what he's talking about", "NTA Greg and Cheryl can STFU. Someone else went to the trouble of providing free dinner to them and the girl. Ingrates. Best not to invite them for food anymore.", "Entitlement strikes again! NTA", "NTA. There's a world of difference between allergic, and epi pen allergic. You can't know the threshold. \n\nI liked someone else's idea of cooking at their house after explaining why you did it the way you did. But Becca has got to learn, early, that because of her severe food allergies, she's going to be very limited in where she can go to get food. \n\nAdditionally, one thing you might do is to prepare everything of Becca's FIRST, before anything else. That way you can take something you know is clean from the dishwasher and untainted. That would be very sweet of you, but your brothers expectation is obnoxious. \n\nTo reiterate: NTA", "NTA, It is really always the parents who make a problem of things that children themselves think is fine.", "NTA - if she needs an epi pen then she is deathly allergic. It\u2019s not just a random diet plan someone chose and doesn\u2019t have to worry about cross contamination. You were being safe, found her an alternative meal she could safely enjoy and usually places like that aren\u2019t very cheap either. You did everything right and SIL should feel happy that you care about her daughter like that and her safety.", "NTA.  You literally ordered a special meal for their daughter in order to make sure she had a good and safe meal.   You went above and beyond to make sure her food was safe buying from a specialty restaurant.   I imagine that was far from a fast food restaurant.  Seeing as how most cheap restaurants I've been through can't even remember to omit one thing.  Your brother and his wife are being unreasonable and  not doing their daughter any favors trying to defend her when they have no reason to defend her.  \n\nIf the many stories I've seen involving severe dietary restrictions are any indication of life with allergies she is likely going to come across many times in her life where she will need to bring her own food.  Either due to people not going out of the way to have a meal for her.  Or because someone can't understand how little of a trace of her nope foods it can take to cause pain.", "NTA, if it was a simple one dish dinner then maybe, but it was multiple courses which means more time, dishes, utensils and multi-tasking. I would love for someone to think of my child and ensure her safety than just ignoring her issues or risking a cross contamination.", "NTA.

Please don\u2019t feel guilty for anything!", "My daughter has severe food restrictions. No one in our extended family ever accommodates her as nicely as you did for Becca. I'm going with NTA.

You took extra precautions to ensure Becca's well-being. That's generous of you", "NTA \n\nA friend of mine has a 5yo son with severe allergies. They will only give him food that they prepared at home when they go to someone\u2019s house for a get-together. They bring their own plate and utensils as well. This way they know for absolute certainty that the food wasn\u2019t contaminated, but also because they don\u2019t want someone who is not as familiar with the severity of it to feel responsible if they accidentally use a pot or utensil that has traces of the allergens on it and he goes into shock. There are so many things people who don\u2019t encounter this on a regular basis wouldn\u2019t think of when preparing the food. \n\nThose parents should not be so indifferent to what their child is eating.

About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. \n\nLast weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n\nI thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. \n\nI felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.  Absolutely.  But if you haven't had a chance to explain, I'd suggest you do it ASAP.  If they can't accept it, then they have to do an attitude adjust.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA. You do not get to stress people about allergies, and then get upset when they do their best to not expose you to those allergens. It sounds like the mom just wanted a fight.", "NTA I'd say you deserve a medal for trying to accommodate her in the safest way you could think of. And she wasn't even mad, your brother was. Why didn't he volunteer to cook a safe meal that everyone could enjoy?", "NTA.\n\nYou are aware of your limitations and drew a line when it comes to a child\u2019s health.\n\nThe only improvement I can think of is you could have spoken with your brother before the meal, so it was not a surprise for them.", "She's 9... her mum could've just told her some BS story about how it's a special meal for her made by you and she wouldn't be any wiser... you made every effort you can to accomodate the kid... you feld unsafe making food for her... as a parent if you start feeling that way and my kid has severe food allergies i'd agree please don't cook for my kid...\n\nthe only one who excluded her was her mother... you literally went through extra hoops for the kid... no need to feel bad you did great and i bet the food was delicious!\n\nNTA", "Sooooo NTA!!!!! You\u2019re so kind and considerate!!", "NTA.", "Five courses cooked by a person with ADHD and hosting a child with potentially deadly allergies in a kitchen not set up for those restrictions. Holy crap, if that was my kid and you ordered in to make her safe I'd have kissed you.\n\nNTA\n\nShe was a guest, not the guest of honor. Now if the party was for her that would have been not cool as all the dishes should be something she could eat.", "NtA\n\nYou took a precautionary measure to make sure she had safe food to eat due to the severity of her allergies. Your bro and sil's reaction was over the top, especially since the stepdaughter clearly didn't have an issue with the meal (I'm sure due to her allergies she's probably use to eating something different than what the people around her are eating) \n\nBro and Sil are the assholes in this situation", "NTA. Your brother is being ridiculous. Making a separate menu for one person is bad enough but with her allergies take out was a great option. Becca will be eating different things from everyone else for the rest of her life. My nephew is deathly allergic to cashews and dairy. He\u2019s 3 yet he knows some foods are not good for him. My sil does not expect us to make separate food for him. You were very considerate.", "NTA!\n\nMost people\u2019s don\u2019t know how hard dietary restrictions can be to accommodate for the severely allergic. \n\nMy friend cannot have preshredded cheese or frozen veggie blends because it\u2019s often coated in cornstarch and she\u2019s allergic. Most people would just see she is allergic to corn and assume since the labels don\u2019t say corn there isn\u2019t a problem.  This would be HOW she found out there was a problem!\n\nAnother friend cannot have any gluten - which means no American Soy Sauce because there\u2019s wheat in most brands!", "NTA. I think your compromise was very thoughtful and went above and beyond what you needed to do. Your brother is 100% in the wrong for throwing a fit. I do, however, think it would be nice for you to host a similar dinner party with all the family but prepare a homemade meal that Becca can enjoy. Your brother's over reaction was out of line, but if by some chance Becca did feel a little left out it would be nice to show her she is definitely thought of/ included. I hope your brother apologizes to you as well.", "NTA but you should have mentioned it to them prior what you were doing and why you were doing it", "NTA - would it have been nice if you could have made her something special ?  Yes of course and maybe you could plan something specific for her still as a gesture of your love for her.  But speaking as someone with food sensitivities and issues you absolutely did the right thing in this instance.  Much better to be safe than sorry.  Plus frankly if this is her situation she absolutely used to it being an issue by now and probably appreciated not only that you thought to do something to accommodate her, but that it was also a worry free solution. Your focus was scattered and you had enough on your plate (fun pun) with having to cook so many other dishes as to prevent you from being able to give it the attention it required.  I say do a special meal for her another time.  Invite them over and serve them all the same special meal.  You are not a short order cook and good on you for knowing your limitations and for being cautious.  As a limited eater I personally would prefer your solution over worrying what you might have accidentally cross contaminated my meal with and over you making a big fuss over me.  It gets so old and embarrassing having a fuss made at every meal.  I\u2019m fine I\u2019m completely used to it, I can make do with a side dish or plain salad that is my normal.  It\u2019s everyone else butting in and making a big to do about it (her well meaning parents) that is annoying and make you feel singled out as an oddity.", "NTA, pretty entitled reaction of your brother and his wife. I would send them a text explaining you didn't want to risk getting the kid getting sick and that you carefully chose that food. I would also add that's it's ridiculous to blow this out of proportion and make such a huge stink. The girl is 9 ffs. As long as she liked it and didnt have an issue, what's the problem?", "I was leaning NAH - but I think it was actually over-the-top for them to leave, so I'm going NTA as Greg overreacted. \n\nBut I do think your reputation as an advanced-level cook complicates things a bit. It really does sound like there was genuine excitement to eat YOUR food. And at the same time -- all of your concerns were reasonable. Now that you know their desire to eat YOUR food - maybe you invite them for a do-over and explain the genuine misunderstanding?", "Another perfect example of everyone believing they should be accommodated. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s responsibility to accommodate other specific needs in their own home. Honestly you went far and above what you needed to. I\u2019m my humble opinion when people are coming over for dinner they can eat what I prepare or they can bring their own\u2026.. no skin off my back.", "NTA!", "You did the responsible thing by outsourcing to people who make the kind of food that's safe of Becca as their profession. And it's not like you gave her something slapdash and insulting. Becca herself didn't seem to feel left out, that was purely Cheryl making trouble. Apparently she cares more about profiling than the strong possibility of her daughter ending up with a life threatening allergic reaction if you had cooked her meal yourself. NTA", "NTA. I am curious as to why they didn't reach out beforehand to make arrangements for Becca.\nI have made the habit of taking food I made at dinners and telling the host beforehand \"please don't worry about accomodating me, I am happy to enjoy your company\".

Here\u2019s a reality check for your brother. I use SEPARATE PANS for my food than my family does for their regular foods because gluten can get caught behind screws and in crevices of pans and I could easily get sick.y doctor clued me in to that.

As someone with 2 serious food allergies (one of which is celiac), I often prefer to bring my own food that I know is safe.

But in the future, I\u2019d say make it all safe since people with these allergies are more often than not left out or have to bring their own food (there\u2019s the Indian-South African influencer with a crap ton of allergies and she always ends up bringing her own food), which makes dinner events suck emotionally. And it\u2019s not your fault your brother hyped you up without actually talking to you about the meal. I\u2019m gonna be real- if my kid had major allergies and we were going to a dinner, I\u2019d be messaging and communicating with the host a lot about it.", "Not necessarily TA, but yeah you could\u2019ve talked to your brother first to find a solution.", "NAH I think your reasons were really good ones, but without explanation, I could see how it could be seen as a slight. \n\nI would just send them a follow up message explaining your reasoning and maybe just apologize for unintentionally making them feel uncomfortable, just in case the daughter shared her mothers offense.

They expected that you'd cook for everyone, and you got takeout for the girl instead. I can see how it might affect the child, but in your situation it seems like it was okay, luckily.

As a chef myself, I commend you for taking so many precautions and prioritizing this girls safety. Cooking for people with serious allergies is TERRIFYING. I personally don\u2019t think you should eat at normal restaurants if you have a life threatening allergy to an ingredient used there because the tiniest mistake can have the biggest consequence. I can\u2019t tell you how many times in restaurants I\u2019ve worked at the kitchen crew has had to fully sanitize the whole kitchen for gluten and shellfish allergies and despite that sanitation, all the cooks are on edge because a microscopic missed spot on the counter could be fatal to a guest. It\u2019s too much responsibility to place on overworked, underpaid cooks and you recognize that it\u2019s a responsibility you don\u2019t feel comfortable with either, very understandably. Big kudos to you.\n\nIn the future, definitely clarify your intentions with your brother and SIL but truly, I don\u2019t think they should be mad at you at all.

It has honestly been a bit of a struggle connecting with Cheryl for all of us. We keep trying because we love my brother, but it's hard. We all got off on the wrong foot because Cheryl was Greg's boss when they met and that coupled with the age difference made my mom feel like Cheryl was taking advantage of him (and I didn't entirely disagree). So there's some history there, and this was just another issue to add to the pile.", "This. OP please dish", "Most parents of kids with severe dietary allergies would be grateful that the cook had removed the risk of cross-contamination, not mad that OP hadn't cooked two entirely separate five course meals without possible cross-contaminating two very common food ingredients.", "This is basically what I was going to write. \n\nOP, you are NTA, but the optics are bad. \n\nYou needed to let your brother know that with the size/complexity of the meal you were making, you had concerns about keeping Becca safe and were planning on ordering her a meal so there was no chance of cross contamination.

Like, if someone just preferred not to eat wheat or dairy, I wouldn't mind accommodating that for a dinner. My concern really was with cross-contamination.

It's also nerve wracking when you're not in a professional kitchen, where they can control things more readily than a home cook can. I appreciate where your brother and SIL are coming from in that everyone wants a special meal when you're a good cook, but they're asking too much. Planning and preparing  a whole special meal for a large group is a herculean task. Doing all of that and THEN trying to manage a separate meal for allergens is impossible for one person. Suggest your brother, SIL, and her daughter come over for a special meal that caters to her and let her help plan the menu.

I have a similar situation in my family and we usually discuss beforehand if there are enough safe things the host of the get together is making for the family member or if they should bring their own food.", "Exactly!  Unless you have professional training, you can screw up and not even realize it.  I really don\u2019t understand the logic of the parents.", "THIS.

This is nothing like the AITA mashed potatoes debacle.", "You could ask your brother if he would have preferred you made the meal just the same for everybody, like Beca\u2019s food because eating keto and cross contaminate keto is not the same as cross contaminate for Beca because it can cause her a serious illness, even to die of food poisoning", "Right, I really don't understand their objections here--I think it's going above and beyond that the OP made sure her food was prepared in a safe kitchen even if she spent extra money on it. Other than they hyped Becca up for this meal.", "That's a really nice idea.", "It's also your job as a parent to temper your child's expectations in the face of their own limitations. \n\nWhy would they (a) assume that OP could make the food that their child required and (b) spend days hyping up said child when they haven't even confirmed that there's something there that she can eat? \n\nThey set her and themselves up for disappointment.", "And offer to bring something ourselves (I do it even for my kid with sensory issues).

That way you could vet all the ingredients and spend some time with Becca that could actually be really special and fun.", "Did they expect you to make a 5 course celebration dinner with no dairy or gluten? Or a second complete meal? I would invite them for a simple one dish meal once in a while, but couldn't imagine having to cook like that all the time. So glad I don't have to. We only have to leave out nuts in my household.", "At no point did I lay any fault on OP. I said I was between NAH and ultimately landed on NTA because of Greg's dramatic storm out. \n\nMy suggestion is merely if she values these relationships and wants to mend the fence, which she is obviously not obligated to do, I think it would be fairly easy to explain away this misunderstanding.", "Yeah, I agree with that. If you invite someone you already know has an allergy to certain foods, it\u2019s pretty much a given that you are accommodating them, I at least think it would be a dick move not to. That aside, I don\u2019t know what else could\u2019ve OP done in this situation.

You'd have to deep clean any appliance also to be safe, shared toasters are dangerous and if you have say a convection oven, that'd be a possible source of contamination too.

I'm too sensitive, and the risk is too great to put the onus of serving me on someone else. It sounds like the meal was complex enough to make for people who do not have dietary restrictions, and I think it's a bit entitled of someone to expect their child's anaphylactic allergies to be accommodated by someone who is not intimately familiar with the child's needs, although OP is clearly knowledgeable about food allergies. I don't expect a normal restaurant to accommodate my needs, because it's dangerous for me if they mess up, but it's a real treat to eat at a dedicated gluten free restaurant.

She tells us all the things she did to make sure it's safe for us. I will never have the heart to tell her I always leave in discomfort. Gluten gets everywhere!", "I know a kid who asked 'will this kill me?' when given packaged food, before he could read. He has a peanut allergy.", "They married 2 years ago when he was 23.  Wonder how old he was when they first got together?  You definitely weren't the only one to notice.", "My guess is they're insecure about their acceptance into the family.", "I was thinking they would no longer invite the parents. I'd rather invite Becca and arrange for someone else to drive her (being petty)", "Oh gosh. This makes way more sense now. You did nothing wrong. NTA.", "Oh *GOD* no!!!", "EWWWW holy shit. That is so predatory.", "Good god. I have a 28yo son who is not marriage potential currently - at 23? LOL I can't imagine what any woman with a child would have even seen in him - *and I'm his mother*; I think he's the bestest thing ever made, by default. \n\nI mean, I can't judge marrying young, but it definitely hits different when you're BOTH virtual children. (Also, hard lessons learned there, for sure.)", "Yes. This red flag dynamic kinda makes me wonder if Cheryl is looking for ways to alienate Greg from his family. OP was NTA in every way, and Cheryl still found a way to pitch a fit.", "Total power move by the sister. Instead of speaking up, she throws a fit and has her husband \"go be the man and talk to your sister about this\".  So gross.", "Not only are Becca's parents at fault for being upset, they're at fault for ruining someone else's special evening. They totally made this about them by leaving in the middle of the party because of some perceived slight against them. In my opinion that's hugely inconsiderate of the fact that they are there to celebrate someone else's special day. I guess the parent's anniversary wasn't all that important after all.", "Thank you. That's really sweet.", "Not to mention it seems they learnt about Becca's menu when the food was already on her plate. What if OP forgot about her condition? What if she made a mistake? Didn't they think about this beforehand? As a vegetarian, every single time I eat with someone else, I ask what can I bring and never expect to be served because they don't need to know what can I eat and what I like, among those things. Taking for granted she did everything ok without checking is kinda dangerous.", "Yeah, I\u2019d be terrified to cook for a celiac.  Not only does just a tiny bit of gluten set it off, but each attack does irreparable damage.  I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t insist on bringing her food from home honestly!", "Better yet, plan to cook a meal at their house just for the daughter - where you don\u2019t have to worry about being the cause of cross contamination", "And you'd have to research each ingredient - even single ingredient items like rice, lentils, spices - that you bought to ensure they were gluten free. I have celiac and I can only use a couple of brands of spices, for example, because cross-contamination during production is a problem with most brands.", "I honestly would never cook food for someone that has all of those intolerances because I wouldn't trust myself to not accidentally make a mistake and contaminate the food without knowing it. OP shouldn't ever feel like they did something wrong since that took thought to do.", "If the parents demand this level of respect for their child's health concerns, that five complicated courses be suitable to her, then they should be able to respect OPs ADHD. Its not the child's fault for her health, and she should never feel bad about it. The meal in general should be made with her in mind, and it was. OP tried very hard to make a overly nice meal for everyone and guests still found a way to complain about a meal that could have costed $150+(?) at a nice restaurant. They obviously don't know the lengths of effort, time, and energy it takes to cook at this level.\n\nI've made various Creme Brulee's with varying flavors like French Toast and Apple Cinnamon for my roommates, and they complained that they weren't vegan. Even though they aren't vegan.\n\nYou are so NTA OP. Show everyone this thread as proof. I wish I could try what you made.", "Especially to dairy, I wouldn\u2019t say that I eat an unusual amount of dairy but thinking about it now I\u2019m sure my entire kitchen is probably contaminated with it. With the celiac on top of that basically everyone\u2019s home kitchen is going to be a risk to her.\n\n Even just imagining the stress of cooking for her is stressing me out, because like OP I don\u2019t think I would be equipped to ensure her safety. NTA.", "Plus, I am sure the scene embarrassed Becca, who probably feels they had to leave the party, because of her. Becca was happy with the food, OP was careful to keep her safe.", "Exactly! And even up to the point of him talking to her in the kitchen immediately, I thought it should have been fine. People get offended when they don't understand and THAT'S FINE... Up until that exact point, I thought there were no AH's at all. \n\nBut then comes the sentence that states that Greg, Cherry  and Becca were leaving because of this thing --> This Truly Incredible Thing <-- that OP did for her step-niece, out of fear for the kid's health. That is called caring enough to let someone specialised handle it...\n\n This IS what loving and caring actually looks like...\n\nAnd when brother went to talk to OP, and she explained, that should have been the end of it. He should have understood, agreed with and thanked his sister. For caring enough to go through such lengths especially for Becca. \n\nIt's not like OP went to the supermarket and bought some microwaved dishes for the kid. A nice restaurant meal is not inexpensive to begin with. To add that to the costs of hosting a whole family for dinner would have increased on the costs greatly. But does anyone hear OP complain about this? \n\n And since your brother couldn't bother to say it, I'll say it to you \u2764\ufe0f thank you for loving the kid enough to worry about her health, and going out of your way to fix her a meal she could safely enjoy!\n\nOP you are too good for this world.\n\nNTA", "My friend literally almost died. She was wasting away and her doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong. She was down to skin and bones before she was finally diagnosed. If an extra couple hours of cleaning means she can enjoy eating without worry, I\u2019m happy to do it.", "My nephews have a tree nut allergy and one has gotten so worried about being exposed he had a melt down at Christmas when he saw the pecan pie I made for the family get together. \n\nWhat was sad is that I do not make that pie if I know the nephews will be at a dinner - and they were not expected at this one. Otherwise I would have made something without nuts or gluten (since they are also sensitive to gluten). Usually I make meringue cookies since they can have those.", "Petty is not the word for Cheryl. I am wondering how long it will take her husband to give up on her being, you know, nice to people. He has a lot of years left to lie to himself about her.", "Yup, if they do this to family imagine what they do to Becca\u2019s friends growing up\u2026 she won\u2019t have many sleepovers or play dates or anything like that.", "**Cheryl** is the AH. 100%.", "Same.  It's straight up hard to watch a 5 year old ask about something because they know it will kill them.", "Agreed.", "I think the mother uses this as her whole identity! Maybe it's some kind of power play that she wanted the entire meal for everybody to be safe for Becca? Almost like a control thing?", "Amen to everything you said.", "This!! It feels like a setup. SIL didn't contact OP about what would be available for Becca to eat. It seems like she wanted a gotcha moment of \"you made this mistake and almost KILLED MY DAUGHTER!\". She wasn't expecting a professionally prepared meal and had to quickly create alternative drama.\n\nOp, you're NTA. Keep an eye on that SIL.", "I was shocked by that too!", "Honestly this makes me wonder if Cheryl was deliberately looking for a bone to pick. Or if the story is fake.\n\nThe way everyone in this thread describes it, I find it very hard to believe that anyone who actually has a 9 year old celiac at home would fail to realize how much work it requires in the kitchen. Or that they'd even particularly *want* to entrust their daughter's safety to a \"layman\", without even reaching out first to explain cross-contamination and make sure she knows just rinsing the utensils off *isn't* sufficient. This sounds like the sort of thing that parents are control freaks about by necessity... and yet these not only aren't, it didn't even occur to them to discuss it beforehand? I find that odd.", "> now she would feel left out because **she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating**.\n\nNah see, they expected OP to make gourmet, completely gluten and dairy free meal for *everyone*.  Including recipes that OP has no particular experience in cooking (depends on what the menu was of course), in a kitchen that would have had to have been completely scrubbed top to bottom, including replacing all ingredients that might conceivably have been cross contaminated at some point in the past.\n\nAnd I get the feeling that SiL would be the type to let her child eat supposedly safe food someone else had prepared without triple checking that it really was safe (no hidden gluten / dairy, no possibility of cross contamination), and then go off at the host when the inevitable happened.", "Especially easy with celiac! All it takes is a spoon that wasn't thoroughly washed or some flour residue in the air and they result is a life threatening, extremely painful reaction that can cause permanent harm. NTA OP.", "Not the same at all, but my cousin is vegan (ethical, not medical) and this past holiday season my husband and I wanted to bring a full vegan item to the potluck so it wasn't just her and my aunt making stuff she could eat. I sent her pictures of a couple of ingredient lists on boxes just to make absolutely sure I wasn't missing anything since I'm not vegan and there are animal products in some crazy places. She was very appreciative of even just the effort.\n\nSevere allergies to items that are found in SO MANY FOOD ITEMS that could potentially send a 9yo to the hospital or worse? Oh hell no, I don't feel comfortable taking that risk. The restaurant meal for Becca was a wonderful, safe compromise.", ">ex-kid\n\nThis made my day \ud83d\ude02", ">Sounds like that mommy likes attention and drama so she uses her daughter as an excuse to be outraged and Greg is sucking up to it instead of expecting her to respect normal social boundaries.\n\nSounds like Mommy is trying to isolate Greg from his family.\n\nTo make this kind of a stink about a true act of kindness towards her daughter, flip it around and try to make it nefarious... it takes a special kind of abusive person to pull that off. \n\nHard NTA but your brother is and your SIL is a massive one.", "Right, it's not like they were like okay, here's your boiled chicken that still might have cross contamination if I got distracted. He got her a multi course meal like them.\n\n\nThe consequences of keto/vegan meals getting messed up is basically zero compared to the consequences of anaphylaxis and celiac reactions.\n\nNTA", "I already did not feel like I like her and now I know I don't like her.", "Nine year age gap. He'll grow out of dealing with her bullshit most likely.\n\nNTA, OP.", "FWIW, there IS a sort of allergy/synthetic peanut butter that is really close to Reese's filling.

Celiac is different from an allergy because it\u2019s an autoimmune reaction to gluten. Gluten is a protein, and it can\u2019t be \u201cwashed off\u201d of something with some soap & a sponge. People with celiac usually have a completely separate set of cooking pans, utensils, cups/plates/bowls, storage containers, you name it, because of how difficult it is. If a family member cooks gluten in a dedicated gluten-free pan, it\u2019s recommended to just toss it and get a new one. And porous wooden spatulas, spoons, or rolling pins? Forget it, game over\u2026\n\n\nAnyways, my point is it\u2019s way more complex than just rinsing that last bit of flour off the edge of a bowl before using it to cook for a person with celiac. That could make them incredibly sick anyways.", "Can you adopt me as a niece?\n\n I also can be picky as a kid if you like and don't have any restrictions or allergies! And I promise to always bring a bottle of wine to meals!", "O I did see this when I replied, but a power issue in the relationship is not good. She was his boss- I mean I understand that it can work but her being his superior and older by a bit..... I would be greatly concerned. \n\nI wonder if she is trying to alienate him from your family.", "Your BIL wouldn't necessarily know how hard it would be to protect Becca but Cheryl absolutely would. What happens when Becca has a reaction? Does Cheryl get a lot of attention? She would know the risk of Becca having a reaction if her allergies are that severe. WHAT IF she was *hoping* for you to mess up and she only got mad because you were *too* careful? I'm sorry I keep harping on this but her behavior in this situation is just SO weird.", "I am with you! Also, as a parent/wife of loved ones with sever allergies I won\u2019t cook for someone with different allergies unless they aren\u2019t severe. \n\nGoing out of your way to get truly safe food was super kind of you. Definitely NTA!", "I'm in my 30s and in the Southern US with egg allergies. I don't trust **anyone's** cooking.", "If OP had cooked for them I'll bet the mother would have found a way to make drama out of that as well. Because she honestly sounds like the kind of person you can't please.", "I had to eliminate a lot of types of food when trying to narrow down what was causing some health issues. It's shocking how many products have sneaky wheat, eggs, or nuts. Wheat and wheat byproducts, and eggs are in EVERYTHING. It was a serious learning curve. I'm an avid label reader and home cook. I still don't think I'd trust myself to cook for someone with a truly serious allergy. When I was going through the elimination period it was shocking when people would say \"oh you can eat that\" when clearly it wasn't acceptable. I wouldn't trust anyone's cooking.", "You are seriously suggesting that OP EVER cook anything again for Greg and Cheryl? They walked out mid-meal. I wouldn't want either of them to set foot on my property again. And no question I'd NEVER offer to boil water or make toast in their behalf.", ">She looked really confused and kind of sad.\n\nI'm going to be perfectly clear here: Greg and Cheryl are weaponizing her illness against you. She was probably having a great time, but then was sad that she had to leave because of her celiac disease (but we all know it's because Greg and Cheryl forced her to leave, without talking to her). I wouldn't be surprised if they've been doing this for Becca's whole life, and forcing her to miss out any kind of fun activity. Becca is going to grow up thinking that she missed out on events because of her disease, instead of learning to adapt to the world around her.\n\nYOU did a great job and were accommodating. Her parents are not doing a good job of raising her to handle her diseases. It sounds like they expect you to make food that only she can have, and everyone has to eat the same thing. Which is absurd.", "Same. It\u2019s shocking how much contains nuts or is processed with nuts. The egg allergy is particularly difficult to navigate as its in soooo much.", "You actually went through there trouble of researching appropriate restaurants that would suit her specific needs. That alone is thoughtful and went ahead and ordered her a full meal. Don\u2019t let this get to you", "Imagine someone being careful enough to not accidently almost kill your child. Damn. Some parents are really about the drama.", "yes the mother should have brought food for her celiac daughter, because unless OP cooked the entire meal to be suitable for the daughter (in which case the adults wouldn't be happy), cooking two completely separate meals with the precautions needed for the severely allergic would be too much to ask.

He recently had one after many years of avoidance and the chocolate is way worse than it used to be, and the peanut butter tastes more fake now.\n\nETA: I'm not allergic to sunflower seeds, but I can't bring myself to try them because they smell \\*so\\* much like peanut butter that my brain freaks out and won't accept that they're safe.", "Oof.
