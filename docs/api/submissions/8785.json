{"id": 8785, "submission_id": "10q7zhu", "title": "AITA for making homemade food for everyone except my brother's stepdaughter?", "selftext": "I (27F) am not a professional chef, but I have taken a bunch of cooking classes and love making elaborate meals for friends and family. About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. \n\nLast weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n\nI thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. \n\nI felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family.

I\u2019m honestly in disbelief you thought you did something wrong. You were incredibly thoughtful in how you handled ensuring she had a meal suitable for her. You have ADHD and are well aware that mistakes are so easily made so to ensure you didn\u2019t seriously put this child\u2019s health in danger, you decided the safest option was to contact a restaurant to provide something. \n\nI can\u2019t stress this enough, YOU ARE NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you accidently made a keto meal wrong, it would upset their diet. It sounds like if you made Becca's meal incorrectly, she could have a major medical issue. You're not wrong for not wanting that stress on you.", "So let me get this straight, your brother called you and A H because you didn\u2019t try to kill his step daughter?! \n\nCross contamination is a real thing! Is he really expecting you to create an elaborate meal for multiple guests, then clean every single inch of your kitchen, possibly buy new utensils, make the meal again adjusted for ALL their requirements and pray that you don\u2019t mess up?!\n\nBetter safe with ordering, than trying to accommodate and end up in the ER!\n\nNTA! You were an extremely generous and thoughtful host. If her allergies are so severe, I can\u2019t imagine why on earth wouldn\u2019t they check with you in advance what\u2019s the plan for dinner! Their entitlement is astonishing\u2026", "I would flat out say, \"I was worried I would kill her. It's not that I don't care about her; it's that I care about her enough to ensure I don't accidentally harm her.\" You might also point out that allergies are very different from preferences like keto. (Also, usually it's the people with the allergies pointing that out; WTF is going on here?)\n\nIf anyone questions you or gives you shit, use words like \"hospitalize\" or \"kill.\" It may sound dramatic, but those are legitimate fears, and that blunt wording will help get the point across.", "With all of those allergies and conditions that Becca has, Cheryl should\u2019ve been calling you and asking you what she can do to help with this dinner regarding feeding her own daughter. That is certainly what I would\u2019ve done. I have a teenage son who has severe allergies and celiac, as well as IBS. I have never have gone anywhere without discussing what the choices are for his meal and whether or not I should be providing it when we go along. Cheryl is the AH. Your brother is caught up in her behavior and is also the AH. \n\nYour behavior was kind, thoughtful, and generous. NTA.", "NTA. Celiac and dairy allergies are no joke, and while it's certainly possible to make a gluten and dairy free meal in a regularly home kitchen, there's always a possibility of contamination. You did what you thought was safest. They are the AHs for overreacting and making the event all about them, especially when it seems like Becca wasn't bothered.", "NTA\n\nA special diet being a fun challenge is one thing, a severe allergy that could result in a child being ill is another. Your solution was a very good one. I probably would have let them know ahead of time but really that\u2019s a minor thing.\n\nThey are letting their egos get in the way of what is safest for their kid", "Wow. This is a case of \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d coupled with \u201cif you dare break my precious, you are TA forevermore.\u201d You wanted to ensure your guest was served safe foods so you turned to the professionals. How dare you! Stop cooking your five-course meal for 20 people and instead make one single meal that checks all the safety boxes.\n\nNTA, but is your SIL ever one.", "NTA You cooked a five course meal for a bunch of people and out of an abundance of caution bought food for the one person who could suffer if you fucked up! Then one of those people unnecessarily and without really thinking about your effort and your concern took umbrage at that! You are definitely in the clear here.", "NTA. My husband found out last year that he has Celiac, and it has been a challenge to adjust our shopping and cooking habits. We had consultations with a dietician and it is unbelievable the ways that gluten can get into food. Your SIL should be grateful that you took so much consideration for her daughter\u2019s health by assuring that she got a meal free of allergens.", "NTA\n\nI think what you did to get her that meal was amazing and so thoughtful of you. If someone did this for my stepkids, I would be thrilled.\n\nAnyone saying your TA is seriously messed up. The child didn't seem to mind and still got to eat. Plenty of other people wouldn't have done what you did. Brother & SIL sound ungrateful.", "NTA. You DID take into account her dietary restrictions and did your best to ensure that she would have a delicious meal provided to her that would be safe for her to eat. It sounds to me like there's more at issue here than the meal though, just based on the language that was used and some of the details of the story. I don't want to make too many assumptions, but Cheryl sounds like a piece of work.", "NTA. There\u2019s a difference between a preference and a safety requirement. If you made a mistake it could have seriously injured this poor girl. You don\u2019t operate an allergen free kitchen and your brother should be grateful that you ensured a safe, quality meal for her.", "NTA\n\n  \nThis is not a \"ewwww I don't each spinach and i hate mushrooms\" kind of thing, this is a potentially life-threatening thing. People who are this allergic can get a reaction from simple cross-contamination. I would not have risked it either.\n\nYou paid for professionals to provide her a safe and yummy meal.", "Did your brother understand the reason why you ordered her a special meal?  That you were concerned about doing something that might make her sick?  My SIL has food restrictions and I have never heard her say anything but appreciation when others have done something similar for her.", "NTA-it's weird that her parents would rather risk her allergies to get her a homemade meal so that she's eating what everyone else eats instead of her actually getting a special meal so she didn't get sick or you know, die! You were cautious and didn't want to risk it, good on you. and if something were to happen if you made it homemade, they would blame you for it.", "NTA. Do they even like their daughter? You had every good reason not to cook for her. \n\nI don't enjoy cooking, but I can. And I made a great celiac-friendly meal for a couple friends once. I thought I did everything right, but my buddy was still sick at the end of the night. Luckily it was just discomfort, but it could have been worse. \n\nNow I refuse to cook for people who have serious allergies. I will not be responsible for making someone sick. And if that makes me a bad guy, I'll gladly be the villain.", "Ask Greg if he wants a living child eating a takeaway meal prepared safely in an allergen-free kitchen by specialist chefs because his sister was sensible, weighed up the risks and knew it wasn't worth it, or his daughter wheezing and turning blue, trying to use her epipen and potentially ending up in hospital or even dying, because his sister took a risk with his daughter's health? Because that's what it's a choice between.\n\nETA: allergen-free cooking for someone who's life depends on eating safe food is a whole different kettle of fish (no pun intended) to cooking for someone who has voluntarily decided to cut a foodstuff out of their diet.\n\nOP, absolutely NTA. Brother and SIL are TAs.", "NTA. You took her situation into account. You made a special meal for your parents. Knowing that your step niece couldn\u2019t enjoy it, you went out of your way to ensure she had something special just for her.", "NTA, she wasn't going to eat what everyone else was eating, unless everyone ate dairy free, gluten free, etc. This isn't the first or last time she'll be eating a different meal than everyone else.", "NTA How are people so entitled? That was nice of you to pick up something special.", "NTA, but you Brother and SIL are.", "NTA - I know who I wouldn\u2019t be inviting back for dinner ever again though", "NTA - making keto food is for a diet, not something that could risk a life. You were thoughtful and responsible and Becca should feel included since you went out of your way to have her own special meal prepared for her! Whenever I have friends with allergies over for dinner we always order out from a safe restaurant because I would hate for a mistake I made to harm them! You did the right thing", "Considering you would\u2019ve had to deep clean everything in your kitchen to make her food to ensure she wouldn\u2019t have a reaction, i think getting the food from a restaurant was a great idea. Your sister is very entitled to demand you make food after you took time and energy getting safe food for her child.\n\nMost people wouldn\u2019t even do that. There\u2019s so many people that don\u2019t cater to people with allergies or even don\u2019t believe those allergies exist. I think you went above and beyond for this meal. NTA", "Nta. That was so kind and thoughtful of you. It litrally takes a crumb. I'm sure your brother will calm down but he's way out of order.", "NTA. Celiac contamination is really easy to, and the consequences can be really severe really quickly. Making sure she had something safe to eat and know it might be out of your abilities is great self awareness. I think that was a great solution.", "NTA You went out of your way to make sure she had food that was safe to eat.\n\nIf she can go into anaphylaxis from a cooking mistake it's understandable if you didn't want to take the very real risk of her food getting cross-contamination. Even if you cooked the entire meal to the specifications, her food could have been contaminated by residual allergens in your environment.\n\nI think the only thing you could have done to avoid what happened would be to have given your brother a heads up that you were ordering her food from a specialty restaurant because you weren't confident you could cook food that wouldn't make your niece sick.\n\nIt was very bad manners for them to even make an issue of it during the dinner. If they had a problem with what you did they could have addressed it with you privately at some point later.", "NTA You did the most responsible thing possible. It would be incredibly dangerous for you to prepare her food in your kitchen due to the possibility of cross contamination. If you prepared her food with the same utensils that you used to prepare food with gluten and dairy in t you could kill her.", "NTA. As someone with allergies I\u2019d be so happy that someone went out of their way to order a meal for me. Cheryl and your brother sound entitled AF.", "NTA, Becca didn\u2019t care and she seemed to love the food. Which tells me this is your brother and  his wife problem. Adults always want to start something that isn\u2019t that serious.", "NTA. To order safe food was extremely generous of you. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. It sounds like they are actually embarrassed that they talked up your meal without bothering to do their own due diligence and find out how you intended to manage your niece's dietary restrictions. Anger is an easier emotion to feel than shame.\n\nYou did a really nice thing that solved the restriction issue without leaving someone with a bowl of lettuce.", "Wow, far from an AH. I thought your extreme sensitivity to her needs was more than thoughtful. You gave so much thought to her that you did everything you could to ensure she would have a meal that would work for her. I can imagine how many other families would not have done the same. \n\nYou did great. Your brother and his wife forgot that the event wasn't about the food or their daughter, but about celebrating family. \n\nNTA", "NTA - not even a little bit. \n\nBecca's allergies sound serious, and I'm honestly kind of surprised Cheryl would've even been okay with her eating a full cooked meal at your house given that fact. \n\nA friend of mine has kids with similar serious allergies, and she's very protective about what they eat and where since cross-contamination is a real issue for them. \n\nI think you went above and beyond for Becca, and she seemed fine eating it until her mom cast a storm cloud over the whole situation. \n\nCooking for preferential diets (keto, vegan, etc) is an entirely different thing than cooking for allergen diets, and there are SO many things to be cautious of at all times that unless you are specifically skilled in those allergens and how to avoid them, it's best to leave it to the professionals for the most part.", "So you threw a dinner party and took precautions to make sure you didn\u2019t hospitalize one of your guests\u2026\n\nNTA\n\nGreg and Cheryl sure are AHs here because they either lied or don\u2019t care if Becca is hospitalized. Parents of celiacs understand the risks. AHs like to be troublesome to kind people. Don\u2019t sweat it. \n\nI can\u2019t have gluten, don\u2019t have celiac, but still react very poorly. I wouldn\u2019t avoid delicious delicious sourdough for 11 years if that weren\u2019t the case. It sucks being invited to eat but being scared of whether or not sustenance will hospitalize you. You did good. Most folks don\u2019t even bother to try.", "NTA. You bought her a meal. Making a 5 course meal for a bunch of people wasn\u2019t enough so they expect you to make a separate meal for ONE 9 year old? That is just rude.", "NTA. You were responsible and thoughtful and your brother happily let his wife spit in your face for it.\n\nI would give him a serious talking to about how he thinks he can treat you.", "NTA\n\nBecca was fine. SIL made it an issue and made her husband go talk to you. \n\nConsider not making them any of your delicious meals to teach them a lesson \ud83d\ude02\n\nThey could have easily arranged a visit with you for just their family and asked you to cook everyone the same meal (that Becca could eat).\n\nSIL is a crap starter and was looking for an issue. Of course her daughter wouldn\u2019t be eating the same thing as everyone else. Are they implying everything should have been something Becca could eat? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nWhat you did was thoughtful and kind. No risk of cross contamination. They should have thanked you. Talk to your brother one on one of you can. Explain yourself without his wife there. Then mention not cooking for them again (be petty for me) \ud83d\ude02", "NTA and you did the exact right thing! \nIn fact, I, also an ADHDer, did this exact same thing last time I hosted people, I got some awesome vegan tacos from a great little place down the street from us. \nCross contamination is no joke and it is always better to be safe. The parents should have been thrilled that you made the safest choice, especially given the child was happy with her meal.", "NTA! I have severe food allergies and I\u2019d have been truly touched that you thought to do that. Cross contamination is no joke.", "NTA in the slightest.  I\u2019m appalled that your brother and sil were offended by your (very considerate) actions.  My kids grew up with friends who are celiac and the parents always made sure the kids had their own, safe food for birthday parties and such.  \n\nCeliac is serious and I don\u2019t blame you for being anxious.  Ordering from a certified gluten free restaurant was the best and safest option.  \n\nI\u2019m genuinely flabbergasted that anyone would think you were being an AH for being concerned about your niece\u2019s health.", "NTA - It was really smart of you to order out when you were making so many other dishes in your own kitchen - avoiding cross contamination would have been difficult and risky. In a commercial kitchen you can dedicate a space, not so in your own home. They need to see it from this perspective, that you were protecting the kid and being inclusive. If you feel bad you could always make her something special another time when you don't have  a bunch of other dishes in progress.", "people in this comment section don\u2019t realize that people with celiac need completely separate pots, pans, cutting boards, and any other utensils. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you ordered her fast food. You made every effort to ensure everyone had a nice meal to eat and didn\u2019t go into anaphylaxis.", "NTA, those are tough dietary restrictions and it was rude to imply that you should have prepared something homemade. You did not leave her out and were nice enough to order something that she could have.", "NTA - You went out of your way to make sure Becca had a meal she could enjoy that fit her dietary needs! Getting the takeout meal was nice of you.", "NTA.  If anything you went out of your way to accommodate her.", "NTA.  You went out of your way to accommodate (a lot of times people with severe allergies will not want/expect someone else to prepare their food) and did so the safest way you knew possible.  Your brother and his wife should be grateful.  You could have easily said \u201cthat\u2019s too much for me\u201d and let them handle her food, but you still made sure she would be included one way or another.  Also, you already prepared one five course meal, preparing two is a lot for one person!  I think it\u2019s kind of insane that they expected you to prepare two!  And lastly, if you were to have prepared her a meal, whose to say they wouldn\u2019t have trusted it and your efforts would have gone to waste.", "NTA.  It sounds to me like you were very thoughtful in the fact that you wanted to make absolutely sure she would have food that wouldn't make her sick.  I can kind of see where they're coming from, but they need to look at it from your perspective also and realize what you did was for her safety.", "NTA. If the allergy is serious enough that she needs an epi-pen, I'm not taking any chances. Unless you completely cleared your kitchen of all offending ingredients, cross contamination would be very easy in a home kitchen. Like you'd need to remember to wash your hands if you got even the smallest drop of milk on you. \n\nHowever, I would have run your idea past Becca's parents first so that they wouldn't be surprised. Especially as kids can be picky and Becca might have wanted to pick something from the menu herself (sounds like she was happy with the food though).", "NTA at all! She has a severe allergy, I wouldn't have been comfortable either. One imperfectly cleaned bowl and she could've landed in the hospital. And I've got a STRONG feeling they'd have 1. Blamed you and 2. Handed you the hospital bill.", "NTA you were incredibly sweet about this. \u201cI wanted her to be included but I didn\u2019t want to harm the child\u201d is gold star behavior", "NTA  mom of type 1 diabetic.  Not the job of anyone else to manage her diabetes but us.  If your brother or sil didn't call you to discuss you cooking for the neice than their being dramatic and making noise because they like drama.  Don't play into it.", "Before reading, I thought you were gonna say you just didn\u2019t make anything because you couldn\u2019t bother to put in extra effort. But after reading, you went out of your way to make sure she was fed and safe. I say NTA, and if they decide to be offended by you providing a safe meal, they can bring food for her next time.", "NTA! Listen, I have kids with severe food allergies. Do you know how every invitation to anyone\u2019s house starts? With having a conversation about food strategy, and usually me offering to bring something special for my kids, because I do not want to make extra work for the host, AND, number one priority, I want my kids safe! And not just one time, every time, people not living the allergy parent life forget things. Assuming someone else is going to understand how to safely prepare food for a person with allergies, without a conversation, is a recipe for a trip to the ER!  How would the conversation have gone if she had a reaction from cross-contamination? \n\nINFO: what is usually done for Becca\u2019s meals, in the 2+ years she\u2019s been part of the family?", "NTA\n\nI would be worried about cross-contamination going on in a home kitchen when you're making not-safe food at the same time too. You probably should have mentioned it to them in advance, but definitely not the asshole for doing what you did.", "NTA at all.", "Nta I would have told him to duck off and walked away", "NTA, nobody wants to risk making a child sick.", "NTA - I would have straight out told him to shut up and explain why I did what I did.  You did it because you care so much, you wanted to make sure NOTHING was done improperly.", "NTA. I have Celiac and my ultimate fear is having to turn down food when people sweat they made this special thing for me and they were so careful, but I can never \\*Really\\* be sure and I'm a people pleaser and feel like I have to eat it anyway. If someone did this for me, I'd be so grateful", "NTA you went out of your way to get safe food for her. You do not have a dairy and gluten free set up. You could have made her incredibly sick. They are out of line expecting you to risk making her sick, she carries an epi pen for goodness sakes! You could find some recipes give them to her mom to sign off on and go to their house and cook them. Id think since it\u2019s so serious they\u2019d have a gluten and dairy free house.", "NTA, people on keto and vegan diets aren't going to get very sick if you accidentally use the wrong spoon. The stakes were much higher here, especially if you were also making food that was not safe for her in the same kitchen.", "NTA. You don't have a grain free kitchen. You could have made her contaminated food. It would be very bad for her.", "NTA\nWhen my kids were young they had friends with serious food allergies. Their parents would bring their own food from home to ensure it was safe.  What you did was very thoughtful. You seem more worried about the child than her stepfather.", "NTA\n\nYou were scared of cooking something that could potentially and accidentally made her sick, so you got something from an allergic-free restaurant for her, just so she can eat something good and safe. If that's not caring, I don't know what is...\n\nBecca's parents clearly overreacted in that situation. You were trying to do it good. Leaving the party just because you ordered something from outside, so she can be safe (and apparently, that clearly didn't bother Becca, she seemed fine.) is just a major overreaction. They could've let that slide, and talk about it after finishing the meal, at least...\n\nBetter be safe now than sorry later, as everyone says.", "NTA.  You were a thoughtful and gracious host. It isn't your fault if some guests didn't appreciate your efforts. They were very rude.", "Nta. You did include Becca. You got her a nice meal that was safe for her to eat.", "Cheryl started the fight because she wanted to. Your brother has his head so far up her ass, that the toxic smell is keeping him from being rational.\n\nCheryl did not want to come in the first place. Instead appreciating the effort you made she preferred the drama. She found a reason to leave bcoz she didn't want to be there.\n\nNTA", "NTA you went out of you want to accommodate and include her.  While she didn\u2019t eat what you all ate you still thought about her.  Food allergies can be a huge deal.  You thought about her safety.", "NTA. Your brother and his wife are incredibly entitled. You did what was safest for the child and that should matter the most.\n\nEdit to also say that it\u2019s really dumb for parents of a child with such restrictions to not inquiry about food before. Or offer to bring their own. The entitlement is huge!", "NTA If I was the mom and you explained to me it wasn't the effort but the fear of contaminating it and making her sick that was the reason, I actually would have been touched you cared enough to be extra cautious.", "NTA, you were keeping their child safe, and it sounds like you ordered from a very nice place, it\u2019s not like it was some sort of cheap, crappy afterthought. Your brother and SIL are total assholes, as are the people commenting that you are. You were extremely thoughtful and caring.", "NTA, Cheryl and your brother are acting entitled.\n\nIn order to cook for severe allergies, you would have had to make everyone's meal with the same restrictions after fully and deeply cleaning your kitchen and all cooking utensils. This is not an easy task. You went above and beyond to accommodate Becca's needs.\n\nAlso, cooking without Flour and Dairy can be very difficult, both are used in a lot of ingredients and may not be mentioned in them.", "Wow NTA. That would be a hard ask for anyone especially on a special ocassion. They're blowing things out of proportion. You weren't comfortable cooking for her and found a great solution especially since the restaurant specializes in that. They should be thankful you were so thoughtful", "NTA at all. Based on the title I was waiting for something much worse \u2014 you did the completely responsible and accommodating thing. No idea why anyone would be mad about that, especially if it\u2019s so severe an epi-pen has to be carried. I wouldn\u2019t mess with that shit either - like you said, one wrong spoon", "NTA.    There\u2019s gluten in a lot of stuff you might not even think about like even some spices.   And if she needs an epi-pen they should be grateful that you took care of her and didn\u2019t take any chances.   The advice to always assume good intentions instead of bad intentions would be useful for them.  I feel like there\u2019s got be more here under their skin than meets the eye.", "NTA \u2014 if you were worried about making a mistake with the kid\u2019s food, maybe cross-contaminating because or your ADHD, buying hers safe take-out meal was the right choice. Your priority was ensuring the child\u2019s food was safe. This is a case where making a mistake could have been life-threatening for the child. That\u2019s not a challenge. That\u2019s an absolute necessity that her food be totally free from allergens. You don\u2019t mess around with someone\u2019s life. Good choice.", "NTA at all u went out of ur way to accommodate her by ordering from a restaurant. Sil sounds super entitled.", "NTA. Yes you should explain to the brother and his wife, but the person you MOST need to explain to is Becca. Kids are very understanding and it sounds like she was enjoying the meal. The parents' feelings are not the important ones here; Becca should be the focus. Make sure she understands that you got her a separate meal because you wanted her to be able to participate but still be protected because you care about her\n\nI doubt it crossed her mind organically, but she has likely now heard her parents talk about it and may start to believe she was being left out", "NTA. \n\nIt's really hard to accommodate various allergies and if they're as serious as you have been led to believe, this was a perfect solution. Your brother knows you try to accommodate and instead of defending you to his wife or giving you the benefit of the doubt and asking for an explanation, he went immediately with \"you're being mean and singling out this child on purpose.\"", "NTA. I have a lot of allergy friends who take their own food everywhere because hobby cooks and regular people just don\u2019t have the necessary space, tools, and knowledge to avoid cross contamination. It\u2019s literally safer for them to bring their own food. Kinda sorta wondering if they\u2019re exaggerating the risk to Becca, most allergy families would appreciate the extra expense and length you went to to ensure the safety of the allergic person.", "NTA. You accommodated Becca. Also, I too am not comfortable cooking for someone who has celiac as everything has to be cleaned to a microscopic level. I would have done the exact same thing as you. \n\nWhat is funny to me here is that it sounds like the step daughter didn't care and was happy but now that the parents have made a big deal of it she probably now feels like you don't care when that was never the case. What a shame that the parents did that.", "NTA. As someone with a severe allergic you were incredibly considerate.

Id feel safer eating something from a restaurant dedicated to no cross contamination vs risking it and then possibly dying.", "Um, NTA.  If Becca has such serious food allergies, the BEST way to avoid cross contamination is to completely isolate her food, which you did.  \n\nMy sister eats Kosher, and we've done kosher restaurant takeout for years for her.  Why? Because my sister herself pointed out that kosher restaurants were used to cooking within kosher restrictions and thus, actually, was better than what I made, trying my hardest. (Maybe I suck at cooking but the point remains:)\n\nI can only imagine that a restaurant that specializes in allergen-safe cooking has probably mastered not only allergen safe but delicious.  \n\nYou made her feel included: You served her food, that she could SAFELY eat, at your table. That's included.  If someone went out of their way AND EXPENSE to accommodate my food sensitivity (I can't do dairy) I'd feel incredibly grateful.", "NTA. \n\nI grew up with severe peanut allergies.

Wow, what a reaction to such a kind and thoughtful gesture!\n\nIf you are to be faulted for anything it might be not speaking to her parents first and letting them know ahead of time, but you went so far out of your way to make a special accommodation for Becca, I can't see how they have the nerve to be upset with you.", "NTA. you were ensuring her safety, and having adhd isn't even relevant here -- people can make whatever choices they feel comfortable with to make sure they're doing their due diligence when others' safety is entrusted to them.", "NTA you didn't trust yourself to make the meal, so YOU provided, paid for, and picked up a proper alternative for her.

I don't know any home kitchen (even real expensive fancy ones) that has enough (1) counter space, (2) cooking utensils and pots and pans, (3) refrigerator space for ingredients to cook 2 identical five-course meals - one GF and one not.  Plus there's the issue that more advanced/complicated dishes have more ingredients, making it so much easier for problematic ingredients to slip through the cracks (it's wild some of things that contain gluten).

It takes so little to accidentally contaminate someone with gluten.\n\n3. Gluten is in literally everything you can (and can\u2019t) imagine and you have to somewhat know what you\u2019re looking for. Just because a product says gluten free doesn\u2019t mean that it is.

I have ended up in the hospital before from being glutened\u2026it is a frustrating and at times debilitating disease. In addition to being so sick I can\u2019t keep anything down for at least a week, being glutened as a celiac increases my risk for cancer exponentially.

Not your fault they set up high expectations", "NTA. As a vegan who a lot of times is left out of meals, I\u2019d be ecstatic if someone went to the trouble you did", "Nta. Even very well meaning people can mess up when it comes to cross contamination. Just like you said, a sligthly unwashed spoon or something gets stuck in the fiber of a cutting board. A restaurant who specializes in catering to people with those types of allergies will have their entire kitchens and equipment who has never touched stuff that has those types of foods. If anything, you were taking her condition extremely seriously which shows that you care.

You deserve thanks.", "NTA if I had that serious of allergies I\u2019d make sure to bring my own food to insure I have something to eat, I\u2019d never expect for someone to bend over backwards to MY needs.

Even your spices can have gluten and you'd be surprised at the amount of things with hidden dairy in them. The fact that you found a place that caters specifically to her allergens is great. \n\nIn the future, my only advice is to give people a heads up that they're getting a separate meal instead of surprise catering if you're hosting a dinner. The way you phrased it did make it seem like the whole meal would be friendly and not that you were hosting dinner and buying her food too. It's not often people are willing to cook allergen friendly meals so they're likely just acting out their disappointment in the disclusion without really thinking about how unsafe it is for you to be fucking with an allergy.", "Geezus. Definitely NTA. I feel like what you did was respectful and lovely and I would have been super appreciative if you\u2019d have gone to those lengths to protect her.

It seems like you were paying for every other time Becca has had issues come up with her diet, even though your approach was caring and responsible.", "NTA.

If anything it shows how much you care about Becca and want her to be safe.", "NTA\nWhen people are looking to be offended about something they\u2019re usually able to find it. \n\nYou had a perfect solution to the problem that didn\u2019t exclude you step niece in the slightest.

It's ridiculous for your brother to think you are going to make a separate meal for one person. You found a suitable resteraunt that prepares food for those with allergies and paid for this meal. You did great in my opinion.", "NTA what a sweet thoughtful thing you did! You took the time to find a restaurant that could accommodate her dangerous food allergies and made the effort to procure an entire meal for her!

If you messed up, you'd be the one responsible for her sickness/death, and if they can't understand that you don't want that sort of responsibility, then I say good riddance.\n\nETA: Maybe you could've told them that, but I don't think that makes you an AH.", "NTA. \n\nYou tried your best to accommodate her without risking her getting sick. \n\nMaking something vegan or keto is not the same as making something that is completely gluten and dairy free.

Getting a meal from specialist firm  who will have clean kitchens  and processes to avoid cross contamination is a lovely way to deal with it. And much safer than her eating things prepared in an ordinary kitchen were items containing her allergy triggers are present.", "NTA, you provided her with a full meal of stuff she could eat. YWBTA if you left her with nothing whilst everyone else ate", "NTA. Given how serious her allergies are, I wouldn\u2019t feel confident cooking for her either. I\u2019d be terrified of sending her to the hospital", "NTA, if you had cooked using wheat flour, any particles that made its way to the celiac friendly meal would have contaminated it. This was the safest and smartest option for someone who has such severe restrictions. Unless the whole kitchen is entirely wheat free it can be hard to keep residue out of the food, with flour particles being able to hang in the air for quite some time. I think this was a really good solution to the issue outside of having the kid eat nothing but salad for dinner.", "NTA you went out of you way. I have a food allergy and would never expect anyone to do this. Also it's very tricky to cook for allergies, it's taken me a long time figure out all the ingredients and hidden allergens.

Just can't please some people.", "Omg so much NTA.  You probably spent a lot more money on Becca\u2019s plate than the rest of your guests and went to a place where you knew it would be prepared in a way safe for her.

Being confident in accommodating non threatening, by-choice diets and not taking a risk when there's a risk of severe health problems cannot be compared at all.\n\nIt is in fact very thoughtful to seek out a restaurant specializing in foods that you can serve to Becca. If anything, it is quite inclusive and accommodating to your guest and a new family member.\n\nConsidering she will be in countless situations where she will inevitably have to eat differently than the rest of the party she's with, I don't think Greg and Cheryl's reactions are going to help her in the future.\n\nPerhaps you could offer to cook something for her in the future where you will feel more comfortable to make it safe for her (when you're also not preparing the host a good number of people). However I wouldn't blame you not to think about offering that if Greg's reaction was that poor in the first place.", "NTA. She will probably have this happen several times throughout her life, too. If you're not dairy and gluten free at home normally, it's EXTREMELY difficult to convert over, and I have ADHD as well and understand exactly why it makes you nervous to even think about cooking for Becca. I'd be super happy my kid's safety was thought of to begin with!", "NTA! Your kitchen would be a cross contamination nightmare for severe allergies. You did the good and safe thing. Your brother and his wife are the a-holes here.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t exclude her and made a special effort to provide a nice meal for her to eat within her dietary guidelines.

Fuck em.", "NTA, you did make her feel included by ensuring she had a full meal the same size as everyone else. She\u2019s 9 and perfectly capable of understanding why you bought her meal vrs making it, if she actually had a problem with it, which it doesn\u2019t appear she did. It\u2019s not like you asked her parents for pay for the meal either, or anything else. You took it upon yourself to make sure she had what she needed to be a part of the dinner and not at risk. I\u2019m sure if you had made an entire meal based off of her dietary restrictions other people would have maybe had a problem with it, but again with something as deadly as her allergies it was better to be safe anyways", "WTF? NTA.. I was expecting that you were going to say, sorry, have a can of tuna or something. I think you went out of the way as it was and having cooked quite a bit I know how time consuming it can be. I try to accommodate but usually that's dealing with taste preferences, not life or death.

Imagine you made a mistake and glutened her, that would have been much worse.", "NTA. They\u2019re TA. It wasn\u2019t malicious and you took it upon yourself to accommodate her safely. What pisses me off the most about this is that if OP had tried and failed or been careless and the little girl had a reaction they would have still been on her case. She has severe food allergies so she won\u2019t always fit in at big dinners and her parents should be preparing her for that reality instead of doing this", "Sounds like Becca\u2019s parents need more education about celiac disease.

There's a world of difference between allergic, and epi pen allergic. You can't know the threshold. \n\nI liked someone else's idea of cooking at their house after explaining why you did it the way you did.

Seeing as how most cheap restaurants I've been through can't even remember to omit one thing.  Your brother and his wife are being unreasonable and  not doing their daughter any favors trying to defend her when they have no reason to defend her.  \n\nIf the many stories I've seen involving severe dietary restrictions are any indication of life with allergies she is likely going to come across many times in her life where she will need to bring her own food.

There are so many things people who don\u2019t encounter this on a regular basis wouldn\u2019t think of when preparing the food. \n\nThose parents should not be so indifferent to what their child is eating.

About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. \n\nLast weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n\nI thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. \n\nI felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.  Absolutely.  But if you haven't had a chance to explain, I'd suggest you do it ASAP.  If they can't accept it, then they have to do an attitude adjust.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA. You do not get to stress people about allergies, and then get upset when they do their best to not expose you to those allergens. It sounds like the mom just wanted a fight.", "NTA I'd say you deserve a medal for trying to accommodate her in the safest way you could think of. And she wasn't even mad, your brother was. Why didn't he volunteer to cook a safe meal that everyone could enjoy?", "NTA.\n\nYou are aware of your limitations and drew a line when it comes to a child\u2019s health.\n\nThe only improvement I can think of is you could have spoken with your brother before the meal, so it was not a surprise for them.", "She's 9... her mum could've just told her some BS story about how it's a special meal for her made by you and she wouldn't be any wiser... you made every effort you can to accomodate the kid... you feld unsafe making food for her... as a parent if you start feeling that way and my kid has severe food allergies i'd agree please don't cook for my kid...\n\nthe only one who excluded her was her mother... you literally went through extra hoops for the kid... no need to feel bad you did great and i bet the food was delicious!\n\nNTA", "Sooooo NTA!!!!! You\u2019re so kind and considerate!!", "NTA.", "Five courses cooked by a person with ADHD and hosting a child with potentially deadly allergies in a kitchen not set up for those restrictions. Holy crap, if that was my kid and you ordered in to make her safe I'd have kissed you.\n\nNTA\n\nShe was a guest, not the guest of honor. Now if the party was for her that would have been not cool as all the dishes should be something she could eat.", "NtA\n\nYou took a precautionary measure to make sure she had safe food to eat due to the severity of her allergies. Your bro and sil's reaction was over the top, especially since the stepdaughter clearly didn't have an issue with the meal (I'm sure due to her allergies she's probably use to eating something different than what the people around her are eating) \n\nBro and Sil are the assholes in this situation", "NTA. Your brother is being ridiculous. Making a separate menu for one person is bad enough but with her allergies take out was a great option. Becca will be eating different things from everyone else for the rest of her life. My nephew is deathly allergic to cashews and dairy. He\u2019s 3 yet he knows some foods are not good for him. My sil does not expect us to make separate food for him. You were very considerate.", "NTA!\n\nMost people\u2019s don\u2019t know how hard dietary restrictions can be to accommodate for the severely allergic. \n\nMy friend cannot have preshredded cheese or frozen veggie blends because it\u2019s often coated in cornstarch and she\u2019s allergic. Most people would just see she is allergic to corn and assume since the labels don\u2019t say corn there isn\u2019t a problem.  This would be HOW she found out there was a problem!\n\nAnother friend cannot have any gluten - which means no American Soy Sauce because there\u2019s wheat in most brands!", "NTA. I think your compromise was very thoughtful and went above and beyond what you needed to do. Your brother is 100% in the wrong for throwing a fit. I do, however, think it would be nice for you to host a similar dinner party with all the family but prepare a homemade meal that Becca can enjoy. Your brother's over reaction was out of line, but if by some chance Becca did feel a little left out it would be nice to show her she is definitely thought of/ included. I hope your brother apologizes to you as well.", "NTA but you should have mentioned it to them prior what you were doing and why you were doing it", "NTA - would it have been nice if you could have made her something special ?  Yes of course and maybe you could plan something specific for her still as a gesture of your love for her.  But speaking as someone with food sensitivities and issues you absolutely did the right thing in this instance.  Much better to be safe than sorry.  Plus frankly if this is her situation she absolutely used to it being an issue by now and probably appreciated not only that you thought to do something to accommodate her, but that it was also a worry free solution. Your focus was scattered and you had enough on your plate (fun pun) with having to cook so many other dishes as to prevent you from being able to give it the attention it required.  I say do a special meal for her another time.  Invite them over and serve them all the same special meal.  You are not a short order cook and good on you for knowing your limitations and for being cautious.  As a limited eater I personally would prefer your solution over worrying what you might have accidentally cross contaminated my meal with and over you making a big fuss over me.  It gets so old and embarrassing having a fuss made at every meal.  I\u2019m fine I\u2019m completely used to it, I can make do with a side dish or plain salad that is my normal.  It\u2019s everyone else butting in and making a big to do about it (her well meaning parents) that is annoying and make you feel singled out as an oddity.", "NTA, pretty entitled reaction of your brother and his wife. I would send them a text explaining you didn't want to risk getting the kid getting sick and that you carefully chose that food. I would also add that's it's ridiculous to blow this out of proportion and make such a huge stink. The girl is 9 ffs. As long as she liked it and didnt have an issue, what's the problem?", "I was leaning NAH - but I think it was actually over-the-top for them to leave, so I'm going NTA as Greg overreacted. \n\nBut I do think your reputation as an advanced-level cook complicates things a bit. It really does sound like there was genuine excitement to eat YOUR food. And at the same time -- all of your concerns were reasonable. Now that you know their desire to eat YOUR food - maybe you invite them for a do-over and explain the genuine misunderstanding?", "Another perfect example of everyone believing they should be accommodated. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s responsibility to accommodate other specific needs in their own home. Honestly you went far and above what you needed to. I\u2019m my humble opinion when people are coming over for dinner they can eat what I prepare or they can bring their own\u2026.. no skin off my back.", "NTA!", "You did the responsible thing by outsourcing to people who make the kind of food that's safe of Becca as their profession. And it's not like you gave her something slapdash and insulting. Becca herself didn't seem to feel left out, that was purely Cheryl making trouble. Apparently she cares more about profiling than the strong possibility of her daughter ending up with a life threatening allergic reaction if you had cooked her meal yourself. NTA", "NTA. I am curious as to why they didn't reach out beforehand to make arrangements for Becca.\nI have made the habit of taking food I made at dinners and telling the host beforehand \"please don't worry about accomodating me, I am happy to enjoy your company\".

And I would buy them a present later.", "Oh ffs! For years I\u2019d go to my family\u2019s homes for birthdays and such and literally be not provided with anything at all I could eat. Which was honestly a bit rude in hindsight, but I finally started bringing myself something to eat and then it was almost like that gave my whole family a come to Jesus realization that they had inviting me to their home as a guest and not bothering to try to provide anything for me as they should have as the hosts and they\u2019re started making certain they provided gluten free items. Here\u2019s a reality check for your brother. I use SEPARATE PANS for my food than my family does for their regular foods because gluten can get caught behind screws and in crevices of pans and I could easily get sick.y doctor clued me in to that. It\u2019s unlikely you have pans that haven\u2019t had gluten cooked in it and would inadvertently be risking Becca\u2019s health.", "A preference is one thing.

You provided her food and she was fine it's just other people making the issues about them.", "NTA. You went out of your way to ensure she was catered for, which is more than her parents did! If they\u2019d done so, they\u2019d have known your intentions before the meal was served. They just come across as really entitled.", "NTA. Some people like Greg are just so arrogant that they feel the need to get on their moral high horse and project their own bullshit onto others at every possible opportunity.

As someone with 2 serious food allergies (one of which is celiac), I often prefer to bring my own food that I know is safe. Even small things like a splash of beer to a sauce recipe make me violently sick. HOWEVER, if you did not communicate your reasoning for not cooking for her beforehand, I can understand why she would feel left out/be upset. \n\nI was diagnosed at age 6, and as a child it was really sad and hard to not get to eat what everyone else was eating (even if it was for my safety). If you told them your reasoning for wanting her to pick up a meal you know is safe, it is on them to tell their daughter that she will get a \u201cspecial\u201d meal just for her.", "NTA unfortunately your brother\u2019s wife wears the pants in that family", "NTA for sure. But maybe next time plate it up nicely it kinda sounds like you put the take out container in front of her while everyone else was eating from plates and such.

And maybe ask if you can talk to her and explain that you where scared, and then cook something together with her in her kitchen? This isn't her fault, and even tho she might have seemed OK,  I guess her parents where also afraid for her to be hurt. \n\nSo we have a bunch of adults being afraid to hurt a little girl, and in this process hurting each other.

I\u2019m assuming this is your first time dealing with actual major food allergies and you made the safest course of action at this moment. But in the future, I\u2019d say make it all safe since people with these allergies are more often than not left out or have to bring their own food (there\u2019s the Indian-South African influencer with a crap ton of allergies and she always ends up bringing her own food), which makes dinner events suck emotionally. And it\u2019s not your fault your brother hyped you up without actually talking to you about the meal.

You wouldn\u2019t want the child to think she wasn\u2019t worth your effort, as that wasn\u2019t the case.", "NAH. Lack of communication is the issue here. They expected that you'd cook for everyone, and you got takeout for the girl instead. I can see how it might affect the child, but in your situation it seems like it was okay, luckily. Kids can be sensitive and not understand things. Best to ask in advance what to do about it if you're really wanting to put your best effort in hosting.

If I'm hosting at home, I usually have safe food delivered from a safe restaurant. Because I want to make sure she stays healthy.\n\nI don't get how they would think you don't care enough about the nibling since you made sure to have healthy things for her.

It might not seem like it, but it's a big deal for us when we're thought of and included! Not to mention that you're absolutely right in thinking that prepping the meal at home could have resulted in cross contamination so extra points for researching a place that handles both of the restrictions!!", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. \n\nEven touching the outside of a container with contaminated hands and continuing to cook could trigger an allergic response. You went out of your way to ensure she was 100% safe.

As a chef myself, I commend you for taking so many precautions and prioritizing this girls safety. Cooking for people with serious allergies is TERRIFYING. I personally don\u2019t think you should eat at normal restaurants if you have a life threatening allergy to an ingredient used there because the tiniest mistake can have the biggest consequence. I can\u2019t tell you how many times in restaurants I\u2019ve worked at the kitchen crew has had to fully sanitize the whole kitchen for gluten and shellfish allergies and despite that sanitation, all the cooks are on edge because a microscopic missed spot on the counter could be fatal to a guest. It\u2019s too much responsibility to place on overworked, underpaid cooks and you recognize that it\u2019s a responsibility you don\u2019t feel comfortable with either, very understandably. Big kudos to you.\n\nIn the future, definitely clarify your intentions with your brother and SIL but truly, I don\u2019t think they should be mad at you at all. It\u2019s not like you told them to bring food for her or just straight up didn\u2019t provide her with a meal\u2014you went out of your way to give her food she seemed to enjoy and secured her safety in the process.", "This is crazy.

One molecule can cause severe health issues for them - even washed pots, pans, cutting boards, etc. that have previously had gluten can be unsafe.\n\nYou did the right thing.

I would be equally worried about cooking for someone if allergies that severe. \n\nI would however send a polite email or letter to Greg and Cheryl explaining your reasoning and how you did not mean to make Cheryl and Becca feel excluded. That,yes you could cook great vegan and keto meals but the consequences of getting it wrong are much lower and you were very concerned about making sure Becca had a good first meal with the family. It sounds like her bio-parent is very concerned about how people are going to take her and her daughter and you hit some triggers.

I think you faltered when you didn\u2019t tell them ahead of time you were not making the food. \nIf you are unable to guarantee a dairy and gluten free environment then you provided a safe alternative. I\u2019m a school nurse and we have restaurants that will not offer gluten free options for lunch because they can\u2019t guarantee contamination free.

I would have let them know you couldn\u2019t provide a safe home cooked alternative ahead of time but otherwise you did great.", "I agree. OP was so considerate and worried about Becca and did something really nice. Initially I was worried Becca was gonna be served some microwave garbage, but a high quality restaurant that specializes in avoiding her deadly allergens probably wasn\u2019t cheap. \n\nSounds like Becca was perfectly happy to have tasty take out, and SIL should have been a little more grateful at your thoughtfulness", "I'm just left wondering what everyone else's reaction was to them actually leaving because of this.

OP you did good, your friends though.", "I second this, NTA at all.

Any form of cross contamination can have serious consequences. \n\nTheir biggest complaint is that other people do not take it seriously enough, or that they get invited somewhere and can't eat anything.

I expected to say they're TA since a lot of dietary restrictions are very doable to accommodate, but celiacs is no joke. A single crumb would be enough to increase her likelihood of bowl cancer. If they don't have the high-level setup necessary to ensure no contamination, it's worth paying for a professionally prepared meal that's guaranteed to be celiac friendly.", "My sister had a friend with allergies. They had colour coded chopping boards, separate microwaves, separate toasters, pots, pans, utensils. She had her own cupboard in the house for her food. Someone using her allergen in her microwave could have killed her because of how extreme her allergies were. (Unfortunately, they were too common and too many for the whole house to avoid) so I totally agree with you.

This does not justify her ingratitude and rudeness but it might help to explain a senseless reaction.", "This!!!! My cousin\u2019s both have celiac and at times had other issues where they had to do some elimination diets. Every family meal or get together, my aunt and uncle would inquire about the menu and bring whatever needed to do a gluten free substitute. Pasta, pizza shells, stuffing, etc. whatever so the girls could have what we were having and the host didn\u2019t have that on their proverbial plate. \n\nThe fact that the parents aren\u2019t asking ahead and just assuming that a whole other meal would be cooked without cross contamination is alarming. They come off as not gf about the daughter\u2019s health and just looking to start shit. Poor kid", "Depending on how sensitive the person is with their celiac, cooking in a normal kitchen might not be safe. When I got my diagnosis I had to get all new cutting boards, all plastic bowls had to go, wooden utensils were iffy. I had to give away a huge portion of my spices. My toaster had to be replaced.

Cooking keto/vegan/etc to accommodate dietary preferences is a different proposition than cooking allergy-free in a contaminated space...especially for the first time, with life-endangering stakes.\n\nI have cooked for friends with a severe gluten allergy, and it got to a point where I'd send them recipe menu/ingredients ahead of time because there's a lot of tricky stuff involved. Rice crispy treats for dessert? Nope, the cereal contains malt. Soy sauce to deepen flavor of beef stew? Nope, many soy sauces aren't gluten free so it needs to be skipped or substituted with tamari.

They won\u2019t be invited to dinners from others as well.  \nWhat a way to lose relatives and friends and alienate people. \nNTA", "Agree completely - NTA. The only thing that may have smoothed things over is a heads up to Becca personally letting her know you were excited for her to join and to make sure she\u2019s safe that you ordered a special meal for her from a great and allergen safe restaurant.

Honestly, I don't see the point to give the brother a heads up. The food was perfectly adapted to the girl condition and she knows she can't eat the same from others. And at her age, I bet she doesn't care if OP cooks her food or orders it as long as she likes it. The parents just like make everything about themselves...\nI am also concerned they didn't contact OP a few days before the dinner to discuss the menu with her if the condition of their child is so serious. Seems really weird to me.", "It's like Mom doesn't know about the cross contamination issues in kitchens. Especially at a stranger's home.", "100% agree here. OP was responsible here and is NTA. The risk of cross-contamination was likely higher due to OP having ADHD, as is mentioned in the post. I am glad OP was self-aware in this situation and made the choices they did. You are right. The kid could have died if her food was prepared using utensils that had touched things she was allergic to. Big props to OP for knowing themselves well and going the extra mile to make sure the kid was safe to eat.

Let\u2019s say she didn\u2019t realized and used one kitchen utensil that was cross contaminated with other food not suitable for her?? That could\u2019ve been terrible and I\u2019m sure as hell they would\u2019ve also blamed her for \u201cnot doing food suitable for their daughter\u201d.

Parenting, what is that?", "Thank you for the additional input! This restaurant is entirely dairy, gluten and nut-free - I had the same concerns with cross-contamination in a restaurant that serves gluten. Unfortunately as more people without celiac have decided to avoid gluten, I think some restaurants see it more as a \"preference\" than a requirement.", "Yes, it was really a shame.

NTA. I would just explain to all three of them that you were trying to take her allergies as seriously as possible and will either make something specific for her in the future or even ask her specifically if there is a restaurant or certain food she\u2019d like somewhere. Cooking a 5 course meal is a TON of work and a completely separate meal just for her would have been a lot of work. Maybe plan another meal that would work around her allergies for everyone to make her feel extra special? I\u2019m trying to focus on the child in the situation and not the fully grown adults who were very rude and decided to ruin your dinner party that you had cooked for instead of talking through their thoughts.", "OP said in another comment that her brother didn't even let her speak.

It's not a time where you can make a \"oh, did I or didn't I use that for the dairy-based sauce\". Even the coordination of dishing up the food has to be well coordinated. \n\nIn a professional kitchen this is a lot easier. In a house where someone with dietary needs lives it can be a little easier (steel or black utensils for cooking and serving \"regular\" food and coloured handles on utensils used for the dairy and nut free cooking).

Mom is TA.", "!!!!!!!!!!!", "My mother and sister had indulged in a bit of wine by that point so they had...some things to say - lol. It has honestly been a bit of a struggle connecting with Cheryl for all of us. We keep trying because we love my brother, but it's hard. We all got off on the wrong foot because Cheryl was Greg's boss when they met and that coupled with the age difference made my mom feel like Cheryl was taking advantage of him (and I didn't entirely disagree). So there's some history there, and this was just another issue to add to the pile.", "This. OP please dish", "Most parents of kids with severe dietary allergies would be grateful that the cook had removed the risk of cross-contamination, not mad that OP hadn't cooked two entirely separate five course meals without possible cross-contaminating two very common food ingredients.", "This is basically what I was going to write. \n\nOP, you are NTA, but the optics are bad. \n\nYou needed to let your brother know that with the size/complexity of the meal you were making, you had concerns about keeping Becca safe and were planning on ordering her a meal so there was no chance of cross contamination.

From the sounds of things the daughter was fine with the food so they ruined her evening as well.", "I can understand what you're saying. Thanks.", "I disagree. As a parent of a child with dairy and nut intolerances (they won't kill her but they can make her very sick, sometimes requiring the hospital) it is *MY* responsibility to contact the host to ensure she is being catered for. It's very surprising foods can be present (dairy in crisps / chips if you're in the USA for example). \n\nThe fact that her Mum didn't contact OP shows her ignorance and complete disregard for her daughter's safety. Unless you are well versed in feeding people with allergies, then how are you expected to know what's in and what's out?", "I completely disagree. OP seems to care more about the child\u2019s dietary needs than the parents. \n\nWith severe allergies, there is no way this was the first time her food was different than everyone else\u2019s.

I think I just need someone else in the kitchen to back me up and make sure I don't mess up the ingredients. The thought of making her sick makes me very anxious.", "Wait, she protected their kid as she was involved in cooking a five course meal for 12 people and you think she could handle a specialty meal on top of that and she is partly at fault?

Any parent of a child with food allergies would be calling the host to confirm food allergies and the menu. This just sounds like the wife was looking for a way to start drama.", "I could figure out how to put together a meal without any obvious wheat or dairy ingredients. Like, if someone just preferred not to eat wheat or dairy, I wouldn't mind accommodating that for a dinner. My concern really was with cross-contamination. I don't have a dishwasher, so I wash everything by hand. Obviously, I wash my dishes thoroughly, but I don't know if I could say I would bet someone's life on the thoroughness of my washing skills. The only way I would feel comfortable guaranteeing that my food was completely wheat and dairy free would be to deep clean my entire kitchen, use only freshly-bought ingredients (i.e. no baking powder, yeast, or anything else I'd used before), and buy bowls and utensils just for that purpose.", "Cross contamination in the kitchen would be an issue.", "I\u2019m pretty sure even cross contamination through utensils/cookware can cause illness, depending on the severity of it. I could be wrong.\n\nEdit for clarification: cookware/utensils previously used to cook all types of foods", "Because if the allergy is truly severe (like my SIL) then she would also have had to deep clean her kitchen and potentially use an entirely different set of pots and utensils than she does normally. That is not a reasonable ask when there are other acceptable alternatives.", "OP already explained; cross contamination. That can occur so easily. Using a chopping board you put toast on earlier in the day, having a spoon get a bit of flour on it from baking the day before, all sorts of things.

By age 9 (they're 12 now), both of my daughters understood that sometimes, they just can't eat whatever is on the table. You went out of your way to find a restaurant that could make something for her, something you didn't feel like you could do, and made sure she had something to eat. You didn't mention it, but you cooked a lot of food which can be so stressful no matter how much you enjoy cooking. I can't imagine cooking an additional, separate meal on top of that.

As an allergy parent I\u2019m surprised they would even want to let someone else cook for their child. If you don\u2019t regularly cook for someone with certain allergies it is a VERY difficult task.

You went above and beyond and if I were the one you were making food for, it would have made me feel special, included, and hugely appreciated.", "Cheryl would have blamed you either way.

As someone who has severe ADHD, I commend you for being self-aware enough to know that some of us don\u2019t have the executive functioning skills to not cross-contaminate. It was incredibly responsible. \n\nPart of navigating ourselves in a non-ADHD world is accommodating when we need to. \n\nYour brother and his wife HAVE to know that cooking for a keto or vegan diet is substantially different than for an allergy. Accidentally using a spoon that stirred meat sauce to stir vegan red sauce would probably make a vegan mad, but it wouldn\u2019t cause them to go into anaphylactic shock. \n\nLike, I have a mild seafood allergy. My husband microwaved seafood downstairs while I was upstairs and I still ended up with a sore throat. \n\nLike, you took the time to get a meal just for her.

My friend has a severe peanut allergy and I always try to make my food safe but also offer to order him something so that he never feels unsafe or not included eating in my home. I wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive myself if I tried my best but still hurt him. Better safe than sorry with these things.", "Look, this is easy. NTA. I worked in kitchens for 9 years and had to prepare all kinds of allergen free meals. I also love cooking and go all out when i can and I've had parties where someone has a severe gluten allergy and I tailor the whole menu around that one person. It ain't easy. It's also nerve wracking when you're not in a professional kitchen, where they can control things more readily than a home cook can. I appreciate where your brother and SIL are coming from in that everyone wants a special meal when you're a good cook, but they're asking too much. Planning and preparing  a whole special meal for a large group is a herculean task. Doing all of that and THEN trying to manage a separate meal for allergens is impossible for one person. Suggest your brother, SIL, and her daughter come over for a special meal that caters to her and let her help plan the menu. You can even suggest they all help prepare so they can get an idea of the effort you put in. It's a great bonding experience and hopefully it'll cool off the adults. You'll also be a rock star in the eyes of the daughter. Good luck!!", "So I have a kid with Celiac and I would be over the moon if someone took so much care. Only thing is it should be communicated first with parents. They should know, though, that if regular flour is used NO food from the kitchen is safe. Especially with her level of allergy. I don't have wheat flour in my house at all due to the airborne contamination risk.", "Not a way to treat his sister. Is he out of his mind?", "Just make it clear to her that your kitchen is not gluten free. And you are taking cross contamination issues seriously. \n\nBut better yet, talk to Becca. Include her in the process of picking out what she'd like to order for the next meal, and ask her if the previous food was acceptable or would prefer something from another place. It will make her feel special and included. And be honest with Becca and tell her that you don't want to make her sick if you accidentally mess up.", "Is a nibbling like a type of dessert? Sounds chocolatey.", "I agree it's weird they didn't contact her beforehand. I have a similar situation in my family and we usually discuss beforehand if there are enough safe things the host of the get together is making for the family member or if they should bring their own food.", "Exactly!  Unless you have professional training, you can screw up and not even realize it.  I really don\u2019t understand the logic of the parents.", "THIS. OP you totally went out of your way, both time wise and financially to make sure Becca had a good, safe meal. This is nothing like the AITA mashed potatoes debacle.", "You could ask your brother if he would have preferred you made the meal just the same for everybody, like Beca\u2019s food because eating keto and cross contaminate keto is not the same as cross contaminate for Beca because it can cause her a serious illness, even to die of food poisoning", "Right, I really don't understand their objections here--I think it's going above and beyond that the OP made sure her food was prepared in a safe kitchen even if she spent extra money on it. Other than they hyped Becca up for this meal.", "That's a really nice idea.", "It's also your job as a parent to temper your child's expectations in the face of their own limitations. \n\nWhy would they (a) assume that OP could make the food that their child required and (b) spend days hyping up said child when they haven't even confirmed that there's something there that she can eat? \n\nThey set her and themselves up for disappointment.", "And offer to bring something ourselves (I do it even for my kid with sensory issues). Who assumes others are going to make several separate meals??", "Ouch. In that case, they won't care for OP's reasoning anyway.", "Girl you did everything right. Why didn\u2019t the SIL volunteer to help clean so that the kitchen can be safe to make food for her daughter", "I\u2019m hypoglycemic so if I don\u2019t eat I get really, really sick but it\u2019s usually nothing close to celiac. I bring food with me almost everywhere I go, even to other people\u2019s houses, especially since I have texture issues. OP NTA, her brother but especially the kids mother, are giant AH\u2019s. Take care of your Fing kid.", "You could offer to cook it in their kitchen if you would be comfortable with that. Then you would know that there were no bad ingredients around.", "You don\u2019t have to do that, if you don\u2019t feel comfortable and the result of a mix up/mistake could be sickness or death for the kid - it\u2019s irresponsible of that child\u2019s parents to want you to. They are setting her up to have her allergies triggered. It\u2019s so easy to miss something, lots of ingredients you wouldn\u2019t think had gluten or dairy \u201cmay contain\u201d elements of either. \n\nThe reaction to your kindness in finding a restaurant that could provide a multi corse SAFE meal for her was so over the top and rude, could you imagine how bad it would be if you messed up and accidentally made the kid sick? The guilt alone would be terrible but the parents would make it 10 fold.", "Depending on your relationship to your SIL and her daughter, you could also offer to cook something with Becca, maybe a recipe SIL preapproved. That way you could vet all the ingredients and spend some time with Becca that could actually be really special and fun.", "Did they expect you to make a 5 course celebration dinner with no dairy or gluten? Or a second complete meal? I would invite them for a simple one dish meal once in a while, but couldn't imagine having to cook like that all the time. So glad I don't have to. We only have to leave out nuts in my household.", "At no point did I lay any fault on OP. I said I was between NAH and ultimately landed on NTA because of Greg's dramatic storm out. \n\nMy suggestion is merely if she values these relationships and wants to mend the fence, which she is obviously not obligated to do, I think it would be fairly easy to explain away this misunderstanding.", "Yeah, I agree with that. If you invite someone you already know has an allergy to certain foods, it\u2019s pretty much a given that you are accommodating them, I at least think it would be a dick move not to. That aside, I don\u2019t know what else could\u2019ve OP done in this situation. OP was not confident in maintaining that \u201csterile\u201d environment and the solution was to order something specifically catered for the girl. I wouldn\u2019t be mad at all, I don\u2019t know what the brother and wife are on.", "Yes, I don't mind accommodating people's food restrictions at all.  I would never want someone to come to my home for a meal and leave hungry.", "I feel like they're saying the wife seems to overreact and she is more incharge, nothing to do with gender", "You are smart to think about the cooking utensils - gluten sticks to wood, when I was diagnosed celiac I was also advised to throw out all wooden utensils/cutting boards/rolling pins. You'd have to deep clean any appliance also to be safe, shared toasters are dangerous and if you have say a convection oven, that'd be a possible source of contamination too. Their expectations are wildly unreasonable if they care about keeping the kiddo healthy.", "Seems like you actually cared more about her health than her parents did", "Yup and even depending on the person, your cook surfaces and residue in your kitchen sponges.", "No, they didn't say anything to her, other than that they were leaving. She looked really confused and kind of sad. I felt terrible.", "I mean, as an ex-kid, getting take out was always the more fun option until I had to pay for it myself.\n\nAs a person with allergies, I would prefer a completly safe option always over the novelty of food I don't know, because itching and wheezing don't make a meal more enjoyable.\n\nAnd as somebody with ADD I completly understand the fear of messing up something that could easily have severe medical consequences for a 9 year old, OP's alternative would totally be what I'd choosen given the option exists.\n\nSounds like that mommy likes attention and drama so she uses her daughter as an excuse to be outraged and Greg is sucking up to it instead of expecting her to respect normal social boundaries.", "Do they not know what goes into making a fancy five-course dinner? Why would they create drama and put a damper on a party for your parent's wedding anniversary because of disappointment over how you handled a child's special dietary needs?  WTF is wrong with them? Honestly, their response seems histrionic and self-centered. Reasonable adults would have spoken to you afterwards in private although its also true that reasonable adults would not have been offended.\n\nNTA\n\nYour solution for Becca was fine and motivated both by her safety and making sure she had something delicious.", "Absolutely this. I know a few people with celiac and they have to have basically separate kitchens. They don't use the same pots, pans, toaster, cutting boards, and of that because of how each cross contamination is with gluten.\n\nOP is super NTA for realising she couldn't do it safely, even without ADHD and being potentially forgetful. It's a serious allergy and she seems like the only one who took it seriously enough.", "Yeah I have adhd too and I accidentally do the wrong thing all the time. Also I forget things all the time, so much so that I\u2019ve had to come up with so many different work arounds in my life. I would be terrified of cooking for someone with an allergen because of how often I blank out on stuff. Like did I use this spoon in that sauce? Have I wiped this counter? And so on. I hope OP\u2019s family can be sympathetic, but a lot of people see executive dysfunction and forgetfulness as a moral failing.", "Not all allergies kill someone on the spot, but there are serious side affects when a person with celiac consumes gluten. There are three different cancers that only celiacs get, and making sure that they are very strict about their diet would be important.", "Yeah, by food allergy standards, celiac is generally incredibly mild. (Luckily, otherwise they'd all be dead, as gluton is in everything! It takes a long time realising people have celiacs)", "Celiac is not an allergy, it's an autoimmune disorder. In the moment it could give you a severe stomach ache but in the long run if you don't watch your diet carefully it can give you some pretty severe digestive issues as you get older.

Stuffing at Christmas was his big weakness.", "When I cook for my friend with celiac, I spend *hours* disinfecting my entire kitchen multiple times.

Celiac is no joke and I bake a lot so my entire kitchen is contaminated.", "I really don't understand, I see this a lot over Reddit threads.
