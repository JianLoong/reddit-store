A collection of the original set has been going around my family--those older dolls are sturdy and can survive the play of many little girls.", "NTA and I bet your niece is delighted. Sounds like your sister wanted a pristine collectible the poor kid might not have even been able to play with.", "NTA. Your sister is an entitled AH and too caught up in the optics of \u201cnewness\u201d to realize what her daughter actually wants. I\u2019ll bet your sister wanted to brag to people that her daughter had one of the newest dolls. \n\nIt\u2019s so sweet that you got her the specific doll she actually wanted most, plus more, because you\u2019d saved that money for her. I expect your niece is thrilled, though your sister probably won\u2019t ever admit it.", "Not an asshole. In fact, you sound like a person that\u2019s going to do pretty well in life.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds awesome. Maybe your sister doesn\u2019t spend any time with her own child, but most 7 year olds raised properly are happier with multiple (inexpensive) items than 1 (expensive) item. \n\nOnly the horribly raised 7 year olds will pitch a fit over packaging or even notice if something is \u201cused\u201d", "NTA.\n\nWhile I have no idea what an American Girl Doll costs, what you did was priceless. DIY gifts mean much more than just handing over your card to someone for a gift. You put in a lot of work for these gifts and it could have meant a lot to your niece. Your sister is teaching her to be an entitled princess who will only appreciate shiny baubles and things with a high price tag instead of things that are a result of love and effort.\n\nThat's a real shame.", "NTA. Your sister overreacted and is being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nSorry but you really are the greatest uncle ever this is so cool!!!", "NTA it sounds like you\u2019re a fantastic uncle!!", "NTA. What a sweet gift! Next time, give your gift to your niece when your sister isn't around and find out what SHE feels about it. Here it just seems like your sister wanted the cache of an expensive toy, missing the point of both the effort you put in and how her daughter would want to play with them.", "NTA. For Christmas this year see if there's an American Girl Cafe near you and take your niece and her doll. The doll can bring a friend to keep you company. Have some tea and overpriced food, maybe pick out a new outfit, and don't take a single picture because I'm pretty sure your sister wants some sort of Instagram-perfect outing.\n\nYou kept dolls out of landfills AND made your niece happy. Maybe next time you should buy another \"vintage\" doll and teach her how to fix them up!", "NTA! You\u2019re the greatest uncle ever and I\u2019m sure your niece loves the dolls! You just single handedly created a new family heirloom that will be loved by future generations to come! Your sister\u2019s reaction is weird.", "NTA!! In fact, I think you're the greatest Uncle ever, and your niece is lucky to have you! You were thoughtful, and put in hardwork to create something she shared with you. Good job, you did amazing. Your sister sucks.", "NTA- You're an amazing uncle! Not only did you know what your niece likes, but you saved up enough to buy 6 secondhand ones instead of 1 new one, and proceeded to actually fix them up pretty amazingly it sounds like! Also, it's the one who's receiving the gifts the opinion matters and apparently your niece loves them!", "NTA\n\nYour sister wanted the dolls for herself?", "First off, nta. Second, duuude that's such an amazing idea. My daughter and I follow a doll creator/remaker on Youtube and the whole purpose is to keep dolls out of the landfills. Maybe you guys can do the project together sometime with clothes/props/accessories. I'm sure she loved having friends for her doll versus having a lonely doll. Take that from a girl's mom. My daughter rather have two used dolls than new because they get to go on a new adventure together", "NTA - But I'm sorry for you that your sister is. I'm sure you niece doesn't know the difference. All she knows is that her uncle got her 6 American Girl Dolls! And I'm sure that she was overjoyed by this. Your sister's problem is that she's an asshole who wanted her kid not to play with the doll but instead save it as a collectible. I think that you are a great uncle, not only did you spend your money on exactly what she wanted but you got her 6 different kinds but you put a lot of time and effort into this as well.", "NTA. Your sister has some issues. Not only was that incredibly thoughtful, it\u2019s also eco-friendly. Ignore her. She can\u2019t demand how you gift things to your niece.", "Nta ofc the kid is going to want SIX dolls instead of 1!  Mom is out of her mind.  And now you have an easy gift until she outgrows them- doll clothes and stuff.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a little biased, I run a hobby shop that deals heavily with old toys, but you went out of your way to find your niece's out of production favorite, on top of still spending your original intention instead of trying to save a few bucks, on top of an attempt to restore the dolls to their original status. That's actually showing you care.", "NTA. My mother finds these dolls for super cheap, repairs them , finds outfits, and then donates them to kids at Christmas time. Those dolls are crazy expensive!", "Aww, this is incredibly sweet of you. NTA at all! I'm sorry your sister feels that way. I hope she didn't warp your niece's feelings about them. You went above and beyond to get something your niece wanted that isn't even made anymore and went through the effort of restoring them. Man... and six of them? That's a lot of work.", "NTA\n\nThat is an amazing gift for a little girl.", "NTA, that's an awesome thing you did and I bet she absolutely loves them.  I have a 5 yo daughter and would definitely do the same thing if she was into those.  I've given my kids used toys before and they didn't notice or care.  I wish more people would reuse toys like this, it would keep a shit ton of plastic out of the landfills.", "NTA, your nice loved them. That's all that matters. Your sister is acting incredibly entitled. You put hard work into restoring and making the dolls!", "NTA and your sister sounds like a snob.", "your present sounds amazing! big nta", "NTA\n\nYour sister is TA. She didn't apreciate you getting not one but six of the dolls her daughter loves. Everyone has their budget, as well as you have yours. I don't know how much this doll costs (I'm not from the USA) but what I know it's your sister is being rude and inconsiderate towards you.", "Yta well intention but missing the mark. People have different connotations about second hand stuff. You should have asked your sister if it was ok.\n\nThis is covered in The Joy Luck Club movie. Someone gives the Chinese girl a used chess set and her mom gets mad. Asians that I know including me do not wear second hand clothes. We just don\u2019t. I find it gross. I had an Asian friend get a bag full of second hand clothes from her white bf in college. She was like ewww and returned them for cash.", "NTA: 6 used is better than \n1 new for a kid. This way she can make stories with multiple of them. AG dolls hold up super well too. 7 year olds aren't all about the unboxing experience.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your sister was way more into the perceived \"status\" thing of American Girl than actually making her kid happy.", "NTA and in fact, the opposite.  You ARE an amazing uncle!  Your sister is not just a raging AH but a terrible parent.  She's going to let her bs leak out all over what should've been an incredible bonding experience between you and your niece and a gift she would remember forever.\n\nHas your sister always been this shallow, negative, and mean?", "NTA.  The fact that your sister seems far more concerned about something being \"new\" vs secondhand and is ignoring the actual thought and effort you put in is really telling.  The idea that something used doesn't belong to her is also...really weird?  \n\nAs long as your niece loved them then that's what really matters here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also appreciate all the dresses my mom sewed for my dolls. I even had clothes I could swap with the doll that was as big as myself once (she taught me how to walk). What I don't remember is unpacking any of them, let alone how the boxes even looked like. I guarantee you, your niece will be the coolest of all her american girl girl friends since she now has a doll of a character that wasn't even dollified (aka limited edition one of a kind).\nAnd if you enjoy customizing dolls maybe that could be a hobby you can share with your niece.

I had one growing up though and played with her all the time, they're a lot more durable than people think.", "Yep and unfortunately my mom was one of those moms who thought because it said limited edition or collector's edition on a Barbie box it meant it would be worth lots of money one day. During Christmas I would be gifted a holiday Barbie but was not allowed to open or play with it. There was a special edition Easter Barbie (1996) I got in my Easter basket. My mom was upset the next day when she caught me with it out of the box. I carefully pulled it out so it could be put back and thought that would be good enough if I played with it carefully. I was 5 years old. On Amazon right now the same Easter Barbie is on sale in box for under $30. \n\nAs an adult now I would never do that to my child.
