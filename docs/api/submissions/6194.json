This person obviously cares for your son and his well being.  I\u2019m a child psychologist.  I test children for a living.  There are many conditions in very young children which manifest as behaviors commonly associated with autism and autism spectrum disorders.  These include hearing impairments, auditory/language processing deficits, severe ADHD, significant developmental delay, and verbal learning disabilities just to name a few.  When they test for autism, they will also test ALL of these areas to see if there are deficits in any of them.  I am not saying your bf is correct, but if your son has any delays or deficits in any area, early intervention is key in helping him to improve in those areas.", "YTA \n\nHave you ever considered the possibility? My sister acted the same way about my nephew. After many years of struggling, he was finally diagnosed at 8. People kept suggesting to her that he needed testing.

Have you done any research into the symptoms of autism at a young age?\n\nYour boyfriend seems genuinely concerned, and you're just brushing him off and getting offended when he brings up his concerns.

Get. Him. Tested.\n\nAnd you need to work on how you handle disagreements. It sounds like your bf presented a perfectly valid case for getting tested.

Do you have the slightest clue how common it is? Your child isn\u2019t normal, and I don\u2019t mean that rudely. Not a single person on earth is \u201cnormal\u201d. To be honest though, reason this i it comes across as if you are in denial that something could be a little different- and that\u2019s okay. If your son has autism or he would be a candidate for extra services, many in home, that can help him. \n\nMy cousin is autistic, went through mainstream classes from pre-k to graduation. Now goes to community college and holds employment. You have such a discriminatory view and that honestly isn\u2019t okay. Please listen to your bf and hear his reasoning for saying it. He obviously sees something there, and many parents wear rose color glasses and can not witness and accept what others see. We don\u2019t want for our child to face any type of barrier, but if you don\u2019t at least get an eval that willbe a hindsight moment of something happens down the line.

How much time on a daily/weekly basis does he spend with your son?\n\nThe fact that he prefaced his concern with a \"don't be mad\" hints that your son's reluctance to social has been going on for quite awhile. Another commenter pointed out that your son growing up during the major parts of the pandemic may play a part in his social development. However, I don't think your boyfriend is out of line for bringing up concerns. More people are being educated on early signs of neuro-divergent behaviors that he may feel he recognizes in your son. Seeing as you now live together, this is a person that you trust to care about your kid's well being. In your boyfriend's eyes, he may be trying to get ahead of potential developmental differences and make that no matter the result your kid will always has access to resources to help navigate him through a very neuro-typical favoring world. You definitely overreacted and even if you don't feel like there's a possibility that your son is on the spectrum, you could have handled the conversation in a calmer, more adult manner.\n\nEdit: with just the original story, I'm leaning towards YTA or No Assholes Here.", "YTA if he is showing autistic tendencies then you should definitely get him tested. That way you can start properly learning and getting the support he\u2019s going to need and if he\u2019s not autistic, no harm no foul.

There are soooooo many parents out there who refuse to acknowledge that something might be off with their kid, to the detriment of the kid. Don\u2019t be that kind of mom.", "OP doesn't exactly sound like mom of the year. Check out her profile. She was asking for advice on getting a fake test for a court ordered drug test just 2 years ago, when the kid was 2. She does not have this child's best interests in mind in ANY way.", "YTA.  What possible motivation would your BF have to encourage you to get your son evaluated?  Do you think he enjoys arguing with you?  No, OP, your BF does not want to upset you - he is genuinely concerned. \n\nPlease talk to your son\u2019s pediatrician about testing.  If the test shows nothing, then so what?  You wasted a little bit of time while your son thought he was playing games.  But if the test shows he is on the spectrum then he gets early intervention and becomes an even happier little boy.\n\nThink carefully:  While the 3 of you were playing \u201ckitchen\u201d did your son offer you any food?  Does he engage in make believe play, where his toys become his friends or the characters in a stories?  When you read story books, can he tell you how the central character is feeling and why?  \n\nUnless you see a lot of children, the signs of mild autism are easy to miss.  Don\u2019t be afraid to find out.  Good luck to you all.", "YTA. Most people start noticing symptoms of autism around his age. In my area the wait list to get tested is sadly about 2 years. I don't know what it is else where. If there's any concerns it's important to get on that wait list asap. It can also mean if he has it it would take that much longer to get accomodations in school. I don't understand why you are so upset by some one suggesting your kid may have autism. I know you say you have nothing against Autism but getting upset over the suggestion would paint a different picture. Not interacting with children his own age is a very common symptom of autism. Even if he has very mild autism it can still be beneficial for the individual to understand why he's different than others. I recently discovered personally I might have mild autism and mask very well and it's why I always grew up feeling different from my peers without being able to fully figure out why. It lead to a lot of emotional issues as a teen. If I would have been diagnosed at a young age it wouldn't have lead to accommodations but it would have lead to me understanding sooner why I always felt disconnected to peers and that would've made a big difference for me to have simply known. It would have also meant I'd be able to get treatment to help me recognize when I do something socially rude that I didn't realize vs me as an adult trying to figure it out on my own. There's nothing wrong with being put on a wait-list just to make sure. It's better to be wrong in this case than not even trying", "YTA Getting your son tested is not going to harm him or you. Instead of pretending everything is normal because that is what makes you comfortable, have your son tested. The sooner they catch any abnormalities the better the outcome. Burying your head in the sand is not going to help your son at all. At least your BF cares about your son. He is not getting his jollies by suggesting your son get tested.\n\nIt is about getting your son the help he needs, not about you pretending everything is fine for your own benefit.\n\nETA: Is your ego so much more important than arranging a harmless test?", "YTA \n\nPandemic babies do have a different outlook and social abilities. \n\nBut\u2026.. testing is not such a bad idea. If you son isn\u2019t interacting with other kids it could be for a raft of reasons. \n\nGetting him tested and some medical advice is never a bad thing! \n\nThere is also second opinions.", "In case you\u2019re worried that an autism diagnosis is somehow life ruining, let me assure you that it is absolutely not. My kid was evaluated when they were 4 on the advice of their preschool teacher who was concerned about their social skills. We had a diagnosis of what was then called Asperger\u2019s in the spring before kindergarten. My kid also has social anxiety, a common comorbidity with autism. They had accommodations K-12 as well as various services and therapy for the anxiety outside of school.   \n\n\nI am absolutely convinced that my kid is happier and more successful, socially, academically and professionally, because they got the help they needed. It was also tremendously helpful to both me and my husband to have the diagnosis because it allowed us to understand certain behaviors and issues. My kid graduated with honors from an excellent college, has a high paying professional job they like in field well known for having lots of people on the spectrum and has good friends.  Early diagnosis and appropriate services made that possible.\n\nLook at it this way. Which would be worse? You put in some time and effort on getting an evaluation, your son spends some time talking to and being observed by some friendly adults and it turns out your son is entirely neurotypical and there\u2019s no diagnosis of any kind warranted. Or there\u2018s no evaluation, an actual issue is missed and your son misses out on the help that would make a positive difference in his life. And please don\u2019t say you\u2019ll wait and see if there are real problems that crop up. Many things are diagnosable right now, including autism, and the earlier a kid starts getting help, the better. A year or two will matter.", "I got my autism diagnosis at 35. I wish it had happened (light) YEARS earlier. Would have made my life so much easier. \nThere is nothing harmful for testing your son.

What does a fight with your husband have to do with canceling New Years!?", "Info: is not wanting to interact with other children the only sign?  How\u2019s his eye contact, responding to his name, expressing his own feelings?  Does he participate in pretend play?  How\u2019s his speech?  How is he with routine change?", "As someone with autism I must say, Im not happy with your tone, or your boyfriends. Autism doesn't mean something is wrong. It means your brain works different than most peoples. It includes a strong logic which can come in handy in many ways. I love being around many autistic people with the same humor and logic.\n\nIt does mean the world is not built right for you in many ways, though it also has benefits. Having an autism diagnosis has enabled me to understand myself better. It helped my parents coach me true life better. For example, my dad stopped calling \"Dinner\" out of no where, instead he called \"Dinner in 5 min\" followed by a reminder after 5 minutes. Time to transition is really nice.\n\nI learned to understand the world bit by bit. I learned to understand sytuations by comparing to earlier situations that I already understood. I am now an adult with a good social life, a nice job and a fairly strong insight in social interactions. My parents would talk me trough situations afterwarts sometimes, it helped me get that early database of comparison material (for example, knowing \"screaming people can be angry or scared but they can alternatively be exited\" is knowledge needed to judge some situations). \n\nYour bf choice harsh words and there are many stereotypes floating around, so I won't blame you for getting defensive. But do educate yourself. You should see an autism diagnosis or suspision as a set of  tricks (easially googlable) that if it fits your child could help you help your child and could help your child understand and deal with the world.", ">My son is very intelligent for his age but its social at all. He doesnt like to play with other kids which i know is a phase hes very shy\n\n This does not sound like normal four-year-old behavior to me.\n\nWorst case, he gets tested and it comes back negative.

It could be genuine concern from your bf or pathologising a child's unfavored behavior.

If he just has social anxiety, he can still get help from professionals", "Your reaction is why YTA, take ur judgement already", "You should delete this comment or the \u201cweed testing\u201d comment.  New York legalized weed starting today. You should also have your boy screened for autism imo.", "What annoys me about all these posts, and about your bf assumptions, is this jump to \u201che\u2019s antisocial, he must be on the spectrum\u201d. Sure, an Autism diagnosis is pretty commonplace in the US currently, but not wanting to play with other children is not even a symptom of ASD. If he makes eye contact, responds to his name, doesn\u2019t stim, etc than there\u2019s no reason to rush to that particular idea. \n\nDoes he see a pediatrician? Next time you go for a check up, mention the anti social nature and see what they think. If you, his teachers, and his biological father are all saying he\u2019s just shy, he is probably shy. \n\nI come at this from a different perspective because I was a bit of a lab rat child who got tested for everything. There\u2019s no harm in talking to some experts, but I\u2019ll vehemently disagree that there\u2019s no harm in having your child tested for everything until you get a diagnosis. It was the 80\u2019s and things were different then, but my parents and doctors made decisions about my physical health based on my IQ. It wasn\u2019t ethical.  And I\u2019m still dealing with it in therapy now.

He may be seeing something you\u2019re not or seeing something you don\u2019t want to see. Does he have any experience with autism or people with autism? What behaviors does your son exhibit that makes him think autism is a possibility? \n\nAnd while it may not be uplifting to hear, you seemed to be very quick to get defensive and shut it down without even considering the possibility.  At least talk to your sons teacher and his pediatrician and be honest. They\u2019ll be able to tell you if his behaviors are inherent to his age or require further evaluation.", "Your boyfriend suddenly telling you there's something wrong with your kid out of left field like that and then trying to insist you get him tested is really odd.", "As an autistic father with autistic kids, please don\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do to define *my* disability.", "So he\u2019s not the father.

If someone constantly was telling you something is wrong with your child you\u2019d take offense to it as well.", "I'm autistic too, and I was just trying to kindly let you know about this in case you didn't know. A lot of us really dislike this terminology, and I personally always want to know if I'm using out-dated terms. Of course it's fine if you want to use it for yourself (but you didn't, and who knows, maybe your kids feel differently).", "He's not trying to diagnose.  He suggested she speak to a professional about any possible issues. She completely over reacted to his concern for the child.", "No.  What I did was take my son in to be tested so that he could get the therapy and help he and us as his parents needed.   Stop with the b/s.  Consider that it would be in your son's best interest if he needs actual help.  And they know so much more than they did in early 2000's.", "I have kids, and my first response would be to get them tested. I can tell you from experience that it's far worse to realize that your child is different and needs help in some areas but have people around you insist they don't.
