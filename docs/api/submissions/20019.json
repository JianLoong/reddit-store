I have an unemployed brother (33) living in a neighboring country he has three kids (10, 3, 1.25) with three different women, and have a fourth on the way with the third woman. They are all financially dependent on my mom, my mom has guilted me into sending them over $5k ( we are living below the poverty line here in the US, so that's a ton of money to me.)\n\nA few nights ago, I got a call from my brother's girlfriend asking me to be her child's godmother which in our culture means that if the parents are struggling you're partially or entirely responsible for the child, I politely declined. She insisted and told me about their financial situation, to which I responded that they shouldn't have a child because they can't afford it, she said that there was nothing she could do about it, and I responded with something along the lines of \"maybe use contraceptives, or don't have sex at all, or since it's too late for those just abort it, I don't know, there are so many ways to not have a child.\" I guess she told my mom about our conversation, and my mom got mad at me for suggesting such an abomination, I told her that they were probably having unmarried intercourse often, so an abortion wouldn't make that much of a  difference, she is now livid at me.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nClarifications:\n\nI was saving the 5k for school, I sent it to my brother as part payment for a new car because he was going to do taxi to earn money, (he claimed that the car he bought malfunctioned but I think he scammed me, I think my mom is still being scammed). That was the last time I sent them money (I was 18), but I still get messages from them asking for money despite the fact that my mom is regularly sending them money.\n\nMy mom found him multiple jobs for him, he left all of them within a week saying they were too hard. \n\nMy mom's money is her money, she can do what she wants with it. however she's very old and already has some mobility issues, I know I will be fully financially responsible for her because she sends my brother all the money she makes, she doesn't have a penny saved.", "created_utc": 1687134573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14czptt/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_she_shouldve_aborted/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like you're forcing her to get one. Also, don't keep handing over money if you don't have the financial stability to do so.

No should have been the end of it.

If your mom wants to give them her money - she has every right to give.", "YTA", "YTA. That really was not an appropriate comment for you to make since it\u2019s your brother\u2019s family and they get to make their own choices. I do understand why their dependence on your mom would frustrate you, and also it does sound like it is irresponsible of them to have another baby, but these are both things that aren\u2019t really your business and are definitely out of your control. It was totally within your right to politely decline being a god parent, but it would have been best just to leave it at that", "ESH, but mostly your brother's incredibly irresponsible behavior.\n\nSuggesting that a woman abort her baby, even if she's trying to manipulate you into subsidizing said baby, is pretty disturbing.\n\nBut running around the countryside having unprotected sex with a whole bunch of women and fathering a whole lot of children he can't afford, is much, much worse.\n\nWhat, has your brother never heard of the condom or spermicidal gels?  (I hear they cut down on unwanted pregnancies.  Just saying.)  Has he never heard of the internet, where people can look for jobs?  (I understand that when you don't have money to support all the kids you've fathered, if you get a job, you're suddenly solvent.)\n\nYou don't have to be the godmother; don't do it.  In this situation, it's not an honor, it's a shakedown.\n\nDon't send another red cent.  Not one penny.  If the neighboring country is Canada, they have social services.  I would suggest that your brother and his many girlfriends make an appointment.\n\nYour mother is enabling your brother's irresponsibility.  Don't join her.  Put money into your own future, which includes the possibility of needing to help out your mom when she's elderly when her funds are depleted from helping irresponsible brother.\n\nThe 5K you've already sent is 5K too much.  Brother needs to work.  Cut him off.  Cut off the GF's who neither insisted upon condoms nor got birth control for themselves.  It's a mess, but it's not your mess.\n\nGo forth and have your own life and career and nuclear family without regard to your brother's chaos.  Encourage your mother to stop subsidizing his irresponsibility.  End this.\n\nNTA\n\nP.S.  Congrats on entering college only 4 years after coming to the U.S. when English wasn't your native language!  Bravo!
