They are all financially dependent on my mom, my mom has guilted me into sending them over $5k ( we are living below the poverty line here in the US, so that's a ton of money to me.)\n\nA few nights ago, I got a call from my brother's girlfriend asking me to be her child's godmother which in our culture means that if the parents are struggling you're partially or entirely responsible for the child, I politely declined. She insisted and told me about their financial situation, to which I responded that they shouldn't have a child because they can't afford it, she said that there was nothing she could do about it, and I responded with something along the lines of \"maybe use contraceptives, or don't have sex at all, or since it's too late for those just abort it, I don't know, there are so many ways to not have a child.\" I guess she told my mom about our conversation, and my mom got mad at me for suggesting such an abomination, I told her that they were probably having unmarried intercourse often, so an abortion wouldn't make that much of a  difference, she is now livid at me.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nClarifications:\n\nHe lives in a country neighboring our home country, not the US.\n\nI was saving the 5k for school, I sent it to my brother as part payment for a new car because he was going to do taxi to earn money, (he claimed that the car he bought malfunctioned but I think he scammed me, I think my mom is still being scammed). That was the last time I sent them money (I was 18), but I still get messages from them asking for money despite the fact that my mom is regularly sending them money.\n\nMy mom found him multiple jobs for him, he left all of them within a week saying they were too hard.\n\nMy mom's money is her money, she can do what she wants with it. however she's very old and already has some mobility issues, I know I will be fully financially responsible for her because she sends my brother all the money she makes, she doesn't have a penny saved.", "created_utc": 1687134573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14czptt/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_she_shouldve_aborted/", "score": 401, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
