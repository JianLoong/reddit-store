He may decide that he will try new foods to lessen the burden on himself, and that would be great.

Or he may start bringing his own food places.  Also fine.\n\nBut you're right: it's time for him to take the lead here and decide how he wants to manage his food going forward.  He's old enough to do this himself, and this is going to be something he has to manage in adulthood personally if he remains a picky eater.  Besides reminding him as he learns that this is something he needs to address possibly with pre-planning if he chooses, leaving this to him is completely appropriate.\n\nEven kids with medical reasons for avoiding foods will start to manage their own diets at this age.

So you're not making them food, or even making choices for them, but helping them think through the possibilities, and come up with strategies - ie, if there is maybe a side dish or something that they could fill up on, or maybe they want to brink snacks with them, or is there a place nearby so they can duck out and buy something more to their liking?

It took me literal years that some of the foods I don\u2019t like are because I\u2019m sensitive to them. For instance, I\u2019ve never liked pancakes very much, and it took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that I don\u2019t like pancakes because maple syrup gives me a stomachache. I can eat pancakes without maple syrup just fine, but over a decade of solely eating them with maple syrup has kind of ruined them for me.

No matter where I go to eat, I can always count on liking the chicken nuggets. They\u2019re consistently enjoyable with no gross textures or anything of the like.", "Chicken nuggets are great I think because they're consistent, so have protein, and are also just really easy. If you just have frozen ones you can pop them in the oven or even the micro if you're low on time, don't have an easy to access pan, or are low energy for whatever reason. You don't have to worry about the lack of consistency with things like fresh foods, but you also don't have to put too much effort into making it which can be helpful for making stuff to take on the go. Other safe foods for me are not typically that difficult to make, but they do require some level of prep. Chicken nuggets though, they're fast, they're consistent, they're tasty, they're easily available and common, and I wouldn't call them the best health wise but they do have protein which can be difficult to get when you're limited in what you're eating. So, I imagine for most people it's a combination of access and introduction to them as well as how simple they are, not only is the texture consistent but often the flavour is as well, and the flavour is not like paired with other stuff either- which I am currently fine with most foods mixing but I know that for a lot of people who have issues with food, different textures and/or flavours mixing is a big no no", "Definitely could be. It could also just be a common example, or go to safe food because it\u2019s cheapish and accessible. But there are other things, crackers, noodles, packaged foods that all have the same long shelf life, easy to get, predictability. \nIt could also be a consequence of food deserts and the like", "It is possible that they're spoiled ig, but I also don't really think we should downplay some of the things that goes into kids viewed as picky eaters. Lots of people who are picky eaters don't just choose to not eat other things because they aren't big fans of them, it can be legitimately distressing to eat those things because of either texture or flavour. For some picky eaters, they would literally rather just not eat for days then have to eat the foods that distress them. Because again, it isn't just a dislike, it's a genuine revulsion that is not that easily controllable. I am a picky eater in many ways, being said I am not limited to just chicken nuggets, but there's still a lot of things I will not and can not eat. I am trying to get over some of those, slowly introducing sea food is a thing I am working in right now, but that is also a thing I have been working on for years and I can still only eat shrimp regularly but doing so still causes some stress, I've eaten fish like twice but couldn't finish it. Historically though eating it would freak me out to the point where it would make me throw up, and I wouldn't be able to eat for a bit after because of how distressed I was. I still can't eat carrots in most situations (I can in some soups and I don't mind carrot cake) cause the texture and flavour will freak me out to a degree that to basically everyone is considered unreasonable. These are just liked two examples, but I do have issues with other foods too, and I know a bunch of other people who for them not eating stuff isn't just a preference thing, it's a this will cause intense amount soft unbearable distress thing.", "Back in the day,  the only shape was oval...\n\nAnd I had the oval that was skin and gristle...I don't know about the other shapes because of the oval skin and gristle...never had it again.", "I\u2019m a picky eater due to OCD.

My parents were born on a farm with no electricity or running water and grew the bulk of their own food through the Great Depression- they will quite literally eat everything and anything.
