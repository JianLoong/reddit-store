He may decide that he will try new foods to lessen the burden on himself, and that would be great.

Or he may start bringing his own food places.  Also fine.\n\nBut you're right: it's time for him to take the lead here and decide how he wants to manage his food going forward.  He's old enough to do this himself, and this is going to be something he has to manage in adulthood personally if he remains a picky eater.  Besides reminding him as he learns that this is something he needs to address possibly with pre-planning if he chooses, leaving this to him is completely appropriate.\n\nEven kids with medical reasons for avoiding foods will start to manage their own diets at this age.

So you're not making them food, or even making choices for them, but helping them think through the possibilities, and come up with strategies - ie, if there is maybe a side dish or something that they could fill up on, or maybe they want to brink snacks with them, or is there a place nearby so they can duck out and buy something more to their liking?

If you just have frozen ones you can pop them in the oven or even the micro if you're low on time, don't have an easy to access pan, or are low energy for whatever reason. You don't have to worry about the lack of consistency with things like fresh foods, but you also don't have to put too much effort into making it which can be helpful for making stuff to take on the go. Other safe foods for me are not typically that difficult to make, but they do require some level of prep. Chicken nuggets though, they're fast, they're consistent, they're tasty, they're easily available and common, and I wouldn't call them the best health wise but they do have protein which can be difficult to get when you're limited in what you're eating. So, I imagine for most people it's a combination of access and introduction to them as well as how simple they are, not only is the texture consistent but often the flavour is as well, and the flavour is not like paired with other stuff either- which I am currently fine with most foods mixing but I know that for a lot of people who have issues with food, different textures and/or flavours mixing is a big no no", "Definitely could be.

Because again, it isn't just a dislike, it's a genuine revulsion that is not that easily controllable.

I am trying to get over some of those, slowly introducing sea food is a thing I am working in right now, but that is also a thing I have been working on for years and I can still only eat shrimp regularly but doing so still causes some stress, I've eaten fish like twice but couldn't finish it. Historically though eating it would freak me out to the point where it would make me throw up, and I wouldn't be able to eat for a bit after because of how distressed I was. I still can't eat carrots in most situations (I can in some soups and I don't mind carrot cake) cause the texture and flavour will freak me out to a degree that to basically everyone is considered unreasonable.

I was not in the \u201cdanger\u201d zone of underweight (because when I did eat, it was breads and desserts), but I ate so poorly, my feet turned blue, and I would go blind for a few seconds standing up. I was constantly light-headed and weak and had trouble concentrating in school. Finally I was diagnosed with ARFID. But I was exhausted with it by then, I gave up and said I wanted the the relief of either a feeding tube or death. As a result I ended up in the Emily Program eating disorder residential care for 3 weeks, and partial hospitalization for months after.\n\nThings I wish more people understood:\n* boys and men can have eating disorders, not just girls and women\n* ARFID exists and can be a serious disorder. Does your body care if the missed meals are due to body image or due to sensory avoidance? The consequences are the same.\n* Eating disorders are a serious and sometimes deadly form of mental illness. Even if it doesn\u2019t kill you or damage your organs, it sucks away quality of life. Being constantly light-headed and weak sucks.\n* Feeding yourself is HARD. Commenters are talking like it\u2019s common sense. But it is a combination of so many skills, like nutrition, time and money management, meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking, and portioning. I would not expect a neurotypical kid barely out of middle school to have mastery of all of these skills instinctively, let alone if he were neurodivergent.\n\nHere are some tips that may help:\n* Make sure he takes a daily multivitamin to avoid a nutrition deficiency\n* Help him calculate how many calories he needs per day, versus how many he actually eats and burns.\n* Teach him about macro and micro nutrients. Balance protein/fat/carb foods to get consistent energy continuously. Teach him about micronutrients and warning signs of deficiency.\n* If he misses or does not finish the meal, he can have a meal replacement shake (The Emily Program gave us 1 Ensure or Boost for an incomplete meal, and 2 for a skipped meal. They called it \u201cboosting\u201d)\n* Teach him how to look for new recipes, plan meals, shop for ingredients, cook for himself, and plate up appropriate portions.\n* Encourage him to have back-up \u201csafe foods\u201d like protein bars. Bring them to events with food. Keep them in the bedside table, the backpack, or the car.\n* Teach distress tolerance skills so he is equipped to challenge \u201cunsafe foods\u201d. Talking through the reasons he doesn\u2019t want to eat something (is he scared of getting sick?) Distraction with conversation or music or TV. Holding an ice pack or hot pack. Square breathing.

I'm am EXTREMELY adventurous eater now after being a chef for a couple decades but shit, chicken nuggets are one of my biggest triggers for unpleasant textures and I wouldn't even eat them as a kid.", "yeah it must just be an excuse. nuggets are incredibly inconsistent and i've had some absolutely foul ones over the years", "Mmhmm. Sure.", "A kid his age doesn\u2019t know how to pack a lunch?", "She\u2019s not telling him to grocery shop, just to make himself a sandwich.", "Yep. And some people just need more support. It's a pleasure helping young people gain new skills even if it's time consuming. \n\nOP isn't wrong to want him to pack his own food. But I don't think teaching him is a huge ask. Any quality time with your kids is pretty rad.", "This is what I'm talking about, either anxiety related to eating or sensory issues related to eating unfamiliar or uncomfortable foods are likely involved.  I admit to using \"food insecurity\" inappropriately as a shortcut. Once anxiety enters the picture, flexibility and ability to think about the problem rationally and come up with solutions is reduced, along with willingness to accept unfamiliar solutions. Nobody is helped by telling the parents they were wrong to \"coddle\" their kid. Just cutting out support first remove the need for support. Taking steps to recognize the components of the problem and teach the kid to deal with the situation themselves is useful. If the kid is spoiled and just wants to be catered to, he may decide it's easier to eat what's offered than go through all the steps himself. If the kid is anxious or sensory averse, you've given him the tools to manage and cope with his issue, and to realize how much it impacts himself and others. He may even realize it's time to seek professional help. Isn't teaching your kids to be functioning adults the goal of parenting?", "Do you have ADHD? My ADHD causes me to do this.", "Oh heaven forbid a person wear clothing that fits their body!", "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t even give them the choice. People won\u2019t want to hire you or date you if you can\u2019t put on clean clothes that fit you properly and regardless of your opinion about it, this is the society we live in. I didn\u2019t make the rules but this is how it is. Once you get past age 20 you\u2019re going to have a harder time finding adult friends and girlfriends that want to hang out with your grubby ass. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t always have a choice in what I wear to certain events. Tough luck. Wear clean clothes or have a consequence. It\u2019s not a choice. You don\u2019t get to stay home and game. You either dress yourself like a functional human being and join the family or I\u2019m changing all the passwords to the Wi-Fi and taking the remotes with me. And you don\u2019t get them back tomorrow either.", "One of the high schoolers I used to work with weaponized their diabetes to get out of work. \n\nI worry what will happen when they're out in the world--you think your boss is going to just let you not do your job because you shoved five candy bars in your mouth and your blood sugar is too high and mommy and daddy aren't answering their phone to tell you how much insulin to take? You won't have that job long.", "its \"idiotic\" to prevent food waste and make kids understand how fortunate they are to not worry about starvation or malnourishment?", "Because they make it other people's problem! You can eat or not eat whatever you want, but when you're an adult or close and everyone has to plan around you because you only like 2 foods, it's going to get really old really fast", "People assign morality to food for some reason. And people look at a picky kid as a failing of the parents, see all the comments here blaming mom for \" enabling \". \n\nJust let people eat or not eat what they like. Everything is so fortified that no one is going to be malnourished. Provide options and don't force anything.", "Nothing's wrong.\n\nThe issue that ke is with pushing those highly processed \"kid friendly\" foods like fish fingers and chicken nuggets and other crap like that. Those don't actually need to exist in a household at all. A kid might be picky but they'll find *something* to eat; if they're picky and are presented with that crap as the easy alternative, they'll default to that.\n\nLike, if you don't present this option kid will just eat what they can from what's offered. Maybe they'll have a specific aversion to a texture or food item, fine, avoid that. But if they turn up their nose at every meal because they'll just get a plate of nuggets if they do that...well, you've created the problem.", "Not liking certian foods is fine but when you have a kid who omits whole food groups it is a concern. I have one picky eater out of my 3 her pack of fruits and veggies seriously effects her digestion which effects other areas in her life as well. Her minimal protien intake is also concerning because she\u2019s an athlete. It\u2019s definitely bigger than just not liking certian foods.", "A kid this age has a brain that is rapidly changing. They don\u2019t know why they do a lot of dumb stuff they do. If you give them the tools, they turn into adults who can function and teach their own kids how to make sandwiches or whatever.", "Maybe. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of picky eaters are on the spectrum a little bit, and a lot of the time a smell is too strong or a texture feels too strange to them.", "This may be true for a small portion of people we label as \"picky eaters,\" but we are learning that mostly, picky eating is actually related to some kind of neurodivergence or trauma--autism spectrum, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, etc. In these cases the individuals genuinely have some kind of neurological response to \"unsafe\" foods that can be really upsetting. For them, it's like a neurotypical person trying to eat paperclips, or dirt--their brain/body just cannot recognize it as \"food\" and sees it as something unsafe to eat. Or, for some, sensory responses are simply too strong and overpowering. Googling \"ARFID\" and reading a little bit about the struggles and the miserable experiences of people who deal with this might be interesting and might change your view!", "You can prevent food waste by putting it in the fridge/freezer, you don't need to force kids to shove it down their throat whether they're hungry or not", "OCD affects ~1.25% of Americans. Simply picky eaters exist in higher numbers. \n\nNot everything is caused by a diagnosable condition.", "Autistic with OCD here. Couldn\u2019t agree more. My food aversions were so infuriating to my parents that it eventually became abusive. Doesn\u2019t sound like OP is doing that in this case, but not addressing the core of where this issue comes from can be extremely detrimental to this kid in the long run. \n\nSounds like OP is receptive to this being a possibility for their child though, and hopefully if that\u2019s the case they can get him the help and guidance he needs.", "Did kids get dumber in the last 20 years or something?  Why are parents treating high school kids like babies?", "I\u2019m not disagreeing\u2026 However, I also spent a bunch of time in southern Africa where in some places food insecurity means people eat what is available\u2026 they may hate it, it may make them gag, they may want to eat anything other than the two things that they have available for them to eat today and tomorrow and the next day\u2026 But those are the two things they have to fill their tummy, so that\u2019s what they\u2019re eating. \n\nThis is what I mean by privilege. Accommodating Neurodivergence or trauma in our food consumption is only possible when we have that choice. It is entirely possible that given the choice of \u201ceat this food or die\u201c there are people who choose to die but I suspect that is a small percentage of people or else humans would not have proliferated in the way we have.", "Yeah exactly, we don\u2019t know why he is \u2018picky\u2019 so blaming OP for it doesn\u2019t seem fair. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m picky but I\u2019m autistic and often struggle with texture and eating.", "Spot on.", "Spot on.", "I\u2019d like to know how many people in Africa are on the spectrum?  I grew up poor.  I once refused to eat something and my parents make me sit at the table for hours.  Mostly I ate pb&j or baloney sandwiches."]}
