Or he may start bringing his own food places.  Also fine.\n\nBut you're right: it's time for him to take the lead here and decide how he wants to manage his food going forward.  He's old enough to do this himself, and this is going to be something he has to manage in adulthood personally if he remains a picky eater.  Besides reminding him as he learns that this is something he needs to address possibly with pre-planning if he chooses, leaving this to him is completely appropriate.\n\nEven kids with medical reasons for avoiding foods will start to manage their own diets at this age.

So you're not making them food, or even making choices for them, but helping them think through the possibilities, and come up with strategies - ie, if there is maybe a side dish or something that they could fill up on, or maybe they want to brink snacks with them, or is there a place nearby so they can duck out and buy something more to their liking?

If you just have frozen ones you can pop them in the oven or even the micro if you're low on time, don't have an easy to access pan, or are low energy for whatever reason. You don't have to worry about the lack of consistency with things like fresh foods, but you also don't have to put too much effort into making it which can be helpful for making stuff to take on the go. Other safe foods for me are not typically that difficult to make, but they do require some level of prep. Chicken nuggets though, they're fast, they're consistent, they're tasty, they're easily available and common, and I wouldn't call them the best health wise but they do have protein which can be difficult to get when you're limited in what you're eating. So, I imagine for most people it's a combination of access and introduction to them as well as how simple they are, not only is the texture consistent but often the flavour is as well, and the flavour is not like paired with other stuff either- which I am currently fine with most foods mixing but I know that for a lot of people who have issues with food, different textures and/or flavours mixing is a big no no", "Definitely could be.

Because again, it isn't just a dislike, it's a genuine revulsion that is not that easily controllable.

I am trying to get over some of those, slowly introducing sea food is a thing I am working in right now, but that is also a thing I have been working on for years and I can still only eat shrimp regularly but doing so still causes some stress, I've eaten fish like twice but couldn't finish it. Historically though eating it would freak me out to the point where it would make me throw up, and I wouldn't be able to eat for a bit after because of how distressed I was. I still can't eat carrots in most situations (I can in some soups and I don't mind carrot cake) cause the texture and flavour will freak me out to a degree that to basically everyone is considered unreasonable.

I was not in the \u201cdanger\u201d zone of underweight (because when I did eat, it was breads and desserts), but I ate so poorly, my feet turned blue, and I would go blind for a few seconds standing up. I was constantly light-headed and weak and had trouble concentrating in school. Finally I was diagnosed with ARFID. But I was exhausted with it by then, I gave up and said I wanted the the relief of either a feeding tube or death. As a result I ended up in the Emily Program eating disorder residential care for 3 weeks, and partial hospitalization for months after.\n\nThings I wish more people understood:\n* boys and men can have eating disorders, not just girls and women\n* ARFID exists and can be a serious disorder. Does your body care if the missed meals are due to body image or due to sensory avoidance? The consequences are the same.\n* Eating disorders are a serious and sometimes deadly form of mental illness. Even if it doesn\u2019t kill you or damage your organs, it sucks away quality of life. Being constantly light-headed and weak sucks.\n* Feeding yourself is HARD. Commenters are talking like it\u2019s common sense. But it is a combination of so many skills, like nutrition, time and money management, meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking, and portioning. I would not expect a neurotypical kid barely out of middle school to have mastery of all of these skills instinctively, let alone if he were neurodivergent.\n\nHere are some tips that may help:\n* Make sure he takes a daily multivitamin to avoid a nutrition deficiency\n* Help him calculate how many calories he needs per day, versus how many he actually eats and burns.\n* Teach him about macro and micro nutrients. Balance protein/fat/carb foods to get consistent energy continuously. Teach him about micronutrients and warning signs of deficiency.\n* If he misses or does not finish the meal, he can have a meal replacement shake (The Emily Program gave us 1 Ensure or Boost for an incomplete meal, and 2 for a skipped meal. They called it \u201cboosting\u201d)\n* Teach him how to look for new recipes, plan meals, shop for ingredients, cook for himself, and plate up appropriate portions.\n* Encourage him to have back-up \u201csafe foods\u201d like protein bars. Bring them to events with food. Keep them in the bedside table, the backpack, or the car.\n* Teach distress tolerance skills so he is equipped to challenge \u201cunsafe foods\u201d. Talking through the reasons he doesn\u2019t want to eat something (is he scared of getting sick?) Distraction with conversation or music or TV. Holding an ice pack or hot pack. Square breathing.

They fostered that level of dependence they need to to ease them out of it.", "Cooking is a very specific skill.\n\nIf you fail: you waste nutrients, have to eat something that tastes awful or can make yourself and others sick or even can burn something.\n\nFollowing a recipe does not always work especially if you start out blank without prior knowledge on mixing tastes, processes and everything else.\n\nCooking should be taught young to everyone even if to create the baseline knowledge that later allows less problems when expanding upon for that reason, if you watched your adults cook or helped/cooked as a child it makes world of difference to just later google and immadiately know what to do after reading simple instructions.", "Here\u2019s the thing with \u201cnot being taught\u201d things like these: what we think is absolute common sense, may simply not occur to a kid. Teens are scatterbrained, let\u2019s be honest. It\u2019s less about literally teaching them, and more about making sure that this easy obvious thing is also obvious to them.", "> By the time I was 10, if not earlier, I was self-aware enough to know that I didn't like most food and that there were times I would have to fend for myself. \n\nSame. I have serious texture issues, as well as a couple of food allergies & lactose intolerance, which is honestly the hardest part of trying to eat while I'm at an event, etc. \n\nNow that I'm an adult, I often bring a dish to pass that I know I'll be able to eat and enjoy. Kids have a harder time with that option, but the forethought to do it starts as a teenager. \n\nI also tend to store snacks in places I can easily or surreptitiously get to them if I get to a place and realize the whole meal is problematic, like the year my ex MIL put some kind of pork in literally everything they made for Thanksgiving, including candied bacon on the pumpkin pie. Since we weren't prepared for that particular move, I was up the creek that day, but this is the stage it sounds like OP's son is at. Peanut butter filled pretzels in a bag in the car or a Bobo's bar will keep him from being too hungry while he either expands his palette or remembers how to be responsible for his own needs.", "I don\u2019t get it either, the texture of chicken nuggets the the knowledge of how they got made grossed me out as a kid and we didn\u2019t have a single kid who had to have nuggets. We were not a blue box Mac n cheese or frozen nuggets family and it shows not one of us 3 kids has major food aversions that aren\u2019t allergy based and even that is minor stuff (one of us is allergic to shellfish, another to cayenne) So between the two of us we don\u2019t do gumbo or much Cajun style meals but we each like what the other is allergic to, and got exposed to plenty of other styles of cooking. And at this point, I swear it starts for young kids who\u2019s parents phone it in on cooking, bringing in variety or letting kids see their parents enjoying a variety. They don\u2019t push them trying new foods, even a bite, and often don\u2019t share mealtimes with their kids at all. If they aren\u2019t cautious about making those changes when they\u2019re around elementary school age, it won\u2019t go away. \n\nAs an adult, I was roommates with a \u201cnugget adult\u201d who lived off of frozen nuggets, frozen cheese pizzas and fast food.

People with heightened senses (autistics) would disagree with you. They have plenty of taste. The things you like have way too much taste and it\u2019s overwhelming and disgusting to us. I learned to eat more foods when I realised I could have things plain, with no added seasoning.", "Please do! As a person who got diagnosed with autism in adulthood, it's so much better to know whether you're neurodivergent as soon as possible. Also, speaking from experience, just leaving him out to dry food-wise without communicating or empathizing with him will make him feel rejected, and rejection sensitivity leads directly to defiance (which is of course amplified by him being 14). Talking to him about how he feels and why he's behaving in the way that he does is the right call and will help you both move forward more constructively.", "Dude is a teenage and you expect him to be able to learn and treat this himself without professional help. \n\nAbsolutely ridiculous responses in here.", " If the kid is spoiled,,", "Maybe not baby in the first place?

They died off other causes much before cancer could kill them. And even when cancer *did* kill them, we didn't have the technology to diagnose it as such. **But none of that was a good thing!?**\n\nSimilarly my generation can afford to focus on mental health, whereas my grandparents (who were destitute refugees fleeing a conflict) could not.

How about you reevaluate you're understanding of my comment, please and thank you. \n\nIt is also important to note, that when it comes to safe foods, lots of people who have them have sensory issues regarding the food and can not just move on to something else if it does not match with their needs. For many people both regarding this topic as well as other topics best is not always achievable, good is not always achievable, sometimes better than nothing is the best someone can do at any given moment or regarding any specific thing, and it is good to recognize that it is okay for that to be the case. Personally I get protein from other sources, I have not actually eaten many chicken nuggets recently tbh, that is not always possible for other people though. And even if what you are eating is not a good source of protein, you don't have to get all the good stuff from one place.

They sound miserable.   \n\nOne way to be happy and thriving is to be secure in the knowledge that you can handle most problems that come your way.  Raising children to trust in their own resourcefulness, teaching them problem solving skills and letting them practice and learn from small failures is part of that.   \n\nIf getting a diagnosis and doing all this mental health work was actually making people happy and thriving, I'd be all for it.

So, if you\u2019re giving him 6 nuggets you\u2019re giving him 1,680mg of sodium per meal. A child of that age shouldn\u2019t have more than 1,500mg per sodium a day and he\u2019s definitely getting sodium in other stuff so he\u2019s well over his daily limit of sodium.
