No one is going to starve to death at a party. He can eat in advance, choose something offered there, or (worst option) bring his own food.\n\nI do think you need to be taking action to help him improve the situation. Could be anything all the way from toddler-level strategies to expand his food menu, all the way up to having him work with a therapist who specializes in food aversion.", "NTA - this is wild. First off, he\u2019s old enough to figure this out on his own. Second, you\u2019re doing him a favor by not babying him.", "NTA\n\nHighschool is 14 years old. He can work a microwave or make a PBJ sandwich.", "NTA\n\nHe's old enough to make & baggie a sandwich, if that's his preference.\n\nThe reason for my vote: I've mommed kids that age & know their abilities.  I, myself, was a very, Very picky eater at that age.", "NTA. But constantly providing alternatives like chicken nuggets has led to this situation. Hindsight is 20/20, I know, but still. He's old enough to stop eating like a toddler.\n\nThe only exception I can fathom to that would be if he was severely autistic, or dealing with another illness along those lines.", "NTA\n\nOne way or another, this is something he needs to learn to manage personally.  He may decide that he will try new foods to lessen the burden on himself, and that would be great.  He may decide he'll start eating before he goes places in case they don't have anything he wants to eat.  That's an acceptable way to manage being a picky eater too.  Or he may start bringing his own food places.  Also fine.\n\nBut you're right: it's time for him to take the lead here and decide how he wants to manage his food going forward.  He's old enough to do this himself, and this is going to be something he has to manage in adulthood personally if he remains a picky eater.  Besides reminding him as he learns that this is something he needs to address possibly with pre-planning if he chooses, leaving this to him is completely appropriate.\n\nEven kids with medical reasons for avoiding foods will start to manage their own diets at this age.  It's a critical adult life skill to make sure you have something to eat when you anticipate you might need food.", "NTA. Your son is old enough to pack his own food. He's almost in high-school and this is a life skill he needs.", "NTA\n\nI started making my own breakfast and packing my own lunches by 5th grade.", "NTA = Not the Asshole\n\nI agree. He is old enough to know how to put a sandwich together. I think its your responsibility to make sure there's food in the fridge, but beyond that its up to him to eat.", "This is the thing: even if he has ARFID or other food aversion things, he is old enough to learn how to manage that. He needs help, though. Like reminding him that an event (party, restaurant trip, whatever) is coming up and that he needs to prepare. Probably the day before and definitely the day of. Remind him that YOU will not be packing him a food alternative, that it is his responsibility, but that you will help. It has to become routine. Even though he is definitely old enough to take this on, he has to be taught, and teaching requires repetition.\n\nI wish you and the kid luck. I made a lot of mistakes as a parent (nothing dire, just things I would change), and will no doubt make more. So will you. Be kind to yourself and your kid, but do try to be consistent.", "NTA , Your Son (?) is clearly old enough to learn to be a little more independent and look after himself in these situations.\n\nHave you considered some kind of professional help to get to the reason why he's so picky ?", "I think it all comes down to how you handled the change and how you talked about it with your child. They're old enough to a converstation about it. \n\nIf the kid is a picky eater because they're autistic and you just gave up it sounds bad. And in that case it would be understandable why your relatives got upset.\n\nOther case is that you teached your kid to be a picky eater and now they need you to teach them how to live with it.\n\nBut NTA for wanting him take responsability.\n\nEdit. I Will keep the right to change my vote if it turns out you didn't handle it well and didn't try to teach them on how to compensate.", "NTA - this is a reasonable age to begin implementing opportunities for independence. He's going to be in high school and should start thinking of these things for himself.", "Absolutely NTA Your son is going into high school. If he doesn't have the foresight to pack a sandwich or snack when he's going somewhere he may not like the food, he's going to go hungry. Most children can be a little picky but your son isn't a small child, he's a teenager. At some point he needs to take a little responsibility for himself.", "NTA, he's certainly old enough that bringing his own food to events like that is highly inappropriate", "I don't understand this phenomenon.  Picky eaters preferred choice is chicken nuggets.  I am mystified.  Processed cubes of chicken. Everyday? Is it the texture,  the taste, or the compactness? Or is it the fear of growing up? Just baffling to me.", "NTA, he's old enough to remember things that are important to him. I bet he has a phone and has never forgotten it at home. He can put a granola bar in his pocket or something.", "You earned him before these recent outings that he was responsible for packing something he would be willing to eat, right? Then NTA\n\nAnd at your Aunt\u2019s house? There, as hostess,  your aunt can cater to his picky needs.", "I live in a country where kids bring packed lunches to school. I packed my own from I was 7 years old, and so did most of my friends, no problem. Your kid is a big boy, and my question may be silly, but does he know how to pack a meal? Does he know where the tupperware is, what kind of food that will keep, how to pack it without everything mixing into a terrible mess?\n\nI think you're on the right track on giving him the responsibility for what to eat and how to go about it. However, I would sit down with him and have a calm conversation laying down clear expectations. Then I'd talk with him about the hows. For example, he may need some reminders the first days, or you can find other ways to make him remember (like on his phone). He may need some pointers on how to do it, how much he should pack etc.\n\nHe may kick off  from not having his eating as a way of control and attention anymore, and that may actually be hard on him, but that's when it's important to stand your ground and remind him of what you agreed on.  YNTA, but you made this bed, and just to shrug it off now may not be very constructive.", "NTA. he's what, 14? My 10yo cooks her own dinner if she doesn't like what's provided, your kid can pack himself a lunch. \n\nYou are doing the right thing OP. He needs to learn to be somewhat self sufficient or real life is going to absolutely destroy him.", "Could be food sensory issue??", "I\u2019m guessing at his age, but he should know how to cook for himself by now, too. Parents who do not teach their children how to prepare a meal do them a big disservice (and they really are not doing their parenting duties.) Cleaning, laundry, shopping, budgeting, paying bills, making appointments, reading legal papers, car care, lawn care, etc, etc, etc are all things parents are responsible for teaching their children about. These are all things a young adult should know by age 18. Your son is going into high school, and your concern is \u201che\u2019s a picky eater.\u201d IMO, you\u2019ve really got to pick up the pace at teaching this young man how to function in this world. NTA for not packing his lunch. You WILL be the a$$ if you think you\u2019re just going to dump him on a girlfriend to teach him everything he should know already at age 18 (or sooner.) You can do better as a parent and teacher for your child. Good luck.", "INFO: is he neurodivergent or does he have sensory issues?

Just let him know that plans are happening and it's up to him to remember to make his own food if he wants to bring it. Also tell him at the same time you will only be providing so many reminders and soon enough it will be on him to think ahead and decide whether he feels he wants food packed or not and act accordingly.

My parents were also Eat Everything On Your Plate No Matter What, and I don't know if I'll ever work through my own consequent food issues and disordered eating :(\n\nThat said, I think you are NTA but maybe there's a way to keep supporting your child in his food issues without acting as a personal short-order cook?\n\nIf you've been catering to his needs until this sudden cut-off, is it possible that he doesn't really have the experience and confidence to plan ahead? It seems simple to grown-ass adults, but I know that if there's something I'm not familiar with, it can be really intimidating even if it's not difficult to perform.\n\nWhat if you modeled food planning with your child? Like, the next time something like this is coming up, you could discuss options for them? So you're not making them food, or even making choices for them, but helping them think through the possibilities, and come up with strategies - ie, if there is maybe a side dish or something that they could fill up on, or maybe they want to brink snacks with them, or is there a place nearby so they can duck out and buy something more to their liking?  That way, hopefully, you can continue the supportive part of parenting without just enabling them never having to deal with it themselves?", "Is it possible he has texture issues?\n I used to be the same mainly because while I loved the taste of fruits and veggies, Id gag no matter what. I have ARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder). If my brain only wants to eat one single thing, mine is chicken with rice, eating anything else can make me phsycially sick. Im better now that Im an adult but as a kid, it was hell being force fed stuff and my parents not understanding at all", "why it seems that you dismiss him being autistic or sensory sensitive or other issues ?? You asked him !!! Great but maybe he doesn't understand why he is doing what he is doing . One thing is for sure he is not a picky eater because he wants to be one . there is something behind  it .", "Bwa ha ha. I know your pain. Kiddo loves grandma's scrambled eggs but won't touch mine. I asked her who the hell did she think taught me how to make scrambled eggs in the first place. \n\nWe didn't enforce a \"clean your plate\" method and still had a somewhat picky kid. High school changed that right quick. No one is going to want to go out for chicken nuggets every time you go to eat.

Please try to come to a compromise with him as well, I hate to say this but you may have enabled his eating behavior for a very long time and it can be difficult to try and introduce foods back into his diet. I am not sure if this can help you but my cousin has autism and was very selective with food but she also has comfort characters so we were able to convince her to try foods that her comfort character also likes to just get a foot through the door. You also mentioned in another comment that your son doesn't like eggs, but maybe you can try to give him food that contains eggs, or maybe he will be more tolerant to veggies if they are mashed or blended (mashed cauliflower+spinach+a cube of broth is really tasty and healthy too). There are many food subreddits where you can get some ideas and inspiration too! Good luck!", "With that response, I honestly don't think it is fair for anyone to judge in this scenario.\nI appreciate this has got to be frustrating for you, and your son should learn to be more independent. Hopefully, you and your son can work this out. All the best", "We had him tested when he was a kid, maybe I should do that again. I thought I just messed up by giving in all the time with food but OCD would make more sense"]}
