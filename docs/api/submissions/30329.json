{"id": 30329, "submission_id": "17nyh3r", "title": "AITA For choosing my daughter over my niece?", "selftext": "Yesterday, my family had a game night and my (M28) sister (\"Kate\" F27) was asking \"what if/this or that\" questions. It was going well, until it wasn't. I am a single father raising my daughter (\"Sarah\" F6). Her mother (\"Marie\" F25), my fiance, died last year during childbirth to our baby, Sarah's brother. Sarah is my only living child and I do not plan on having anymore. Marie was the love of my life and I don't think I'll ever want to be with anyone else. Anyway, last night, few questions in, Kate asked \"If you (me) took Sarah and (her daughter/my niece \"Lilly\" F8) to the ocean and they both began to drown, who would you save?\" Obviously, I found this to be a very strange question. I told her that I would save both of them and left it alone but she would drop it. She kept asking and eventually I got angry and told her that I would save my daughter. She was furious. She said that if she put her child in my care, then she would want to believe that she would be safe. Now, I guess she doesn't feel safe with me taking Lilly out with me anymore. I was offended because Lilly and I have spent a lot of time together since her father left. She was a 2 years old when he left. Sarah was a baby and I told Kate that I would look out for her because with having Sarah, I know how important it is for a little girl to have a father figure in her life. We all live in the same neighborhood, so when I took Sarah to the park, I brought Lilly. When I took Sarah out to lunch, I brought Lilly. When I brought Sarah to Disneyland, I brought Lilly. I love her and I try to do my best to be the good man in her young life. I told Kate that these were just rhetorical questions and I didn't mean anything by it, but she didn't want to hear me out. I don't think I could handle loosing Sarah. She's my daughter and the best reminder of Marie. I don't want either of them to die, but if I were to think about how I react in that moment, I think I would save Sarah. I feel really bad and Kate, a long with my other siblings, are calling me selfish because Lilly would be my responsibility too. AITA?\n\n(Im sorry if this sounds weird, but I'm upset and having a hard time calling down enough to type this.)\n\nEdit #1: clarification on who took the children to the beach.\n\nEdit #2 - comment: Im glad that so far, you guys don't see me as the AH. I just don't want Kate to make Lilly believe that I don't love her. I also don't know why she would ask this question to begin with. She's been calling me all day but I haven't answered because I'm so angry right now. Should I seriously ask her what she would do? I don't know what she wanted me to say in that situation.\n\nBackground info: He ex, Lilly's dad, was also really abusive and kept her pretty isolated from us. I'm sure whatever he has said or done to her has significantly dented her self esteem. That man chose drugs over her and Lilly every chance that he got. Regardless, Kate was with him and they were trying for another baby right after Lilly but for some reason she was told that she wouldn't ae to have anymore. Why? No idea. She kept it to herself. So I guess that could be why she cared so much. (A bit of a stretch but whatever)\n\nExplanation and update: The start of the questions wasn't horrible. It was her and our 17 year old sister taking turns asking everyone. I still have absolutely no idea why she would ask me that particular question. Yes, they were all kind of weird but that one, just no. I definitely should have stuck to my first answer of both, but with her pushing I was feeling a lot of feelings and just said it. All rhetorical questions are stupid, but the topic for me seems insensitive. Our brother and her are pretty close so I called him and asked what was up and he told me that she said it wasn't a big deal of a question and I shouldn't have gotten defensive. He said that she also said that I should have chosen Lilly because she was my responsibility and the only child that Kate could have. Kate said that I could have more, but she couldn't so Lilly should take priority. Yep, I said that I was done for the night.\n\nEdit #3: autocorrect hates me\n\nEdit #4 - Answering general questions. Is Kate normally crazy? Eh, kind of. She has high highs and low lows. She's been through a lot so everybody tends to her but technically, everybody goes through a lot, I guess she just handles her problems in a different way. Is Kate jealous? Maybe. I try to be a good man and I think I'm going pretty well. The men around me tend to run in the opposite direction when it comes to handling their responsibilities. I have had trouble, but I still make sure to get stuff done. I am a kind and generous man. I try not to raise my voice and have never raised my hand to any woman. I make sure that my bills are paid and that there is food on the table. I try to make sure that my people are safe and happy. I do my best in general and try to spread that love and care around because I know that it is important. Hence, caring for Lilly. I love that kid, I really do. I feel bad for her and want to do what I can for her but have to remember that she is not mine. As much as it pains me, I know that no one will look out for Sarah like I do. I can't slack on her for the next. I won't.

She is a major AH and crazy for thinking that this forced answer says anything about you protecting her kid in real life. That's so insane to me. You initially said that you would save both, AND SHE DID NOT EXCEPT THAT (sorry for yelling, but I'm furious right now). \n\nYou did nothing wrong, and it's so frikin natural to save your own child - I certainly would. Even more so, as she carries a part of your wife as well. How dare she expects you to sacrifice that in a hypothetical and then judge you on that.

She asked who you would save and you said you would save both kids. Then she kept pressing you for a different answer and got angry when you said you would save Sarah (your own child). This makes it sound like she wanted you to say you would save Lilly over Sarah. That is, to put it mildly.... a very strange position for her to expect you to take. She thinks you should save her child and leave your own child to die? Something is very wrong with her thinking if she thinks that was a reasonable answer to try to get from you. And to punish you for giving the \"wrong' answer, even stranger. \n\nHonestly it might be better if you drew away from both Lilly and Kate in future. If Kate expects you to put her child before your own, then you cannot meet Kate's expectations for how she wants her child to be supervised. And if Kate thinks Sarah's own father should put Sarah second to Lilly, then what sort of messages, conscious and unconscious, is Kate sending to Sarah when they interact?

This hypothetical situation is not able to be extrapolated to any other situations. It's very specific and unlikely that you are putting the children into any kind of dangerous situation where one or both could die. \n3. The reality is that no matter how we think we would react in an extreme situation, nobody really knows what they'd do until they're in the situation. You could freeze up entirely and do nothing. You could yell for help and someone else could save one child and you the other. Your niece could be much closer than your daughter and you could realize that your daughter is too far away and you could never get to her in time but you could actually save your niece, so even though it's killing you inside you choose to save the child you could save instead of them both dying. You could get caught in the same current they did and drown trying to save them. Or some other scenario entirely. This super generic \"who would you save\" without knowing a million other factors involved is pointless.\n4. You should ask her the same hypothetical question and see what her response is.
