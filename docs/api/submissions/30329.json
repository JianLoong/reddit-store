{"id": 30329, "submission_id": "17nyh3r", "title": "AITA For choosing my daughter over my niece?", "selftext": "Yesterday, my family had a game night and my (M28) sister (\"Kate\" F27) was asking \"what if/this or that\" questions. It was going well, until it wasn't. I am a single father raising my daughter (\"Sarah\" F6). Her mother (\"Marie\" F25), my fiance, died last year during childbirth to our baby, Sarah's brother. Sarah is my only living child and I do not plan on having anymore. Marie was the love of my life and I don't think I'll ever want to be with anyone else. Anyway, last night, few questions in, Kate asked \"If you (me) took Sarah and (her daughter/my niece \"Lilly\" F8) to the ocean and they both began to drown, who would you save?\" Obviously, I found this to be a very strange question. I told her that I would save both of them and left it alone but she would drop it. She kept asking and eventually I got angry and told her that I would save my daughter. She was furious. She said that if she put her child in my care, then she would want to believe that she would be safe. Now, I guess she doesn't feel safe with me taking Lilly out with me anymore. I was offended because Lilly and I have spent a lot of time together since her father left. She was a 2 years old when he left. Sarah was a baby and I told Kate that I would look out for her because with having Sarah, I know how important it is for a little girl to have a father figure in her life. We all live in the same neighborhood, so when I took Sarah to the park, I brought Lilly. When I took Sarah out to lunch, I brought Lilly. When I brought Sarah to Disneyland, I brought Lilly. I love her and I try to do my best to be the good man in her young life. I told Kate that these were just rhetorical questions and I didn't mean anything by it, but she didn't want to hear me out. I don't think I could handle loosing Sarah. She's my daughter and the best reminder of Marie. I don't want either of them to die, but if I were to think about how I react in that moment, I think I would save Sarah. I feel really bad and Kate, a long with my other siblings, are calling me selfish because Lilly would be my responsibility too. AITA?\n\n(Im sorry if this sounds weird, but I'm upset and having a hard time calling down enough to type this.)\n\nEdit #1: clarification on who took the children to the beach.\n\nEdit #2 - comment: Im glad that so far, you guys don't see me as the AH. I just don't want Kate to make Lilly believe that I don't love her. I also don't know why she would ask this question to begin with. She's been calling me all day but I haven't answered because I'm so angry right now. Should I seriously ask her what she would do? I don't know what she wanted me to say in that situation.", "created_utc": 1699140085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nyh3r/aita_for_choosing_my_daughter_over_my_niece/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And wtf??? What question is this in the first place? And did she really expect you to save her child and not your own daughter? \n\nAgain: WTF? She is a major AH and crazy for thinking that this forced answer says anything about you protecting her kid in real life. That's so insane to me. You initially said that you would save both, AND SHE DID NOT EXCEPT THAT (sorry for yelling, but I'm furious right now). \n\nYou did nothing wrong, and it's so frikin natural to save your own child - I certainly would. Even more so, as she carries a part of your wife as well. How dare she expects you to sacrifice that in a hypothetical and then judge you on that. Poor woman!\n\nEdit to add cuz I forgot that: I'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm sure you're a good father and uncle. Please don't beat yourself up over this\ud83d\udc9c", "NTA, your sister was out of line for asking that question and has no sense of boundaries. She kept asking even after you answered and showed discomfort. The fact that she\u2019s okay with you picking one or the other is insane. Let\u2019s be honest everyone (or at least the good parents)will choose their kid over anyone, period. So would she. And your siblings are wrong for taking sides. They should\u2019ve at least been neutral. \nDon\u2019t beat yourself up sounds like you\u2019re doing a good job being her uncle.", "lol what\n\nObviously NTA. She asked you to answer a no win situation, and is upset you didn\u2019t win. \n\nThis was a trap question, and anyone who asks a trap question is instantly the asshole. \n\nIf you flipped the question back to her, it\u2019s a guarantee she is gonna save her own child before yours. \n\nWhat a dumb thing for her to be upset about.", "I'm confused about this question. She asked who you would save and you said you would save both kids. Then she kept pressing you for a different answer and got angry when you said you would save Sarah (your own child). This makes it sound like she wanted you to say you would save Lilly over Sarah. That is, to put it mildly.... a very strange position for her to expect you to take. She thinks you should save her child and leave your own child to die? Something is very wrong with her thinking if she thinks that was a reasonable answer to try to get from you. And to punish you for giving the \"wrong' answer, even stranger. \n\nHonestly it might be better if you drew away from both Lilly and Kate in future. If Kate expects you to put her child before your own, then you cannot meet Kate's expectations for how she wants her child to be supervised. And if Kate thinks Sarah's own father should put Sarah second to Lilly, then what sort of messages, conscious and unconscious, is Kate sending to Sarah when they interact? I am not sure Kate will be a good influence on Sarah's psyche.", "She\u2019s the kid that would ask her mom if house is burning and you could only save me or brother which would you save? Then continue to ask and only stop if answer was one sister wanted. Your sister is a jerk. No one should ever answer these questions. NTA", "Wow.  Your sister is a psycho.\n\nNTA.", "Make her answer the same question. NTA she is", "NTA. What parent wouldn't say the same thing???", "I want to know what her answer is to the same question because anything other than her daughter is a lie and your other siblings are nuts. NTA", "Nta. I'd spin it around on her, ask her if it came between her daughter or niece who'd she chose. And when she chooses her daughter, tell her you don't feel comfortable letting your daughter around her since she wouldn't be safe", "NTA \n\nOP this feels like a deliberate set up. The only AH here is your sister for even asking such a ridiculous question in the first place.", "NTA.\n\nTop response dad. Your sister is insane and thoughtless for asking that in the first place.", "Your sister is fucked up to even ask the question and duh, of course you would try to save your own first if you had to choose. NTA", "NTA, everyone would save their own child first. Why ask a question you already know the answer to and then become mad? did she really want you to say you would save her kid over your own?", "NTA.\n\nYou answered correctly.\n\nBTW, from experience I'll tell you - an answer like this in front of your child - they will probably remember all their lives.\n\nGood job dad, for realz.", "Presumably in that same imaginary scenario, your sister would also save her own daughter over her niece. \n\nNTA because anyone would.", "NTA \n\nThis is the bullshite hypothetical that gets asked.... And then forced to answer.... And they always hate the answers.\n\nWould you save me or our child? Would you love me if I had a sex change? If the mugger says which one of you do I kill?\n\nDon't ask effing hypotheticals... But if you do, tell me my answer first so we can get on with reality", "Ask her the same question with her having both kids in front of her daughter. Then compliment her skill at lying and say you should take lessons from her.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m not sure if anyone has pointed this out yet but this question is out of bounds at the best of times not to mention in a situation where a child and spouse have already died\u2026 heck?!?", "With all due respect OP, but f!!k your siblings. This was a question that had ZERO positive outcome. \n\nSo Kate can go eff herself and so can your other siblings. NTA hands down. Keep being a great dad and hopefully uncle.", "NTA, even though really I think you should have not answered the question no matter how much she pushed. Your response was not the \u201ccorrect\u201d one like many people are saying. \n\nIt\u2019s a no win and a wtf is wrong with your sister for asking, but like naming a favorite child not something you can take back. \n\nHopefully you can find some more context as to what was going through her head and repair the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
