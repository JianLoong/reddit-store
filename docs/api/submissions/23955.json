Over the past few years, my sister, Chloe (32F) has made grand promises on Daniella on her birthday and then falls through. The first came when Daniella was 9 and Chloe promised to take her to her first Broadway show. I checked with Chloe a couple of times that she could actually afford it, actually wanted to take a 9 year old to the city (we live about an hour away), etc. Chloe promised up and down it was all good. Then, 2 days before the show, she said plans changed and she sold the tickets. Daniella was naturally devastated but Chloe tried to make it up to her by taking her out to dinner the following week.\nFor Daniella\u2019s 10th & 11th birthdays, a similar thing happened. The 10th, Chloe put an IOU in the card and basically told Daniella she could cash it in for one of a few activities. Daniella would text Chloe throughout the year, asking when they would do it, but Chloe always had an excuse. Eventually, the year ended with nothing being done. Daniella said that she didn\u2019t care about not getting a gift, but it was disappointing to be promised something then have it taken away. She actually talked to Chloe about it and Chloe apologized.\n\nThe 11th birthday was the worst example in my opinion. Chloe promised she would take her the following weekend to an amusement park that Daniella really wanted to go to. Daniella was so excited but Chloe continued cancelling on her until the amusement park closed for the season.\n\nIt should be noted that these things Chloe promises, is stuff out of my budget most of the time. I did end up doing 2 of activities that were on the IOU, but things like a Broadway show as well as the amusement park tickets were not something I could afford. I did save up to bring Daniella this summer and she had a ton of fun, but I know it was disappointing for her last year. Chloe apologized, but Daniella was less receptive to it that time.\n\nThis year, Chloe told me she wanted to take Daniella to New York overnight to see a show. I asked for proof this was booked. Chloe said she would do it once she \u201cfigured out a time they could go\u201d. I said no. No more of this. She doesn\u2019t have to give Daniella anything at all, but if she does, it needs to be something planned and something she doesn\u2019t intend to back out of. No more IOUs. If she wants to gift these things, they need to be booked and non-refundable so I can see that she isn\u2019t going to back out. Chloe promised this time would be different. I said, okay, then do as I asked. Chloe said I was being unfair and holding the past against her. She also said I can\u2019t control what she gives my daughter for her birthday. Some members of our family have backed her up, saying Chloe is harmless and Daniella needs to understand sometimes things don\u2019t work out. I pointed out my daughter knows that lesson very well as she lost her mom young and the only consistent woman figure she has (her aunt) keeps letting her down.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691259181, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15j2jfh/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_need_to_see_proof_of/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Three strikes, you're out.", "Right?\n\nHonestly I\u2019m wondering if at this point the daughter even wants Chloe at her birthday.  If someone let me down multiple years in a row I\u2019d probably just learn that this isn\u2019t someone I can trust or depend on and I wouldn\u2019t trust a single thing they said.\n\nNTA- stick to your guns you can\u2019t give promises as gifts if you never plan to follow through. This isn\u2019t a kid making a coupon book for mom or dad with cute little things- this is a grown adult repeatedly screwing over a child just because they can\u2019t stop being a flake.\n\nShe said she sold the tickets she bought for her niece\u2019s birthday? Are you kidding me? Who the hell fences a gift for a child?\n\nHonestly the only people I know who sink that low are those who are selling the things to pay for their addictions.\n\nI get that these things are expensive and I can understand they\u2019re not in someone\u2019s budget. However if you can\u2019t afford something you don\u2019t just promise it anyways.\n\nShe needs to stop with the showy grand gestures and just get gifts that she can actually afford and give her then.\n\nSorry but Chloe seems like a disaster and I\u2019d really be wary of trusting my child to someone so flakey, callous and careless.", "Yes. What Daniella is learning is that nothing ever works out, when Chloe promises it.\n\n\"she enjoys the way it feels in the moment to make big, wonderful-sounding promises.\"\n\nExactly. I do wonder if Chloe doesn't really think of Daniella as being a person who gets hurt and remembers that. Sometimes people have weird ideas about kids.", "> Yea, yea you absolutely can control what people give your little girl\n\nExactly. The girl is a minor, OP can absolutely prevent other adults from giving her things he disapproves of.", "NTA \"How dare you hold hurting your daughter over and over and over with my BS against me?\" The relatives who say Chloe is harmless can start working over the $$$ for the activities and plans Chloe lies to your daughter about.", "I might even warn my daughter beforehand that if her Aunt gives her something for her birthday, that it is likely just a false promise. Have the letdown be beforehand rather than time and time again in the future.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love you, it just means she\u2019s unreliable.", "Those tickets 100% did not exist", "Oh they did, they were always just owned by someone else."]}
