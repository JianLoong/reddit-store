I\u2019ve eaten there when I visited their city and was not impressed. The food is decent but inconsistent and that\u2019s about the only good thing I can say about her place. The soup is always lukewarm and sometimes the dishes are hotter than the food. The staff was rude and spent most of their time either on their phone or in groups talking. This meant it took longer than necessary to clean tables after diners have already left. On my last visit, the table next to me was empty yet full of dirty dishes for the duration of my meal. The restroom was never clean on any of my visits and was out of soap more times than it had soap. \n\nLast night, I had my children and their families over for Sunday dinner. During this visit, my DIL asked me for a $100,000 loan for her restaurant. She told me how her business is inconsistent and that\u2019s caused her to burn through their savings. We spoke for awhile until I offered to loan it to her but with some changes. I told her about the problems I listed above and options on how to fix them. She got very agitated at this and sarcastically asked how many restaurants I\u2019ve owned. I didn\u2019t appreciate her response so I answered, \u201cnone but I\u2019ve never sky dived before but know enough to not jump out of a plane without a parachute\u201d. \n\nThat got the attention of everyone at the dinner table. Eventually she said the restaurant is hers, she doesn\u2019t need suggestions from someone who\u2019s never ran one before (I\u2019ll give her this point), and that I\u2019m a control freak to try to tell her what to do with her own business. At this point I withdrew my loan offer and dinner was pretty much over and they left to go home instead of the original plan of staying until Tuesday.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard from my son this morning but his siblings are split on the issue. Some said it\u2019s my choice to loan or not loan her the money but I shouldn\u2019t tell her what she needs to do. Others said that I\u2019m right that if I\u2019m putting my money at risk, I have a say on how she\u2019s running her place.", "created_utc": 1699279082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p3azw/aita_for_pulling_my_offer_to_loan_my_dil_money/", "score": 3007, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are understandably worried about if she will be able to repay you.\n\nGiving opinions on how to increase business in order to ensure your loan is a good decision on your part is valid.\n\nIt's your money and your choice.\n\nIf it doesn't seem like a good investment, don't do it.\n\nNTA", "9 out of 10 restaurants fail. That is not a value judgement, it's a proven statistic. \n\nI'd argue that $100,000 is not just a loan, it's a financial investment. She's asking you to be an investor in the business, and that comes with certain legal rights, and she has a fiduciary responsibility to spend that money wisely (particularly if that money is, as she stated, a \"loan\").\n\nIf you are seriously thinking about this at all, I'd contact a lawyer and offer to have a sit-down with the three of you- so you can discuss options, a contract (where it is clearly stipulated that though it is an investment, you *will* be paid back the money, possibly with interest) that goes over her responsibilities with the money, the areas of the restaurant that you expect to see improved (ie, the chief areas where the money will be spent), and how much legal say you have in the business based on its total value and how much money she is asking you for. I'd ask to see a business and marketing plan in writing, for how she plans to combat her \"inconsistent business\", one with concrete steps and benchmarks, and contingency plans should those steps fail.\n\nNone of this is wildly out of line considering she's asking for a six-figure loan.\n\nBut dollars to doughnuts, she won't want to. Because my guess is, based on her behavior when you gave suggestions? She has zero intentions of paying this money back. I'd be willing to bet that she has zero plans to change anything, and just wants more cash flow to keep herself out of bankruptcy... because she sounds like she's in love with the *idea* of owning a restaurant, rather than the reality of *running* one.\n\nA question for her: how many restaurants has she *worked* in? How many restaurants has she been the GM for? I'm guessing the number is low, or even zero. It always baffles me the number of people who jump to owning a restaurant without having spent a decade working in one... you've got to know all the ins and outs, otherwise you're setting yourself up for failure. \n\nMy biggest rule re: loans is, \"never loan anything you wouldn't be fine with losing.\"\n\nIf you're at a point where you are financially comfortable (and emotionally comfortable) with the possibility of losing $100k? Then go for it. Otherwise, I'd refuse without a legal path and a contract to get your money back.\n\nETA: judgment, NTA", "NTA. Never throw good money after bad. Clearly, she's never run a restaurant before, either. \n\nRegardless, it's your money, your conditions. If she's not willing to listen to the customer experience, no amount of money in the world will save her business.", "NTA.

Because the problems you pointed out are so incredibly obvious, it's difficult to believe she's not aware of them. It sounds as though it's being managed by someone who doesn't really care whether it goes under.\n\n>She got very agitated at this and sarcastically asked how many restaurants I\u2019ve owned\n\nI'm wondering how many *successful* restaurants she's owned. Also none?\n\nNTA, I wouldn't lend her the money either. She has no idea how to run a business and she's rude into the bargain. It would be throwing good money after bad and I'm doubtful of her commitment to repay the loan.\n\nBut bad on both of you for turning a family into a business meeting.", "NTA Restaurants fail at a very high rate( sadly) that have perfect service, consistent food, and huge bankrolls. \n100k isn\u2019t a small amount of money and the restaurant can still fail( statistically success is stacked against it) YOU are taking the risk. You aren\u2019t asking for partnership status. You are stating some basic concerns.", "I don't know about everyone else here but I personally find it very inappropriate and crude for her to ask you for a loan at Sunday dinner around the rest of the family, and a $100k loan at that.  I'm guessing you're loaded if you've got that kind of money just lying around.  \n\nAdditionally, my philosophy is to NEVER truly lend family or friends money with the expectation of getting it back.  It won't happen.  Even if you still call it a \"loan,\" you might as well consider it a gift.", "NTA. Loans come with conditions, always. She may feel that yours are invasive, but lenders often require business to agree to some things that are relevant to the business's ability to repay the loan. You're allowed to say \"I'll risk my money for a business that does X, and not for a business that doesn't.\" She's free to reject the offer. That's it.", "NTA. Pouring a large sum into that restaurant without making adjustments as to how it is run would be bad business. I just wouldn't do it. Your DIL, being in the restaurant business, ought to know that there is no such thing as a free lunch. I very much doubt that she could get that kind of loan elsewhere completely without conditions.", "What exactly are her finances? You mentioned simple minor issues however the bigger question is where did the money go & what is her business plan? Why in the world would anyone even consider offering a sizable loan without knowing where the money goes? Just go throw your money in the ocean. It will be a quicker, less painful loss.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe's only asking for a loan *because the flaws you listed are the source of her money hemorrhage*.\n\nTbh I bet she got defensive because she hired in friends, and she's grasping at straws to avoid the inevitable impending conflict.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t need to run a restaurant to know the food isn\u2019t good, service is bad, and the place is dirty. If anything, she should appreciate the insight given she admits it\u2019s inconsistent. Throwing more money at it won\u2019t solve the problems listed unless she plans to fire everyone and start new with a better team and better pay rate. If you want to keep the peace, apologize for over stepping and she is right it\u2019s her business to run how she wants. But let her know you thought it over and it\u2019s too much money to lend to family and you don\u2019t want it to cause further issues than it has. If she has a solid plan to improve, she can get approval from a bank.", "NTA, and you're better than me. If I was asked \"how many restaurants have you owned?\" I'd have answered \"None. How many $100,000 loans have you given to relatives?\" \n\n\nIf you loan money to a business that's not striving to achieve and in fact is operating at a loss, that's not a loan. That's throwing good money after bad into a pit that will never return the investment. You were kind enough to offer a loan with minor conditions, much like a bank would, and it's DILs loss if she doesn't accept. I can't understand how anyone could be split on this?!", "NTA. She's running a failing business and can't get a loan from anywhere else, this is why she's come to family. She's overextended and didn't appreciate your comments because it makes it obvious she's the problem, and she doesn't want to take accountability.\n\nAny money she gets will never be seen again, and I doubt her business is worth $100k, never mind the rest of the money she undoubtedly owes other official channels.", "NTA You've never run a restaurant, but you don't need to, to know what you expect when visiting a restaurant as a customer. Until she addresses why her restaurant is failing it's stupid to.just keep throwing money at it.", "If a business is doing bad, losing money putting more money into it and not making changes (fixing the problems) it will continue to lose money. She will never be able to repay your loan. A good restaurant will listen to its customers that is why they read Google reviews. If she was running the restaurant successfully then she wouldn't need your advice or money. Tell her you are correct I don't run a restaurant to give you advice. I also am not a banker to give out loans, if you need a loan I suggest you go speak to a bank.", "Neither an asshole nor a lender be.\n\n**NTA**", "NTA\n\nShe said herself the restaurant is inconsistent and you as a customer experienced it first hand. As an owner she should appreciate your loan offer and also the feedback. I mean of course there are strings attached with 100 000 dollars - nobody just lends out money (except banks expecting a high interest rate :D) \n\nIn my opinion it\u2019s better to not loan the money. You probably won\u2019t see it again and it will cause a greater rift in the family as there already is.", "NTA - thats quite the chunk of change to ask for without any follow up questions and concerns", "Its 100k!!!! Its a lot of money! Its your money! You should absolutly ask questions about how this money is gonna be used and trying to understand if this \"loan\" is gonna ever be paid for! \n\nShe burn her and your son savings, so she clearly has no idea how to run a restaurant despite having one. \n\n1. Dont loan money to family. \n2. Dont loan money to a business that has no sign of getting better in the future\n3. Dont loan money without asking questions and putting on paper\n4. Dont loan money to entitled and rude people\n\nSave yourself and your son and your relationship a big problem: dont loan her any money!!!\n\n>I haven\u2019t heard from my son\n\nProbably is ashamed about his wife behaviour, business skills and about his savings being over.\n\nEdit to add: NTA", "NTA she is asking for a loan to prop up a failing business. As an investor you have a right to make some contingencies in exchange for helping her out.  If she doesn\u2019t like it she is welcome to find investors elsewhere.", "NTA. Tell her to go to the bank and get a loan there.", "NTA", "I adore my mother in law but I could never imagine walking up to her and asking her for \u00a3100,000!!   \n\n\nAnyway NTA, you're technically making an investment in the place until she pays you back why shouldn't you be able to give input on where you feel she's going wrong. You may not have owned a restaurant but you are a customer who's giving an honest review. If she doesn't take feedback on board her restaurant will likely always be a flop.", "Obviously NTA, $100,000 is probably a fair percentage of what the business is worth; you need to protect your investment\n\nAny financial institution would look for changes for such a loan, especially after they went through the books\n\nI\u2019d stick to your guns if I were you, this might be a The Producers situation", "NTA. How many restaurants has she run? And $100,000 is a ridiculously high amount. She won\u2019t pay it back. She just wants to pretend to play restaurant for a while longer", "Nta- that's a significant amount of money. I wouldn't loan anything without a written and signed agreement that you get some say because you would be her investor and the one keeping her afloat", "Any commercial lender, or bank, would ask the same questions.   That's capitalism.", "NTA. It sounds like she essentially wants you to become a silent partner. However, with how she has been running things I doubt she is willing to draw up legally binding contracts stating your responsibilities to each other. With an investment of that size, I don't blame you for wanting to have a say in how the business is run. You would be blindly throwing money into a failing business. Her attitude is a prime example of why going into business with family is usually a bad idea.", "Any investment firm or VC would demand to have a list of business proposals on how the business intends to right the ship. If that's not given and executed, the investors don't give a cent towards said business. You're free to offer loans with contingencies. It's the smart thing to do. She's free to deny said contingencies, so no loan.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She is not entitled to your money. She can go get a bank loan if it's that dire. I'm not a banker, but I bet any loan she gets is going to have conditions attached to it beyond just repayment terms, so she's in for a rude awakening.", "NTA. 100K is not a loan, it's an investment. And, as an investor, you have a vote on how your money will be used.", "Nope. NTA. Your money. Your choice. One cannot ask someone to invest in their businesses and simultaneously reject constructive criticism. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThat is not how life works. The reason her business has not been successful is due to the issues you pointed out. She needs to breathe and take a deep dive and address the problems head on. If not she kisses the money she invested goodbye.", "NTA. The issues you listed clearly impact the success of the restaurant and she is obviously not willing to listen to constructive criticism that might help her save the restaurant. I think you would be foolish to loan her this money. When the restaurant fails, you will be behind a long list of creditors to recover your money, and you are unlikely to do so. If you consider going through with this, please talk to an attorney and get proper loan papers, drawn up. But honestly, I think I would tell her that, after careful consideration and consultation with your financial advisor that you were unable to offer her the money.", "NTA\n\nYou can decide under what terms you will loan YOUR money. She either needs to agree or find someone else (an actual bank) to loan her the money.", "NTA\n\nBeggars are not choosers. Ever wonder why she didn't get a loan from a bank?", "NTA Her business is a disaster bc she can\u2019t run a business - from what you described. Don\u2019t give her money. You may as well flush it.", "NTA, a bank doesn't give you a loan if you're a gambler. This is called risk management. You saw her restaurant and saw no future in it. That means it's a bad investment and she's not trustworthy to be able to pay you back. So, you'd basically be giving her 100k for her to blow through (like her savings) and then you're 100k in a hole. That's called risk management, she's unreliable to be able to pay you back. \n\nTL", "So did she think you would just invest 100,000 into a business, and not say anything? I doubt the business is worth that much. I wouldn\u2019t give her any money, she needs to learn the hard way.", "NTA.  She doesn't want you telling her what to do but she wants to tell you what to do with YOUR money.  You know that if you give her the \"loan\" without any changes to a failing restaurant, she'll burn through the money and just need more.  It's a black hole.  Just say no.", "NTA\n\nReturn the favor about the restaurant question and ask how many 100.000$ she got? \n\nIf i were to \"loan\" that kind of money i sure would ask questions to determine when and how i can expect the repayment.", "NTA- you could\u2019ve given her the money but if the service and cleanliness didn\u2019t change, then the customer footfall wouldn\u2019t have improved. You would be wasting your money and they would have never paid it back. It was a bad investment. \n\nYou may not have ever run a restaurant, but not has any customer eating there, and if they felt the same way about the food and toilets, they wouldn\u2019t come back either.", "NTA. You may not have run a restaurant before, but you have eaten in plenty. Her issue is that business is inconsistent. Well, it's because of all the things you mentioned you saw as a customer, why her business sucks. If you want to throw money away, at least give it to someone who could use it and value it the way it should be. There are plenty of people out there who would appreciate it and take your advice. Honestly, loaning to a stranger would be less risk than loaning to your DIL. She needs to listen to your advice or you don't invest. You are not wrong.", "You ate there, saw some very easy fixes that they simply won't accomodate to help with the success of the business.\n\nThe conclusion is that with her closed mind, the loan would be basically throwing 100k away.\n\nIt's a no brainer.\n\nThink.about the strain this could have on your relationship with your son if not already.\n\nNote: she sounds like a c word\n\nNta", "NTA customers will complain. No one wants to spend their hard earned money at a restaurant that\u2019s dirty and has crappy service. The changes that need made the health department should probably know about", "I would not give her the loan - you can kiss it goodbye if you do.", "NTA. If I ask my bank for a loan, they attach conditions. (And they charge interest) I'm assuming that she wouldn't be able to get a bank loan, so your chances of seeing your money back are low.

You are old enough to have heard the refrain \"NEVER GO INTO BUSINESS AND/OR LOAN MONEY TO FAMILY MEMBERS\".\n\nBut NTA. \n\nIf she presses you, tell her that is what banks are for.  To me, it sounds like the restaurant is failing and she needs cash to keep it floating, but that will only delay the inevitable, so if you loaned her the money, you are going to lose it.", "NTA.\nYour DIL sounded very obnoxious and entitled. \nShe needs to see that one video where the guy tells about the client that never came back, it is really good for business owners and employees. \nShe as a business owner should have received your feedback bc when you saw those things you saw them as a client\u2019s perspective, and if anyone would put that amount of money in a business (even a loan) they should have the right to speak about the perceived problems.", "NTA.\nIf DIL wants a loan for operating expenses and doesn't have a list of changes she is making to recover the business you're better off putting your money in the fireplace and lighting it up.\n\nHer reaction to your suggestions indicate she has no clue what she is doing and frankly, the business should be shut down, take the losses and DIL move on.  \n\nThe only way you would be an AH in this situation is if you loaned her any money.", "NTA\n\nHonestly those are things she should try to\nfix anyway, and there is nothing that wouldn't show up in a Yelp review. \n\nDIL doesn't like being called out for running a subpar restaurant, but any investor would want those things fixed.", "NTA. She can call Restaurant Impossible for help as the bank of FIL/MIL is now closed.", "NTA\n\nYou've never owned a restaurant but you've eaten at a bunch.

I\u2019ve eaten there when I visited their city and was not impressed. The food is decent but inconsistent and that\u2019s about the only good thing I can say about her place. The soup is always lukewarm and sometimes the dishes are hotter than the food. The staff was rude and spent most of their time either on their phone or in groups talking. This meant it took longer than necessary to clean tables after diners have already left. On my last visit, the table next to me was empty yet full of dirty dishes for the duration of my meal. The restroom was never clean on any of my visits and was out of soap more times than it had soap. \n\nLast night, I had my children and their families over for Sunday dinner. During this visit, my DIL asked me for a $100,000 loan for her restaurant. She told me how her business is inconsistent and that\u2019s caused her to burn through their savings. We spoke for awhile until I offered to loan it to her but with some changes. I told her about the problems I listed above and options on how to fix them. She got very agitated at this and sarcastically asked how many restaurants I\u2019ve owned. I didn\u2019t appreciate her response so I answered, \u201cnone but I\u2019ve never sky dived before but know enough to not jump out of a plane without a parachute\u201d. \n\nThat got the attention of everyone at the dinner table. Eventually she said the restaurant is hers, she doesn\u2019t need suggestions from someone who\u2019s never ran one before (I\u2019ll give her this point), and that I\u2019m a control freak to try to tell her what to do with her own business. At this point I withdrew my loan offer and dinner was pretty much over and they left to go home instead of the original plan of staying until Tuesday.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard from my son this morning but his siblings are split on the issue. Some said it\u2019s my choice to loan or not loan her the money but I shouldn\u2019t tell her what she needs to do. Others said that I\u2019m right that if I\u2019m putting my money at risk, I have a say on how she\u2019s running her place.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is her choice to refuse, but if she can't see what the problems are in her restaurant then she has no business running one.", "NTA.\n\nBUT, it sounds like some clarification and strategy are needed on both sides.\n\nFor starters, prior to giving her advice, I'd set some ground rules; First, there is major risk when it comes to money (especially that amount) and family. Business transactions that can go south have the potential to ruin family relationships, you don't want that, so there should be a clear-cut boundary separating the two, and a contract with clear terms that can be referenced if the waters get muddy and personal relations start to become impacted. At the end of the day, neither has the right to be upset if there are clear terms to reference.\n\nSecond, you, as the investor need clarity from her what kind of business relationship she is seeking by asking for that amount of money. Is she wanting you to be an angel investor (where equity in the business is exchanged for capital and can be bought back later), a passive investor (supplies capital, but has no say in Operations), or an active investor (supplies capital and has a say in Operations)? Then once she clarifies, are you comfortable with that? Once you get on the same page the expectations are set to whether or not you have an active role or even simply an adviser role to provide feedback and she can't be upset about it. Is there any upside for you in terms of receiving a percentage of growth or profits? Those are all details that need to be discussed long before giving advice on how to run the restaurant.\n\nOr is she wanting a loan that she simply pays back with no interest? Because that's a massive ask with only downside risk for you, and total upside for her - Especially considering she openly admitted that 1) Her restaurant is inconsistent 2) She's burned through all of her savings, meaning that in order to repay you, consistency (which she already lacks) isn't sufficient, she actually needs to scale and grow revenues in order to afford to be profitable AND repay the loan. \n\nThe fact that you have the money to provide to her in the amount of $100k leads me to assume that you've had some level of success in your life, so it's silly for her to try and throw the \"you've never run a restaurant\" shit in your face, because good principles are typically applicable across industries and if she thinks a failing inconsistent restaurant somehow equates to her being viewed as an expert that has no need for feedback then perhaps she should give up on running any kind of business because that's a serious sign of lacking awareness.\n\nSo, to summarize, NTA, and I don't think you're in the wrong for providing feedback, but I think ironing out details and setting expectations sets you up for success in providing that feedback vs her building up the courage to ask you for money and then feeling defensive because the immediate reaction is pointing out gaps.", "Lukewarm dishes and out of soap are more than just bad execution, they are health code violations. Your concerns are basic restaurant 101 stuff. I would avoid any loans just on the basis that she is not teachable and cannot execute.\n\nIt was also a low class move to ask you for the loan in front of family. That forced you to voice your concerns in front of family, which probably embarrassed her and made her defensive. It caught you off guard, and rightfully so. With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been best to reply and tell her that you will discuss this in private.\n\nAs an aside, if you get criticism from family about your decision, tell them to put their money where their mouths are. Tell them that you will consider matching whatever they are willing to \"loan.\" (Safe, 'cause you know that ain't gonna happen).", "This is long, so pour yourself a cup of tea or coffee:\n\nYour daughter in law sounds very defensive.  I wonder about the true state of affairs of her restaurant, as well as her being so guarded and lashing out at you.  \n\nYou might send a letter saying that you love her and your son, but that you can\u2019t loan her money until some of the issues you raised and raise are addressed.  \n\nIt\u2019s important to let her and your son know that you want the restaurant to succeed and that you truly care about the two of them, and their happiness.\n(in the present and in the future).  Toward that end, you would be happy to steer her toward someone that could advise her, and that you would be more than willing to possibly pay for the consultation.  After the consultation, if she is willing to make changes in her business, then you would consider lending her the money.  However the business and action plan needs to be rock solid, so that if things slip again, there is a plan in place to handle that eventuality with alacrity.  Your son and his wife need to be really honest with you about the state of the restaurant.  Have you checked any Google reviews about the restaurant?  Those can be quite telling.  \n\nShe needs to take a good look at the business, and a ruthless look at the management of the business itself, the staff, and how she intends to solve how she manages her restaurant from the top down, and the bottom up.   She needs to think about her own and your son\u2019s peace of mind, and if the restaurant is really worth it, or if she should cut her losses.  These are difficult decisions, I know. \n\nUltimately, you obviously care about your son and his partner\u2019s long term happiness.  Is owning a restaurant integral to their long term happiness?  Might you suggest advice from a counselor of sorts, as well as an attorney?  \n\nI am wondering if the restaurant has legal counsel, as well as an accountant on staff or on retainer.  Full forensics of day to day costs. Income and outgo and \nday to day management would no doubt help her tremendously. If she needs such a huge amount of money, things might be going south quickly and your $100,000.00 could be just a drop in the proverbial bucket.  Is she using this to cover payroll,  taxes, repairs or day to day expenses which are stretched to the limit.  She needs to be able to provide an inventory of financials for anyone who asks without self justification, or secrecy.  \n\nMany states in the USA paid restaurants and other businesses  recompense for losses incurred through the Covid Lockdown.  I am wondering if your daughter-in-law received government money for those losses, and how it was spent.\n\nAs a sidebar: I have a dear friend in Chicago who was a restaurant owner who recently passed away from complications from a virulent form  of cancer.  He was 58 years old.  My cousin in law worked for 25 years as a chef for him. The business struggled, though the food was incredible.  However through the years the accountant for the restaurant stole money through various accounting tricks, and it was almost impossible to penetrate the house of cards that comprised the financials, even though my friend hired an attorney to investigate the losses.  The unscrupulous accountant is at large at this point (possibly in Thailand).  At one time, my friend owned seven restaurants!  All very successful, until they weren\u2019t about three years ago when Covid hit.  \n\nMy dear friend died with absolutely nothing in his bank account.  He was a really good person, very trusting, very hardworking, however he lost everything by trying to keep his restaurant afloat no matter what.  He died with no money in the bank, and a tax lien on his townhouse. He had borrowed from the mortgage on his house to pay outstanding bills for his restaurant.\n\nIn conclusion,  I am hoping that once your daughter in law gets over her gratuitous, and prideful indignation, she will be willing to have a talk with you, and truly listen with empathy and deep understanding to your suggestions.  If she is this defensive, and this unwilling to look at the true state of things, I am not sure what else you can do, but stand by.  I also wonder how your son and your daughter are handling things financially at the present moment.  And if things are in shaky ground in order to keep the restaurant afloat.  You need to know the state of things as they are family, and you want the best for them.  No, you are not the \u201ca\u2014\u2014e\u201d\u2026.\n\nI think of Gordon Ramsey, and how he helps people turn their restaurants around by investigating everything from the kitchen set up, to decor, to day to day operations.
