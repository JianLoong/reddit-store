I live about 3 hours from my family and we live about 2 minutes from my in-laws. I see my in-laws way more often than my own family. However, I have had certain family members come and stay with me and I noticed after about 2-3 days, I would start to get kinda annoyed that they were still there. I felt guilty because it\u2019s my own family that I don\u2019t see very often but having an extra person in your space that normally isn\u2019t there for an extended amount of time can be draining. \n\nPlus, if your in-laws frequently change the amount of time they spend with you, that would be an extra layer of stress added.", "NTA\n\nIt's rude for people to invite themselves to your home, especially for longer visits.  \n\nMy recommendation:  Do nothing to prepare for their visit.  Don't wash the sheets for the guest bedroom, don't do extra grocery shopping, don't do extra cleaning.  Make plans for yourself that overlap with the visit.  For instance, go to your parents' home the day before Thanksgiving to help your Mom prepare (bake, meal prep, clean, etc...).  Maybe get up early on Black Friday and \"go shopping\" (even if that means something far more relaxing than actually shopping).  Don't go out of your way to cook for the ILs.  When they say that they're hungry, tell Hubby, \"Your Mom and Da are getting hungry.  What do you have planned for dinner\"\n\nBasically, if your husband wants to let his parents invite themselves to vacation in your home, he gets to do the physical and emotional labor to host them.  You don't expect him to do the heavy lifting to host your family, so there's no reason that he should expect you to take care of everything to host his.", "NAH.

They could stay for a night or two and then your husband could go home with them and spend a few extra nights there.", "OP, why don't you go visit your parents for the week?

When family members live closer though, that seems a bit much.   What exactly are the plans for this visit?   Will you be hosting a big dinner?  Are there other activities planned?   \n\nTBH, I don't think the fact that you see your family more often is unrelated.  I think there is a deeper issue with some resentment about the way you relate as a couple to both sides of the family.   Your family lives closer, do they come to visit or do things say on a Saturday or Sunday?   How often do you go to see his family?  How often have you gone with him for a day out there?  When/how have they overstayed their welcome?", "I\u2019d simply go away and stay at my parents house for the duration of the in-laws\u2019 visit.\n\nYou get to decompress and hubby gets to spend time with his parents.

They live 2 hours away, not 20. In my world, that\u2019s a day trip. I love seeing friends and family and hosting them a night or 2 but even my overseas friends only generally stay a few nights before going to see someone else.  And, when I go visit overseas, I\u2019ll bounce after 2 days from friend to friend so they don\u2019t get sick of me and I can maximize my visit.  The only exception was when my bestie and her family (who live 8 hours away booo) were home for a family wedding. While they stayed a week, we only saw them for a few days as they were busy with wedding stuff so the rule didn\u2019t count.", "Info: Would they be staying the entire day Wednesday and Sunday?\n\nGot to be honest here, the schedule you just described used to be my own & still is my siblings\u2019 Thanksgiving schedule: arrive Wednesday evening, visit Thursday through Saturday, and then leave either Saturday night or after breakfast on Sunday.

The most we ever did was overnight.   And we used to do that about every 6 weeks or so.   No way is 5 days necessary.
