I live about 3 hours from my family and we live about 2 minutes from my in-laws. I see my in-laws way more often than my own family.

I felt guilty because it\u2019s my own family that I don\u2019t see very often but having an extra person in your space that normally isn\u2019t there for an extended amount of time can be draining. \n\nPlus, if your in-laws frequently change the amount of time they spend with you, that would be an extra layer of stress added.", "NTA\n\nIt's rude for people to invite themselves to your home, especially for longer visits.  \n\nMy recommendation:  Do nothing to prepare for their visit.  Don't wash the sheets for the guest bedroom, don't do extra grocery shopping, don't do extra cleaning.  Make plans for yourself that overlap with the visit.  For instance, go to your parents' home the day before Thanksgiving to help your Mom prepare (bake, meal prep, clean, etc...).  Maybe get up early on Black Friday and \"go shopping\" (even if that means something far more relaxing than actually shopping).  Don't go out of your way to cook for the ILs.  When they say that they're hungry, tell Hubby, \"Your Mom and Da are getting hungry.  What do you have planned for dinner\"\n\nBasically, if your husband wants to let his parents invite themselves to vacation in your home, he gets to do the physical and emotional labor to host them.  You don't expect him to do the heavy lifting to host your family, so there's no reason that he should expect you to take care of everything to host his.", "NAH.

They could stay for a night or two and then your husband could go home with them and spend a few extra nights there.", "OP, why don't you go visit your parents for the week?

When family members live closer though, that seems a bit much.   What exactly are the plans for this visit?   Will you be hosting a big dinner?  Are there other activities planned?   \n\nTBH, I don't think the fact that you see your family more often is unrelated.  I think there is a deeper issue with some resentment about the way you relate as a couple to both sides of the family.   Your family lives closer, do they come to visit or do things say on a Saturday or Sunday?   How often do you go to see his family?  How often have you gone with him for a day out there?  When/how have they overstayed their welcome?", "I\u2019d simply go away and stay at my parents house for the duration of the in-laws\u2019 visit.\n\nYou get to decompress and hubby gets to spend time with his parents.

They live 2 hours away, not 20. In my world, that\u2019s a day trip. I love seeing friends and family and hosting them a night or 2 but even my overseas friends only generally stay a few nights before going to see someone else.  And, when I go visit overseas, I\u2019ll bounce after 2 days from friend to friend so they don\u2019t get sick of me and I can maximize my visit.  The only exception was when my bestie and her family (who live 8 hours away booo) were home for a family wedding.

The most we ever did was overnight.   And we used to do that about every 6 weeks or so.   No way is 5 days necessary.

You are not obligated to let them stay. \n\nWith all that said, you should definitely consider your options when it comes to your husband and his feelings. If you can\u2019t come to some sort of agreement or compromise, someone is going to end up unhappy and resentful.  \n\nThe biggest issue here is making sure that your in-laws don\u2019t take advantage as it seems that they do and that your husband lets them. There needs to be clear boundaries and exceptions adhered to. \n\nStill, I think you could have a little more compassion. Not saying you should give in and tolerate them coming to stay.

It\u2019s a long way to go there and back in one day and hard to make the time when everyone is free to get together to only see each other for a few hours before needing to leave again.

I think you need to chill and suck this one up. No one likes their inlaws. It's how it is.", "YTA I would leave you on the spot", "NAH. I get your husbands desire for a longer visit but also your desire to decompress and enjoy some part of the holiday without the added pressure of hosting. Hopefully you can find a compromise where they stay a day or two and you get some time to yourselves. Best of luck!", "YTA.  Does he pay part of the rent/mortgage and other bills?  He gets to invite people to his home.  \n\nI have a feeling he spends a lot more time with your family  than he foes his own.", "I mean depending on how old his parents are you can probably count down how many times he has left to see them honestly. For example if they are like 60 years old and you see them like once a year then he may have 20-30 more times to see them at the most if lucky. Soooo i mean is 5 days really that bad?", "OP check into a hotel for at least a few of the days and have your own mini vacation. He can deal with his parents on his own.\n\nNTA.", "I don\u2019t think staying for 5 days is a problem, but I also don\u2019t see why they need to given that 2 hours is a fairly short drive.", "Nah. I get it. Once a month my mil comes & stays a week. Every month. She stays in the bedroom 98% of the time she is here. She only comes out when I force her or to get coffee, soda or something. I used to bring it to her but realized I was making it easy for her but she\u2019s getting too damn comfortable in my home. \n But on the other hand, if your husband wants to host his family & do 100% of what comes with it, let him. Sadly, parents don\u2019t last forever & you only get 1 set.  Get you a mini fridge & a couple good books & a nice lock for your bedroom door", "NTA and 3 nights is plenty generous especially if they\u2019re 2 hours away. Also given that you know they have a habit of extending their stay, you are right to set that boundary. Good for you! Stand your ground!", "Honestly,  it's worth it to divorce just to never see those fuckers again.  Wish I had known this years earlier", "I seem to be the odd one out here\u2026 and maybe I\u2019m biased because I wish I could see my parents more, (they live states away and I see them twice a year at most)\u2026. But it\u2019s not going to kill you. It\u2019s family. It\u2019s the holidays.\n\nYour husband misses them and his parents miss the both of you. I\u2019d be so hurt and disappointed if my husband limited the days my parent\u2019s visited. 5 days isn\u2019t that long. It\u2019s not even a full week. \n\nBut I get you were looking forward to relaxing and not hosting/entertaining. \nMaybe ask your hubby to take them out on an all day outing doing whatever take them out to dinner and such, while you chillax at home. Or maybe you take off the last 2 days and spoil yourself at a hotel spa with your girlfriends, idk, something like that. \nSurely there is some kind of happy compromise here.", "Can I say how relieved I am to see this response. I empathise with OP as I can see similar scenarios playing out in our house. I am uncomfortable having people stay more than a day or two (though really a day), and resent that my holiday is sacrificed for theirs. As I was reading the post I thought for sure the comments were going to be that OP should deal with it, they\u2019re family, he doesn\u2019t see them often etc etc. These responses have validated my feelings, and I hope they have of OP too. Stand strong!", "THIS!!!!", "He needs to deep clean before they arrive. OP shouldn\u2019t lift a finger.", "We did this often before my mil died. She smoked and though we loved her, we did not love her house. Not only did we do this, we did this with out kids, of which we have 5 .", "Life is short time with loved ones is important. \n\nAlso realistically how much would you go to see your parents if their 2 hours away?", "Her edit confirms this. I think she should decompress in a hotel somewhere else, and he should have all the hosting put on him.", "Exactly! OP is doing all the cleaning and cooking, I\u2019m sure if that deferred to husband he would be exhausted. \n\nDef NTA", "Make your own plans and just vanish so he has to do the heavy lifting.", "This needs to be addressed, long-term. At the end of my marriage, my ex complained it was my fault he didn\u2019t see his parents more. We lived about 4 miles from them. When I told him he could see them anytime he wanted, he said he wanted me there as well so he could use me as an excuse to leave. \n\nIt was rediculous. Especially since I\u2019d often go see them\nwithout him. And besides, he had never even told me that. Just used it against me at the end.", ">but every visit has to be a whole weekend stay. \n\nTotally understandable. I wouldn't want to spend 4 hours in a car for a visit which only last a few hours. That would be ridiculous.", "It really boggles the mind when children want to maintain a relationship with toxic parents who are disrespectful to spouse and the marriage. No wonder it will hard to host them.", "Everyone can stay in a cheap hotel for a few days and pay it off over time with Klarna.", "That's where you say you \"forgot\" something in the car and have some throw down divorce papers with her signature already on it and bring them in and throw it down in front of them and demand he sign it. Look them straight in the eyes and say this is on you.", ">Stay at her parents.  Solved.\n\nPerhaps she would like to be able to just chill in her own home with all her stuff around her during her rare time off.", "This defeats the purpose of decompressing in her own home.", "Would they be welcome to stay for 5 days simply for a long visit?  And would your partner feel the same way?", "This! I love my bonus kids but at some point I was head chef and maid. This man only helped out when mommy was watching. So I stopped. Shit sat around for 3 days till he realized the lesson that was being taught, and mommy made comments every morning she picked up my daughter for school. The comment was, \"She isn't your maid, clean up after yourself\". You don't have to leave to send a message. A clear boundary is needed. If you want your parents here they are your responsibility, I'm on vacation. And then don't do shit."]}
