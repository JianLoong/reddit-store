Only he can regulate his emotional responses. His trying to coerce you to violate your boundaries for comfort and safety with the threat of hurting his own feelings about it is worth a sober conversation. You are not his by right. Your chosing not to lay down with a noisy drunken man is not \"taking away\" nor \"depriving\" him of a right to your body he seems to be trying to claim. Nip that entitlement in the bud.", "I wouldn't think you were an asshole if you didn't want to sleep in a bed with him at all. Humans do not sleep well with others in bed. You were sick. He left you to go out with his friends and then got mad at you when he disturbed you in your sleep making you leave. He's mad at your reactions to his actions. you are NTA at all\n\nalso there is nothing wrong with wanting to get a good night's sleep. you still love him. your wanting to sleep elsewhere is not for lack of love for him but for the need of your own well-being and health. good sleep is important, even more so when sick.\n\nyou guys should talk about this. How what he did made you feel. How you made him feel and all that. If you can get through it without fighting, I'd say that's a good sign.", "This post made me happy.  My husband smells awful the day after drinking, it\u2019s like a weird sweet smell.

A big boozy night has a bunch of crap that needs to be processed out the next day. It makes people smell! \n\nIt\u2019s a bit better if they do the work to stay hydrated and don\u2019t drink a ton of alcohol, but if they\u2019re throwing up they probably didn\u2019t keep that balance.", "NTA you set a boundary and kept it. Your bf threw up on the floor and wasn\u2019t going to clean up then tried to force you back in bed by telling you his feeling were more important than yours. That is a big \u2018no\u2019 right there and a red flag. I am a big believer that drunk or sober a person should be accountable for what they say, there is no \u2018I did not know what I was saying because I was drunk\u2019 excuses. There are a lot of red flags here.", "NTA", "Na, I always sleep on the couch when I'm pissed.\nI suffer from night toots!"]}
