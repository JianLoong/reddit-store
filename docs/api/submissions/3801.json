My son (15) doesn't like her food, he never outright said it and uses the phrase \"picky eater\" as justification to not eat what she cooks. I think that since he has no allergies then he should try to give it a chance at least. But no, he's always choosing to go through the trouble of finding other alternatives instead of eating what's ready at the table. This has took a mental toll on my wife even though I try to tell her constantly that he'll come around eventually.\n\n\n\nLast night, we were having dinner and I was able to get my son to sit down and eat with us but after he tasted the food, he said it was bad and that he'd prefer to eat his mom's leftover food that she sent for him the other day. My wife was obviously upset. I had a conversation with him later and decided to return the xbox I was planning to give him on christmas. He went nuts saying I was punishing him for \"being himself\" but I told him it was about the comment he made about my wife's food that she worked hard to make. He said it was unfair and that I was \"trying to be please\" my wife at his expanse. I refused to engage in the argument and he has been giving me the silent treatment even now. Except, he called me horrible and is telling me that I promised him the xbox and can't take it back now.", "created_utc": 1670026507, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb2inu/aita_for_returning_my_sons_christmas_gift_after/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And he is a teenager. \n\nWhile you said that you were going to gift him an xbox you can decide against it at anytime, for whatever reason.

Your son is 15, there is no reason he can\u2019t open his tastebuds to other types of food. Or better yet, he can cook himself if he\u2019s so picky. A kid not like a few choice foods or two is normal. Refusing to eat 70% of what\u2019s in front of them is partially the fault of parents too. You\u2019ve allowed him to think he can always have alternatives. Which yields results like this. \n\nYou\u2019re also TA. One for letting his excuse as a picky eater get this far. Two and primarily, you promised him an Xbox and now you\u2019re reneging.

The kid is having trouble.", "YTA for the millions of reasons already stated.", "Hell yeah YTA! Tell your wife not everyone will love her or her cooking. You chose her. Your Son did not. Don\u2019t get all pissy at him for having a preference for food he grew up eating over food he has to get used to now. Grow some balls and tell your wife to calm down. Have your Son\u2019s back and tell her he can eat whatever he wants to eat. Even if he has to cook it himself. But please teach your son to be civil at least. No need to be nasty.", "YTA\n\nPunishing your kid because your wife is a crappy cook? How is that right?", "YTA. It's a known fact he doesn't like your wife's cooking for some reason and thus feeds himself. By insisting he taste her food right in front of her, YOU created the situation that caused her hurt feelings, so if anyone deserves not to get a Christmas gift, it's you and you alone. \n\nKeep it up and he'll just stop coming over at all. You really willing to drive your son away over food? Because it's coming.", "Info:  Has he always been a picky eater or is this a new thing that suddenly happened when you got married?\n\nAlso, is she a good cook or could that really be an issue here?  Some people use spices, oils, or other ingredients that just turn some people off.  Onions are a prime example of that, among other things.  Some think it adds to the meal, others think it ruins it.\n\nIf it's new, it's probably a form of rebellion towards accepting her as his step-mom.  This is something you should nip in the bud.  Especially if he's subtly rejecting your wife in other ways, too.  Kids get weird about that stuff sometimes.  He needs to figure out that she's not replacing his mom, she's in it with your mom, too.  You're all on the same team.  Team [insert son's name here]!  Even if you don't get along with your ex, all three of you want what's best for your son, right?  \n\nMy daughter claims to not like my boyfriend's cooking at times, but she's usually just being a sourpuss towards him for something else.  Like, you forced me to do homework when I wanted to play, so I'm going to criticize your cooking type of mentality.\n\nIf your son's always been picky, it's time for him to let that go at 15.  Little kids kinda get a pass for being picky since they don't understand that you need to eat your veggies.  They don't think like that at all, plus the tantrums when they're little can be tough. Your son is 15 and picky eating shouldn't really stick around into the teens.  We all know plenty of adult picky eaters though.\n\nMy son tries that nonsense.  It's not my son \"being himself,\" it's him trying to get out of eating vegetables or healthy food.  His preference is only junk food, so we do not tolerate that pickiness.  \n\nCan you guys bridge the gap by trying to cook more of the meals he likes?  \n\nThat's what I do with my kids.  My son loves tacos, so I make healthier versions.  My issue is more with health, than hurt feelings, though.  I compromise with healthier versions of the junk food.", "YTA. I get it is frustrating. I have 2 picky kids too and it is a struggle. I have to make sure there is at least something that I know they will eat at the table and pretty much expect them to boycott any new recipes. So I may make curry because me and my husband like it but I will be sure there is rice and bread and a fruit they will eat also. When all else fails, my 12 year old will make herself a sandwich. Some people have texture sensitivities. I can\u2019t stand potatoes and onions because of the texture. Your taking away a teenagers Xmas present for something he can\u2019t help. Ease up.", "YTA for that and for thinking this is about food. This kid is 15, his parents are divorced and his dad re married a woman that takes the role of her mum when he's with you. Have you any idea what that is like? This is not about the food at all. \nHave a conversation with your son, he is not a child and deserves to be heard. It's awful when your parent makes you pretend for their partner, this will build up in years of resentment to the both of you.", "Yta. your son is honest. You should revel in that. It\u2019s not his fault your wife can\u2019t cook.", "YTA", "YTA. You basically set this whole situation up by forcing your son to sit down and eat food you know he didn't like. He tried to be nonconfrontational about it by just saying he was \"picky\"- it's not like he beelined to being mean. He's a kid and this is still a new situation for him. It could also be a situation of him feeling allegiance to his mother by enjoying her food and not wanting to have to get used to your wife's food. But either way... taking back the Christmas gift of a kid who's not acting malicious is just plain overkill, and cruel. \n\nI reiterate, this is a new situation for your son. You should be on his side, not the side of your new wife.", "So rather than just letting your son politely sidestep things and talking to your wife about getting over it(oohhh he doesn't like her food the world is gonna end), you forced him to eat her food and what? Expected him to lie about it? Punishing him for being honest about a situation you put him in is Grade A++ parenting there OP. And yes I was being sarcastic.\n\nYTA and this could have been avoided. You pushed it and this was the result.", "YTA. He tried to be tactful and non-confrontational. It sounds like he even brings his own food to so he\u2019s not causing a major inconvenience. The comment only came after you pressured him into eating food he didn\u2019t like. And then you walk back on a promise over it. \n\nYour wife needs to not take his pickiness personally, you need to not punish him for not liking her food, both of you need to let him do his own thing when it comes to food, and if she\u2019s that bad of a cook in general then that\u2019s something that should be handled between the two of you and not imposed on him.", "YTA. You genuinely suck. Other than the obvious which has been mentioned in other replies, have you even considered this has more to do with the divorce and how it\u2019s affecting your son? I\u2019m guessing no. Also, is your new wife putting forth any effort?", "YTA . Get over it \u2026 you can\u2019t force someone to like your wife\u2019s cooking .

There's nothing she can do to make your son happy. My parents divorced when I was 15 and my mom remarried right away, and no matter how nice or good my new step dad was he couldn't replace my dad so it was pointless for him to try.

Would you like to life where you are fed food you hate daily? I would not. I would fast for several days before i eat eggplant because that stuff is gross. If my parents where divorced and 1 side forced me to eat that stuff.... i would be with the other side and wild horses would not be able to drag me back.", "Boo", "He shouldn\u2019t be forced to eat something he doesn\u2019t like.  How does your knowledge as a \u201cdoctor\u201d decide that forcing a child to eat food they do not like is beneficial??", "He literally are leftovers that his mom sent with him. That fits the definition of \"eating what's available to him.\" I hope to God you're not actually a doctor since you're out here advocating for behavior that causes disordered eating.", "That sounds awesome but do you really think that op was being fed gruel or just trying to be difficult? If i tried to make a sandwich after my mother cooked it would not have went over very well.", "Maybe she's not a bad cook but she's a bad stepmom.", "Someone who's attempting to stroke his wife's ego", "Absolutely. Many kids go through a phase of not wanting vegetables and are often forced to eat them despite not wanting it. It\u2019s for their own good. If his stepmom is providing a well rounded diet then he should be able to give a genuine effort eat it. If he doesn\u2019t like the way it\u2019s seasoned then he could always add that in it himself. Or he could try to work with her on how some things are prepared so he isnt hurting her feelings every time. Now theoretically, it isn\u2019t his job to salvage her feelings. But it is just fundamentally hurtful to shoot someone down who is making an effort to do something kind for you (i.e. her preparing his meals). Theoretically, he could always make his own food, but I\u2019m not going to make assumptions that they are in a financial situation for that to always be a viable option.", "#child development milestones", "yes, actually i do think it\u2019s okay.  it\u2019s a small step to understanding that not everything in life is going to be individually-tailored to him.  ps.  this scenario also does not meet clinical criteria for mental abuse.", "Overly sensitive, maybe\u2026but not enough evidence to show she\u2019s a bad stepparent based on what we were told.", "This isn't a kid throwing a tantrum over brussel sprouts. \n\nThis is about the wife's ego. If they're attempting to blend the family this isn't the way to do it. OP just insured that his son lessens his own visits.", "Don\u2019t actual doctors recommend that you communicate with your child to understand them rather than just punishing them as a way to correct behaviour? Especially when the kid just entered a new family set-up?\n\nWhat about parental trust building? \n\nHow is he learning respect here? He\u2019s learning to lie.", "The kid is old enough to decide what they want to eat.", "If him not wanting to eat her food is taking a mental toll on her, then she's not a good stepmom. Her over sensitivity is leading her husband to punish his child for not liking her food.", "then he is old enough to earn the money to buy his own food.  i\u2019m not draconian but this is all first world issues.  a 15yo is old enough to be respectful and try new foods.", "I really hope you don't have children with this dictator mindset", "He chose to make leftovers instead??  Like what are you trying to argue at this point??\n\nHe didn\u2019t like her cooking.  Chose to make leftovers instead.  What should he do instead??  Eat food he dislikes to appease somebody??", "He DID try it. He didn't like it. He found something else to eat. All reasonable actions.", "You missed the part in the original post where it was stated that he\u2019s already providing his own food. So your doctor status still isn\u2019t right or necessary here.", "He had other options and was choosing those other options and they were being taken away from him out of spite.\n\nSeems like it's more than the kid that has developmental issues here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I've said to several other people:Rule Number 1 about gifts:Gifts are never conditional. Making gifts conditional is the quickest way to teach your children to never trust you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs parental trust building one of your developmental milestones?", "lol.  i have 5.  and none of them would ever do this.  not because they are too scared to speak out but because they understand & genuinely enjoy a home cooked meal and family time.  respect and boundaries are important.  again, first world issues.", "disagree."]}
