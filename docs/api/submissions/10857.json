Everything was fine and good until my husband left the bar to go to the restroom, came back and walked out the door with the woman we were having a business conversation with (one of the two friends). Her friend wound up leaving her because she was tired of waiting while we talked about business.\n\nI was at the bar still drinking what was left of my water while waiting for another glass of water from the bartender. I look outside from the bar and see my husband is walking side by side with the woman towards our car (obviously without me). I got up and left to catch up to him, valet has our car pulled up with the passenger door open.\n\nAs we are heading home, I asked my husband why he left the restaurant without me, he became defensive while giving me some excuse that he \u201cthought I was walking behind them\u201d, yet he never turned to check or verify that I was actually with them. While this may seem insignificant, I know my husband and it is unusual for him to leave any place without making sure that I was beside him, so of course this took me by surprise.\n\nTo make matters worse, as we\u2019re driving and discussing the situation my husband says, \u201cI don\u2019t know why the valet had the car ready with the passenger door open even though I was leaving with a different woman\u201d. That FURTHER let me know that he was aware that I wasn\u2019t with him, so now I\u2019m more pissed!\n\nWas I wrong for being pissed that my husband ditched me and calling him out on it? Should he get a pass because alcohol was involved? Thus has never happened before, I feel that if the roles were reversed and I walked to my car with another man without my husband he would be equally upset. We got into an argument because I felt like he was dismissive and acting as if I was overreacting, I wound up sleeping in a different room.\n\nWe are not swingers, and this is very unusual behavior and has never happened in the 10 years we\u2019ve been together.", "created_utc": 1677303096, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bd3ny/aita_for_calling_my_husband_out_on_leaving_the/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's pretty weird that he didn't notice his WIFE wasn't with him and he left with another woman. And the valet opening the door is even more suspicious.", "NTA. I feel something pretty weird was going on with him. It wasn't like he just went off to a bar and went home with a woman. You both went to a bar and then he just left you behind? If it was intentional then that is very bad. If it wasn't intentional it is pretty bad in a completely different way. Either way you definitely need to talk to him", "NTA. No husband would ever leave his wife alone in the bar. If ever that happens like in this context, start contemplating your relationship.", "NTA. His behavior is obviously super sketchy, and you need to keep your eyes wide open for more red flags.", "NTA. He had a buzz, or was drunk, and just completely forgot about you. They both probably had malicious intent, the only thing is, there\u2019s enough rope for him to reasonably deny malicious intent when he sobers up. Either way you have to make a BIG DEAL out of this. I\u2019m not with the current Reddit trend to leave a marriage or split with family at the 1st sign of trouble. But you do have to make a lot of noise about this so that A) he never eveeerrr forgets about doing this bullshit again for the rest of his life and B) you get a barometer on how much respect he has for you, because even if I legitimately got so intoxicated that I forgot about my SO with no ill intent behind it, I would still feel a tremendous amount of guilt for making her feel unwanted or ignored and would be on my knees apologizing for at least a couple days. Hubby need be in the dog house for this one.", "NTA.  You already know this.  Whether you are the a55h0le isnt what you should be questioning.\n\nThe question you should be asking yourself is do you really want to continue forward with a husband ditches you at a bar, while leaving with another woman and who cannot.provide a plausible explanation for doing so .

You sure he\u2019s not regularly hitting on women when you\u2019re not around because he seems pretty comfortable doing it even when you\u2019re around.

As they were walking toward the car the valet driver opened the passenger door. I walked out shortly after and heard him offering her a ride because her friend had left her (she got tired of waiting while we talked). In response to my husbands offer I heard her say, \u201cno I\u2019m the one who drove\u201d while walking over to her own car. \nI was buzzed when I posted this so I\u2019m now questioning my own thoughts and perception on what actually went down.", "Unpopular opinion here but based on what we actually know, NAH.\n\nYou all were standing near the door and had gotten your coats on, your car was already pulled up by the valet, I don\u2019t find it that implausible that he zoned out and didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d stopped to get more water. Maybe he got indignant because he was actually embarrassed at having zoned out so much, and/or ashamed because such a lapse in awareness probably indicated he was too inebriated to safely drive. \n\nMy guess is he was absorbed in the conversation (y\u2019all talked long enough for her friend to leave, so I\u2019m guessing it was pretty engaging), saw the car ready, knew you\u2019d been there putting your coat on just prior, and went into autopilot walking to meet the valet; or maybe he was attracted to her and got distracted/flustered, and too embarrassed/ashamed to want to admit that. But if he\u2019s never ever done anything like this before, I doubt that it was some out-of-nowhere power play our effort to ditch you. I do think he should have been more validating of your discomfort, but I can see why someone who thinks you should know them would be hurt that you assumed they deliberately tried to leave with another woman right in front of you, if that isn\u2019t something they would do.\n\nWith that said, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong being bothered by what happened. And it could be there was something inappropriate going on, so definitely look for other red flags you may have ignored\u2026 just try not to leap to the worst possible interpretation without good reason. This is Reddit, and we\u2019re only hearing this story from your already-suspicious narration; folks are going to be happy to jump to the most dramatic interpretations because it makes for a more entertaining story, and because they only know this 60-second excerpt of your 10-year marriage. If he\u2019s been wonderful for10 years, this would be too big and sudden a change in character for me to think that\u2019s the most likely interpretation.", "DIVORCE.", "I'm sorry that you're being treated like this. Time to protect yourself. Start with your husband's phone. Anyone who blathers to you about marital trust and communication can stuff it. Your husband has already thrown that by the wayside with evasive, nonsensical answers. Shady behavior deserves shady repsonse.\n\nAlso, was your husband just going to leave you carless at the bar while he went off with another woman? There is absolutely no acceptable explanation for that. It's either buying drugs, or an affair.", "NTA. Im wondering if this is so out of character for him, and his responses are foggy, If the girl slipped him something in his drink????", "NTA because he was rude as fuck, but honestly I doubt he was trying anything with this woman. I mean how stupid would he have to be to try to pick up another woman when you are with him? I think this was horribly crass and rude of him and that is bad enough, but to me it's not an indication of cheating.", "Nta and I wouldn\u2019t give him a pass!

I was standing at the bar drinking water, I turned around and saw them walking toward our car (the valet brought the car up because we had shut the place down). I ran behind them to catch up and heard him offering her a ride (because the friend left), she declined stating that she was the one who drove and walked over to her own car.

Who drove?", "How long was he missing with this woman if her friend got tired of waiting and left her there?", "When we were talking he asked if she had a card because she\u2019s affiliated with a company we contract with, she didn\u2019t have one with her but asked if we had linked in, I gave her my phone and she added me there. \nI won\u2019t ask her as I don\u2019t want her to feel awkward, I don\u2019t think she did anything wrong, I\u2019m upset with his behavior.", "He wasn\u2019t missing with her, the three of us were conversing about business, the friend was annoyed because she was ready to leave so she stood away from us on the other side of a post. The friend left, she went after her friend I think and my husband walked out with her. I had turned towards the bar to get a drink of water, the bartender noticed I was low on water and topped my water up, when I turned around I noticed they were outside walking toward our car, which I immediately went out after them.", "I can't get over the fact that he was driving after drinking. That's such an extremely irresponsible thing to do.", "Ohhh ok! Thank you for clarifying!"]}
