Everything was fine and good until my husband left the bar to go to the restroom, came back and walked out the door with the woman we were having a business conversation with (one of the two friends). Her friend wound up leaving her because she was tired of waiting while we talked about business.\n\nI was at the bar still drinking what was left of my water while waiting for another glass of water from the bartender. I look outside from the bar and see my husband is walking side by side with the woman towards our car (obviously without me). I got up and left to catch up to him, valet has our car pulled up with the passenger door open.\n\nAs we are heading home, I asked my husband why he left the restaurant without me, he became defensive while giving me some excuse that he \u201cthought I was walking behind them\u201d, yet he never turned to check or verify that I was actually with them. While this may seem insignificant, I know my husband and it is unusual for him to leave any place without making sure that I was beside him, so of course this took me by surprise.\n\nTo make matters worse, as we\u2019re driving and discussing the situation my husband says, \u201cI don\u2019t know why the valet had the car ready with the passenger door open even though I was leaving with a different woman\u201d. That FURTHER let me know that he was aware that I wasn\u2019t with him, so now I\u2019m more pissed!\n\nWas I wrong for being pissed that my husband ditched me and calling him out on it? Should he get a pass because alcohol was involved? Thus has never happened before, I feel that if the roles were reversed and I walked to my car with another man without my husband he would be equally upset. We got into an argument because I felt like he was dismissive and acting as if I was overreacting, I wound up sleeping in a different room.\n\nWe are not swingers, and this is very unusual behavior and has never happened in the 10 years we\u2019ve been together.", "created_utc": 1677303096, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bd3ny/aita_for_calling_my_husband_out_on_leaving_the/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's pretty weird that he didn't notice his WIFE wasn't with him and he left with another woman. And the valet opening the door is even more suspicious.", "NTA. I feel something pretty weird was going on with him. It wasn't like he just went off to a bar and went home with a woman. You both went to a bar and then he just left you behind? If it was intentional then that is very bad. If it wasn't intentional it is pretty bad in a completely different way. Either way you definitely need to talk to him", "NTA. No husband would ever leave his wife alone in the bar. If ever that happens like in this context, start contemplating your relationship.", "NTA. His behavior is obviously super sketchy, and you need to keep your eyes wide open for more red flags.", "NTA. He had a buzz, or was drunk, and just completely forgot about you. They both probably had malicious intent, the only thing is, there\u2019s enough rope for him to reasonably deny malicious intent when he sobers up. Either way you have to make a BIG DEAL out of this. I\u2019m not with the current Reddit trend to leave a marriage or split with family at the 1st sign of trouble. But you do have to make a lot of noise about this so that A) he never eveeerrr forgets about doing this bullshit again for the rest of his life and B) you get a barometer on how much respect he has for you, because even if I legitimately got so intoxicated that I forgot about my SO with no ill intent behind it, I would still feel a tremendous amount of guilt for making her feel unwanted or ignored and would be on my knees apologizing for at least a couple days. Hubby need be in the dog house for this one.", "NTA.  You already know this.  Whether you are the a55h0le isnt what you should be questioning.\n\nThe question you should be asking yourself is do you really want to continue forward with a husband ditches you at a bar, while leaving with another woman and who cannot.provide a plausible explanation for doing so .  Is that what you want for the rest of your life?", "NtA.  But what was his end game here? \n\nDitching you so he could go cheat, while you uber home? Was this the plan?", "NTA", "NTA. Something off about his actions. How did the woman react when she saw you? Was she going to get in the car with him? Idk, seems very sketchy.

We were getting ready to leave, I had out my coat on, but the three of us stood there talking for a good 5-10 more mins before they walked out. \n\nI can\u2019t remember what led to them walking out, I think the woman realized her friend left without her (because she got tired of waiting) and went outside to find her.

I walked out shortly after and heard him offering her a ride because her friend had left her (she got tired of waiting while we talked).
