Massive red flag for the future. I don't understand why she's trying to compete for your attention with your 5 year old son. If it's going to start now, it's only going to get worse in the future. \n\nI understand that when you have someone move in with you, there's some periods of adjustment. However, you should always put your kid first. This isn't you ignored an awards ceremony to take your kid to the park. This was your kid wanting cuddles in the middle of the night. \n\nI would think have a problem with you if you ignored your son for her.", "NTA - what did she want you to do differently? Not cuddle your child?? If that\u2019s the case - massive \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9", "This is a tough one but as a step parent, I am going to say NTA but also she isn\u2019t either. It\u2019s important to have a space that is just your and your partner\u2019s especially when so much of your life is being dictated by people who aren\u2019t in your relationship like kid\u2019s schedules, ex\u2019s whims. My parents were not divorced but we stayed out of my parents\u2019 bedroom it was their space away from us when they needed a break or to spend time with just each other. Kids are often the same way about their own room as well it\u2019s a safe space. Being a step parent is already a tough role to fill because you are often living a contradiction. Could she have handled it a bit better yes but that doesn\u2019t mean her feelings aren\u2019t valid. I don\u2019t think it is from a place of jealousy but instead a place of already feeling like your life and decisions are not your own and now not even the bed you are intimate in is just your own. I would suggest next time giving her a quick kiss and taking your kid to cuddle in their room. Let your bed be for the two of you, give yourselves a space that is just for the two of you. You guys def need to talk more about it and find something everyone is comfortable with. And please encourage her to look at the step parents Reddit.", "NTA\n\nI'm assuming that you didn't *actually* push her off of the bed when you moved over to make room for your son? \n\nI know that couples have different boundaries about kids coming into their beds at night, but if you and your son have an established understanding that he's welcome to come in when needed, then I think this is a conversation that you and your partner need to have immediately. The fact that she's framing it as a rejection rather than an inconvenience or annoyance would be a red flag for me.", "NTA \nSo, you\u2019ve been living together for 2 months and this one time your son wants a morning cuddle and she\u2019s upset? Yeah, definite red flag. Not sure you need to toss her out right away, but she needs to understand that kids need cuddles when they need cuddles. Have a chat with her when tempers have cooled and let her blood is, and will always be, thicker than water.", "NTA, this is a huge red flag!", "NTA. \n\nJust a note though - it's super common for step-parents to feel weird about a child in bed with them, even if they're on the other side. It can feel like an invasion of privacy and a dedicated relationship space. \n\nI don't think she handled it well, and it definitely warrants another conversation. I would approach this as 'can you explain again what felt off to you this morning', then explain your side of it, and negotiate a compromise? Using phrases like \"you knew he comes first\" etc etc are unhelpful so I'd stay away from them.\n\nAnd I disagree that this is necessarily the end of your relationship. There are many excellent loving and caring step-parents who have a hard boundary around children in the bedroom for their own sanity. If this is the case with her, the option might be you taking son back to his room and jumping in his bed for cuddles. \n\nFYI  I'm the 30 something female in a relationship with a man and 5yo son comes in for morning cuddles all the time. I personally don't mind but that comes from lots of other factors including my exposure to younger siblings etc.", "INFO\n\nWhat was she expecting? \n\nDid you actually shove her at all (even by accident) when your pushed back to let your son into the bed?\n\nHad you been cuddling her when your son came in?\n\nDoes she not understand that your son, at 5, definitely takes priority in that situation?\n\nWere you dismissive of her concerns, or did you try to explain that there was nothing you could do and it was nothing against her?", "INFO: when you scootched to make room, did you stay on your half of the bed? Did you bump her? I could see where she's coming from if you physically made her less than. If not....it's pretty irrationally possessive.", "NTA, this is a big warning sign. She\u2019s feeling insecure and trying to push into the space you have for your son. I would suggest going to couples counseling as this is a difficult situation to navigate alone.

This couldn\u2019t be a bigger red flag if she chucked a bucket of red paint over herself.

What a huge blaringly loud red flag", "NTA - your son is more important. She threw a tantrum and acting jealous of a child. If this is not normal behavior for her, you two need to have a calm conversation about why she felt the way she did. You say everything has been fine, but is it possible she\u2019s felt this way for a long time but didn\u2019t say anything to avoid a fight? (None of that would be on you - she is old enough to know how to properly express her feelings). Have a good long talk about why she feels the way she does (try not to get defensive, I know it can be hard - especially where you son is concerned) and talk it out. Unfortunately it may result that parenthood is just not something she wants to do.", "NAH \n\nIt's only been 2 months and you're all still adjusting to living together. \n\nTalk it over when you're both ready to be calm and no one's being accusatory. \n\nMaybe get a bigger bed? Make a little time together as a couple once a week without any interruptions? \n\nHopefully, it'll all come together. If she starts getting jealous over your son or still feels pushed out, then maybe couples therapy will help or maybe this relationship isn't working for the long term.", "I would run now. \n\nHuge red flag\n\nRun far far, far away, and don't look back", "Info:  Did she express how she would have rather been considered in the situation?  For instance would she want to have been asked and it's a privacy thing or was it that she felt left out?", "YTA\n\nI left a realtionship because they would never tell their kid no.

I understand the sentiment though, a child should never be denied cuddles. Also imo, major red flag for OP's partner...my husband and I have always either cuddled or slept with our backs facing each other. It's actually a sign of trust to leave your back exposed to someone.

If she has rejection issues with her blood family, she likely has never gotten that sort of closeness from a parent, so she doesn't understand why it's a big deal to you.\n\nTriggers suck. They can sometimes stick with you for a long time. If this is that, you really have to tread lightly. Just coax her into discussing it in more detail and DON'T dismiss it. You aren't in the dog house for cuddling your son. You're in the dog house for treating her feelings as unimportant.\n\nThis is where you just say, \"I'm so sorry for not being more sympathetic.

If snuggling in the mornings is something that is special between you two especially when you and her don\u2019t always get a lot of alone time, I can see her feeling hurt for you dropping her for him so nonchalantly.

Her leaving the bed is a bit dramatic (and the reason for the soft yta), but I don't think it is a red flag unless it continues to happen.\n\nNext time, maybe, instead of just spooning your child, you lay on your back and use one arm for your partner, too. It may help her feel included and more comfortable in the home.", "FYI - If you post there, let them know you're a bio-parent and then ask for advice to help your partner, they won't let you have an AITA style discussion, it's about helping your GF and you. \n\nAlso - dating someone with kids comes with a lot of inevitable rejection (ie your number one person puts you second), so it's definitely worth pursuing this to help her if she already has issues around this. \n\nAll the best!", "I think a frank conversation about her needs vs your son's, plus the needs of both adults in the relationship? Then negotiating ways to meet them that doesn't impact bonding moments with your son too much?

I fully understand my Bf's child comes first. I want to support his relationship with his son as well as grow my own with kiddo. However \n- I found the exuberance of his child exhausting at times and need space \n- I find some kid stuff a bit gross (the snot, mess and occasional poor toilet hygiene) \n- I miss our alone time (we now have dedicated date nights) \n\nWhile I don't mind the morning cuddles in our bed, many step-parents find it confronting, especially early on when they don't have a strong relationship themselves with the child.
