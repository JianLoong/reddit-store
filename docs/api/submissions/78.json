Fight with pet store owner\u2026", "selftext": "**Some background info:** \n\nI own an older horse who needs special feed in addition to hay to keep his weight up. This feed comes in 50lb bags and I order 15 a month which costs around $300. So that\u2019s 750lbs of feed bags.\n\nI order from a local livestock store. They require orders to be over $100 for delivery. Never had an issue before, however the business recently sold to an older man and his wife. Service has gone downhill. \n\nThey run the business lean. Deliveries used to be next day and now take a week plus.\n\n**What happened**\n\nWent in on a Monday and placed an order. Paid. My delivery was scheduled for the following Monday. \n\nMonday comes and I\u2019m waiting all day for the delivery\u2026 they close at 5 so a bit before 4 I called to ask if they\u2019ll still be delivering today. \n\nThe owner\u2019s wife asked for my name, checked and told me \u201cit\u2019s already been delivered.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it hasn\u2019t, I\u2019m here now and I\u2019ve been waiting all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you check everywhere?\u201d\n\nSo here I am looking for a small car size mound of feed bags to confirm it hasn\u2019t been delivered. I repeat it\u2019s not here. \n\n\u201cWell my driver says it\u2019s been delivered\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what to tell you.\u201d \n\nShe wasn\u2019t being helpful, so I decided to drive to the store and get it settled in person. By the time I arrived she had spoken to the driver again and he had delivered it to the wrong address. Not sure what address.\n\nThe owner was there as well so I was dealing with both of them.\n\nWe went back and forth and they were not willing to offer a solution.\n\nI\u2019m short and barely 100lbs, drive a small SUV. I asked him how he expects me to magically find this address and lift 750lbs of feed into my small car. He didn\u2019t have an answer, just shrugged.\n\nI asked if the driver can go back and bring it to my place. \u201cNo, the drivers all left for the day.\u201d\n\nI asked if someone can come tomorrow. \u201cNope all our delivery drivers are booked for the next week.\u201d\n\nI asked if I can have a refund. \u201cNope, it was delivered somewhere, I\u2019m out the product.\u201d\n\nAfter THIRTY minutes of this I was so frustrated I started tearing up. Only at the point of me crying did he offer come after closing and bring the feed himself. \n\nI said \u201cthank you, I appreciate it. I just want feed I paid for.\u201d\n\nAs I turned to leave he said sarcastically \u201csorry this is so emotional for you!!\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t respond.\n\nOwner showed up as promised and lugged all the bags himself. I asked if he found where the other bags were delivered and he said he didn\u2019t bother, he just brought new bags. \n\nOwner wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nAm I going crazy that this is awful customer service or AITA somehow?? \n\nThey were acting like I was out of line for expecting them to fix the issue and the owner acted like he was doing me a favor by coming after work?? I don\u2019t understand how they think I\u2019m the AH.

With an order of that size, you could\u2019ve taken him to small claims court!", "NTA interesting how the owner originally said they were out of the product, then magically gave you new bags. \ud83e\udd14 I wouldn\u2019t trust them since they already lied to you", "I'm at a loss to understand how this could have been in any way YOUR fault.
