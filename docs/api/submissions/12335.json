I'm sorry, never posted something like this before. \n\nTo be brief; my husband is going to Miami with a friend for a long weekend. I think this is great and supported the idea of this trip since the beginning. \n\nWe have a 17 year old daughter (his biological child, but I've been around since she was 5 years old. I love her to pieces.) He told me tonight that he informed our daughter 'Elisa ' that she could not leave the house nor stay overnight at any of her friends houses while he is on vacation. This was news to me as well (he mentioned this at dinner with all of us in the same room.)\n\nUnderstandably upset, Elisa asked why and what had she done  to be punished. My husband said she had done nothing, but she needed to be home the entire time because that was the only way he could trust that I would stay home as well. He said he didn't trust me not to \"stay out and party all weekend\" unless Elisa was home and I had to take care of her. My party days are long behind me but he brings them up constantly, many many years after the fact.\n\nAside from the logic being incredibly flawed here, I'm frankly disturbed by the fact he will punish her and jam up her extended weekend as a tool to ensure I do what he wants me to do. \n\nI told him flat out I thought what he did was unfair to Elisa and a little sick. He's now telling me it's my fault he had to resort to this because he can't trust me.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1678856994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rmt5b/aita_for_calling_put_husband_who_punishes_our/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he still doesn't trust you, the solution is a divorce - not to try and abusively control both you and your daughter. \n\nI'm going to guess that if you look back at your relationship after reading these comments, you're going to see a lot more incidents that you may have chalked up as something understandable at the time but now make you question his motives. \n\nYour daughter is almost a legal adult, so you don't have to worry about losing access to her WHEN you leave - and you absolutely should leave.

I know trust isn't easily regained - it can take time (I'm not sure how long it's been) but often it's a conscious choice; you have to draw a line somewhere otherwise the partnership is doomed.\n\nI'm also not a fan of punishing his kid or getting her involved in adult issues that don't have and shouldn't have anything to do with her. That's not good parenting, that's him using her to bodyguard his adult partner. \n\nThat's a point where trust issues can turn controlling and abusive - he can't use past behaviour to treat you like an out of control addict forever.", "Daughter is 17, you met her when she was 5. That's over a decade. Have you been clean for around that long too? If he doesn't trust you after all that time, he never will.

I don't have experience with this, but do you have a sobriety counsellor who can help you work through this with him? I'm not saying his behaviour is justified but it sounds like it has to be dealt with before you can move forward either way.", "Yep. I saw in your other comment that you\u2019re a recovering addict, but not at the beginning of that journey. At some point he has to let you show him that you are able to maintain your sobriety.
