My party days are long behind me but he brings them up constantly, many many years after the fact.\n\nAside from the logic being incredibly flawed here, I'm frankly disturbed by the fact he will punish her and jam up her extended weekend as a tool to ensure I do what he wants me to do. \n\nI told him flat out I thought what he did was unfair to Elisa and a little sick.

By all means, let him go off on his weekend- while he's gone, you need to meet with a divorce lawyer, photocopy all your paperwork, and arrange to live elsewhere, because this is coercive control, and depending on where you live, it is even illegal. It is considered a form of abuse.  \nHe is using your stepchild to control you, which isn't fair on either of you. If you have adopted your daughter, take her with you, and be gone before he gets back. If you haven't adopted her or have a legal right to her custody, see if there are some relatives who CAN take her, but don't leave her there to face his wrath. Make a police report before he comes back as well- paper trails are about to be a very important part of your life. Charge him with child abuse and endangerment, and note that he is attempting to use coercive control on the both of you.  \n\n\nIf you think this is extreme logic, I've been through it, and believe me, if you bow to his orders/ wishes now, it's only going to get worse- much much worse. It shows him that he has the upper hand and you'll do as you're told. He may even get a thrill out of it, which means he may want to get that thrill again, but doing the same won't give the same high, so it will be stranger, more controlling, more punitive. Don't just do this for yourself- do it for your lovely step-daughter. If she HAS to go back to him, make sure to have police do welfare checks on her, and call in CPS (which I know isn't ideal, but it is better than nothing) if you think she's in danger. You may even be able to get temporary custody of her until she's 18 if you play your cards right as he's roped her into this manipulative mess as well.\n\nHere is a helpful article if you haven't heard of this term before or are unsure what it is: https://www.healthline.com/health/coercive-control#getting-out\n\n  \n\"Coercive control is a pernicious form of domestic abuse that entraps you in a hostage-like situation. Regardless of the history with your abuser, even if it included some happy moments, you don\u2019t deserve this treatment.  \nGetting out of an abusive relationship can be complex, even more so when children are involved. But with a bit of planning, you can make a safe exit from the situation.  \nHere\u2019s what you can do:  \nMaintain communication with your support systems whenever possible. This is important regardless of your abuser\u2019s displeasure, says Patrick. You should also make sure family and friends have all of your contact information and check in on a regular basis.  \nCall a domestic violence hotline regularly. Keep track of where your nearest public phone is and periodically weigh your options with a professional. Our resource guide can provide you with more options.  \nPractice how to get out safely, and practice often. If you have kids, teach your kids to identify a safe place, such as a friend\u2019s house or the library, where they can go to for help and how to call the police.  \nHave a safety plan. \u201cWhen deciding to leave, victims should have a plan regarding where to go and who to stay with,\u201d Patrick adds, \u201crecognizing that the initial period of separation might be the most dangerous in terms of an abuser attempting to reconcile \u2014 through both legal and illegal conduct.\u201d\"  \n\n\nI wish you the best of luck, and all the strength you can muster. You are braver and stronger than you know, and most importantly NOT the asshole. Now go to the library or FedEx before he leaves, use their computer to look up what kind of paperwork your lawyer will need access to and find a lawyer you can give you a Saturday appointment. Do it with cash so there's no credit card trail he can trace. Use a payphone to call the lawyer, don't use your cellphone. Assume he's looking to catch you out, so assume the worst- cell phone records about who you're talking to, using cell phones as physical tracers or air tags in purses, cars, keystroke monitoring programs and family computer histories- assume he's going to use modern technology against you. If I'm wrong, no harm, no foul. If I'm right, then you've got the drop on him. Finally, as he's touching down from his jaunt in Miami, take out enough money to keep you going until he can be served with divorce papers, which will freeze your assets from both of you, because if he's doing this now, he most likely will try to use money to bring you back.  \n\n\nIf you're not ready to leave him yet, then at least keep a diary of his demands- whatever seems outrageous or over the top, write it down and put it somewhere safe, somewhere he can't reach. The human mind has a great capacity to forget trauma in order to protect ourselves, but you will need that list, if not for divorce, then at least for therapy, which if you stay, you're all going to need.
