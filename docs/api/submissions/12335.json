He said he didn't trust me not to \"stay out and party all weekend\" unless Elisa was home and I had to take care of her. My party days are long behind me but he brings them up constantly, many many years after the fact.\n\nAside from the logic being incredibly flawed here, I'm frankly disturbed by the fact he will punish her and jam up her extended weekend as a tool to ensure I do what he wants me to do. \n\nI told him flat out I thought what he did was unfair to Elisa and a little sick.
