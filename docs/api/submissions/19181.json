So very sorry for your loss, OP and also horrified that you are being abused at such an already overwhelming time. Please take the best care of yourself and surround yourself and your sweet boy with loving support. Block and go NC as needed with these maniacs who clearly have no respect\u2014or they wouldn\u2019t be tormenting the woman your husband loved. Enjoy your baby\u2019s newborn days and take everything else one step at a time. You got this <3", "NTA. Not their baby. Not their husband. Not their decision.", "NTA. \n1. You are the mother\n2. If any classmates of your son found out about the meaning of his name if you went with what your husband suggested they might bully him.", "NTA.\n\nYou *are* respecting your husband by loving his son for him and being the best parent you can be. The rest is just noise. A name is a name, it won't help bring back their lost son, it won't make the pain go away... You did the right thing for you and your child. \n\nBe more confident, stand your ground. You and your son take priority. Best of luck with it all. Be gentle on yourself.", "NTA. The baby grew inside of you and it would be an asshole move to name the kid \"Shit\" in any language IMO. If they didn't want to be \"embarrassed\" in front of other guests then they should have waited to bring it up in private if they weren't ready for an answer.", "NTA - finding names in a multilingual house is even more difficult than normal because names in one language don't necessarily work in another.\n\nYour in-laws are squabbling about \"being embarrassed\" because they have no leg to stand on concerning the name. They started yelling insisting on a stray thought their son had shortly before he died, it's they who should be embarrassed for their behavior. You did the right thing to defuse the situation by leaving. \n\nThey are hurt because of the loss of their son and you are too. If the relationship was fine until now, let everyone cool off and see if things can be normalized again.\n\nPS - sorry for your loss.", "NTA\nThey confronted you in front of other people, possibly expecting it to make you more submissive in the face of a crowd.

Good luck and sorry for your loss.", "Wait they want the poor kid called shit for the rest of his life ? \n\nNta", "NTA. First of all, that name would have been beautiful..for an afab/female identifying individual. Khara, Kara, Cora, Cara, they\u2019re all very similar and very feminine. Second of all, it\u2019s YOUR son, you talked with your husband and from your post, he seemed also taken aback by the meaning of the name. I\u2019m sure had he been here to help you with everything, you would not have settled with that name. \n\nThird and most important, hence why it gets its own paragraph, I\u2019m extremely sorry for your loss and hope you heal well, and hope you and your son have an amazing life. If you ever need a place to vent or just get your feelings out, my dms are open and judgement free.", "NTA. Not their kid, can\u2019t name em. Condolences, OP", "NTA.  THEY opted to have that conversation in front of a bunch of people, and your reasoning was clearly legit and made them look dumb. they didn\u2019t get the whole story from your husband it would seem. but he knew and had relented on that name according to you, right? that\u2019s way more important.", "NTA.\n\nIf they are going to ask a potentially awkward question in front of other people, they shouldn't make shocked Pikachu faces when you answer that question in front of other people.", "NTA, I\u2019m also half & would have not named him that either.

I also offer my congratulations for the birth of your son, who will no doubt know how much you and his dad love him. \n\nNTA First, it's none of their business what you name your baby, because he's your baby not theirs.  Second, it was one name suggested early on in picking names.  Given time, he very well could've lost his original excitement for the name.  Especially given the meaning. Third, they're the ones who brought it up in front of others. Even if they're overreacting because they're all struggling with the loss, it's no excuse for how they're treating you and your son. \n\nProceed with caution in your relationship with them. They're already involving themselves in something that's none of their business. Be ready to protect your son from their behavior if they keep acting in this manner.", "NTA. The rest of the family attacked you for \"embarrassing them\" because they also realize naming your child 'crap' in any language is a BAD move but they don't want your in laws mad at them. People will argue your tone when they can't successfully attack your point.\n\nYou were right to choose something that won't get him ridiculed, etc. for something as important as his name that he'll carry the rest of his life. \n\nYour in laws probably want to feel like they have some control and involvement, here, not realizing that they were never entitled to any control in the first place whether your husband was still here to Dad or not. You don't have to involve them, with something like names especially. Checking grandparents rights in your area would be a wise move since you're in one of the situations where some states say you're responsible for building a relationship between your child and your in laws. You just don't have to do anything with your son to make them happy; you're his mom, you're in charge. Trust yourself on that part. I'm so sorry for your loss and the struggle they're introducing in an already difficult situation. You don't need this crap.", "NTA But why would your husband want to call your son shit and don't speak with his parents ever again", "NTA. You had a rational reason to not use that name. And they asked, you answered. You did nothing wrong.", "I'm sorry, but when they said that your reasoning was bullshit... you could have responded with \"no, just normal shit.\"  I know it's very flippant, and petty... but totally appropriate.  Their prejudices were definitely showing, and you were totally right to name your child something else.  Who would want to think, every time they say their child's name, \"Why did I choose to name my child after excrement?\"  Feel free to cut them out of your life, unless they grow up  (and even then, you don't have to let them back into your life.)

Generally, names as a '2 yesses, 1 no' thing, where either of you can veto a name but it takes you both to pick one, so it would have been totally reasonable for you to have refused to agree to the name even if you husband had still wanted it after thinking it over and knowing the meaning.\n\nalso, it was wrong of your in laws to bring it up and criticize you in front of other people, especially as (if I understand right) you'd already told them in advance what his name was, so they could have asked you about it privately)\n\nSo, you weren't wrong to decide not to use that name, and they were wrong first in casuing a scene over it in front of others. You were rude in the comment you made.\n\nAll that said, I would suggest that you try to find a way to make peace with them.\n\nYou, and they, are all grieving, and grief, among other things, tend to make all of us more sensitive - when you are grieving, you are using so much of your energy and emotional bandwidth  trying to cope with your grief that you are likely to be less patient, less reasonable, less able to see other people's perspectives, more likely to feel that others are being unreasonable or deliberately unkind. All of this applies both to you, and to your husband's parents.\n\nYou can't change how they reacted and heirs was the first offence, but you can't control them, your can only choose how you behave.\n\nAnd - they are your child's grandparents, they are the people who raised your husband and helped him become the the person you fell in love with, and it sounds as though he was close to them and that you were in good terms with them before this, you chose to include them in you new baby's life etc.\n\nPerhaps consider reaching out (a letter or mail may be a good choice as you can think about how you word it, and even ask someone who is less close to the situation to review it) maybe set out that you love and are grieving their son, just as they are, that he is and will always be a big part of your son's life and of course your son will be told all about him as he grows, so his father is not forgotten. Explain t other that while their son had suggested the name, it was only one of a number of names the two of you were discussing, it wasn't something which you had agreed or decided on at the time of his dearth, and when he suggested it he wasn't aware that it had an unfortunate meaning in  Arabic. Explain that you and he had been talking about other names as well (if it is true, let them know that the name you ended up picking was one you'd discussed with him and that he knew about, even if the two of you hadn't reached a final decision yet when he died. If it wasn't a name that you discussed, explain why you chose the name you did (is it too late , if you haven't already, to give him his father's name as a middle name?)  .\n\nTell them that it's important to you that they are part of their grandson's life and that you believe that your husband would have wanted, most of all, for you and your son to be happy and for him to have a name that you felt wouldn't expose him to ridicule, and that  while their actions, and the fact that they were so critical of you in public and  suggested you were disrespecting your husband's memory, that you are willing to forgive them. That you accept that , like you, they are grieving and may have said more than they intended, and that you were also very upset because you felt that they were attacking you and your culture, and as a result, you also said more than you should have done. Tell them that you are sorry that they were embarrassed and that you are sure that they, too, are sorry that they upset and embarrassed you, and suggest that you all agree to move on.\n\nIdeally, that may allow you to build bridges and to ensure that your son gets to have a good relationship with his dad's side of the family.
