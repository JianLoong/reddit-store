So very sorry for your loss, OP and also horrified that you are being abused at such an already overwhelming time. Please take the best care of yourself and surround yourself and your sweet boy with loving support. Block and go NC as needed with these maniacs who clearly have no respect\u2014or they wouldn\u2019t be tormenting the woman your husband loved. Enjoy your baby\u2019s newborn days and take everything else one step at a time. You got this <3", "NTA. Not their baby. Not their husband. Not their decision.", "NTA. \n1. You are the mother\n2. If any classmates of your son found out about the meaning of his name if you went with what your husband suggested they might bully him.", "NTA.\n\nYou *are* respecting your husband by loving his son for him and being the best parent you can be. The rest is just noise. A name is a name, it won't help bring back their lost son, it won't make the pain go away... You did the right thing for you and your child. \n\nBe more confident, stand your ground. You and your son take priority. Best of luck with it all. Be gentle on yourself.", "NTA. The baby grew inside of you and it would be an asshole move to name the kid \"Shit\" in any language IMO. If they didn't want to be \"embarrassed\" in front of other guests then they should have waited to bring it up in private if they weren't ready for an answer.", "NTA - finding names in a multilingual house is even more difficult than normal because names in one language don't necessarily work in another.\n\nYour in-laws are squabbling about \"being embarrassed\" because they have no leg to stand on concerning the name. They started yelling insisting on a stray thought their son had shortly before he died, it's they who should be embarrassed for their behavior. You did the right thing to defuse the situation by leaving. \n\nThey are hurt because of the loss of their son and you are too. If the relationship was fine until now, let everyone cool off and see if things can be normalized again.\n\nPS - sorry for your loss.", "NTA\nThey confronted you in front of other people, possibly expecting it to make you more submissive in the face of a crowd.

You however are not required to excuse that.", "NTA.  I looked up the meaning and it\u2019s a girls name in most languages.   However it means donkey/ass in a few. \n\nhttps://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/khara\n\nYou and him never agreed to it before he passed.  It would have been different had you both agreed.

Good luck and sorry for your loss.", "Wait they want the poor kid called shit for the rest of his life ? \n\nNta", "NTA. First of all, that name would have been beautiful..for an afab/female identifying individual. Khara, Kara, Cora, Cara, they\u2019re all very similar and very feminine. Second of all, it\u2019s YOUR son, you talked with your husband and from your post, he seemed also taken aback by the meaning of the name. I\u2019m sure had he been here to help you with everything, you would not have settled with that name. \n\nThird and most important, hence why it gets its own paragraph, I\u2019m extremely sorry for your loss and hope you heal well, and hope you and your son have an amazing life. If you ever need a place to vent or just get your feelings out, my dms are open and judgement free.", "NTA. Not their kid, can\u2019t name em. Condolences, OP", "NTA.  THEY opted to have that conversation in front of a bunch of people, and your reasoning was clearly legit and made them look dumb. they didn\u2019t get the whole story from your husband it would seem. but he knew and had relented on that name according to you, right? that\u2019s way more important.", "NTA.\n\nIf they are going to ask a potentially awkward question in front of other people, they shouldn't make shocked Pikachu faces when you answer that question in front of other people.", "NTA, I\u2019m also half & would have not named him that either.

That's a lot to handle... you got this!", "NTA for not naming him a word that means poop and for standing up for yourself and leaving. If you actually screamed, then that's inappropriate.

You are, however, NTA for not naming your child poop. Your MIL and FIL are right \u2014 your excuse was, literally, bullshit.", "That is horrifying and I\u2019m so sorry you were treated like that.Even if they are grieving too. NTA\n\nMy sincerest condolences. You\u2019re so strong mama. Be strong for your baby, like you already are.", "I'm so sorry for the loss of your husband. I also offer my congratulations for the birth of your son, who will no doubt know how much you and his dad love him. \n\nNTA First, it's none of their business what you name your baby, because he's your baby not theirs.  Second, it was one name suggested early on in picking names.  Given time, he very well could've lost his original excitement for the name.  Especially given the meaning. Third, they're the ones who brought it up in front of others. Even if they're overreacting because they're all struggling with the loss, it's no excuse for how they're treating you and your son. \n\nProceed with caution in your relationship with them. They're already involving themselves in something that's none of their business. Be ready to protect your son from their behavior if they keep acting in this manner.", "NTA. The rest of the family attacked you for \"embarrassing them\" because they also realize naming your child 'crap' in any language is a BAD move but they don't want your in laws mad at them. People will argue your tone when they can't successfully attack your point.\n\nYou were right to choose something that won't get him ridiculed, etc. for something as important as his name that he'll carry the rest of his life. \n\nYour in laws probably want to feel like they have some control and involvement, here, not realizing that they were never entitled to any control in the first place whether your husband was still here to Dad or not. You don't have to involve them, with something like names especially. Checking grandparents rights in your area would be a wise move since you're in one of the situations where some states say you're responsible for building a relationship between your child and your in laws. You just don't have to do anything with your son to make them happy; you're his mom, you're in charge. Trust yourself on that part. I'm so sorry for your loss and the struggle they're introducing in an already difficult situation. You don't need this crap.", "NTA But why would your husband want to call your son shit and don't speak with his parents ever again", "NTA. You had a rational reason to not use that name. And they asked, you answered. You did nothing wrong.", "I'm sorry, but when they said that your reasoning was bullshit... you could have responded with \"no, just normal shit.\"  I know it's very flippant, and petty... but totally appropriate.  Their prejudices were definitely showing, and you were totally right to name your child something else.  Who would want to think, every time they say their child's name, \"Why did I choose to name my child after excrement?\"  Feel free to cut them out of your life, unless they grow up  (and even then, you don't have to let them back into your life.) NTA", "First of all, my condolences and I am very sorry for your loss. I hope wherever he is now he's happy.\n\n\nWell the name Hara (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac) means Happiness.\n\nSo perhaps your late husband thought that Hara was pronounced as Khara. (I suspect)\n(Tho the male version of Hara is Haris )\n\n\nYou said that you picked a beautiful name that your husband would be proud of. \n\nYou know your husband well. So you probably know his tastes, his likes, etc So if it's a name that he would definitely like and it truly honours his memory then all is well.\n\n\nI say NTA in that case.\n\n\n\nAlthough, that comment \"Your American is showing\" and embarrassing them in front of people seems kinda assholish.\n\nRemember, you lost a husband. They lost their child. So perhaps they clinged on his last wish to keep his memory closer. (I have seen it several times happening). Imagine if your own child died. You'd cling to his last wish right?\n\n\nYou should have an honest and good conversation about it with them. And apologize for the rude comment.\n\nNeedless to say, they were TA for their behaviour and for yelling, but it can also be due to the grief.", "INFO: I\u2019m curious to know the timeline. How did it take so long for the in-laws to find out the name? I assume they would\u2019ve have been in touch with you around the time of the birth via phone or text. Didn\u2019t you send them a picture with here\u2019s baby X? \n\nSeems a little odd that they didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care until the in person meeting.", "NTA.", "Well you didnt follow the last wish of your dead husband , how could you not be TA ?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
