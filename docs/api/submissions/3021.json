George lives in San Francisco, which is about a 13 hour trip by car, 2 by plane. He\u2019ll come to visit several times a year, both to see us but also because he owns an apartment building here. When George visits, he\u2019ll usually stays with me, and I\u2019ll loan him my car and cook for him (he prefers homemade food). Everyone loves George, but he\u2019s been complaining about having to take these trips rather than the family coming out to see him.\n\nEnter Thanksgiving. He invites my sister and I to come down to SFO, and since neither of us like to fly over the holidays, my sister offered to drive the two of us. How perfect! She has a large hatch-back, which means my dog can fit comfortably in the back. My dog is called \u201cRobert\u201d, and he\u2019s absolutely the sweetest \u2013 loves nothing more than to cuddle, get petted, sleep on my foot, low drama. The thing about Robert though is he\u2019s a rescue. In his previous life, he wasn\u2019t treated very well, so he gets SEVERE separation-anxiety when I leave him alone. He\u2019ll search all over the house looking for me, give up, then start over a few minutes later. He won\u2019t eat. He\u2019ll literally go on a hunger strike. One time, my nephew gave Robert McDonalds chicken nuggets because he had barely eaten a thing in 3 days. \n\nThe last time I hired a dog-sitter for Robert, she had excellent reviews online, but completely bailed on him the first day and LEFT HIM OUTSIDE the entire time. My neighbors called and I had to end my trip early. \n\nGeorge knows all of this, so I wasn\u2019t expecting resistance at the idea of bringing Robert with us. He said he\u2019d think about it, then called two days later and said no way. He was concerned about Robert\u2019s \u201cbehavior problems\u201d (wha?!), and said he was concerned about his floors. \u201cGeorge, you had a dog for 10 years until just recently, and the only \u2018behavioral problems\u2019 Robert has is he freaks out when I leave town without him\u201d. I had Robert\u2019s nails sanded so he wouldn\u2019t scuff up the floors. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t budge. So, I said I\u2019m not coming then. We\u2019re a package deal. \n\nThis caused a bit of a hoopla, and I got an email a few days later accusing ME of having \u201cbehavioral problems\u201d (I\u2019m a grown-ass professional woman). AITA for cancelling??\n\nP.S. George booked a flight to spend Thanksgiving in Florida and didn\u2019t even bother telling my sister, who was coming with me, that Thanksgiving was cancelled.

You don't have to go if you don't want to leave your dog, and George has a right not to have animals in his home if he doesn't want them. (He invited you, not you and the dog).\n\nSounds like it came to the best conclusion that it could have. He certainly could have told your sister that he wasn't hosting for the holiday, though. That makes him a bit of an AH, I guess.", "Info: what work are you doing to help the dog with these issues? Because if your response is \"nothing I just bring him everywhere with me no matter what\".... you're the one with issues. That's not healthy for the dog.", "Nah, I don\u2019t think either of you would be the asshole for not wanting to compromise on the subject of your dog. You aren\u2019t entitled to bringing a dog to someone else\u2019s house. Even if he had a dog, it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s his house and he\u2019s either comfortable or he isn\u2019t. At the same time, I know as a sitter myself (I do Rover some weekends and holidays as a side thing) that there are just some dogs that can\u2019t really be left. I am currently watching a dog that literally can\u2019t be left alone to go to the store. I\u2019m sorry you had a terrible experience with your previous sitter, I hope you have better luck next time. Try to find a good one and then keep using that person forever lol. Your dog will get comfortable with that person and have less anxiety with them. You can do meet and greets so you hang out with the sitter and your dog and make sure it\u2019s a good fit, and then if you want you can plan a few \u201cpractice runs\u201d where they just sit for a few hours or overnight to get to know each other before any long stays.", "the only assholish thing here is the communication issue and people getting up in their feelings\n\nsome people are not pet-friendly people. i'm going to go out on a limb and assume he was respectful of your household and wasn't mean to your dog when he visited you, and this is proper. but it's obvious he doesn't like dogs and doesn't want one in his house, and that's also his right.\n\ni would be real dollars that when he told you \"i'll think about it\" he already knew he wouldn't allow the dog in his house, he just didn't know how to tell you in a manner that woudln't make him look like an asshole. and then he stewed about it, and worked himself up into being condescending trying to make excuses like the dog's behavior and other stuff. most people really don't want to feel like an a-hole and try to avoid that kind of confrontation. a lot of people just don't know how to be assertive without being aggressive, so they overshoot when they stand up for themselves. him booking a trip to florida immediately after is just him evacuating the immediate environment to escape the blowout. he might be afraid you guys would come anyway and bring the dog, forcing him into an even more direct confrontation. he can't be dragged into that kind of situation if he's not physically present in the first place, so he went somewhere else.\n\nwhen everyone is calmer and has settled down and stopped the shit-flinging, have a talk with him and see if yall can compromise. there are pet friendly hotels and the climate is usually nice in and around SF. maybe instead of staying at your brother's place you could schedule a trip once or twice a year to go down there and hang out and let him show you and robert around or go on hikes or visit the beach or go camping or something, and that way he doesn't have to worry about having a dog in his house the whole time?", "I think a light ESH. Some people don\u2019t want dogs in their home and dog people have a way of imposing them anyway for XYZ reason and not respecting that boundary. Dog people often oversell how well behaved their dog is too so if George is saying your dog has behavioral problems, my hunch is that is probably true. You shouldn\u2019t expect others to agree to have your dog stay in their home. I don\u2019t blame George for sticking to his guns on that. And I don\u2019t blame you for deciding not to go because it doesn\u2019t work for you and your pet. \n\nBut I also think George is also an AH for not telling your sister he cancelled Thanksgiving. And to the bigger issue here: with almost all the family living in one place, it is obviously much easier for many logistical reasons (including pets) for George to come to you. It\u2019s unreasonable he expect you all to travel to him. So he is the overall AH for that reason but not for declining the dog as a guest.", "NTA \n\n1. George gets to call the shots in his home. If that means no visiting pets, that's the rule.\n2. You are perfectly within your rights to decline to come then. \n3.

An invitation is not an order. \n\nYour brother had the right to be upset you decided not to come,  but not to be hostile about it.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t want to come on his terms and declined the invite. That is perfectly fair. \n\nBut your brother isn\u2019t an AH for not wanting the dog. I also don\u2019t think he\u2019s an AH for being surprised you\u2019re not going. I\u2019d hate to say it but a pet isn\u2019t a child. You totally don\u2019t have to go but I\u2019m sure Robert would figure out how to be without you.", "NTA, your brother was an asshole for even saying that you should come, when he had no actual intention of hosting you and your pet.

Your dog stayed at your house. No one ever asked let alone expected other people to put up with your dog in their home. \n\nIs there a recent epidemic of dogs developing separation anxiety?", "Although, his cancelling Thanksgiving was rude, overall YTA.  Yeah u don't have to accept an invite, but honestly from what u wrote it sounds like George might be feeling like u guys don't like him. You said he was upset he was the only one making the effort to visit and then when u guys finally agreed you kinda told him ur dog was more important than him.  \n\nYou have valid reasons for wanting to take ur dog, but in the end I think  he hears that u love the dog more than him. If that's what he is hearing, and yea it's a bit of a childish feeling, it cld be one of the reasons he had a childish response by cancelling.  \n\nAlso, if your sister got involved and tried to get George to let you bring the dog, he might have felt even more disrespected and ganged up on, which is also why he reacted rudely.", "people with pets are just like people with kids. they always think that the entire world has to be completely welcoming and open to them. \u201cbut he\u2019s a rescue\u201d \u201cbut he just likes to cuddle\u201d \u201cbut he\u2019s the sweetest\u201d \n\nyour brother has every right to decline having your dog in his home, and you have every right to not attend if you don\u2019t want to leave your dog.

Not the dogs\u2019 fault. It\u2019s instinctual. But owners need to listen and be more respectful. Once a cousin who we invited to stay when he was passing through town brought his dog, and didn\u2019t tell us he had her with him until he showed up.

She damaged our door in the room where we had to isolate her, barked at the cats all night, peed and pooped on the floor because she got excited, etc. I swore never again.", "There are multiple reasons why someone may not want a dog around after having one themselves:\n\n- it reminds them too much of their late dog (this is why my stepmother had to stop her doggy daycare after losing two dogs).\n- now not having a dog, they\u2019ve realised how much of a mess dogs make.\n- their dog was better behaved.\n- they\u2019ve just moved or had their house redecorated now there\u2019s not a dog about (OP does mention their brother\u2019s worried about his floors).", "Sure but his dog may have been better behaved. He said that he didn\u2019t want OP\u2019s dog there because her dog has behavioral problems.

I was pushed to YTA for two reasons.  The first was her edit. It had a tone, and I admit this is a gut feeling, of \"pettiness\", for lack of a better word, that comes out when people are arguing with their siblings.  Alot if times we can forget our adult words and problem solving and revert to being childish and the edit made me think that's what happened when she was declining the invite. That cld be wrong it's a gut feeling, but everyone writing this is biased so I  kinda gotta think what the other side is (through my admittedly biased lens) and I can very much imagine the tit for tat between siblings in a situation like this!\n\nThe other, more important reason, I went with YTA is that the OP never said she has done behavioral training for her dog.  When a dog has issues like that it is bad for the dog, the owner and others if it is not dealt with properly.  I say this bc I knew someone who owned a dog with separation anxiety and wld only be calm around this person.  I told them the dog needed help or it cld get bad, the owner ignored me and the dog ended up getting very agitated, it killed someone else's cat and had to be put down.  So I feel like unless the OP has truly done everything to help her dog over these issues she is not a dog owner who is taking the health and well being of her animal into account.  If this is the case I view her as an irresponsible dog owner.  Which if she is, then she is kinda just putting a bandaid over the bullet wound and then asking others to just accept the consequences.\n\nI cld be wrong about all of that but again I can only go off of the post and give my opinion!", "she feels entitled to bring her dog to his house. she said it directly in the post. that her dog isn\u2019t a problem and has separation anxiety so george shouldn\u2019t have a problem with it. and when george declined OP went on about how george used to have a dog of his own so he shouldn\u2019t say no. \n\nand no, it\u2019s not okay that the brother ditched the other sister, but that\u2019s not what this post is about and shouldn\u2019t have bearing on my judgment.

Especially if they stress out resident pets. \n\nMy mutt is literally the only one I know that actually learned something from a cat smacking his nose.

She just does not care about them in the slightest. Even strays that jump our fence, she just looks and lays back down.\n\nWe got chickens months back, and she broke their coop just so she could herd them. No harm to them.

I would have asked your brother first if it would be ok to bring Robert and then based on his answer I\u2019d have made my decision. However, I wouldn\u2019t think of leaving my dog at home if he had separation issues. Maybe you could have rented a hotel room or Airbnb that accepts pets?

Lol", "NAH", "This is the best answer and deserves an award IMO.", "He saw the dog as an issue in his house, his house his rules, OP is not entitled to force her dog on everyone everywhere she goes, especially since she did say the dog suffers from separation anxiety and if OP is not getting the dog help it needs then she is a HUGE AH.", "Dude are you okay? Drunk? You really need to talk to your daughter about her dog instead of commenting all over this post about it. Like the brother totally has a right to not want the dog in his house but you seem personally offended by OP and her attachment to her dog.", "Plus, I get the idea that she isn't getting her dog help for his issues, which in turn makes her a bigger AH because it isn't healthy for the dog to be going through separation anxiety.", "The pet has separation anxiety and most certainly has behavior issues, so many dog owners like to oversell that their dog is an angel with wings.", "They also have the tendency to overlook or downplay their dog\u2019s behavior.", "Yea my dog is an asshole.

On holidays if it\u2019s hosted at my grandmas , my dad or my aunt a or b my dog is welcome. No one says a word and everyone loves him. If it\u2019s hosted at my aunts c or d , my dog stays and my dad is next to me most of the night in case I have any issues. I will go for an hour or 2 then leave.  My aunts are allergic and dog fur stays after you leave. If it\u2019s a nice day they will call and say we set up tents outside so bring Balto. They try to accommodate because they like him and it\u2019s easy to take medicine but it\u2019s hard when a dog is all over your home. I don\u2019t want them to suffer after everyone leaves. I respect that. All my friends know I travel with my pup, I get a separate hotel when visiting. Those that volunteer for us to stay instead, I always say yes if I feel it\u2019s genuine Not all people want a dog in their home. My dog is highly trained and has travelled more then the average person, I still try to be considerate.\n\n\nAs for your brother, I would feel a type a way because you do a lot for him when he visits. When he visits he will need to rent a car and cook his own food. If he can\u2019t accommodate you, then you can\u2019t help him. It\u2019s a 2 way street. It sounds like you do a lot for him to be comfortable. My siblings know I\u2019m showing up with the dog, they even have a bed for him at their places.", "Esh. You\u2019re both NTA. His house his rules. Your dog your rules.", "NTA. You look after your dog.
