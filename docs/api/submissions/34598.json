We went to the same school together, my friends were her friend's younger siblings. Before Covid-19 happened we hadn't seen each other for at least two years and covid happened so it's been five years since we all saw each other. A lot has changed, many of us have graduated and have full-time jobs, many have gone on to start a PhD and so on. \n\nMy sister works at a high school as an English teacher whereas I work at a university as a university research lecturer. My sister spends 80% of her working hours teaching, the other 20% of the time is spent marking and doing admin. During dinner, a friend of hers asked me what I was up to now; before I got the chance to answer, my sister butted in, saying she's got the same job as me; she teaches. At this point, I said no, we don't have the same job. I corrected the fact she works as a teacher at a secondary school. I work at a university, and I only spend ten hours a week teaching; the rest is spent researching my field of work, coming up with new project proposals, publishing and much more. \n\nI do admit that I have an attitude problem but I don't know why. Most of the time anything I say comes out in a rude tone even though I don't mean to. I immediately apologised for giving a rude attitude as it genuinely wasn't meant to happen. However, I didn't apologise for correcting my sister. We had dinner and went home, I noticed my sister was in a mood whilst dropping her off back to her place. \n\nThis morning I woke up to a message from my sister, which was a paragraph calling me an asshole for looking down upon her job and being downright rude. I sent a message back saying \"I knew my attitude came off rude, but I apologised for it straight away when I noticed. I said I don't look down upon you because you're a teacher. I won't apologise for correcting you and saying our jobs are different. You are a teacher, and most of your hours are spent teaching; the rest is spent marking and doing admin tasks. Mine is spent teaching, marking, doing admin, creating research proposals, helping in projects, publishing and much more.\" \n\nShe is still mad at me.

You do the same type of work she does, but only for a small amount of time, while the other time is spent on other things.  So there is a big difference there.\n\nIt's like comparing a chef to a homemaker.  A homemaker does some cooking, but other things as well.  Both are important jobs, but in different ways.", "ESH.

People like you give PhDs/professors the bad name. Generally, a teacher and lecturer are pretty much the same thing, it is just that one of them is at college level. Also, a teacher will have more job security compared to a lecturer. If you had a TT job, that still does not mean, you should demean the job your sister is doing. Teaching HS is loads harder than being a lecturer.", "YTA - you said yourself you were rude, so yeah its an AH thing to be rude. Your jobs also are pretty similar. Youre both teachers.

You assume (incorrectly, might I add) that you do more work, or your work is inherently more difficult.\n\nHow do I know that you're incorrect? As an adult, you're teaching adults who want to be there, in an adult environment and an expectation of a certain adult behaviour.   \nWhen you're not teaching you're talking, to and working, with adults who've proven their worth to be there. They've invested time, money, or passion into a specific field just to be inhabiting the same space as you.\n\nYour sister is in the position of not only teaching young, hormonal ferals how to do their ABCs, but how to be decent, kind and caring *adults that will later be in your space*.   \nYou are taking an art piece, dusting it, wiping a cloth over the parts that won't dust easily, putting it in the right space and lighting it in just the right way to show each and every individual nook and cranny that the artist created. To present it in just the right way that people can look at it and really learn or understand something that they previously had never considered.\n\nShe's the one that helped make the painting in the first place. \n\nI've taught in an adult environment. I'd take 100 licks of the whip before I tried to teach a class of teenagers. Teachers are no joke.", "YTA. I believe you could have handled the situation much better.

Whether or not you meant it, you were rude and there was no need for it. This puts you in the wrong as well.

Your attitude sucks and you belittled her publicly.

Your sister is wrong, but most people who haven't been in the academic side are, and only conceive university teachers instead of researchers with some teaching duties because that's what they see.\n\nMoreover, you do look down on her job. Badly. And your way of comparing is no less wrong. Your \"teaching\" work not only requires much less time than hers, it also takes significantly less effort because you're teaching (technically) adults instead of teenagers. You're not even expected to know anything about teaching itself, much less developmental psychology, or dealing with your students' conflicts, or their behavior, or their families, or _so much more_.\n\nYour teaching and her teaching are not the same.

I am sure people did not really want to know the minute details... I would imagine your sister was proud of you both in becoming teachers", "NTA but only because you apologized. Your apology in front of the friend group could have been improved by emphasizing that your sister\u2019s job is mostly directly teaching students, instead of just saying \u2018she teaches secondary school\u2019 and letting other people fill in the blanks from their own experiences. Because, saying \u201cshe teaches high school, I teach university\u201d very much comes across as elitist, like you consider your job to be superior.", "Yta", "ESH.\n\nYou were rude and so was she.

Your sister moreso.\n\nIf she doesn't want to be corrected tell her not to speak for other people.\n\nYou obviously have different jobs. It's like comparing a pediatrician to a neurosurgeon.\n\nYeah, you're both doctors but one is more advanced. \n\nObviously you're aware enough to know you had a shitty attitude. There's definitely a better tone and choice of language to correct someone in that situation which can explain the differences and not hurt your sisters pride.", "Nta\n\nYou were rude, but apologised for that right away\n\nAs for pointing out you dont have the same job, thats just a simple fact.\n\nIf your sister feels insecure because you work at a university, thats her problem not yours.\n\nP.S. she shouldn't feel bad for being a HS teacher - Its a vocational job thats far more difficult than it pays. Teachers are incredibly important to society", "You are not in the wrong. I teach CTE Automotive Technology at a HS and a CC.  I have to teach, run a shop, equip it, stock it, keep everyone safe, and allow 180+ people to work in environments that will kill them if they aren't careful.  Far cry from a History class or drawing studio.  Different is different.", "YTA.  You\u2019re actually right, your sister\u2019s job is significantly more challenging, demanding, and difficult than yours is, and she shouldn\u2019t be selling herself short by comparing herself to you.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re clearly aware of this, and felt the need to backhandedly insult her is what makes you the asshole here.", "Easy ESH.

It's hard to tell though because I have a much different relationship with my brother, we often make fun of each other but that's not to say that I don't love him. If he was a teacher and it wasn't such a sore spot for him I'd probably make a bit of fun of him.", "Nta, question was posed to you.  Your sister butted in and answered on your behalf.

They are completely different with unique challenges and require different strengths.", "ESH", "YTA - you admit yourself that you were rude and know you have an attitude. Maybe instead of acting like it's some unchangeable personality trait, you learn to communicate.\n\nMaybe your sister doesn't know the ins and outs lf your job and hence thought they were similar.

So yeah, two different jobs. It's probably just that she hasn't realised how little teaching you do, and you are definitely missing that teaching has a lot more admin and prep than you've taken account of.\n\nFor any other pair this would have gone \"She does what I do, teaching\", \"I do teach, but I mainly research and do projects\" and that would have been that. Seems like both of you have a bit of an ego and a chip on your respective shoulders is all. Points for recognising your tone was rude though.", "YTA - It sounds like you're basically an adjunct, which makes it even funnier. You probably make less money, work more hours and have way less job security than your sister.", "YTA.\n\nYour comments are ridiculously easy to read as saying \"You do two things, while I do ten different things.\"  They read as though you're saying her job is easier than yours.\n\nI'll admit bias here- I'm a public school English teacher- but public school teachers in general get a lot of shit thrown at us that tends to put us on the defensive sometimes.  And your comments, while perhaps not intended that way, are ridiculously easy to read as thinking that her work is easier than yours.", "YATA, not only because you think your job is superior to your sisters, but mainly because you are aware of beeing rude in other occassions as well, and did not bother to change this until now. (TIP: It would be so easy not to be rude by just THINKING before opening your mouth) People with low self esteem tend to wanna stay out from the mob, so please ask yourself why.", "YTA.

Maybe she shouldn't have interrupted when you were being asked, not her, but you were clearly looking down on her as a teacher and were rude.

Both fields specialize in the dissemination of knowledge. They\u2019re both valuable, despite the fact that the work load of a high school teacher tends to be higher.\n\nThere really was no reason to make this an argument, and it makes me suspect that there is much more going on here. \n\nYou\u2019ve partially apologized; now apologize for the rest. Unless your relationship is less valuable to you than making this pretty irrelevant point.", "YTA. Yes these are different jobs and yes its totally fine to correct your sister.

Maybe you could have been more circumspect, but she interrupted you probably so you wouldn\u2019t be able to outshine her in some way.", "NTA - I think it\u2019s important that you immediately apologized for the attitude. However, as someone who has worked as a secondary school teacher and is currently working as a research assistant with only 2 lectures per week, the jobs really aren\u2019t much alike.

Did you want revenge? \n\nI\u2019m not saying anything is wrong with you\u2014just suggesting that identifying the thought process or emotional process behind that moment may help to clarify how those moments keep happening in your life, if you do want to take more control over them.", "As a college lecturer, I believe teaching secondary kids is 10000x times harder \ud83d\ude16", "Yeah to me based on her description and post, what is \u201crather clear\u201d is that she wants people to know she\u2019s got a more important job than a high school English teacher because she\u2019s at a university and does the same things but also makes project proposals and stuff.", ">Answering a question that wasn\u2019t directed to you is rude\n\nYou took 1 part out of my response to react to, this was the full reaction:\n\n> answering a question **wrong** which was directed at someone else at that, **because you're insecure about your own job**\n\nthere, bolded out the parts you conveniently skipped. You did the same with your previous response, where you said\n\n> you think calling someone a teacher is tearing them down\n\nwhich again is only part of the actual comment which was:\n\n>**Those jobs are wildly different**. She said they\u2019re the same because **she\u2019s insecure** so she tried to tear you down. **The attitude problem is with her**, not you. I\u2019d have an attitude too if **someone didn\u2019t allow me to say what I do for a living** and just **answered** for me **incorrectly**\n\nAgain, you conveniently twisted what was being said to fit your own narrative. You keep insisting you're right, because you are unable to look at the complete picture. When you need to pick something appart and only take one aspect out of the entire thing to drive your point, you're point is wrong.", "I have taught college and am now teaching high school. Teaching college was so much easier!!!! I admire those who have taught elementary or high school for years because it is such a hard job to do! \n\nIf anything, OP should be looking up to her sister, not the other way around!", "I have been a substitute at primary school, high school and college, and I wouldn't go back to high school, not even if you pay me a million dollars. It was a nightmare, I salute those who are brave enough to do it.", "It must be.  College classes don't tolerate nearly as much fucking around, because you're wasting other students money, so they other students tend to police the class.  HS is far more challenging to keep an orderly classroom, and students frequently undermine that goal.", "I didn\u2019t twist anything.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to change the meaning of \u201ctear someone down\u201d to suit your own nonsense. I don\u2019t have to \u201cinsist\u201d I am right, I simply AM right. And the fact that you have to try to misuse and distort the meaning of a phrase proves it.\n\nHave the day you deserve!", "Yeah I'm not a child, I'm not gonna play \"yes you did, no I didn't\" with you, so not gonna read what you comment, I didn't distort a thing, that was all you, and thanks for wishing me an amazing day.", "Downvotes don\u2019t bother me at all, they don\u2019t do anything and I\u2019m just bored at work on a slow day entertaining myself\n\nWhy else would I be egging on all these arguments lol", "esh. you definitely took it up a notch, but at the same time, it seems that your sister answered for you to \"equalize\"  your jobs in front if friends because she didn't want you to look better than her in front of these people.", "Idk.. but \u201cshe teaches!\u201d Is a hell of a lot more straightforward and to the point for a simple introduction than \u201cshe teaches, marks, admins, creates important stuff and publishes cause she\u2019s a research lecturer for ..blank university.\u201d If that\u2019s how you introduce yourself, you may want to just..keep it short.", "Honestly, this is one of my biggest pet peeves with some people. You admitted you have an attitude problem, work on it. Apologizing for being rude doesn\u2019t make it okay or prohibit people from being upset about it. \n\nYou are both teachers. YTA.", "The sister shouldn't have butted in. OP was asked, not her. OP can speak for themselves.", "It sounds like you are more of a research specialist. Maybe that\u2019s what you should refer to your job as going forward but I can see how your comment would maybe have a little bit of a thing to it but she has  to understand your  two jobs are different!  I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong there for making that correction\u2026 maybe a simple \u201cwell I do more researching than teaching actually so our roles are a bit different\u201d \u2026", "YTA you should research \u201chow to think before I speak\u201d", "NAH but if you were a cool sibling you would have added something like 'her job is way harder than mine, she teaches teenagers full time whereas I get to do research in a quiet room for most of my week.'\n\nThe way you phrased it absolutely came off as sounding like you think your job is better or more important instead of different. You might have been 'correct' in what you said but that doesn't make it right.\n\nI can see why she's still mad at you because your follow up response was more about your 'correctness' than it was about feeling bad you hurt her feelings.", "So.. you look down on you sister for being a high school teacher, when in fact her job is MUCH harder than yours... Yikes.\n\nMaybe leave academia and see how the real world functions. YTA", "NTA - What level of education did you both achieve?", "NTA. Sister should not have answered for OP.", "YTA for how you responded. My sister and I have completely different jobs. She is a high school teacher, I work in an office setting. While I have my own job I guess sometimes I teach things to people since I've been there a lot longer than everyone. If she said we did the same thing and we teach, I wouldn't even correct her that harshly. I would just explain that \"yeah I guess I do a little of that but she's a way better teacher\" and then go on saying what I do more of. \n\nYour response was unnecessary, even if technically correct.", "Lol, academia.", "What university research do English professors do?", "NTA. I understand this frustration. The thing is the mass number of people do not understand what academia is like. The qualifications are different and the day to day life is also drastically different. I don't think it has to do with looking down on anyone. I would never want to work in a secondary school because that comes with its own challenges. But it is frustrating to have your work minimized to only part of what you do. Especially if this is a repeated problem, it may be worth asking your sister why she describes it that way. Sometimes, it may be that it's easier to explain to others (I know when I try to explain what my job duties are to others they typically only latch onto a few things I say). But maybe it's more. And I think it's fine that you worked very hard to get to your position that is a very competitive position and not want it to seem like it is something it isn't.", "OP sounds like an arrogant jerk.", "Sounds like both of you don\u2019t respect one another or their jobs. I also can\u2019t help but getting Ross Geller vibes from your stance xD", "Honestly, having done both, Id take teaching kids over a careers of academic research 10 out of 10 times and I *love* research. Both fields are under paid, thankless, and have fucking brutal levels of politics. The tradeoffs are just a bit different, not one is better than the other.", "I was thinking the same thing. Shouldn't it be cool to have something in common with your sister? Of course, I *like* my sister. Not sure about the dynamics here.", ">You are a teacher, and most of your hours are spent teaching; the rest is spent marking and doing admin tasks. Mine is spent teaching, marking, doing admin, creating research proposals, helping in projects, publishing and much more.\n\nThe \u201ccreating research proposals, helping in projects, publish and much more\u201d comes off as condescending, implying that their job is more demanding and more important than that of a high school teacher", "I have taught both hs and college. Trust me. Teaching high school is a lot harder. Also, most high school teachers make more money than adjunct professors.", "I\u2019ve been teaching high school for 6 years now and have figured out a good rhythm, I don\u2019t really deal with any extreme behavior issues beyond too much chatting, phones, and kids not wanting to to do anything.
