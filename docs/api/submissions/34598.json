We went to the same school together, my friends were her friend's younger siblings. Before Covid-19 happened we hadn't seen each other for at least two years and covid happened so it's been five years since we all saw each other. A lot has changed, many of us have graduated and have full-time jobs, many have gone on to start a PhD and so on. \n\nMy sister works at a high school as an English teacher whereas I work at a university as a university research lecturer. My sister spends 80% of her working hours teaching, the other 20% of the time is spent marking and doing admin. During dinner, a friend of hers asked me what I was up to now; before I got the chance to answer, my sister butted in, saying she's got the same job as me; she teaches. At this point, I said no, we don't have the same job. I corrected the fact she works as a teacher at a secondary school. I work at a university, and I only spend ten hours a week teaching; the rest is spent researching my field of work, coming up with new project proposals, publishing and much more. \n\nI do admit that I have an attitude problem but I don't know why. Most of the time anything I say comes out in a rude tone even though I don't mean to. I immediately apologised for giving a rude attitude as it genuinely wasn't meant to happen. However, I didn't apologise for correcting my sister. We had dinner and went home, I noticed my sister was in a mood whilst dropping her off back to her place. \n\nThis morning I woke up to a message from my sister, which was a paragraph calling me an asshole for looking down upon her job and being downright rude. I sent a message back saying \"I knew my attitude came off rude, but I apologised for it straight away when I noticed. I said I don't look down upon you because you're a teacher. I won't apologise for correcting you and saying our jobs are different. You are a teacher, and most of your hours are spent teaching; the rest is spent marking and doing admin tasks. Mine is spent teaching, marking, doing admin, creating research proposals, helping in projects, publishing and much more.\" \n\nShe is still mad at me.

You do the same type of work she does, but only for a small amount of time, while the other time is spent on other things.  So there is a big difference there.\n\nIt's like comparing a chef to a homemaker.  A homemaker does some cooking, but other things as well.  Both are important jobs, but in different ways.", "ESH.

People like you give PhDs/professors the bad name. Generally, a teacher and lecturer are pretty much the same thing, it is just that one of them is at college level. Also, a teacher will have more job security compared to a lecturer. If you had a TT job, that still does not mean, you should demean the job your sister is doing. Teaching HS is loads harder than being a lecturer.", "YTA - you said yourself you were rude, so yeah its an AH thing to be rude. Your jobs also are pretty similar. Youre both teachers.

You assume (incorrectly, might I add) that you do more work, or your work is inherently more difficult.\n\nHow do I know that you're incorrect? As an adult, you're teaching adults who want to be there, in an adult environment and an expectation of a certain adult behaviour.   \nWhen you're not teaching you're talking, to and working, with adults who've proven their worth to be there. They've invested time, money, or passion into a specific field just to be inhabiting the same space as you.\n\nYour sister is in the position of not only teaching young, hormonal ferals how to do their ABCs, but how to be decent, kind and caring *adults that will later be in your space*.   \nYou are taking an art piece, dusting it, wiping a cloth over the parts that won't dust easily, putting it in the right space and lighting it in just the right way to show each and every individual nook and cranny that the artist created. To present it in just the right way that people can look at it and really learn or understand something that they previously had never considered.\n\nShe's the one that helped make the painting in the first place. \n\nI've taught in an adult environment. I'd take 100 licks of the whip before I tried to teach a class of teenagers. Teachers are no joke.", "YTA. I believe you could have handled the situation much better.

Whether or not you meant it, you were rude and there was no need for it. This puts you in the wrong as well.

Your attitude sucks and you belittled her publicly.

Your sister is wrong, but most people who haven't been in the academic side are, and only conceive university teachers instead of researchers with some teaching duties because that's what they see.\n\nMoreover, you do look down on her job. Badly. And your way of comparing is no less wrong. Your \"teaching\" work not only requires much less time than hers, it also takes significantly less effort because you're teaching (technically) adults instead of teenagers. You're not even expected to know anything about teaching itself, much less developmental psychology, or dealing with your students' conflicts, or their behavior, or their families, or _so much more_.\n\nYour teaching and her teaching are not the same.

I am sure people did not really want to know the minute details... I would imagine your sister was proud of you both in becoming teachers", "NTA but only because you apologized. Your apology in front of the friend group could have been improved by emphasizing that your sister\u2019s job is mostly directly teaching students, instead of just saying \u2018she teaches secondary school\u2019 and letting other people fill in the blanks from their own experiences.

Teachers are incredibly important to society", "You are not in the wrong. I teach CTE Automotive Technology at a HS and a CC.  I have to teach, run a shop, equip it, stock it, keep everyone safe, and allow 180+ people to work in environments that will kill them if they aren't careful.  Far cry from a History class or drawing studio.  Different is different.", "YTA.  You\u2019re actually right, your sister\u2019s job is significantly more challenging, demanding, and difficult than yours is, and she shouldn\u2019t be selling herself short by comparing herself to you.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re clearly aware of this, and felt the need to backhandedly insult her is what makes you the asshole here.", "Easy ESH.

It's hard to tell though because I have a much different relationship with my brother, we often make fun of each other but that's not to say that I don't love him. If he was a teacher and it wasn't such a sore spot for him I'd probably make a bit of fun of him.", "Nta, question was posed to you.  Your sister butted in and answered on your behalf.

They are completely different with unique challenges and require different strengths.", "ESH", "YTA - you admit yourself that you were rude and know you have an attitude. Maybe instead of acting like it's some unchangeable personality trait, you learn to communicate.\n\nMaybe your sister doesn't know the ins and outs lf your job and hence thought they were similar.

So yeah, two different jobs. It's probably just that she hasn't realised how little teaching you do, and you are definitely missing that teaching has a lot more admin and prep than you've taken account of.\n\nFor any other pair this would have gone \"She does what I do, teaching\", \"I do teach, but I mainly research and do projects\" and that would have been that. Seems like both of you have a bit of an ego and a chip on your respective shoulders is all. Points for recognising your tone was rude though.", "YTA - It sounds like you're basically an adjunct, which makes it even funnier. You probably make less money, work more hours and have way less job security than your sister.", "YTA.\n\nYour comments are ridiculously easy to read as saying \"You do two things, while I do ten different things.\"  They read as though you're saying her job is easier than yours.\n\nI'll admit bias here- I'm a public school English teacher- but public school teachers in general get a lot of shit thrown at us that tends to put us on the defensive sometimes.  And your comments, while perhaps not intended that way, are ridiculously easy to read as thinking that her work is easier than yours.", "YATA, not only because you think your job is superior to your sisters, but mainly because you are aware of beeing rude in other occassions as well, and did not bother to change this until now. (TIP: It would be so easy not to be rude by just THINKING before opening your mouth) People with low self esteem tend to wanna stay out from the mob, so please ask yourself why.", "YTA.

Maybe she shouldn't have interrupted when you were being asked, not her, but you were clearly looking down on her as a teacher and were rude.

Unless your relationship is less valuable to you than making this pretty irrelevant point.", "YTA. Yes these are different jobs and yes its totally fine to correct your sister.

Maybe you could have been more circumspect, but she interrupted you probably so you wouldn\u2019t be able to outshine her in some way.", "NTA - I think it\u2019s important that you immediately apologized for the attitude. However, as someone who has worked as a secondary school teacher and is currently working as a research assistant with only 2 lectures per week, the jobs really aren\u2019t much alike.

Not IEPs (my best friend is a HS teacher, and so is my partner's BFF), but defintely the latter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They could, but they leave it up to the lackluster disability offices and the students themselves.\n\nThere are also things I'm ***not allowed*** to know (e.g. due to FERPA or ADA), that our disability services office has clearance for.\n\nDepending on the student's wishes (in re confidentiality), I usually only have access to a 'menu' of possible 'reasonable accomodations' that the disability services specialist (who actually has access to the student's specific dx) has deemed appropriate 'in their training, expertise, and experience'.\n\nBut comeing up with the actual \\[implemented\\] accomodations is actually a 'negotiation' between me and the student.\n\n(that conversation usually goes something like \"What do you want from this list?\" \"Ok.\" \"Is there anything else that would/might help?\" \"Ok.\")\n\nI can technically/officially not give above/beyond what is on the list I'm given. It's not exactly a fireable offense (I'm tenured), but... it would probably be bad if I wasn't.\n\nI can also technically/officially not give ***any*** accomodation(s) without a letter from the disability services office.\n\nIt doesn't stop me from including a paragraph about it in my syllabus (one of the benefits of tenure, lol), but I at least throw it out there in case anyone who doesn't have a formal dx wants to hit me up.\n\nBut I have students with official 'disability letters' each semester, so I'm on a pretty first-name basis with most of the disability services staff.", "I agree that was my vote. Though the op is less of an ah than the sister who initiated the rudeness.", "There's a difference between being a paralegal and a lawyer.  If you're telling a group of friends what you do, it makes a difference.  Heck, somebody might want to come to you for advice or services, and there's a difference in what you can offer.\n\nDitto a university lecturer and a high school teacher.\n\nIt was frustrating when I was working as a systems programmer to get described as an \"IT guy\" (by a lawyer, no less).  Yeah, I can fix your Mac, but what I do is quite a bit more.  (And, to be fair, a dedicated IT person can probably do a better job of fixing your Mac that me -- I'm not up on all the latest tricks.)", "It depends on your perspective. \n\nFirstly, I love how you are calling me obtuse. We are having a difference of opinion, and you so quickly resort to *ad hominem* insults.\n\nLook at it from the perspective of the average lay person. As an average Joe, my experience with a high school teacher and a college professor was largely the same. I come in, sit down, and listen to a lecture/lesson. This was often followed by some sort of assignment. They would take up the assignment, assign a grade, and give it back. This grade served to determine my relative understanding or mastery of said subject, and would determine if I passed or failed the course.\n\nYour analogy is flawed from this perspective. I, once again as an average Joe, realize that the functions of a Doctor WILDLY differ from that of an EMT. An EMT is pretty much responsible for stabilizing me and getting me to the hospital, where the Doctor takes over and actually treats the underlying condition, which ultimately will save my life.\n\nAt the end of the day, my point is not to belittle either High School Teachers or College Professors. What I\u2019m saying is that, from an end-user perspective, most students interact with them in pretty much the same way. This is where the \u2018distinction without a difference\u2019 statement comes from.\n\nWithin the context of this specific discussion, OP didn\u2019t really need to call their sister out on this point in front of friends. They could have had this particular debate later between themselves.

Anyone can see what they're trying to express. Wait... Is this the brother from OP's post?", "Ok but no one who\u2019s not a cook has any idea what the difference between the two is.

Chef v housekeeper is clearer.", "Both cook most of the time and don't do much else, so sucks as an analogy.

That\u2019s simply not the case, and I\u2019ve explained why.\n\nI wonder why you\u2019re becoming emotional and condescending about this subject. I expect you have an axe to grind here.

That\u2019s what a line cook does, ergo it\u2019s a different job. Most of the time when an executive chef cooks it\u2019s because they\u2019re developing a menu, or they work at a very small restaurant without a fully fleshed out crew. \n\nAlso I\u2019m literally not pissed off at all, nor do I think of teachers as a lowly position or professor as a prestigious one. OP could work at the smallest shittiest state college imaginable while their sister works at the top private high school on earth, I have no context you don\u2019t have. A ton of my family are/were teachers and I have a ton of respect for their career, but it is just factually different than being a researcher/professor at a university. You\u2019re the only pissed off one here buddy.", "Hmm just like if you work at restaurant that only has cooks and no chef, she wouldn\u2019t be able to be promoted without applying for something else", "They do not spend 80% of their time cooking, how on earth did you take that as they don\u2019t cook at all?", "You're the only one taking issue. The rest of us understand and agree.\n\nBetter to stay on topic than pick apart semantics unnecessarily as you aren't achieving anything.", "Sure, but why is having a clearer match relevant when it\u2019s an anecdote intended for Reddit readers? It would not land the same way.\n\nThank you for explaining what an executive chef is. Do they tend to be the executive chef of multiple restaurants?", "> You\u2019re the only pissed off one here buddy.\n\nYeah, I'm so pissed off at all those downvotes...\n\nBut honestly, you're right \u2013 I totally missed the \u201cexecutive\u201d bit.", "No. The analogy doesn\u2019t work. Sorry.", "You're trying to nitpick my analogy, so I'm returning the favor.  Point made?", "Yeah you\u2019re all wrong lol\n\nThis is a bad analogy referencing a different situation, not relevant to OPs post (in which he is still the asshole regardless)", "Because the anecdote should relate to the thing it\u2019s referencing if it\u2019s being used as evidence in an argument, when you change the basic concept it changes the relevancy to the original point. \n\nAnd yeah kinda, executive chefs typically are only in larger kitchens or restaurants with multiple locations/kitchens. In a smaller restaurant like a local mom or pop type deal the executive chef, head chef and chef de cuisine roles typically get blurred together.", "No, because your analogy is still a poor one, no matter how much you try and pick apart my better on \ud83d\ude02"]}
