Since you mentioned that your kids are old enough to discuss the economy but still needing an allowance I\u2019m guessing early to mid-teens and yeah- they have the right to be pessimistic about what their lives and opportunities could look like in a few years\u2026 \nInstead of punishing them for their negativity (which is clearly only breeding more negativity so not helpful?), try incentivizing or even just engaging in more positivity yourself. Find good news to share with them in their topics (they bring up the roll back of child labor laws in US, mention the neighboring state introduced free lunches for all school age children for example to contrast) or ask them how they would solve the problem to challenge them to think about what they can do to have a positive impact.", "YTA\n\nIf you want them to be happy why are you actively making their lives worse?
