I would look for something like Toys for Tots or a food pantry where your kids can volunteer.  By volunteering and giving to the community, it might help to alter your kids' perspectives through the people they meet and even the experience itself.  Try and make it a family activity, but don't force this either.

Speaking from my own experience, sometimes the act of building a happy, positive environment is actually the attempt to build an emotional fortress against depression and anxiety, and any negative thought becomes a threat against that fortress.

OP, real talk. Are they cynical or are you not able to handle discussions of realistic societal issues because you\u2019re so sensitive to negativity from past trauma? What you are practicing is actually called toxic positivity and it has real roots in trauma. Have you been to therapy to handle your issues? Simply being optimistic does not mean you have handled things. It\u2019s a red flag you\u2019ve actually buried them instead of addressing them. And now you\u2019re forcing your \u201cpositivity\u201d onto your kids when they have very real concerns about the world they\u2019re growing up in and need reassurance that they will be okay, that their parents will be there to help and support them. But instead you\u2019re teaching your children to bury their emotions and that you will not be emotionally available to them. Get therapy. You don\u2019t sound like you have handled your past traumas at all.", "YTA.\n\nIt *is* controlling to tax people for expressing their thoughts and emotions that don't suit your taste. While I understand how annoying it might be to be around people who are constantly cynical or negative, I'm also wondering if they are actually that negative or if you're someone who lives by toxic positivity, which is equally harmful. Meaning, you bury your head in the sand about any difficult but real things and plaster it over with a smile and sweep difficult stuff under the rug, essentially ignoring problems with an attitude of if you never discus this it doesn't exist.\n\n This is just as bad and leads to adults who are incapable of dealing with difficult things because they simply ignore them or in relationships they invalidate others feelings because they're uncomfortable with hard things. Or like you, they try to control and force everyone else to be happy and positive 24/7. I had an ex who did this and when I met their family I realized it was the way their entire family handled stuff. They never dealt with anything difficult or talked about hard stuff and everyone had a seemingly pleasant but superficial relationship with each other and with reality. It was like being around Stepford people. \n\nIt was awful in our relationship as no problem was ever addressed or acknowledged and I was made out to be a negative person for even acknowledging issues. It led to me being pretty lonely and resentful in that relationship because I was expected to only talk about happy things or I was silenced or scolded as though I was creating problems by simply talking about problems. There was no depth and I felt like they didn't know me very well since I was only allowed to express positive things, which is only a fraction of life and my inner world. Do you want that for your kids?\n\n\nLife is complex. No one has to be happy or positive 24/7 and I agree negativity 24/7 isn't good either. But positivity isn't the full scope of our emotions and feelings, and that's OK.  I would urge you to examine if you're a positive person in a healthy way or if your own traumas have led to you being terrified of difficult topics and emotions so you bypass them with over positivity such that you're also trying to control other people around you to join in as a way to keep your own anxieties at bay.\n\n Perhaps you should have a family discussion about this or your own therapy or family therapy to work this through. Or, more simply, you can talk to your kids and offer other more positive perspectives. Be more curious about your kids' opinions and talk things through and allow them them to be heard. There are lots of scary things happening in the world and it seems much better to talk about them and maybe pose some alternative ideas after actually listening to their fears and anxieties, rather than simply shutting it down by  trying to force positivity in a controlling and tyrannical way which won't have the effect you think it will.", "YTA\n\nHave you considered that there's a lot of really shitty things going on in the world that might justify cynicism and frustration? And that talking about it doesn't necessarily make them miserable people, just aware that right now the world is shit and they want to talk about it? \n\nPutting your head in the sand doesn't make you happier, just naive.", "YTA\n\nNothing irritates me more than people forcing their cheeriness onto others. People are allowed to have emotions that aren't happiness, and we should not be punished for it. Not to mention, the people that I have met that are overly cheery are usually using it to cover up how unhappy they actually are.\n\nYou are literally teaching your children that they need to lie about their feelings to you because you can only tolerate happiness. It's ridiculous.", "YTA. Toxic positivity is tiring and repression is damaging. Do I think you could both balance each other out if you tried? absolutely. but you're not going to get there by living in an \"ignorance is bliss\" state and minimizing the less than cheery things that we, and especially kids, face today. Why dont you engage your kids on these real issues and fears and really try to listen and understand and discuss them earnestly instead of just saying \"shut up and smile\"? I do agree with the fact that it's VERY draining to be around chronically negative people but it sounds like there are legitimate worries and stressors going on here. I think having a vulnerable conversation could go a long way where you express your views and the why you are the way you are. You also need to show your kids that how they feel *does* matter, that their feelings arent \"inconvenient\" for you. Maybe they would ironically be happier if you actually practiced this. I'm still recovering from a \"if you have a problem then you're the problem\" and \"smile and bite your tongue\" upbringing.", "YTA: Forced toxic positivity is bullshit.

There's a huge difference between being genuinely pessimistic and simply recognizing we live in a really fucked up world. \n\nSecond of all, OP is discouraging his kids from having and expressing their own opinions. It's unfair to force your unrealistic outlook onto everyone around you, especially with a measure as extreme as this 'tax.' I'd also like to take a moment to note how the tax thing has absolutely nothing to do with the study on smiling that OP brought up. An example of what \\*actually\\* implementing this idea would look like is saying that a negative comment has to be followed up with a positive one. This sort of method would encourage positive thoughts as well while still allowing room for self-expression and maybe even generating some fun times and good humor. The tax thing doesn't communicate any lesson of value, except perhaps that dad doesn't know how to communicate with his kids like an adult and doesn't like his children to have their own opinions and outlooks on the world. The punishment doesn't fit the \"crime\" and it only serves to be frustrating and generate even more of the bad moods and pessimism you hate so much.

You may have had shit in your life but it would have been a helluva lot easier being a white man. Not easy, easier.
