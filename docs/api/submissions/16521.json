That kind of disparity and unfair distribution already says a lot about your marriage.\n\nEspecially now that he is unemployed and not contributing to the household financially, he should step up and takeover all of the household and childcare responsibilities. Seems pretty straightforward to me", "NTA.   He latched onto the phrase \u201cwithout the kids\u201d as if *being with his children* is something to dread.\n\nIt\u2019s not.\n\nThe argument is this:\n\nHe has eight hours a day when he is not working or hanging out with living humans who need care and attention.\n\nYou spend those hours working for a wage.   How does he spend those hours?", "NTA, as if he is treating your WORKING as if you are sat on a beach with a cocktail. \n\nThey are his children and its his house too, he can look after them. The fact you are even here asking if you are the asshole suggests to me that you need a bit more respect for yourself and your contributions to the relationship. \n\nTo be fair to him - he has just lost his job and it sounds like he is in rough place, maybe that is why he called you selfish?", "NTA whatsoever.

They're his kids, too.", "NTA \n\nWhether he\u2019s *temporarily* unemployed, or it becomes more than that, he needs to pull his weight around the house. And not just when you are sick. \n\nThe way I see it is that if one partner works and the other doesn\u2019t (for whatever reason), the one not working needs to be pulling their weight in school runs, housework, gardening, etc. They have the time on their hands, so there\u2019s really no excuse (beyond job hunting, which doesn\u2019t take all day every day). \n\nIf he worked and you were a SAHM, he\u2019d expect you to do it all. So, same goes. Feels a bit hypocritical and a tad misogynistic that it should all be up to you. *Housework is for women*, and all that. Yeah, no. Get your head out your ass and do your share buddy! \n\nIt might help to write out a list of tasks that you do every day besides your paying job. He might view it differently if he saw it all laid out before him. I doubt it, but it\u2019s worth a shot. \n\nNip this laziness in the bud and tell him to do his share!", "NTA \u2014 is he okay?

He's obviously hurting and depressed and struggling with what's happened.   \nTalk to him.  Try and find out what he's feeling.   He's lost a huge part of his identity and it's not easy.   But he does need to stand up.   Make him watch Mr Mom from the 80's", "INFO: Is he looking for a new job or is the plan for him to be a SAHM?", "NTA. But it's also a little bit your fault. You married a man who clearly thinks that housework and childcare is a woman's thing.\nHere at home, my husband already knows: I'm the breadwinner, so he takes care of the house. No discussions.", "In a fair, just world the best way to approach this is that you should both have the same amount of leisure time.  If he\u2019s not spending most of that child-free time on things like job applications, it is entirely reasonable to expect him to pick up a lot of the housework.\n\nUnfortunately, if you were doing it all before even though you were working, you\u2019ve probably trained your husband that the housework and childcare is your domain.  You\u2019ve let your household be 4 children you take care of instead of 2 adults pitching in equally.  This is a big change of roles, and it sounds like you haven\u2019t done anything to talk about this or convey that you (reasonably) think there should be a change.  After all these years of being tended, there\u2019s a decent chance he won\u2019t be willing to take any part of what has been your role, but you\u2019re not going to know if you don\u2019t communicate when you\u2019re both ready to hear each other.

How quickly does he expect to have another job?", "Wow. That's - very insulting and belittling.\n\nWhy do you do everything? That's not fair nor sustainable. Quite apart from him being unemployed, he should be doing his fair share every day.\n\nI can understand that he's stressed right now, but I imagine you are too. I think you need to sit down when you're both cooler and have a real discussion about household duties - not just in the (hopefully) short term, but ongoing.\n\nNTA.", "This is interesting because I\u2019m sure if OP was a husband asking about a similar situation with his wife, I guarantee everyone would be voting YTA.\n\nYTA - just cause you\u2019re working doesn\u2019t mean all the household work becomes his job.", "Your husband is a dick.

Then bring it up again from the perspective of both of you need to contribute to the household and while your happy to help him make job interviews until he gets a job the way he contributes is with housework.", "NTA to expect him to step up but maybe have a *little* more compassion in the short term - he got fired *four days ago*. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with redundancy before and the first few weeks were hell for my mental health. I felt worthless and ashamed and pretty much wanted to die. I also became extremely short tempered and sensitive to criticism.\n\nI know from male friends who\u2019ve been through it that there can be an extra layer of shame and guilt due to the belief that they\u2019re supposed to be the breadwinner/family provider (no matter how harmful and outdated that belief may be). I imagine this puts a lot of pressure on you too, being the main breadwinner for the foreseeable future, so I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re also a bit sensitive at the moment.\n\nWhile it might seem reasonable to you to expect him to get fired on Monday and then pick up the slack on all household and child rearing duties on Tuesday, it\u2019s really not a lot of time to process and deal with the stress and anxiety of job loss. You getting angry and reminding him that you were working may have felt like a passive aggressive reminder that he\u2019s unemployed, even if you didn\u2019t mean it that way.\n\nHave you had the conversation about expectations, roles and duties while he\u2019s not working yet? If yes, and he hasn\u2019t stepped up, then you definitely have grounds to be pissed off. But if you haven\u2019t discussed it yet and you just expected him to step up and take over - maybe take a moment to put yourself in his shoes, apologise for your part and have the conversation (to be clear - he should apologise too).\n\nIf he hasn\u2019t done so already, I also suggest he speak to a counsellor/employee assistance program on the mental health aspect, and if he\u2019s receiving outplacement support as part of a severance package they can also be really great at helping to develop an action plan - such as reactivating professional networks, updating r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and working on applications and interview skills. Sometimes having that action plan in place can help with the feelings of shame and worthlessness. \n\nGood luck - this is obviously a really stressful time for both of you, but I honestly think this is just a case of poor communication. I hope you can sort it out and get back into a routine that works for both of you soon.", "Why was he fired?", "INFO: Is he currently engaged in an elaborate job search/out doing interviews/meeting with headhunters or something similar to find a new job? Or has he taken on something else since he's been fired?", "Is he okay mentally? A lot of men attach much of their self worth to jobs. Personally I quit my last long time job (super high stress not enough pay) and despite the fact I was the one to leave I felt like absolute useless garbage for a few weeks, like I had wasted my skills, missing people and worrying they got burdened with my old work because I knew those cheap assholes wouldn\u2019t pay to replace me.

He also has severe ADHD and struggles to remember what needs to be done or to get started on tasks, so part of it is my fault for enabling him because I\u2019d just do it all instead of nagging him.", "Oh no, he\u2019s been depressed since the twins were born 2 years ago and in a high stress job (so it\u2019s actually probably a good thing in the long run that he\u2019s not there anymore).\n\nBut his depression is the reason why there was already a housework disparity in our relationship but I don\u2019t think I can handle being the only one working and doing everything while he sits around at home without starting to hate him.", "He\u2019s looking for a new job. We can\u2019t live on my salary alone. But the kids are still going to daycare so he has 8 hours a day alone. I think that\u2019s enough time to apply for jobs and get some housework done.", "Because he is the same Worthless Guy at work, that he is at home?", "Did you read it? The kids go to day care during the day. He\u2019s not home with them.", "The fact that you think of it as 'nagging' instead of 'reminding him of his responsibilities' is telling.", "May I ask why he got fired?", "Does he really have ADHD though? Can he perform tasks at work without nagging?", "NTA. As someone with adhd myself, I would like to offer some advice that will likely go against most other comments about him. Something that's common in relationships with an adhd partner is that the other one defaults to acting like their parent and doing things for them, but that actually just hurts both of you. Nagging is also unproductive and will only cause mutual resentment. Most of us have never had anyone in our lives actually try to understand our daily struggles and just judge us for not being as capable as a neurotypical person. The biggest thing though, will be his willingness to improve. If he can't accept he needs to do better, that's not ADHD, it's just being a bad partner. \n\nFirst, ADHD may be the reason for a lot of his issues, it does not give him a blanket excuse. If he is not being treated for it, therapy or medication, that needs to be his first priority.\n\nSecondly, start talking to him about his struggles with adhd and what kind of accommodations would help him. For an example, we have struggles with our working memory, out of sight out of mind is a very, very real thing for most of us. Instead of doing chores yourself or nagging him, ask him about getting a whiteboard. Put the chores on it and how often they need done. He know has a visual list/reminder of what needs done without asking you.\n\nI guess essentially what I'm saying here is that you guys can overcome this. But it's going to come down to him wanting to improve himself, and how willing you are to understand his ADHD and help him get there.", "Tell him that.", "Seems like a very convenient depression. It'll probably get better once the kids are in college, and he'll celebrate with a fancy new sports car and a bimbo. \n\nOP, you have 3 kids and a full-time job. You have every right to expect that your husband contributes equally to the household (whatever balance of money, housework and childcare makes sense for your situation). Don't let him push it all on you.", "Has he ever been fired from a job before?  If not, that can be a pretty bad emotional blow and he might need a few days to regroup.  It sounds like there\u2019s been an imbalance in housework for a while now and that\u2019s definitely something to address, but conflating it with the job loss is not the most constructive approach.  Particularly because that makes it easy for him to view his participation in housework as a consequence of his unemployment, and thus to stop doing it when he finds a new job.", "Do you know him? Is the OPs Alt account?\n\nOr are you just spamming comments?", "That\u2019s a good point. I think part of my frustration is that deep down I\u2019m angry at him for losing his job because things are going to be really tight now (we each made about the same salary so his job was about half of our income).\n\nBut I just want a freaking break sometimes. Our kids are so attached to me and yesterday I was about to scream if I heard the word \u201cmommy\u201d one more time.\n\nWe haven\u2019t had time to talk about how things will be til he finds a new job so maybe it\u2019s a little bit my fault for not discussing my expectations.", "I hear all of that, and would be losing my mind in your shoes. Hopefully this weekend you guys can figure out a plan going forward that gets you some breathing room while he\u2019s looking for a job.", "Can you have your parents, in-laws, or friends watch the kids for a few hours this weekend?

When you can do so calmly, with lower emotional level, try to discuss what the future looks like; will he be job hunting, etc., how can you reasonably address the loss of income and how everyone can manage?", "NTA\n\nsomeone is not working or if there is a big income difference, it is always fair to expect that person to pick up the slack elsewhere", "Nta.  Similarly my husband is a SAHD.  It too, started when he was fired from his job (I wasn't angry though, we both hated him working a high risk job for low pay & shit benefits).  My husband also suffers from depression and in the past had even expressed suicidal thoughts to me.  All that being said, he is a fantastic stay at home parent. He homeschools our 2 kids, takes them to their home school events (our city is big into home schooling and has events for the kids to socialize). Hubs does almost all the household chores (minus the ones our kids are old enough to help with), he does all the yard work, maintenance on our vehicles, grocery shopping, pet care, pretty much everything that has to do with the house. The only thing he doesn't do is my laundry, and that's only because I have clothes that need to be washed certain ways and he's worried about messing up anything.  Your husband might be upset with the sudden change in his life, but he's still a parent. He needs to step up now and accept this role.  I will say that I do try and cook meals 1x a week and on the weekends I normally take over all cooking duties and some cleaning to give hubs a few days off.  It's a balancing act, but having a parent at home is really nice. I won't lie.  Hopefully your husband will come around soon and start helping out more.", "NTA.

If OP was a SAHM, expecting her to do more than 50% of the chores would be abuse.", "If he's using depression as an excuse to not carry his weight, and also not actively seeking help for his depression, he's just being lazy.", "He really should seek proper help.  You can\u2019t bring that mindset into relationships and not expect problems.", "The fact that he even needs constant reminding instead of making a list is also telling.\n\nLike, this dude had a high stress job, but somehow figured out how to do it so he should be able to figure out how to take care of his family.\n\nThen again, he was fired so maybe he\u2019s just a dumpster fire of a person.", "You clearly don't actually understand how ADHD works. It is possible for OP's husband to both have ADHD AND be a lazy asshole.", "yeah i manage my adhd with notes and reminders. it's not a cure but it helps. he can use tools to help with his executive dysfunction and working memory but he hasn't because he refuses to do his share. this is weaponized incompetence.", "Fair. Either way he shouldn\u2019t be using it as an excuse to not contribute.", "Your need for regular breaks from the children predates the job loss.\n\nYall need a painting schedule, even when he goes back to work.
