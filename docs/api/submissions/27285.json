{"id": 27285, "submission_id": "16nmzvn", "title": "WIBTA for expecting my gluten-free friend to accommodate my diet?", "selftext": "I (23F) am not sure if this is the right community but I was pondering this question after having dinner at a friend's house a few nights ago. To clarify - I am not *on* a diet, I just have no food restrictions. My friend (23F) , let's call her Alice, is gluten free (gf). Not celiac but still pretty severe. I am not minimizing her dietary needs, my SIL is also gf so I am well aware the severity of their symptoms and how limiting it is.\n\nI have Alice over for dinner pretty frequently, and I *always* make sure to either have the meal be gf or I made a smaller version of it on the side that is gf for her. She has always really appreciated it and I genuinely have no problem doing it, in fact I kind of enjoy it. I think it is important to make guests feel welcome in your home.\n\nSo a few nights ago I went over to her place and she cooked us dinner. Gf plain pasta and chicken with the tiniest amount of seasoning that it was practically plain as well. She served me my plate without asking what I wanted so I felt like I had to eat what was put in front of me. The pasta is what got me lol, I know gf pasta isn't the worst and maybe it was just her cooking skills but it was barely edible. The chicken was pretty rough too, and I struggled to finish my plate. Alice finished hers no problem and I just couldn't manage to finish the pasta. I ate the chicken and ate about half of the pasta on my plate. My appetite was just gone. I could tell she was a little miffed when we cleaned up but didn't say anything. I also *never* said anything complaining or criticizing her cooking or food. I also didn't ask her to make me anything separate.\n\nSo, here I am a few days later and a little bugged that she didn't even try to put in the effort to make a meal that would fit my diet better. Like is it that hard to bread the chicken in flour and breadcrumbs real quick? Or make a second pot of pasta that wasn't gf?\n\nI guess I am just asking what the etiquette is and if I am unreasonable for expecting her to accommodate my diet just as much as I accommodate hers. And yes, I understand that her diet is an actual issue and mine has nothing to do with my health. I guess I was a little annoyed after all the effort I have gone to to accommodate her diet and she just assumed that gf pasta was cool with me.\n\nOh and for context - I offered a couple times to bring food or anything to help with the meal. I would've been happy to buy regular pasta and throw it in a pot myself. She repeatedly said she didn't need anything and that it was all taken care of.\n\nSo, WIBTA for expecting my gluten-free friend to accommodate my diet?\n\nEDIT: Hahaha okay okay I get it! I'm the AH. All good, it was more of a query and I was mostly just curious what the etiquette entails. I still think the cross contamination argument is a little invalid here because her allergy isn't as severe as that. Definitely a bit entitled on my part to expect that when I don't have any restrictions. I guess I just really hate gf pasta  ", "created_utc": 1695220830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nmzvn/wibta_for_expecting_my_glutenfree_friend_to/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can eat anything she can, but she can't eat everything you can.", "YWBTA, and you said it yourself - you\u2019re not the one with the diet restriction. I have a friend with a severe GF allergy and any level of contamination would trigger a response. She would never cook with gluten due to the risk of contamination.\n\nI was vegetarian for a while and when I hosted friends, I never provided a meat-based protein option as 1) I didn\u2019t want to buy meat, 2) I didn\u2019t want to use my pans to cook meat, and 3) I didn\u2019t know how to cook meat well.", "You don't have \"a diet\", you have preferences.

Ie, you can eat anything she could choose to make, and she cannot eat anything you can choose to make. Furthermore, her making special accommodations for you in her kitchen could be harmful for her if her condition is bad enough. \n\nSo in summary, YWBTA for asking her to make accommodations for her that you do not need by comparing them to accommodations you make for her that she does need. And her being a not-great cook is beside the point.", "YWBTA since you won\u2019t get sick from eating her cooking, but flip it and she will. Cross contamination can be a concern too. \n\nI don\u2019t think the issue is diet so much as she\u2019s not a good cook. Unsalted pasta and unseasoned chicken? There\u2019s gluten free flours she could bread with, though they don\u2019t taste as good. Or like, spices? Bland chicken isn\u2019t like a steak, you gotta do something to give it flavor! She could have also asked if you wanted anything or if that would be alright instead of just assuming.", "YTA \n\nSome food allergies, including gf, aren't just triggered when the food is ingested. Touching and inhaling could easily trigger her reaction. Why should she bring her allergen into her home contaminating other things?", "YTA. Your friend's cooking sounds pretty crappy, but you'd like her to bring items that sicken her, literally, into her home and potentially contaminate everything around her to accommodate your tastes and preferences.", "YTA\n\nYou are perfectly able to eat gluten free food.  She is *not* able to eat gluten.\n\nShe did \u201caccommodate your diet\u201d - because, as *you even said*, you have no food restrictions!  You can eat her gluten free food!  Gluten free food isn\u2019t only for people who can\u2019t have gluten - you can eat it too.  It won\u2019t hurt you.  There was no reason for her to make separate food for you.", "YTA yes its unreasonable to pretend your friend can learn to cook just to please you. Yes, this is not gf or not, seems evident your friend is simply to a great cook. Next time or avoid the invitation or just shut it. It will be also unreasonable for your friend to cook something different for you as you DO NOT have dietary restrictions, that means you can eat anything.", "YWBTA\n\nIt is kind of you to make an effort when cooking for her, I guess she doesn't have the same cooking skills as you, hence the meal not being great. But she still made an effort to cook for you in return. \n\nShe doesn't go for the less appetising pasta by preference, she has no choice but to eat it. I'm sure she massively wishes she could have breaded chicken or nicer pasta too... but she can't, so expecting her to prepare the yummier stuff too, only to then have to go without herself is not really fair. You just have to have the gluten free pasta this one time, she has to suffer it for a lifetime. \n\nAlso, asking you to compromise and eat the slightly less tasty pasta version would not be equal to you poisoning her with food she physically can't eat, so it isn't fair to compare your accommodation to hers, or her lack of. Phrasing simply being able to eat everything as a dietary requirement does not make it so.", "YTA\n\nSo sorry she didn't drop a filet in front of you.

You're not on a diet and have no dietary restrictions so it's not on her to prepare you any specific food. You have no accommodations to be met.

But that doesn't mean she didn't accommodate you.", "YWBTA. She cannot eat gluten. You can eat it or not. Not eating gluten is not going to cause you harm. Eating or breathing gluten (like flour dust if she is making cookies) would cause her harm. \n\nIt is hard to bread things in gluten in a gluten free space. That makes the space no longer gluten free. Gluten sticks to stuff. She's have to go through a whole sanitization process to make her kitchen gluten free again after that. \n\nThere is food that is good without gluten...have a salad with grilled chicken and homemade dressing. No crutons. Have a charcuterie board with fruit and cheese and GF sausage (some sausage contains wheat as a binder, some does not)", "YWBTA\n\nYour friend isn't a good cook. \n\nChicken and sauce with pasta is a perfectly decent meal.

That's what severely allergic people do: stay away from the sorce of the allergy.", "YTA--gluten free food is within your diet, so she is accommodating it. What you mean is that she should make food that you prefer, which although would be nice, is not her responsibility.\n\nAnd just to add--many people with severe gluten allergies do not want food with gluten in their kitchen at all for the obvious contamination difficulties it can create.", "YTA, you're not gluten-free intolerant, you just didn't like what she cooked. No problem if you don't like what she cooks, but your diet includes gluten-free foods. Sounds like you're just confused about the difference between your palate and your diet.", "YTA. She can\u2019t contaminate her kitchen to appease your wants. Coeliac is a serious condition and in some cases a couple bread crumbs can make a person ill. You have an issue with her cooking skills. Not the gf food.", "YTA. She's just a bad cook. That sucks, but it's not about diet accommodation. \n\nI don't eat pork. If someone comes to my house that eats pork, I will not serve them pork. I will serve them something else that BOTH of us can eat.", "YTA. Sounds like your friend is just not such a great cook. So what? A bland meal is not going to kill you. If someone cooks dinner for you I think it\u2019s bad form to whine about it.", "Gently, YTA. Why do you think a person that is gluten-free because of severe reaction will have gluten pasta in her kitchen? Or breadcrumbs? Or bread? \n\nThe difference between what you are doing is - you are NOT putting something in her dish from what you have cooked. In her case she will have to buy food she doesn't eat just to accommodate you coming once.", "YTA mostly because this is a seasoning issue. There are plenty of ways to season food without gluten. This is mostly a her cooking issue.", "YWBTA - the difference is that your dietary preferences are PREFERENCES, where as her restrictions are due to need. If you're hosting someone, accommodating their dietary needs is different than asking everyone what they'd like to eat. \n\nThe issue here isn't WHAT your friend made... it's that she sucks at cooking.

As you said you have no food restrictions but she does so that means that you can eat any of the food she cooks whether it fits your personal diet or not, she on the other can\u2019t cannot eat the food you normally cook. That is why she gets to ask for accommodations to be made and you don\u2019t.

You suffer no ill effects from a GF meal but she might suffer ill effects from preparing foods with gluten and, either way, should not be expected to serve foods she can't eat \n\nThis also sounds like she just might not be a very good cook,  in which case,  all the bread crumbs in the world won't help....or you're just being snitty about foods prepared in ways you're not used to. \n\nI suggest that you get her a gluten-free cookbook and a small selection of GF flours, pastas and sauces & put them in a cute basket for Christmas or her birthday. \n(BTW- A lot of Thai food is GF with no substitutes needed)", "YTA, \n\nyou have no food restrictions there is nothing to accommodate to", "YTA\n\nMany people who have celiac want a gluten free kitchen at home to minimize risk of cross contamination to make them sick.  \n\nSounds like she isn't great with seasoning food.

Generally something like Mexican (with corn tortillas) or burgers (with buns for them/lettuce wrap for me) are go to for guests for a casual dinner", "YTA, you can eat anything, she has a severe allergic reaction to gluten. \n\nServing gluten to you would involve contamination of her kitchen, her cooking appliances, her pantry, etc. Not to mention the potential risk to herself depending on the severity of her allergy. \n\nIf you don't like her food, state your preference to her and offer an alternative like you bringing your own food. However, given her allergy, asking her to cook gluten for you should be out of the question.", "YTA.\n\nGluten allergies aren't a diet. They are *allergies*. Of course you can't expect your friend to BREAD chicken.\n\n\"Yes, friend, please risk your health to put breadcrumbs on my chicken.\" WHAT???\n\nDo your friend a favor and educate yourself so you don't accidentally kill her, jfc.

My aunt went to the hospital and almost died before the doctors figured out what the problem is.)", "She just sounds like a terrible cook tbh, she could probably have made that so much nicer with a bit of sauce and seasoning", "YWBTA, like others said, it doesn't sound like the gluten is the issue, it's her cooking. And it's fair that she wouldn't bring gluten items in because a) gluten free foods can be prepared well, she just didn't do that, and b) she shouldn't have to worry about cross contamination in her own kitchen.", "YTA for focusing on the wrong thing. The problem doesn't seem to be  that she made GF food. It's that she's probably not a good cook generally. It is perfectly possible to cook an amazing meal without including any wheat products.

I ship it in from Target or Amazon.\n\nFill the cupboard with pure spices and avoid the combination ones unless they specifically say they are gluten free.\n\nAvoid processed foods and cook whole foods with little processing .  Make your own sauces from scratch.\n\nMy suggestion? Ask her if she\u2019s interested in cooking some meals together, and then you take the lead.  You do it in her kitchen.  If she doesn\u2019t have a lot of spices, go to the Penzey\u2019s website and buy her a gift box of spices (well, if you\u2019re a MAGAt, don\u2019t.  The owner is an anti-Trumper.). Tell her about brown rice pasta (I swear, no one knows my spaghetti or lasagna is gluten free).  Take her a starter package of some of these items or suggest you go in together to buy supplies for your first meal you cook together. Make it a shared activity to find delicious recipes and use gluten free ingredients to make them safe for her.  Instead of letting yourself get in a cycle in which you expect reciprocity, make it an equally shared experience by cooking together.\n\nYTA, but a soft one.

Restrictions are restrictions, regardless of where they stem from. People have a right to make their own choices and decisions so as long as they are not causing harm to others. \n\nBut now I think this is becoming a red herring. It's been awful to see the whole meat vs. veg debate unfold over the past several years, and people decide to go meat-free for a variety of reasons. Not all vegetarians/vegans are the same (some do it for moral reasons, others for health, environmental, cost, religious, cultural, or an entirely other reason, or a combination of reasons). We are each individuals and should be treated and respected as such.\n\nRestrictions (i.e., requirements) are different from preferences (i.e., desires).

How important is it to you to have meat options, and have you communicated this to your friends? Is there a deeper issue or pattern of your friend not keeping your other choices or interests in mind?

Not that you're saying this, but just want to lay that groundwork. \n\nSo you certainly don't *like* curry or injera. Is it to a point where it's a flat out restriction? Are your friends aware of your distates of curry and injera? This is a conversation to have.\n\nI also don't think there are sweeping answers to things like this. I'll share a few examples:\n\n* When I was vegetarian, all my friends knew. If I was inviting someone who I didn't know to a group dinner, I'd let them know that I'll be cooking a vegetarian meal so that *they* can decide whether they want to come. \n* I decided to stop being vegetarian and started eating chicken and seafood. I really wanted to do a ramen night and had a particular recipe in mind. My kitchen was not large enough to make a vegetarian miso-based broth and I didn't have the time to make enough toppings to make a vegetarian ramen that I would feel proud to serve. I let my vegetarian friends know, and they were totally understanding. They know how busy I am and our friendship runs deeper than a single event/meal.\n* I have another group of friends that do an annual steak dinner. They invited me years ago and I let them know that I do not eat red meat and do not ever plan to. They asked if I still wanted to come, and I declined as I didn't want to be a burden nor did I want to be in a steak-heavy environment. No hard feelings. They still host this annual dinner and don't reach out to me about it (and I don't expect them to). Do I get a little FOMO? Sure, but it's not a big deal...

When that's not possible, you make two (or three, or whatever) meals, or have things on the side that people can add according to their restriction. Note that this is about restrictions, things they can not/may not/choose not to eat for ethical, religious, medical, whatever reasons. If you somehow had a restriction against gluten free pasta because it makes you sick, it would have been polite of your friend to offer, for example, potatoes, which also accommodates her restriction. If your friend does not know about your gf pasta restriction, they cannot accommodate it.\nOf course you can choose to add things according to preferences, but you absolutely don't have to if they are against your own restriction.\n\nFor example, I am vegetarian. I have a friend who is not, but cannot eat many types of food because of medical issues and specific trauma. When I cook, I cook vegetarian and ask them if the ingredients I plan to use are okay for them to eat, or if I should swap them with something else. Then we have a meal both of us can eat. When they cook, they make a vegetarian version of the meal and sometimes add meat for themselves later, and don't use ingredients they cannot eat. That's called accomodating.\n\nWould you ask a muslim friend to 'accomodate' you by serving you pig? A friend that's allergic to nuts to serve you a cashew stir-fry? No, because you CAN eat things without pig or cashews, and they CANNOT eat things with it.

And while I sort of understand the argument that if you\u2019re an omnivore you can certainly eat a vegetarian meal, and it doesn\u2019t work the other way around, it still does seem like a double standard if it is required etiquette to cater to one and not consider the preferences of the other."]}
