AITA for setting this boundary that I don\u2019t want to hang out every single day?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that we live very close to each other, so enforcing this boundary is hard.

You've expressed that you cannot see him every day because you have other obligations, and don't need the distraction.\n2. He get's upset when you can't prioritize him because you have your life that has existed far longer than you two have been together. \n3. He gas lights you into making time for him. \n4. This behavior has lead to you having to lie to be able to do what you *need* to.\n5. This behavior / relationship feels like it could turn very co-dependent, and lead to him trying to control you, and thus abuse you. \n\nI would recommend making a list of the pros and cons are. It sounds like your regular life is unable to to accommodate his expectations, and your first priority should always be yourself. \n\nHe is also disrespecting you by ignoring the boundaries you're trying to establish, and that just says to me that he has no respect for your time and your life unless he can be part of every second of it. \n\nPersonally, I'd peace out.", "NTA. This is incredibly controlling of him. At best it's codependent. Is this the only controlling thing he does or is it the tip of the iceberg? \n\nBig red flag \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA\n\nIf he is so controlling and disrespectful that you feel you have to lie to him to avoid being emotionally abused, he is not a good guy.\n\nFive months into a relationship is actually the typical time when abusive and controlling partners show their true colors. \n\nThe classic book \"Why Does He Do That?\" by Lundy Bancroft may be applicable to your situation.", "NTA. He's way too clingy for you, and the fact that you're literally inventing things to get out of time with him and you've tried to let him know how you feel, I think this might not be the right relationship for either of you.  You say he's great, but guilting, begging, passive aggressiveness etc. don't sound this is that great.", "Five months in, a love so great  \nBut time apart, she just can't wait  \nHe wants her there, every single day  \nBut her social battery, doesn't have much to say  \nShe loves her alone time, it's a must  \nBut he just can't seem to adjust  \nHe guilts and begs, and makes her feel bad  \nWhen she needs some space, it makes him mad  \nEven a picture of her alone in bed  \nMakes him passive-aggressive, filling her with dread  \nShe's tried to talk, to set this boundary clear  \nBut he just says \"I love you\" and draws her near  \nSo, AITA she asks, for needing some space  \nTo recharge her battery, to find her own place  \nNo, my dear, you're not in the wrong  \nTime apart is necessary, to keep love strong.", "NTA And I would take this as a big red flag if I were you. Nothing wrong with wanting to see your partner every day if that\u2019s what both of you want but if you two don\u2019t jive on this it\u2019s going to be a problem. \n\nI am EXTREMELY independent and in every relationship I\u2019ve ever been in it\u2019s been taken as an insult or my saying I don\u2019t love them as much as they love me if I simply want to spend time alone. And it gets worse with time, not better.", "NTA. I\u2019d personally break up with him. Him guilting you is manipulative af. I wanted to spend time with my man every day and I admittedly was toxic af. I\u2019ve since grown up and we live together and have 2 daughters and I realize how important space is. I was a bit like him when I was 18 and I 100% recommend dumping him", "NTA - this level of neediness is a red flag", "You need to find someone you're more compatible with. He's clingy and needy and you're more independent and need to take time to yourself. This is going to give you no end of grief in the long term if you continue the relationship.", "NTA alone time is absolutely healthy & greatly needed to maintain healthy balance between the two of you. This level of neediness is a red flag & while he might be wonderful, wanting to be up your arse is not good.\n\nStart making meal plans with him where he can help with prep, cooking & clean up & then LEAVE when you're ready for him to go. Meal prep can be fun to do together for some people (not me, unless I specifically ask for something from you, you better stay out of my kitchen while I'm prepping & cooking. My partner has learned this & will occasionally do the dishes as I go about \"making the mess\" for easier clean up later). \n\nSet your boundaries & stick to them, if he wants to be a dick about spending time with you, then it's time to go your separate ways.", "NTA but maybe he is not the right one for you if he can't understand you, becomes aggressive etc...", "NTA. He sounds incredibly manipulative. A good partner will be understanding of your boundaries and needs- he seems only to be focused on what HE wants and doesn\u2019t see that it isn\u2019t healthy for YOU. These are serious red flags.", "NTA. \n\nBeing in love doesn\u2019t mean you need to be up each others butts 24/7. \n\nYou both need your own space to grow, to get some breathing room\u2026 some time to miss each other\u2026 otherwise you\u2019re both going to get bored really quickly. Hopefully he\u2019s not insecure.. but he does sound pretty needy. You don\u2019t need to run just yet but do have a talk with him. \n\nEveryone has or needs boundaries and breathing room\u2026", "Let's see, insecure, clingy, emotionally manipulative, ignores your needs and boundaries, makes it all about him....what's so great about this guy?  Take a step back and reexamine this relationship carefully.  If he's not willing to give you space when you ask for it now, that probably won't change later.  You are not wrong to want some space, and you are not responsible for his feelings.  NTA, but tread carefully.", "NTA ever at all.   \nRun as far away as possible.  \n\n\nSetting boundaries is an important thing. Someone demanding all of your time is too much for most people and it's generally not healthy for a relationship. Him getting upset or guilting you over it isn't a good sign either as he should respect that you want time alone or want to have time to do your own things.", "NTA. But complete wimp for putting his needs ahead of your own.", "Sounds like he might have some trust issues and that\u2019s why he wants to hangout all the time, then he knows where you\u2019re at and who you are with. \nYou are NTA, but do stop and have a good long thought about whether or not this is something you want to live with\u2026\ud83d\udea9", "These types of men NEVER CHANGE. Go live your best life without him.", "NTA, and I\u2019d be questioning why he\u2019s struggling with a simple boundary request and if that\u2019s a deal breaker", "NTA, Set boundaries,  if he can't except you need alone time then you have a problem.  Big red flag going up.  does he not have any friends to hang out with, his attitude is not healthy,  I would actually end things with him.", "NTA\n\nIt's weird that he doesn't want to give you alone time to do your thing and relax. Every couple needs their time alone because after awhile, you're not going to be able to communicate in a way that makes the relationship work.", "NTA. Ok, so he\u2019s upset that you\u2019re not respecting his boundary when his boundary is trample over your boundary. That\u2019s ridiculous, right? I love spending time with my spouse, but my spouse also grasps that I do love and need alone time. (Because we have this understanding, I can do \u201calone\u201d activities, read or something, with my spouse next to me.) That he uses guilt and passive aggressive tactics and he doesn\u2019t accept you aren\u2019t going to be next to him unless there\u2019s a reason he considers worthy is not a good sign.", "NTA and him pressuring you is a worry", "NTA, he is way controlling and suffocating", "NTA and this is a serious red flag. Imagine how it would be if the two of you were living together? Unbearable. He is way too controlling.", "wrong sub, but NTA. everyone is allowed space", "NTA sounds like this is not the relationship for either of you. Five months is long enough to know/decide.", "NAH, but I don't think you should be with him - if after only 5 months of dating you think that spending several hours together daily it's exhausting for you, this is not going to end well. Especially that you seem to be incompatible when it comes to your expectations.", "NAH. It's perfectly fine for you to want/need alone time. You should be with someone who feels the same. It is perfectly fine for him to want to see his girlfriend every day. He should be with someone who feels the same.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and saying YTA but only because you lied and deceived him about what you were doing. If I found out my gf was deceiving me or lying it would be a dealbreaker, I\u2019d feel very hurt and disrespected. If you didn\u2019t have that issue then you wouldn\u2019t be the AH because I think he\u2019s being immature tbh. I\u2019m in a long distant relationship though so idk what it\u2019s like to be with someone 24/7.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially if you explained why(which it\u2019s sounds like you did) and he continues to be passive aggressive , he\u2019ll probably just get worse if you stay. Also good on you for setting boundaries, that can be hard.", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly fine to have alone time. I'm not sure what your boyfriend is thinking, but he may be confused about what you're asking for. When my SO and I had this conversation, I had to basically flat-out tell them that dealing with people exhausts me and that sometimes I need alone time to recollect myself, and that it had nothing to do with them.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with spending time alone. There's a man in my bldg, he's married, and he and his spouse don't live together (she lives in an apt in the next block). It works for them.\n\nOf course, it doesn't work for everybody. Some people do like to be together every day. Nothing wrong with that either. \n\nBut both of you have to agree, and you don't, you're incompatible. And he sounds like he's being kind of a jerk about it, so that's why I went NTA instead of NAH. But this may be a dealbreaker for you guys.", "NTA. That's not a boyfriend though. That's a puppy.", "NTA but this is a red flag. He\u2019s incredibly needy and manipulative.

I understand not staying together every available hour, but just a passing hey what\u2019s up and kiss out the door doesn\u2019t sound bad. Some people need that, some don\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t sound like your compatible", "NTA! This is not healthy and he\u2019s not respecting when you say no. You need to be able to say no to your partner. Also, not only do you need alone time to decompress, you need time to have your own life - friends, hobbies, responsibilities, etc. I went through something vaguely similar with my girlfriend when we were at right about 5 months, we had been spending a lot of time together (sleepovers ~4 times a week). I said this was stressing me with my work schedule and trying to make friends in a new city. We quickly worked it out and now we have a really great present engaged date 1-2 times a week. I would say to figure out what is an amount of time in an average week you would feel comfortable spending together, and tell him that and that you\u2019re serious about it. If he can\u2019t respect it he isn\u2019t compatible with you and should get the boot.", "NTA I was in a relationship like this and it wasn\u2019t until later I realised how many red flags he had waved and I\u2019d just not seen. He was emotionally manipulating me from the first to have control of me and always be there to make decisions. What your BF is doing is also emotional manipulation and then goes mad and has arguments when he realises your not doing what he wants. They do this as eventually you know not spending time with them will cause so much drama that you can\u2019t be othered with and just give in. Then they change to use this tactic on anything they want to manipulate and punish you into submitting over.   \nBreak off your relationship as you\u2019re already desperate for peace and he still keeps stomping in your boundaries and own time and say in your life.", "I'm honestly not sure if he's clingy or controlling but either way you are NTA", "Nope right out of this.

In hindsight, it was a red flag.\n\nBenefit from my hindsight please!", "NTA, but it sounds like you two are incompatible.

I am the same way your boyfriend is and want to spend every waking moment with my partner. If I had someone that would rather be alone when they could spend that time with me I would 100% be offended. I have \"me time\" when I'm sleeping or go to bed or get ready or when I'm driving etc. I'd rather be with my person.

I was extremely anxiously attached like your boyfriend is. I love spending time with my partner, but I know he was very drained like you, and I had poor reactions to my partner wanting alone time as well. I wish I could go back and change it so that I could have been a bit more independent - we also were first together during lockdown so it complicated things, but nonetheless. all that to say that I don't think you're in the wrong at all. I think it would be worthwhile for you to have a stronger reaction/conversation with him about this. he hasn't been able to listen to a gentle tone, so I think it's only fair to show hurt/anger more. it sounds weird and maybe a little aggressive, but it honestly works. if it doesn't, then you will find something better in the future :)", "Girl, please please please break up with him.\n\nI was with a \u201chim\u201d for literally only a few months, and the demanding doesn\u2019t stop there.

It spreads to your alone time being \u201ctoo much\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d. It spreads to you \u201cnot valuing him enough\u201d.
