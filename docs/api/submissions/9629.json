You are being fair.  You are being more than fair if you are willing to pay an extra 25% over your actual portion. They are bringing adult children who have families of their own? They should contribute as well.  Or you could say you will pay 1/3 but you want 1/3 of the beds.  See if they think that is fair.", "NTA. You're being used to subsidise other people. Tell them it's not happening like that. Edit: They think it's cheap and unfair? Two of you versus how many? I'm astounded at their audacity and lack math skills. Seriously though, they really are trying to take advantage of you.", "NTA that is completely not cool to have you pay 1/3rd the cost where you're 1/10th of the people coming", "Nta. You shouldn't have to pay for your siblings entire extended family. I would maybe take the total cost, divide it by the total amount of ppl going to see what it is per person for the entire trip. Take that total and pay for yourself,  your partner and also your parents.  You paid your part as well as your parents.  Your siblings can now pay for only their own families.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t the numerous adult children pay for themselves?", "Your way is fair.  You don't need to help pay for all the kids rooms.  They aren't your kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA- they are trying to take advantage of you. If your nieces and nephews are old enough to have their own children they are old enough to pay for their vacation. Why should you split the bill for 24 other people excluding yourselves and your parents. Your proposal sounds fair\u2026 Pay for your share and split your parents share with your siblings. Every other adult can pay for themselves and their children.", "NTA and good lord, that's crazy. I thought my relative asking me to split the cost of their children coming was presumptuous but I now have a new bar for that.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, \u201cI have an elderly English sheepdog who is not invited.\u201d is pure gold.", "NTA : They all know *damn* well that there\u2019s no reason to have you pay for more than yourself and your parents. You are not the person bringing a handful of people on, they are. They should pay the price of bringing everyone and their cousin, not you. (By \u2018they\u2019 I mean *not* your parents but you know who(s) obv)", "I think what you suggested is very fair given the drastic cost difference between siblings per person going.

By their logic if you\u2019re paying for a \u201cspecial occasion\u201d *for your parents* then you should split the bill to cover your *parents* and no one else. If *they* want more family members to come, then *they* pay the expenses for the bigger boat. \n\nThey\u2019re trying to get you to pay more so they can offer a free trip to other people. That\u2019s a really AH move.", "NTA. \n\n>My siblings think I'm being cheap and unfair\n\nThat's exactly how to describe them - they effectively want you to subsidise them. If so many people weren't going, you wouldn't need to spend so much.", "NTA. You are responsible for yourself and 1/3 of your parents' expenses. Trying to make you pay for the children, grandchildren etc is your siblings trying to take advantage.", "NTA.\n\nYou can do per person, or you can divide another way.   \n\nWhen my family has done things like this in the past, we have always divided by ROOM, not by family.   So if 3 kids pile into one shared room, they count as a single room.    But if they have a separate room from their parents, their parents are paying for 2 rooms, not one.", "I think trying to get your adult kids a free vacation under the guise of \u201cparents anniversary \u201c is pretty damn cheap of them. \n\nTell them you\u2019ll pay a portion of your parents expenses and that is it. If all these people want a vacation they can chip in to make it \u201cmemorable for your parents\u201d. NTA", "NTA. They\u2019re lucky ducks because \u00dc are choosing to pay even more than one penny for their vacation.", "\"My siblings think I'm being cheap and unfair since it is a special occasion and we are doing it for our parents. \"\n\nSounds like they're happy to spend your money. Each of you (brothers and sisters) should be paying 1/3 of your parent's fare as a gift to them. If your brother and sister want to bring a gaggle of family, that's on them. It's not your duty to subsidize the vacation for all the nieces and nephews.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s kind of messed up for you two to pay the same as like 15 other people", "NTA - they are asking you to subsidize their family vacation.  I would die on this hill.", "NTA You are definitely the one being fair! Your siblings are trying to make you shoulder a lot more of the bill. Sharing trip costs PER PERSON is literally the way the entire world does this kind of thing. Tell you siblings to stop trying to cheat you and your spouse. Divide the total cost (maybe y\u2019all need to include a food budget as well-considering it\u2019s a houseboat) by the number of people attending and add in your 1/3 of your parents\u2019 portion. The siblings can then have exactly the amount they want to charge for their kids or choose to gift the trip to their kids, but you are under no obligation to bend to your siblings\u2019 shenanigans.", "NTA\n\nSplitting the cost of your parents share makes sense. Subsidizing your nieces and nephews does not.", "NTA\n\nIf you evenly split by each person, you'd pay way less. Paying by the room is the smart way and paying a portion of your parents works. They are trying to get over by having you fund their vacation", "This looks like a good hill to die on.\n\nNtA. \n\nThey can't afford it so they're making you carry to load. It's not worth it.", "NTA-you shouldn't have to pay for other families.", "NTA, aren't they the ones being cheap if they aren't paying their fair share?  I wouldn't pay 3 way when you aren't even taking up a 10th.", "This is a celebration\u2026 not meant to be a burden on any person. Using you to subsidize other adults isn\u2019t fair.

Try to think of the size accommodation you'd want if it was just your parents, your siblings, and their partners -- meaning just 8 people.  That's the place you should go 1/3 from.  Then add a healthy percentage to that number to keep the peace.  My guess is that this number is a bit higher than the number you came up with. I'm guessing 3k'ish would be fair.

Shit like this really annoys me, it's like the one who eats and drinks the most at a meal is always the one who wants to split the bill and moans about people who don't being cheap.

There are other adults joining the trip, doesn't matter of which generation.

You don't need to subsidize other working age adults.", "If your calculations are based only on the adults - NTA", "NTA.\n\nAlso, they'll probably try to give you the shittiest room, because \"you don't need the space, since you don't have kids.\"  Don't let them get away with that, especially if you pay anything more than your fair share.", "NTA.

That current plan is absurdly unfair.", "YTA, the way your brother and sister see it, the whole $16,000 trip is for your parents and your parents are deciding who to invite. So a three-way split is fair because the children are gifting this whole trip. If this was a family vacation, it would be fair for pay for your room and 1/3 of parents' bill. You got swindle by your silbings.", "I'll bring that up.  They will hate it.", "Even if I paid for my parents completely by myself it would only be $3,200.", "She farts a lot.

That\u2019s between you and them.\u201d That seems fair.\n\nThere is another consideration besides just fairness. You could prioritize giving your parents the best trip for them. If this dispute is going to tank the trip, or if someone\u2019s going to end up staying home, you could just suck it up for their sake so they\u2019ll get a perfect celebration.", "All the maths you have done makes complete sense.
