Of course they are all accusing you of being cheap and unfair - they are all pissed that you're not allowing them to use you to fund their vacation.  Their math is only good for them and not even remotely \"fair\" to you.", "NTA, of course your sibs say it's not fair when you aren't agreeing to subsidize their vacation. \n\nSplit by the number of people is the fairest way to split the cost.", "So\u2026they want you to subsidize their trip.\n\nNTA \n\nIf they won\u2019t agree to your contribution, offer to do something special alone with your pare At the end. Maybe meet up and have something planned there or on the way home. Go all out and it\u2019ll still be less than the trip.", "NTA. That\u2019s completely fair. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay for their families which is essentially what they are asking. Especially since you\u2019re all old enough to have grandchildren apparently. I personally wouldn\u2019t back down. Point out how many adults in each of your siblings families there is.", "You are way too be old to be posting something like this to reddit and asking for help tbh", "NTA\nFamily destination celebrations should be split evenly among ALL adults unless the parents WANT to cover their own adult children. \n\nMy childless brother and SIL only pay equal if none of the kids are coming. We split it by beds being used, so if I invite my 3 and my sister brings her 3, we pay more than my brother. We are the reason so much space is needed. \n\nHe splits the dinner bills evenly with everyone, taking some neice/nephew costs to be kind. \n\nI hate when big families expect childless couples to take on more cost because they don't have a \"family\" and more disposable income.", "NTA", "NTA when I read the title I thought, \u201cLet me guess. A group trip. Other people are bringing kids and OP is expected to subsidize them.\u201d Yep. All too typical, unfortunately.", "NTA. That\u2019s a crazy demand. I\u2019d explore splitting it by bedrooms.", "NTA.  Fuck that noise.", "NTA, that is not fair that they would be getting a HUGE discount if you paid for a third, when you are 2 out of the 28 going. I would maybe pay for you and the parents, and everyone else pays their part for themselves... but that is if you want to be nice. \n\nYour siblings are highly in the wrong to expect you to cover half of their family to go too.", "NTA. Paying proportionate to use is perfectly fair.", "Pay by person. Sounds like they are taking advantage you big time!\n\nTell them you're gifting your parents a cruise or trip to Vegas and not financing their family and kids and extended families and friend's vacation this year.", "Why don\u2019t you be super generous and cover yours and parents room. Like $2500? How could they complain at that. Rule should be that all adults split the cost. If a sub wants to pay their adult kids shares that\u2019s on them.", "NTA, stand strong \ud83d\udcaa", "NTA, also sounds a bit like the parents milestone celebration is not the key ingredient in this houseboat plan. These assholes planned something that fit THEIR agenda and invited a ton of extras. Your parents will be plowed right into the background yet they\u2019ll still feel obligated to seem grateful. They\u2019ll probably get back from this trip needing another vacation to recharge/re-set.", "NTA. Your siblings are expecting you to pay for THEIR grown up children and grandchildren. Insane! \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, and honestly if any of your siblings kids are 22 or over they should be paying for themselves", "NTA. In any shared accomodation you pay per room.", "NTA they are bringing adult kids who should pay for themselves, just mad. Do you honestly think k this vacation will go well now? Better off taking your parents separately", "And, it sounds like a total nightmare. Ask your parents if they want to sleep on boat beds for a week and to be trapped with screaming kids and fighting adult siblings for a week at their age.\n\nRent a ballroom and cater a snack table for THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS to dance not your siblings.", "Nta. They are obviously trying to financially abuse you. Good for you for understanding that you are not responsible for paying for everyone\u2019s vacation.", "NAH. Two ways of looking at it. Each individual, including children, can split the cost of your parents anniversary party\u2026\u2026\u2026or their three children can pay for the parents anniversary party. You have the money to do it, but maybe you only have the means to do it because you\u2019re frugal?", ">  My siblings think I'm being cheap and unfair\n\nOf course they do because they would benefit from the proposed arrangement.  NTA", "All these adult children can pay their own way or not go and the paying adults can get a more affordable houseboat. What you\u2019re planning to offer at $2000 is more than generous. \n\nJust because you have the means, doesn\u2019t make anyone else entitled to it and it sounds like they all feel they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYou should be paying by the room. Why would you pay so much to accommodate other people's kids?", "Your siblings are taking the piss.    For holidays, you pay your share. Which is for who you are bringing, and of course, your parent 3 ways.   You shouldn\u2019t be paying for all their tag alongs.   \n\nIt\u2018s not like a few hundred bugs and rounding up, it\u2019s over 3 times as much.\n\nAsk them why you are expected to pay for your nephews and nieces partners?", "Are there enough rooms for all the people they are inviting, you and your parents?  Will you be expected to be in a less desirable room 'for the kids'?\n\nThere are at *least* 20 adults listed above ('her children' could mean more, i used 2).  If there are more than 8 total kids, you (collectively) are over capacity.  Who are they going to expect to separate off?  (Hint not the kids).\n\nNope, should be funded per person (with celebrating parents being paid for by their kids).  You should not be paying for their vacation.", "NTA Every adult/couple needs to pay for themselves and their kids. You shouldn't be covering the cost of that many people. That's ridiculous.", "NTA", "NTA. Of course they want to split the bill equally. They only stand to save. Any adult should be expected to pay for themselves. They really shouldn\u2019t expect you to pay to cover their kids. They chose to have them, it\u2019s up to them to cover their cost.", "NTA. Divide 16,000 by the number of people going to get a per person number. You and your partner pay this x 2. Then, split your parents 3 ways. So, your total is per person x 2 plus 1/3 of parents' cost. The rest pay according to how many are in their party plus 1/3 of parents'.", "NTA\n\nSo they want you and your husband to pay a large portion of the cost for their extended family? \n\nSorry, that's like going out to dinner,  you ordering a salad while they order lobster and filet mignon with two bottles of wine and expect you to split it evenly. \n\nBULLSHIT.", "Tell them they either accept your offer or you back out and they can find their own way to pay for it and you\u2019ll do something like you said Vegas for your parents on your own.", "NTA... clearly!", "NTA\n\nThis in a nutshell", "I would flat out ask them how it's \"fair\" if they are literally using 5 times the amount of resources that I am.", "This is the way. Going just per room of this boat won\u2019t be exactly fair. It is likely 1/3 of the 8 person boat i would be more than the cost of your room on this larger boat.", "My brother has a very well behaved Broholmer. He\u2019s a good boy, but his farts are ungodly. We\u2019ve learned that if he suddenly gets up from his cot and goes to lie down at the other end of the room, it\u2019s best to follow him.", "I wouldnt. I like your. My room and 1/3 of parents.  You have NO obligation to pay for your nieces/nephews/great nieces and nephews.  If they do not want tobpay their free share THEN come up with smaller boat with 4 rooms or new trip idea for only parents and their kids/spouses.  No other generation", "NTA That\u2019s what I was thinking it had to be the brother or sister. \n\nHonestly op\u2019s brother and sister want a free trip for their families and expect op to just go along with it. That\u2019s ridiculous. I would not pay.", "That is what OP is requesting, that he/she pay for their own room and 1/3 of parents' room. I think. NTA.", " They aren't your kids.\n\nNTA", "I understand the snub.", "Oh nooo even he moves away from himself", "That\u2019s what makes sense provided that any unused rooms are split three ways if they don\u2019t need a boat of this size. For example if they needed 14 rooms but could only find a good boat with 15 rooms, that last room is split.", "I never said they were.  I\u2019m talking about the pro rata cost of each room being occupied  calculated for each of the 3 siblings (after the parents room is split 3 ways) and then it\u2019s up to each sibling to decide how to fund their family\u2019s portion.", "Right - that's why Ambifhj is saying you are NTA - as they aren't your kids.", "A few problems with what you\u2019ve said though:\n\n1) Besides the parents + 2 siblings and partners + OP and partner, there would be at least 12 other adults going (not including the 5+ children). That is subsidizing a LOT of people.\n\n2) It\u2019s easy to be generous with someone else\u2019s money- the siblings are doing it, you\u2019re doing it. An assumption was made that those 16 adults (siblings + spouses + adult children) do not have the financial resources to be able to pay- OP does not say that in the post.\n\n3) Why does the holiday have to be a houseboat? The siblings are planning this- why didn\u2019t they plan for a holiday they would actually spend money on? Since it\u2019s about the parents, what matters is spending time together- so why did the siblings choose something they knew they didn\u2019t want to pay full price for themselves or their kids or grandkids? Why did they decide to play Oprah (you get a holiday and you get a holiday, everyone gets a holiday!!) with OP\u2019s money?\n\n4) Suppose OP does give in and eventually pays- again, I ask, at this point, do you honestly think those entitled siblings, who knowingly chose an expensive holiday and expected OP to subsidize at least 12 adults and 5+ kids, are *not* going to be making comments or jabs the five days that everyone is trapped on a boat together? That there won\u2019t still be drama because of this?"]}
