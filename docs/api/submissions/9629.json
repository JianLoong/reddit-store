It's obvious the rest of the family can't afford it. Maybe have the group rent an AirBnB for three days, and then rent a boat for a few hours at the beginning and at the end of those three days.\n\nWith so many people and so many kids, the bathrooms won't be usable after a few hours, let alone after 5 days.\n\nWhatever the case, she needs an escape plan if these family members continue to be AH during the actual trip. That escape plan can either involve another boat (a tiny one), an hotel room, a rental car, or an Uber ride.", "Have you tried daily dollops of yogurt? That worked for our fart princess (and I didn't give her yogurt with that effect in mind, it was merely to give her a medical powder).", "Yeah it wouldn't really work anyway even if they kept their word and piled up into two rooms.. because there'll be a bunch of empty rooms that someone has to pay for anyway", "Also, the siblings are not just bringing a their own underaged kids. They are bringing their grown-up kids and their partners and kids, so several grown-up people who could actually pay for themselves.", "Good point, and Happy Cake Day!", "HAHA omg my little toy poodle NEVER farts and last night he'd been glued to my lap for over an hour nap-trapping me. Suddenly gets up and goes all the way to the other end of the couch.   \n\n\nI soon realised why, I had to get up and make a draught and stand on the balcony til it passed. He had too much plain chicken, protein fart :|", "TIL i might be a broholmer", "Brilliant! Honestly, the amount of things I learn from Reddit\u2026", "Agreed. It\u2019s virtually carved into the fine print in many families that the \u201crich\u201d relative will subsidize the poor ones while also making it appear as if everyone is paying their own way. \n\nNTA for declining that invitation.", "Yeah I'd cover the cost to the parents to be honest.. not out of obligation, just as a gesture.. it's still subsidizing my siblings share of the present, but also as someone without kids I'm conscious that my expenses are a lot lower and I'm doing it as a gesture of good will to keep the peace and so that nobody can accuse me of not being fair.. if it's rejected by the siblings because they're trying to mooch, then you can walk away knowing you went above and beyond.. also noone can accuse you of not doing it for your parents if you're offering to cover the parents expenses..  NTA either way of course.. but I hate how compromise is vilified by Western culture, like noone is telling OP he should pay more but the mere suggestion of it as an option is downvoted to shit", "Is $16,000 chump change for you? If so, maybe they\u2019re actually right in a way. Life may have handed you and them different circumstances and they are wanting you to be generous so the family can enjoy this moment all together. It is a myth that hard work alone makes a man rich. However if this cost would strain your finances in any way you are definitely NTA.", "NTA - they are trying to get you to pay for their clan", "They're not doing this for your parents. They're doing it for themselves.", "NTA - cost be should be divided per head, with everyone covering the cost of your parents.", "NTA \nYou\u2019re siblings are just trying to get you to out for their families AND their partners. That\u2019s absurd", "NTA, you are being fair.", "NTA. They are taking advantage of you", "NTA. They are pissed because they want a subsidised holiday. It\u2019s not fair to expect you to pay so much when you aren\u2019t bringing additional guests", "When we do trips like this we split by adult ie over 18 and working. We usually then pay for our adult kids, but that\u2019s our choice.", "NTA\n\nYour family is being completely unreasonable. I would never agree to split it 3 ways.", "There is a very easy solution.\n\nThere are 28 places, but 2 people, OP's parents, aren't paying at all. So there are 26 spaces.\n\n$16000 / 26 = $616 per space.\n\nEveryone pays for how many spaces they need.", "Yeah, I actually say there's not enough info.  If there's ready availability of a smaller boat like this then NTA. But if 28-person is the smallest size, OP should pay a larger share because they'd have to get that boat regardless of how many people came along.  I suspect that, as you suppose, smaller boats are available. OP should pay a third of whatever the smallest boat suitable for OPs needs is.", "Or- you make more money so it\u2019s ok if you pay more.", "Sounds like hell \u2026 5 days of anywhere locked down with all that family! Booze, and lots of it, would need to be included. Is there anything wrong with a long weekend at a hotel or BnB? Still costs less.\n\nNTA: OP pays for his & 1/3rd of the partners - no more \u2026 because if it was a large dinner gathering, the split would be the same: I pay for me & 1/3rd of the parents. You want to invite extras - that\u2019s on your dime"]}
