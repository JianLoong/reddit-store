It takes some math and planning but it's the right way to make it fair for each person's family situation.", "I read it.  They are doing something for **their** parents.  If they don't want to participate then don't.  But don't come off like they are renting rooms when they are renting a boat for their parents.\n\nif they don't like the way it's split then change what they do.", "Sounds like the siblings are trying to take advantage of OP.  \n\nI hate when people do that and then whine \"but we're faamily\"  as the excuse for it.", "> The whole family being there IS THE GIFT.\n\nIf the nieces and nephews are old enough to have their own kids then they should be able to contribute SOMETHING to pay their way as well.  \n\nThe question should at least be brought up and maybe work something out with the older siblings if there's a shortfall.", "Obviously there are a lot of adults who do not want to share the gift, so why would OP pay for a gift like that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHey can get their parents a BETTER gift form them for less money, instead of sharing a gift with leeches.", "Okay think of it like this.  \nits not a boathouse but a trip somewhere like a cruise for 5 days  \nTicket for each person is $500+extra  \nOP: 2 tickets + 1/3 parents is $2000  \nSister: a pack of 10 people + 1/3 parents is 7000  \nBrother: a pack of 10 people + 1/3 parents is 7000  \n\n\nSister and brother wants to offset their cost by throwing it onto OP  \nHey man lets do this evenly everyone 5300  \n\n\nwe bring more people so we pay less per person  \nyou OP have less people so should pay more per person  \n\n\nMaybe they don't bring extended + family like their spouses parents... to double dip on idk the main PARENTS anniversary  \n\n\nThey are just cheapos only trying to get a bigger slice of the cake (pay less) and have OP get a sliver (pay more)", "Then let the siblings bringing all the extra \"gifts\" pay for them and get their due portion of appreciation. The idea that one sibling should have to subsidize all the grandchildren and some of their *partners* is ridiculous.", "I am very surprised I haven't seen other comments noticing this.\n\nThe gift to the anniversary couple is their entire family together to celebrate them, not just the parents getting a room on a boat. All their descendents being there for them is the gift! \n\n(Even I, the only childless member of my generation, understands this)", "Yes, actually, I do.", "What else would you call a request for the OP to pay for multiple children and their partners? I'm not saying they are double-charging, but they clearly have an exploitative mindset.", "Except $16k for a week is pretty cheap for a yacht rental.", "Maybe it is more like a yacht.\n\nI'm from the UK and houseboat to me is a canal boat but I don't know much about the types of boats so could totally be a misunderstanding on my end. \n\nWhat I'm imagining, a longboat/houseboat/canalboat sounds like actual hell with that many people", "They are renting a boat with their whole family, which includes adult children and their children. Why wouldn\u2019t the adult grandchildren pitch in for this gift?\n\nIt makes no sense to split it only 3 ways. They *are* renting rooms, since the boat has enough rooms for each adult and their associated family unit. If they want to split it 3 ways, rent can boat  that will only accommodate themselves, their partners, and their parents. Leave the freeloaders on shore.", "It's not a family vacation though. It's a gift for the parents and the gift is the whole family being there. If OP can't afford it that's fine. \n\nIf you think of it as a family portrait, that the three kids are going thirds in, and OP is haggling that his family is only two people in the portrait so he wants to pay 2/30ths. That's how silly it is. \n\nIf this was a regular family vacation, then yes everyone pays for themselves and if you can't pay you just don't go. It's not though. It's a gift the other kids have asked OP if he wants to go thirds in, and the gift is that OPs elderly parents get their whole family together. That won't happen if it's a pay your own way vacation. \n\nIf it's not a gift that OP wants to buy, that's fine. But the haggling to pay less is really silly.", "I've been watching Below Deck and $16k is considered a low amount for the tip they get for a 3 day rental.", "Not to be contrary- but they would not need 14 rooms, but for the extra guests- so those bringing extra can cover the extra room.", "But why shouldn't the parents of the children and grandchildren pay for their broods themselves?  They're getting this hotsy totsy vacation with their own families as well, and basking in the gratitude of their kids. Honestly, expecting the childless sib to underwrite the splurges the other two will get credit for is one heck of a grift.", "But why don't the extra adults pay in.\n\nI don't think it's comparable to a photo as photos are charged per number of copies + time not per person in the photo.\n\nAs someone else said it's like going out for a meal. But a couple of people brought 10friends along each and still only expect to split the cost 3 ways. That doesn't even make sense. \n\nYes it's lovely to get the family together but it's not on OP to pay for other family members adult children to facilitate that and that doesn't make them an AH for thinking it's unreasonable because it is unreasonable.\n\nThe bro and sis want to bring their kids and grandkids, lovely so they should pay for those or their kids should chip in. Why is it on OP to make sure the whole fam is together for this gift when there are 2 other adults with their adult child fully capable (I assume) of paying into this gift. Because their adult children aren't paying so is it also a gift for them... Yeah kinda. \n\nThey shouldn't have expected OP to pay 1/3 of total cost if THEY can't afford their fair portion of the gift. Having a family = higher costs.", "1. I wouldn\u2019t do it for the 12 other adults plus children. I\u2019d do it for the parents.\n\n2. Correct - I assume that money is easier for OP than for everyone who\u2019s got kids and grandkids to worry about. I could be wrong.\n\n3. Sure, someone could have come up with a cheaper plan.\n\n4. Who the hell knows? But I think there\u2019s a better shot at no drama if OP makes a gesture. I think covering the parents\u2019 cost is an elegant way to do it. It\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019d do.\n\nIf the siblings are more financially comfortable than OP, or if they\u2019re drama queens who\u2019ll grouse the whole trip if they\u2019re not placated somehow, then yeah, that would change the equation. If either of those were true, I\u2019d be less interested in making a gesture.\n\nIn any case, OP is NTA."]}
