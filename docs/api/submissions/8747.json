I won't do that, its hard to explain altough i don't hate him the trauma is to much for me to handle. \n\nI talked with my brother, he told me he fought with our dad because he believed what our father did to me was unforgetable and my brother blames our father for never having a brother. \n\nI told him that i will always going to be his brother no matter what and that our father has learned from his mistakes. My brother asked then why didn't i forgave him and told him what i wrote here. \n\nThey are talking again so overall this went better than what i expected", "created_utc": 1675147361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pr2fy/updateaita_for_telling_my_brother_why_i_dont_talk/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Thank you for the update.  Generous of you to acknowledge your father has learned.  I can only imagine how bad the trauma must still be.", "It sounds like everything is going about as well for everybody involved as it realistically can go. \n\nYour relationship with your father remains... pretty much what you want it to be, which is out of contact. This is totally fair, and completely up to you. \n\nYour relationship with your brother sounds like it's pretty solid, and staying that way. \n\nYour brother's relationship with his (and your) father is, understandably, impacted by what he has learned, but hopefully not wrecked by it... for your brother's sake, if not necessarily your father's. \n\nKudos to you and your brother, both of whom it sounds like handled the whole thing pretty darn well! Maybe to your father too, if he handled his end of it responsibly based on his more recent understanding of what he had done wrong in the first place. (None of which means I think you're under any obligation to forgive him or reconnect with him. That still and always remains up to you.) \n\nThanks for telling us the latest!", "I'm just happy to hear you still have a good relationship with your brother.\n\nYour father was the AH, and might still be, but we can't judge that here and now.\n\nHope for the best for you both.", "My heart goes out to you OP. \nINFO: how old were you when your brother was born? What\u2019s the age gap? He mentioned not having a brother so was he too young/baby when you hit 18 and left?", "NTA but honestly I would write your dad a letter saying you don\u2019t hate him, but you are doing well without him and will continue to do so . Have a nice life. Bye", "Thank you so much!", "I was 16 when he was born.\n\nSince my parents my divorced, i would spend a weekend a month with my dad so from 16-18 i saw him sometimes.", "I wish you all the best and remember you did nothing wrong", "I think what you did was fair, told you brother the truth but also told him that this shouldn\u2019t effect his and dad relationship. Your brother was nice in this case, he didn\u2019t have to care cause your dad treated him differently but he cares for you. \n\nFor me, I believe you can maintain good relationship with your brother without your dad in the picture. Too bad that you missed out on each other childhood but you\u2019ve many years ahead, not so bad.", "YTA ESH"]}
