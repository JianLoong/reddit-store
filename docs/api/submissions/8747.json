I won't do that, its hard to explain altough i don't hate him the trauma is to much for me to handle. \n\nI talked with my brother, he told me he fought with our dad because he believed what our father did to me was unforgetable and my brother blames our father for never having a brother. \n\nI told him that i will always going to be his brother no matter what and that our father has learned from his mistakes. My brother asked then why didn't i forgave him and told him what i wrote here. \n\nThey are talking again so overall this went better than what i expected", "created_utc": 1675147361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pr2fy/updateaita_for_telling_my_brother_why_i_dont_talk/", "score": 1079, "replies": ["Thank you for the update.  Generous of you to acknowledge your father has learned.  I can only imagine how bad the trauma must still be.", "It sounds like everything is going about as well for everybody involved as it realistically can go. \n\nYour relationship with your father remains... pretty much what you want it to be, which is out of contact. This is totally fair, and completely up to you. \n\nYour relationship with your brother sounds like it's pretty solid, and staying that way. \n\nYour brother's relationship with his (and your) father is, understandably, impacted by what he has learned, but hopefully not wrecked by it... for your brother's sake, if not necessarily your father's. \n\nKudos to you and your brother, both of whom it sounds like handled the whole thing pretty darn well! Maybe to your father too, if he handled his end of it responsibly based on his more recent understanding of what he had done wrong in the first place. (None of which means I think you're under any obligation to forgive him or reconnect with him. That still and always remains up to you.) \n\nThanks for telling us the latest!", "I'm just happy to hear you still have a good relationship with your brother.\n\nYour father was the AH, and might still be, but we can't judge that here and now.\n\nHope for the best for you both.", "My heart goes out to you OP. \nINFO: how old were you when your brother was born? What\u2019s the age gap? He mentioned not having a brother so was he too young/baby when you hit 18 and left?", "NTA but honestly I would write your dad a letter saying you don\u2019t hate him, but you are doing well without him and will continue to do so . Have a nice life. Bye", "Thank you so much!", "I was 16 when he was born.\n\nSince my parents my divorced, i would spend a weekend a month with my dad so from 16-18 i saw him sometimes.", "I wish you all the best and remember you did nothing wrong", "I think what you did was fair, told you brother the truth but also told him that this shouldn\u2019t effect his and dad relationship. Your brother was nice in this case, he didn\u2019t have to care cause your dad treated him differently but he cares for you. \n\nFor me, I believe you can maintain good relationship with your brother without your dad in the picture. Too bad that you missed out on each other childhood but you\u2019ve many years ahead, not so bad.", "YTA ESH", "I\u2019m sorry about your childhood. \n\nFrom my perspective, you handled this very well. \n\n\nSounds like your brother is a great guy, glad you two reconnected!", "I have something similar with my father. What I tell myself is that it\u2019s good when people change and grow. Even though it hurts to see him be the perfect Dad with his new family\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t want to be speaking with someone who would repeat make the same old mistakes with his new family.", "So much love. It's how I feel when I think about my trauma too. So much misguided hurtful toxic bad love.\n\nYour father learnt not to see a child as a complete extension of himself, stopped being a bully sadist, finaly accpeted his failures, and let your brother exist on his own and in his love. He managed to change so much bc I imagine losing you and losing her broke him enough to change that part of his core. He loves you bc he feels the shame and bc your brother wouldn't love you so much if it didn't came from a father too.\n\nYour brother aches for you all this time and loves you so much even though he didn't know you throughout his life, that he was willing to break his relationship with his dad to get justice for you.\n\nYour mom loved you so so much that she saved you from a toxic father whom she, I imagined, loved very much, she married the bloke.\n\nKudos to your mom, everyone would be in an unimaginably worse position, and so much more damaged and hurt, if she didn't take you and left.\n\nI love thinking about love through my trauma bc it helps me let some of the glass from my heart go. Knowing they gave me all they could in that moment even though it was rotten and poisoned me is much healthier for me than believing all that hurt came from evil. I feel better knowing they are better now bc hope in humanity.", "I'm sorry people are pushing you to reconnect with an abuser. That's abuse in and of itself and you don't deserve that. Hold your ground that helps you heal.", "NTA", "NTA", "Yes, great update.  I get not wanting to reconnect with your father and support your decision to separate yourself.   You are being very generous by encouraging your brother to maintain and enjoy his relationship with dad.\n\nI can't imagine how hard it must be for you to sit on the sidelines and watch him be the father he should have been to you.", "Why", "I was already voted NTA.", "Those are two separate judgements and that's not even what this post is for.  Are you lost?", "You know those are two contradictory votes? And that you don't vote on update posts?", "Because they're imagining life as a Hallmark movie and think it'll do something.", "Thanks for the update- you are fine to have boundaries. I know people will claim \u201cthey are family \u201c\u2026 yeah well, toxic is still toxic.\n\nI\u2019m glad your dad learned how to be a better dad to your brother- no one should endure what you did.  You dad feels bad- but the damage was done and there isn\u2019t much he can do to make up for it. \n\nContinue to be the awesome big bro and do what you need to continue healing", "I think that you have great capacity for self-reflection, and are navigating this honestly. This is new territory for all of you, and it sounds like you are doing the best you can to have compassion while still protecting yourself. \n\n>I told him that i will always going to be his brother no matter what and that our father has learned from his mistakes. My brother asked then why didn't i forgave him and told him what i wrote here.\n\n>They are talking again so overall this went better than what i expected\n\nThis is a great outcome. You have a big heart. Thank you for the update.", "Keep no contact he doesn\u2019t deserve a good son such as yourself I would have been proud of the grades I was proud of my daughter and still am", "I'm glad this conclusion ended this way. It's probably for the best, considering what you went through. I hope you're doing much better now!", "Bless you. As someone who's been through childhood trauma/abuse, sending you lots of love x", "I\u2019m glad you were able to talk to your brother about it.", "No matter what anyone tells you, you are the one who knows what's best for you, and it's very easy for others to tell you to forgive and forget, but it's your choice to make, not theirs.\n\nI'm glad that you and your brother have developed a relationship.  You don't owe your dad anything.  I will also add that he could approach you, this isn't all on you.\n\nBest of luck.", "NTA, sounds like your dad realized he fucked up with you and tried to do better with your brother. While that's still hard for you at least your brother can have the father you always needed", "Your father pushing you to do well in school is not \"trauma.\" You're seriously still mad at him for this two decades later?\n\nYTA.", "I\u2019m not going to say you should or should not reconcile with your father. I would though suggest counseling so that you can come to terms with the past and heal from it.", "I'm glad that you and your brother have developed a relationship.", "I also think maintaining distance is wise. \n\nI can't help but notice that OP mentions his father hung his head in shame but never tried to apologise.\nLikewise, when OP's brother confronted their father (rightfully so or not), the father's reaction lead to a fight. That doesn't sound to me like a humble acknowledgement of past mistakes, you know?\n\nI say well done to you, OP", ">Your father pushing you to do well in school is not \"trauma.\"\n\nYou're right. \n\nHe screaming at me when i had mid to high 80s of 100 is trauma.\n\nHe screaming at me that i was going to be a failure is trauma.\n\nHe fighting with my mom saying she was being \"to weak\" on me was trauma.\n\nHe putting an immeasurable ammount of stress on me to the point i am still a perfeccionist and still have a bit of ansienty whenever i mess up no matter how litle was trauma.", "The only person that gets to decide what is or isn't trauma is the person who was traumatized. My father still doesn't believe that choking me was traumatic.", "I was in therapy from age 12 to 22. I am better and in most days i don't think about him.", "> The only person that gets to decide what is or isn't trauma is the person who was traumatized.\n\nThat\u2019s not what trauma means. There\u2019s an objective works out there, and words mean things.", "Damn! Who knew years of abuse could be solved with just a dictionary?! \n\nYou're deflecting the point like many abusers do. \n\nAnything can be abusive and or traumatic if done in an abusive way. \n\nFeeding a kid Mac and cheese isn't traumatic but if you force feed them full pan after pan until they've thrown up five times as a method of discipline, then yes. You have successfully turned Mac and cheese into a traumatic trigger. \n\nSame with school. Going nuts on a kid that gets a B+ doesn't do anything but teach them anxiety and that they NEED to get something 100% on the first try. Which is a piss poor outlook on life that can be very damaging."]}
