Your newborn's health comes before ANYONE else's feelings or wants. \n\nHowever, I am going to advise you to be cautious about your SIL. Not just because of the recidivism rate but because she is refusing to accept responsibility and accountability for her actions. You have every reason to not want her around your baby.

Illnesses/symptoms are compounded in newborns\nand young children with weakened immune systems and/or other health conditions (including preterm birth).\n\nThe doctors are absolutely right.\nRegardless of anyone else\u2019s feelings, your daughter needs you to do right by her.

That\u2019s still a difficult time for someone dealing with mental health issues. They\u2019ve still got things to work on. The fact that Annie is blaming you and calling you an asshole instead of considering that a) you\u2019re telling the truth that you\u2019re limiting who comes near your brand new baby, and b) maybe her resentment is a signal she needs to contact her sponsor again ASAP, shows that she needs to get on her rehab work, talk to her doctor/sponsor/therapist, and stop taking this out on you.

Two months out of rehab is not a long time and relapse is part of the recovery journey. This is probably not going to be linear for Annie, there will be steps forward and steps backward and part of getting healthy will be rolling with those things.
