The house stinks and I don\u2019t invite her over anymore because the last time I did the stink from her clothes got on my couch and chair and it took a deep cleaning to get it out.

They created a file and will send an officer out to investigate. Thanks for all the answers everyone!\n\nEdit: A Kick-me dog is just a tiny dog. I don't kick dogs, nor do I condone it, it's just a funny name I heard from someone who had a small Pomeranian for tiny dogs. Can we just calm down about the joke name for tiny dogs?

Is the house full of cats and the small dog creating an unsanitary environment that would out the humans at risk for diseases as well?", "NTA, call whoever you can to get that dog out of an abusive home. It's straight up illegal now in some places to just leave a dog chained up outside.\n\nAlso, 4 cats is iffy, depending on living situations, but since they're clearly not all spayed/neutered, what with the 5 kittens now, they've got the makings of a catsplosion on their hands. Also, if they haven't spay/neutered, then odds are those animals don't get regular vet visits. The kitten might be lucky if they're given to a good home. Given the \"love\" of animals I wouldn't be concerned with kitten-killing as a possibility, but if they stay in that home they will be breeding with each other within 6 months and that is how you get massive cat-hoarding situations.\n\nI volunteer for a cat rescue and those situations can get very bad, very fast.\n\nEdit: born in Dec? Technically, one could be pregnant already.", "NTA. Make the call. It sounds like animal neglect, and these animals deserve better. Large dogs aren\u2019t meant to be on chains all day with little room to exercise. 2 litter boxes for 9 cats sounds incredibly unhygienic, no wonder there is a smell in the house and on their clothes.", " NTA please do help this family", "NTA, it's not healthy not for them, not for the animals to live together in that numbers in such a small space. And I get the part of the nasty smell, having so many cats, I can only imagine the obnoxious smell of the litter boxes impregnating all over the trailer and in their clothes.", "NTA.\nShe\u2019s not \u03b1 responsible pet owner.\nAre you assured she won\u2019t figure out who called animal control?\nAnd if she does find out, will you care if she\u2019s no longer your friend?", "NTA, please call them!!!", "Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\n\nThey need help for the sake of the animals, but I can't pass judgement.", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s the right thing to do, but I just hope you\u2019re aware that these animals probably bring a lot of comfort and joy to their lives when the world is very harsh on disabled people. Whether they stink or not, if you\u2019re going to take the animals away, you have a duty to give them your company.", "I would really think about calling animal control. You may think the animals aren't being super duper cared for but having them taken to the pound is a death sentence.", "NTA- I understand it's a sensitive topic, and by the wording, it sounds unintentional in that they may not fully comprehend the responsibilities of having pets. With that being said, it's not a good or safe environment for neither the people nor the animals and would be best for all parties if you contacted Animal control. At the very least, they will be on the radar for things down the road, should something arise.", "YWNBTA. \n\nIf animal control finds anything wrong with the situation, that\u2019s on them for not properly caring for their pets. They can\u2019t blame you for their own neglectful behaviour. \n\nIt sounds like an awful quality of life for their poor dog and having 9 cats is veering into a hoarding situation. I highly doubt those litter boxes are being cleaned daily if they\u2019re not even walking their dogs. Reporting them would be a kindness to these animals who can\u2019t speak for themselves.", "NTA, that's an abusive unhealthy living situation for all of them including the kid still in school. If she smells like that poor kid probably does too and probably is bullied for it. Poor kid and poor poor animals. It sucks having to report friends. But abuse is abuse and no one should be forced to live like that no matter how close we are to them.", "Please call.", "NTA - it should be considered a privilege to have a pet. These people definitely shouldn\u2019t have any", "Please help out those poor animals. No pet dezerves neglect and shpddy care. Also, the situation being what it is, the pets probably haven't seen a vet in a while, so they cluld use a good medical checkup and someone who wiil give them the things they need to live THEIR best life. I don't understand people who get pets only to ignore, neglect and fail to socialize them. Just DON'T GET THE PET if you lack the time, finances, knowledge, and love to CARE for the pet properly!", "NTA please help the animals! Thank you for thinking of them.", "NTA. Do please call. I don't know about your area, but here Animal Control keeps the reporters private.", "Call animal control. When one take in an animal or more one needs to take really good care of it. Being on a chain and having that many cats with only two litter boxes is not taking care of it at all. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Those poor animals need rescuing.", "NTA seems like they are hoarding animals they can't take care of physically", "NTA.\n\nYWBTA if you let those animals stay there.\n\nI have a dog and 2 cats, I couldn\u2019t imagine giving them anything less than a great life. Not good. Great. There needs to be more than two litter boxes\u2014 in fact, every cat should have their own litter box.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford pets, you shouldn\u2019t own them. OP, you\u2019d be doing the right thing. Even if they were at a shelter for too long and had to be put down, at least you know that they\u2019d have been taken out of the awful situation they were in and had people to take care of them.\n\nI think, if you\u2019re really worried, it could be a good idea to talk to your friend and tell her that you\u2019re truly concerned and are thinking of getting help for her animals. Of course, though, I don\u2019t know your friendship with her\u2014 she might be the type to ghost you should you even bring this up. I don\u2019t know.\n\nDo what\u2019s best for these animals, and best of luck OP!!!", "NTA call them now", "If you ever think an animal or someone is suffering, you should always make the call. The appropriate services will then make the call on what level of intervention, if any is needed. It may be a waste of their time and nothing happens, or it may just save the animals from suffering.\nI've always believed, if you feel like a call needs to be made, and you don't do it, then you're complicit.", "I'm late to the party but NTA . animal control can look at the situation dispassionately and do what's best for the animals", "I don't know what kind of dog it is. I just say Kick-me dogs to account for all tiny dogs. I'm sorry to have offended you, but you shouldn't make assumptions of people based on what they call things. Have a good day.", "You described the big dog as large. Why could you not have called the small dog tiny?", "I don't know. I got the kick-me dog name from a dog owner and lover who had a tiny Pomeranian. She called it her kick-me dog. Why is this such a big deal?", "WTF is a \u201ckick-me\u201d dog????", "Because it sounds like you're okay with kicking it due to its size.", "Probably a chihuahua or similar small breed that op doesn\u2019t like", "NTA at allll. Call them. You\u2019re a good person.", "NTA- but at the same time if your friend found out, don't be surprised if she hates you.\n\nBeside, why are you still friend with her? Clearly you don't like her.", "NTA \n\nand I call them snack sized dogs but of course would never let my larger dog have one as a snack lol", "NTA for calling to report the animals. YTA for referring to the house dog as a \u201ckick-me\u201d dog. It may be obnoxious, etc., but if they are not taking care of their animals, what makes you think they are training them? Dogs are only as good as their owners train them to be.", "The animals will probably be euthanized due to over crowding. Do you think they're worse off than that?", "NTA but also what about the high school aged child? I\u2019m sad that this is his life as well.", "My Uncle\u2019s wife used to have small dogs all the time but he fished and hunted (not with the dogs) but he used to call them \u201cmuskie bait\u201d. He loved those little dogs. It was just his term for small useless dogs \ud83d\ude02", "So glad you made the call! Animals can't advocate for themselves so it's so important for us to do it on their behalf when they're being neglected (which they very obviously are) or abused!\n\nYou're NTA for doing what you did, you just potentially helped all of those sweet animals hopefully get better homes!", "Small, annoying, yappy dogs. The kind you just want to punt across the yard", "SMall dog close to the feet", "Oh get over it, it's just a joke. Most small dogs are yappy and annoying", "yeah not a fan of implying its cool to kick it just because you personally decided you dislike small dogs. sounds cruel to say that.", "It could also mean that because it's tiny it gets kicked because they often run under feet and that happens accidentally.", "Absolutely call.", "It's seems like your in Alberta. Call Environmental health not animal control. They don't see to be living healthy. Environmental health has more power  bc its not illegal to chain a dog as it has adequate shelter. \nNTA", "NTA - in no way shape or form are you the asshole. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CARING ABOUT THESE ANIMALS. Please please PLEASE continue to call animal control until something is done. These poor animals are going to live their entire life in poor quality if something isn\u2019t done. Yeah they may not be humans (not that that matters but I know some people feel they are better or more important than animals simply because they are a human) but they deserve to have a good life. Their life is already so so short. They shouldn\u2019t suffer simply because their humans are being selfish and bad owners. That\u2019s just not right.", "They updated this but I second it. I adopted twins who because of their previous home had several bad issues that we took care of except for the boy who impregnated his sister a few weeks before we could get them spayed/neutered and we almost had 5 additional cats. Unfortunately/fortunately only 2 made it when she gave birth with one sadly passing, but you can't have too many cats especially with so many not spayed neutered and without the proper amount of litter boxes. It's also unlikely they had enough space in the first place or the owners would send them to a humane society/non-profit organization that works with different companies to helps cats.", "Gotta admit I giggled when I read that knowing it's the small annoying yapyap breeds.", "That was my interpretation, I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally kicked my mother's chi when she visits, because that dog loves being right in front of you all the time when you walked."]}
