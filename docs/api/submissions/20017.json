{"id": 20017, "submission_id": "14cwjhi", "title": "AITA for asking my boyfriend to scuba dive again after he almost had a panic attack?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, the boyfriend is a bit angry with me at the minute and its got me wondering if I was in the wrong?\n\nMy boyfriend Josh (22M) and I (22F) booked ourselves in to do a scuba course in Tanzania. We started it a few days ago. It involves going through scuba theory where we were tested and we passed and the instructors brought us to the beach to give it a go today.\n\nI really enjoyed it. My boyfriend less so. We're both strong swimmers which is why we decided to try it. However, once my boyfriend got under the water, he started to panic. He immediately surfaced and said he felt like a panic attack was coming on and wanted to leave. He wanted to get out of the gear and sit on the beach to wait for us but I gently persuaded him to give it another go because I know he would regret it later if he didn't at least try and waste all the money he spent. He did give it another go but struggled and sat on the beach so the rest of us went back out and had a great time.\n\nI joined him after and explained how much fun it was and that we saw some fish. He was really happy for me so I asked him again if he wants to give it another go and he just shut me down. He said that me asking before made him feel like he couldn't say no and like he didn't give it a proper go. I argued that he didn't, he didn't even make it out into deeper water to put the things we learned to use. He maintains that he didn't want to have a panic attack in the deeper water and put us in danger and its not my place to say whether he tried properly or not because he thinks he did. \n\nWas I an asshole? I asked out of a good place because he looked so excited with the fish. I also don't think me asking him to try again was a big deal because he's done this with other similar adventure activities we've tried and always laments he regrets not fully committing to the activity.", "created_utc": 1687125725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cwjhi/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_scuba_dive_again/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't matter what other activities he regrets not fully committing to, we're talking about water. Deep water.\n\nI had a panic attack while snorkeling on my honeymoon. My husband and our guide got me out of the water as fast as they could and no one tried encouraging me to give it another go because money would be wasted. People DROWN during a panic attack.", "YTA, not for asking him to scuba dive again, but for later trying to argue that he \"didn't try hard enough\". He's right, it's not your place to say.\n\nYour boyfriend did a sensible thing. Him having a panic attack underwater could have put others in danger, not just himself. \n\nAlso I do get a small sense of you rubbing it in his face that you had a great time and he missed out.", "YTA - I am a DiveMaster of 29 years, a scuba diver of 33 years.\n\nANYONE can call the dive for ANY REASON! Back in 2006, my wife and I were on a Liveaboard dive boat, and prepping for the night dive. I jumped in the water, swam to the line, and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, one of the Boat DiveMaster's called me back onboard. My wife was too nervous for this dive, but had been unwilling to call it and thought that if I jumped first, she would have to follow through. Needless to say she didn't, and that WAS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE! I just wish she had said so earlier, I could have avoided another shower or found another buddy.\n\nI have decades of dive experience, well over a thousand dives, hundreds of hours logged (and unlogged), I have NO PROBLEMS ABORTING A DIVE if I am uncomfortable with it, whether that be prior to the dive, or once in the water.\n\nYou NEVER force a person beyond their comfort zone unless you wish to create problems that can result in injury or death. I have dealt with multiple panicked divers underwater and on the surface (that is part of being a DiveMaster). A goal is prevent that from ever happening so that I don't have to perform a rescue or a recovery. \n\nMy biggest joy in helping with Open Water classes is to help those who may have barely passed the class (or failed it) build their skills so that they pass with flying colors and enjoy diving. But part of that is recognizing discomfort early on and alleviating it, not forcing people through it.", "YTA. You were incredibly pushy and showed no consideration for how he felt.", "YTA\n\nJust think it through.\n\nYour boyfriend almost had a panic attack underwater, and you asked him to do the thing that almost gave him a panic attack again?\n\nHow is this even a wise decision?", "YTA\n\nHe had a panic attack in the water. You asked him to try again. He did and had another panic attack. Then you pushed him to try AGAIN. Why?\n\nLeave him the heck alone. He's an adult, not a child. Panic attacks are not a small thing. Don't try to control him.", "YTA because \"I argued that he didn't, he didn't even make it out into deeper water...\" \n\nYou were fine to ask if he wanted to go again the first time. But he panicked twice and it was smart of him to decline after that. You should have let it go then.\n\nSo tired of people thinking that people 'just aren't trying hard enough\" when they're literally PANICKING. Panic attacks are no joke. They can literally incapacitate you. Your bf could have DIED if he were hyperventilating/freezing in deep water wherein his body was not under his control and he was deep under water.", "Yes you were the asshole.  The same thing happened to me.  I'm a very strong swimmer,  on competitive teams, avid snorkelers.  On my checkout dives for certification I too had a panic attack.  You can't predict how you will react in open water \n\nPanic attacks are terrifying. You truly feel like you are dying and this is it.  Diving isn't for him.  Stop pressing him to do something that traumatized him.  Be a supportive girlfriend or he might wave goodbye to you for being an asshole.", "Info: Is this your very first time dealing with someone having a panic attack? I'm genuinely asking because you seem to not really get what that means. I'm hoping it's just lack of experience and not willful ignorance. \n\nPanic attacks are not logical or reasonable. You can have all the training in the world, be an absolute expert at diving, and still drown if you have a panic attack while under. Your boyfriend made the safest choice for both himself and the people around him.\n\nI get that sometimes he needs a little encouragement to try new, adventurous things, but a panic attack is different than just feeling nervous.", "Didn't even read the post before deciding YTA, you knowingly asked after her had a negative experience so you don't get to he upset that he doesn't want to.\n\nYou did kind of pressure him as well btw because the first time he said no should have been enough for you to drop it but you've said you asked him several times. You're also pretty damn dismissive, if he didn't feel confident to go deeper in it really isn't your place to say he didn't try hard enough", "YTA.\n\nAre you out of your ever loving mind?\n\nYou pressured your partner into putting himself into a life threatening situation that could have devolved into putting other people in danger.\n\nAnd apparently that wasn\u2019t enough for you, you had to pressure him again just to make him feel worse.\n\nYour boyfriend is right. You don\u2019t get to judge whether he tried hard enough or not. Not unless you can somehow experience his emotions from the inside.\n\nAnd for the record, when a panic attack, on the verge of or full blown, holds a person back they are going to regret what they missed and from the safety of hindsight think they should have tried harder. It\u2019s natural.\n\nHow about you learn how to be a supportive partner when he experiences these things? Maybe ask if there\u2019s anything you can do to help him at these times, or something in prep that might help.", "It's not about the asking,  it's about you ignoring his physical and obvious distress, deciding his future emotions for him and literally not taking no for an answer.  YTA", "YTA\n\nTop tip for anyone thinking of doing this - do a scuba intro first, at home - at least the pool session. \n\nJosh would have panicked sitting on the bottom of the pool in scuba gear. He would be able to learn whether he could overcome this before buying an expensive scuba holiday.", "YTA - you telling me you know better than he does whether or not he gave it a try? Remember that we are all different and trying is gonna look different for everyone. My dad use to do that shit to me when I was younger and it feels like shit because you feel like you\u2019re not getting heard or understood or validated. Makes people push away", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe glad that he stopped. He was responsible and right to stop. A panic attack while diving can kill easily him, and and enanger you with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is NOT something where you should push him.", "YTA\n\nPanic Attacks are serious, and you didnt want to listen.  You were selfish!", "YTA - I do understand wanting to make sure your partner is giving the experience a real shot, especially if he\u2019s had regrets before. \n\nThat said, he said he did not want to continue multiple times. Scuba diving has real risks, and someone on the verge of a panic attack should not be pushing themselves to continue. You weren\u2019t accepting his no, and you weren\u2019t helping him feel validated in his decisions. \n\nYour partner was probably already having mixed feelings about having to step back from scuba diving. I hope you can see that you didn\u2019t help him feel any better, at the very least. At worst, you undercut his anxieties and guilted him towards a potentially very dangerous situation.", "YTA, he's right, its not your place to say whether he tried it not.", "YTA. You saw him get distressed over the situation and yet you kept pushing. Put yourself in his shoes. Ask yourself if your boyfriend kept putting pressure on you to do something that caused you such a visceral, uncomfortable reaction, would you blow up at him? You probably would. Scuba isn\u2019t like most activities because you literally have to learn how to breathe differently, which can cause unknown fears to pop up. Maybe show a little more heart and kindness.", "YTA he did give it a proper go, twice. But after a panic attack the first time, really seems uncaring and thoughtless to suggest he do it again and again.", "YTA", "YTA.  Do you understand that panic attacks cause physical symptoms that a person has no control over?  Having a panic attack underwater can be deadly.  I had one about 20 feet down, freaked out and pulled out my regulator because I felt like I was choking.  The instructor shoved it back in and brought me to the surface, it was awful.   You need to apologize to your boyfriend.", "YTA I don't know if you have ever had a panic attack, but its the worst feeling, everyone is different but it has been described like you are going to die, like your body is burning inside, like you want to take your skin off, panic attacks are really serious horrible situations and shouldn't be taken lightly, If your boyfriend told you he felt like he was gonna have a panic attack, you should have been supportive and loving, not insist that he goes back to the situation that caused him big emotional distress, and you did it TWICE, you should say you are sorry and ask what you can do to help if he has a panic attack in the future", "How did he manage to pass the checkout dives without having a panic attack?\n\nAs a scuba diver, I vote YTA. If your bf is not comfortable diving, he's not comfortable diving, and the money is irrelevant. Why would you want him as a dive buddy knowing how he is in the water? You better get some experience on the shiny new certification and stop pressuring people who clearly don't want to dive into diving.", "YTA. Pushing someone who is uncomfortable to just push through and dive anyway is incredibly dangerous. He'd be setting himself up for ineffective technique, which can cause dive injuries that can lead to death. If you took the course, then you know damn well that the only person who is responsible for making the call to dive or not is the person diving. He tried twice! He made the right call,and since 15% of recreational divers experience some form of panic at some point you should be understanding of him not arguing with his comfort zone. \n\nDive within your skill set. Another one you should've heard about a thousand times by now. His limit is different than yours. Respect it.", "YTA . I saw that this has happened with other activities like zip lining, and fair enough. But those don't require you to really do anything. You're strapped into a controlled, safe environment so why not? But scuba diving is incredibly dangerous. If you panic on the zipline, you coast to safety in a few seconds/minute. If you panic underwater, you're dead. Also, if your bf has a pattern of not liking these sorts of things...maybe don't encourage trying them? He isn't a thrill seeker. That's ok. Don't go plan stuff like this knowing how he's gonna react.", "INFO: have you recently taken out a large life insurance policy on him?", "YTA.  You shouldn\u2019t have pressured him after the panic attack, but once he gave it a second try and still was uncomfortable, you really needed to leave it alone.  Instead you tried to bulldoze his legitimate safety concerns and because it didn\u2019t suit your preferences.", "YTA. Why are you here for a judgement when you'll fight and debate with everyone telling you that you were horribly wrong? You're not here for honest judgement. You're here to get the satisfaction of knowing you're not the AH.\n\nYou've never had a panic attack (based on your replies). You don't understand how they happen. You are clueless about the fact that most rational thoughts flee people who're going through them. Panic attacks are not a joke. They're not just being a bit uncomfortable that can be worked out by repeating the process. They are a medical concern. Your nonchalant attitude is so callous and insensitive. You're still defending your decision instead of admitting your fault which shows your complete lack of empathy. Your boyfriend deserves so much better.", "YTA - he communicated to you his feelings and how he feels like it would be unsafe for him to try again. Nevertheless, you argued back because he felt unsafe to try again and you didn\u2019t like that answer. My ex would pressure me to do stuff I felt uncomfortable with all the time when I was with him, and that\u2019s mainly a reason why he\u2019s an ex now. I doubt he\u2019s happy that he wasted his money himself, don\u2019t make him feel worse about it", "YTA. \n\nBecause this was all the same day? Like really? If he wanted to do it again today he would! \n\nMaybe in a few years, on another vacation, you could ask. But jeez Louise. Give it a few weeks at least.", "Yes, YTA to keep pushing it.\n\n\u201cHey, I know it\u2019s surely a bummer, was probably awful to have a panic attack, and probably embarrassing to be sitting here on the beach alone, but I just think you didn\u2019t TrY HaRD EnOuGh. Go do it again and relive all that!\u201d\n\nSeriously. Tf is going through your head?", "YTA. The first time after the initial panic attack you tried to convince him to go back in, imo, was fine. Bad 1st starts do happen. However, he had another miserable experience. Once he said no again, that should've been the end of it.", "YTA. First you totally just blew over the fact he was about to have a panic attack, in water, and tried getting him to go into deeper water. Then when he tried explaining why he was upset, rather than apologizing for making him feel bad and like he didn't have a choice, you told him he didn't give it a proper go and just did the exact thing he just blatantly told you made him upset in the first place. Judging by your other responses to comments though, it seems like this isn't/won't be an isolated incident.", "YTA\n\nHe did give it a proper go. You saying he didn\u2019t isn\u2019t just dismissive of his feelings, it\u2019s plain wrong.\n\nPanic attacks aren\u2019t just something you swallow down or postpone to a more convenient time. Having one in the water is about as dangerous as it gets.", "YTA. I have been your boyfriend, and it was unexpected as I don\u2019t get panic attacks, and yes I tried twice. The difference between you and my husband is the level of empathy shown towards us. He told you how he felt and you dismissed him.", "You are definitely the asshole here!!", "YTA-You were pushy and incredibly dismissive of his panic attack. Unless you are personally the one experiencing the panic attack you don\u2019t get to decide if someone tried something properly. You need to learn when to back off.", "Yup. YTA. \n\nI used to drive as well. My husband wanted to try so we tried a Discover SCUBA class. He liked it, but he panicked during submersion. Once at depth, he had a good time and asked me for SCUBA lessons, which I purchased a packaged for his birthday. He did all the oil work prefecture, but got to his open water and again panicked at submersion. I guess he got down with his instructor. However, he panicked again and called the dive. He got home and told me what happened. \n\nSince then, he'll bring it up and I'll ask if he wanted to try again and he says NO. It's about reflecting your partner's comfort level. My husband isn't comfortable and I respect that. \n\nYour BF is telling you the same and your asking him not to honor his feelings to appease you. This is a dangerous sport. Convincing someone to do this when their not 100% sure they want to is not supporting where they're at and potentially putting them in danger because they aren't comfortable with it to start with. \n\nIf diving is important to you, that's fine. Join a dive group and find a new group of buddies who are equally as enthusiastic as you.", "Even without the additional element of the panic attack, why can't you just listen to and believe your bf? You're only serving to make him feel bad about something he can't control. \n\nYTA", "YTA. That sounds like a terrible time. You seem incredibly pushy and unsympathetic.", "YTA\n\nOne of the biggest on here so far.\n\nHe told you no\n\nThat was not ok with you\n\nTried again and still no \n\nYou still keep pushing him \n\nHe could have died, if he can't handle shallow water WHY would you want him in deep water.\n\nDo you even care about this guy??\nAll your comments and responses completely discount his statements and feelings. \n\nLet's change this situation to seggs...\n\nNow do you see how much of a jerk you are??", "YTA he said he didn\u2019t want to go in and even had a panic attack and yet you kept pushing him, if he said no then that\u2019s your answer", "YTA.", "YTA.  Stop being an overbearing and insensitive asshole.  He tried it a 2nd time and it didn\u2019t work.\n\nDid you think of how embarrassing it may have been for you to keep goading him on???\n\nGeesh.", "YTA. \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\". He said no, you pushed. More than once. And YOU, the person who didn't have a panic attack, don't get to decide whether the person who had a panic attack tried or not", "YTA \n As someone who gets like this over small rollercoasters, I understand what your boyfriend is feeling. I nearly ended a friendship over a situation like this. Let your  boyfriend cool down and relax. Better he sits out than get a panic attack in the deeper water.", "YTA. I decided to hold my judgement until after I read since the title was not in your favor at all. But the more I read the more I confirm YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if he was fine with other activities and you think he\u2019ll miss out. He tried it twice and had a panic attack. You don\u2019t just try to convince a person that has a panic attack to go do the thing that gave them the panic attack. Show some empathy please.", "YTA\n\nIf he says, \"I wish I tried to do that again, \" ***then*** ask him if he wants to give it another whirl. If he tells you, not once, but twice, that he doesn't want to do something, believe him. Don't ask again. And if he actually does mention it at a later date, ***then*** suggest it. You're ignoring what he is telling you because ***you*** think you're right and ***you*** think he didn't give it a fair shot and ***you*** think he wasted the money.", "YTA, you're either extremely manipulative or dense.", "Wow YTA!!  \n\nYou clearly do not understand what a panic attack.  You BF absolutely did the sensible by sitting it out.  It was lucky that he still felt panicked after you GUILT TRIPED him into \u201ctrying again\u201d that he was able to say no.\n\nHere is an extract from a scuba diving website regarding panic attacks while diving>\n\n\u201d Panic can kill in many ways. Rapid, shallow breathing can cause hypoxia and a buildup of carbon dioxide. The result: The diver acts irrationally, breathing faster, expelling the regulator or bolting to the surface. These panic responses can make you pass out, or even have a heart attack if you have a weak heart. And panicking impedes your ability to solve problems and get to safety when your equipment malfunctions or you're tangled in a line.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.scubadiving.com/grace-under-pressure\n\nPlease apologise to your BF for trying to kill him AND promise him you will never down play his panic attacks nor pressurise him into doing something he believes is not safe.", "YTA. You and the advanced hiker guy from yesterday should both leave your partners, get together, and make each other miserable.", "YTA\n\nI was in a slightly similar exact scenario once. \n\nMy ex really wanted me to go diving with him in Jamaica. He was an experienced diver, I never had done it. I'm NOT a good swimmer at all plus the idea of it made me anxious. I can manage to swim, but I lack technique. I kept telling him I was not going to pass the test which was required before the dive and he made me feel awful about not even attempting. So I did.\n\nWell I failed miserably. And as it turned out even snorkeling made me anxious. So every day he'd go out on the boat without me and come back annoyed that I wasn't joining. I didn't care, there was plenty of stuff to keep me occupied but his attitude to me sucked.\n\nYour BF literally had a panic attack and that is nothing to minimize. Let him be. Not everyone has to have the same exact interests in a relationship. We all have our strengths and weaknesses and nobody should be made to feel lesser than for not being able to live up to someone else' expectations.", "YTA. \n\nWhen I'm an anxiety attack and need to stop doing something the worst, worst thing to hear is; you will regret it later.  Because no I won't. I will not regret putting my mental health first and taking the time I need to calm down and then DECIDE for myself if I want to try again or not.    \n\n\nAnxiety is not rational and the worst thing to do is push someone when they are in the throes of it and definitely don't tell them you know better how they will feel later. You don't.", "Yikes, yes, YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He said that me asking before made him feel like he couldn't say no and like he didn't give it a proper go. I argued that he didn't, he didn't even make it out into deeper water to put the things we learned to use.\n\nHE HAD A PANIC ATTACK! The fact that you think he \"didn't give it a proper go\" is completely irrelevant. He's right, it's not your place to decide whether he tried properly.", "YTA  He tried it and didn't like it. There was no reason for you to try to talk him into doing it again, especially when it is something that could jeopardize his safety. But you wanted to do it so he should too. Doesn't always work that way. You disrespected him in front of a bunch of other people.", "He had a panic attack in shallow water so why would he want to go deeper?\n\nWhat he said about not wanting to put anyone in a dangerous situation is perfectly logical. \n\nIf he wanted to have another go he would do it without your encouragement. \n\nYTA", "YTA what???", "YTA.\nEveryone has limits.\nHe has found his. Leave him be.", "Yta.  Doing a deep dive in the ocean is dangerous for a first time dive and I\u2019d likely to give someone a panic attack.  There\u2019s a reason most places start training in a pool.", "YTA - surely you aren\u2019t this obtuse\u2026?", "YTA \n\nAs noted, your bf has issues with panic attacks. Do not push him, ESPECIALLY with something as potentially dangerous as scuba diving. \n\nThat said, I want to address bf\u2019s habit of sulking after \u201cnot giving it his all\u201d with similar experiences (like the huge zip line you mentioned in the comments).\n\nI get you care about him, but you\u2019re not his parent raising him as a child. While 22 is young, he\u2019s an adult. He needs to regulate his own emotions, that\u2019s not on you to do. I get panic sucks. I get missing out on experiences suck. But he needs to put in the work (like with a therapist and maybe medication), and address his issues. Sulking as he does only makes you feel worse, and then puts you in a position that eggs you into pushing him like this scuba incident.\n\nDon\u2019t do it. It sets you up as the asshole for boundary stomping. \n\nIf you continue to do stuff with him, and he backs out, then turns around and sulks, tell him you\u2019re sorry he\u2019s disappointed, and you hope he finds the help he needs for the future.

Pushing any further than that is asshole behavior because no is a complete sentence, especially when it comes to anxiety and panic attacks in new and possibly dangerous situations. If it was me and my partner said he was done after the first dive, I would not have pushed it any further, but that's just me.", "yta", "Somewhat.\nIf he's expressed regret in the past, I can see where you are coming from.  \n\nPanic attacks are real.  In his case, he actually was in s situation where he really could die.   Those of us with severe anxiety and panic attacks have learned our triggers and our limits.\nYou have to respect him when he says he's not comfortable doing something.  And coming back and saying how fun it was didn't have the same effect that you thought.  \n\nIf it is really about him potentially regretting missing out, have a talk.\n\nYou respect his wishes and he takes responsibility for his feelings of missing out.

My aunt had a panic attack while scuba diving and couldn\u2019t surface, by the time they got her to the surface she had to resuscitated and we\u2019re very lucky she\u2019s still alive. Your advice could have killed your boyfriend and you don\u2019t even seem to recognise that, you seem to think he\u2019s being difficult on purpose and just needs to get over it", "YTA. You're completely wrong here. You should apologize.", "YTA, I\u2019ve had panic attacks from scuba, it\u2019s literally your brain telling you that you are about to die.", "YTA. Is your boyfriend claustrophobic? Because something like snorkeling would definitely set him off. You should have taken him at his word instead of prodding at him to try again. \n\nHaving a panic attack sucks. You start hyperventilating which leads to dizziness & nausea. You also feel like absolute shit for the next few hours. Next time, don't push.", "I am a strong swimmer and I've panicked while *snorkelling*. I did not go back into the water. It is easy to look from the outside and think it is silly, but it is different when you think you just might die.", "YTA. He had a panic attack in the water, and all you can think about is the wasted money. Your bf brings up a good point. What if it happens in deeper water?? He acted responsibly by understanding his limitations, and you are trying to pressure him into something potentially dangerous and that he doesn't want to do.", "This remind me of the video where the dude broke up with his gf mid Rollercoaster ride, because he didn't want to do it! YTA ! Panic attacks are a serious thing and if someone says no, then its a NO!", "YTA, that was incredibly disrespectful. Panic attacks don\u2019t just vanish.", "YTA \n\nHe is allowed tk say no! Don\u2019t peer pressure people", "YTA but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. Your reasoning is completely plausible but you have to remember anxiety and panic attacks are very often not plausible and they are terrifying. It\u2019s hard to understand that unless you have experienced it so I totally understand where you are coming from. \n\nSo a very soft AH and I think you should just talk with him and research anxiety and if you still don\u2019t understand it then just take his word for it and don\u2019t push him", "You asked, he tried and doesn't like it. You can still go but nagging him makes YTA. . He might like snorkeling better, but sitting on the beach with a drink with an umbrella in it is fun too.", "YTA. It caused him a panic attack and you want to disregard his feelings and his fears for your own selfish ends.", "YTA - pushing him and \"saying he did not give it a proper go\" is just making you the AH. Big time AH. Let it go. Seriously. A person can not handle a panic attic and just get over it. Understand your feelings and desire to have him have a great time. But please let it go. Do not bring it up. Go yourself but let him decide on his own, with NO comments from if he doe it.", "YTA I would NEVER take anyone out diving that was worried they\u2019d panic, everything to go wrong on land is 10x worse under water. This isn\u2019t just a regret like anything else you did. If he did have a panic attack he could either ascend too quickly or rip his regulator out, both can be deadly.", "YTA, not because of just suggesting he try it again; that's fine as long as it's done in a friendly, patient and understanding way.\n\nBut you are totally glossing over the panic attack and not caring about his feelings at all. He knows how he feels, and instead of asking him to scuba dive again you should be saying things like \"oh wow that sounds like such a terrifying experience, I'm sorry you had to go through that\" and asking if there is anything that you can do with him or something.", "YTA.  Your lack of empathy is astounding.  Prepare to be dumped upon arrival home...or before.  It's deserved.", "YTA - I ca't imagine how dangerous it would be to have a panic attack while under water, having them on land is hard enough!", "YTA, I am a SCUBA instructor. You did this all the wrong way. Should have first tried a DSD (discover SCUBA diving) in a pool.\n\nYou have unfortunately ensured he will never do this with you.  My wife would.panic with a mask on her face even in our living room. Fortunately for me my son enjoyed snorkeling and once he was old enough at 10 I got him certified and at 18 he was a divemaster. But when he was young and I would pay for a 2 tank dive he would tire after one dive. I knew never to press him or I would have lost him as a dive buddy. It wasn't until he saw his first sharks at the Big Blue Hole in Belize that he wanted to do a second and third dive for the day.\n\nYou pushed rather than encouraged. It wasn't your intention but that is what you did.", "[removed]", "YTA. Lifelong diver here. Panic attacks are how people die. They lose focus and do dumb things like pulling out their or others regulators, get disoriented and swim down, or even more dangerous actions like surfacing too fast. He did the right thing and you were low key shaming him for it.", "YTA. If he had given in to your pressuring him and had a panic attack underwater you\u2019d then be asking \u201cam I the asshole for killing my partner\u201d", "YTA\n\nHe correctly assessed that having a panic attack underwater would be a dangerous thing and made the good decision not to push himself. He knows how he was feeling better than you and if you paid attention in the classes, I'm sure you heard that people's lives are more important than seeing pretty fish.", "YTA. SCUBA is inherently dangerous. You should never pressure anyone, particularly someone you love. My husband was done after the pool rest, five years later he tried it again and loved it. Guess what, I didn't pressure him and let him decide for himself", "Yeah, YTA slightly. You were well-intentioned, but you have to respect his feelings. Panic attacks are no joke. People go to the hospital for it because the symptoms can mimic a heart attack. He literally could have drowned.", "YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. I have severe anxiety I have a deep desire to do new things and have cool experiences but if I start to panic, it\u2019s all over. As much as I might want to do whatever it is and regret not being able to, it\u2019s just not going to happen. If my husband reacted like this when I told him I was going to have a panic attack if I continued with an activity, I wouldn\u2019t still be with him.", "YTA, but I\u2019m saying this gently, because you sound very young. \n\nYour bf made the right decision. It would have been the same decision a decent instructor also would have made for him. He should not be scuba diving, for his own safety, and for your safety as well. What if you pushed him to keep going and he caved. You both became certified and started doing solo/couples dives. And then something happens where your life depends on him and he panics? \n\nI\u2019m all for encouraging your partner to do hard things, but the decision has been made. YTA for continuing to push it.", "YTA. you should appologize to him.   \n\n\nHe would almost certainly panic exactly the same way, and hes right. it would put he, and everyone else in danger. trust his instincts on what he can and cannot handle.", "YTA and you seem like you just don't get it. Panic attacks can be serious, especially in water!!!", "YTA.   Stop asking.  He's right, it's not your place.  Leave it alone.", "YTA why keep trying to force someone to do some thing they are clearly petrified and uncomfortable with?", "YTA. You don't take him and his panic attack seriously. You're passive-aggressive and dismissive. \nI hope he finds someone better, for his sake, because you show a lack of care and empathy", "You didn\u2019t mean to be but you\u2019re 100% TA, YTA.\n\nHe was having a panic attack, that\u2019s all you need to hear in the future.

Your boyfriend was keeping you both safe. If he felt a panic attack coming on it was safest for him to remove himself from the situation and sit somewhere safe and quiet. Mental health isn\u2019t a damn joke, if he\u2019s prone to these kind of attacks he probably also knows his limits a whole lot better than you do.

How in the sake of god OP think she isnt?\n\n>I also don't think me asking him to try again was a big deal because he's done this with other similar adventure activities we've tried and always laments he regrets not fully committing to the activity.\n\nMaybe bc OP keep pushing to do that adventure activities again and again and bf wants to join to support OP and then when he cant make it, he feels like a failure bc OP obviously like that activity, why he doesn't?", "YTA", "I had a similar reaction the first time I tried diving, but it was in a tank. As soon as I took my first breath while underwater, my brains alarm bells started ringing that I did something bad, get out of the water.\n\nIt took me like 30 minutes before I was able to focus myself and actually get past the mental block. Once I did it was a ton of fun and something I really want to try again.", "Dude, your lack of empathy for your boyfriend and dismissal of his attempt to avoid putting himself in a position where he has a serious physical reaction is one thing. \n\nBut you\u2019re seriously lacking some common sense or more for pressuring a person who is worried they may have a panic attack UNDER WATER, continue scuba diving. I mean you took the scuba course right? Most of us have enough common sense but you should have learned by now that having control of your breathing is one of the most important parts of scuba diving. I\u2019m sure if you\u2019ve ever been there for your boyfriend while he\u2019s had a panic attack before, you\u2019d see why it\u2019s not a good thing that he has one UNDER WATER.  \n\nSeriously, wtf?", "YTA. Diving and rolling a kayak are two things you usually only need to do one time to know that you don\u2019t want to do them again.", "Right? It\u2019s similar to getting in a coffin underground. You\u2019re either ok with losing complete control of yourself, your breathing, your safety, etc. or you\u2019re not. People definitely die doing this if they can\u2019t handle it. I have zero idea why anyone with any sense would peer pressure someone that had a panic attack to *just try again and suck it up*.", "My general rule is to not do things that you are afraid of as long as it only affects you.\n\nI would never want to go sky diving again so if a SO asked me to do that I would refuse.\n\nBut that's because I have done skydiving and I just don't like it. Meanwhile I've done base jumping and I absolutely love it.", "That happened to my sister as well. She gave snorkeling a go, thought she could do it, but panicked. And that was that. No one, esp her husband, bugged her or said anything about \u201cmissing out.\u201d", "It's particularly bad for scuba because you have limited oxygen and panicking makes you use it up a LOT faster.  It's legitimately dangerous if you can't stay calm under water.", "We were shown how to use air to get back to the surface", "Definitely didn't rub it in his face. He asked me if I saw anything and I told him what I saw", "We've done this before though, he always regrets it. We tried doing this huge zipline thing and he didn't want to do it because of the height and he was upset he didn't do it the next day and was in a mood about it. I know what he's like", "Right?! OP are you trying to kill him?! Sorry, that was a bit dramatic but if anyone I loved had a panic attack while scuba diving I would be pissed at them for even considering doing it again let alone encourage it/ask them to do it again.", "I thought maybe it was because its a new thing so his first time under was different and another go he might feel differently", "Obviously because the THIRD time he tried it he would have an amazing time and his lizard brain wouldn't freak out again and tell him he's going to die! /s", "No I've never had one nor been in a situation where someone has had one", "Really? I didn't see it as me forcing him to go underwater", "Yes, not just for panic attacks, I have known people that couldn't equalise (clearing the pressure in your ear). If they can't get used to doing that in a pool, they probably won't be able to do it in deep water. If you can at least find that out beforehand, you may save yourself a lot of money.", "Practice is one thing but when it get real, it's totally another.\n\nI learned that I can not even snorkel as having the equipment on and putting my head into the water is just a GIANT nope.

Have you ever had one? Knowing what to do in a particular situation becomes completely meaningless. I started having an attack while snorkeling, right at the surface, and managed to inhale a mouthful of water after nearly vomiting into the mouthpiece. Panic is not logical. Panicked people can become incredibly unsafe to themselves and those around them. I regret that I had to sit out two afternoons of snorkeling, but I don\u2019t regret not pushing myself to do it.", "When you are panicking, the rational, logical part of your brain goes MIA. Period. Your boyfriend did the 100% right thing. You don't screw around with safety in the water.\n\nAlso, YTA for all the reasons others have noted.", "It doesn\u2019t matter. Because a person having a panic attack is not thinking or acting rationally. You could be a highly trained individual, and a panic attack can cripple you in the moment.", "So what? I'm guessing you never had a panic attack. Also guessing you have zero empathy. YTA. Grow up.", "OP. One thing you absolutely need to understand is that when people are in panic mode, no matter how experienced they may be or claim to be, they can make very rash, very dangerous decisions. \n\nPlenty of expert divers have rushed to the surface, completely disregarding the risk of nitrogen narcosis in a panicked state. Plenty of experts have even died as a result of panicking. Experts. Let me say it again for you. ***Experts have died***. \n\nYour boyfriend was having a panic attack and you pushed him and then argued that he didn't try. That's not up to you to make that decision for him, that he could have still done it. That's is entirely up to him and the diving instructors. \n\nSafety is first priority, always. I think you need to go back and take some more classes on safety ASAP. You may think your heart is in the right place, and in some instances it can be. For instance when I urged by buddy to go get his favorite actor's autograph at a booth at a convention and anxiety was keeping him locked in place even when he wanted to talk to the actor. In a situation that can easily turn dangerous is not the time to push through boundaries and take risks.", "Yes, because rational thought is the last thing to go when panicking/s", "People don't remember that shit during a PANIC ATTACK, are you freaking daft? Maybe you should go see a doctor about your psychotic lack of empathy. I wouldn't marry you after this for sure.", "You...don't use air to get back to the surface. Wtf are they teaching you?", "next time put in the OP that you've never had a panic attack and think he's just making shit up and being a baby. No fucking way you have any idea what a panic attack is like", "Would your bf  have remembered that mid-panic attack? Your bf felt unsafe and you tried to pressure him into endangering himself. And for what? Because you think you know your bf's limits better than he does? Get a grip.", "As others have said, you do realize in the middle of a panic attack, your partner most likely isn't going to remember what they were taught, right? Especially incredibly new knowledge. \n\nYTA.", "Yeah?  And?  Your bf likely wouldn\u2019t think about any of that in the middle of a panic attack.", "I\u2019m assuming from this, you\u2019ve never had a panic attack. I can barely breathe during a panic attack while just sitting on my couch. There is zero chance that I\u2019d be able to operate scuba gear during one, regardless of how much training I\u2019d had. He\u2019d not only be putting himself in danger, but everyone else as well. You\u2019re being unreasonable, dismissive, and ableist.", "Doesn't work if he panics, does it?", "People, who were drowning and panicked, sometimes have accidentally killed that tried to rescue them, because in their panic they keep flailing and do everything to stay afloat. They usually also drown themselves too. \n\nSo in panic, your bf wouldn't have known that and possibly drowned.", "OK fair enough, I take that back.", "Have you had a panic attack? Because I have. In fact, I had one while attempting scuba diving in Australia, on my honeymoon. I jumped in, went under, said nope, resurfaced and got back in the boat. One of the crew took me for a snorkel instead once I felt better and pointed out things I would have otherwise missed. It was great. My husband took some pictures underwater to show me, and I lived vicariously through them. No regrets. Panic attacks are scary and you are pushy. Stop it and let him make his own decisions. The proper response is \u201care you ok? Do you need anything?\u201d", "Being upset that you're incapable of a thing you want to accomplish due to consistent fear isn't the same thing as saying you wanna go try it again until youre not scared. And fwiw ziplining is a lot safer than scuba.", "That\u2019s called being an adult. As an adult, he gets to decide what he\u2019s comfortable with and as an adult the consequences of those decisions rest solely on him. \n\nOne of the things emphasized when I did my dive training was to dive to your own comfort and that of your partner. Your bf was incredibly mature and a good partner by not insisting you sit out with him and showing genuine interest in your experience. \n\nYou need to be a good partner as well and not try to pressure him into something he isn\u2019t 100% comfortable doing. Be understanding. Offer to try again at another time if he would like or plan a snorkeling trip. You can see lots of amazing things with a snorkel. \n\nIn this instance, YTA.", "Do you think maybe that's because people keep making him feel like he should try harder? That literally increases the toll anxiety has already taken on them and then throws guilt and shame on top of it.\n\nEdit typo", "No, you do not get it. YOu think he just fears missing out when what he is upset about his anxiety and fear.  You can't get over those things by not getting support and help. You just want to throw him int the deep water and expect him to get over himself...   \n\n\nHow about suggest therapy and talking to someone about his anxieties. And you should do some research into it too so you can be a better less self focused partner.", "My wife is a lot more anxious than me.  It sucks either missing out on activities or doing some solo, but it's just one of those compromises of marriage.  He might be upset that he missed out on something, but that doesn't mean pushing harder is the right approach.  Pushing people too hard past their comfort zone never works, it just reinforces the anxiety.", "NOT the same situation. \n\nHe DID the scuba diving. And had to fight off a panic attack. Putting him in *deeper water* isn\u2019t going to change that.

Rather than ask me to continue, he said we should go to the pub and chill out.", "Or it could go worse, and now he knew how little you care about his well being", "Did it occur to you to ask the dive master whether or not he'd be okay with a potentially panicked newbie diver? And I mean an *honest* question, with the dive master *fully informed* that your bf felt that he was about to have a panic attack.

It's hard to breathe in a normal air environment with one, I can't imagine having one with an air mask on.", "Try and take this as a learning opportunity! I'm not gonna call you an asshole for lack of experience, just try and be mindful of this sort of thing in the future. :)", "A person having a panic attack knows that it may not be logical but there is not a lot that a person can do.

Stop pressing and start supporting.", "You're being obtuse intentionally.  Stop it.", "Asking him more than once in front of others puts him on the spot and makes him feel like he should instead of like you're actually asking his opinion.

You sound young, arrogant, and insufferable; I hope you grow out of all three.", "Even pros die while diving because they have panic attacks.\n\nAnd frankly, I would highly doubt the instructors who are ok with pressuring someone to dive who does not want to and who is panicking.", "Right?

My husband cuddled me and said he\u2019d never been more scared than when he saw me have the panic attack (scared the shit out of my adult kids too). You have a bf that has some mild phobias (although the diving seems more severe). The very last thing you want to do is push someone into facing them. Even if you think you\u2019re not, you are.

You don't fuck around with water and safety, and a person having a panic attack is not going to be able to make safe decisions. They are also not going to have fun. \n\nYOU should do some more research about panic attacks before you keep telling your partner how he should handle them. Do some reading, and watch some YouTube videos of people describing what a panic attack feels like.", "That much is obvious to those of us who have. You really should go give your bf the BIGGEST apology ever."]}
