We started it a few days ago. It involves going through scuba theory where we were tested and we passed and the instructors brought us to the beach to give it a go today.\n\nI really enjoyed it. My boyfriend less so. We're both strong swimmers which is why we decided to try it. However, once my boyfriend got under the water, he started to panic. He immediately surfaced and said he felt like a panic attack was coming on and wanted to leave. He wanted to get out of the gear and sit on the beach to wait for us but I gently persuaded him to give it another go because I know he would regret it later if he didn't at least try and waste all the money he spent. He did give it another go but struggled and sat on the beach so the rest of us went back out and had a great time.\n\nI joined him after and explained how much fun it was and that we saw some fish. He was really happy for me so I asked him again if he wants to give it another go and he just shut me down. He said that me asking before made him feel like he couldn't say no and like he didn't give it a proper go. I argued that he didn't, he didn't even make it out into deeper water to put the things we learned to use. He maintains that he didn't want to have a panic attack in the deeper water and put us in danger and its not my place to say whether he tried properly or not because he thinks he did. \n\nWas I an asshole? I asked out of a good place because he looked so excited with the fish. I also don't think me asking him to try again was a big deal because he's done this with other similar adventure activities we've tried and always laments he regrets not fully committing to the activity.", "created_utc": 1687125725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cwjhi/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_scuba_dive_again/", "score": 1387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't matter what other activities he regrets not fully committing to, we're talking about water. Deep water.\n\nI had a panic attack while snorkeling on my honeymoon. My husband and our guide got me out of the water as fast as they could and no one tried encouraging me to give it another go because money would be wasted. People DROWN during a panic attack.", "YTA, not for asking him to scuba dive again, but for later trying to argue that he \"didn't try hard enough\". He's right, it's not your place to say.\n\nYour boyfriend did a sensible thing. Him having a panic attack underwater could have put others in danger, not just himself. \n\nAlso I do get a small sense of you rubbing it in his face that you had a great time and he missed out.", "YTA - I am a DiveMaster of 29 years, a scuba diver of 33 years.\n\nANYONE can call the dive for ANY REASON! Back in 2006, my wife and I were on a Liveaboard dive boat, and prepping for the night dive. I jumped in the water, swam to the line, and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, one of the Boat DiveMaster's called me back onboard. My wife was too nervous for this dive, but had been unwilling to call it and thought that if I jumped first, she would have to follow through. Needless to say she didn't, and that WAS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE! I just wish she had said so earlier, I could have avoided another shower or found another buddy.\n\nI have decades of dive experience, well over a thousand dives, hundreds of hours logged (and unlogged), I have NO PROBLEMS ABORTING A DIVE if I am uncomfortable with it, whether that be prior to the dive, or once in the water.\n\nYou NEVER force a person beyond their comfort zone unless you wish to create problems that can result in injury or death. I have dealt with multiple panicked divers underwater and on the surface (that is part of being a DiveMaster). A goal is prevent that from ever happening so that I don't have to perform a rescue or a recovery. \n\nMy biggest joy in helping with Open Water classes is to help those who may have barely passed the class (or failed it) build their skills so that they pass with flying colors and enjoy diving. But part of that is recognizing discomfort early on and alleviating it, not forcing people through it.", "YTA. You were incredibly pushy and showed no consideration for how he felt.", "YTA\n\nJust think it through.\n\nYour boyfriend almost had a panic attack underwater, and you asked him to do the thing that almost gave him a panic attack again?\n\nHow is this even a wise decision?", "YTA\n\nHe had a panic attack in the water. You asked him to try again. He did and had another panic attack. Then you pushed him to try AGAIN. Why?\n\nLeave him the heck alone. He's an adult, not a child. Panic attacks are not a small thing. Don't try to control him.", "YTA because \"I argued that he didn't, he didn't even make it out into deeper water...\" \n\nYou were fine to ask if he wanted to go again the first time. But he panicked twice and it was smart of him to decline after that. You should have let it go then.\n\nSo tired of people thinking that people 'just aren't trying hard enough\" when they're literally PANICKING. Panic attacks are no joke. They can literally incapacitate you. Your bf could have DIED if he were hyperventilating/freezing in deep water wherein his body was not under his control and he was deep under water.", "Yes you were the asshole.  The same thing happened to me.  I'm a very strong swimmer,  on competitive teams, avid snorkelers.  On my checkout dives for certification I too had a panic attack.  You can't predict how you will react in open water \n\nPanic attacks are terrifying. You truly feel like you are dying and this is it.  Diving isn't for him.  Stop pressing him to do something that traumatized him.  Be a supportive girlfriend or he might wave goodbye to you for being an asshole.", "Info: Is this your very first time dealing with someone having a panic attack? I'm genuinely asking because you seem to not really get what that means. I'm hoping it's just lack of experience and not willful ignorance. \n\nPanic attacks are not logical or reasonable. You can have all the training in the world, be an absolute expert at diving, and still drown if you have a panic attack while under. Your boyfriend made the safest choice for both himself and the people around him.\n\nI get that sometimes he needs a little encouragement to try new, adventurous things, but a panic attack is different than just feeling nervous.", "Didn't even read the post before deciding YTA, you knowingly asked after her had a negative experience so you don't get to he upset that he doesn't want to.\n\nYou did kind of pressure him as well btw because the first time he said no should have been enough for you to drop it but you've said you asked him several times. You're also pretty damn dismissive, if he didn't feel confident to go deeper in it really isn't your place to say he didn't try hard enough", "YTA.\n\nAre you out of your ever loving mind?\n\nYou pressured your partner into putting himself into a life threatening situation that could have devolved into putting other people in danger.\n\nAnd apparently that wasn\u2019t enough for you, you had to pressure him again just to make him feel worse.\n\nYour boyfriend is right. You don\u2019t get to judge whether he tried hard enough or not. Not unless you can somehow experience his emotions from the inside.\n\nAnd for the record, when a panic attack, on the verge of or full blown, holds a person back they are going to regret what they missed and from the safety of hindsight think they should have tried harder. It\u2019s natural.\n\nHow about you learn how to be a supportive partner when he experiences these things? Maybe ask if there\u2019s anything you can do to help him at these times, or something in prep that might help.", "It's not about the asking,  it's about you ignoring his physical and obvious distress, deciding his future emotions for him and literally not taking no for an answer.  YTA", "YTA\n\nTop tip for anyone thinking of doing this - do a scuba intro first, at home - at least the pool session. \n\nJosh would have panicked sitting on the bottom of the pool in scuba gear. He would be able to learn whether he could overcome this before buying an expensive scuba holiday.", "YTA - you telling me you know better than he does whether or not he gave it a try? Remember that we are all different and trying is gonna look different for everyone. My dad use to do that shit to me when I was younger and it feels like shit because you feel like you\u2019re not getting heard or understood or validated. Makes people push away", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe glad that he stopped. He was responsible and right to stop. A panic attack while diving can kill easily him, and and enanger you with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is NOT something where you should push him.", "YTA\n\nPanic Attacks are serious, and you didnt want to listen.  You were selfish!", "YTA - I do understand wanting to make sure your partner is giving the experience a real shot, especially if he\u2019s had regrets before. \n\nThat said, he said he did not want to continue multiple times. Scuba diving has real risks, and someone on the verge of a panic attack should not be pushing themselves to continue. You weren\u2019t accepting his no, and you weren\u2019t helping him feel validated in his decisions. \n\nYour partner was probably already having mixed feelings about having to step back from scuba diving. I hope you can see that you didn\u2019t help him feel any better, at the very least. At worst, you undercut his anxieties and guilted him towards a potentially very dangerous situation.", "YTA, he's right, its not your place to say whether he tried it not.", "YTA. You saw him get distressed over the situation and yet you kept pushing. Put yourself in his shoes. Ask yourself if your boyfriend kept putting pressure on you to do something that caused you such a visceral, uncomfortable reaction, would you blow up at him? You probably would. Scuba isn\u2019t like most activities because you literally have to learn how to breathe differently, which can cause unknown fears to pop up. Maybe show a little more heart and kindness.", "YTA he did give it a proper go, twice. But after a panic attack the first time, really seems uncaring and thoughtless to suggest he do it again and again.", "YTA", "YTA.  Do you understand that panic attacks cause physical symptoms that a person has no control over?  Having a panic attack underwater can be deadly.  I had one about 20 feet down, freaked out and pulled out my regulator because I felt like I was choking.  The instructor shoved it back in and brought me to the surface, it was awful.   You need to apologize to your boyfriend.", "YTA I don't know if you have ever had a panic attack, but its the worst feeling, everyone is different but it has been described like you are going to die, like your body is burning inside, like you want to take your skin off, panic attacks are really serious horrible situations and shouldn't be taken lightly, If your boyfriend told you he felt like he was gonna have a panic attack, you should have been supportive and loving, not insist that he goes back to the situation that caused him big emotional distress, and you did it TWICE, you should say you are sorry and ask what you can do to help if he has a panic attack in the future", "How did he manage to pass the checkout dives without having a panic attack?\n\nAs a scuba diver, I vote YTA. If your bf is not comfortable diving, he's not comfortable diving, and the money is irrelevant. Why would you want him as a dive buddy knowing how he is in the water? You better get some experience on the shiny new certification and stop pressuring people who clearly don't want to dive into diving.", "YTA. Pushing someone who is uncomfortable to just push through and dive anyway is incredibly dangerous. He'd be setting himself up for ineffective technique, which can cause dive injuries that can lead to death. If you took the course, then you know damn well that the only person who is responsible for making the call to dive or not is the person diving. He tried twice! He made the right call,and since 15% of recreational divers experience some form of panic at some point you should be understanding of him not arguing with his comfort zone. \n\nDive within your skill set. Another one you should've heard about a thousand times by now. His limit is different than yours. Respect it.", "YTA . I saw that this has happened with other activities like zip lining, and fair enough. But those don't require you to really do anything. You're strapped into a controlled, safe environment so why not? But scuba diving is incredibly dangerous. If you panic on the zipline, you coast to safety in a few seconds/minute. If you panic underwater, you're dead. Also, if your bf has a pattern of not liking these sorts of things...maybe don't encourage trying them? He isn't a thrill seeker. That's ok. Don't go plan stuff like this knowing how he's gonna react.", "INFO: have you recently taken out a large life insurance policy on him?", "YTA.  You shouldn\u2019t have pressured him after the panic attack, but once he gave it a second try and still was uncomfortable, you really needed to leave it alone.  Instead you tried to bulldoze his legitimate safety concerns and because it didn\u2019t suit your preferences.", "YTA. Why are you here for a judgement when you'll fight and debate with everyone telling you that you were horribly wrong? You're not here for honest judgement. You're here to get the satisfaction of knowing you're not the AH.\n\nYou've never had a panic attack (based on your replies). You don't understand how they happen. You are clueless about the fact that most rational thoughts flee people who're going through them. Panic attacks are not a joke. They're not just being a bit uncomfortable that can be worked out by repeating the process. They are a medical concern. Your nonchalant attitude is so callous and insensitive. You're still defending your decision instead of admitting your fault which shows your complete lack of empathy. Your boyfriend deserves so much better.", "YTA - he communicated to you his feelings and how he feels like it would be unsafe for him to try again. Nevertheless, you argued back because he felt unsafe to try again and you didn\u2019t like that answer. My ex would pressure me to do stuff I felt uncomfortable with all the time when I was with him, and that\u2019s mainly a reason why he\u2019s an ex now. I doubt he\u2019s happy that he wasted his money himself, don\u2019t make him feel worse about it", "YTA. \n\nBecause this was all the same day? Like really? If he wanted to do it again today he would! \n\nMaybe in a few years, on another vacation, you could ask. But jeez Louise. Give it a few weeks at least.", "Yes, YTA to keep pushing it.\n\n\u201cHey, I know it\u2019s surely a bummer, was probably awful to have a panic attack, and probably embarrassing to be sitting here on the beach alone, but I just think you didn\u2019t TrY HaRD EnOuGh. Go do it again and relive all that!\u201d\n\nSeriously. Tf is going through your head?", "YTA. The first time after the initial panic attack you tried to convince him to go back in, imo, was fine. Bad 1st starts do happen. However, he had another miserable experience. Once he said no again, that should've been the end of it.", "YTA. First you totally just blew over the fact he was about to have a panic attack, in water, and tried getting him to go into deeper water. Then when he tried explaining why he was upset, rather than apologizing for making him feel bad and like he didn't have a choice, you told him he didn't give it a proper go and just did the exact thing he just blatantly told you made him upset in the first place. Judging by your other responses to comments though, it seems like this isn't/won't be an isolated incident.", "YTA\n\nHe did give it a proper go. You saying he didn\u2019t isn\u2019t just dismissive of his feelings, it\u2019s plain wrong.\n\nPanic attacks aren\u2019t just something you swallow down or postpone to a more convenient time. Having one in the water is about as dangerous as it gets.", "YTA. I have been your boyfriend, and it was unexpected as I don\u2019t get panic attacks, and yes I tried twice. The difference between you and my husband is the level of empathy shown towards us. He told you how he felt and you dismissed him.", "You are definitely the asshole here!!", "YTA-You were pushy and incredibly dismissive of his panic attack. Unless you are personally the one experiencing the panic attack you don\u2019t get to decide if someone tried something properly. You need to learn when to back off.", "Yup. YTA. \n\nI used to drive as well. My husband wanted to try so we tried a Discover SCUBA class. He liked it, but he panicked during submersion. Once at depth, he had a good time and asked me for SCUBA lessons, which I purchased a packaged for his birthday. He did all the oil work prefecture, but got to his open water and again panicked at submersion. I guess he got down with his instructor. However, he panicked again and called the dive. He got home and told me what happened. \n\nSince then, he'll bring it up and I'll ask if he wanted to try again and he says NO. It's about reflecting your partner's comfort level. My husband isn't comfortable and I respect that. \n\nYour BF is telling you the same and your asking him not to honor his feelings to appease you. This is a dangerous sport. Convincing someone to do this when their not 100% sure they want to is not supporting where they're at and potentially putting them in danger because they aren't comfortable with it to start with. \n\nIf diving is important to you, that's fine. Join a dive group and find a new group of buddies who are equally as enthusiastic as you.", "Even without the additional element of the panic attack, why can't you just listen to and believe your bf? You're only serving to make him feel bad about something he can't control. \n\nYTA", "YTA. That sounds like a terrible time. You seem incredibly pushy and unsympathetic.", "YTA\n\nOne of the biggest on here so far.\n\nHe told you no\n\nThat was not ok with you\n\nTried again and still no \n\nYou still keep pushing him \n\nHe could have died, if he can't handle shallow water WHY would you want him in deep water.\n\nDo you even care about this guy??\nAll your comments and responses completely discount his statements and feelings. \n\nLet's change this situation to seggs...\n\nNow do you see how much of a jerk you are??", "YTA he said he didn\u2019t want to go in and even had a panic attack and yet you kept pushing him, if he said no then that\u2019s your answer", "YTA.", "YTA.  Stop being an overbearing and insensitive asshole.  He tried it a 2nd time and it didn\u2019t work.\n\nDid you think of how embarrassing it may have been for you to keep goading him on???\n\nGeesh.", "YTA. \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\". He said no, you pushed. More than once. And YOU, the person who didn't have a panic attack, don't get to decide whether the person who had a panic attack tried or not", "YTA \n As someone who gets like this over small rollercoasters, I understand what your boyfriend is feeling. I nearly ended a friendship over a situation like this. Let your  boyfriend cool down and relax. Better he sits out than get a panic attack in the deeper water.", "YTA. I decided to hold my judgement until after I read since the title was not in your favor at all. But the more I read the more I confirm YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if he was fine with other activities and you think he\u2019ll miss out. He tried it twice and had a panic attack. You don\u2019t just try to convince a person that has a panic attack to go do the thing that gave them the panic attack. Show some empathy please.", "YTA\n\nIf he says, \"I wish I tried to do that again, \" ***then*** ask him if he wants to give it another whirl. If he tells you, not once, but twice, that he doesn't want to do something, believe him. Don't ask again. And if he actually does mention it at a later date, ***then*** suggest it. You're ignoring what he is telling you because ***you*** think you're right and ***you*** think he didn't give it a fair shot and ***you*** think he wasted the money.", "YTA, you're either extremely manipulative or dense.", "Wow YTA!!\n\nYou clearly do not understand what a panic attack is.  Your BF absolutely did the sensible by sitting it out.  It was lucky that he still felt panicked after you GUILT TRIPED him into \u201ctrying again\u201d that he was able to say no.\n\nHere is an extract from a scuba diving website regarding panic attacks while diving>\n\n\u201d Panic can kill in many ways. Rapid, shallow breathing can cause hypoxia and a buildup of carbon dioxide. The result: The diver acts irrationally, breathing faster, expelling the regulator or bolting to the surface. These panic responses can make you pass out, or even have a heart attack if you have a weak heart. And panicking impedes your ability to solve problems and get to safety when your equipment malfunctions or you're tangled in a line.\u201d\n\n[https://www.scubadiving.com/grace-under-pressure](https://www.scubadiving.com/grace-under-pressure)\n\nPlease apologise to your BF for trying to kill him AND promise him you will never down play his panic attacks nor pressurise him into doing something he believes is not safe.", "YTA. You and the advanced hiker guy from yesterday should both leave your partners, get together, and make each other miserable.", "YTA\n\nI was in a slightly similar exact scenario once. \n\nMy ex really wanted me to go diving with him in Jamaica. He was an experienced diver, I never had done it. I'm NOT a good swimmer at all plus the idea of it made me anxious. I can manage to swim, but I lack technique. I kept telling him I was not going to pass the test which was required before the dive and he made me feel awful about not even attempting. So I did.\n\nWell I failed miserably. And as it turned out even snorkeling made me anxious. So every day he'd go out on the boat without me and come back annoyed that I wasn't joining. I didn't care, there was plenty of stuff to keep me occupied but his attitude to me sucked.\n\nYour BF literally had a panic attack and that is nothing to minimize. Let him be. Not everyone has to have the same exact interests in a relationship. We all have our strengths and weaknesses and nobody should be made to feel lesser than for not being able to live up to someone else' expectations.", "YTA. \n\nWhen I'm an anxiety attack and need to stop doing something the worst, worst thing to hear is; you will regret it later.  Because no I won't. I will not regret putting my mental health first and taking the time I need to calm down and then DECIDE for myself if I want to try again or not.    \n\n\nAnxiety is not rational and the worst thing to do is push someone when they are in the throes of it and definitely don't tell them you know better how they will feel later. You don't.", "Yikes, yes, YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He said that me asking before made him feel like he couldn't say no and like he didn't give it a proper go. I argued that he didn't, he didn't even make it out into deeper water to put the things we learned to use.\n\nHE HAD A PANIC ATTACK! The fact that you think he \"didn't give it a proper go\" is completely irrelevant. He's right, it's not your place to decide whether he tried properly.", "YTA  He tried it and didn't like it. There was no reason for you to try to talk him into doing it again, especially when it is something that could jeopardize his safety. But you wanted to do it so he should too. Doesn't always work that way. You disrespected him in front of a bunch of other people.", "He had a panic attack in shallow water so why would he want to go deeper?\n\nWhat he said about not wanting to put anyone in a dangerous situation is perfectly logical. \n\nIf he wanted to have another go he would do it without your encouragement. \n\nYTA", "YTA what???", "YTA.\nEveryone has limits.\nHe has found his. Leave him be.", "Yta.  Doing a deep dive in the ocean is dangerous for a first time dive and I\u2019d likely to give someone a panic attack.  There\u2019s a reason most places start training in a pool.", "YTA - surely you aren\u2019t this obtuse\u2026?", "YTA \n\nAs noted, your bf has issues with panic attacks. Do not push him, ESPECIALLY with something as potentially dangerous as scuba diving. \n\nThat said, I want to address bf\u2019s habit of sulking after \u201cnot giving it his all\u201d with similar experiences (like the huge zip line you mentioned in the comments).\n\nI get you care about him, but you\u2019re not his parent raising him as a child. While 22 is young, he\u2019s an adult. He needs to regulate his own emotions, that\u2019s not on you to do. I get panic sucks. I get missing out on experiences suck. But he needs to put in the work (like with a therapist and maybe medication), and address his issues. Sulking as he does only makes you feel worse, and then puts you in a position that eggs you into pushing him like this scuba incident.\n\nDon\u2019t do it. It sets you up as the asshole for boundary stomping. \n\nIf you continue to do stuff with him, and he backs out, then turns around and sulks, tell him you\u2019re sorry he\u2019s disappointed, and you hope he finds the help he needs for the future.

Pushing any further than that is asshole behavior because no is a complete sentence, especially when it comes to anxiety and panic attacks in new and possibly dangerous situations. If it was me and my partner said he was done after the first dive, I would not have pushed it any further, but that's just me.", "yta", "Somewhat.\nIf he's expressed regret in the past, I can see where you are coming from.  \n\nPanic attacks are real.  In his case, he actually was in s situation where he really could die.   Those of us with severe anxiety and panic attacks have learned our triggers and our limits.\nYou have to respect him when he says he's not comfortable doing something.  And coming back and saying how fun it was didn't have the same effect that you thought.  \n\nIf it is really about him potentially regretting missing out, have a talk.\n\nYou respect his wishes and he takes responsibility for his feelings of missing out.

You can be taught all the theory in the world, but that all goes out the window when you start to panic and feel like you\u2019re trapped. My aunt had a panic attack while scuba diving and couldn\u2019t surface, by the time they got her to the surface she had to resuscitated and we\u2019re very lucky she\u2019s still alive.

You did this all the wrong way. Should have first tried a DSD (discover SCUBA diving) in a pool.\n\nYou have unfortunately ensured he will never do this with you.  My wife would.panic with a mask on her face even in our living room. Fortunately for me my son enjoyed snorkeling and once he was old enough at 10 I got him certified and at 18 he was a divemaster. But when he was young and I would pay for a 2 tank dive he would tire after one dive. I knew never to press him or I would have lost him as a dive buddy.

I mean you took the scuba course right? Most of us have enough common sense but you should have learned by now that having control of your breathing is one of the most important parts of scuba diving.

One thing you absolutely need to understand is that when people are in panic mode, no matter how experienced they may be or claim to be, they can make very rash, very dangerous decisions. \n\nPlenty of expert divers have rushed to the surface, completely disregarding the risk of nitrogen narcosis in a panicked state. Plenty of experts have even died as a result of panicking. Experts. Let me say it again for you. ***Experts have died***. \n\nYour boyfriend was having a panic attack and you pushed him and then argued that he didn't try. That's not up to you to make that decision for him, that he could have still done it. That's is entirely up to him and the diving instructors. \n\nSafety is first priority, always. I think you need to go back and take some more classes on safety ASAP. You may think your heart is in the right place, and in some instances it can be.

They usually also drown themselves too. \n\nSo in panic, your bf wouldn't have known that and possibly drowned.", "OK fair enough, I take that back.", "Have you had a panic attack? Because I have. In fact, I had one while attempting scuba diving in Australia, on my honeymoon. I jumped in, went under, said nope, resurfaced and got back in the boat. One of the crew took me for a snorkel instead once I felt better and pointed out things I would have otherwise missed. It was great. My husband took some pictures underwater to show me, and I lived vicariously through them. No regrets. Panic attacks are scary and you are pushy. Stop it and let him make his own decisions.

Furthermore, people can experience severe claustrophobia underwater.

After probably an hour and a half I started convulsing. Like how your body goes into shock and you just vibrate? I'm really susceptible to that but in the water it was freaky. He didn't really want to get out yet so he asked me to try a little longer. We linked arms and both used our free arm to float around but when I was done, we were done. \n\nI tend to over panic and he's never pushed me to a point where I regret it.

When we did try again for the shallow water snorkel, it was because WE felt okay in the calmer waters, and we still basically held onto a floatie that one of the instructors had and just put our faces in the water.

The problem with panicking is that I don't know if it's a one off event or if you're prone to it or what if it can triggered by something else. No diver in the history of diving has ever died from making a single mistake, it's usually one mistake creates a problem that creates another problem which causes a mistake and keeps compounding until it takes more time to fix than you have air left which is why panicking especially deeper is a death sentence more times than not. Also I still dive with my buddies that panicked just never that deep, they don't mind because they prefer not going that deep any more.

There are many things that make panic under water a very dangerous thing.", "Oh that\u2019s been VERY clear.", "Panic attacks are horrible. They make you feel like you're dying and like there's no way out. Your body feels heavy, your breathing gets harsh and difficult, your heart is beating out of your chest, you get nauseous, ect. Having that while underwater sounds absolutely terrifying, and your boyfriend was completely right that that could endanger himself or others. \n\n  \nTake this as a learning experience and I hope that it can help you understand it better in the future :)", "Panic attacks are not a trivial matter. Despite people misusing the term to mean any amount of anxiety or panic, panic attacks go beyond mental stress and genuinely make you feel as if your heart is about to stop and you can't breathe. Countless people go to  the ER mistaking them for heart attacks. Imagine that while under the water with a limited air supply.", "I\u2019ve had panic attacks so bad that I couldn\u2019t sit upright. My body was too weak to hold me. And it\u2019s not uncommon for people to go to the hospital thinking they\u2019re having a heart attack only to be told that they\u2019re actually having a panic attack.\n\nIf he truly felt like a panic attack was coming on, it would be incredibly dangerous for him to be in the water, let alone underwater. He might regret not trying something, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019d rather live with that regret than have a full blown panic attack and not enjoy the activity plus be put in danger.", "So you're young and inexperienced. \n\nPeople have panic attacks over all kind of things. It's estimated that 1 in 20 people have panic attacks. You seem to think that's 1) insignificant and 2) that you can cure it.\n\nNot so.\n\nSome people do not even know they're going to have one, until they do. I'm not afraid of heights (but my partner is even less afraid of heights). But I'm afraid of deep water activities (having grown up on a beach, with waves, with drownings - my best friend's athletic and brave father died when she was 14, along with two of his friends - of a group of 10 in the water). \n\nA friend's fianc\u00e9e drowned scuba diving (dive operator was eventually held legally responsible). \n\nDo you live near an ocean? Because I could keep going. My ocean is the Pacific (which has a pretty good plunge off the continental shelf, with all kinds of hazards).", "Here's a rundown of what my panic attacks are like;\n\n1.) Creeping sense of dread. Can escalate to feeling like I am literally about to die.\n\n2.) Shortness of breath. Not exactly ideal for swimming. And would DEFINITELY be exacerbated by being compressed by a wetsuit. Claustrophobic environments, even in people who don't have claustrophobia, often make panic worse.\n\n3.) Chest pain. Again, not ideal.\n\n4.) Muscle weakness. Definitely not compatible with the ocean under any circumstances.\n\n5.)  (it's right in the name) Panic! I'm not exactly at my decision-making peak during a panic attack. So it's best to avoid potentially life-threatening decisions. Like the ones you'd encounter while diving.\n\n6.) Non-verbal. Sometimes during a panic attack I can't speak. Inability to clearly communicate is a huge liability while diving. Especially when you're supposed to be learning the ropes.\n\n7.) Finally, there's the aftermath. The Panic-Attack Hangover, if you will. I usually feel shitty for a minimum of a day, maximum of about a week after a panic attack. Weak, tired, shaky, emotional, jumpy... Just generally not at my best. A panic attack basically puts your whole system on alert, it's extremely taxing emotionally, mentally, and physically. It's essentially a full-body workout against your will, and also you feel like you're under the looming shadow of death while you're at it.\n\nEveryone experiences panic attacks differently, but these are some of the symptoms you can expect. You can see why a lot of these would be extremely detrimental to downright life-threatening in the water. I understand you were trying to be supportive, but you ended up doing the opposite. I'd recommend a sincere apology and an attempt at educating yourself, and communicating to come up with a plan for the next time this happens.", "Not an exaggeration. They teach you this in lifeguarding, too. If you can\u2019t get the person to calm down and stop thrashing in the water, you have to gauge whether saving them is worth risking them pulling you under and drowning you, too. A panicked person working off pure adrenaline can drown even a strong, experienced lifeguard.", "It's generally that dangerous to be that close to a panicked person in water. People panicking in a swimming pool have been known to drown would-be rescuers. The instinct is GET OUT OF THE WATER and overrides any logic or safety (like don't climb the lifeguard like they're a tree). It's why water rescue usually involves floatation devices. You give them an inanimate object to climb/cling to, then figure out how to get them out. \n\nAnd that's without the whole compressed gas/having to surface at a specific speed/risk of blood gas imbalance/submerged/etc that scuba introduces.", "It\u2019s that dangerous. They can not only kill themselves, but take you with them. There are many things that can go wrong and panic makes them much more likely to happen.", "This was really beautiful to read. You\u2019re very lucky to have such a wonderful, patient partner, it sounds like you compliment each other well.", "A family friend used to be a diver for an oil rig. Something happened on a dive to repair a piece on the underwater section of the rig, not too clear on details, but he was deep; around 250-300 feet. He panicked or went too deep, the other divers barely managed to get him up and he spent two weeks in a pressure chamber. Was never the same afterwards. And this was someone who had been diving 20+ years so he was very experienced.", "Tbf a lot of experienced scuba divers also probably go missing doing things pushing themselves too far bc they are overconfident and get themselves into a bad situation, not bc they have a panic attack necessarily. Like underwater cave diving is a huge no-no, but that probably doesnt stop people from pushing it. Just like people ignoring signs walking close to the mouth of a volcano after walking up a mountain. And only experienced divers would have the chance to try something like that, it not like beginners can just wander off into a deep sea cave", "Thank god for the fact correction", "They never said it was pure oxygen. Oxygen is the limiting factor in that compressed air.", "I mentioned this in my comment as well, about scuba training explicitly stating that one should not scuba if they have any reason to believe they will panic. I\u2019m confused about what OP learned from her instruction that made her believe pushing a panicking person to continue was the right call \ud83e\uddd0", "My husband possums people and he said people are nervous but a few he could just tell they were about to have a panic attack so they didn't go and stayed on the plane.  Don't push people.", "you went skydiving once and then went straight to BASE jumping?!?!", "Yas! I could barely breathe during the free fall, which I thought I'd love, but I couldn't wait for him to pull the cord.", "I tried skydiving and I didn't hate it,but I felt no need to do it again. Like, I was Meh.", "For me, after the initial jump or tumble out of the plane, it felt like floating. I loved it but won't do it again because I hate little airplanes. I got sick on the ride up but was fine as soon as I was out of the plane. I'll stick with Sky Zone.", "Same with my partner. Learning how to positively encourage and support is key.", "Yeah, the fact that OP thinks they are similar is not only concerning, it paints a picture in which OP consistently gives her partner internal criticism for being more cautious (and prone to panic attacks).", "The thought of having a panic attack wearing scuba gear almost triggered me to spiral myself.", "It also triggers a powerful flight instinct in most people I\u2019ve known which could be very dangerous under water.", "Just like it's not logical to expect other people to like and enjoy everything that oneself likes and enjoys.", "Having no experience doesn\u2019t excuse them from being an asshole", "When I took a liveguard course they told us it was common to pop the person in the face with your rescue can. That would either make them stop thrashing or knock them out so you can perform rescue.", "Yeah, he probably suffered some brain damage. Diving is no joke. You have to remain calm to survive. If you can't remain calm, you cannot safely dive.", "As well as nature being nature having an effect. Undercurrents. Animals. Medical episodes. Making stupid decisions. \n\nThere are several reasons why something could happen. Some of them may be partially or fully the fault of one or more people, others are not able to be avoided.", "Yup. CNS toxicity underwater is a fairly horrendous way to go...", "LOL", "I was actually halfway submerged in the ocean with my Pure Oxygen ready to descend until I read OP's comment. He saved my life.", "I doubt they were getting into the messy details of partial pressures...", "IT'S CALLED POSSUMING?!?!?! *incredible*", "Especially out of a plane.", "Today I learned . . .", "Gotta admit I felt that sweat above my lip starting and bailed on imagining it.", "Thank you!!!!! Peer pressure isn\u2019t foreign to anyone under 30 and OP sounds apathetic and full of herself. I have almost drowned before and I hope OP\u2019s boyfriend runs away. She is so cavalier about **underwater panic.** perfect combo of idiocy and apathy", "I just can sympathize with OP because I've been in a similar situation before. Water wasn't involved so it wasn't nearly as dire, but the first time I saw my friend have a panic attack (I think I was 18 or 19, so not too much younger than OP) I 100% had no idea what was going on or how to react. I tried to calm her down but didn't know what to say and wasn't helping at all. Ended up just stepping away and giving her space because I could tell I was fucking up and felt horrible. After she had calmed down she explained to me how panic attacks worked and what to do in the future if it happens (definitely different for everyone, some people need space, some need comfort etc.) and I apologized profusely. We moved on from it quite well and the next time she had a panic attack I was more prepared to support her the way she needed.\n\nNow I have my own panic attacks, so that sucks.", "Yeah if you aren't certified to sky dive on your own you're strapped to a certified person's stomach and they control the parachute.  You're (edit: the certified person) on their back so possuming.  I doubt that's the official name but everyone calls it that.", "My (very Midwestern US) family handles my stupid and totally irrational butterfly phobia with more grace than OP handled their partner's rational fear. (It's how loud the wings are, man. That and a weird recurring nightmare I had as a kid.)", "Yup yup that\u2019s as far as I got", "Tandem skydiving.", "i was aware of the concept just not that it was called something so frickin silly!", "Because the little possums ride on their mama! That\u2019s so cute :)", "Good to know I'm not the only one that noped out. \ud83e\udec2", "That's what I figured but wasn't sure.", "100% prefer to call it \"possuming\" now!", " tantric skydiving", "Because the mother possum carries the baby on her back", "Learning when to nope out is how I\u2019ve been able to avoid panic attacks for the most part. Sometimes they sneak up on you though."]}
