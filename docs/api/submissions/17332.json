If Lacey can\u2019t get her way, she\u2019ll throw a tantrum and try to forcibly take what she wants. My grandma feels bad and has kind of just allowed it at this point.\n\nYesterday, we celebrated Mother\u2019s Day the same way we do every year, which is cooking a meal at my grandma\u2019s house to celebrate her since she\u2019s a mom in all our lives. I baked some homemade cookies for both grandma and my own mom.\n\nWe hung out in the backyard, since that\u2019s where my parents and uncle were barbecuing and preparing dinner. While we were outside, Lacey opened both my packs of cookies and threw them away because she thinks that raisins are gross.\n\nWhen we sat down to eat inside, Lacey was whining because she had broken her phone during an earlier tantrum that day and my grandma asked her to wait until tomorrow to take it to the repair store.\n\nLacey wasn\u2019t happy with that response because she wanted a new phone right then. She started throwing stuff and ended up knocking a painting my sister made for our mom into their dog\u2019s water bowl. The painting is mostly intact but now one of the corners has water damage.\n\nMy sister started crying because she worked so hard on that painting. She even saved up a lot of her own money to be able to afford special supplies and surprise our mom with it. Lacey rolled her eyes when she saw my sister crying and told her to grow up.\n\nI started to scream back at Lacey. Lacey yelled at my sister to just make a new painting for our mom and that hers isn\u2019t even around. I yelled at Lacey that she needs to stop using the fact that she has a bad mom as an excuse, because it sucks to have bad parents but it\u2019s not an excuse.\n\nI admit I am probably the asshole for what I said next, but I was so frustrated with Lacey that I then told her that this is why we don\u2019t like her and hasn\u2019t she ever wondered why we always try to get out of family events if we know she is going to be there. Lacey looked stunned and ran to her room.\n\nMy grandma, uncle, and aunt defended Lacey, saying that she\u2019s barely even a teenager and that I am almost 17 and need to apologize. But my parents defended me and my mom told grandma that she needs to send Lacey to a counselor. \n\nI know that I went too far with my words, but at the same time, I\u2019m just so sick and tired of the way Lacey acts. My friends agreed that my grandma isn\u2019t doing Lacey any favors but that it\u2019s really not my business.

Her parenting style with Lacey seems to be greatly influenced by guilt. I imagine Grandma let negative behavior slide when Lacey was little because she felt bad about Lacey's situation. Probably felt that being an authoritative parent figure to Lacey was \"mean\". Unfortunately it sounds like Grandma is not willing to acknowledge how unhealthy the dynamic is. So change will never happen. \n\nIt sounds like its time for your family (you, sister, and parents) to have an after dinner meeting.

You have diagnosed autism without any more info than a few paragraphs, and have linked it to smoking/drug taking in pregnancy, without any supporting evidence at all.\nThat's pretty amazing!

You are very right in that Lacey  is barely a teenager.  That means that those who should be guiding her are the ones doing a poor job.

However, you are probably underestimating how much whatever happened with her mum has damaged her, it sounds like there's no dad involved either. Lack of early, secure parental bonds can really do a number on how peoples brain's develop. Also, I doubt it's a coincidence that she destroyed the things you and your sister made for your mum. Mother's day is probably a really hard day for her. \n\nBut, that doesn't make the things she does any less hurtful. And you don't have to have your feelings discredited because she's had a shitty start to life. It's completely unfair that they're excusing her behaviour due to age when you're only 2 years older & are expected to have perfect emotional control. You are allowed to react when people hurt you & call them out on their behaviour, even if you understand there might be underlying causes behind the behaviour. I've worked with a lot of teenagers with behavioural difficulties over the years & even as an adult and an experienced professional it can be very hard not to let your emotions get the better of you. You're 16, you're allowed to have outbursts sometimes & you've had years of this BS. \n\nYour mum is right, I'm sure your Grandma is doing her best but she needs to let someone help you cousin because atm your cousin is on the path to being a permanent AH & having a miserable, angry life & your Grandma can't sort it alone.

Yikes.\n\nYour mom's right, this kid needs therapy.  She also needs some boundaries and consequences and oh boy is she not getting any of those.  It's really *not* doing her any favors.

It sounds like your family is enabling this type of behavior because she\u2019s \u201cbarely even a teenager\u201d or that they feel sorry for her not having a mother around. That does NOT give her the right to be an AH to you or your sister. She pushed and you, figuratively, shoved her back. What was she expecting? To walk all over you like she can with other family members? It certainly sounds like your cousin needs to see a counselor/therapist if she is constantly using her bad mom as an excuse each time. Either she is using this as a way to manipulate the family into giving her whatever she wants, or it\u2019s some kind of cry for attention, that should not give her preferential treatment. 14 or no, she needs to learn discipline and respect and realize her actions and behavior are NOT going to be tolerated.", "NTA. you are 16, which may be 2 years away from an adult but also only 2 years older than lacey. if you need to be mature, so should she.\n\ni'm just curious, but how old is your sister? i'm assuming she's at least a year younger than you and if so, lacey is even more of an asshole. why does lacey get to act like a bratty child but apparently your sister should just suck it up and you shouldn't defend her?", "NTA. Should have called her Veruca.", "NTA. Unfortunately, she needs a reality check and therapy.  \nThey might be trying to downplay her actions, but she's less than 4 years away from real adult consequences to her actions.  Throwing and breaking someone else's things like that could land her in jail.", "It's quite possible that's why Lacey's mom turned out that way. She's well on her way to bring a mini-egg donor.", "If that\u2019s her Grandma\u2019s best then the cousin would be better off with anyone else."]}
