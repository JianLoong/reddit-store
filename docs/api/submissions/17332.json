She started throwing stuff and ended up knocking a painting my sister made for our mom into their dog\u2019s water bowl. The painting is mostly intact but now one of the corners has water damage.\n\nMy sister started crying because she worked so hard on that painting.

Lacey yelled at my sister to just make a new painting for our mom and that hers isn\u2019t even around. I yelled at Lacey that she needs to stop using the fact that she has a bad mom as an excuse, because it sucks to have bad parents but it\u2019s not an excuse.\n\nI admit I am probably the asshole for what I said next, but I was so frustrated with Lacey that I then told her that this is why we don\u2019t like her and hasn\u2019t she ever wondered why we always try to get out of family events if we know she is going to be there. Lacey looked stunned and ran to her room.\n\nMy grandma, uncle, and aunt defended Lacey, saying that she\u2019s barely even a teenager and that I am almost 17 and need to apologize. But my parents defended me and my mom told grandma that she needs to send Lacey to a counselor. \n\nI know that I went too far with my words, but at the same time, I\u2019m just so sick and tired of the way Lacey acts.
