I totally understand all the Y T As, but I want to know is how you asked her out multiple times. Like, for instance, if the first time you said something like \"want to grab dinner monday?\" And she replied that she couldn't, I don't think asking her later about a different day is wrong, since the reason given was that the day you asked about didn't work for her. On the other hand, if she replied saying she wasn't interested, or you asked about going out in general and she said no, asking again IS creep behavior. Not taking no for an answer is a problem, but if you just weren't picking up on hints and genuinely thought she might be interested if it wasn't the day she said she couldn't, it's a different situation. \n\nNot accepting a no and then moving in across from her is definitely creepy, but asking twice about two separate dates on the calendar and then moving to an open flat across from her is a bit different I think. \n\nThat's all assuming you genuinely only asked twice at max, truly moved there for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with her, and haven't misrepresented anything here. You wouldn't be an asshole for seeming like a creep, but if any of that isn't the case, you don't just seem like one. You're being one. \n\nAnd before I get downvoted for this, I'd like anybody else reading this comment to think about this; if it really is a coincidence, and he just seems like a creep due to an unfortunate combination of events, does that really make him an asshole? Looking like an asshole from the outside is different from actually being one, and I think some people on here are voting without considering that. Like the top comment right now even says there might be an innocent explanation but still votes Y T A. If there is an innocent explanation wouldn't it be N A H? Because her response would be totally reasonable given the information she has, but OP also didn't do anything? Again, though, that's all assuming there is an innocent explanation, and only OP knows that for sure, so I dont want to speculate. \n\nOP, Y T A if you didn't take no for an answer or didn't genuinely move there for reasons unrelated to being near her, but if you really moved there for separate reasons and just look bad in this situation that doesn't make you an asshole. Either way, she isn't the asshole either though, because from the outside it's totally reasonable to assume you're a creep.", "exactly. dude could\u2019ve turned his desk away from the window but he CHOSE to do it to where he has direct visibility. very weird behavior.", "Right??
