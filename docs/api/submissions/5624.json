I totally understand all the Y T As, but I want to know is how you asked her out multiple times. Like, for instance, if the first time you said something like \"want to grab dinner monday?\" And she replied that she couldn't, I don't think asking her later about a different day is wrong, since the reason given was that the day you asked about didn't work for her. On the other hand, if she replied saying she wasn't interested, or you asked about going out in general and she said no, asking again IS creep behavior. Not taking no for an answer is a problem, but if you just weren't picking up on hints and genuinely thought she might be interested if it wasn't the day she said she couldn't, it's a different situation. \n\nNot accepting a no and then moving in across from her is definitely creepy, but asking twice about two separate dates on the calendar and then moving to an open flat across from her is a bit different I think. \n\nThat's all assuming you genuinely only asked twice at max, truly moved there for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with her, and haven't misrepresented anything here. You wouldn't be an asshole for seeming like a creep, but if any of that isn't the case, you don't just seem like one. You're being one. \n\nAnd before I get downvoted for this, I'd like anybody else reading this comment to think about this; if it really is a coincidence, and he just seems like a creep due to an unfortunate combination of events, does that really make him an asshole? Looking like an asshole from the outside is different from actually being one, and I think some people on here are voting without considering that. Like the top comment right now even says there might be an innocent explanation but still votes Y T A. If there is an innocent explanation wouldn't it be N A H? Because her response would be totally reasonable given the information she has, but OP also didn't do anything? Again, though, that's all assuming there is an innocent explanation, and only OP knows that for sure, so I dont want to speculate. \n\nOP, Y T A if you didn't take no for an answer or didn't genuinely move there for reasons unrelated to being near her, but if you really moved there for separate reasons and just look bad in this situation that doesn't make you an asshole. Either way, she isn't the asshole either though, because from the outside it's totally reasonable to assume you're a creep.", "exactly. dude could\u2019ve turned his desk away from the window but he CHOSE to do it to where he has direct visibility. very weird behavior.", "Right??

Most of my gamer friends don't want direct sunlight when they are playing games so I think that wanting to look outside while gaming is a weak excuse.

Instead of taking that gracefully, you're making comments like \"she knows where to find me\". Yeah, trust me, she does cause it sounds like you don't leave her alone lol. She doesn't want to find you buddy. Get that into your head.\n\nThat would be bad. But you decide to rent across from her. **KNOWINGLY** rent across from her.\n\nOnce again, you could have been graceful about it. But you, purposefully it seems, decided not to be.\n\nDid you approach her and say \"Hey, I found a really great place, but its right across from you. I hope that's ok?\" before you signed? Or even \"Hey, I found a place across from you, I'm moving in on day, I just wanted to let you know\" or something.\n\nNaw. You just did it, under the guise of \"it's a great place\". Sureeeee.\n\nOk fine. You don't *really* have to let people know where you're moving. I could see that argument. It would have been the **smart** and **sensible** thing to do. But you didn't.\n\n**However** you don't have to sit there at your battlestation, staring outside at her house like a super creep. All I can picture is some dude sitting behind a monitor, facing a bay window, with his head occasionally peeking around it staring at his neighbours place. It does not cut a flattering picture. Seriously. \n\nAlso. It's not your fault she doesn't use curtains? Yah, but it is **your fault** you don't. Which, by the way, is where your whole \"I'm just gaming\" thing falls apart. So you directly face out the big bright bay window while gaming? You don't get the sun in your eyes? All that light doesn't wash out your monitor? Give me a break. Anyone who games keeps their curtains closed and prefers a dark room over a bright one with a bay window. \"plenty of people do that\" No. They don't. Gaming rooms are always darker for better picture. I've been gaming a long time and run a serious PC setup right now. And the last thing I would do when setting up my gaming setup, is do it right in front of a big bright ass bay window. It would make everything look like shit.\n\nEVEN IF you like having washed out picture and the sun right in your eyes as you game. Doesn't change the fact you could close the curtain too. She doesn't like curtains, apparently, but so what, you don't either? Yeah right. You could close it and give her an iota of comfort but you refuse to.\n\nYou could have done so many things differently moving into this place and you wouldn't have been labelled a creep. You could have just quietly moved in, closed the curtains, and never interacted with her. And I guarantee she would have never complained. She might not have even realized you moved in across the street.\n\nNah. Instead you spend your spare time gaming and staring at her house. Yeah. That's creepy dude.\n\nSo. To reiterate. You aren't the asshole cause you rented a flat across from her. You're the asshole because:\n\nYou won't leave her alone about dating you.\n\nYou moved in across the street without even telling her (if I was going to move in next to someone I know, I'd tell them anyways).\n\nYou purposefully set up your gaming setup so you can stare at her house while you game.\n\nYou refuse to close your own curtains (and really, this is the big one that shows you're lying. No one wants a bright ass room to game in. Be honest).\n\nSo yes. She is going around and saying you're a creep and a stalker because you are acting like one.\n\nI would love for you go to HR on this. Especially looking at your other comments. Like how you weren't invited to her birthday despite her inviting coworkers, but went with a mate who was invited? SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU THERE. OR SHE WOULD HAVE INVITED YOU WITH THE OTHER COWORKERS.\n\nLeave this poor woman alone. Jesus dude. You sound unhinged.", "YTA.

There is no getting away from the fact you now come across as a crazy stalker.\n\nYou should have told her that you were applying for the place\u2026and frankly looked for one that didn\u2019t look in her windows.

I was even bothered when my boss put my desk next to his; guys you have to tell no more than once to don't respect you or your boundaries, and to move across from a woman is like pulling your pants down, crouching, and taking a massive dump all over her boundaries. \"I know you don't want to date me, but now I have the ability to watch you in your home while off the clock. I've inserted myself into your safe, personal space and made it unsafe and no longer private.\" I don't give a damn about the no blinds comment, nobody wants their male coworker they rejected watching them unwind in their home.
