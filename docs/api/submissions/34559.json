There is no assigned street parking on my street -- if you can find a spot to park, you can park there.\n\nBecause the space between houses is minimal, the street parking between my driveway and my next door neighbor's driveway can accommodate either one or two vehicles, depending on the size of vehicle parked there. Often, I will see just a single vehicle in the middle. This seems to frustrate one of my neighbors, because it leaves a possible parking spot on a busy street inaccessible.\n\nIf this said neighbor, with whom I have never spoken to, sees a parking spot near my driveway available, she will park her large SUV such that the front tire is at my driveway line, completely leaving her front bumper blocking my driveway. It could be because she is trying not to be \"that person\" taking up two street parking spots when parking is already scarce, but I don't know for sure. But, when she chooses to park in this spot, she parks like this CONSTANTLY, even if the space behind her is available. I should clarify that I often see her car parked a few houses east, leading me to believe she lives a few houses away. But since I have never spoken to this lady, I have no idea which house exactly. I have only ever seen her getting into and out of the car.\n\nWhile I can still get my car out when blocked like this, it's more challenging and dangerous, given that a large SUV is now obstructing my view of oncoming traffic to a relatively busy residential street. \n\nI've been giving her the benefit of the doubt for a few months, hoping maybe she will realize she's parked improperly upon returning to her vehicle and be more considerate next time. But nothing has changed. On one particularly poor parking day (as in worse than most days), I got fed up and called the city telling them a car had been parked blocking my driveway. I gave them a location and they said they would try to investigate. \n\nA few hours later, I look out the window to see they have a brand new parking ticket on their windshield.\n\nI don't know if it will change anything, but I do feel a bit petty for taking this kind of action rather than trying to work it out in person (or at least through a note left on the windshield).
