There is no assigned street parking on my street -- if you can find a spot to park, you can park there.\n\nBecause the space between houses is minimal, the street parking between my driveway and my next door neighbor's driveway can accommodate either one or two vehicles, depending on the size of vehicle parked there. Often, I will see just a single vehicle in the middle. This seems to frustrate one of my neighbors, because it leaves a possible parking spot on a busy street inaccessible.\n\nIf this said neighbor, with whom I have never spoken to, sees a parking spot near my driveway available, she will park her large SUV such that the front tire is at my driveway line, completely leaving her front bumper blocking my driveway. It could be because she is trying not to be \"that person\" taking up two street parking spots when parking is already scarce, but I don't know for sure. But, when she chooses to park in this spot, she parks like this CONSTANTLY, even if the space behind her is available. I should clarify that I often see her car parked a few houses east, leading me to believe she lives a few houses away. But since I have never spoken to this lady, I have no idea which house exactly. I have only ever seen her getting into and out of the car.\n\nWhile I can still get my car out when blocked like this, it's more challenging and dangerous, given that a large SUV is now obstructing my view of oncoming traffic to a relatively busy residential street. \n\nI've been giving her the benefit of the doubt for a few months, hoping maybe she will realize she's parked improperly upon returning to her vehicle and be more considerate next time. But nothing has changed. On one particularly poor parking day (as in worse than most days), I got fed up and called the city telling them a car had been parked blocking my driveway. I gave them a location and they said they would try to investigate. \n\nA few hours later, I look out the window to see they have a brand new parking ticket on their windshield.\n\nI don't know if it will change anything, but I do feel a bit petty for taking this kind of action rather than trying to work it out in person (or at least through a note left on the windshield).

Don't confront a random neighbor because you have no idea how they will react and if they are armed (I'm in the US).", "NTA.  Everyone knows the rules about parking and driveways.", "NTA\n\nA parking ticket is much more kind than a tow and people are very pro-tow in these situations", "NTA\nThey wouldn't have written the ticket if it wasn't over the line.", "NTA, however I would've left a handwritten letter on her windshield prior, asking her to not obstruct your driveway in a kind manner, if she continues to do it then call the authorities. Either way she'll stop. Being petty is only entertaining when it's free, paying a fine will change her behavior regardless. At least you know if there's any vandalism to your property over the next few months who'd be responsible. I'd probably install a security camera in the driveway/front door area just to CYA. There's a significant chance she won't even know you reported it, for all she knows an officer was driving through the area and noticed it themselves. Traffic ticketing is good revenue in dense cities, after all.", "Consider yourself a karmic agent.

I second the warning not to confront the neighbor. You never know how someone will react.  The only thing you know about them is that they are entitled and disrespectful.\n\nI had a similar issue. I had to call the police a number of times. I was talking to one officer and apologized for calling him. I explained that these people just wouldn't learn.\n\nHe dismissed my apology, stating that he was a teacher and his ticket book was his tool.

There is no excuse for someone blocking a driveway other than pure laziness to find a better parking spot.  When someone clearly blocks a driveway, there is no need to inform them ahead of time that what they are doing could result in a ticket.  They already know that and just decided they don't care/they'll take that chance.  Your neighbor took that chance and lost.  Boo Hoo! Hopefully a ticket will be an sufficient incentive not to do it again.", "Perhaps leaving a non-confrontational note on her windshield would be a NTA action that might make further escalation unnecessary?", "NTA. That's why we have parking enforcement.", "NTA. Can\u2019t believe you put up with it for as long as you did. I would have called the first time I saw it blocking my driveway.", "NTA\n\nHopefully she learns. If not, call again.", "You really should have tried to talk to her first. Even if it was just a politely worded note on her car windscreen. She can\u2019t read your mind, and while you were patiently \u2018tolerating\u2019 it she was oblivious.   \n\n\nNext time leave a note \u201cHey neighbour, do you mind parking a foot or two further back, I can\u2019t easily get around your bumper and see into the oncoming traffic.

Seems like it could have saved you both a lot of trouble.", "Info: did you try to initiate contact/leave a note before calling for the ticket? Only reason I ask is because you mentioned she may have good intentions by leaving room for a second car. Also, would your view of oncoming traffic still be obstructed if she moved back the extra couple feet?", "YTA. As you acknowledge, you could have communicated your issue to her directly before involving the authorities. And you could have done so the first few times it happened, instead of waiting for months as you got more and more frustrated and she figured no one cared. It could have been a friendly two minute conversation.", "YTA for not just saying something about it.  You literally think she is doing it to make space for another car, so you know she isn't being an asshole on purpose.\n\nIdiots on here saying you shouldn't confront a neighbor.

You could\u2019ve just spoken to her first. She could\u2019ve had very good intentions of making parking better for the whole road by parking this way.

It\u2019s one of those situations where if you know you know. My situation is that my neighbour is lazy and cheeky and parks in my drive (when it\u2019s empty) to drop things / people off. They\u2019re only there for a few mins but it\u2019s infuriating. It\u2019s my drive (just like it\u2019s your curb) so stay tf off. I would however start by talking to your neighbour first but I guess that ship has sailed. But nonetheless, NTA", "If your street has these sorts of parking problems, perhaps you need to talk to the city about having parking spaces marked on the road. That should prevent the \"asshole parking in the middle of two spots\" problem, and also prevent the \"optimistic person thinks they can squeeze in to the gap but can't\" problem.", "NTA. My neighbor runs a business out of a bus on the street. He has people parking everywhere at all times of the day. A couple of days ago, one of his customers parked too far toward my driveway. He immediately told them to move their car back so that I could get out. We've only had this happen a couple of times. The first time, my husband went over there, and they moved the car. Luckily, we've spoken with them before, so it's not a big deal.", "Very soft YTA for not at least trying a note first and immediately going to the police especially when it isn't in fact blocking you in.  Now, if you had left a note and it happened again, I would have contacted police or had it towed or whatever.", "NTA if she\u2019s blocking part of your driveway, she deserved a parking ticket. If this is a continuous thing, I think I would\u2019ve left a note 1st, before calling the parking authority, but I don\u2019t think you were out of line to do so.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBut there were better ways to handle it. Oh well.\n\nAlso, what city do you live in that the cops will respond to a minor parking problem. I'm amazed.", "NTA. You should put up some of those reflective markers indicating the boundaries of your driveway. She probably can\u2019t tell how far front she is in her giant SUV.", "NTA\n\nI park my car on the street of an extremely dense city - I make sure I am never into the cut which is considered blocking the driveway here.  People do get red painted on their edges and I will block the red but since most driveway owners just want to get their cars in and out they don't call unless there is a real issue.\n\nYou have described a real issue.  Sure it would be neighborly to let the owner of the car know, with a note, that they are blocking your driveway and to please make sure not to in the future...but you don't know how they will react.  People can be nice (I have gotten one such a note and I blame parking when overly tired) or they can be wrathful.", "NTA \n\nCould\u2019ve left a bite first though.", "NTA, but leaving a note first would have been nicer.", "A note pointing out the fact that she was obstructing your view would not have been out of line. There is the possibility she did not know. You are a soft ah", "Don't bother engaging with these people.  Then they know who called.  You call the city to haul off trash.  This is just the same.", "It could have also gone very wrong and now she knows where OP lives. At this stage of life people know not block any inch of a driveway. If this driver did not know; now she does.", "Won't they be able to guess who called anyway? It's doubtful that someone across the street is going to complain.", "\"Hey, can you stop blocking the driveway? Thanks.\" Pretty hard for that to go wrong.
