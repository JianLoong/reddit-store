{"id": 32910, "submission_id": "18guxhk", "title": "AITA for firing an old roommate?", "selftext": "I (35) lived in shared a house with \u201cAnna\u201d and \u201cKatie\u201d back in our early 20s. It was a beautiful house by the beach, we all got along well, and I considered them my closest friends at the time. I had the master bedroom that I paid more in rent for, while they had smaller rooms and shared a bathroom. A few years into living together, Anna got a promotion at her job and wanted to upgrade rooms, asking me if I had plans to move out as she wanted my room. I didn\u2019t, so she said she started looking into moving somewhere she wouldn\u2019t have to share a bathroom. But after a few months, I started noticing strange things happening in my life. Anna and Katie started distancing from me out of no where, and my friends and parents who lived in another city started calling me saying they are worried I might be addicted to drugs. I was extremely confused as that was not the case. \r  \n\r  \nLater, I found out that Anna has been calling my family and friends behind my back, telling them I have a drug addiction and that they should urge me to move back home with them. Anna has also been telling Katie that I\u2019ve been stealing from her (not true) to fund my \u201csecret drug addiction\u201d. Landlord heard about it and threatened to evict me, and somehow my employer also heard about it, and I almost lost my job. The only reason I didn\u2019t was because my drug test came back squeaky clean. My life kinda went downhill because of the rumors, I had to move out of the house because of how much tension there was, and of course Anna immediately moved into my room. I also lost my job at the time because I couldn\u2019t commute from my new place anymore. Katie moved out shortly after I did as the way Anna (who was the one that was actually stealing) lied about me caused a strain between them. \r  \n\r  \nNow, it\u2019s been about 10 years since I\u2019ve talked to Anna. Turns out she is an employee at the company I work at, and I have a much higher position than her; Anna is the assistant of one of the people I hired and manage. I found out that she hasn\u2019t been doing very well at the job and has been on performance improvements plans a couple times before. I didn\u2019t really have to fire her, but there are reasons I could use if I wanted to so I did. I \u2018revealed\u2019 myself to her afterwards (I have a very common name and she\u2019s never seen me in person at the office) and also have legally covered myself so she can\u2019t challenge her firing. Anna was shocked to say the least, she and I both know exactly what happened and it was a very satisfying moment for me. Anna no kids or dependents but she has a big European trip coming up and I\u2019m sure her getting fired isn\u2019t the best timing. I told my boyfriend about what I did and he said it is an asshole move since it\u2019s been almost a decade and we\u2019re older now so we should let it go and I shouldn\u2019t mess with someone\u2019s livelihood. This girl ruined my life once, and most importantly, betrayed my trust, I am definitely not able to let it go.

And she wasn't doing well at work. Good on you for getting rid of an employee that wasn't up to the task to make room for someone who was. Nice bit of petty revenge to point it out to her after the fact, which I also applaud.", "NTA.  Good for you.  But I would not go around telling folks about it.", "NTA. It's only fair that she receive negative consequences for her behavior. Otherwise, she might go through life thinking it was okay. And that was absolutely fucked up what she did.\n\nI don't even think you were abusing your power by firing her. She has poor performance at work, and you know from experience that she is an awful person with no integrity. You made a determination that this isn't the kind of person that you want representing your company.", "Does this make you TA?  Yes, probably. \n\nWould I do the same thing? Also yes.", "NTA. You knew that she was untrustworthy based on your own personal experience. Added together with her lackluster performance, you had reason for doing what you did. Also, I don\u2019t care if it was 10 or 20 years ago, she\u2019s a liar and basically ruined someone\u2019s life-yours-once, what\u2019s to say that she hasn\u2019t done it since?", "NTA - I was livid when you said \"then I moved out\" because my only thought at that moment was \"you mean you ceded the room to that witch? YOU LET HER WIN?!\"\n\nMan that was a good payoff. Here's the thing, she's a master manipulator, you have evidence of that from your personal life. She's obviously still applying those skills later in life, coasting in her job, causing issues. I'm sure she cried every time those performance improvement plans came up huh?\n\nGood riddance, you did your company a favor by purging a sociopath.", "Anyone thats been put on a PIP MULTIPLE times was getting fired regardless of your history.

I'll lay odds she absolutely has never thought about you for the past 10 years, nor any consequences to your life for her lies.  What is the saying...payback is a bitch??\n\n\nWhy is it that the wronged party is ALWAYS the one that is urged to \"let it go\" and \"be the bigger person\"? The perpetrator is almost never held responsible for their actions.  Well, this time, Anna learned about consequences.  Well done and NTA NTA NTA.", "Info: Did she apologize to you or confess her mistakes from that time or provided some form of information?", "Sweet, Sweet revenge. NTA", "NTA.  Rarely in life do opportunities like this come up.  And the reality is that she was already fucking up at work, so it isn\u2019t like you did what she did and outright lied about her behavior. Revenge is a dish best served cold and you served it.", "NTA. She was already on shakey ground and the fact you knew from personal experience she was toxic via her dishonesty and manipulation is enough to boot her out. If anyone at work gives you serious grief over it, point out to them how much hell she gave you and then ask them if they really want someone like that sticking around as a co-worker.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To be clear the only AH thing you did here was reveal yourself so you could revel in the payback, since the firing was legit.\nYou don\u2019t get opportunities like this much in your life and sometimes you gotta take em, no matter the karma hit.", "ESH, she obviously sucks for her unhinged actions 10 years ago. You suck for firing her for it. People can change a lot in 10 years, and hopefully she did. \n\nBut reddit loves it's scorched earth revenge so I doubt this will be a popular opinion.", "YTA\n\nI totally get, why you did what you did. And honestly, I can't say, whether I wouldn't have been tempted to do the same thing in your position.\n\nBut that doesn't change the facts. What you did was extremely unprofessional.\n\nAnd it was also extremely stupid. You might \"*have legally covered myself so she can\u2019t challenge her firing*\". But if I would be your boss and Anna would tell me all about your story and history together, you would be black-listed for all time. I would not fire you immediately, but only for a lack of legal reasons. I would never trust you again. I would never recommend you for anything, like prestigious projects or the like. I would never promote you any further. I would make sure to control each and every single step of you. I would micro-manage the crap out of you. And eventually, you would hate your job and quit. Would it have been worth it?\n\nYou should have gone to your boss, and tell them \"full disclosure: I've heard nothing good about this employee. But I've got a history with this employee. Therefore I cannot evaluate her. Could we please have someone else do that, to keep everything fair?\" And then Anna would have been fired eventually.", "ESH. Clearly Anna was an AH to you. But this is also a situation where you absolutely should have said \"I cannot be an impartial judge regarding Anna's employment in this situation; I need somebody else to make the decision regarding whether or not her employment should continue.\" Regardless of how bulletproof the case against her is, if she raises a stink about this, it could quite possibly cause your employer to doubt your judgement.", "You fired someone for poor performance. You made it a personal revenge and enjoyed it, which, in a way, she deserved. I would not have made this personal, as it could create some backlash for you at work (considering what Anna did prior, it seems she has no scruples). You should have just been happy with the fact that you were able to fire her and not revel in it. This is not great behavior for management. Unfortunately, Y T A for that (pains me to say this, but it's true). If you had done this without making it a spectacle, my judgement would have been different. Judgement - ESH, except your boyfriend.", "INFO: did you fire her because she's bad at her job, or because you wanted to hurt her?", "YTA and I feel sorry for the people who know you. It seems like you wanted to fire her, not because it\u2019s best for business but because she wronged you a decade ago. Please get therapy.", "Maybe you are TA. But revenge is a dish best served cold and what she did to you was criminal. Well done.", "NTA, que sera sera. :)", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f On top of whatever performance issues she exhibited, you have legitimate concerns about her integrity. NTA.", "NTA.

You know what she is capable of, so wait until she resorts to lying and stealing on the job to try to get what she wants?", "Yep, but she unfortunately revealed herself to Anna.", "This is the most relatable response", "Disagree. There are harmless lies and lies that can have serious consequences. It's not like the lie that was said was when she was a kid and she grew up from it. Would you really trust someone like that in your company. Nta", "Oh she never did. 10 years ago when it happened, I confronted her on the lies she told and her exact words were 'not my problem your mom believed me so easily'.", "Justified Assholes should get an NTA tag. See sidebar.", "I agree with your reasoning.", "Agreed. OP probably does have legitimate grounds to have Anna fired, but if Anna complains it'll muddy the waters and force OP to prove no no, had I done nothing she absolutely positively 100% would've still  been fired.", "Yea a psycho with a lot of free time suddenly is never good", "NTA\nI may even call you a legend. Oh how karma works!!! I don't care if it was an asshole or childish move, the devastation you felt never left and she literally ruined your life and moved on without a single once of regret?? Hell no. I think you dodged a bullet. Who knows what she'd cook at this stage. Please make sure to record calls with her and save texts as proof of her disgusting endeavours. I hope her bf and friends get to see this aspect and actually make her repent her actions."]}
