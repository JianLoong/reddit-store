That means that when things get worse, they are going to be the ones there to take care of you, and they really should be aware and able to prepare for that.\n\nI understand that you don't want to hurt them, and you don't want to have to console them when you are going through it, but I do feel like it's important to sit them down and have a conversation about it.", "You have a right to keep this information private. I would encourage you to find a therapist and work out how to communicate with your family your end of life desires--that you don't want to be the one to help them cope, you just want to be able to enjoy the time you have. But that is entirely up to you.\n\nHowever,  putting the burden of this secret on your 17 year old sibling is wrong.

However, you chose to give up your independence and move back in with your parents and so you now have limited that freedom. You are living in their house, they clearly love and care about you and, as you are living there, it is there right to know about your deteriorating health. \n\nYou cannot move in and just expect to die there without warning and preparing them first. Whilst the situation is tragic, that choice would be the ultimate selfish act and would likely leave them with a lot of anger, hurt, blame and resentment once you pass.\n\nDealing with terminal illness is tough and you are likely going through your own grief at the moment. However, it does not give you the right to make selfish decisions that ultimately negatively impact those around you.\n\nYour sister is right, sit them down and tell your family. Then plan some fun stuff together so that you can all make memories that they can reflect on with tears of joy rather than anger and frustration.

It's way too personal and particular to your individual situation.\n\nI would encourage you to do things to make the last year of your life the best it can be. Starting therapy ASAP is a good idea. And, quite honestly, telling your parents seems like a pretty good idea. They're going to start getting ideas sooner or later, so I think it's probably better to share that information than keep it to yourself. I don't mean to put pressure on you, but based on having a few friends and family members who have passed at a young age from terminal illness (cancer), the overwhelming theme I've experienced is that it's better to go through this with people supporting you than on your own.\n\nI'm not a therapist. I don't know you. I'm so sorry this happened. My advice, if it's worth anything, is that you still have a valuable life to live. It's not your burden to care for others who are getting this news. You have to trust the people who love you to do the right thing and be there for you.", "I don't think there's a right answer here. \n\nI can understand why you would want to keep it to  yourself, at least for a while. You are still coming to terms with everything, and you have that right. \n\nOn the flip side of that, I can see where she's coming from too. If my child or close family member was terminally ill and only had a short time left with us, I'd want to know. I would want to be able to support them in any way I could and prepare myself for what was coming. \n\nOnce you are gone, they will spend the rest of their lives missing you and wondering what more than could have done if they'd have only known.", "YTA. Your parents and loved ones need to know so they can be there for you.\n\nYour sister is right that you are an asshole for not telling your family. \n\nYour family is going to find out soon.

And if your sister knows, please believe she will tell your parents sooner or later. Tell them so that all of you can begin to enjoy the time you have left. Who knows, but your parents will be more understanding of why you moved in and aren't working- and maybe they will all come together to make lasting memories for all of you. I dont want to put this pressure on you but you are the one dying so I guess you don't think about how this will be once you leave. But remember once you are gone, they will still be here and you don't want them to be miserable or in pain wishing they had the opportunity to do things diffrent with you.", "YTA for not telling them. \n\nI see why you haven\u2019t and understand that you\u2019re likely still in some sort of denial about this and want the control/not all the focus to be on the fact you\u2019re dying.

And on top of that, it's way harder to cope with a sudden death out of the blue than one you knew was coming.\n\nIf you love your parents, you'll let them know, even if you're unwilling to change your eventual plans.

And if you still haven't said anything, your parents may be upset that they could have planned things and gone places with you while you were quite well. \n\nIt's impossible to say, but I'd tell your sister that you need two or three weeks to process this before you make the next move, and you'd be grateful if she could support you with that.

You do not know what your last days will be like and what kind of help you might need. Your family also needs the time to adjust to this news. Together, you need to make a plan so they know what you would like to happen. You also need to be realistic about possible pain issues, feeding issues, etc that can come up in final days.

Do I blame him or judge him for his choice? No.\n\nThis is your time. Do what you want. Ignore people calling you \"selfish\". Hell, if there is a time to be selfish, it's now.

I can only say that if my loved one was sick, I would wanna know ASAP so I could support them fully. I would also probably be very upset if they didn't tell me until the end. I can't imagine how difficult of a conversation that would be to have, though. I wish you strength during this time", "I'm going to say NAH because you are dealing with something no one at 23 should have to deal with. You need to tell at least your parents. Right now you need support and if indeed it comes to it, you may need care from those around you. You cannot go through this without help. If you didn't want to tell everyone that is your choice, but your immediate family should be told because they need to be able to deal with this. All of you will be grieving. Right now I think you are a bit shell-shocked, and perhaps a bit in denial, but you need the support of your family more than you've ever needed before so don't delay.", "There\u2019s multiple layers to this. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for not wanting to spend the rest of your time dealing with people\u2019s grief. You have a right to make this time about you and your needs. Go LIVE your life! Hang out with friends and family, travel, take the big risks you were too afraid too! Have fun!!\n\nThat being said, you ATH if you expect your family to support and care for you during this time without telling them why (to them you\u2019re just a lazy kid who quit a good job to mooch off of them). Your sister is right. Eventually you won\u2019t be able to hide it anymore and it will devastate them, and any unkind words spoken will haunt them. \n\nSo make your choice. Either keep your secret and find a way to support yourself and hire a caregiver to help you as your illness progresses, or tell your parents if you expect to continue living at home and have them care for you.\n\nIf you do decide to keep your secret, be kind enough to create a video (first thing we forget is the sound of a loved ones voice, so videos are great gifts), or write a letter to your parents explaining the reason why. They\u2019ll be devastated, and they\u2019ll carry that pain with them for the rest of their lives. They\u2019ll blame themselves thinking they did something wrong and that\u2019s why you never told them. So be kind, and explain somehow why you kept it a secret.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re clearly struggling (as expected). Talk to a therapist. There\u2019s a lot for you to process too. And if you haven\u2019t yet, get a 2nd opinion. Always get a 2nd opinion when it comes to terminal diagnosis.", "NTA because heaven knows how hard this must be for you. Possibly not practical, though, there surely can only be so long you can say you don't want to talk about it before your parents get so worried they start getting really, really pressing with the questions, or they tell your sister they're so worried she cracks and tells them. I wish you the least pain and the most peace possible, I'm so sad for you, but I have lost far too many people far too young to things like cancer and I'd honestly be super tempted to take the same route as you.", "Your family can't force you to do any procedures.

Your sister already knows now, you can't expect her to keep your impending death a secret.  You'll just be making that year one of the most painful ones she'll have to live through because she's losing you, and she can't even talk about it.  Not just that, but I'd assume in the next few months, you will probably begin to visibly deteriorate.  At that point, they're all gonna figure out something is really wrong.  I think if you tell them now, they can spend their last year with you and say and do everything they need to before it's too late.

Let them be involved in making the most of memories. If you don\u2019t want any treatment, tell them.

Please tell me you're not going to just let them find out the hard way after the fact. That would be cruel.", "NAH but you are being selfish. Your parents brought you into this world, raised you, and love you (at least I assume so since you haven't started otherwise). You moved into their home with no explanation, and will get sick which will worry them. Then they will be \"surprised\" when you eventually tell them or die, leaving them with a mess of conflicted emotions to deal with. I get that this is your illness, but like any illness it does affect everyone around you. You are robbing them of time with you. You want to create memories with them, but how will they know to appreciate the time they have left if they don't know? \n\nLet's say for example you decide you want to do a family trip, but they don't prioritize it because they have lives and other things going on. Are you going to be angry that they don't come? Will they be dealing with massive guilt that they didn't because they didn't know?\n\nOn top of that, I think you're naive about the level of care and assistance you'll need from them. My best friend/cousin has been diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer last year, which gives her 2-5 years to live. She started with surgery, which she was in the hospital for a week for. Her memory and cognitive function took a while to come back and even now it's not 100%. Her husband had to take notes at all her appointments to keep track of what was going on, and she wasn't allowed to be alone for 3 weeks. She then had 6 weeks of daily radiation, and due to losing her license (seizures) she had 3 people on a rotating schedule driving her. Since then she is now able to drive and is doing chemo through a pill at home so she is more self sufficient, but the amount of emotional support she recieves is immeasurable. Her treatments ended up moving her to 5 years of life instead of two, and she is about to leave on a month long trip with her husband. \n\nYou're excuse of your parents making you do anything is BS. You have final say on your care, they can't make you do anything. And it will be worse for you if you wait until later to tell them, because then they will be acting more desperate, hurt, and unreasonable. \n\nYour sister will not keep this a secret anyways. No sane person would keep that promise, especially because she will be the one dealing with the aftermath. May as well take control of the situation and tell them yourself. It will go way worse if you don't.\n\nI get that you are probably fairly early into your diagnosis, which is why you are scared to tell anyone. But trust me, you need your village more than ever. It is scary as hell, but after the initial shock wears off, I promise you will be so happy you did. Those last moments will be very lonely without your loved ones. \n\n\nWish you all the best, I hope to see a positive update soon.", "Well, you ahbe to wll them.

Events like this often break families apart - think divorce, depression, substance abuse, etc. Giving them the chance to go through this with you would be an act of kindness.\n\nI get that you're concerned about how your family will react, but there are other solutions for that. You could invite them to a session with a family therapist. You could write them a long letter explaining how you want them to treat you over the next year. You could enilist your sister as an ally in making sure your parents aren't going to be \"too much\".

Just the endless question \"why\" that can never be answered that takes a heavier toll.", "You're exactly right about what her sibling will go thru afterwards..\ud83d\udc4d", "Every sentence out of your mouth telegraphs exactly how little forethought you are putting into this. This isn\u2019t a TV show. You are causing a completely avoidable escalation of your family's trauma. I don\u2019t know if you think you're sparing them or if you're just being dramatic because you're 23, but this is childish and shortsighted. \n\nThis is real. You are dying. Your parents are about to lose a child. This is your death and you are in charge of it but by deliberately lying and denying them a chance to prepare, you are being TA", "I understand you, and your feelings but give them the opportunity to know, so they can do the most of it and saying goodbye to you, they would regret not hugging you everyday not telling you that they love you, all the things they could have done and said only if the knew. Give them the opportunity to be conscious about the situation, even better if they go with you to Switzerland and hold your hand until the very end. \nYou know already there's nothing to do about the illness if they try to convince you about the treatment just say that they need to accept it, as well as you did and end this the most peaceful painless way.\nLots of love, and I hope you enjoy every single second full of happiness and memories behind you. And I really really hope you reconsider telling them, it would change their future and how they will deal with the loss. Also, this is something you could do, programm an email with a video recorded of you talking to them, so after you pass they see that and it's kind of a message from the other side supporting them with the grieving.", "They can\u2019t force you. But also, you should tell them hon. The anguish of losing a child isn\u2019t your burden to bear, but you are making it worse by hiding it and giving them less and less time to cherish with you.\n\nAnd also, you are very young. They very well may have a viable option or perspective that is worth hearing. But regardless, you need to tell them. You will have to sooner or later. Do it now when it has the most return, and for gods sake don\u2019t make your sister hide this from them.", "I think this is pretty irresponsible and selfish and that makes you the AH. The plan, if not for little sis, was to stay silent, book a flight to Switzerland, say goodbye to everyone, and then they never see you again? There's no closure for them? No grave or anything? That's pretty f'd up. You'll be sending them to therapy for years to come. What if they wanted to go with you to Switzerland? Do you know if they are paying for life insurance policies for you? You don't have a job so how are you planning to pay for it all? You need to have the conversation. They need time to process, adjust, grieve, and plan. The longer you wait, that just adds more trauma for them. You can tell them all you want is happiness, and they will do their best to hide their feelings, but they need to be able to talk to you and you to them. This is the time for the family to rally together and make the most of the time precious days you've got left.", "Cancer sucks!", "This. Make everything as easy as you are able. Get everything in writing, pay for what you can, and keep it simple. At 23 they can't make you do anything, but of course they'll want you to. They can't stop you from carrying things out as you want to. No judgement because this is a horrible position to be in.", "Simple. It ***isn't*** ***real***. This is OP's life fanfiction of some sort. So much doesn't add up here, especially her savings and prospective idea of moving to Switzerland to have a silent death.", "Don\u2019t do this. OP knows more about their own medical condition than you do.", "I would be careful about talking to the doctor about the Switzerland plan. Depending on local laws, the doctor might be required by law to report that conversation if OP indicates an intention to take matters into her own hands. Getting an involuntary psych hold won't help OP make the most of their remaining time. OP needs to keep that plan on a 'need to know' basis because people might be legally obligated to interfere with it.", "I\u2019m afraid this burden is too much for your sister to bear. They\u2019ll likely find out she knew and didn\u2019t tell them. They may be angry at her for this (grief blinds the most wise) and she\u2019ll have to carry the guilt of not telling them. There are no winners here, but they love you and they would want to help you through this.", "I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t seen anyone else mention your sister. It would have been better if she didn\u2019t find out but now you\u2019re putting the burden on her to deal with the grief of losing her sister by herself and having her lie by omission. For your sister\u2019s sake you need to tell them, otherwise she won\u2019t be creating any positive memories during this time.", "You can still do that. When my mom told me she had cancer and i knew that she wouldn't survive I hid my pain and tears from her (except 1 time) and we went on make some fantastic memories and i treasure those memories more than any other. I was so grateful for the time i got to spend with her before she died and because we knew her time was short we really did make the most of the time she had left. \nI don't think i could of ever forgiven her if she didn't tell me she was dying because there are always regrets about what could of, should of been said or done.\nThe burden that you have placed on your sister is too heavy for her to carry, please don't do that to her or to yourself. Tell your family and accept their help.", "You can also look into Vermont, that is the current plan for an ill family member.", "It's called MAiD here. I don't know if people who aren't citizens can access it or not. But MAiD is what you will need to look up. \n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/medical-assistance-dying.html\n\nFWIW, I think you should make sure your doctor's know your wishes and sign any medical documents needed to ensure only palliative care rather than life prolonging treatments asap but after that I think you should tell your family. You and your sister (now that she knows) should not have to carry this burden alone and if your capacity goes unexpectedly it will be messy and harder on everyone including and especially you. \n\nSorry to hear this is happening. I hope you find some peace and joy for the time you have left either way.", "If you are from the USA there are a few states that might work. I think Oregon just got rid of the resident requirement.", "Came on to warn you that you may not be able to as you have to be Canadian to receive this. There are a number of states in America though! I saw already you have gotten quite the amount of info though. \n\nPlease do, put yourself in their shoes. Sit then down and have the conversation with them. Let them know what you want and don't want out of the next few months. \nI wish you only the best OP. I truly do.", "I\u2019ve lost several friends to glioblastoma. It\u2019s devastating. I\u2019m sorry you are facing something similar. This isn\u2019t the time to be alone with something so enormous that can really impact your thinking and decision making. Please let the people who love you hold you close as you move through this.", "True, but at least talk to the doctor's about telling the family about it", "Oregon seems like a good option for me.\n\nThank you", "Canadian nurse here: its actually under a month wait in ontario. Can be as quick as 10 days. Depends on how fast the pt is assessed by the physician/np who will be doing the procedure. Depends on the illness as well.", "I hope you find peace Op. Oregon is absolutely beautiful. We welcome you with open arms \u2764\ufe0f", "California also has the End of Life Act", "It\u2019s beautiful in Oregon as well. See the forests and beaches :)", "Washington and California have this as well.", "Good to know. People in MB were making it seem like it takes months if not longer. Maybe that's including the initial diagnosis and options for treatment? Our healthcare has been gutted to hell over here so who knows."]}
