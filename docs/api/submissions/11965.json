That means that when things get worse, they are going to be the ones there to take care of you, and they really should be aware and able to prepare for that.\n\nI understand that you don't want to hurt them, and you don't want to have to console them when you are going through it, but I do feel like it's important to sit them down and have a conversation about it.", "You have a right to keep this information private. I would encourage you to find a therapist and work out how to communicate with your family your end of life desires--that you don't want to be the one to help them cope, you just want to be able to enjoy the time you have. But that is entirely up to you.\n\nHowever,  putting the burden of this secret on your 17 year old sibling is wrong.

However, you chose to give up your independence and move back in with your parents and so you now have limited that freedom. You are living in their house, they clearly love and care about you and, as you are living there, it is there right to know about your deteriorating health. \n\nYou cannot move in and just expect to die there without warning and preparing them first. Whilst the situation is tragic, that choice would be the ultimate selfish act and would likely leave them with a lot of anger, hurt, blame and resentment once you pass.\n\nDealing with terminal illness is tough and you are likely going through your own grief at the moment. However, it does not give you the right to make selfish decisions that ultimately negatively impact those around you.\n\nYour sister is right, sit them down and tell your family. Then plan some fun stuff together so that you can all make memories that they can reflect on with tears of joy rather than anger and frustration.

It's way too personal and particular to your individual situation.\n\nI would encourage you to do things to make the last year of your life the best it can be. Starting therapy ASAP is a good idea. And, quite honestly, telling your parents seems like a pretty good idea. They're going to start getting ideas sooner or later, so I think it's probably better to share that information than keep it to yourself. I don't mean to put pressure on you, but based on having a few friends and family members who have passed at a young age from terminal illness (cancer), the overwhelming theme I've experienced is that it's better to go through this with people supporting you than on your own.\n\nI'm not a therapist. I don't know you. I'm so sorry this happened. My advice, if it's worth anything, is that you still have a valuable life to live. It's not your burden to care for others who are getting this news. You have to trust the people who love you to do the right thing and be there for you.", "I don't think there's a right answer here. \n\nI can understand why you would want to keep it to  yourself, at least for a while. You are still coming to terms with everything, and you have that right. \n\nOn the flip side of that, I can see where she's coming from too. If my child or close family member was terminally ill and only had a short time left with us, I'd want to know. I would want to be able to support them in any way I could and prepare myself for what was coming. \n\nOnce you are gone, they will spend the rest of their lives missing you and wondering what more than could have done if they'd have only known.", "YTA. Your parents and loved ones need to know so they can be there for you.\n\nYour sister is right that you are an asshole for not telling your family. \n\nYour family is going to find out soon.

And if your sister knows, please believe she will tell your parents sooner or later. Tell them so that all of you can begin to enjoy the time you have left. Who knows, but your parents will be more understanding of why you moved in and aren't working- and maybe they will all come together to make lasting memories for all of you. I dont want to put this pressure on you but you are the one dying so I guess you don't think about how this will be once you leave. But remember once you are gone, they will still be here and you don't want them to be miserable or in pain wishing they had the opportunity to do things diffrent with you.", "YTA for not telling them. \n\nI see why you haven\u2019t and understand that you\u2019re likely still in some sort of denial about this and want the control/not all the focus to be on the fact you\u2019re dying.

And on top of that, it's way harder to cope with a sudden death out of the blue than one you knew was coming.\n\nIf you love your parents, you'll let them know, even if you're unwilling to change your eventual plans.

And if you still haven't said anything, your parents may be upset that they could have planned things and gone places with you while you were quite well. \n\nIt's impossible to say, but I'd tell your sister that you need two or three weeks to process this before you make the next move, and you'd be grateful if she could support you with that.

You do not know what your last days will be like and what kind of help you might need. Your family also needs the time to adjust to this news. Together, you need to make a plan so they know what you would like to happen. You also need to be realistic about possible pain issues, feeding issues, etc that can come up in final days.

Do I blame him or judge him for his choice? No.\n\nThis is your time. Do what you want. Ignore people calling you \"selfish\". Hell, if there is a time to be selfish, it's now.

I can only say that if my loved one was sick, I would wanna know ASAP so I could support them fully. I would also probably be very upset if they didn't tell me until the end. I can't imagine how difficult of a conversation that would be to have, though. I wish you strength during this time", "I'm going to say NAH because you are dealing with something no one at 23 should have to deal with. You need to tell at least your parents. Right now you need support and if indeed it comes to it, you may need care from those around you. You cannot go through this without help. If you didn't want to tell everyone that is your choice, but your immediate family should be told because they need to be able to deal with this. All of you will be grieving. Right now I think you are a bit shell-shocked, and perhaps a bit in denial, but you need the support of your family more than you've ever needed before so don't delay.", "There\u2019s multiple layers to this. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for not wanting to spend the rest of your time dealing with people\u2019s grief. You have a right to make this time about you and your needs. Go LIVE your life! Hang out with friends and family, travel, take the big risks you were too afraid too! Have fun!!\n\nThat being said, you ATH if you expect your family to support and care for you during this time without telling them why (to them you\u2019re just a lazy kid who quit a good job to mooch off of them). Your sister is right. Eventually you won\u2019t be able to hide it anymore and it will devastate them, and any unkind words spoken will haunt them. \n\nSo make your choice. Either keep your secret and find a way to support yourself and hire a caregiver to help you as your illness progresses, or tell your parents if you expect to continue living at home and have them care for you.\n\nIf you do decide to keep your secret, be kind enough to create a video (first thing we forget is the sound of a loved ones voice, so videos are great gifts), or write a letter to your parents explaining the reason why. They\u2019ll be devastated, and they\u2019ll carry that pain with them for the rest of their lives. They\u2019ll blame themselves thinking they did something wrong and that\u2019s why you never told them. So be kind, and explain somehow why you kept it a secret.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re clearly struggling (as expected). Talk to a therapist. There\u2019s a lot for you to process too. And if you haven\u2019t yet, get a 2nd opinion. Always get a 2nd opinion when it comes to terminal diagnosis.", "NTA because heaven knows how hard this must be for you. Possibly not practical, though, there surely can only be so long you can say you don't want to talk about it before your parents get so worried they start getting really, really pressing with the questions, or they tell your sister they're so worried she cracks and tells them. I wish you the least pain and the most peace possible, I'm so sad for you, but I have lost far too many people far too young to things like cancer and I'd honestly be super tempted to take the same route as you.", "Your family can't force you to do any procedures.

Your sister already knows now, you can't expect her to keep your impending death a secret.  You'll just be making that year one of the most painful ones she'll have to live through because she's losing you, and she can't even talk about it.  Not just that, but I'd assume in the next few months, you will probably begin to visibly deteriorate.  At that point, they're all gonna figure out something is really wrong.  I think if you tell them now, they can spend their last year with you and say and do everything they need to before it's too late.

Let them be involved in making the most of memories. If you don\u2019t want any treatment, tell them.

Please tell me you're not going to just let them find out the hard way after the fact. That would be cruel.", "NAH but you are being selfish. Your parents brought you into this world, raised you, and love you (at least I assume so since you haven't started otherwise). You moved into their home with no explanation, and will get sick which will worry them. Then they will be \"surprised\" when you eventually tell them or die, leaving them with a mess of conflicted emotions to deal with. I get that this is your illness, but like any illness it does affect everyone around you. You are robbing them of time with you. You want to create memories with them, but how will they know to appreciate the time they have left if they don't know? \n\nLet's say for example you decide you want to do a family trip, but they don't prioritize it because they have lives and other things going on. Are you going to be angry that they don't come? Will they be dealing with massive guilt that they didn't because they didn't know?\n\nOn top of that, I think you're naive about the level of care and assistance you'll need from them. My best friend/cousin has been diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer last year, which gives her 2-5 years to live. She started with surgery, which she was in the hospital for a week for. Her memory and cognitive function took a while to come back and even now it's not 100%. Her husband had to take notes at all her appointments to keep track of what was going on, and she wasn't allowed to be alone for 3 weeks. She then had 6 weeks of daily radiation, and due to losing her license (seizures) she had 3 people on a rotating schedule driving her. Since then she is now able to drive and is doing chemo through a pill at home so she is more self sufficient, but the amount of emotional support she recieves is immeasurable. Her treatments ended up moving her to 5 years of life instead of two, and she is about to leave on a month long trip with her husband. \n\nYou're excuse of your parents making you do anything is BS. You have final say on your care, they can't make you do anything. And it will be worse for you if you wait until later to tell them, because then they will be acting more desperate, hurt, and unreasonable. \n\nYour sister will not keep this a secret anyways. No sane person would keep that promise, especially because she will be the one dealing with the aftermath. May as well take control of the situation and tell them yourself. It will go way worse if you don't.\n\nI get that you are probably fairly early into your diagnosis, which is why you are scared to tell anyone. But trust me, you need your village more than ever. It is scary as hell, but after the initial shock wears off, I promise you will be so happy you did. Those last moments will be very lonely without your loved ones. \n\n\nWish you all the best, I hope to see a positive update soon.", "Well, you ahbe to wll them.

Events like this often break families apart - think divorce, depression, substance abuse, etc. Giving them the chance to go through this with you would be an act of kindness.\n\nI get that you're concerned about how your family will react, but there are other solutions for that. You could invite them to a session with a family therapist. You could write them a long letter explaining how you want them to treat you over the next year. You could enilist your sister as an ally in making sure your parents aren't going to be \"too much\".

Most of us can barely imagine what it is like to be in your position, let alone truly empathize, so we should not try to judge you.\n\nI do, however, have some experience with a situation like yours, and I'll relate a little of what it was like. Maybe it will help with your decision.\n\nA very dear friend of mine, pretty much family, knew she was dying. She chose not to tell anyone (except one person who was helping care for her) because she didn't want to be treated any differently or deal with the stress that others knowing would bring. She wanted to retain as much dignity to the end as she could, and it pretty much worked for that. None of us, her blood relatives included, knew she was dying until a few months before the end (and some didn't know how serious it was until the last few days).\n\nAfter her passing was absolute chaos. Her family melted down and caused havoc with her estate. Her friends were left trying to cope with a loss that, from their angle, came out of nowhere. \n\nSo I think whether you tell anyone or not depends on your priorities. I think you're right that if you tell, you'll feel the burden of trying to lift everyone around you up. Putting on a false front is exhausting, and you'll be battling your illness at the same time. I wouldn't blame you for not telling.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to make sure that your last wishes are respected and your estate handled the way you want it handled, it may benefit you to start dealing with it before you pass rather than relying on grief-stricken family members and friends to make the right calls in the midst of loss. It may also benefit all of you to seek counseling together so that you have support in your last year rather than you supporting them, should you choose to tell them.\n\nNo matter what you decide on this issue, you are not an asshole. No one knows how they would handle this situation until they're in it, and the answers aren't cut and dried. The best you can do is sort through your priorities for telling vs. not telling, and act accordingly. Either way, I wish you luck.", "You are a good human. Sorry you are going through this.

I understand you don't want to hurt them and don't want to have to be consoling them while you are trying to enjoy what time you have left. Those are both valid reasons. The thing is, if they find out when you are no longer able to hide it and can no longer do as much, then they will be grieving while you need the most positive support. You should set them all down and let them know what is going on and let them know you want to get the most out of your life you have left. They may then throw all sorts of energy into helping you have experiences and fun that at the moment you don't think you might be able to have. They will be able to then look back on their time with you and not have it tainted by knowing you hid it from them and they weren't able to make the most positive memories possible.\n\nI had 2 friends who barely managed to make it through college because of the extreme holes in their hearts. They wanted to have the most out of life, and their family was able to let them go to college and experience life because they knew it was nearing the end and they had already made their peace with it.", "I don't think YTA. Honestly, it's your life. It's your experience. And....your boundaries. I may have the wrong understanding because I'm not close with my family, or anyone really, who gets to question my decisions. Yes, this does effect them. That's true. \n\nIf I may suggest, rather than a black or white perspective, let's add a little shading. Perhaps see a therapist or talk with a death doulla about how to prepare for their response. Another idea is to consider going to YouTube and looking up Ted talks on death and also checking out...shoot I might have the wrong title, but I think it's Death over Dinner. Or maybe Dinner over Death? Either way this dude who studied cultural regards to death suggested we have open and honest discussions about it, in the spirit of acceptance and understanding it as a natural human experience.", "I\u2019m so sorry but please tell your family so they can support you and take advantage of this time. Your sister most likely will tell if you don\u2019t do better it come from you and that way you aren\u2019t sneaking and lying to your family. I\u2019m so sorry hun please take care of yourself", "I'm so sorry. No one should have to go through such an illness. I completely understand why you're keeping it to yourself. I don't think you're being selfish. She doesn't understand what you're going through. Eventually, you'll have to tell them. I hope you can pass with peace and love. NTA.", "I won\u2019t call you an asshole but you need to tell your family. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone and they are going to find out. Also it will help them to come to terms with your situation.", "Very very gentle yes. Either way what's happening is going to be hard on them as it is you but it will be much worse if it just happens suddenly and they don't know why. At least with them knowing they can truly make however long you have left wonderful and they can prepare themselves and you for what's to come.", "The softest of soft YTA on this one. I understand completely but your sister is completely right. You can't hide it for long, especially from the people you want to have around you during the process. Tell them, let them know they can have a little while to grieve, like a week, but then you want to get started on a kick-ass bucket list with them and have as much fun as possible and give them as many memories to carry on as you can. Good luck to you.", "Jumping in on this one too. You also need to have a living will and power of attorney in place for when you're not able to make your own decisions.

And also to make arrangements for when it happens. That's one thing you may need to start considering as well do you want to be buried or do you want to be cremated? I will tell you right now you can find very nice looking urns off of Amazon...   They will be about a third of The Price funeral homes  charge", "Also, her last moments aren't going to be filled with happiness this way. The family is rightly questioning OPs life choices right now. This is a recipe for the end of their life to be filled with resentment, conflict, and disappointment. And then their parents will feel guilty when the truth is revealed. I won't go so far as to call a terminal 23 year old an AH but this plan is truly unkind to all parties.", "I also want to add, as someone who lost a parent to cancer, there's plenty of chances to make new happy memories. Taking pictures. Having a support system behind you.", "They should also be aware to help you get everything together before you pass. I know it\u2019s grim but funerals are expensive. You are young and I\u2019m thinking you probably don\u2019t have life insurance. They\u2019ll need to make arrangements to care for you before it happens. I\u2019m sure they also want to enjoy time with you while you are well enough to be up and about doing things. Imagine if you were in their place and it was your child who was I\u2019ll, wouldn\u2019t you want to know?", "Thank you for being one of the few to actually understand that 'asshole' judgments don't really apply here. Interesting how so many keyboard warriors find it easy to call a 23 year old facing the end of their life an asshole.", "I was thinking this too. I\u2019m in my twenties, a mom and a hospice volunteer. Anticipatory grief (knowing death is coming and grieving before a loved one is gone) is honestly often easier for a family than if a traumatic event takes someone suddenly. It\u2019s how the brain processes things, we can\u2019t handle it all at once which is why there are stages to grief. It takes time to cope and it takes people much longer to cope with unanticipated death. Family therapy would be of great benefit here.\n\nAs a parent I would feel like shit if my child hid this from me. I would always wonder \u201cwhat if\u201d (what did I do that made them not want to tell me? Why couldn\u2019t I comfort them? Why couldn\u2019t I be there for them?) to outlive a child is unimaginable grief.\n\nAnd for one sibling to bear this burden alone? That could break them.\n\nI totally understanding needing some time to process because I\u2019m the same way *but* I really think therapy would be beneficial here as everyone will have their own way of grieving and those ways can clash, especially in a single household. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to act in a way not that would prioritize the family right now but, as a hospice volunteer, I can also say that families can completely fall apart following the death of the patient. They have their own needs and grief and a lifetime without someone they dearly loved to endure.", "Fuck, man, I hope you accomplish the goals you've set for yourself in the time you have left and that you and your family are able to enjoy each other's company a lot in the coming months.", "Sometimes, a shift in capacity occurs overnight without warning.  If that happens, you won't be able to make it out of the country.  I can't imagine how difficult this is for you to come to terms with.  However, your parents need to know.  \n\nMy sister told me about her illness.  It was devastating to me.  However, I don't regret knowing in the least.  I had time to tell her things that I may not have had I not known.  \n\nI'm so sorry. I wish you peace.", "So\u2026. One day you\u2019re just going to disappear?", "My colleague just past away from glioblastoma (aggressive form of brain cancer). \nShe got diagnosed at 25, was one year out of nursing school, and was given a few years to live. \nShe went peacefully, surrounded by family, friends and coworkers.

Hospices provide amazing resources to families and their patients too. \n\nOne thing. \n\nI\u2019m a critical care nurse and saw so much death lately, I can\u2019t even talk without tears about it. \nI also experienced the worst of the pandemic times when my patients died alone. The only thing they wished  for is to have their families there. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through the hardest time anyone can imagine. \nTry to find it in you to talk to your family to let them know what to expect. \nDon\u2019t ask for advice, tell them how it will go, set the boundaries.\n\nOP, please don\u2019t go through this by yourself!\n\nHugs\n\n\nPS: and no matter what, go to Switzerland!", "People on posts like this never think about it from the OP's POV, only from the POV of the family and friends. It's usually because imagining themselves as the terminal person is too difficult, whereas imagining being left behind is easier.", "Honestly, when it comes to someone who is literally facing the end of their life I think their wishes and needs trump anyone else.

I\u2019m sorry darling but if you only have a year left, going to Switzerland isn\u2019t feasible. I know bc I looked into it and applied for it when I was younger. Even to get the initial approval takes months. Then you need months of proof, documentation etc. the process usually takes a few years in total. I might be wrong but I recall it being around a 4 year process. It would be easier to do it in your own country if it\u2019s legal. If you are in the US, there are some states where it is legal for terminally ill patients.", "No, you don't have to experience that.

The worst thing.   You may be acting on an unconscious drive to regain your sense of control, which could be a true underlying  motivation to keep this secret. Telling (or not telling) people is something you can still control, and as long as you withhold telling others you can still maintain control, and so by proxy have control over death.\n\n It  is your choice, But this issue of telling your family is not the real control you wish for. I hope you are able to let them in.  I wish you all the best.   Again I am so sorry.", "I don't know where you live, but Oregon has death with dignity and has eliminated the residency requirements.

When the parents realize that the younger sister knew and didn't tell them, it will very likely destroy their relationship with her, so she will be, what, 18 and suddenly without her sibling and with, at best, a permanently damaged relationship with her parents (and that's if they're willing to forgive her, which they might not), while also living with the incredible guilt of knowing what she knew and not telling her parents, leaving them to be blindsided. Meanwhile, the parents will be heartbroken to have lost OP, tortured by guilt because OP didn't trust them enough to tell them about the terminal diagnosis, and furious with their younger daughter for knowing and hiding it all from them.\n\nSorry, no. OP absolutely has a terribly hard road ahead, and I certainly wish it weren't the case, but what she is contemplating inflicting on her family (perhaps especially her sister) is nothing short of monstrous.

They raised her to feel stressed/afraid about going to them about problems to the point where she can't confide in them for something so important. It absolutely should break their hearts that OP feels this way, and they should reflect on why that happened once they find out. \n\n\nOP doesn't need people guilt tripping her to consider everyone else's feelings before her own, she needs the unselfish support that she obviously never received before. \n\n\n\"I'll have to cheer everyone up while coping with my illness as everyone always goes to me when they're experiencing hardship even my parents.\"\n\nShe does need to tell them, but it's necessary to recognize that this kind of mindset does not happen in someone who grew up feeling securely loved and supported by their family.\n\nOP is not monstrous or unfeeling, she's a young woman grappling with huge news in a short amount of time, with an evidently emotionally-insecure upbringing.", "OP, when they find out, they are going to hate that you were there for just that reason.  They are going to hate that they were \"busy\" or \"didn't\" have time when you asked to do something with them.
