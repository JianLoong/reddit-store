That means that when things get worse, they are going to be the ones there to take care of you, and they really should be aware and able to prepare for that.\n\nI understand that you don't want to hurt them, and you don't want to have to console them when you are going through it, but I do feel like it's important to sit them down and have a conversation about it.", "You have a right to keep this information private. I would encourage you to find a therapist and work out how to communicate with your family your end of life desires--that you don't want to be the one to help them cope, you just want to be able to enjoy the time you have. But that is entirely up to you.\n\nHowever,  putting the burden of this secret on your 17 year old sibling is wrong.

However, you chose to give up your independence and move back in with your parents and so you now have limited that freedom. You are living in their house, they clearly love and care about you and, as you are living there, it is there right to know about your deteriorating health. \n\nYou cannot move in and just expect to die there without warning and preparing them first. Whilst the situation is tragic, that choice would be the ultimate selfish act and would likely leave them with a lot of anger, hurt, blame and resentment once you pass.\n\nDealing with terminal illness is tough and you are likely going through your own grief at the moment. However, it does not give you the right to make selfish decisions that ultimately negatively impact those around you.\n\nYour sister is right, sit them down and tell your family. Then plan some fun stuff together so that you can all make memories that they can reflect on with tears of joy rather than anger and frustration.

It's way too personal and particular to your individual situation.\n\nI would encourage you to do things to make the last year of your life the best it can be. Starting therapy ASAP is a good idea. And, quite honestly, telling your parents seems like a pretty good idea. They're going to start getting ideas sooner or later, so I think it's probably better to share that information than keep it to yourself. I don't mean to put pressure on you, but based on having a few friends and family members who have passed at a young age from terminal illness (cancer), the overwhelming theme I've experienced is that it's better to go through this with people supporting you than on your own.\n\nI'm not a therapist. I don't know you. I'm so sorry this happened. My advice, if it's worth anything, is that you still have a valuable life to live. It's not your burden to care for others who are getting this news. You have to trust the people who love you to do the right thing and be there for you.", "I don't think there's a right answer here. \n\nI can understand why you would want to keep it to  yourself, at least for a while. You are still coming to terms with everything, and you have that right. \n\nOn the flip side of that, I can see where she's coming from too. If my child or close family member was terminally ill and only had a short time left with us, I'd want to know. I would want to be able to support them in any way I could and prepare myself for what was coming. \n\nOnce you are gone, they will spend the rest of their lives missing you and wondering what more than could have done if they'd have only known.", "YTA. Your parents and loved ones need to know so they can be there for you.\n\nYour sister is right that you are an asshole for not telling your family. \n\nYour family is going to find out soon.

Its not fair at your age.", "You would be wrong to not tell them. There are many gifts of words to be exchanged still.

And if your sister knows, please believe she will tell your parents sooner or later. Tell them so that all of you can begin to enjoy the time you have left. Who knows, but your parents will be more understanding of why you moved in and aren't working- and maybe they will all come together to make lasting memories for all of you. I dont want to put this pressure on you but you are the one dying so I guess you don't think about how this will be once you leave. But remember once you are gone, they will still be here and you don't want them to be miserable or in pain wishing they had the opportunity to do things diffrent with you.", "YTA for not telling them. \n\nI see why you haven\u2019t and understand that you\u2019re likely still in some sort of denial about this and want the control/not all the focus to be on the fact you\u2019re dying.

And on top of that, it's way harder to cope with a sudden death out of the blue than one you knew was coming.\n\nIf you love your parents, you'll let them know, even if you're unwilling to change your eventual plans.

And if you still haven't said anything, your parents may be upset that they could have planned things and gone places with you while you were quite well. \n\nIt's impossible to say, but I'd tell your sister that you need two or three weeks to process this before you make the next move, and you'd be grateful if she could support you with that.

You do not know what your last days will be like and what kind of help you might need. Your family also needs the time to adjust to this news. Together, you need to make a plan so they know what you would like to happen. You also need to be realistic about possible pain issues, feeding issues, etc that can come up in final days.

Do I blame him or judge him for his choice? No.\n\nThis is your time. Do what you want. Ignore people calling you \"selfish\". Hell, if there is a time to be selfish, it's now.

I can only say that if my loved one was sick, I would wanna know ASAP so I could support them fully. I would also probably be very upset if they didn't tell me until the end. I can't imagine how difficult of a conversation that would be to have, though. I wish you strength during this time", "I'm going to say NAH because you are dealing with something no one at 23 should have to deal with. You need to tell at least your parents. Right now you need support and if indeed it comes to it, you may need care from those around you. You cannot go through this without help. If you didn't want to tell everyone that is your choice, but your immediate family should be told because they need to be able to deal with this. All of you will be grieving. Right now I think you are a bit shell-shocked, and perhaps a bit in denial, but you need the support of your family more than you've ever needed before so don't delay.", "There\u2019s multiple layers to this. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for not wanting to spend the rest of your time dealing with people\u2019s grief. You have a right to make this time about you and your needs. Go LIVE your life! Hang out with friends and family, travel, take the big risks you were too afraid too! Have fun!!\n\nThat being said, you ATH if you expect your family to support and care for you during this time without telling them why (to them you\u2019re just a lazy kid who quit a good job to mooch off of them). Your sister is right. Eventually you won\u2019t be able to hide it anymore and it will devastate them, and any unkind words spoken will haunt them. \n\nSo make your choice. Either keep your secret and find a way to support yourself and hire a caregiver to help you as your illness progresses, or tell your parents if you expect to continue living at home and have them care for you.\n\nIf you do decide to keep your secret, be kind enough to create a video (first thing we forget is the sound of a loved ones voice, so videos are great gifts), or write a letter to your parents explaining the reason why. They\u2019ll be devastated, and they\u2019ll carry that pain with them for the rest of their lives. They\u2019ll blame themselves thinking they did something wrong and that\u2019s why you never told them. So be kind, and explain somehow why you kept it a secret.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re clearly struggling (as expected). Talk to a therapist. There\u2019s a lot for you to process too. And if you haven\u2019t yet, get a 2nd opinion. Always get a 2nd opinion when it comes to terminal diagnosis.", "NTA because heaven knows how hard this must be for you. Possibly not practical, though, there surely can only be so long you can say you don't want to talk about it before your parents get so worried they start getting really, really pressing with the questions, or they tell your sister they're so worried she cracks and tells them. I wish you the least pain and the most peace possible, I'm so sad for you, but I have lost far too many people far too young to things like cancer and I'd honestly be super tempted to take the same route as you.", "Your family can't force you to do any procedures.

Just tell them what you envision the next few months to be like, what YOU want and how you want it.", "She straight up is in this sub asking if she\u2019s an asshole. I think calling her that isn\u2019t necessarily correct but it is the name of the sub. She\u2019s clearly going through a lot and it\u2019s difficult to come to terms with. \n\nBeing terminally ill is awful and it is truly awful that she\u2019s in that situation. It\u2019s understandable that she is in shock and lost but at the same time if she does not want to tell anyone ever, that makes her an asshole (at least based on what\u2019s presented here, doesn\u2019t seem like family is abusive). It\u2019s difficult for everyone and her hiding this, then going off and dying in secrecy is unfair for her and for her family. \n\nYes, she can do as she pleases but from the perspective of someone who\u2019s lost terminally ill family at young ages, it would hurt to know they went through the process alone and without telling anyone. It\u2019s not that her family \u201cdeserves\u201d to know but it would certainly make the grieving process easier on everyone else. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s selfish of her to do that, because that\u2019s wrong, I just know how I\u2019d feel if a loved one were to do this.", "You said it better than I could. Nothing wrong with wanting to die a certain way, but definitely get everything lined up, especially since they don\u2019t want family\u2019s help at all.", "I was able to create a savings for myself, my parents taught me well.", "I just wanted to spend time with them. I wanted to create memories and be their for my lost moments", "IDK where OP is, but most of the US there's no such thing as death with dignity. Some states have it, but not all.", "I didn't know Canada allowed it as well.\n\nI think I'll look into Canada as an option as it will be much cheaper.\n\nI'll seriously consider telling them I just need some time to get my thoughts in order", "NAH.\n\n\nop, after dealing with a family members terminal illness, i totally get not wanting to tell them. pretending everything is normal/fine/good is very important. \n\n\nbut your sister already knows. you have burdened her with a big secret. shes freaking out and cant talk to anyone about it. \n\nmake a plan to tell your family soon. book a big day with them, something like minigolf or something meaningful for you as a family. bring them all home and have a really nice dinner. tell them at dinner (in the privacy of their home)  \n\n\napologize for keeping it a secret for so long, and explain that you have a plan for end of life care.\n\n\nthank them for such a wonderful day, and assure them that there will be more days like this and that you love them so much.\n\nedit: hugs hugs hugs hugs. i wish the road ahead of you is easy to teavel", "Oregon is a state where you can decide when you go. Death with dignity is what it\u2019s called."]}
