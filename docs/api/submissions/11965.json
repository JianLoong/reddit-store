I would encourage you to find a therapist and work out how to communicate with your family your end of life desires--that you don't want to be the one to help them cope, you just want to be able to enjoy the time you have. But that is entirely up to you.\n\nHowever,  putting the burden of this secret on your 17 year old sibling is wrong.

However, you chose to give up your independence and move back in with your parents and so you now have limited that freedom. You are living in their house, they clearly love and care about you and, as you are living there, it is there right to know about your deteriorating health. \n\nYou cannot move in and just expect to die there without warning and preparing them first. Whilst the situation is tragic, that choice would be the ultimate selfish act and would likely leave them with a lot of anger, hurt, blame and resentment once you pass.\n\nDealing with terminal illness is tough and you are likely going through your own grief at the moment. However, it does not give you the right to make selfish decisions that ultimately negatively impact those around you.\n\nYour sister is right, sit them down and tell your family. Then plan some fun stuff together so that you can all make memories that they can reflect on with tears of joy rather than anger and frustration.

It's way too personal and particular to your individual situation.\n\nI would encourage you to do things to make the last year of your life the best it can be. Starting therapy ASAP is a good idea. And, quite honestly, telling your parents seems like a pretty good idea. They're going to start getting ideas sooner or later, so I think it's probably better to share that information than keep it to yourself. I don't mean to put pressure on you, but based on having a few friends and family members who have passed at a young age from terminal illness (cancer), the overwhelming theme I've experienced is that it's better to go through this with people supporting you than on your own.\n\nI'm not a therapist. I don't know you. I'm so sorry this happened. My advice, if it's worth anything, is that you still have a valuable life to live. It's not your burden to care for others who are getting this news. You have to trust the people who love you to do the right thing and be there for you.", "I don't think there's a right answer here. \n\nI can understand why you would want to keep it to  yourself, at least for a while. You are still coming to terms with everything, and you have that right. \n\nOn the flip side of that, I can see where she's coming from too. If my child or close family member was terminally ill and only had a short time left with us, I'd want to know. I would want to be able to support them in any way I could and prepare myself for what was coming. \n\nOnce you are gone, they will spend the rest of their lives missing you and wondering what more than could have done if they'd have only known.", "YTA. Your parents and loved ones need to know so they can be there for you.\n\nYour sister is right that you are an asshole for not telling your family. \n\nYour family is going to find out soon.

And if your sister knows, please believe she will tell your parents sooner or later. Tell them so that all of you can begin to enjoy the time you have left. Who knows, but your parents will be more understanding of why you moved in and aren't working- and maybe they will all come together to make lasting memories for all of you. I dont want to put this pressure on you but you are the one dying so I guess you don't think about how this will be once you leave.

And on top of that, it's way harder to cope with a sudden death out of the blue than one you knew was coming.\n\nIf you love your parents, you'll let them know, even if you're unwilling to change your eventual plans.

And if you still haven't said anything, your parents may be upset that they could have planned things and gone places with you while you were quite well. \n\nIt's impossible to say, but I'd tell your sister that you need two or three weeks to process this before you make the next move, and you'd be grateful if she could support you with that.

You do not know what your last days will be like and what kind of help you might need. Your family also needs the time to adjust to this news. Together, you need to make a plan so they know what you would like to happen. You also need to be realistic about possible pain issues, feeding issues, etc that can come up in final days.

Do I blame him or judge him for his choice? No.\n\nThis is your time. Do what you want. Ignore people calling you \"selfish\". Hell, if there is a time to be selfish, it's now.

I can only say that if my loved one was sick, I would wanna know ASAP so I could support them fully. I would also probably be very upset if they didn't tell me until the end. I can't imagine how difficult of a conversation that would be to have, though. I wish you strength during this time", "I'm going to say NAH because you are dealing with something no one at 23 should have to deal with. You need to tell at least your parents. Right now you need support and if indeed it comes to it, you may need care from those around you. You cannot go through this without help. If you didn't want to tell everyone that is your choice, but your immediate family should be told because they need to be able to deal with this. All of you will be grieving. Right now I think you are a bit shell-shocked, and perhaps a bit in denial, but you need the support of your family more than you've ever needed before so don't delay.", "There\u2019s multiple layers to this. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for not wanting to spend the rest of your time dealing with people\u2019s grief. You have a right to make this time about you and your needs. Go LIVE your life! Hang out with friends and family, travel, take the big risks you were too afraid too! Have fun!!\n\nThat being said, you ATH if you expect your family to support and care for you during this time without telling them why (to them you\u2019re just a lazy kid who quit a good job to mooch off of them). Your sister is right. Eventually you won\u2019t be able to hide it anymore and it will devastate them, and any unkind words spoken will haunt them. \n\nSo make your choice. Either keep your secret and find a way to support yourself and hire a caregiver to help you as your illness progresses, or tell your parents if you expect to continue living at home and have them care for you.\n\nIf you do decide to keep your secret, be kind enough to create a video (first thing we forget is the sound of a loved ones voice, so videos are great gifts), or write a letter to your parents explaining the reason why. They\u2019ll be devastated, and they\u2019ll carry that pain with them for the rest of their lives. They\u2019ll blame themselves thinking they did something wrong and that\u2019s why you never told them. So be kind, and explain somehow why you kept it a secret.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re clearly struggling (as expected). Talk to a therapist. There\u2019s a lot for you to process too. And if you haven\u2019t yet, get a 2nd opinion. Always get a 2nd opinion when it comes to terminal diagnosis.", "NTA because heaven knows how hard this must be for you. Possibly not practical, though, there surely can only be so long you can say you don't want to talk about it before your parents get so worried they start getting really, really pressing with the questions, or they tell your sister they're so worried she cracks and tells them. I wish you the least pain and the most peace possible, I'm so sad for you, but I have lost far too many people far too young to things like cancer and I'd honestly be super tempted to take the same route as you.", "Your family can't force you to do any procedures.

Your sister already knows now, you can't expect her to keep your impending death a secret.  You'll just be making that year one of the most painful ones she'll have to live through because she's losing you, and she can't even talk about it.  Not just that, but I'd assume in the next few months, you will probably begin to visibly deteriorate.  At that point, they're all gonna figure out something is really wrong.  I think if you tell them now, they can spend their last year with you and say and do everything they need to before it's too late.

Let them be involved in making the most of memories. If you don\u2019t want any treatment, tell them.

Please tell me you're not going to just let them find out the hard way after the fact. That would be cruel.", "NAH but you are being selfish. Your parents brought you into this world, raised you, and love you (at least I assume so since you haven't started otherwise). You moved into their home with no explanation, and will get sick which will worry them. Then they will be \"surprised\" when you eventually tell them or die, leaving them with a mess of conflicted emotions to deal with. I get that this is your illness, but like any illness it does affect everyone around you. You are robbing them of time with you. You want to create memories with them, but how will they know to appreciate the time they have left if they don't know? \n\nLet's say for example you decide you want to do a family trip, but they don't prioritize it because they have lives and other things going on. Are you going to be angry that they don't come? Will they be dealing with massive guilt that they didn't because they didn't know?\n\nOn top of that, I think you're naive about the level of care and assistance you'll need from them. My best friend/cousin has been diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer last year, which gives her 2-5 years to live. She started with surgery, which she was in the hospital for a week for. Her memory and cognitive function took a while to come back and even now it's not 100%. Her husband had to take notes at all her appointments to keep track of what was going on, and she wasn't allowed to be alone for 3 weeks. She then had 6 weeks of daily radiation, and due to losing her license (seizures) she had 3 people on a rotating schedule driving her. Since then she is now able to drive and is doing chemo through a pill at home so she is more self sufficient, but the amount of emotional support she recieves is immeasurable. Her treatments ended up moving her to 5 years of life instead of two, and she is about to leave on a month long trip with her husband. \n\nYou're excuse of your parents making you do anything is BS. You have final say on your care, they can't make you do anything. And it will be worse for you if you wait until later to tell them, because then they will be acting more desperate, hurt, and unreasonable. \n\nYour sister will not keep this a secret anyways. No sane person would keep that promise, especially because she will be the one dealing with the aftermath. May as well take control of the situation and tell them yourself. It will go way worse if you don't.\n\nI get that you are probably fairly early into your diagnosis, which is why you are scared to tell anyone. But trust me, you need your village more than ever. It is scary as hell, but after the initial shock wears off, I promise you will be so happy you did. Those last moments will be very lonely without your loved ones. \n\n\nWish you all the best, I hope to see a positive update soon.", "Well, you ahbe to wll them.

Events like this often break families apart - think divorce, depression, substance abuse, etc. Giving them the chance to go through this with you would be an act of kindness.\n\nI get that you're concerned about how your family will react, but there are other solutions for that. You could invite them to a session with a family therapist. You could write them a long letter explaining how you want them to treat you over the next year. You could enilist your sister as an ally in making sure your parents aren't going to be \"too much\".

Most of us can barely imagine what it is like to be in your position, let alone truly empathize, so we should not try to judge you.\n\nI do, however, have some experience with a situation like yours, and I'll relate a little of what it was like. Maybe it will help with your decision.\n\nA very dear friend of mine, pretty much family, knew she was dying. She chose not to tell anyone (except one person who was helping care for her) because she didn't want to be treated any differently or deal with the stress that others knowing would bring. She wanted to retain as much dignity to the end as she could, and it pretty much worked for that. None of us, her blood relatives included, knew she was dying until a few months before the end (and some didn't know how serious it was until the last few days).\n\nAfter her passing was absolute chaos. Her family melted down and caused havoc with her estate. Her friends were left trying to cope with a loss that, from their angle, came out of nowhere. \n\nSo I think whether you tell anyone or not depends on your priorities. I think you're right that if you tell, you'll feel the burden of trying to lift everyone around you up. Putting on a false front is exhausting, and you'll be battling your illness at the same time. I wouldn't blame you for not telling.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to make sure that your last wishes are respected and your estate handled the way you want it handled, it may benefit you to start dealing with it before you pass rather than relying on grief-stricken family members and friends to make the right calls in the midst of loss. It may also benefit all of you to seek counseling together so that you have support in your last year rather than you supporting them, should you choose to tell them.\n\nNo matter what you decide on this issue, you are not an asshole. No one knows how they would handle this situation until they're in it, and the answers aren't cut and dried. The best you can do is sort through your priorities for telling vs. not telling, and act accordingly. Either way, I wish you luck.", "You are a good human. Sorry you are going through this.

I understand you don't want to hurt them and don't want to have to be consoling them while you are trying to enjoy what time you have left. Those are both valid reasons. The thing is, if they find out when you are no longer able to hide it and can no longer do as much, then they will be grieving while you need the most positive support. You should set them all down and let them know what is going on and let them know you want to get the most out of your life you have left. They may then throw all sorts of energy into helping you have experiences and fun that at the moment you don't think you might be able to have. They will be able to then look back on their time with you and not have it tainted by knowing you hid it from them and they weren't able to make the most positive memories possible.\n\nI had 2 friends who barely managed to make it through college because of the extreme holes in their hearts. They wanted to have the most out of life, and their family was able to let them go to college and experience life because they knew it was nearing the end and they had already made their peace with it.", "I don't think YTA. Honestly, it's your life. It's your experience. And....your boundaries. I may have the wrong understanding because I'm not close with my family, or anyone really, who gets to question my decisions. Yes, this does effect them. That's true. \n\nIf I may suggest, rather than a black or white perspective, let's add a little shading. Perhaps see a therapist or talk with a death doulla about how to prepare for their response. Another idea is to consider going to YouTube and looking up Ted talks on death and also checking out...shoot I might have the wrong title, but I think it's Death over Dinner. Or maybe Dinner over Death? Either way this dude who studied cultural regards to death suggested we have open and honest discussions about it, in the spirit of acceptance and understanding it as a natural human experience.", "I\u2019m so sorry but please tell your family so they can support you and take advantage of this time.

I\u2019m in my twenties, a mom and a hospice volunteer. Anticipatory grief (knowing death is coming and grieving before a loved one is gone) is honestly often easier for a family than if a traumatic event takes someone suddenly. It\u2019s how the brain processes things, we can\u2019t handle it all at once which is why there are stages to grief. It takes time to cope and it takes people much longer to cope with unanticipated death. Family therapy would be of great benefit here.\n\nAs a parent I would feel like shit if my child hid this from me. I would always wonder \u201cwhat if\u201d (what did I do that made them not want to tell me? Why couldn\u2019t I comfort them? Why couldn\u2019t I be there for them?) to outlive a child is unimaginable grief.\n\nAnd for one sibling to bear this burden alone? That could break them.\n\nI totally understanding needing some time to process because I\u2019m the same way *but* I really think therapy would be beneficial here as everyone will have their own way of grieving and those ways can clash, especially in a single household. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to act in a way not that would prioritize the family right now but, as a hospice volunteer, I can also say that families can completely fall apart following the death of the patient.

Even to get the initial approval, it takes months. Then you need months of proof, documentation etc. the process usually takes a few years in total.

A grief counselor can help you with this, and help process your own emotions at the same time.  \n- Also, I would recommend getting at least a second opinion on whatever your illness is to make a truly informed decision about plans.

IDK how old the grandmother was, but if she had been healthy another decade could've been an option. The author of this story had to watch as even that year was taken away. The grandmother refused help from everyone, kept the diagnosis a secret until the seizures unveiled it for her, and by that time the only thing the family had left was memories of the grandmother in a hospice bed. They'd had no time to come to terms with this before she died.\n\nYou have the right to keep this a secret if that is your wish. I will never call you an asshole for that. Everyone deserves dignity in death. But do consider that if you keep this a secret, your family will live with what-ifs forever. They will never know if they could've helped you. They won't have any involvement with your treatment, and they won't know if they could've made you comfortable or happy.

Being 23 and learning you're dying soon is a pretty good excuse for someone to not be in their normal mindset and coping in ways that seem off. I don't see cruel intentions here, just someone who is afraid of suffering a lingering death and still processing and trying to figure things out while handling what is probably a great deal of existential fear.

She's dying and yet she chose to move in with her parents; to me, that shows some level of trust and safety.\"\n\n\nIf not her parents, whose responsibility was it to make sure she felt secure in confiding to them? I don't think it's unreasonable to point out that this kind of mentality doesn't come from nowhere, and she even mentioned feeling stressed about likely needing to be their support. If they truly care, they will need to focus on how to best make her feel secure in the time left rather than nurse any sense of being personally wronged.\n\nPeople are being rather harsh on her for being understandably self-absorbed and lost right now.  She hasn't put any actual plans in motion, and she's also acknowledged she shouldn't let her sister bear the secret alone for much longer.\n\n\nLastly, her moving back was likely out of necessity. She mentioned at the beginning that she barely got the chance to enter the workforce, having only just three months of job experience after finishing her internship. It does indicate some level of trust and safety as you said, though I think \"feel okay returning home to parents when dying\" is a tragically low bar for praiseworthy parenting.\n\nBased on her responses, she will likely tell them after a period of reflection. Realistically speaking she'll need help from her family to even do the Switzerland thing if she wants to. I'm sure most people would prefer to go that way instead of suffering, and it's infinitely more selfish to try to insert your own feelings into how someone else wants to die, especially when it comes to terminal illness.", "Please tell your parents.
