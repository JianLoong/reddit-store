Im the only child in my family and my mom has one sister Alicia (late 40s), who has no kids. Without telling us, when he sold his home to move into a retirement home two years ago, he updated his will to change it from dividing things between my mom and aunt, to making me the sole benefactor.\n\nThis wasnt expected on my part, I never really thought about inheritance from him at all, assumed it would be split between his kids and maybe hopefully a long way away, Id inherit from my parents. Its not never work money but its a nice leg up that will let me buy a home without a mortgage if I choose to and just not have to worry so much about finances.\n\nHis funeral was pre paid for by him but there were a couple legal things to sort out that my mom and aunt paid for but I repaid them out of my inheritance for. I also paid off my moms car that she bought a year ago and gave my parents a small sum as well, they've always been supportive of me and paid for my college so I figured its the least I could do. They've been stressed the last couple years so I wanted to alleviate some of that and give them means to go on a nice vacation. I look at this more as sharing my good fortune vs doling out my grandpa's money.\n\nAlicia however also thinks I should give her some money. She finds the whole thing unfair and saying shes being discriminated against for not giving him grandkids. I dont think thats true because my mom didnt inherit anything either. I think he just figured his adult kids were fine and wanted to give me a leg up.\n\nI dont really want to give her anything because she's coming off really rude and entitled about it all. My dad assures me she's just grieving and wants me to be graceful about it. He doesnt necesarrily think I should have to give her anything but thinks it might be a nice olive branch to give her something. Ive been considering it, but some of the rude things she's said make me really not want to, and the money was let to me so I feel like I shouldnt have to. AITA if I stick to my guns and not, or should I be giving her part of it?", "created_utc": 1699290830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p7nlq/aita_for_giving_part_of_my_inheritance_from_my/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do what you want with it.  I strongly suggest you stop giving handouts and open a retirement/investment account with an investment firm.", "NTA...IT's your money to use as you see fit.  You covered all costs associated with the funeral.  Anything else is entirely up to you.  Your aunt is allowed to feel how she feels, but  has absolutely no reason to demand anything of you.", "NTA.\n\nYour aunt is laying a guilt trip on you.  Ignore it.\n\nThe inheritance is yours to do with as you please.\n\nGrandpa knew what kind of person she is and acted accordingly; respect his wishes.", "NTA.  Your grandpa made his decision.", "NTA and keep your money. You will for sure need it for something or other some time in the future. There is nothing like a death in the family to make the vultures start circling around the heir.", "It is YOUR money, do with it as you please.  You do NOT owe your aunt anything.  If your grandpa wanted her to have something, he would have left it for her.\n\nNTA.  Good luck.", "NAH\n\nIt was given to you. You gave some to your mom. She is feeling very left out and cheated. I totally understand EVERYONE's emotions in this story.", "NTA\n\nYour Grandpa knew what he was doing when he made that change to his will. I would assume that he had his own reasons for not including anything for your Aunt in his updated will. You don't have any obligations to anyone to give that money away.", "NTA, if she's been as supportive to you as your parents, maybe consider a nice gift, but you dont owe her anything and she shouldn't act entitled to it.", "NTA, you paid your aunt back the money she spent, which you didn't even have to do. The money was given to you, therefore it's yours to decide how it's spent.", "NTA. Your money, your choice. If he wanted her to have something, he would have left her something. If anything, there's probably a reason he didn't. You don't owe her anything, so don't give in", "NTA. There is probably a good reason why the money was left to you and not your mom and her sister. It's your money and your choice what to do with it.", "Grandpa is the ah. Favoring the grandchild over his own daughter is d\u2014k move.", "NTA - even if you gave her a small sum for a vacation or whatever, I\u2019m betting she wouldn\u2019t be happy.  She almost certainly wants half of the inheritance and a little bit of it likely won\u2019t make her any happier about the situation.  \n\nI don\u2019t know why your Grandpa didn\u2019t want his kids to inherit, but that was his wish.  You gave your parents some of the money out of kindness but that doesn\u2019t mean you owe her anything. \n\nIf you think this will create animosity between your Mom and her sister, you could give your aunt some money to try and smooth things over \u2014 but again, it\u2019s your money to do with as you please, and I kind of doubt it would fix the situation, regardless.  Just know that this might end your relationship with her, but if you don\u2019t care about having a relationship with your aunt, then it\u2019s really no sweat off your back.", "NTA\n\nWhile it would be nice of  you to give her something, it isn't required of you and your parents nor aunt should put you in that position.  Whatever is in your grandpa's Will is in the Will.  If he left it all to you, no one could change that unless they want to contest the Will.  Depending on where you live, that could be an uphill battle for the person contesting it.  It also assumes your aunt wants to go that route as it would tear the family a part.  From my experience, people just go the route of trying to manipulate the beneficiary into giving them money as it is easier in the long run for them.  Don't be manipulated as it will never stopped even after the inheritance is long gone.", "NTA.\n\nYour grandfather gave YOU the money. It is YOUR money. Do with your money as you\u2019d like.", "NTA. I am sure there was a reason why you grandfather did things the way he did. If your aunt  is rude to you, perhaps she was rude to your grandfather as well.\n\nIt was good of you to help your parents if things are tight for them because they helped you in the past. You owe your aunt nothing, especially if she is not nice to you.", "NTA:  this is your money if it went through probate and was distributed to you.  Any money you gave your mom would be a gift with you as the giver and subject to all the gift tax rules.", "You are making big decisions fast.  I'm surprised you already have access to the estate in this short a time.\n\nSlow everything down.  Tell your aunt that for now, you are going to keep the money out of respect for your grandfather.  That the best thing she and everyone else can do is just back off.\n\nThen put the money where it is safe and give yourself time to know what you want to do.  Maybe in the end, you'll sincerely want to gift her something for all the right reasons, not because you are being guilted into it.  Maybe you won't.  Time is your friend now.", "What country do you life in where the will is probated and paid out a month after death?  I'd love to live there.  Here in the US it would have taken a year or more.  \n\nINFO is your aunt financially secure?", "Whatever you give her will not be enough, and once you start she will keep asking and asking for more and more. You help your parents out which is what children do. Your aunt is entitled to nothing. There's a reason why your grandfather didn't leave his kids anything, and you could be generous but if you are she will ask again and again. Just a small thing life's not fair, she didn't get anything and she's mad that you helped your parents. Oh well", "NTA\n\nBUT and it's a big one Grief doesn't bring out the best in anyone...never does and never has.\n\n**Things to consider**\n\nThe stages of grief are\n\ndenial,\n\nanger (which often involves blame),\n\nbargaining (which often involves guilt),\n\ndepression\n\nacceptance\n\nThe trouble is you don't go through them in order you flip flop around the place. Your aunt has been given a huge slap in the face at a time when she is least able to deal with it.\n\nBy leaving the money to you (which makes good financial sense). Your grandfather in effect did choose one daughter over the other.\n\nYour understandable and reasonable repayment of the money your parents invested in your education will feel from her grieving perspective like your mother got an inheritance form their father and she didn't.\n\nNow to be very very clear I am not saying that you need to give or even should give your aunt money..but be kind to her and cut her some grace. Is she being horrid...yes..but that is what people do when they are hurting very very badly. This is not about you..this is about how your Grandfathers actions have made her feel valued as a daughter at time when she has lost him and can never ever make it up or get it back. He sold up and she is left with potentially nothing..you don't mention if there were any keepsakes kept back for mum and her sister or if he culled the lot\n\nThere may also be things in your mother and aunts history with their father than you don't know about. Her childless may have been a stick with which she feels she was beaten her whole adult life. And lets be fair it may or may not have been a choice....again information we don't have an you may not have in it's totality. Women choosing to be childless is often more complicated than it first appears.\n\nSo be kind to your aunt..as hard as it is when someone is lashing out at us unfairly try to be the bigger person. Grief doesn't last forever and the likelihood is she will come around after a time.....if she doesn't that is very very telling in itself", "NTA\n\nHowever, depending on where you live she might be able to contest the will if it's not 100% water tight.\n\nEdit: Guessing the downvotes come from people who aren't aware of this. In various places a will is written so as leave a nominal amount to person X so that they can't turn around and claim they'd been forgotten about.", "NTA, but I would probly offer her 100 bucks to shut up.  But that might chance being an A-Hole, so might not be the best course of action lol", "YTA for not sharing equally.   \nYou should have just kept it all for yourself.\n\nBut it\u2019s now your money, so NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Parking money in a HYSA is indeed a smart move before making any big time investments or purchases, especially since you can net around a 4-5% return as of now.
