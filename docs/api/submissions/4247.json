Forcing a 14 year old to keep her hair long and wear makeup when she doesn't want to is particularly terrible. \n\nOH, and people are dragging you in the comments for donating the clothes and makeup - I don't agree, as long as the tags were already removed.

Mom could have returned the clothes or used the makeup for herself.  You should have consulted with her mom before allowing her to get piercings/cut/dye her hair.  I praise you for listening to your daughter and caring about her opinions, but you can advocate for her and still co parent.  I will add that I think the mom is far worse for forcing her daughter into a certain style, and I think it's horrible to make her wear makeup.

Dad isn't clear here on if it was a gift or if the clothes and makeup were to prepare for Christmas. Based on the timing, I'm assuming it's the latter, since Christmas is still a couple weeks out. \n\nRegardless \n\n2. Clothing is a common custody challenge. We don't know what's in their agreement, but it's common for this to be spelled out, especially when parties are contentious.\n\nIf parent 1 purchases something for the child and the child brings it to parent 2s home, the item is to be returned to parent 1s house, unless there is an agreement otherwise. \n\nThere's no mention of mom or dad running to the court to smooth disputes, but this decision, especially at the suggestion of dad, could get him in hot water. He could be responsible for reimbursing mom the cost of the brand new items he essentially threw away.", "It is bullshit. It\u2019s trash. \nHow people use kids to one up each other and win fights is trash. How OPs ex could use this against him in the legal system is trash. \n\nIt\u2019s all bad. This is one of those things where the kid never wins.", "They\u2019re checking birth certificates at Claire\u2019s now ? Lmao.", ">You on the other hand excuse the dad for doing the exact same thing as the mom....Hypocrisy to a T.\n\nI've addressed this multiple times, learn to read and comprehend. \n\n>And then the ignorance of how parenting works on top of that....are you a 14 year old girl?? \n\nParenting \ud83d\ude44 I really pity anyone who was/is/will be parented by you. And you even had the nerve to talk about ignorance \ud83e\udd2e", "Okay just make me look dumb why don't you. Bravo, you make a good point", "To be fair I recently called a piercing place because my 7 year old said she wanted her ears pierced and you do have to bring a birth certificate.", "I mean if you're willing to commit fraud it is whatever but we aren't talking about if someone is going to impersonate a parent but what the piercing places require. Which is permission from a parent or guardian.", "You're a Hypocrite and you have not addressed it....nice try though.\n\nYou kids keep pitying my kids....top 10 in their classes with one on a full academic scholarship to a D1 engineering school.\n\nI pity your kids....having such a closed minded and judgemental parent must be rough for them, especially one too ignorant to see their own Hypocrisy \ud83d\ude09", "Haha. That wasn't my intent!\n\nI have had my share of time in court and know how they think. There's parenting choices vs. parenting choices when you share custody. \n\nUnfortunately when you share custody you have to make decisions differently than you might if you enjoyed sole custody.", "Cool. I didn\u2019t. Glad to debate the merits of the staff at Claire\u2019s with you guys. Totally on topic and relevant.", "In NC you don\u2019t have to have a birth certificate I only had to sign a consent form for my two boys they were 7 and 11", "My 18 year old sister signed when I was 15.", "That's true, I believe I was misinformed on how a court would view the daughters rights. I do appreciate you educating me a little"]}
