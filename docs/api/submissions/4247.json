Your ex might not take the message on board, but she would at least be left with the option of returning what she could and getting the money back, or donating it herself.\n\nDrastic haircuts and piercings should be discussed between the parents first. \n\nHaving said that, I realise your wife is being a complete hypocrite for complaining about you taking her for a haircut and piercing while she pushes your daughter into dresses, makeup, and straightening her hair. \n\nYour ex sucks more for trying to turn your daughter into something she clearly isn\u2019t, but you also overstepped here, albeit with the right intentions.", "ESH  \n\n\nWhile I think the ex is DEEPLY messed up to the point of being emotionally abusive..... drastic changes in appearance should be something you at least have a conversation about if you're co-parenting.

Forcing a 14 year old to keep her hair long and wear makeup when she doesn't want to is particularly terrible. \n\nOH, and people are dragging you in the comments for donating the clothes and makeup - I don't agree, as long as the tags were already removed.

Mom could have returned the clothes or used the makeup for herself.  You should have consulted with her mom before allowing her to get piercings/cut/dye her hair.  I praise you for listening to your daughter and caring about her opinions, but you can advocate for her and still co parent.  I will add that I think the mom is far worse for forcing her daughter into a certain style, and I think it's horrible to make her wear makeup.
