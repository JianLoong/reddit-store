I felt like I looked different from my classmates and hated it.

It\u2019s not that hard to learn. Ask on r/curlyhair how to care for her hair and get a simple routine.

It should\u2019ve gone back to the other parents house unused.

Blue pigment sucks. Hopefully you pay for any treatments needed to keep her hair healthy.", "NTA.

But your donating (i.e. throwing out) new clothing bought by your ex gains you admission to that club too. The permanent disposal of the new clothes wasn't needed at all.", "NTA - nobody should be forced to conform visually for another person. Having to straighten your hair and wear makeup when you don't want to? Your ex is being disgusting, if not abusive.", "ESH\n\nYour ex is clearly a control freak and she shouldn't decide everything in your daughter's life. Your daughter is her own person, she should decide that she wears, not your ex. So the ex is very much the biggest AH.\n\nOn the other hand, both of you are her parents and even if she doesn't communicate with you the decisions she's making towards what she's buying your daughter, you shouldn't do the same. What you did was a cool father move and I'm glad that your daughter likes the new change, but you and your ex need to meet halfway somehow, for your daughter's sake.", "NTA\n\nMy parents were like your wife. I\u2019m NB. When I was 14 my friends took me to a thrift store and we bought a bunch of \u201cboy\u201d clothes. My parents screamed at me and called me ugly.

You are amazing for supporting your child and you are making sure she feels safe with you.", "Nta.  I let my 12 year old do whatever she wants with her hair and have since she was young.  As long as it isn\u2019t harmful to her hair.  At 14 she absolutely should be able to choose her clothes and hair.  These are very formative years where they are trying to find themselves and you are doing what you can so that she is comfortable with herself.", "You are doing absolutely right by your daughter. \n\nI will however say, it's possible she just hasn't come out to you yet in regards to the edit that says she's not trans or NB, or this was her way of coming out to you. \n\nNevertheless, you're making her feel safe and comfortable with herself in a place where she was not safe and I wish I had a dad like you. \n\nNTA.", "YTA. Not because of the buying the clothes or the haircut. You were all the way right. \n\nThe blue hair and the piercings took it too far.  You also donated things she paid for. \n\nEverywhere else we completely rip of parents for doing permanent things without the other parent and say it\u2019s a two yes situation. \n\nThis sub is weird.", "ESH - you and mom need to figure out how to work out this drama without putting your daughter in the middle. The wrath of her mom is going to be awful on her parenting time. \n\nMom needs to let go of her vision of what she wants her daughter to look like. Sounds like she wants a Barbie not a daughter. \n\nYou need to parent in a way that's not spiteful to your ex. You had no right to donate items you didn't purchase. They should have been returned to mom. This could actually get you in trouble at court, should it come to that. \n\nYou also had no right to get the piercing on your minor child without a conversation with mom. Unless you have full legal custody, you must talk with mom about medical decisions. And a piercing falls in that category. \n\nI will applaud you for being there for your daughter and giving her space to be herself, however the way you went about it was awful. This teeters on parent alienation, but only because you handled it so poorly.", "NTA.\n\nThe daughter is 14, and old enough to have body autonomy to decide her OWN hairstyle and clothing preference.\n\nMom seems entitled and convinced to keep her controlled like a dress up doll.", "YTA for donating things that did not belong to you to donate. The haircut and stuff isn't an issue, but presumably those clothes/makeup were purchased by the mother and you had no standing to get rid of them.", "ESH apart from the 14 year old.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have donated the stuff, the ex shouldn\u2019t control what the 14 y/o looks like.\n\nYou did well listening to her, I bet she really needs that ear because it sounds like she really wasn\u2019t comfortable with how she looked before.\n\n14 is a difficult age, keep listening to her, otherwise she\u2019ll shut down and not talk to you.", "NTA, your ex is to obsessed with looks(i can also see why she is ur ex good job getting out in time)", "ESH She's old enough to know what makes her happy. But the stuff mom purchased should have been returned to mom instead of donated. Maybe mom can use it or if she has other kids or nieces. The haircut is fine. 14 is a bit young in my opinion to dye their hair blue.", "NTA for making your daughter happy despite her mother's objections.\n\nHowever... both you and your ex seriously royally suck for not once going to a professional salon to learn how to manage your daughter's hair. She's 14, you've had literal YEARS to seek advice, tips, tricks, and products from a pro. Do better.", "ESH, poor girl stuck between her parents' power struggle.", "NTA. If this is an accurate representation of the whole situation, it's really important you stand your ground on this and advocate for your daughter. You can't control everything she does, and if she feels listened to she's far more likely to tell you things.", "Nta.\n\nIdeally parenting is a conversation where all parties involved agree, you've had a very long time of that not being the case and nothing you did here could make it the case.\n\nUltimately you have to do what is best by your daughter and that is allowing her to develop her own identity and present herself in a way she feels good.  You did that.  That your ex doesn't sucks, but good on you for being in your daughter's corner.  Do be prepared to keep being in that corner: she may ring up upset because your ex has said cruel things about how she looks now and you need to be ready to support her", "NTA\n\nYou respected your daughter's agency. Your ex does not.\n\nAt 14, your daughter should absolutely have a say in her appearance.\n\nDon't know what your custody agreement says, which is where you could run into issues, but your daughter is also old enough to voice her opinion in a custody related court case.", "You're wrong to donate the things her mother got her. You're wrong to ask your daughter if she wanted to do it! \n\nChildren want to please their parents. If your daughter senses that you think your ex is vain and silly, she may very well go along with a dramatic protest against her mom just to please you.\n\nYou should have talked about this with your ex!", "ESH\n\nYou two need to give her space to explore without cramming it down her throat.", "NTA.  Your daughter is not her mother's doll.  She is plenty old enough to make decisions about her own hair, clothes and make-up. I will suggest that she learn to care for her curly hair. She will love it so much more if she knows how to take care of it.  The curly girl method is a wonderful way to care for curls and there are books and Facebook groups, etc that can teach her.  My mom also had no idea how to care for my curly hair so I only learned to blow it out and I always hated my hair.  It wasn't until I was in my 40s that I actually learned how to care for it and it looks better now than it ever has in my life.", "NTA, your daughter is at a time in her life where she should be allowed to experiment and find whatever style(s) she likes. I also have very curly hair, and it's a pain to maintain, so I totally get that. However, typically in shared custody arrangements, the clothes that mom buys stay at moms, and the clothes that Dad buys stay with Dad (at least for young kids). You taking her to get rid of the clothes her mom bought opens the door for her to do the same with the ones you bought.", "NTA Your ex must have seen how miserable her daughter was being dragged around hair salons and clothes shops.", "Satin pillowcases, right?", "These are big decisions that belong to the kid, not the parents, when the kid is 14 and clearly capable of expressing herself. Teenage years are precisely the time to experiment with such things, and parents who throw tantrums about that are over controlling and need to focus on their own looks instead of trying to live vicariously through their kids.", "By straightening her hair.

Ouch.", "Daughter was asked and decided to donate them.", "They belonged to my daughter and she was the one donating", "Why is hair dye and age thing? Piercings are permanent and hair color isnt.", "Whats the power struggle?\n\nThe daughter isn't happy and the Dad sees this. The mother does not.\n\nOne is advocating for the daughter and the other isn't.\n\nIf there is a struggle, it's the dad struggling against the mom to help their daughter be happy but it's not a power trip over who has more control of the kid.", "Unfortunately, it sounds like the ex isn't up for chit chat. 14 years of not listening to her daughter.\n\nI have an ex like that. Doesn't matter what I say; he demands my boys \"talk\" to him. Unfortunately, he gets absolutely incandescent when they don't agree with what he wants. Over the years, we've learned it's best to not \"talk\" to him. We just manage the best we can.", "What kind of 1930s thinking is that,  children are people too and by 14 they have the cognitive ability to 1) decide what they wanna looks like and 2) know that their perception of themselves doesn't have to align with their parents.\n\nYour the kind of person that says children should be seen and not heard, shitty uneducated take", "I get what your are saying but op also stated that his daughter did not like anything she got from her mother. I know that some children wants to please their parents but in this case if the daughter really wanted any of the things she would of said no. Mabye he should have talked about the hair to his ex but then yet again the mother would not want that. Instead op decided it's best for his 14yo daughter to start making decisions about how she want to look and what she wants to do.", "If the daughter had spontaneously said that she wanted to change clothes and cut her hair. Then I think he should have brought that up with his ex. And buying her other clothes is fine! But piercings and drastic hair changes needs to be discussed by both parents!\n\nThis is only OPs take on things also. The ex and the daughter haven't been heard. So we can't assume the ex is a controlling mother just because she flattens her daughters hair", "By what op said dude was just asking what would.make dudes daughter happy. Idk how that translates to smothering her.", "This is so very, very sad. You might have gone to an extreme but I\u2019m glad you stood up for your daughter. NTA.", "The daughter is 14 and the suggestion came from her father.", "Did your daughter spend her money on them?", "one is too controlling and one has no boundaries.\n\n14 is too young to care for blue hair, roots will grow out and neither she nor her dad bother to learn how to take care of her hair in 14 years they wouldn't know how to maintain the blue hair.\n\nDad let her pierce her eyes without consulting mom, she is a minor, this is a both parent permission.", "Doesn\u2019t matter who spent the money. The clothes were for the child, eg; the clothes are the child\u2019s. Mom can be as mad as she wants. She\u2019s just gonna be the one wondering why her kid went NC right after they turn 18."]}
