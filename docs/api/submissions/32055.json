Nevertheless, he is going through a tough time.\n\nI support him, meet with him, call with him. His new gf is more \u201copen\u201d and convinced him to try to go to a sex positive party. He was too shy to go alone and he asked if I wanted to come. I asked my gf of 3 months Alice (we were friends before), stating clearly I\u2019m there to only support Jack and would never do anything, and she said no, and this lead to a big argument because I used to be in open relationships in the past as well (but I\u2019m monogamous with her). I obviously didn\u2019t go to the party.\n\nJack invited me to his housewarming party a month and a half ago and I said yes and confirmed the invite in my calendar. The party is next Saturday. He also invited Alice a couple of weeks ago and she thanked him but we never discussed it. We somehow forgot about it probably, because I proposed going on a trip with Alice on that Saturday and she was very excited, especially because she\u2019s going to her homecountry until NYE.\n\nShe searched for destinations and we kept talking about it, until I realized yesterday that Jack\u2019s housewarming party is on that day. I apologized for disappointing Alice and suggested we should go on a day trip on Sunday instead. I explained to her that I need to be there for Jack. I told her I would prefer going on a weekend trip with her, but I need to be there for him.\n\nShe told me that I should do whatever I want, but she was clearly disappointed and sad, so we talked. She said she didn\u2019t even know I confirmed going to that party, let alone that much in advance, and that it\u2019s true she forgot about it, but since I was the one to propose the weekend trip, she didn\u2019t even think I had anything else planned. She brought up the sex party incident and how me being there for Jack is weird, because I should be there for someone by calling and meeting up with him, which I already am, but not by going to orgies and attending his party where many people are going to come anyway. She understands it\u2019s rude to cancel on him because I had already confirmed, but not because \u201che is so sad and in need for me\u201d.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701343151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187g93n/aita_for_supporting_my_30m_divorced_friend_30m/", "score": 579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friends doesnt need that much support. He is divorced but he still is friend with the ex AND he already has a new girlfriend.

What kind of support did he needed in there?! \n\nSince you were on non monogamy relations before, maybe this friend of yours was/is trying to ruin your current monogamyc relationship.\n\nAbout this housewarming and vacation stuff. You rather loose money (from the reschedule) and time with your girlfriend, whos gonna be way for some time, than miss this party?? \n\nIdk, but maybe you are not so invested in this (monogamyc) relationship as you think you are. You are eager to be such a good friend to this guy, but you dont seem to be so anxious to be a good boyfriend and partner.\n\nYTA. Because your friend doesnt need so much support. Its just a party.

Calling it \"sex positive party\" won't change what it is. \n\nMoreover, if I were your gf I would probably think you're gay/bi and having an affair with Jack.", "YTA - Dude...your divorced friend, who's still friends w his ex AND has a girlfriend does not need your support regarding his divorce. \n\nAnd Alice is right. You don't go to an orgy to support your friend while he gets busy and you just stand around \"supporting\" him.\n\nYou're NTA for having to cancel the weekend getaway bc you did rsvp to the housewarming party first. \n\nI guarantee you that Alice thinks you're likely having an affair with Jack.", "YTA, you value your friend\u2019s feelings more than your partner.", "YTA. You're clearly not mature enough to be in a relationship. You wouldn't have just gone to that sex party to support your friend. You wanted to watch other people have sex and enjoy the attention of other people trying to have sex with you. You're so selfish. And you're the one who forgot about his party and planned a trip with your girlfriend; now you're blowing her off. You clearly don't care about her feelings. You are deliberately hurting her in favor of him. She should dump you and find someone who respects and loves her.", "YTA...going to a sex party JUST to support a friend sounds utterly ridiculous.

Now you have to decide who you\u2019re going to disappoint.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d book the weekend with your girlfriend. Jack is having a housewarming party with his girlfriend; it sounds like he\u2019s moved on quite well and doesn\u2019t need your emotional support for the weekend. \n\nNormally, I\u2019m all about sticking with the first commitment in cases like this but after that orgy nonsense you pulled, Alice probably needs more emotional support than Jack, and could use the reassurance that you don\u2019t want to have sex with Jack or Jack\u2019s new girlfriend or Jack AND his new girlfriend.", "YTA\n\nSo, in a very short relationship, you have continually prioritised your friend and even tried to take him to an orgy? And you're wondering why that makes you an AH?\n\nYour friend is fine. He has a new partner and is amicable with his ex wife. He doesn't need you running after him like a lovesick puppy - which is how it's coming across. You seriously suggested to your monogamous partner that you were going to go to an orgy just to support him?? Nobody believes that.\n\nIf you have feelings for your friend, face up to them. If you don't value your relationship, then end it. But stop insinuating that your GF is the problem here. And throwing around that you've previously been in open relationships as some sort of justification for continually letting your GF down is just pathetic.", "YTA and probably in love with Jack. Alice needs to break up with you because you clearly have issues", "YTA", "YTA. How about you stop supporting your friend (he is fine - new gf, ok relations with ex, parties n stuff) and start minding your own business and your own close relations. Unless you are hiddenly in love with your friend - then pls let Alice go.", "YTA. Clearly and a lot. You were an asshole for even suggesting the sex party, and you\u2019re a major asshole for proposing and making weekend plans only to bail for a housewarming party. Jack seems to be doing just fine. If your friend was potentially going to off himself out of depression you\u2019d have a good reasons this just sounds like you want to party with your friends more than spend time with your girlfriend. In which case, why is she your girlfriend?", "He is not sad and in need of you. I think you should spend the weekend with your girlfriend, considering she\u2019s going to her home country until NYE and you won\u2019t be seeing her.

Go on vacation with your girl as promised, and go see Jacks new place when you return.", "Lot of pointless info in there that is going to eat up the entire focus here.  \n\nYou keep a calendar that you don't bother to check when making plans.  YTA.", "YTA. It's a housewarming, as in the house will still be there the week before and for months after the party. You were the one that proposed the trip!", "YTA, you made plans with your Gf, but you want to cancel them for a housewarming party to support your friend who will have all his friends over supporting him. You are not needed at the party, put your GF first and quit making excuses.", "YTA. You are giving your best friend more support than you\u2019re giving your girlfriend and it is definitely weird to be willing to go to a sex party with him to \u201csupport him\u201d. You\u2019re in a monogamous relationship, sex parties shouldn\u2019t even cross your mind as being appropriate. If you want to stay with your girlfriend I suggest canceling on your friend and spending some time with your girlfriend and focusing on that relationship instead.", "what did i just read\n\nYTA", "OP wanted to go to an orgy to support his friend.... and do what? Hold his hand while he's getting double sandwiched?!? \n\nMajor YTA.", "Yta,", "YTA because if you really want this monogamous relationship to work, you have to learn to prioritize her. Not to just 'linger' on the fringes of an orgy/sex party for 'support', nor to 'support' your friend's housewarming when you were making plans with her. Clearly the housewarming wasn't that big of a deal to you until you remembered after the fact. So give your apologies to Jeff and go with your gf who is going to her home country after that. Or just break up with her and save her having to navigate your inability to commit to a single person. Because that's what this is, you know. You're sabotaging your relationship because you're not really comfortable being monogamous, so you're substituting other partners with 'my friend' to try to create a distance. Either you want to be monogamous or you don't. But figure that shit out before you potentially ruin someone else's life/feelings or break their heart.", "Yta. Stop cheating on Jack with your gf.", "YTA\n\nLOL\n\nJust go fuck your boyfriend bro, you clearly want to be in a relationship with him more than your gf.", "YTA, you can be there for someone \nW/O always being there.\n\nNo reason you need to go to an orgy to support a friend.\n\nYou prioritize him over her.", "YTA. You treat Alice as if she is an afterthought. You are more in a relationship with your friend than your own girlfriend, which quite frankly, you should be embarrassed about. Your friend is divorced, has a new girlfriend and has managed to maintain a friendship with his now ex-wife. He does not need your support, furthermore, going to an orgy is not being supportive. You are weird Af for thinking anyone is buying that. You just want to be rolled up in his business because of the lifestyle he is leading. Clearly, you are not interested in a monogamous relationship, you want an open relationship like the ones you\u2019ve had in the past\u2026 Do Sweet Alice a favor, and let her go find someone who\u2019s going to treat her with the love and respect she deserves. You are not it.", "Man nothing gets through to this guy huh? Like pretty much everyone agrees that he's the asshole but he still refuses to accept it.", "LOL at wondering if you are the a-hole for wanting to go to a swingers party without your girlfriend.\n\nAlso lol for skipping a vacation for a party at dude's house.", "Yta. Are you into your friend? I guarentee that's the vibe Alice is getting. Your friend is an adult with a new gf. His divorce obviously didn't crush him. What exactly does he need your support for? Plus...a sex party!?!? Grow up. That's not something you just go to in support to be a lurker in the background. Nut up. Tell the friend you need to have a weekend with Alice and decide where your priorities are. As of now you're forcing her on the backburner so you can support someone who doesn't need it. He's milking this divorce for sympathy.", "How can your friend say he needs you to go with him since he is going with his GF?   You are an AH.  You have a woman who loves you.  Why are you messing that relationship up?", "Info: How do you support your bro friend at an orgy? Did he need you to hold his dick?\n\nYTA", "YTA.  I am surprised you still have a GF.  However, you would do your GF justice to end your relationship with her, so you can devote to your friends.", "YTA", "YTA. Stop making excuses...

You ask her questions, then get mad at her when she gives you an honest answer (and no, she is not in the wrong for being against you going to a sex party....are you crazy?).  You commit to plans with her, then cancel, because of a housewarming party (you will be one of dozens of guests...honestly, brother, the housewarming party will be fine without you there).  \n\n\nYour commitment to Jack is weird.  Your lack of commitment to Alice is fatal to the relationship.

Were you his hype man? His fluffer? Why didn\u2019t he take his GF to the orgy? If he\u2019s got a new GF and is still friends with his ex-wife, how much \u201csupport\u201d does he actually need?

It sounds like this friend already has a lot of suppprt. He gets along with his ex and has a new GF. Why can't he go one weekend without you? I also think it's pretty weird you thought it would be okay to go to a sex positive party without your SO. You're monogamous in this relationship, so I feel like that's a bizarre ask of her.", "Info: why are you asking if you\u2019re the AH and then not accepting people\u2019s responses? What\u2019s the point then?", "It sounds like you wanna party but don't want to admit that, so you use your friends divorce as an excuse. Your friend is healed enough from his amicable divorce that he's in a long term relationship and friends with his ex-wife.\n\nIf you prefer partying to this weekend trip just say that.

I hope your buddy drops everything to come to support you when all this inappropriateness and neglect results in your breakup.", "YTA and Jack is going to be the reason your GF leaves you. Jack isn't that much in need of support if he has a girlfriend, going to sex parties and having parties. Let's face it Jack is an easy excuse to have fun.

I don't think you are ready for a relationship, you need to still be living the single life.", "YTA. Just put the shoe on the other foot.

It\u2019s an unfortunate mix up, but go away with your gf, especially if she\u2019s going out of the country for a bit. Supporting your pal is all well and good, but this is not an occasion he needs you. It\u2019s his party, he\u2019ll be hosting, busy, talking to all sorts of people.

Your friend is fine. Let his girlfriend worry about him. You're gf comes first", "YTA. Double-booking is an honest mistake, but your solution to your mistake is definitely its own statement. It's not like you forgot about your friend's wedding or something, it's just a party. It would be hard to fuck up more than telling your monogamous girlfriend that you wanted to go to an orgy with your buddy 'just to watch' (which is SO PERVY), but you somehow got through that one. Now YOU suggest a trip before you're apart for a month, then YOU snatch the plan away to hang out with your orgy-friend instead. Dude. You've been dating for 3 months, you do NOT have a strong enough foundation to get through this kind of shit. If that's the note you guys part on I would put money on the relationship not surviving a month + holidays apart- it's an emotional time of year and your GF is gonna have quite a perspective on your shenanigans.", "YTA. How did you support him at the orgy (sex party?, even your GF doesn\u2019t believe this)?

He's also friends with his ex. Exactly what does he need support for?                                    \nDo you ever wonder how it makes his new girlfriend feel that he's so 'distraught' over his recent divorce that he needs you to support him through this difficult time?                         \nYou're either lying to yourself AND your girlfriend, or you're just lying to your girlfriend. Jack doesn't need you. \ud83d\ude44\n\nAlso, I was a member of the \"lifestyle\" community for a long time. No one goes to the parties as back up for their buddy. No one. Even guards and dungeon safety monitors take turns enjoying the party. That you expected her to buy that speaks volumes about how much respect you clearly don't have for her. \n\nI would be livid if my husband tried to cancel plans with me for a house warming.

Why does she have to be the one you disappoint?\n\nEdited for typos/ clarity", ">this lead to a big argument because I used to be in open relationships in the past as well \n\nWere you really in open relationships?

All of that seems really gross.\n\nYTA, BTW.", "YTA as I get the feeling that this is one of those friendships that she will never be a priority in. Nor any girl you come into contact with. According to this post, you are obviously not ready to settle down yet even at 30 yrs old. If you want to live the single life with orgies included, stay single dude. If your bff already has a new girl and friends with his ex, I do not think he is that torn up over his divorce. You just want an excuse to have fun with him. If you had came to me and said oh by the way my friend is hosting an orgy and I'm gonna go, that would have ended the relationship then and there regardless if you actually went or not. This isn't about you not getting time with your friends. You are point blank saying you want to be single and Jack is more important than her with your actions. Do her a favor my guy and end the relationship before it gets much further. She deserves better than you.", "YTA for how you're treating your new gf. But don't you have a calendar?
