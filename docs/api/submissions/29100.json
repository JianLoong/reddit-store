He had 4 other siblings: in this story, we will be looking at the middle sis(AC, not married) and the 5th son (UA, married with 1 adult child and 1 actual child). \n\nDealing with the loss of my father was hard enough. When he died, I (30sM) had to maintain the family business, plan the funeral, try to keep everything in my life from falling apart. The usual. About a week or so after his passing, his former partner J and I went to the funeral home and arranged services.\n\nI got a call from Aunt C (I let it go to voicemail since I didn\u2019t feel like taking to her. She has a voice that she tries to make sound young and babyish but at the same time will talk to you in a condescending manner like no matter what you say, she is right.) The message stated that the two guest bedrooms were going to be reserved for her, her son and his wife that were flying into town. If youve ever planned big event, you probably know how stressful it is to have \u201cguests\u201d while you are trying plan. Didnt even ask if the rooms were open. Despite getting her a hotel room nearby, she made herself at home in the guest room and not contributing a thing aside from complaining about the heat, locking herself away in the room and basically not contributing at all (despite UA coming down to help, and J working with me to make everything work. Her? Nope. Nothing.)\n\nNight Before The Funeral! Uncle A and his family, J, AC and her son were at a restaurant. During the sit-down (appetizers had not even come out yet) J and Uncle A started to get into a major fight over the catering of the event. AC intervened and told me, in a very condescending way, that I needed to mind my own business. Im not going to lie, I saw red. I looked her dead in the eyes and said in a slow, calm voice teeming with building anger \u201cI want you to get your s**t out of my house. You are no longer welcome.\u201d I would think that someone staying as a guest would have a little more respect for their host but she looked me in the eyes and said \u201cThat not going to happen.\u201d I threatened her with throwing her belongings onto the lawn before she got back to the house (she didnt have a rental car and only took an Uber). I left the dinner, not feeling particularly hungry after that ordeal, and proceeded to call her son and told him about the hotel room and info, and that I wanted her out immediately. He came by with her a few hours later and collected her belongings. He and his wife talked to me a little bit but AC just brought her belongings out to the car and avoided talking to me the rest of the night and the day after.\n\nI know that during periods of grieving and planning all this, stress can cause people to go overboard and lash out. Im just wondering if maybe I overdid it a bit.

Deepest condolences for your loss!  Hope you find the strength to bare it! I lost my father at 19 and I had an elder cousin who all but blamed me for his heart condition that caused his demise! I went into a deep depression after that. People need to stay out of the way of grieving family members or it could have dire consequences. Your aunt needed to be called out and I'm glad you did, since it should be therapeutic in weird way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Bit of a shame if you all couldn't talk it out... but you can only dig a well under an outhouse if the shitting stops.", "Not sure if this is E S H or N A H when you are clearly all very testy and it was a stressfull time.  I do think you overreacted.  How can you think it is reasonable to chuck your aunt out for telling you to not intervene in an argument with her (brother) and his family?  It sounds to me that she could have been right and it wasn't your place or right to intervene.", "Every family seems to have that one relative who makes everything more stressful. When my husbands father died when he was 15 (quite unexpected) his uncle picked up his great aunt at the airport, they just started back when she said something really nasty about my mother in law (the sweetest person you will ever meet) husbands uncle stopped the car and told her if she said one nasty thing during her stay he would stuff her back in the car and drive her ass back to the airport where she could sit there alone until the next flght out. She was good for the whole stay.", "your fault was letting her stay in the first place. NTA", "NTA. Your Aunt was disrespectful to you and your home from the outset. \n\nYou were generous enough to overlook this initially but it reads as inevitable she was going to push you too far in the end.", "NTA. Your aunt has been condescending and acting entitled the whole time she's forced you to put up with her. You're handling all of this while grieving for your father, and she just seems insistent on making things harder for you (and nothing else, apparently. She could stand to help, or at the very least let you have your space). It's your house, you get to decide who's in it.", "Thing is, I lost my other father at 13. most of my family is dead now, or havent spoken to me since the funeral. So\u2026not my first funeral. Im slowly but surely trying to rebuild my life starting from Square 1.", "I tried to, but my aunt is very entitled and doesnt understand boundaries. Even a closed door in someone else\u2019s house is an open invitation to her. It was hard and with Uncle A, J and I working while she just sat and complained\u2026it didnt make matters easier.", "I think for the sake of keeping the peace, OP allowed her to stay after she effectively forced her way in, so to speak.", "sorry to her that.", "Oof yeah, that's really tough.  Really sorry for your loss, and respect for stepping up. (And showing the younger ones in the clanwhat being an adult looks like)", "Even some of the older ones, apparently. These people who were almost twice my age were fighting like children and I had to be the voice of reason. The one whom, like my AC here, cant seem to stop treating like a dumb kid. This isnt my first funeral, certainly wont be my last. Ive had years to come to terms with death."]}
