Like daily. It\u2019s very easy to move me to tears, happy or sad. I don\u2019t want/need to be comforted, and it would be tiresome if my poor husband had to try to comfort me every time \ud83d\ude02\n\nI say NAH. Clearly people are just different on this and need to communicate preferences/expectations.", "NAH I think this is just a normal difference in people. Personally I don't want to be comforted if I cry at a movie, but I can understand some people might. Just apologize and tell her you'll keep in mind her preference for the future, and then you know, actually comfort her the next time she cries at a movie.", "INFO: what was the movie?\n\n\nedit OP replied it was Marley & Me", "Honestly, NAH\n\nI hate when anyone acknowledges I'm crying at a movie. I'm shocked anyone would want to make it a whole discussion - I would rather die than go any further than \"Well the beginning of UP sure hits the feelings doesn't it!\"\n\nHowever, she clearly has a different expectation in her mind. Worth having a conversation about when she might want your support, and get on the same page about it. No one is wrong, just be open and honest about it. Hell, maybe something about the movie struck some kind of emotional cord with her that she really wanted to talk about.", "NAH.\n\nI do think you could have acknowledged that she was crying though. You live in the same space, I would consider it common courtesy.", "NTA. Everyone responds to movies differently", "My bf and I watch a lot of movies, and I tend to cry during heartfelt scenes or death scenes, and he\u2019ll literally laugh at me, and I laugh with him. Some scenes are meant to make you cry, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big deal \n\nUnless it was something trauma-related for her, I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d need to comfort her? It\u2019s a movie\nNTA", "I see her point and yours, she may have just wanted some comforting.", "Honestly baffled at the Y T A responses.\n\nMovies make people cry.  It's normal.  It's also normal to give them space to compose themselves.\n\nYou behaved exactly the same as I'd expect from any of my friends or family.\n\nNTA", "Jesus people... Everyone changing their judgement after they found out the movie is Marley and me.... Look am a massive animal lover and animals are my weak spot. I am a massive crier.. I even cry when people on TV shows and movies have happy moments. But my God to act like this because a guy didn't comfort his gf after a movie especially Marley and me!??? Come on now yall...\n\nOP NTA. My bf also doesn't make a huge deal if I cry that doesn't mean he doesn't care or have compassion. In other life situation he is also there for me and he is the only person I can go to when I actually cry and need someone. People need to get a fucking grip in this sub. It's okay your gf wanted you to console her but to ignore you completely because you didn't after she cried in a movie is much. Her first reaction was to ignore you. I feel this is some wierd tik tok thing where you go to test your bf to see if they care about you.", "Well, now you know what her expectations are. Next time put your arm around her or something.", "NTA. These ppl saying you are, are ridiculous. There\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing someone to sit with their emotions for a bit after a movie. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Lots of ppl get emotional at tearjerkers, they\u2019re called that for a reason, and I don\u2019t really think you\u2019re obligated to query them about it. If she wants or needs something, or it\u2019s more than the movie, then she\u2019s an adult and has a mouth. Not this \u201cI\u2019m going to cry and hope he asks me why and when he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to punish him\u201d crap.", "You can just use this as an opportunity to learn what kind of partner your girlfriend is telling you she needs. If taking a few minutes to fawn over her and be attentive makes her feel loved within the relationship, you now know that she needs that. People have different love languages, and it's not always second nature to know someone else's.", "It doesn\u2019t take much effort to offer a \u201cHey, you good?\u201d even when you know it was triggered by a sad movie. It\u2019s a small gesture that shows your partner that you pay attention to them and care about them. Maybe the movie made her remember something troubling in her past, maybe she was just empathizing with the plot/characters. Who knows. You certainly won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t ask. \n\nI\u2019m tempted to go Y T A but I\u2019ll settle for NAH since I don\u2019t think you were intentionally choosing to neglect your partner in a time of need and IF you thought she was in genuine distress (not just movie related), you would have said something. Be there for your partner even if you think the reason is superficial. The smallest gestures often mean the most.", "INFO\n\nSince it was Marley and me, did she go through similar and it brought up sad memories for her and so she feels you just dismissed how she felt (so it ***wasn't*** the movie that made her cry, it was what it reminded her of)\n\nI'm still going NTA, but a simple \"are you ok\" wouldn't go amiss", "i mean, i needed a hug after watching marley and me (i checked the comments to see if the movie was mentioned) so i could totally understand her needing one too considering just how tearjerking that movie is.\n\nbut i also know some other people who would rather be left alone, considering they may feel like they're overreacting. i don't think you're an AH, and i don't think she is either. you now know that when she's upset, even if you think it's not a big deal yourself, that she'd like a hug or to be comforted (or just asked if she needs anything / if she's okay). i feel like NAH applies pretty well for this situation.", "It\u2019s different for everyone. Just say I\u2019m sorry sweetie. I didn\u2019t realize you were so upset. And give her a hug.", "i mean bro not even a \"you good?\" LMAO nta but also neither is she,,, its just odd to get up like that imo having no clue if she may have needed you", "I'm going to YTA for not checking on her when the film was finished. All you had to do was ask \"Are you okay?\" and THEN you could go smoke.", "YTA\n\nYou wanna de on that insensitive hill?", "Your girlfriend is moved by something to tears and you get up and go for a smoke? lmao you\u2019re an idiot.", "NTA\n\nNow you know but, many people are moved by a touching story, not technically upset.\n\nShe gets upset. Next time check in.", "Info: does she cry after movies often?\n\nMarley and Me\u2026 you left your girlfriend to cry alone after Marley and Me\u2026 I don\u2019t trust anyone who can brush off Marley and Me that coldly, it made my heartless father sob.", "\u201cHey what\u2019s wrong, do you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going through her head. Obviously she\u2019s feeling some very big emotions and needed your support but you flat out ignored her crying. YTA it\u2019s not hard to check in with your partner", "NTA give me a break all of this because of the ending of a movie. It's not like it was real life situation it was a movie. I hope in the movie there was no fires then she will want you to stop smoking.", "YTA. If your gf - or anyone - is crying, they are upset and the appropriate response, especially if it's someone you truly care about, is compassion. A siimple hug and an \"are you okay?\" would likely have gone a long way. What you did seems really cold.", "Gonna get down voted.  NTA.  It's a fucking movie.  Your girlfriend is being ridiculously childish.", "NTA. Everyone with a soul has been moved to tears by that bloody movie it should come with a freaking warning label. I thought it was a comedy when it came out and watched it with my little sister. The trauma after that was just awful. But no we all sometimes have a little cry at movies and shows we don\u2019t need to be mollycuddled. If she had a real issue she should have brought it up and communicated it like a grown up not huffing like a child", "NTA, it's as you said, it's normal to cry during a movie/tv show, I think your girlfriend was expecting a different reaction and when she didn't get it she got angry, but this is an outsiders perspective so I don't know", "NTA\n\nAny chance something else is bothering her? This seems possibly like a case where she's bothered by something she can't/won't name and the crying was an easy thing to say had upset her. Or, she was crying because she was on edge about something else (a bad day, trouble at work,etc) and you not asking what was wrong meant she didn't get to tell you why she was crying for more than just the movie. I might ask her what's going on and if there is anything else upsetting her. If there's not I guess take it as a lesson and ask what's wrong next time, even if the reason seems obvious. But I don't think you're the A here.", "YTA. \n\nIgnoring someone who is crying? You could at least have said, Good movie eh? I see it has moved you, are you ok?", "You're assuming she cried because of the movie, but it could've actually been something else on her mind. Perhaps the movie reminded her something from her past or present. Maybe there's been something she's been trying to tell you. Could be anything -- all you needed to say was, \"Are you okay? What's wrong?\"\n\nYou had a chance to bond with your girlfriend, help her feel safe, listened to, and loved. Lost your chance. YTA.", "YTA. Doesn\u2019t matter why your partner is crying, it\u2019s the barest bare minimum to give them a hug and check-in that they\u2019re ok, and you didn\u2019t even meet that low bar.", "NTA, it\u2019s a movie \u2026 I would think the same. That being said, it doesn\u2019t exactly scream compassion on your part, I feel like even if you KNEW it was because of the movie you could put an arm around her, give her a kiss and maybe comment on the movie or check it WAS the movie that upset her. Seems like a very weird act to just ignore it completely and go smoke, don\u2019t be so absorbed in yourself and tune in/ interact more", "I\u2019m going with NtA. It was a movie, not a real life situation. If you ignored her and offered no comfort in a real situation that made her upset than I\u2019d say YTA. But her emotions hers to deal with just like anyone else\u2019s.", "\"What was I supposed to do, acknowledge her emotions with a hug or maybe talking about what in the movie made her cry? How dare she want me to connect with her about the movie we just supposedly shared! I needed my nicotine!\"\n\nYTA", "NTA for a person. But you\u2019re not just a person. You\u2019re HER person. And she likes to be comforted at times like these so YTA. However it seems more like a communication issue rather than one or the other being in the wrong. So, now you know for the future she would like you to not ignore her and if you do end up doing that again you will actually be TA.", "I was gonna go with N A H but it's Marley and Me. YTA.", "For the sole question on if you were an asshole, yes YTA. \n\nBut you weren\u2019t one maliciously and I think that matters. Don\u2019t beat yourself up too much about it. \n\nWhen people connect with characters and get emotional during movies, it\u2019s always for a reason. For some it\u2019s as simple as they\u2019re feeling sympathy or general empathy for the characters. For others, it\u2019s because the movie hit something deep inside them. \n\nI\u2019m of the personal belief that if you see your partner going through some emotions, the least you can do/should do is ask them if they\u2019re okay. Maybe they are, maybe they\u2019re not. It opens up the opportunity for dialogue that can be very vulnerable and you learn so much about your partner, as well as showing them that you care. It\u2019s one of those small but important things. \n\nBy walking away and not acknowledging her feelings, you showed you didn\u2019t really care about why she was emotional; that it wasn\u2019t really important to you. She\u2019s being a bit dramatic, but that is a hurtful thing to have shown to you. \n\nYou always have to try to see different perspectives when you\u2019re in a relationship, even if you think the other person is being a tad ridiculous.", "NTA. Wtf it's a movie, are we being serious? I've cried over movies but I didn't woe is me for pity. People actually expect back rubs \"there there\" for this?", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I think crying over tv and movies is silly. Not saying I've never done it, cause I have... But I'd never expect someone to sit next to me and rub my back or something. That's something you should get over in about 30 seconds.", "Seriously, your nicotine hit was so important you couldn\u2019t even give your crying girlfriend a hug before satisfying it? Your priorities are odd. Regardless of why she was crying, offering some comfort shouldn\u2019t have been too much to ask.", "YTA\n\n\"What was I supposed to do?\"\n\nBe a human being with empathy for your partner? Damn man, that's cold.", "YTA. You watched Marley & Me and didn't even offer a tissue? She definitely felt like you prioritized smoking over her in that moment cuz that's what happened. Just apologize for not showing more compassion or even asking if she was okay or needed anything. And try to do better in the future. \n\nJust because it doesn't seem like it should matter doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Moments like this tell someone about your character. Too many moments like this will lead someone to feel like you don't care in the ways they need you to care. It mattered to her that it didn't matter to you.", "NTA but you\u2019re dense. That was a nice moment to show her how you would embrace her and be supportive.", "NTA but kinda YTA it's just a movie she'll be fine, but this a relationship faux pas, she's going to hold against you and will likely get really pissed if you do it again.", "YTA. its not a big deal (its a movie Iget it) but man at least ask if she is alright..", "i wanted to say N A H but marley and me? bro come on YTA", "YTA. A simple \u2018hey GF, are you ok?\u2019could have gone a long way to show that you are a compassionate BF who actually thinks about her vs going for a smoke.", "YTA, a 2 second hug or you good was all she needed. You may want to review your priorities", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA only because you sound like you just don\u2019t like your girlfriend very much. I get you might not think crying after a movie is a big deal, but she was upset and obviously wanted comfort from you. You just sound like you don\u2019t want to be compassionate when it\u2019s inconvenient for you.", "YTA.  Whether you think it's just a movie is a bit of a parenthetical point.  It obviously moved her emotionally and running off to smoke seems more than a little bit callous.  Doubling down and saying that it wasn't a big deal wasn't the most empathetic statement in the world, either.", "YTA. Your girlfriend was crying because something in the movie struck a chord with her and moved her to tears. It's an empathetic, emotional trait. Something you are clearly lacking.", "YTA  Life lesson: Person cries - partner comforts. No matter the reason.", "YTA for posting here instead of just taking this as new information about your partner and resolving to do things differently next time. Why does she need to be wrong and you right?", "YTA for just straight up ignoring and not acknowledging it. But instead of an argument I think it can be a conversation about what kind of response from you she was hoping for, if that makes sense for you and hopefully avoid this next time", "NTA. Some people cry to make others want to comfort them. Some people cry because it was a really good movie, and they want to take a moment to appreciate it. I\u2019ve cried at a few movies and if anyone ever called me out or comforted me about it, I would immediately feel embarrassed.\n\nIf she wanted you to comfort her then she should have asked, or reached out, or signaled for it.", "are you dating a 13 year old? Jesus.", "NAH. It probably wasn\u2019t a great move. But it\u2019s really just a difference in people. Talk through it like adults. Next time she cries during a movie, maybe offer some kind of comfort.", "Eh... NAH \n\nSeems to me like a communication issue. You failed to confirm that her crying was about the movie. Maybe she felt hurt by that and would prefer comfort or at least a check-in. Maybe she wanted to talk about what exactly made her cry, but she could've said that instead of icing you out. \n\nI think a conversation needs to be had about both of your expectations when one of you feels or seems emotionally vulnerable, and how you can address and resolve hurt feelings without giving the cold shoulder.", "NAH  \nI have a clear memory of watching a really sad episode of a TV show (His wife was shot!  while they were all on the phone and listening!) and my dad looking over at me and mum, exclaiming 'really, you two?' then going and getting us a box of tissues for the tears running down our faces.  We didn't need comforting - we knew it was fictional - but the acknowledgement that we were feeling some sort of way was a nice thing.    \nYou didn't realise your girlfriend wanted comfort after the sad ending of a fictional dog, she can explain her expectations when she's feeling less fragile.", "NTA. It was just a movie. I cry over movies all the time and don't expect my hubby to coddle me.", "Yta\nAt least be with her, you don't even have to do anything, just sit with her while she cries\nAnd all the people saying nta are also the people who don't cry during movies, think about your gf's perspective", "YTA. A big one. You clearly don\u2019t understand what people closest to you need from you. Stop being a little boy and man up.", "I\u2019ll cry from a movie on occasion (god damn if those prolonged goodbyes they build up from a million miles away don\u2019t always get me.) and I would be fucking mortified if somebody tried to comfort me. It\u2019s just the culmination of a character\u2019s journey that I got emotionally invested in, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m actually upset. \n\nNAH. Some people want a shoulder to cry on, some don\u2019t. Your GF is the kind who wants support and now you know for the future.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH. I cry like a baby when I watch certain movies and I\u2019ll want comfort then. But I also cry when I watch other movies and I don\u2019t want comfort. It truly depends on the person. The best thing to do is say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t comfort you. I\u2019ll keep in mind that you want comfort after an emotional movie and I\u2019ll try to provide that next time\u201d and move on. Communication is key", "It\u2019s not fair of her to assume you would know how to handle the situation. When I\u2019m crying because of a movie, you better not even fucking LOOK IN MY DIRECTION. You look everywhere BUT AT ME. \n\nEveryone is so different. \n\nNTA. But if you do it again, YTA", "Hold her, talk to her, acknowledge her feelings, move her hair from her eyes. Anything loving and tender, and no smoking and ignoring her doesn't count YTA", "YTA. Just comfort your gf instead of being insensitive. And when she tells you that you messed up when she needed comfort don't dismiss her feelings.", "NTA. You failed her test. It burns my butt when women (I'm a woman) weaponoze their tears. Playing games. Then get mad when you don't baby her.", "YTA\n\nYou should\u2019ve at least asked her if she was ok or wanted to talk about it. Yeesh", "YTA it\u2019s not that hard to at least ask \u201chey what is wrong\u201d \n\nThe fact that you didn\u2019t at least *attempt* is why she is ignoring you. \n\n\nCome on man. Bare minimum is a hug", "YTA\n\nYou're supposed to take an interest in how your SO feels. If they don't feel good, you're supposed to comfort them.", "Nta. \n\nFrom now on screen all movies and TV shows you watch.  Refuse to watch anything emotional.  \n\nYou can get emotional over a movie that is fine but expecting attention for a emotion felt for something else is ridiculous, you cannot be held to third party emotions.  If she was emotional over something that was effecting her you would have a reason to react, then you would be the AH if your role is to be her emotional support system.", "IF she's this upset I'm going to assume she's not a crier. That being the case, your assumption was wow...so...wow..If she were the crying type and everything moved her to tears then yeah, go smoke. But if she's not the crying type, and something in that movie unlocked a core memory for her and you just callously walked away? You may have just fucked your whole relationship up.\n\nSorry dude but YTA and you owe her a huge apology.", "Nta\u2026  there are far too many adult babies that need to be coddled over the most trivial nonsense. ET still makes me cry, I don\u2019t need a hug when I watch ET though.", "It takes one second to say, \"Hey, I'm here if you need to talk if something is wrong.\" I'm stuck in the middle with this because I think if someone if crying (that you care about), YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY check up on them. At the same time, it's just a movie, and she will get over it. I could understand if it made her feel scared or uncomfortable and why she would want you as protection if that makes sense. Anyway, I say it depends on the movie and who the person is to you. (<<<<Like, how much you really care about her.)", "YTA\n\nEven if you knew it was because of a movie doesn't mean you just ignore someone crying, especially someone close to you like a girlfriend. Depending on what part of the movie got her emotional, she probably could've used someone to talk about out her thoughts at the time. Or maybe she could've just used a hug. Hard to say since you didn't ask what was up when you noticed her crying next to you.\n\nCrying is an emotional release. Walking away so she was alone to process those emotions is completely oblivious at best, heartless at worst.", "YTA for completely ignoring it. You don\u2019t have to make a big deal out of it but your GF is literally crying, why would you not be like \u201chey you ok?\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s serious or not just take interest in your girl man", "YTA, there may have been a reason why this particular movie made her cry. I watched \"A Man Called Otto\" on the plane this past Tuesday. Movie is about a man dealing with the grief of losing his wife. As a fairly recent widow, this movie had me quietly sobbing as I could relate.\n\nThere may have been something about the movie that triggered a sad memory. You should have asked her if she was okay, and did she want to talk about it.", "If she cries at the drop of a hat, NTA. Can't comfort her all the time.\n\nIf she's not that emotional normally or just an average level of emotion then YTA. Regardless of whether you think it's stupid (the crying at the movie, the movie itself, etc.) part of being a SO is responding to a change in emotion.\n\nIf you cried and she just walked away how would you feel? Maybe your answer it - I would never cry at such a stupid thing. Welp and what if you were super excited or happy about something and she was like that's stupid and walked away? Same thing.", "NTA, sorry, but her reaction is immature. Just because you pop out some tears doesn't mean you need attention. Especially when it's movie related.", "NTA. your girlfriend is being very immature for expecting you to console her about her crying over a movie. it just seems like she cried for the attention and when she didnt get the attention she was upset.", "YTA. You did the wrong thing by being insensitive. I am almost 3 times your age. What you should have done upon seeing her crying was to pull her close to you, wrapped your arm around her and held her during her emotional outbreak and she stopped crying. What she needed was some comforting and not being ignored.", "NTA- it\u2019s a movie, she needs to grow up.  And keep an eye out for attention seeking behavior generally.", "YTA. Sometimes a movie can be a trigger, so can a book, a photograph, a piece of music or even a particular sound or smell. In those moments, if someone we care about has an emotional response i.e. crying...we generally ask if they're ok, if there's anything we can do to help, offer general reassurance that we're there if they need us to be. Walking out just to go have a smoke will generally be seen as cold and uncaring. I hope this helps you in your quandary. \n\nTLDR : Treat your partner like she's a human being with emotions instead of acting like \"meh, not my problem\".", "YTA \n\nshe wanted comfort from her partner, and you basically shrugged and made her think her feelings mean nothing.", "YTA. \n\nMy husband comforted me and our kids after we bawled our eyes out at Hatchi, even if it was just a movie. \n\nShowing empathy won't kill you.", "My partner laughs at me when I cry over a movie.

My step dad sees this and definitely don't ask her If she is okay everytime. She does not expect it either. It's obvious as to why she is crying and that she is okay. If she wasn't, she would definitely tell him, not expect him to just know. \n\nHowever, if she did not cry at movies so easily, and then did all of a sudden, he would definitely be up and making sure she was okay in a heartbeat, but if he didn't see her or something, she would definitely speak up and say what is bothering her and he would listen and talk about it. \nIt's called good communication.", "Nta.

I had an ex who insisted we watch the Fault In Our Stars, yes it was a good movie like he said, but so sad and I had to fight so hard to not sob. One - cause it was a sad movie and two-I could relate to it so it was terrible. This is the reason I don\u2019t like watching war movies, haven\u2019t seen My Sisters Keeper, Marley and Me and A Star is Born. I don\u2019t want to cry and feel those sad things. It\u2019s so silly, but just the way I was built. Even though I know I would like all those movies.", "OP would give more info if that was even in the picture", "It makes me so happy that I\u2019m not the only one. \ud83d\ude02", "I explain woman's emotions to men like this.\n\nWomen have buckets. A bucket for happy, a bucket for sad, mad, stressed and every other emotion there is. These buckets are all different sizes and can vary from woman to woman, some can hold more of a certain emotion than others ect. But the thing that is the same is once that bucket is full and can't hold any more of that emotion, it spills over ie we cry, this is with all of our buckets. Our crying will probably look different depending on which bucket is overflowing but we'll be crying.", "Me too - and I don't want to seem weak, I just want to seem angry lol", "Well you have to cry because murder is illegal and orange is almost no one's color... I took am an angry crier.", "Yeah, I know the name of the sub is AITA so you're searching for a label, but a lot of these situations aren't black and white. He wasn't necessarily an asshole for not figuring out what she wanted but he didn't even try to acknowledge her while she was crying? That's the misstep. If she wanted to be left alone, he could have given her a chance to say that instead of just walking out. \n\nI know I couldn't leave the room without confirmation my partner was okay if they were upset.", "Yeah this. His comments at the end like dismissing her even though she voiced that it was important to her, and then \"What was I meant to do?\" like, wtf? She's clearly showing you what she wants you to do: show that you care, support!\n\nIt's fine to have different expectations but all the rest of the situation just screams that OP is bad at empathy and bad at being there for others in the case OP doesn't himself get it.\n\nYTA", "When was she supposed to tell him lol? He left for a smoke", "You're putting words in his mouth... the dude never said he thought anything was dumb", "Its a fucking movie you dolt. The dog is fucking fine, all of the the dogs they used to film it are ok. She can go through her feels without someone babying her. Just because she's a girl doesn't mean she's not a person and needs a strong man to help her. He wasn't as affected by it as she was, she's still gonna wake up next to him, not you, stop acting like women are objects. The fuck?", "There\u2019s no harm in asking. She might have been reminded about something in real life, and in either cade just appreciated that he cares about her.", "It was Home Alone... the old man got to her.", "Another movie but this one was not expected and therefore was **NOT OKAY**\u2026.COCO! This shit was unacceptable. It was funny, colorful, amazing music, and an amazing story. Heartwarming, funny and everything you expect from a Disney/Pixar movie. And then the ending hits you and you are BAWLING! UNACCEPTABLE! It was sad and had us crying. It was a tearjerker and I was just not expecting to be all in my feels, deep, DEEP in them thangs! Coco was NOT OKAY! But I loved it!", "i feel this way about spirit lol i don\u2019t even know what it was, but i know it made me so sad i only had to watch it once as a little kid", "Hugs to you.", "I went with my 30 yr old daughter to see the Toy Story movie where Andy gives his toys to the little girl. My daughter was SOBBING, loud, gulping sobs. I mean, I teared up, but she was nuts.  She laughed about it after.", "I was interested in the website idea so I visited and found a list of movies that include \"fat suits\". This website is hilarious.", "How could you not?! They were all so horrifically sad!!", "Lol around here I\u2019ve heard \u201comg mom it\u2019s literally coffee\u201d haha", "Wait can you explain to me how he can do something after the act happened?\n\nI would get it if it happens again and he doesn\u2019t do shit, but how does your comment make sense?\nHe wanted to talk about it, she ignored him like a little kid.", "Gee", "It\u2019s not a gender thing. He could have given her a hug and a kiss and asked, \u201dhey are you okay\u201d to show her support and then gone out for a smoke.", "You sound mad", "Then she should\u2019ve used her big girl words and communicated that when he tried to talk to her afterwards instead of ignoring him.", "Jesus can no one tell it\u2019s sarcasm, anyways i disagree with the whole ass hole thing and so do quite a lot of people here, It\u2019s a movie after all and appears to be the first time, i wouldn\u2019t call him an AH.", "Oh really??", "My partner mainly cries when he's happy and it's just so sweet. One of his favorite games recently had a new release and he got so excited he started to cry, I love him so much. So glad he's able to show his emotions and be himself", "I did a rewatch a few weeks ago. I completely lost it. Blubbering.", "Was that supposed to be a rebuttal? You don\u2019t seem very mature lol", "Yes exactly. It\u2019s actually disheartening to see all these people going \u201cit\u2019s a movie whatever!!\u201d", "well sometimes when you\u2019re crying you can\u2019t use your words right away. and need a moment to collect yourself, probably the exact moment OP decided to ignore it and go have a smoke.", "That is so adorable \ud83e\udd70", "It's Diablo 4 isn't it?", "So...you're saying he gave her a moment to collect herself?", "He is!!!", "It's final fantasy crisis core! (I think? I'm not too familiar with all of the names but the recently released one with Zack's story in it. So happy he talked to me about it so I could buy it for him haha he's so cute \ud83d\ude2d)", "no, he literally left to go have a smoke. it wasn\u2019t to give her a moment. he went to have a smoke. if op was giving her a moment, he would have said so. but he said \u201ci didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it\u201d.\n\ntypically if you want to give people a moment you go \u201chey do you need a moment?\u201d instead of getting up and leaving without saying anything \n\nbut hey, whatever you want to believe to make you the correct one even though i\u2019m just stating my own opinion, more power to you bud", "Ahh ok, hope he's enjoying it \ud83d\ude0a", "No need to be so aggro my man", "i\u2019m just. just stating my opinion. you\u2019re the one reading into my tone, my guy", "Not reading into it dawg"]}
