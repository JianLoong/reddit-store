Like daily. It\u2019s very easy to move me to tears, happy or sad. I don\u2019t want/need to be comforted, and it would be tiresome if my poor husband had to try to comfort me every time \ud83d\ude02\n\nI say NAH. Clearly people are just different on this and need to communicate preferences/expectations.", "NAH I think this is just a normal difference in people. Personally I don't want to be comforted if I cry at a movie, but I can understand some people might. Just apologize and tell her you'll keep in mind her preference for the future, and then you know, actually comfort her the next time she cries at a movie.", "INFO: what was the movie?", "Honestly, NAH\n\nI hate when anyone acknowledges I'm crying at a movie. I'm shocked anyone would want to make it a whole discussion - I would rather die than go any further than \"Well the beginning of UP sure hits the feelings doesn't it!\"\n\nHowever, she clearly has a different expectation in her mind. Worth having a conversation about when she might want your support, and get on the same page about it. No one is wrong, just be open and honest about it. Hell, maybe something about the movie struck some kind of emotional cord with her that she really wanted to talk about.", "NAH.\n\nI do think you could have acknowledged that she was crying though. You live in the same space, I would consider it common courtesy.", "NTA. Everyone responds to movies differently", "My bf and I watch a lot of movies, and I tend to cry during heartfelt scenes or death scenes, and he\u2019ll literally laugh at me, and I laugh with him. Some scenes are meant to make you cry, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big deal \n\nUnless it was something trauma-related for her, I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d need to comfort her? It\u2019s a movie\nNTA", "I see her point and yours, she may have just wanted some comforting.", "Honestly baffled at the Y T A responses.\n\nMovies make people cry.  It's normal.  It's also normal to give them space to compose themselves.\n\nYou behaved exactly the same as I'd expect from any of my friends or family.\n\nNTA", "Jesus people... Everyone changing their judgement after they found out the movie is Marley and me.... Look am a massive animal lover and animals are my weak spot. I am a massive crier.. I even cry when people on TV shows and movies have happy moments. But my God to act like this because a guy didn't comfort his gf after a movie especially Marley and me!??? Come on now yall...\n\nOP NTA. My bf also doesn't make a huge deal if I cry that doesn't mean he doesn't care or have compassion. In other life situation he is also there for me and he is the only person I can go to when I actually cry and need someone. People need to get a fucking grip in this sub. It's okay your gf wanted you to console her but to ignore you completely because you didn't after she cried in a movie is much. Her first reaction was to ignore you. I feel this is some wierd tik tok thing where you go to test your bf to see if they care about you.", "Well, now you know what her expectations are. Next time put your arm around her or something.", "NTA. These ppl saying you are, are ridiculous. There\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing someone to sit with their emotions for a bit after a movie. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Lots of ppl get emotional at tearjerkers, they\u2019re called that for a reason, and I don\u2019t really think you\u2019re obligated to query them about it. If she wants or needs something, or it\u2019s more than the movie, then she\u2019s an adult and has a mouth. Not this \u201cI\u2019m going to cry and hope he asks me why and when he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to punish him\u201d crap.", "You can just use this as an opportunity to learn what kind of partner your girlfriend is telling you she needs. If taking a few minutes to fawn over her and be attentive makes her feel loved within the relationship, you now know that she needs that. People have different love languages, and it's not always second nature to know someone else's.", "It doesn\u2019t take much effort to offer a \u201cHey, you good?\u201d even when you know it was triggered by a sad movie. It\u2019s a small gesture that shows your partner that you pay attention to them and care about them. Maybe the movie made her remember something troubling in her past, maybe she was just empathizing with the plot/characters. Who knows. You certainly won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t ask. \n\nI\u2019m tempted to go Y T A but I\u2019ll settle for NAH since I don\u2019t think you were intentionally choosing to neglect your partner in a time of need and IF you thought she was in genuine distress (not just movie related), you would have said something. Be there for your partner even if you think the reason is superficial. The smallest gestures often mean the most.", "INFO\n\nSince it was Marley and me, did she go through similar and it brought up sad memories for her and so she feels you just dismissed how she felt (so it ***wasn't*** the movie that made her cry, it was what it reminded her of)\n\nI'm still going NTA, but a simple \"are you ok\" wouldn't go amiss", "i mean, i needed a hug after watching marley and me (i checked the comments to see if the movie was mentioned) so i could totally understand her needing one too considering just how tearjerking that movie is.\n\nbut i also know some other people who would rather be left alone, considering they may feel like they're overreacting. i don't think you're an AH, and i don't think she is either. you now know that when she's upset, even if you think it's not a big deal yourself, that she'd like a hug or to be comforted (or just asked if she needs anything / if she's okay). i feel like NAH applies pretty well for this situation.", "It\u2019s different for everyone. Just say I\u2019m sorry sweetie. I didn\u2019t realize you were so upset. And give her a hug.", "i mean bro not even a \"you good?\" LMAO nta but also neither is she,,, its just odd to get up like that imo having no clue if she may have needed you", "I'm going to YTA for not checking on her when the film was finished. All you had to do was ask \"Are you okay?\" and THEN you could go smoke.", "YTA\n\nYou wanna de on that insensitive hill?", "Your girlfriend is moved by something to tears and you get up and go for a smoke? lmao you\u2019re an idiot.", "NTA\n\nNow you know but, many people are moved by a touching story, not technically upset.\n\nShe gets upset. Next time check in.", "Info: does she cry after movies often?\n\nMarley and Me\u2026 you left your girlfriend to cry alone after Marley and Me\u2026 I don\u2019t trust anyone who can brush off Marley and Me that coldly, it made my heartless father sob.", "\u201cHey what\u2019s wrong, do you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going through her head. Obviously she\u2019s feeling some very big emotions and needed your support but you flat out ignored her crying. YTA it\u2019s not hard to check in with your partner", "NTA give me a break all of this because of the ending of a movie. It's not like it was real life situation it was a movie. I hope in the movie there was no fires then she will want you to stop smoking.", "YTA. If your gf - or anyone - is crying, they are upset and the appropriate response, especially if it's someone you truly care about, is compassion. A siimple hug and an \"are you okay?\" would likely have gone a long way. What you did seems really cold.", "Gonna get down voted.  NTA.  It's a fucking movie.  Your girlfriend is being ridiculously childish.", "NTA. Everyone with a soul has been moved to tears by that bloody movie it should come with a freaking warning label. I thought it was a comedy when it came out and watched it with my little sister. The trauma after that was just awful. But no we all sometimes have a little cry at movies and shows we don\u2019t need to be mollycuddled. If she had a real issue she should have brought it up and communicated it like a grown up not huffing like a child", "NTA, it's as you said, it's normal to cry during a movie/tv show, I think your girlfriend was expecting a different reaction and when she didn't get it she got angry, but this is an outsiders perspective so I don't know", "NTA\n\nAny chance something else is bothering her? This seems possibly like a case where she's bothered by something she can't/won't name and the crying was an easy thing to say had upset her. Or, she was crying because she was on edge about something else (a bad day, trouble at work,etc) and you not asking what was wrong meant she didn't get to tell you why she was crying for more than just the movie. I might ask her what's going on and if there is anything else upsetting her. If there's not I guess take it as a lesson and ask what's wrong next time, even if the reason seems obvious. But I don't think you're the A here.", "YTA. \n\nIgnoring someone who is crying? You could at least have said, Good movie eh? I see it has moved you, are you ok?", "You're assuming she cried because of the movie, but it could've actually been something else on her mind. Perhaps the movie reminded her something from her past or present. Maybe there's been something she's been trying to tell you. Could be anything -- all you needed to say was, \"Are you okay? What's wrong?\"\n\nYou had a chance to bond with your girlfriend, help her feel safe, listened to, and loved. Lost your chance. YTA.", "YTA. Doesn\u2019t matter why your partner is crying, it\u2019s the barest bare minimum to give them a hug and check-in that they\u2019re ok, and you didn\u2019t even meet that low bar.", "NTA, it\u2019s a movie \u2026 I would think the same. That being said, it doesn\u2019t exactly scream compassion on your part, I feel like even if you KNEW it was because of the movie you could put an arm around her, give her a kiss and maybe comment on the movie or check it WAS the movie that upset her. Seems like a very weird act to just ignore it completely and go smoke, don\u2019t be so absorbed in yourself and tune in/ interact more", "I\u2019m going with NtA. It was a movie, not a real life situation. If you ignored her and offered no comfort in a real situation that made her upset than I\u2019d say YTA. But her emotions hers to deal with just like anyone else\u2019s.", "\"What was I supposed to do, acknowledge her emotions with a hug or maybe talking about what in the movie made her cry? How dare she want me to connect with her about the movie we just supposedly shared! I needed my nicotine!\"\n\nYTA", "NTA for a person. But you\u2019re not just a person. You\u2019re HER person. And she likes to be comforted at times like these so YTA. However it seems more like a communication issue rather than one or the other being in the wrong. So, now you know for the future she would like you to not ignore her and if you do end up doing that again you will actually be TA.", "I was gonna go with N A H but it's Marley and Me. YTA.", "For the sole question on if you were an asshole, yes YTA. \n\nBut you weren\u2019t one maliciously and I think that matters. Don\u2019t beat yourself up too much about it. \n\nWhen people connect with characters and get emotional during movies, it\u2019s always for a reason. For some it\u2019s as simple as they\u2019re feeling sympathy or general empathy for the characters. For others, it\u2019s because the movie hit something deep inside them. \n\nI\u2019m of the personal belief that if you see your partner going through some emotions, the least you can do/should do is ask them if they\u2019re okay. Maybe they are, maybe they\u2019re not. It opens up the opportunity for dialogue that can be very vulnerable and you learn so much about your partner, as well as showing them that you care. It\u2019s one of those small but important things. \n\nBy walking away and not acknowledging her feelings, you showed you didn\u2019t really care about why she was emotional; that it wasn\u2019t really important to you. She\u2019s being a bit dramatic, but that is a hurtful thing to have shown to you. \n\nYou always have to try to see different perspectives when you\u2019re in a relationship, even if you think the other person is being a tad ridiculous.", "NTA. Wtf it's a movie, are we being serious? I've cried over movies but I didn't woe is me for pity. People actually expect back rubs \"there there\" for this?", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I think crying over tv and movies is silly. Not saying I've never done it, cause I have... But I'd never expect someone to sit next to me and rub my back or something. That's something you should get over in about 30 seconds.", "Seriously, your nicotine hit was so important you couldn\u2019t even give your crying girlfriend a hug before satisfying it? Your priorities are odd. Regardless of why she was crying, offering some comfort shouldn\u2019t have been too much to ask.", "YTA\n\n\"What was I supposed to do?\"\n\nBe a human being with empathy for your partner? Damn man, that's cold.", "YTA. You watched Marley & Me and didn't even offer a tissue? She definitely felt like you prioritized smoking over her in that moment cuz that's what happened. Just apologize for not showing more compassion or even asking if she was okay or needed anything. And try to do better in the future. \n\nJust because it doesn't seem like it should matter doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Moments like this tell someone about your character. Too many moments like this will lead someone to feel like you don't care in the ways they need you to care. It mattered to her that it didn't matter to you.", "NTA but you\u2019re dense. That was a nice moment to show her how you would embrace her and be supportive.", "NTA but kinda YTA it's just a movie she'll be fine, but this a relationship faux pas, she's going to hold against you and will likely get really pissed if you do it again.", "YTA. its not a big deal (its a movie Iget it) but man at least ask if she is alright..", "i wanted to say N A H but marley and me? bro come on YTA", "YTA. A simple \u2018hey GF, are you ok?\u2019could have gone a long way to show that you are a compassionate BF who actually thinks about her vs going for a smoke.", "YTA, a 2 second hug or you good was all she needed. You may want to review your priorities", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA only because you sound like you just don\u2019t like your girlfriend very much. I get you might not think crying after a movie is a big deal, but she was upset and obviously wanted comfort from you. You just sound like you don\u2019t want to be compassionate when it\u2019s inconvenient for you.", "YTA.  Whether you think it's just a movie is a bit of a parenthetical point.  It obviously moved her emotionally and running off to smoke seems more than a little bit callous.  Doubling down and saying that it wasn't a big deal wasn't the most empathetic statement in the world, either.", "YTA. Your girlfriend was crying because something in the movie struck a chord with her and moved her to tears. It's an empathetic, emotional trait. Something you are clearly lacking.", "YTA  Life lesson: Person cries - partner comforts. No matter the reason.", "YTA for posting here instead of just taking this as new information about your partner and resolving to do things differently next time. Why does she need to be wrong and you right?", "YTA for just straight up ignoring and not acknowledging it. But instead of an argument I think it can be a conversation about what kind of response from you she was hoping for, if that makes sense for you and hopefully avoid this next time", "NTA. Some people cry to make others want to comfort them. Some people cry because it was a really good movie, and they want to take a moment to appreciate it. I\u2019ve cried at a few movies and if anyone ever called me out or comforted me about it, I would immediately feel embarrassed.\n\nIf she wanted you to comfort her then she should have asked, or reached out, or signaled for it.", "are you dating a 13 year old? Jesus.", "NAH. It probably wasn\u2019t a great move. But it\u2019s really just a difference in people. Talk through it like adults. Next time she cries during a movie, maybe offer some kind of comfort.", "Eh... NAH \n\nSeems to me like a communication issue. You failed to confirm that her crying was about the movie. Maybe she felt hurt by that and would prefer comfort or at least a check-in. Maybe she wanted to talk about what exactly made her cry, but she could've said that instead of icing you out. \n\nI think a conversation needs to be had about both of your expectations when one of you feels or seems emotionally vulnerable, and how you can address and resolve hurt feelings without giving the cold shoulder.", "NAH  \nI have a clear memory of watching a really sad episode of a TV show (His wife was shot!  while they were all on the phone and listening!) and my dad looking over at me and mum, exclaiming 'really, you two?' then going and getting us a box of tissues for the tears running down our faces.  We didn't need comforting - we knew it was fictional - but the acknowledgement that we were feeling some sort of way was a nice thing.    \nYou didn't realise your girlfriend wanted comfort after the sad ending of a fictional dog, she can explain her expectations when she's feeling less fragile.", "NTA. It was just a movie. I cry over movies all the time and don't expect my hubby to coddle me.", "Yta\nAt least be with her, you don't even have to do anything, just sit with her while she cries\nAnd all the people saying nta are also the people who don't cry during movies, think about your gf's perspective", "YTA. A big one. You clearly don\u2019t understand what people closest to you need from you. Stop being a little boy and man up.", "I\u2019ll cry from a movie on occasion (god damn if those prolonged goodbyes they build up from a million miles away don\u2019t always get me.) and I would be fucking mortified if somebody tried to comfort me. It\u2019s just the culmination of a character\u2019s journey that I got emotionally invested in, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m actually upset. \n\nNAH. Some people want a shoulder to cry on, some don\u2019t. Your GF is the kind who wants support and now you know for the future.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH. I cry like a baby when I watch certain movies and I\u2019ll want comfort then. But I also cry when I watch other movies and I don\u2019t want comfort. It truly depends on the person. The best thing to do is say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t comfort you. I\u2019ll keep in mind that you want comfort after an emotional movie and I\u2019ll try to provide that next time\u201d and move on. Communication is key", "It\u2019s not fair of her to assume you would know how to handle the situation. When I\u2019m crying because of a movie, you better not even fucking LOOK IN MY DIRECTION. You look everywhere BUT AT ME. \n\nEveryone is so different. \n\nNTA. But if you do it again, YTA", "Hold her, talk to her, acknowledge her feelings, move her hair from her eyes. Anything loving and tender, and no smoking and ignoring her doesn't count YTA", "YTA. Just comfort your gf instead of being insensitive. And when she tells you that you messed up when she needed comfort don't dismiss her feelings.", "NTA. You failed her test. It burns my butt when women (I'm a woman) weaponoze their tears. Playing games. Then get mad when you don't baby her.", "YTA\n\nYou should\u2019ve at least asked her if she was ok or wanted to talk about it. Yeesh", "YTA it\u2019s not that hard to at least ask \u201chey what is wrong\u201d \n\nThe fact that you didn\u2019t at least *attempt* is why she is ignoring you. \n\n\nCome on man. Bare minimum is a hug", "YTA\n\nYou're supposed to take an interest in how your SO feels. If they don't feel good, you're supposed to comfort them.", "Nta. \n\nFrom now on screen all movies and TV shows you watch.  Refuse to watch anything emotional.  \n\nYou can get emotional over a movie that is fine but expecting attention for a emotion felt for something else is ridiculous, you cannot be held to third party emotions.  If she was emotional over something that was effecting her you would have a reason to react, then you would be the AH if your role is to be her emotional support system.", "IF she's this upset I'm going to assume she's not a crier. That being the case, your assumption was wow...so...wow..If she were the crying type and everything moved her to tears then yeah, go smoke. But if she's not the crying type, and something in that movie unlocked a core memory for her and you just callously walked away? You may have just fucked your whole relationship up.\n\nSorry dude but YTA and you owe her a huge apology.", "Nta\u2026  there are far too many adult babies that need to be coddled over the most trivial nonsense. ET still makes me cry, I don\u2019t need a hug when I watch ET though.", "It takes one second to say, \"Hey, I'm here if you need to talk if something is wrong.\" I'm stuck in the middle with this because I think if someone if crying (that you care about), YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY check up on them. At the same time, it's just a movie, and she will get over it. I could understand if it made her feel scared or uncomfortable and why she would want you as protection if that makes sense. Anyway, I say it depends on the movie and who the person is to you. (<<<<Like, how much you really care about her.)", "YTA\n\nEven if you knew it was because of a movie doesn't mean you just ignore someone crying, especially someone close to you like a girlfriend. Depending on what part of the movie got her emotional, she probably could've used someone to talk about out her thoughts at the time. Or maybe she could've just used a hug. Hard to say since you didn't ask what was up when you noticed her crying next to you.\n\nCrying is an emotional release. Walking away so she was alone to process those emotions is completely oblivious at best, heartless at worst.", "YTA for completely ignoring it. You don\u2019t have to make a big deal out of it but your GF is literally crying, why would you not be like \u201chey you ok?\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s serious or not just take interest in your girl man", "YTA, there may have been a reason why this particular movie made her cry. I watched \"A Man Called Otto\" on the plane this past Tuesday. Movie is about a man dealing with the grief of losing his wife. As a fairly recent widow, this movie had me quietly sobbing as I could relate.\n\nThere may have been something about the movie that triggered a sad memory. You should have asked her if she was okay, and did she want to talk about it.", "If she cries at the drop of a hat, NTA. Can't comfort her all the time.\n\nIf she's not that emotional normally or just an average level of emotion then YTA. Regardless of whether you think it's stupid (the crying at the movie, the movie itself, etc.) part of being a SO is responding to a change in emotion.\n\nIf you cried and she just walked away how would you feel? Maybe your answer it - I would never cry at such a stupid thing. Welp and what if you were super excited or happy about something and she was like that's stupid and walked away? Same thing.", "NTA, sorry, but her reaction is immature. Just because you pop out some tears doesn't mean you need attention. Especially when it's movie related.", "NTA. your girlfriend is being very immature for expecting you to console her about her crying over a movie. it just seems like she cried for the attention and when she didnt get the attention she was upset.", "YTA. You did the wrong thing by being insensitive. I am almost 3 times your age. What you should have done upon seeing her crying was to pull her close to you, wrapped your arm around her and held her during her emotional outbreak and she stopped crying. What she needed was some comforting and not being ignored.", "NTA- it\u2019s a movie, she needs to grow up.  And keep an eye out for attention seeking behavior generally.", "YTA. Sometimes a movie can be a trigger, so can a book, a photograph, a piece of music or even a particular sound or smell. In those moments, if someone we care about has an emotional response i.e. crying...we generally ask if they're ok, if there's anything we can do to help, offer general reassurance that we're there if they need us to be. Walking out just to go have a smoke will generally be seen as cold and uncaring. I hope this helps you in your quandary. \n\nTLDR : Treat your partner like she's a human being with emotions instead of acting like \"meh, not my problem\".", "YTA \n\nshe wanted comfort from her partner, and you basically shrugged and made her think her feelings mean nothing.", "YTA. \n\nMy husband comforted me and our kids after we bawled our eyes out at Hatchi, even if it was just a movie. \n\nShowing empathy won't kill you.", "My partner laughs at me when I cry over a movie.

My step dad sees this and definitely don't ask her If she is okay everytime. She does not expect it either. It's obvious as to why she is crying and that she is okay. If she wasn't, she would definitely tell him, not expect him to just know. \n\nHowever, if she did not cry at movies so easily, and then did all of a sudden, he would definitely be up and making sure she was okay in a heartbeat, but if he didn't see her or something, she would definitely speak up and say what is bothering her and he would listen and talk about it. \nIt's called good communication.", "Nta.

I was travelling with a group and I kid you not there was barely a dry eye on that airplane. The second time I watched it I immediately started crying the second the dog was introduced. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like a hug or anything, I\u2019m not big on needing physical comfort after a sad movie, but even I\u2019d appreciate some sort of acknowledgement of how emotional that movie is jfc. I\u2019d rule a soft YTA tbh.", "I truly underestimated how much Marley & me would mess me up. I KNEW what happened and I still cried both times I\u2019ve seen it. My bff still refuses to watch it to this day.", "I\u2019m weird I guess, I assumed when people cried at movies it\u2019s not a cry that needs comforting. Being moved to tears is the desired outcome when I take in something profound or sad.", "Tf he an a-hole for, it\u2019s just a fcking movie, both you & the gf are just unreasonable to expect your S/O to read your mind or comment on how it was, I would of done thought the exact same thing OP did and I\u2019m a woman cuz bruh, it\u2019s a MOVIE, not a real life situation, for her to such a little tantrum over him not reading her mind on what she wanted him to do is completely childish and unnecessary, if she really wanted his input, she could have started the convo with \u2018wasn\u2019t that movie so sweet & moving\u2019 or explain in a mature adult manner \u2018hey babe, if you could next time say something about the movie we just watched, it mean a lot to me.\u2019 Not give him tf cold shoulder for making such a small mistake. There are more important reasons in a relationship to get upset over like for starters \u2018ACTUAL COMMUNICATION while also giving constructive criticism \u2019.  Instead of\n\n\n\nS/O: *cries*\n\n\nOther S/O:~Movie must of been pretty moving~ *goes to smoke*\n\n\nS/O: ~How dare you not see why I\u2019m crying even though it\u2019s pretty obvious why I\u2019m crying or even approach how the movie made you feel~\n\n\nOther S/O: Wait what?\n\n\nS/O: *ignores S/O for not apologizing for their inability to read their minds*\n\n\nIf OP gf needs somebody who is like her and find it important to do the things you just said then she needs to find that type of person, not chose someone who is clearly isn\u2019t like that or help OP grow in that area.\n\n\nCuz I guarantee doing what OP gf did is going to help cuz here\u2019s OP asking what he did wrong from a bunch of strangers on the internet. He\u2019s young, he\u2019s still learning just like every young person does, so is his gf which is why she isn\u2019t an a-hole either. She\u2019s just a little immature and lacking in understanding communication & patience, OP is lacking in many areas too however that is no reason to label him TA either. Not everybody is a Romeo & Juliet, some couples are like Rip & Beth or Melissa Mcarthy & her husband. \n\n\nLife isn\u2019t a Hallmark movie, it\u2019s life where you actually have to help each other grow, get mad at the other for not taking the trash out or spending too much money at Target cuz the S/O left them unsupervised.", "Without spoiling too much if anything, the movie tracks the natural progression of a young couple buying a puppy and then living their lives and getting older with each other over the years. The conclusion of the movie is strongly bittersweet and melancholic. \n\nI personally don't really think that this movie changes whether or not he's the asshole but apparently some people do, because of how strongly this movie moves them and how consistently.", "My son and I both cry so hard over that movie.", "Oh! Thanks for letting me know. Usually I come to this subreddit to read.", "Especially if you lost a beloved pet in the past.", "No I just say sucks to be you and with he gf it's a movie the ending 9/10 is going to make people cry that's common so OP doesn't need to say anything", "For not magically knowing that she wanted comfort? Nah.", "Why don\u2019t you deal with your multiple mental illnesses first", "Really? You\u2019re literally judging him and that he lacks empathy over leaving when she\u2019s crying over a movie because he should have read her mind that there is some deeper issue \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02.", "Oh then no,never", "Im the bigger crier. My wife will catch me crying without seeing my ear bud in. She thinks im having an episode (mental health issurs) but nope, sad part during audiobook.", "Uhm, I'm sorry, who doesn't it destroy!? \n\nPsychopaths maybe.....", "Yea me and my brothers ( all of us are over 6\u20194\u201d 280 plus guys) the vet scene had the living room quiet and everyone trying to cough or look at our phones lol. Yea I watched it once and called it good!", "I think it depends, if she lost a pet that can influence how much comfort is necessary", "From all the comments about this movie, it's going on my do not watch list! I don't think I could handle it lol", "MAGICALLY \n\nShe was crying. I doN\u2019t UnDeRStanD", "ooh looks like I struck a nerve", "He asked to be judge. I did so. He didn't need to be a mind reader. She was crying.  He was dismissive because *he* didn't feel her tears were a big deal. He didn't have to have empathy for the movie, just his girlfriend.", "Are you sure about that because this is not healthy behavior, is she pregnant? On her period? Anything else that might explain this weird and uncommon behaviors?", "No, none of that. She's been stressed because of work but i don't think it had anything to do with her crying", "I don't know then, all i can suggest is sit down with her, tell her your sorry for not realizing she-needed-comfort, then ask her if there is anything else going on and just generally be supportive.", "Yeah, that's what i'm gonna do. Thanks", "Good luck, i'm hoping it was nothing more than just being sad about the movie."]}
