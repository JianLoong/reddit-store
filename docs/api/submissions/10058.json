Also, you mentioned to someone that she can afford the bill, but then later told someone she only makes $15/hr. \nIf she\u2019s a good roommate and a good friend, splitting the bill would have been in your best interest.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Since I\u2019m already being downvoted, I\u2019d like to add something else. I\u2019m find it disturbing how many people think that this has anything to do with what she charges her friend for rent. Would the situation be different if she paid more? We don\u2019t know anything about why they have made the arrangements they have - maybe the friend is in a tiny ass non-conforming bedroom and it\u2019s priced per square foot.

How could she think she would get to keep taking advantage of your hospitality after refusing to take responsibility for causing Whiskers' hospitalization and need for medication?? I'm livid just reading about the gall of this ex-friend. I'd cut off anyone who takes her side after hearing the whole story, tbh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest wishes for Whiskers' recovery, OP!", "Nta, I am on your side", "NTA and if Nina doesn't pay I'd take her to small claims and make her responsible for the WHOLE thing as it was her damn fault the cat ate tide pods.", "Two months? That's generous. I may have given her one. NTA and I'm glad Whiskers is okay.", "NTA\n\nshe agreed to take care of your cat. so, she was responsable for what happens. the vet visit was not for an illness that she was treated for.\nthe vet visit was an emergency visit because she didn't paid enough attention to no expose your cat to detergent.\nher fault your cat ended up to the vet.In my opinion she should be accountable for the entire vet bill. not just the first meds.\nshe merely paid change as \"rent\", as you say it , mostly the utilities.\n  how I see this should have happened? your friend apologizing, and telling she would find a way to pay for whatever the cost will be, since she was responsable , and that she is very grateful the cat is alive and would eventually be fine.\nI dont think you are an asshole for giving her 2 months to find rent somewhere else, and you are not even cruel. \na pet is family, and family is more important. keep both of you safe and happy!", "NTA.  Give her an eviction notice IN WRITING.", "Please tell us you are standing your ground on this.. what she did was wrong.", "I disagree with others on this and I will say ESH for this situation. She offered to pay half the bill and although it would have been nice for her to pay it all, she clearly should not have been left responsible for your cat. That\u2019s a risk you decided to take. As for the amount of rent she pays you\u2026that\u2019s a seperate issue but it has nothing to do with the cat. (How on earth did you agree to rent for that little???)\n\nThat being said\u2026you are allowed to give her a notice of leave at any time as long as you are not on a contract. For the eviction notice you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't kicking her out because she \"made a mistake\" with the detergent. She's being kicked out because SHE won't pay the vet bill that SHE caused!", "NTA. There is no way to know she won't be careless again and kill your cat.", "NTA. Evict this \u201cfriend\u201c and make her pay ALL OF THE BILL, not just the medication. Take her to small claims court and have her wages (or other form of income, like government assistance) garnished.\n\nedited to say: absolutely force her to move out. Yes, I understand this was an accident. But she was unwilling to try to get the detergent pod to ensure Whisker\u2019s safety, and even worse, she\u2019s not willing to take responsibility for what her lack of actions caused.  If she\u2019s that irresponsible, who knows what she might think \u201cisn\u2019t a big deal\u201d next.", "NTA - if she had rushed the cat straight to the vet the moment she saw him licking the detergent, there may have been less damaged or certain treatments. But she didn\u2019t! She waited until the cat got sick!! You don\u2019t wait for signs of illness! You take them straight away!!! Because overnight observations, is a lot cheaper and less stressful, then what Whiskers had to have done! \n\nLike others said, she\u2019s already bad mouthing you to other people! She either leaves! Or you increase the rent and retain payment that way!", "NTA and if you took her to small claims, she would have to pay it all.", "Nta. \n\nShe is already paying pennies for a big place to share with you, she couldn't live that cheap anywhere else.  The least she could do is to cover all of the vet and med costs because she endangered your pet with carelessness. That alone us near inexcusable.\n\nI'd also tell her to pay the full cost or gtfo.", "NTA\n\nDon't fuck with people's pets and their lives. Housemate fucked up; how lazy do you have to be to not clean up properly? \n\nAs a result of that, your pet could have died. It's sad you even had to ask her to pay half the bill because most decent folk would have offered to contribute.\n\nHold your ground on this. It was an accident, yes, but that's not why you've asked her to move out. If she wants to tell people that and they believe it? Not a you problem. \n\nI hope Whiskers has a speedy recovery!", "NTA. She should be paying the entire bill in full.", "NTA, the super lax rent alone, plus she did cause it, so it's just polite the polite thing to do imo.", "NTA. Kick her ass out!!! She nearly killed your cat. And is wholly taking advantage of you in general.", "Kick her out", "So does your cat tend to eat/lick random things like this? No cat I\u2019ve ever owned has gone after any laundry detergent if they were some how exposed to it. My current cat is the love of my life and I just spent 120 on him having an ear infection\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. He\u2019s as stubborn as they get and will eat anything if you let him but never laundry detergent, he will refuse anything he doesn\u2019t want and will actually knock my meds out of my hands because he doesn\u2019t want me taking them. I hate jumping to conclusions but I just wonder if there\u2019s more to this story. How does she normally treat the cat? NTA.", "NTA. Clearly she doesn't care about Whiskers whom I hope will have a speedy and full recovery.", "NTA\n\nClearly she can't be trusted to be safe around pets, I'd kick her out for that alone", "NTA for kicking her out, your arrangement clearly isn't working for you.\n\nOn the side of the roommate though, I have had cats all my life and wouldn't think cleaning up laundry detergent was urgent because the cat would eat it! What kind of detergent do you guys buy that smells like food to a cat?! That part is super weird!!!", "Well first off; how much is the rent honestly, if it\u2019s $900-$1000 or less and she doesn\u2019t have any pets then that\u2019s acceptable. You should keep better track of your cat honestly, shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get into the laundry room. If you\u2019re not going to bother \u201ckitty proofing\u201d dangerous areas then it\u2019s your fault as much as hers. Should she pay your vet bill? No, maybe something towards it but to ask her to move because your cat doesn\u2019t know not to eat detergent (which is kid of weird because cats usually don\u2019t eat things that smell funny), is not her fault", "From what I read it was an accident, that said she could have had the decency to **offer to pay** some/all of the bill but she didn't.\n\nYou're an AH for demanding she pay, she's half an AH for not offering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rent she pays is not germaine to the issue, if you want her to leave you don't need a reason.", "NTA.  No only did she refused to pay 100% of the vet bill which she totally should be responsible for, but also don\u2019t overlook the possibility of her making careless and stupid mistakes that will endanger or kill your cat in the future if she stays.  Kick her out ASAP.", "If she made an authentic attempt to pick up all of them and clean up the area, then I could chalk it up to an accident, but she knew there was a spot they spilled into and chose not to pick them up.", "Exactly. Many types of harm are accidents but the person who caused it is still held accountable. For example, a car crash is called an \"accident\" not an \"on purpose\".", "I think the roommate should pay the whole bill! NTA", "I'd give her exactly the amount of time mandated by local tenancy laws and not a millisecond longer. NTA at all, she was careless spilling the pods, didn't fully clean them up, was aware the cat had gotten into them and did nothing, only letting your know once the cat was clearly in bad shape.
