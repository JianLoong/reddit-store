Im (25M) and she\u2019s (24F).\n\nMy girlfriend is lovely, but I think she has some sort of undiagnosed OCD or something. She is always frantically running around cleaning things, any spill or anything out of place she rushes to fix it. I don\u2019t let her drive anymore because whenever we drive she has to turn around to make sure she didn\u2019t hit a car or something. She washes her hands multiple times a day until she is sure she can\u2019t see a single spot on it.  Whenever we go out to eat she brings her own hand soap and washes her utensils and plates in the bathroom and is constantly picking at her food. She also counts all the way to 100 multiple times in a row. I told her maybe she should see a professional about this but she shuts me down and says it\u2019s just anxiety, so I just stopped bringing it up.\n\nYesterday, me and her went out for the first time in a while. Like I mentioned before I know how she is with germs and stuff so we usually don\u2019t go out because she is always so anxious. I decided that I would take her to the park and just spend some time together.\n\nWe get to the park and we actually had a great time. She had a few compulsions but they were pretty manageable. Although we had to go to the bathroom every single time she touched anything. \n\nAfter the park I told her we would stop for some dessert. I asked her if she had any suggestions and she said she wanted something cold, so I pulled up to Sweet Frog. We went inside and when she saw the dispensers for the frozen yogurt she immediately looked very anxious. She then said she couldn\u2019t eat it. I asked why and she told me that she would\u2019ve preferred ice cream because they are in wrappers and she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s inside the dispenser. I told her we already drove all the way here and the dispensers were clean and she didn\u2019t have to worry but she just said the same thing but more frantically. I could tell she was about to cry so I told her she could get the frozen yogurt or get nothing at all. She ended up getting the frozen yogurt but she didn\u2019t eat it. As soon as we got back in the car she started crying and telling me that I was so inconsiderate and it\u2019s not much to just drive to another ice cream place. I told her that unless she gave me gas money then I couldn\u2019t drive to the ice cream place which is like 30 minutes away from the sweet frog. She went quiet and she didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the drive. When we got home she immediately shut herself in the bathroom for like 20 minutes and then she went in our room to take a nap. This morning she didn\u2019t even say bye to me when I left for work.\n\nI just think this whole situation is ridiculous. I called my mom and told her the situation and she said that I was TA most definitely. I don\u2019t really think I am as I wasn\u2019t trying to waste gas driving 30 minutes just for ice cream.

NTA", "I'm going to say NAH. Your girlfriend has a mental illness that is seriously impacting her life and relationships. Unless you knew she would have a problem with the frozen yogurt place (like she's had a similar issue at other places) you didn't put her in that situation on purpose. She was likely also really stressed out from being out that day. \nOCD (if that's what she has) is one of the toughest mental illnesses to witness in a loved one because of how much it affects every part of someone's life. It's also understandable that you didn't want to drive to another place. If she's in denial about her mental illness then of course she blames you for her feeling bad instead of blaming her illness.\nI think it's time to talk with her very seriously about finding treatment. Maybe involve her family if you think they'd be supportive.", "NAH \u2014 This is a no win and above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. \n\nShe needs medical intervention and you need direction on how to support from a trained professional.", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, you brought her someplace when she asked for something cold. Frozen yogurt is cold; it's frozen. Mind you I've never heard of this sweet frog place but I worked at a ice cream shop for my first job. We would clean and sanitize every machine after making ice cream from it (I can't assure every place does this), so her freaking out about them beling clean is sort of just her issues inside her own mind. If her reason for freaking out is because ice cream is inside wrappers, wait until she hears about what kind of germs on inside of those wrappers due to machines wrapping thousands of them everyday without being washed in between. And hell, the places with bins that don't even wash the scoops in between flavors!", "NTA, she asked for something cold but never specified what. You simply went with frozen yogurt and she for some reason has issues with it and blames you for the fact that ypu couldn't read her mind when she said she wanted ice cream instead. Also, I think she needs to get help with whatever she is dealing with as it is far from normal and you can only do so much with that, if she is not willing to help herself then it will never get better.", "NTA. She refuses to seek treatment. If she doesn\u2019t need help, then she\u2019s doesn\u2019t need you to drive a half-hour to accommodate her.", "NTA, she has a severe disability that she isn't seeking help for, being around people with extreme OCD is tedious. \nWhy would you drive to 2 different places just because of her.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she is clinical at this point and needs to seek professional guidance and help. As for not wanting to drive 30 minutes to get ice cream, NTA, I definitely wouldn't do it. Not for ice cream. Packaged ice cream is bought in grocery stores. Another ice cream parlor is going to have open containers and people digging in with lightly rinsed ice cream scoops. She won't eat there either.", "NAH, but your girlfriend has a problem and she needs to get it treated. Frankly I think you are just not a good match. Maybe your girlfriend is the A H because you have asked to seek treatment and she refuses. Either way, not your problem. I think maybe you should think really hard about if you want to continue this relationship given the hoops her condition is requiring you to jump through. I personally would make her getting therapy a condition of continuing the relationship.", "NTA.\n\nOCD is serious and debilitating.  That said, she is obviously near non-functional from what you wrote.  Since you write that it is undiagnosed, ... WHY is she not in therapy, taking medication...  Can she not see this is NOT normal and needs to be addressed.  You've been dating for 8 months which is not a long time, but to go further you either suck it up and deal with it.  If she does not want to help herself, and you can't convince her to do something, and you continue like this then maybe you are the AH but for a different reason. (maybe not AH but .....)", ">I told her maybe she should see a professional about this but she shuts me down and says it\u2019s just anxiety\n\nDang yall has anxiety gotten so normalized that people really think it's not something to go to therapy for??? ffs \n\nESH - she needs to get help. Whatever she's got going on sounds exhausting and debilitating and limiting not just for you, OP, but also for herself. \n\nMan you couldn't have taken her to a gas station or grocery store or something nearby?", "NTA. As a person with OCD, she most definitely has OCD. She really needs therapy and possibly medication.", "INFO: Is there not a store that sells ice cream besides an ice cream place?\n\nI'm going to go with NTA right now. 30 minutes is a long drive so you're reasoning makes sense. What really needs to happen is she needs get herself under control whatever issues she has or is dealing with. She needs to understand that her \"anxiety\" puts pressure on you.\n\nIt's her job to manage it. Not put the pressure on you.", "NTA", "NTA. You need to consider if being in a relationship with someone who refuses to get help for their mental health is something you want. Whether this is anxiety, OCD, or something else...it's something. \n\nAnd she should have just said she didn't feel comfortable with the frozen yogurt place and to skip dessert and go home. Demanding you drive 30 minutes to another place is acting like a child who was promised ice cream.", "NTA, all processed food comes from a machine like that. She is completely irrational and has severe mental health issues, I would get her professional help asap.", "I would say NTA although your wording could have been better. I have the feeling even if you had driven to the other place she wouldn\u2019t have been happy. I hope she gets help.", "NTA but this sounds way above Reddit's (and your) pay grade. This is somebody with a significant-sounding psychological difficulty which is affecting her life and the lives of people around her. She needs professional help.", "She needs therapy and help.", "NTA. Although if my partner was refusing to address something this serious, that would be the end of it for me. She needs help. Can you show her the medical definition? I\u2019m no doctor but it\u2019s pretty obvious from your description that OCD is the likely cause.", "NTA. Going 30min out of the way for ice cream is silly. Your GF needs professional help, which will likely include exposure therapy at some point. This is MUCH larger than just run of the mill anxiety", "NAH - your girlfriend really needs to seek help for her compulsions. You could have just taken her to get the ice cream she wanted but since it was half an hour away I see why you were frustrated. Either way, you need to learn to either and accept and be supportive when dealing with her compulsions, or break up with her, there is no in between.", "ESH\n\nYou for pushing the yogurt issue when you obviously know what your GF is like.\n\nYour GF for not seeking professional help when she clearly needs it. This is not just \"anxiety\" this is either ocd or an extreme phobia to germs.", "This is not the right relationship for her or you. Break up and move on.", "ESH\n\n  \n\n\nYour GF needs to seek treatment\n\n  \n\n\nYou need to communicate better", "If she preferred individual ice creams that are in wrappers, why couldn\u2019t you stop at a gas station? Was even a gas station 30 minutes away? \n\nRegardless, it sounds like she has anxiety that\u2019s displayed in OCD behaviors/tendencies. A therapist could provide her with coping skills, as well as other resources such as medication to lessen her anxiety. I understand how having a mental illness/diagnosis can be debilitating, but if you continue to feed into her diagnosis without her getting the correct help, you very well could be making it worse. Although she snaps at you and gets mad, I\u2019d still be recommending she seek outside help. \n\nNTA", "NTA. The Iranian yogurt isn't the problem here.", "ESH\n\nGF has refused professional help which she clearly needs, which makes her a bit of an AH. If she is like this, she needs better communication, and should have said that she wanted something sealed. OP can't be expected to know everything after only 8 months. \n\nAs for OP, he could have been more gentle and not snapped, but I can understand why he snapped, everyone has a limit, and while he probably can manage with Gfs OCD, she's not exactly helping by refusing professional help", "NTA\n\nshe has a disability and you can't be expected to accommodate it. You should break up though, as she is not seeking help and it will only get worse", "NTA She has anxiety and obsessive-compulsive, intrusive  thoughts and other issues that seriously reduce her quality of life. Focus not on the minuti\u00e6 of her actions, but on her mental health. She needs medical help NOW, that's NOW. Her discomfort as you describe it is painful to hear.", "NTA.  I'm sure you're aware by now that any serious relationship with her will be a great great deal of work..", "NTA... and, to be frank, are you sure about this? Do you see yourself dealing with this sort of insane behaviour all your life? Dude, just extricate yourself from this situation.", "NTA for not driving a long way.  Your GF has more than anxiety.  She needs professional help managing it.", "NTA. Your GF has a significant and untreated mental illness. She refuses to see that and is letting it impact your life and her life continually. She needs proper diagnosis and treatment, not being enabled to continually bury her head in the sand.", "ESH. She needs help. You aren\u2019t it.", "She definitely needs mental health help. I am in agreement that you shouldn't drive another 30 minutes unless she is offering gas money because catering to this behavior doesn't help.\n\nWhat I don't agree with was the \"eat it or nothing\" stance.  You could have offered to take her to the supermarket nearby. You are not her parent.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nI was with you for a bit until the \u201cGet the frozen yogurt or nothing at all\u201d. Wtf? You\u2019re not her parent. If that was my girlfriend I would\u2019ve taken her to a grocery store nearby instead and got her some ice cream. You obviously know about her anxiety and her obvious mental health issues and proceeded to be a completely AH.", "Your girlfriend is clearly suffering from severe undiagnosed mental illness.\n\nI guess regarding the froyo YTA but overall she needs serious help not judgment.", "ESH you a little more for being straight up rude.\n\nBoth of you could have avoided dessert completely anyway. No yogurt, no icecream would have been simpler.\n\nYou're wasting time waiting for her to take care of herself, and it's her responsibility to overcome this and shouldn't need your support and reassurance for something that obviously you're not equipped to handle. OCD is not something that can simply be managed in a way that the other partner keeps on adjusting in every scenario. Nobody should be put in such a situation, they have to deal with their personal issues.", "Did you really say \"she could get the frozen yogurt or get nothing at all?\" Yikes. YTA.", "Yta are you her father and shes 12?\n\nYou can have frozen yogurt or nothing at all\n\nWow", "NTA however if you choose to stay with her knowing that these problems are going to only become more apparent as time goes on, and not push her to seek help YWBTA. She has a serious mental condition impacting her day to day life to the point she cant drive safely on her own, that is something more than anxiety.", "NTA. She needs professional help, and you need to consider if you want to stay with her if she continues to refuse getting help.", "What is with the calling your mom?", "NTA- you\u2019re describing a life with someone who has serious mental health issues (not mild) and that she can\u2019t control and is refusing treatment for.  It won\u2019t just get better.  You need to decide if you really want this type of life.", "NTA, she HAVE to eat the frozen yogurt. \n\nShe needs to seek professional help as her compulsions are not small things and she\u2019s not managing them well from the sounds of things", "She needs help. From a professional. This won\u2019t get any better OP. It will only get worse. You could\u2019ve been nicer in the moment but wanting her to get help is not a bad thing.", "NTA-but dude\u2026you already know she needs help here, why did you make it a big deal?", "Must be hell inside her head. She is far past due for the psychiatric intervention that she so desperately needs. Love to you both. Best wishes", "Obviously, I have compassion for your girlfriend. It sounds like her condition causes her to really struggle with even normal daily tasks. That said, the burden is not on you to manage her anxiety and to make room for her compulsions. She should at least hypothetically be interested in shifting some of these disruptive habits. If she isn't, honestly, you should probably not be with her, unless of course you don't mind putting up with all that stuff. But it seems like you do mind and it is leading to conflict. If she's not willing to seek help or try to change, that's not your fault. Your reaction was a bit harsh, perhaps, but I can totally understand being impatient with someone like this. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHonestly as someone with diagnosed OCD, this makes me really sad because I completely understand where she is coming from. I used to feel like this before I got help and started taking the proper medication.\n\nI can assure you these compulsions are hurting her a lot. It is an awful thing to live through. You should insist on getting her help. She thinks it may be anxiety so you may convince her to go to a professional just to help with this and then they can explain to her what the problem really is.\n\nYou are also a champ for staying with her through this btw. My bf also had to go through this with me and I admire his patience and dedication.

I dont think you\u2019re TA for being frustrated or even not wanting to go. Where you are softly TA is not just getting the ice cream. You know she isn\u2019t going to change or get help so you\u2019ll have to live like this to be with her. Sadly I\u2019m not kidding. I would not think you\u2019re TA if you choose to leave. Her life will be very very complicated and filled with panic and anxiety bc she refuses to get therapy to handle her problems. I do think she is fully TA bc she won\u2019t do anything to help herself when she very clearly has issues. Also have her read about restaurant bathrooms and take a Lysol wipe with her next time she decides it\u2019s a good spot to clean her dishes. Like have her wipe a stall wall. There are no toilet lids and the spray goes up and out no matter what anyone says. Her dishes are much more nasty after the bathroom than they were before unless you have one of the BEST staffed restaurants to ever exist.", "YTA, it has nothing to do with ice cream dude, it has everything to do with you being a jerk for no reason.

Im (25M) and she\u2019s (24F).\n\nMy girlfriend is lovely, but I think she has some sort of undiagnosed OCD or something. She is always frantically running around cleaning things, any spill or anything out of place she rushes to fix it. I don\u2019t let her drive anymore because whenever we drive she has to turn around to make sure she didn\u2019t hit a car or something. She washes her hands multiple times a day until she is sure she can\u2019t see a single spot on it.  Whenever we go out to eat she brings her own hand soap and washes her utensils and plates in the bathroom and is constantly picking at her food. She also counts all the way to 100 multiple times in a row. I told her maybe she should see a professional about this but she shuts me down and says it\u2019s just anxiety, so I just stopped bringing it up.\n\nYesterday, me and her went out for the first time in a while. Like I mentioned before I know how she is with germs and stuff so we usually don\u2019t go out because she is always so anxious. I decided that I would take her to the park and just spend some time together.\n\nWe get to the park and we actually had a great time. She had a few compulsions but they were pretty manageable. Although we had to go to the bathroom every single time she touched anything. \n\nAfter the park I told her we would stop for some dessert. I asked her if she had any suggestions and she said she wanted something cold, so I pulled up to Sweet Frog. We went inside and when she saw the dispensers for the frozen yogurt she immediately looked very anxious. She then said she couldn\u2019t eat it. I asked why and she told me that she would\u2019ve preferred ice cream because they are in wrappers and she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s inside the dispenser. I told her we already drove all the way here and the dispensers were clean and she didn\u2019t have to worry but she just said the same thing but more frantically. I could tell she was about to cry so I told her she could get the frozen yogurt or get nothing at all. She ended up getting the frozen yogurt but she didn\u2019t eat it. As soon as we got back in the car she started crying and telling me that I was so inconsiderate and it\u2019s not much to just drive to another ice cream place. I told her that unless she gave me gas money then I couldn\u2019t drive to the ice cream place which is like 30 minutes away from the sweet frog. She went quiet and she didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the drive. When we got home she immediately shut herself in the bathroom for like 20 minutes and then she went in our room to take a nap. This morning she didn\u2019t even say bye to me when I left for work.\n\nI just think this whole situation is ridiculous. I called my mom and told her the situation and she said that I was TA most definitely. I don\u2019t really think I am as I wasn\u2019t trying to waste gas driving 30 minutes just for ice cream.

You seem able to endure rituals and roll with what she needs environmentally in order to feel safe. \n\nShe definitely has OCD, which, by the way, *is an anxiety disorder*. She does the compulsive behaviors to try and quiet the anxiety (obsessions), but it's only a temporary fix, and it's certainly no way to live the rest of one's life. OCD flares in moments of acute, seemingly-unrelated anxiety (for example, when I was trying to get pregnant and it wasn't working, I would do a lot of checking behaviors). \n\nI am going to say she's NTA either because these behaviors are likely things she's done her whole life, and you suggesting she get help must feel overwhelmingly scary, like someone is going to take her security blanket away. \n\nOften loved ones bring up getting help during a conflict moment and it feels more like an accusation in a mean-spirited way, even if that's not the intent. It can be scary to bring up a hard thing in a good moment because you don't want to ruin it, but that's when it's most likely to be received well. If you're able to bring up OCD again in a calm, safe moment (like in her home when the two of you have been enjoying yourselves) and ask if she's ever thought about seeing a therapist and psychiatrist to help with this, and she still deflects or becomes defensive, then you need to be able to say how her behavior impacts you.

She absolutely does need help, which he's mentioned to her before and gotten shut down, and she wasn't specific in her request and if it had never been an issue before he had no way of knowing. It also isn't her fault that she's sick, likely with either OCD or OCPD, but it doesn't negate her reactions to others when she's stressed and triggered. They are not responsible for following her compulsions, especially if not specified beforehand.\n\nOP, if you read this, the reality is she is not likely to acknowledge her issues and seek help until she hits a personal rock bottom. For me that moment was slightly traumatic, but it gave me the push I needed and I've been seeking help since. Am I cured? No. But I have coping strategies and in the day-to-day it is barely an issue anymore. But that's because I got help for the underlying issue, which is that it IS an anxiety disorder, and these compulsions are a way for her to control the fact that her brain is playing on a loop, 24/7/365, different horrifying and traumatic episodes that she cannot stop. I used to think I just watched too much L&O: SVU or some shit. It's also a bit of a stereotype that people who have OCD/OCPD are aware that their compulsions are directly linked to these anxieties. I thought it was a coincidence that I constantly was picturing coming home to loved ones dismembered and murdered and that I also needed to have everything color matching to an insane degree based on a predictable cycle. The bottom line is you don't know what the clinching issue is going to be for her to seek help, you just have to decide whether or not it's going to benefit yourself to stay with her until she does. I would sit her down (when she feels like talking) and ask for some clarification and guidelines about food or other containers so that this doesn't happen again, and that you didn't mean to upset her, but the miscommunication and expecting you to just be clairvoyant about her needs regarding her compulsions is becoming an issue. It's possible this kind of conversation won't end well. She's probably also defensive about the whole thing and is aware it isn't rational but she physically cannot stop. It's akin to an addiction in that way.\n\nOP, I truly hope that whatever makes your girlfriend seek help does not end up being as traumatic for her as it was for me.

If he's CHOOSING to stay in this relationship, he needs to focus on how to get her actual help, not bully her into not having a condition.\n\nHer response here was clearly one he hadn't thought of, but it's absolutely predictable for someone with OCD and germophobia. \"Just get over it\" has helped precisely zero folks in that state, ever.", "Yes, it can be difficult to seek help, but she's still responsible for her life and all that implies. The problem I've seen is that folks who need help often don't realize the severity of their illness. They've wanted to feel \"normal\" for so long that they've continually excused their own behavior in attempts to reassure themselves that they're ok. Typically they get along well enough (in their mind) that they feel seeking help would a. stigmatize them and b. make things too real.\n\nI don't mean to stereotype as this is just my experience.

I hope that you're on the road to a better life for yourself.", "it sounds like you\u2019ve gone to professionals and maybe not been diagnosed correctly, whereas she\u2019s self diagnosed and decided she doesn\u2019t need help.

Some commercial factories are pretty gross. Also, with the entire manufacturing process, transport, storage, and everything other factor in mind, you also absolutely cannot guarantee that prepackaged ice cream is at all cleaner than self serve froyo.", "Nope.

Manufacturing environments can be absolutely horrifying without regular audits and quality control.", "But how clean are the nozzles *on the cow*?", "To be fair though, it sounds like OP constantly has to go out of his way and compromise a lot, and him snapping after months of this situation in this relatively mild way is completely understandable.", "Oh yes, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s totally exhausting for him. But they both need to discuss the issue respectfully. She\u2019s not at all rational regarding her anxiety/OCD so he needs to understand that logic isn\u2019t going to fix her issues. She needs professional help.", "Lol you put in the work with someone like this and then come back here with your awards. Dude sounds like a saint to me.", "So then why not break up with her? Why is he staying in a relationship where treating his partner like a child feels reasonable?", "Gross! And yes, the self service model for food gives me the ick.

Telling someone no now is bullying?", "What's the \"right\" response?\n\n\"Yes, I'll pay for fuel and use my time to drive you to something that's another 30 minutes away. When we get home, I'll wait quietly for you to finish counting to 100 so you don't lose count. Then I'll take you out to dinner and instead of sitting together, you can go wash your cutlery in the bathroom. Tomorrow we can go to the park, I'll make sure we're never far from a bathroom so you can wash your hands every 30 seconds.\"\n\nThere's a point where it becomes unreasonable and OP becomes the victim of his GF's OCD.

You can get \"ice cream in a wrapper\" from gas stations, convenience stores, grocery stores etc. There was no need to drive the 30 min to another ice cream place.
