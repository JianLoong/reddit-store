Her husband (32) works full time, and as far as the tax man knows, she\u2019s a SAHM. Except she has a full set up business running out of her house, doing beauty treatments on people. She has a socmed business page, a website and everything, and takes organised bookings. She charges market rates (sometimes more) for her services, and asks outright for cash in hand. \n\nI dont normally go to her, but on this occasion I decided to book in just because my regular beauty therapist was unavailable. I don\u2019t carry cash, so I asked her if it was ok if I used bank transfer. She said it was fine but label the transfer as \u2018lunch\u2019. \n\nWhen I asked her a bit more about why, she said it was so she didn\u2019t have to pay tax on her earnings. Per my partner, it\u2019s generally well known that she doesn\u2019t. She stashes the cash and they only pay tax on his income. \n\nI feel like this is pretty crappy. We all ought to pay our share of taxes. Things like health care (NHS), public education, parks and things like that depend on our taxes. She accesses these things like the rest of us, so shouldn\u2019t she be contributing? \n\nBut I also know that major corps get tax breaks and billionaires are dodging the tax office as much as they can too, so I\u2019m kinda torn on this one. Is it really that big a deal if she\u2019s not paying her 20k a year?  \n\nWIBTA if I reported her so that she has to formalise her business and start paying tax?\n\nETA: I say side hustle, but she\u2019s absolutely working a full time job from home. I don\u2019t know how much she earns, but a middle income earner in the UK pays anywhere from \u00a310k to \u00a350k in tax depending on income. Just wanted to clarify that since I wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nEdit 2: The evasion gets up my nose because she basically has a full time business set up out of her house. She advertises, organises bookings with the general public, does an array of treatments from lash tint and wax to facials and body scrubs etc. it\u2019s like a mini day spa. \n\nin saying that, the judgement seems pretty split down the middle, but someone left a comment that said I\u2019d technically be correct to report her but still would be a major asshole. And given that this is the AITA sub I accept that judgement. I won\u2019t report her, and I\u2019ll leave any discussion about the tax stuff to my partner.

In the case that you are correct and she\u2019s found to be guilty of tax evasion, you\u2019d most likely meet the exact same fate as you would, given she was not guilty.

She is taking, without giving anything else in return. That is highly unethical and you would absolutely NOT be the asshole if you reported it.", "Yes, she should not be committing tax fraud and NTA/YWNBTA for this. Be aware that reporting her would involve either filing a police report with your local station, or calling the Action Fraud line.  Do not tell her that you have done this, as that could be considered tipping-off and you could potentially then face legal charges yourself.\n\nFor the record, some of the ways some large companies manage to avoid taxes are frustrating quirks of having an international system, like excessive franchising fees to decrease profits (Starbucks), but for the majority of people who \"don't pay tax\" its actually because they don't have income to tax. Some are doing dodgy things like taking loans out on their shareholding instead of liquidating the shares, and that is also not right, but the majority of what you hear isn't actually unfair like it sounds.

If you care enough to consider literally reporting her to the government you should be more than up to confronting her and sharing your feelings. \n\nIf that\u2019s too awkward for you and you can\u2019t work up the courage then I don\u2019t think this is really as much about justice if you want to believe it is.", "I\u2019d be more concerned that she\u2019s doing beauty treatments without a license in a facility that isn\u2019t subject to health inspections. I don\u2019t know what the laws in the UK say about that, tho.", "YTA.  You were seriously considering throwing your partner's sister under the bus?  Oh, yeah, that can only be good for family relations.  Your partner should dump you just for thinking it.", "You suck.  Mind your own business.", "You must be a fun person", "Are you serious? She should report family anonymously like a coward? What would she gain from this? Whatever amount of taxes this woman isn\u2019t paying would not solve world hunger.", "Yeah this is the bit that bothers me, she won't be insured because even if she has indemnity insurance technically, it absolutely won't pay out to anyone because they won't cover someone who is working illegally. Also depending on what she is doing, does she have the requisite qualifications and licenses for procedures she is doing?", "Absolutely. Fuck the feds", "Yes", "Oooh I could be a tax inspector", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I would report her, not just the tax authority, because people skirting tax laws hurt everyone, but here in my state we have a state licensure board for cosmetologists, and if they violate their rules the stylist or whatever can lose their license to practice professionally. I would report her to them too. NTA.", "NTA. It's really funny that so many people are totally okay with theft, if it's just the theft of an entrepreneur against society. Lol, no wonder everything is fucked up.", "The rest of the country is on its knees. The whole of the public sector. Cost of living crisis too.   Its in a state and people sat there not paying tax. Its a joke. Bet the same person will happily blame people arriving on a boat.  Call HMRC. Or DM me", "YWBTA. Mind your own business. You shouldn't snitch on people who aren't hurting others. Not to mention, a lot of your taxpayer money gets eaten up by bureaucracy rather than actually helping people. Also, do you really want to have a bad relationship with your husband's family?", "I don't know what it's like where you are, but where I am the fees would hurt but the killer would be not having a business anymore. The cost of licensing and having an actual space for business is the prohibitive bit. The only reason to dodge taxes is to keep the illicit business under the radar in general. \n\nShe's not running a drug ring, or laundering money, she's supporting her family during a difficult time. If she's got clients, she's offering a service. Maybe it's as costly as at a real salon, but being local she's keeping money in the community and she's more convenient.\n\nMoreover, it's such a *small* business. Where I am, big businesses and rich folks not paying anywhere near enough taxes is the real drain on the economy. Not small business people working out of their kitchens to make ends meet.\n\nI would leave this one alone.", "YWBTA.\n\nIt doesn't affect you so mind your business. This is your partner's sister we're talking about; are you really willing to risk your relationship with your partner and his family over something you can just turn a blind eye towards?\n\nShould she be paying taxes? Sure, but that's the government's issue to solve - you're not gonna get some \"finder's fee\" for snitching.", "They will get her eventually.", "Snitching on future family member.\nAuch.\n\nYwbta", "YWBTA.\n\nBet your fun at family party's.", "Taxation is theft and snitches get what they deserve. YTA. Mind your own business.", "NTA - I pay mine, she can pay hers.", "YTA. Stop licking Uncle Sam\u2019s boots.", "YTA. Mind your own business. You're willing to screw your partners family life up because you have a moral conscious to a government that rips everybody off daily. \n\nTake a walk to any industrial area, half the workers are getting paid under the table. But you would rather attack your partners sister. \n\nIf I was your partner, this would be a deal breaker..", "Is she keeping considerable cash at home? That\u2019s how one gets robbed and even killed", "Yeah. I'd say NTA for wanting to report, but maybe it's not the best thing to do.", "She\u2019ll get caught eventually.", "I just want to point out that tax evasion affects a whole comunity, so technicly she is harming people", "People not paying their taxes do hurt everyone though.", "The real problem is that if she isn\u2019t a VAT registered company then that means she doesn\u2019t have business insurance or liability cover. She can\u2019t; she need to be registered.\n\nSo minus the paying tax argument, she is in the shit if any of her clients suffer damage from her treatments.\n\nThis is a bigger problem than tax dodging, in my opinion.", "I agree OP is in the UK which means she can\u2019t be insured for any of these treatments and also that the couple are (likely) using free healthcare, free healthcare, depending on the husbands declared income probably childcare hours. I don\u2019t really mind people skimming a bit because life is hard but running a full business is taking the piss.", "To be fair, let's generously say her cut of tax is 30k a year. Divide that by the population of the country. That's how much she's in a sense 'stealing' from each person. It would be a tiny part of a penny. \n\nI'm not saying it's right and I know that way of thinking isn't completely correct. I just don't think it's her business to go report family. The tax man will catch up eventually if she keeps this up.", "God save the king, he needs his pounds.", "I'd absolutely report my family for it too. Tax Fraud is theft, and this is 100% tax fraud.", "Also, if she's not paying tax, then does her business have a licence? Is she insured for product and professional liability? What happens if a client wants to sue her for a mistake/an injury?\n\nHeck, if she's willing to cut corners on one area of her professional life, then where can you actually be sure she's acting safely in line with industry safety/hygiene standards? \n\nThere's a hell of a lot of knock-on problems that come from running an illegal business!", "but why should my taxes pay for her to shit out kids. who pays when she fucks up with a client, again the rest of us!! sorry in the US there is more personal liability because of the health system. the NHS fixes everyone up and therefore we need to contribute.", "^^^^^this", "You could say the same about people on benefits tho? They don\u2019t pay tax and still get to access those services, should people who pay more tax get special treatment because they\u2019ve paid more? Someone doing eyelashes, cash in hand isn\u2019t increasing tax for everyone else", "I'd argue billionaires and billionaire companies exploiting loopholes to evade paying taxes is *infinitely* more damaging than someone running a beauty shop out of their basement", "Except the reality is more of that tax revenue goes towards funding public services than it does to paying for the royal family - it\u2019s 1p a person a day\u2026so \u00a33.65 per person a year.", "Considering that the government steals from us to give it to rich people? Yeah. Like in an ideal world where taxation was handled fairly and the government wasn't up to its gills in corruption I'd say tax fraud is an inexcusable dereliction of your duty as a member of society but in the world we actually live in where rich people weasel their way out of the bulk of their taxes by exploiting loopholes they manipulated the government into creating I say fuck it.", "Hell yeah.", "they arent stealing from the government, they are preventing the government from stealing from them, how does the boot taste all the way down your throat", "What kinda response were you expecting I wonder", "Taxation is stealing if you think about it.", "I dont think she will be insured. my friend was recently hurt after going to a lash tech that was a similar set up. huge instagram following so she assumed the women was legit, after the allergic reaction it\u2019s transpired that the woman is uninsured, her companies house record is a shell and she\u2019s refused to even refund my friend!!", "You hit the nail on the head; if she\u2019s not a registered business then she can\u2019t have business insurance or liability. If one of her customers suffers damage from her treatments then it\u2019s all on fire.", "The people on benefits are usually on benefits for a reason , either cannot find a job yet, cannot work due to a disability etc , ( yes I am aware there are some that milk the system but not half as many as those that cheat the tax system ) the idea is that once those that can find work and work do then they will pay into the system that has supported them , this woman is using a system that she has no intention of helping to pay into . It\u2019s morally and legally wrong . And yes we are all finding it difficult at the moment and there is a difference between someone doing a little side gig to bring a bit of extra money in and someone doing what is pretty much a career and not paying any tax at all . It also does speak as to what else she may be doing to circumvent other tax and legal rules .", "Not wrong but not the point you were making, if we start pulling other examples to stretch our debate the point will become mute.", "The UK doesn't have \"feds\"", "Taxation is what funds the everything. No taxes means no roads, no postal service, no police, no enforceable rules except by warlords. Yeah man, I'm good with paying taxes and not living in Somalia.", "Yeah you just have royals stealing from you instead", "I'm not angry. It's just a shame, for society in general, that people think the way you do.\nI don't fiddle my taxes, nor to the best of my knowledge do people I know. Everyone I know who runs their own business is vat registered etc and declare their income by submitting their accounts etc. \n\nYou're absolutely right that big companies are creative (or worse) in reducing their tax burden. That's wrong, and it should be stopped, it doesn't legitimise beckys nail bar fiddling her taxes though. \n\nHow are public services going to be funded if nobody pays in?\n\nOr if like you claim that almost everyone is on the fiddle... Imagine how good services could be if all paid their fair share?"]}
