Her husband (32) works full time, and as far as the tax man knows, she\u2019s a SAHM. Except she has a full set up business running out of her house, doing beauty treatments on people. She has a socmed business page, a website and everything, and takes organised bookings. She charges market rates (sometimes more) for her services, and asks outright for cash in hand. \n\nI dont normally go to her, but on this occasion I decided to book in just because my regular beauty therapist was unavailable. I don\u2019t carry cash, so I asked her if it was ok if I used bank transfer. She said it was fine but label the transfer as \u2018lunch\u2019. \n\nWhen I asked her a bit more about why, she said it was so she didn\u2019t have to pay tax on her earnings. Per my partner, it\u2019s generally well known that she doesn\u2019t. She stashes the cash and they only pay tax on his income. \n\nI feel like this is pretty crappy. We all ought to pay our share of taxes. Things like health care (NHS), public education, parks and things like that depend on our taxes.

I don\u2019t know how much she earns, but a middle income earner in the UK pays anywhere from \u00a310k to \u00a350k in tax depending on income. Just wanted to clarify that since I wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nEdit 2: The evasion gets up my nose because she basically has a full time business set up out of her house. She advertises, organises bookings with the general public, does an array of treatments from lash tint and wax to facials and body scrubs etc. it\u2019s like a mini day spa. \n\nin saying that, the judgement seems pretty split down the middle, but someone left a comment that said I\u2019d technically be correct to report her but still would be a major asshole. And given that this is the AITA sub I accept that judgement. I won\u2019t report her, and I\u2019ll leave any discussion about the tax stuff to my partner.

In the case that you are correct and she\u2019s found to be guilty of tax evasion, you\u2019d most likely meet the exact same fate as you would, given she was not guilty.

She is taking, without giving anything else in return. That is highly unethical and you would absolutely NOT be the asshole if you reported it.", "Yes, she should not be committing tax fraud and NTA/YWNBTA for this. Be aware that reporting her would involve either filing a police report with your local station, or calling the Action Fraud line.  Do not tell her that you have done this, as that could be considered tipping-off and you could potentially then face legal charges yourself.\n\nFor the record, some of the ways some large companies manage to avoid taxes are frustrating quirks of having an international system, like excessive franchising fees to decrease profits (Starbucks), but for the majority of people who \"don't pay tax\" its actually because they don't have income to tax. Some are doing dodgy things like taking loans out on their shareholding instead of liquidating the shares, and that is also not right, but the majority of what you hear isn't actually unfair like it sounds.
