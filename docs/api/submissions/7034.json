Sexualising her? Staring her?\n\nNot only is it unnecessary to censor the word, the censoring makes it hard to understand.", "For some reason I assumed slut shaming. Censoring the word \"sexualizing\" is actually even more stupid.", "Which is really weird, since you seem to have jumped on actual tends (like using S*ing) and held on rather tightly. \n\nProper communication isn't a trend.", "Yes and also ask for the shower  chair op. Wouldn't  hurt to have it. Nta. \nI am almost 40 and don't  lock the bathroom  door when I shower,  neither do my parents at 65 and 62. We all r3spect each other and knock if it's  unclear  who is using  the bathroom  and for what ( sometimes  I want to wash my hands and my father shaves  )", "NTA\n\nI have an epileptic sibling.  They never showered without someone else present in the house, nor locked the bathroom door to shower, and often propped it open just an inch or so (with something that would give easily if someone *needed* to enter) to be 100% sure we could hear if something was amiss.  Nobody could see anything, everyone knew to knock or speak.  It was never a problem.  And, again, this door wasn't even always fully closed.\n\nYour 5 year old brother can learn to knock on closed doors.  Adults should already know, and it is *not* your fault if some idiot or asshole doesn't do it.", "NTA at all but what kind of lock is it? If your parents are so concerned then they should have a lock on the door that they are able to unlock from the outside.  Obviously a sliding bolt is no good but a keyed lock with one key in the bathroom and one kept safe would work or a plain old privacy latch that can be undone using a screwdriver or similar flat edge instrument would surely cover any fears they have of walking in on you accidentally. Embarrassment doesn't tend to kill but not getting to you in a timely manner after a slip in the tub could be very serious indeed.", "NTA. I just wanted to ask if you\u2019re getting support for your fibro? I\u2019m 19, and got diagnosed within the last 2 years with it as well, despite likely having it since birth. Reddit also has a support group, r/fibromyalgia that might be a good idea to check out.", "NTA, f ur parents", "Nta. I had a friend in high school who drowned when showering.  She had the flu,  got dizzy, hit her head,  fell unconscious, and drowned.  Her mom heard the fall, couldn't get in because the door was locked, and by the time they got the door open it was too late. Rule in my house is no locking the bathroom door when showering  and all closed doors must be respected.", "NTA. this is really bizarre. my parents had a rule that the bathroom door couldn\u2019t be locked in case anyone were to fall in the shower.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m honestly lost as to what possible reason your parents could have for not understanding you are much safer not locking the door. Everyone can hear the shower running, nobody\u2019s going to accidentally walk in on you. \n\nI have Ehlers-Danlos, which causes a whole host of problems leading to a similar fear of falling and hurting myself in the shower. My parents never had a problem with it-if they heard me drop anything in there they would yell to see if I\u2019m alright-and it seriously wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nSide note: have you thought about a shower chair? I know, I know\u2026I put off getting one for a long time but once I did, I realized I should have gotten it years ago. It makes showering *so much easier* when you have chronic pain/illness.", "I was going to suggest the same thing! Shower chair changed my life!", "I would like that to make sense but its the parents who are the ones suggesting it. I dont get it, is one of the parents a werewolf who when a shower is on causes them to stop being human?", "Since I was 4, which is very unusual. So much so it was misdiagnosed for 30+ years. Gradually increasing symptoms were associated with other conditions for YEARS, so I officially diagnosed in January 2022 a solid 12 years after passing out for the first time, 19 years after being told I shouldn't donate blood again because I was such a problematic donor, 28 years after being put in remedial PE for \"balance issues\", 31 years after being diagnosed with tachycardia.", "Is the word \"sexualizing\"?  That word is not just some reddit trend if so.", "Oh wow that is highly unusual. I can't imagine what going through all that misdiagnosed felt like though. I'm glad you have you proper diagnosis now though. I've never heard fo anyone having it before puberty! Learns something new every day.", "I think it's sexual assault, it's often short handed to SA so to further censor it.... ridiculous", "NTA. You ha e \u00e0 very valid reason not to lock the door and your parents shouldn't want you to lock it.\nThey can just knock on the door if they want to know if someone is in the bathroom like any other person would do.", "NTA. As a parent I would be relieved you took your condition seriously enough to keep the door unlocked. What is their deal?", "NTA. Our bathroom door is never locked (it has a key lock, but we don't use the key). A person locks the door to the bathroom if THEY want more privacy, not if other people tell them they should lock it. And in your case, for safety reasons, you should not be locking it.", "NTA. I don't even have a medical condition like yours, and still shower with the door unlocked just in case I fall. Have since I was around the same age as you, too. Your parents are likely freaking out about your impending puberty, and it's coming out in some weird ways. Good luck making them see reason.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm really confused. If the door is closed and it's your family all there, why is it inappropriate to leave the door unlocked. It's so odd. \n\nAlso, how do they know it is unlocked when you shower? Are they over there testing it when you go in or something? It's so bizarre. And the part about it inviting people in....makes no sense. I say this as a woman in her thirties who lived in a family who had showered in the family home without locking the door. \n\nYou reasoning (though you don't even need one) makes a lot of sense. My parents had a no doors are locked at night rule back when I lived at home in case their was a fire or something else where they had to get to us quickly. \n\nThey make it seem almost like a sexual invitation to just shower with a door unlocked. It's beyond bizarre.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk your parents to buy a privacy lock. We have  ... on the bathroom doors ... these locks you can close from the inside, but you can open them from the outside by using a quarter coin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis gives you privacy ... nobody accidentially opens the door - and safety ... if you need to open the door, it can be done fast. Pretty neat when the kids are smaller, and very likely also helpful in your case.", "Mom knows Dad is a perv.", "i wish my bathroom door had a lock \ud83d\udc80", "This is EXTREMELY weird on your parents' part. Nta. You aren't doing anything wrong. If anything, you're being VERY mature and responsible for your age and thinking logically", "NTA. nobody, even a 5 year old, should be going into the bathroom if the door is closed. Not without knocking first. It's strange anybody is even aware you aren't locking the door, unless somebody stupidly walked in on you and instead of feeling bad they decided to blame you?", "Nta but a good solution is to take baths more often.", "NTA. No one in my family locks the door while they shower. We all know if the door is shut or we hear the shower, we either 1. Knock before we come in or 2. Wait til the person is done. Your parents and brother are capable of understanding this concept.", "Are your parents very religious or otherwise extremely uptight when it comes to nudity and sexuality? Because their reaction doesn\u2019t make any sense. NTA", "even after reading the replies to your comment, I still don't know what the word is that \"shouldn't be pronounced\". What were you trying to say here?", "A 5 year old? What awkward situation? NTA", "It's crazy. I have an older sister and - first of all - I could hear if the shower was running before walking into the bathroom. And second of all, if I somehow missed it, the awkward situation goes as far as \"Oh, sorry, I didn't hear the shower, my bad.\"\n\nIs there no shower curtain?", "Right here. This is the answer. It throws back in their faces their own bizarre thought process.", "I also have an underlying genetic condition that makes people with it more prone to a number of comorbid conditions, including POTS. I was diagnosed very young with it (also unusual, takes 10-20 years for most diagnoses), but people knew way less in 1989. There is a pediatric program for POTS in Baltimore now, so doctors are more aware now."]}
