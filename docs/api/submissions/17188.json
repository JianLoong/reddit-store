My partner (35m) was off all day and literally did nothing all day. As I walk in I realize the apt is a mess. I say hello and change my clothes. After changing I start picking up the apt, cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and I shower. When I get done my partner asked me \u201cwhat are you cooking me for dinner bitch\u201d? I paused for a bit. One- I was taken back by the bitch comment, 2- I was getting pissed. He had been home all day doing nothing and instead of coming home to a clean apt or having a meal cooked for us already he\u2019s asked that. So me being the witty person I am I said \u201cwhat do you want\u201d? He replied \u201cI don\u2019t know, anything you want\u201d. I said ok and grab a note pad and pen and wrote a few notes down. He asked \u201cwhat are you doing\u201d. I told him I was writing a list of things I need to pick up for dinner tonight and that I\u2019m going to make something special. I went to the store and came back shortly. After about 10 mins of bullshitting in the kitchen I got a pan, took the notes I wrote down, and put them in the pan. I got a spatula and moved the notes around in the pan and even put salt and pepper in the pan. After about 5 mins of doing that, I took the pan off the stove and presented my meal to him. He looked in the pan and said \u201cwhat tf is this\u201d? I told him it was his dinner and he should read what I cooked for him. The notes said \u201cbeen home all day and can\u2019t cook a meal\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d, and \u201canything you want\u201d. He looked at me puzzled and now hasn\u2019t  spoken to me in a week. I haven\u2019t tried to talk to him either since this has really pissed me off and rubbed me the wrong way.
