This is a huge part of your life, just like the case would be if you had previously been married and not told your fianc\u00e8. If the truth came out from someone else, your fianc\u00e8 would lose trust in you and also doubt himself as to why he wasn't good enough to know this information. Additionally- losing a child can create issues surrounding whether the grieving parent wants to have any future kids or not. You and your fianc\u00e8 need to be on the same page regarding wanting kids. If you have any doubts about having kids in the future, then your fianc\u00e8 should know in case this is a deal breaker for him, and also so he doesn't blame himself.\n\nI'd recommend you seek therapy for your grief, and to guide you through the honesty process.

I also strongly feel you do not need to tell anyone anything if you don\u2019t want to/aren\u2019t ready. This is YOUR journey. You do what is right for YOU.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss", "Thanks for adding this.", "OP\u2019s ex also witnessed their son\u2019s accident. Doesn\u2019t that make him just as guilty of neglect as the OP? Isn\u2019t he just as negligent as her? Yet he blames her completely", "At the same point, toddlers are quick and this is something  that can happen all too fast. In the end, no one wants their child to be in an accident. Parents mess up a lot, but most don't have severely consequences. Some people are very unlucky, however", "Everyone deserves to enter a marriage with their eyes wide open about who they are marrying. If OP was completely healed from their trauma then this might be different conversation (but then she also wouldn't have any problem talking about it). But, she isn't. Her trauma obviously still affects her (no judgement, I can't imagine losing my child, and there's no \"one way\" or \"specific timeline\" to grieve). And if it still affects her, then it *will* affect their relationship at some point, *especially if they decide to have kids*. It's incredibly naive to believe that that won't be a trigger for her, affect her mental health during pregnancy and postpartum, which will absolutely have a flow on affect to her partner, and potentially their (currently theoretical) baby. \n\nSo, whilst I agree that opening up to her partner about her past trauma is absolutely her choice (and the sister was an AH with how she went about that conversation), the fiance deserves the chance to make his own informed decision about the marriage. By not telling him beforehand, OP would be robbing him of *his* choice regarding their future. It's not to say that he would leave her, but if she doesn't tell him, they have a kid, and she has a mental breakdown due to a combo of her trauma triggers, postpartum overwhelm/depression/psychosis, you can betcha that he'll go through the \"I didn't sign up for this\" thought process - and he'd be right. \n\nIf they weren't getting married (and were childfree) then this would be a different conversation, but with marriage on the table this changes things. Keeping this from her fiance would be comparable to hiding significant financial debt: maybe she could keep on top of it and it won't affect their relationship, but it is FAR more likely that it will come up at some point and potentially break them up down the road.\n\nSo, whilst I respect and appreciate your views in regards to her healing and autonomy, context matters.\n\nEdit: typos", "It's not about helping her. It's about that the fact that trauma informs, influences, and drives behaviors, usually behaviors that are both out of character and hugely (negatively) impactful to their loved ones. \n\nKnowing that it's a trauma response - being able to see what kind of situations might provoke a trauma response - can help both people in the relationship to be kind to themselves and the other person. Deliberately hiding your trauma and just hoping it never comes out and hurts anyone you love often ends up being an act of unintentional cruelty.", "OP's sister was potentially in the wrong for what she said. I say potentially because OP has not disclosed what happened to the baby. However, OP absolutely should be having this discussion with her future spouse before they get married. This is beyond Reddit as the top commenter pointed out.\n\nEdit: I saw further down OP disclosed what happen to her child. Her sister is unequivocally an AH. The rest of my comment stands.", "i'm so sorry you've felt some kind of pain like this. it helps to open up and deal with that pain, which most people can't on their own. you are not OP. nobody is trying to say he deserves any secret part of her, but if she doesn't get some support outside herself, she WILL face emotionally crippling difficulties in the future. that is non-negotiable, she does not deserve MORE pain just because she has already experienced the worst kind. be more thoughtful.", "This was my thought as well. Nobody is required to tell someone, even a fianc\u00e9, everything about their past. Most people see the death of a child as a big issue and seem to think one absolutely MUST share those big issues with someone they are marrying. But, as you pointed out, OP needs to deal with her trauma on her own terms. I would hope OP gets some therapy to work on this, but she is not required to tell anyone about it and nobody should bully her into it. \n\nFFS when you have a history of trauma, it can come out in any number of ways and in completely unrelated things. Hell, it could come out in a way OP doesn\u2019t even understand. She is not obligated to prepare her future husband to deal with whatever or however her past trauma surfaces. He is marrying her for better or worse, so let\u2019s hope he can take the negatives with positives rather than being pushy and judgmental about how she should deal with it.", "I think she\u2019ll come around. I\u2019m reading her responses and she seems to be realizing the importance of telling him. \n\nBTW not to be a pissant, but it\u2019s fianc\u00e9 (fianc\u00e9e is the woman).", "it got worse. People are accusing OP of not trusting her partner and saying she shouldn't get married if she's not ready to talk about it \n\nbuncha heartless gaping assholes ITT", "Even with that...the Ex witnessed it, but still blames her for it. And her sister. I mean, it could still truly be an accident. BUT, there are multiple people still blaming her for it.\n\nAnd I have a kid, and I am aware accidents happen and you cannot watch them every single second.\n\nIt just makes me wonder when there are multiple people still blaming her for it, especially one who was also there and witnessed it.\n\n(edited typos)", "I said those things in my post. And usually, when it's something along those lines, people realize it was just a mistake. And again, I mentioned in my one reply that as a mom, I know they cannot be watched every single second.\n\nBut unless you have bad luck and have BOTH a sucky ex and a sucky sister...you usually do not see multiple family blaming someone for a kid's death that was merely \"they looked away for a second and the child ran\". If it were just one person playing the blame game, I wouldn't have thought it as more serious than that.\n\nAnd in several of my replies, I put \"It's possible this isn't the case, but...\", and added why it seemed a bit sus to me.", "Yeah for sure. There are just a few things that stick out as flags to me on this one. There is a big difference between everyone blaming the person closest to the accident in the heat of the moment, and everyone STILL blaming that person years down the road. Some people do have bad luck- and get blamed unfairly for it, at that- but there are some things that stick out in this one.", "Tbh, even if it was preventable, at 15-18 OP was still very much a child herself, nothing excuses the comment that her sister made.", "She also says in the comment that the baby's father was also there, so she wasn't the only one watching the baby.\n\nThere's another reality of people who look for a scape goat to explain something horrible. A very young mother who already blames herself is a very easy target. I think her age alone would cause people to blame her, no matter what actually happened"]}
