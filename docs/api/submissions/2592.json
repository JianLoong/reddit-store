This is a huge part of your life, just like the case would be if you had previously been married and not told your fianc\u00e8. If the truth came out from someone else, your fianc\u00e8 would lose trust in you and also doubt himself as to why he wasn't good enough to know this information. Additionally- losing a child can create issues surrounding whether the grieving parent wants to have any future kids or not. You and your fianc\u00e8 need to be on the same page regarding wanting kids. If you have any doubts about having kids in the future, then your fianc\u00e8 should know in case this is a deal breaker for him, and also so he doesn't blame himself.\n\nI'd recommend you seek therapy for your grief, and to guide you through the honesty process.

To me this a lie by omission. Whether or you not had child is something most people would want to know about their significant other.
