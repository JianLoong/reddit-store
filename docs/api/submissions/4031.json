He and my mom (40f) coparented until I was one, but then she stopped coming to see me as often, and that eventually turned into her barely seeing me at all.\n\nWhen I was 4 she married her husband (43m), and they ended up moving away and having three kids together. I don\u2019t really know them that well, since I live in the same state as my dad and I didn\u2019t visit my mom much when I was younger.\n\nMy parents basically had an unofficial agreement when my mom left that she would pay my college tuition to make up for my dad never asking for child support.\nI\u2019m at a community college, and I\u2019ve gotten a few scholarships so the payments have never been above $600.\n\nI have a semester left until I graduate, and I\u2019ve already registered for the courses, so I texted my mom and told her what the down payment was and when it was due. She responded back saying that since I\u2019m an adult, and I have a job, I can afford the payments myself.\nI asked if she just couldn\u2019t afford to send anything right now, which would be fine, I wouldn\u2019t be upset about it or anything, but then she said that she shouldn\u2019t have to give money to me when I\u2019m grown and no longer her responsibility.\n\nI ended up paying for it because I didn\u2019t want to deal with the overcharge fees, but I had to pick up an extra shift at work since I still needed to afford other stuff.\nMy dad asked me why I was going in on my off day (I live at home with him) so I told him that I picked up another shift since I used my paycheck for tuition and I wanted to make up at least some money. He asked why I paid my tuition, and I said it was because my mom said she wouldn\u2019t.\n\nHe ended up calling my mom while I was at work, and basically telling her that if she didn\u2019t adhere to their agreement for as long as I\u2019m in school, then he was going to go for backpay on child support and formally charge her for it.\n\nShe texted me a few times, pissed that I told my dad about it. She said that it\u2019s only one semester, and I\u2019m an adult now so I should be expected to pay for it myself.\n\nI feel like a bit of an AH now since I guess I didn't really have to get my dad involved and tell him about it, but also like considering that the most she ever spent on me when I was a kid was the cost of a birthday card + postage stamp once a year, I think paying for community college is a fair trade.\n\nStill, I just wanted to know if I was TA here.", "created_utc": 1670261916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zddk1a/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_my_mom_wouldnt_pay/", "score": 1077, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep the lines of communication open with him, because I guarantee that if you let her get away with it this time, she will take full advantage. She won't pay for anymore college, especially if you are going to go get your bachelor's degree.  \n\nDon't let her get away with it.", "NTA\n\nTurn it around like this\n\nShe's an adult and should pay her bills? Guess what she didn't pay 18 years of them. She traded doing that for paying for your college. Now *she* wants a free ride. She's a hypocrite and a massive asshole", "NTA. This isn't just about college. This is about your dad working his butt off to raise you alone, without her help, on the promise that she would pay tuition. She made a promise to him. He deserves to see that promise through, and she doesn't just get to abandon her responsibilities.", "NTA - Not just community but all college. The money you could have received from mom with interest for 18 years I\u2019m sure would pay for college. What your mom has contributed is a pittance and I would seriously be concerned she won\u2019t pay when you go to 4 year. Dad should just sue because the fact he had to remind her of the agreement does not bode well on getting $$", "NTA, she didn't say it was only one semester, she told you behind your father's back that she was reneging on the agreement she made with him. The agreement between the two of them was that he would forgive the fact that she was such a deadbeat she didn't even pay her child support if she contributed to your college. She was hoping you wouldn't tell your dad so she could get away with not providing for you at all. Don't listen to her she's already let you know she doesn't care about you", "She had one job after abandoning you. Pay for college tuition in exchange for no child support. She tried to break the agreement. You do not owe this woman anything much less your loyalty.", "Tell your father your mother is harassing you so he can start the back pay for child support. Also tell your mother to f*ck right off, from me specifically. You can tell her an internet stranger would like to have some words", "NTA your dad needs to back charge her pathetic arse", "No no no, you're definitely NTA!!! Why wouldn't/ shouldn't you tell your dad about it? You owe your mother NOTHING and she can go fuck herself. She's the one that went back on her word of putting you through college and she got off lite on that too. I'm so glad your dad told her how it's going to work out if she doesn't pay. She should've been putting money aside for your education, seeing as she paid NO maintenance for basically your entire life. She can go suck a big old donkey dick!", "Your egg donor is a deadbeat.\n\nNTA.", "Hope father takes her for all she has NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s seriously going to sit there and say \u201cyour an adult, grow up and pay for yourself\u201d when she, a whole @ss adult, abandoned her child and never paid a dime towards her survival? Nah. I\u2019d be petty af and take her to court for every dime owed", "Your mom had a financial responsibility to you. Your dad was letting her pay towards you a bare minimum. She owes you that money. Owes, your dad. That was the agreement, and she's trying to get out of it. What she's required to pay is basically nothing. Nta", "Hello, for someone who knows a couple of people with giving/getting child support, I just wanted to let you know that I applaud you for not wanting to sue for back pay but I would suggest that your dad should. It is something she owes. It is going to be messy. Maybe your dad won't need it, maybe you won't but the fact that your mother had the audacity of getting angry because she won't pay your tuition instead of the owed child support is crazy. One thing", "Ironic she's so concerned with adult responsibiities but basically abandoned her first-born child. How very adult of her.", "It\u2019s relatively easy to get back pay. They will keep going after the parent and garnish their tax refunds, paycheck, etc. until the debt is settled."]}
