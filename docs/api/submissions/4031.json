He and my mom (40f) coparented until I was one, but then she stopped coming to see me as often, and that eventually turned into her barely seeing me at all.\n\nWhen I was 4 she married her husband (43m), and they ended up moving away and having three kids together. I don\u2019t really know them that well, since I live in the same state as my dad and I didn\u2019t visit my mom much when I was younger.\n\nMy parents basically had an unofficial agreement when my mom left that she would pay my college tuition to make up for my dad never asking for child support.\nI\u2019m at a community college, and I\u2019ve gotten a few scholarships so the payments have never been above $600.\n\nI have a semester left until I graduate, and I\u2019ve already registered for the courses, so I texted my mom and told her what the down payment was and when it was due. She responded back saying that since I\u2019m an adult, and I have a job, I can afford the payments myself.\nI asked if she just couldn\u2019t afford to send anything right now, which would be fine, I wouldn\u2019t be upset about it or anything, but then she said that she shouldn\u2019t have to give money to me when I\u2019m grown and no longer her responsibility.\n\nI ended up paying for it because I didn\u2019t want to deal with the overcharge fees, but I had to pick up an extra shift at work since I still needed to afford other stuff.\nMy dad asked me why I was going in on my off day (I live at home with him) so I told him that I picked up another shift since I used my paycheck for tuition and I wanted to make up at least some money. He asked why I paid my tuition, and I said it was because my mom said she wouldn\u2019t.\n\nHe ended up calling my mom while I was at work, and basically telling her that if she didn\u2019t adhere to their agreement for as long as I\u2019m in school, then he was going to go for backpay on child support and formally charge her for it.\n\nShe texted me a few times, pissed that I told my dad about it. She said that it\u2019s only one semester, and I\u2019m an adult now so I should be expected to pay for it myself.\n\nI feel like a bit of an AH now since I guess I didn't really have to get my dad involved and tell him about it, but also like considering that the most she ever spent on me when I was a kid was the cost of a birthday card + postage stamp once a year, I think paying for community college is a fair trade.\n\nStill, I just wanted to know if I was TA here.", "created_utc": 1670261916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zddk1a/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_my_mom_wouldnt_pay/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's money she owes you after she chose to have a child. Her other kids have two parents for their whole life to provide for them. Besides, you'll understand more if you ever have a child of your own why your dad is doing this. When it comes to your kids future and their well-being, most parents (not shit ones like your mom, good ones) will go scorched earth for them. You think your dad is gonna sit around happy and content while his kid  works herself empty cuz your deadbeat mom won't give you what you're due??", "NTA. Honestly, your dad needs to file for the back child support and give the money to you. It's ridiculous that she has reduced her contribution to your life to spawning you and slithering away. You deserve better. Shame on her. She's the disgrace, not you.  Tell your dad to file for the back child support. Go to university. Go to grad school. Good luck!", "Nta squeeze that backpay until that bottle starts making farting noises cuz there's no sauce left", "NTA go after it all", "Much respect to your dad. This was probably your mom's plan all along. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this, but you are NOT the AH.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right to get dad involved", "Regardless of how this goes, you should sue her for backpay child support. NTA.", "NTA. Your mom is mad she is busted because what dad could sue her for is WAY more than what she is paying now. You did nothing wrong. This is the agreement.", "NTA, your mom got off cheap.  Your dad was being generous giving them a second chance at this, be sure to tell your dad what your mom said to you after the discussion.", "NTA Go for the back pay anyway. Get some help for your future to make up for the neglect of your past.", "**NTA!** \n\nYour mom is trying to back out of an agreement she had without getting caught. It doesn\u2019t matter how your dad found out, the problem is that she tried to back out of the agreement. She made her own bed and, her attempting to avoid a $600 charge might cost her $50k in backpay **(which she legally owes you/your dad anyways!)**", "NTA.  That was the agreement she made your dad and she should keep up her end.  If you didn't put in all the hard work to earn the scholarships, she would pay a lot more.  Just remember this if,  you are making good money in a few years and she contacts you demanding some $$$.", "NTA. She owes you and your Dad a lot of money, and she agreed to this as the compromise.", "NTA- your mom is a deadbeat trying to weasel out of her responsibilities. Take the $$ and pay her no mind.", "NTA \n\nYour mom is a bad person. I'm sorry. She made a promise to weasel out of paying child support and now is trying to weasel out of that promise. She's fucking over and bullying you, her own child. I highly recommend therapy", "Sounds like your egg donor is a deadbeat while your dad is awesome. NTA", "NTA\n\nTell your Dad about this most recent conversation.  Encourage him to file for back support if that's possible.", "NTA and stop feeling guilty. Your mom has legal obligations to you that she\u2019s been able to fuck off from because your dad has been generous. Your mom owes you this tuition, it\u2019s not a \u201cnice to have\u201d. You\u2019re absolving her from being a shit parent to you.", "Absolutely NTA, she\u2019s way out of line if she seriously thinks you\u2019re going to lie to your dad about the money. I wish your dad luck with the back pay.", "NTA\n\nYour mom knew it was wrong which is why she wanted it kept quiet.  Keep repeating it NTA, this is the LEAST she could have done for you since she hasn't done anything else.", "NTA and please go thank your dad for backing you up. Your mom is awful", "Why would you feel like an AH for telling your dad the truth? Of course NTA, but my dear, I think you might need some therapy of the opinions of a woman who abandoned you and clearly doesn't even like you let alone love you are causing you to question your very correct decision.", "A child is entitled to be supported by both parents.  Dad upheld his end of the bargain; it's her turn.\n\nNTA", "My dad married a woman right after she got out of prison. She was in prison for neglecting her children. As a product of foster care, I want you to realize just how shitty you have to be to go to prison for child neglect!\n\nThe cherry, he met her while she was in prison. I'm assuming through a pen pal program?\n\nI don't know because I've been NC for many years.", "Also it was only $600? Ur \u201cmom\u201d been getting a sweet deal and tried to renegade. What a sad excuse for a parent. I\u2019m sorry OP", "Imagine being the mom and checking the mail one day to find legal paperwork saying you have to pay like 18 years worth of back child support. All because you didn't wanna fork over the cash for one semester of school lol", "We don't know what the agreement stated. A court can compel a noncustodial parent to pay for college. Or maybe there was a support order and mom was supposed to put the money into a college fund?\n\nEither way, nta. What were you supposed to do, lie to your father? Nah. She dug herself this hole.", "I noticed that too.  She is 20 years old, so mom has been paying for an \"adult\" to go to school for at least 2 years.\n\nand considering the normal age of a person to be in college is \"adult\", when did she ever feel obligated to fulfill her promise?", "Oh, OP, do t feel bad about this!!!!\n\nDo you really think these selfish grown ass adults are spending that in your siblings?\n\nYour dad sounds like a keeper. He likely wouldn't keep that money for himself, he would give it to you. Then you'd be in a position to help your siblings if you chose to.", "So if he wants to go after the backpay, let him. Your mother was stealing from him and trying to guilt you for bringing it up.", "\ud83d\udc95\u201cNo one else understands me like you do.\u201d\ud83d\udc95", "She's not an asshole, she just has compassion, that's all."]}
