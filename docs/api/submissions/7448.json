We have four children together. \n\nDue to the stupidity of the time and social pressure, I added my husband's last name to my name. So all my documents like identification, driver's license, passport, all credit cards, voter registration card have his last name at the end. \n\nWe ended amicably even more due to the circumstances (he is gay) and we divorced. \n\nHonestly, it would suck to have to change everything, go to government agencies, pay for everything new, go to the bank to change everything, so I didn't want to take out his last name, but I introduce myself by my maiden name, only in the documents is it this name. \n\nTony is currently engaged to a guy and they are going to get married in the next year. \n\nThe situation that happened was: \n\nOur son and his family decided to travel and invited me. He asked for my ID to make the reservations. \n\nA few days later, me, Tony and fiance were at my grandson's party. Our son said jokingly in the conversation circle that he couldn't believe that until today I hadn't changed my last name. I laughed, saying that I was too lazy to rush to change everything that has this name on it. \n\nTony started to ask if I really hadn't changed my name, if I didn't think that being engaged to someone else isn't the best time to change it, and he insisted that it was weird of me.\n\n I just replied: \"Unless you can go in my place, spend hours and hours in lines, pay hundreds for it, I won't do it in the near future\". \n\nWe stopped talking and the party flowed smoothly.\n\n Later, he called me and said I was acting weird and a jerk by refusing to change the name, which he said was uncomfortable.\n\nI asked our son and he said he understands my side of not wanting to do this, but he understands Tony's side of being uncomfortable with his ex using his last name after the divorce.\n\n So I ask for an outside opinion. \n\nAITA?\n\nI don't intend to never change, I just don't want to go through it right now", "created_utc": 1673836253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10d2lxk/aita_for_refusing_to_drop_my_exhusbands_last_name/", "score": 1193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If having his ex share a last name with him bothers him that much, then maybe he should take his fianc\u00e9's name after they marry.", "NTA. It is quite normal for someone to not change their last name after a divorce. I know women who have gotten remarried and didn\u2019t change their name even then because they wanted the same name as their children.", "NTA.  After 26 years that\u2019s your name.", "NTA - Sometimes people like to share a common last name with their kids. After 26 years, it's your name, do what you want.", "NTA. It was your name for TWENTY-SIX YEARS. Tony needs to chill tf out.", "NTA\n\nIn part this speaks to male privilege. We\u2019re expected to go through the rigmarole of changing our name and then expected to change it back but it\u2019s actually a massive pain in the arse. Also what if you have built a career under that name? Your hesitancy is completely understandable.", "NTA. It\u2019s not \u201chis\u201d name. It\u2019s your name unless you don\u2019t want it to be anymore\n\nI guess if your ex really wants a different name from you, he could pick a new one and legally change his. Why doesn\u2019t he take his boyfriend\u2019s last name?", "NTA. 26 years with a name, and a shared child with the same last name? No. You have no legal reason you need to change your name. The amount of work that goes into it is a hint PITA. You are allowed to keep that name if you want it. It\u2019s yours. Not by marriage, but because you already legally changed it decades ago.", "NTA.  I'm kind of puzzled by Tony \"being uncomfortable with his ex using HIS last name.\"   \n You had the name for 26 years - did Tony not consider it your name during that time?  Was he just loaning it to you on sufferance?\n\nThere are plenty of perfectly good reasons to keep his last name - your kids have that last name, all your documents are in that name, maybe you've used that name in your career, and yes, it is expensive and time consuming to change it.\n\nThe patriarchal concept of women taking their husband's last name bugs the crap out of me, but you've been that last name for 26 years.  No one gets to tell you when or why to change now.", "NTA. It\u2019s not up to men to tell women what name they\u2019re supposed to use. It\u2019s your legal surname as much as it is his.", "NTA you had to go through the work to change your name initially. Some women never change their names after divorce and they don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s your legal name and it\u2019s not preventing your ex from getting remarried. He\u2019s the one being weird.\n\nEdit for spelling", "Nta. Once a woman takes a name it is her\u2019s and she can keep it come divorce or high water.", "NTA\n\nI'm assuming your son has your ex-husband's surname so why shouldn't you have the same name as your offspring?\n\nIt's not as if it's unknown for divorced women to keep their married name.  Just look as Susan Sarandon.", "NTA you don't ever have to change it, changing over all your documents sucks and costs. If he wants a different last name to you he can change his name and find out what a pain it is.", "NTA. Not only is it part of your identity after 26 years, but it's another tie you have to your children. Idk what country you live in, but changing it on your social security card, license, job documents, passport, etc. can take months and hundreds of dollars. I completely get wanting to wait to change it. \n\nPlus if you have it on any degrees, job licenses, or official work papers, it's damn difficult to change it. \n\nYour ex's comfort is no longer your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nIt is YOUR name. You don\u2019t have to change it for anyone.", "Holy crap! It\u2019s been your name for 26 years. Why does everyone think your name doesn\u2019t belong to you anymore?\n\nCan people get any more sexist? It\u2019s 2023. Everyone seems to think that you were your husband\u2019s property and he had stamped his name on you, and now that you don\u2019t belong to him\u2026.he gets to wipe his name off of his ex-possession? Does no one know you are a PERSON?", "NTA- there are all sorts of reasons women decide to keep their married name after a divorce like wanting to keep the same last name as their kids, keeping a consistent identity, business/professional reasons or because changing your name is such a hassle like you said.", "NTA\n\nYou've had that last name for 28 years.  It's YOUR last name.  Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise can pound sand.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't own the name. You used it for 26 years because (as I gather from what you wrote) you were pressured to do it by people including your ex. It's your name now, so do whatever you want! Keep it forever, change it tomorrow... Doesn't matter what anyone else thinks (specially someone you divorced), you don't even need a reason.", "NTA. It\u2019s been your name for 26 years. Also, it\u2019s common for women to keep their married name even after divorce - a lot of people do it when they have kids with that name, built a professional career with that name, etc. If a person wants you to take their name in marriage, they should know you may decide to keep it even in divorce.", "NTA His problem with it seems to illustrate that you taking his name in the first place meant that you belonged to him. Like writing his name on his lunch before putting it in the office fridge. Now that you\u2019re not his anymore, he doesn\u2019t want you wearing his name. It\u2019s patriarchal bullshit. You took his name to join his family. You had children together so now you\u2019re a part of the family forever. You\u2019re not his former property.", "NTA \n\nAfter 26 years and 4 children, it's your name. It's your decision what to do with your name. Some women retatain their marital name (for a multitude of reasons) post divorce. Some do not (for a multitude of reasons).\n\nYou aren't obligated to change your name because your marriage ended. You're not obligated to change your name because \"Tony\" is remarrying. You aren't obligated to change your name, period. It's 100% your decision.", "NTA, If he wants it changed so badly he should pay to do it. You've had that name for around 26 years i say its yours to keep, it really is a hassle to change government documents.", "nta.  It is not \"his\" last name.  It is yours too.  It's not like you were married a year with no kids.", "NTA. My mom got married at 21 and was married for 27 yrs. At that point she had her married last name for longer than her birth name. Her entire adult identity  was built around that name. I don\u2019t think there was ever a thought for her to change her name back to her maiden name and I think not changing names is pretty common after the end of a long term marriage.", "NTA.  There is a good chance this has been your last name longer than your original last name.  Lots of people have different legal names than common use names.  Lots of divorced women keeps their ex names just to be the same as their children.  I know plenty of divorcee women where that it the case.\n\nHe\u2019s your ex.  He doesn\u2019t get a say anymore.", "NTA. I refused to take my Husband's last name purely due to the time, money, and hassle it takes to change it on all my documents. I don't think many people realize how costly it is either. No thanks. You're totally entitled to do whatever you want. Honestly, what's he going to do, have a salty attitude for life? Seems like a him problem.", "NTA. The moment you decided to take your ex's name it became *your* name. He didn't get the last name in  the divorce. It is immutably yours until such point that *you* decide you wish to change it.\n\nDepending on where you live it might be free/relatively cheap to change your name upon marrying, but relatively expensive for any other reason, including divorce. You should not have to occur this additional expense.\n\nMy parents were legally separated for longer than they were together and eventually divorced. My mother never went back to using her maiden name, it wasn't worth the hassle. She didn't have the money to change it, and even if she did it would be a waste. She also wanted the same last name as her children. The *only* time my dad ever mentioned it was jokingly referring to there being 2 \"Mrs Smiths\" when he was getting remarried. Mum shut it down by offering the pre-prepared paperwork saying that he agreed to have his children change their last name and that he would pay half for all of us to do so. When his new wife mentioned it once it was the only time I ever saw my dad shut her down.\n\nYour husband is an AH. If he doesn't want to have the same last name as you *he* should change his name (and deal with the massive pain of having a \"prior identity\" for the rest of his life).", "Absolutely keep the same last name as your beloved children. \n\nThat is your right.  You are their Mother. \n\nTony is the one who is weird, and a jerk. He shouldn\u2019t make YOU uncomfortable.\n\nEdited to add:  NTA", "NTA. Why should you change your name? Especially when it's been your name for so long. \n\n\"Due to the stupidity of the time and social pressure ...\"\n\nThe social pressure is for the wife to take and the husband to give his name. Not for the wife to borrow and the husband to loan. It's not his to demand back.", "NTA. Like you say, if he wants it done he can do all the hard work and pay for it. My mom kept my dads last name after they divorced (after almost 2 decades of marriage) and he never thought it was weird or tried to get her to change it.", "NTA\n\nMy parent were married for 30 years. She took his last name as a teenager. It's who she is. She never even thought to change it back after they divorced", "NTA, my mom kept her married name after my parents divorced. It was the name with her work history as well as the last name her children have. Its unreasonable of them to expect you to change it, especially after having it for 26 years.", "NTA. You had that name for a quarter of a century. It\u2019s yours. He doesn\u2019t get to say when you change it.", "NTA. Changing your name is a huge pain.", "NTA. You took his last name as yours, you didn't borrow it.  It's your name unless you choose to make it different.  How dare your ex even have an opinion on this.", "No.\nIt\u2019s not his last name, it\u2019s your children\u2019s last name.  \n\nHe can change his name.", "NTA, tell him he can pay for it. It is a complete pain in the ass to change your name and, when you took the name, I\u2019m sure you fully intended to keep it for life. Things didn\u2019t work out that way, but that isn\u2019t your fault. Also, if that is your kids\u2019 last name (I\u2019m assuming it is) I wouldn\u2019t want to change it anyways because I\u2019d want to have the same last name as my kids. Your ex and his fianc\u00e9 are the ones being weird imo.", "NTA. You've developed an identity with your ex's name separate from the relationship that gave it to you. Friends, activities, groups, memories. Maybe there's something about the name that just clicks for you. For nearly three decades you've been OP \\[Married name\\]. You don't need to change it back to your maiden name if you don't want to.", "NTA. I know someone who did not change her last name after her divorce because she did not want to A) go through that pain in the butt and B) have a different last name from her children. Totally get where you're coming from.", "NTA. I was divorced from my first husband and changed my name- mostly because I had stupidly hyphenated it and my name was annoying. But I've changed name again when I got remarried, and if we ever divorce, I'm not changing it. It's my children's last name. And I happen to like it.", "NTA \n\nMy mother kept my Father's last name so that she would have the same last name as us. Even when she remarried she literally just hyphenated my dad's last name-her husbands last name!", "After 26 years of marriage, that has been your last name for a large portion of your life. It's also the last name of your children, and it's your name too, so you can choose to keep it forever if you want to\n\nNTA", "When my childhood BFF's parents got divorced, her mother kept her married name for the same reasons as yours, plus she liked who she was as her married name as opposed to the baggage that came with who she was when she was single.\n\nLuckily, her ex's new wife kept her name (which ironically was her ex's last name.)\n\n\"Sorry honey, there was no provision on surname custody in the divorce decree, so you and your STBH will just have to deal with sharing. \"\n\nNTA.  I would keep it out of spite, but I am petty that way. :)", "Tell Tony to change his last name to his new husbands and see how he does with it", "Ah hell no!\n\nMy children asked me to keep their last name, which I did until I remarried. After my second divorce I went back to my maiden name and will NEVER change it again.\n\nA gal I work with just changed her name after being married 2 years. \n\nIt's seriously hate name changing. It's the biggest PITA.\n\nNTA", "NTA, that name is part of who you are, you do not need to change in.  Your ex is an ass for asking.", "NTA.\nYou have it because of archaic gender role traditions of the time.\nAside from the pain of changing it, it's also the name of your kids and it's been your name for 28 years.\n\nIt's fine for him to be weirded out by it, but it's not your fault to have to bear the cost and time to correct it just because you're a woman.

No issues. \n\nNTA for keeping your last name.", "NTA. If you married young, as I did, you\u2019ve had your married name longer than your maiden name. Keep it if you want to. Tony can go kick rocks.", "NTA. After 36 years the name is yours", "NTA by god you've had the name for a fecking long time, I think you have some rights to it at this point", "NTA.  It's pretty common for people to not change their name again, especially if they've established themselves professionally.  Certainly I wouldn't do it.  Had I realized what a pain it was going to be, I wouldn't have done it initially, either!  Suggest that your ex can change his last name to his fiance's when they marry so there is no confusion.", "NTA - I haven\u2019t changed my name because it is a massive pain in the rear. They have no idea how much time it takes to change the name.", "NTA. It\u2019s a pain in the ass. My mom didn\u2019t drop our last name when she got remarried.", "NTA. It's your legal name and has been for a quarter century. You can change it if you want, when you want. Heck you don't even go by it, it's just legal on paperwork.", "NTA. If it bothers him that much he can change his name. Maybe take his fiance's name lol", "NTA\n\nChanging a name is a headache and if you have one thing out of place, such as a password that says ABC and your licensed says AB, you\u2019re effed.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you at all for not wanting to do it.

I wouldn\u2019t change it at all.", "NTA\n\nWhat last name do your children have? If they have his last name, you are even less of TA. You used this name as your last name for 26 years. It\u2019s absolute nonsense to expect you to change it now.\n\nHaving said all that, I did change my last name back to my maiden name when I got my divorce after 22 years of marriage. But it was my choice. It was because I wanted it, not because someone else told me I should do it.", "No you aren't. \nLegal name changes are such a pain in the butt.\nI'm finally back to my maiden name and I'll never change it again.", "NTA, that is YOUR name.

He doesn\u2019t get to tell you what to do with YOUR name.", "NTA It\u2019s a pain to change everything. I still have my ex husbands last name because of the kids. I remember hearing Martha Stewart kept her husbands last name because she had already built her brand around it. Your ex can whine all he wants but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to do what he says.", "NTA. This is a weird argument that comes up on reddit a lot. When your ex-husband gave you his name, it became your name. It belongs to you now. You can change it later or never. It doesn't matter what he thinks about it because the name isn't his property.", "NTA \n\nKudos for him coming out and living the life he wants. However, it's not just \"his\" name anymore.

Completely reasonable to hang onto it if for no other reason than keeping it the same as your kid's.\n\nI know a lot of folks who have been divorced and the only one who ever changed her last name was one who remarried.

We have four children together. \n\nDue to the stupidity of the time and social pressure, I added my husband's last name to my name. So all my documents like identification, driver's license, passport, all credit cards, voter registration card have his last name at the end. \n\nWe ended amicably even more due to the circumstances (he is gay) and we divorced. \n\nHonestly, it would suck to have to change everything, go to government agencies, pay for everything new, go to the bank to change everything, so I didn't want to take out his last name, but I introduce myself by my maiden name, only in the documents is it this name. \n\nTony is currently engaged to a guy and they are going to get married in the next year. \n\nThe situation that happened was: \n\nOur son and his family decided to travel and invited me. He asked for my ID to make the reservations. \n\nA few days later, me, Tony and fiance were at my grandson's party. Our son said jokingly in the conversation circle that he couldn't believe that until today I hadn't changed my last name. I laughed, saying that I was too lazy to rush to change everything that has this name on it. \n\nTony started to ask if I really hadn't changed my name, if I didn't think that being engaged to someone else isn't the best time to change it, and he insisted that it was weird of me.\n\n I just replied: \"Unless you can go in my place, spend hours and hours in lines, pay hundreds for it, I won't do it in the near future\". \n\nWe stopped talking and the party flowed smoothly.\n\n Later, he called me and said I was acting weird and a jerk by refusing to change the name, which he said was uncomfortable.\n\nI asked our son and he said he understands my side of not wanting to do this, but he understands Tony's side of being uncomfortable with his ex using his last name after the divorce.\n\n So I ask for an outside opinion. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My ex didn't change her last name and it never occurred to me to be bothered by it.", "NTA. I worked with a divorced woman who kept her married name on everything but her Facebook for this exact reason- it\u2019s expensive, takes forever, and makes issues when you have to do things for your kids. My mom kept her maiden name and gave it to me for this exact circumstance", "NTA. I\u2019m confused as to why he has an issue when you ended amicably.", "The ex has NO say in what name OP chooses, none whatsoever.  Lots of divorced moms want to keep their last name the same as their kids. It\u2019s not his business. NTA", "Nope, NTA and that is YOUR NAME. It\u2019s been your name for 26 years. Fuck Tony and his strange sense of ownership over what your official documents say. \n\nI\u2019m sure he pushed you to change your name when you got married, right? Welp, that\u2019s it, Tony. You only get to force someone to change her name once per lifetime.", "NTA and you really don't ever need to change it.  It IS your name and has been for 26 years.  I was married for 20 years and been divorced for 20 years (never remarried).  I still have my married last name and always will.  Yes, it is the same last name as my 3 children too.", "Pffft.l. NTA. My father Mr X, has 3 Mrs X's floating around out there (divorced from all) and it's never been an issue. Surprisingly not something that makes a difference. If his son hasn't said, he would never know. There are bigger problems in life.", "NTA. Oh please. I was married for almost 10 years. I\u2019ve been divorced nearly as long. And I still have my married name. And my ex is in wife number 3 at this point. So whatever. \n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s a pain in the ass to change your name. \n\nYour last name is literally none of his business.", "NTA, unless he thought of the name himself, and it's totally dope.\n\nIn all seriousness, as other people have noted, you did the standard thing for women and took his name as part of your marriage, and have legitimate reasons to keep using it. You're in the clear here, and shouldn't let anyone else make you feel bad about it.\n\nThat said, you say it ended amicably, is there a chance that his feelings on this are more complicated than he indicated? Does he think you're hung up on him or the marriage? Is worried his fiance will be weirded out by it? Is he prone to anxiety, etc?\n\nIt might be NAH, without information it's hard to tell. But one thing's for sure, you're in the clear. Don't let anyone knock you around or make you feel bad about it, but it sounds like your relationship with him matters and it's possible that understanding his feelings on the matter in more detail might help how you feel. Or, better yet, you may be able to address them with logic and help how he feels too!", "NTA, I totally feel ya, I wouldn\u2019t waste my time with all that either. What does it even matter anyways!?", "INFO\n\nWhy can't Tony take his husband's name just like you did 28 years ago? Then there wouldn't be a name shared with his ex anymore.", "My mom kept her married name until she died. They had been divorced for 20 years. \nMy sister still had her married name after divorce because her children had the same last name. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your name now. It is literally part of your identity. It is legally yours.", "Nta, it's your name, it's your children's name.  He doesn't get a say in that.", "NTA. \n\nYour marriage was of long duration and you gave into societal pressure to change it the first time. You don\u2019t have to do it again. You having a double-barrel surname that you\u2019ve had for almost three decades has no bearing on your husband\u2019s subsequent marriage. He can calm down and stop trying to put more of an admin burden on you.", "Exactly. It\u2019s customary that men demand women take on their last name and that the children also get the man\u2019s last name. At that point i think the man also needs to accept that in the event of a divorce the woman might not want to change her identity or have a different last name to her kids. \n\nSo men might start consider to take on their wives last name if they have a problem with this or come up with a different solution.", "This right here. When men want their partners to take their names, they don't get to demand them back. If they're not cool with partners keeping the name after divorce, they should discuss other options at marriage.", "28 years actually! It\u2019s totally her name and Quixote frankly, it was her name on Day 1 so up to her to choose how to use it and for how long.", "I hate that logic that implies that women never get to own our own surnames.\n\nThe people pressuring us to change our names on marriage say that our birth-surnames are really our father's names, so it should be no big deal to take our husband's name.\n\nThen, if we do change our surname and then divorce, they say that our surname was really only a loan and that we should give it back. It's such a bullshit proposition that we're pressured to take on all the sacrifice to have a single family surname, and then not even get to *keep* the benefit of sharing a surname with the kids.\n\nThe whole thing is frustrating and sexist.", "Yeah, \"male privilege\" isn't my goto for explaining things, but here... it's an interesting take that I'm inclined to agree with. I wonder if the ex husband would feel differently if it were cast in this light?\n\nIn my experience, as male human who has met other male human before, being male is a great way to not see the effects of male privilege, especially in more subtle situations like this.", "Yup, my aunt had this issue.  She published papers under her married name, and when she divorced, she didn't want to lose that connection when she reverted to her maiden name.  She ended up doing a hyphenated maiden-former married last name combo in order to be able to keep that link.", "Well and the idea that it\u2019s his name is a joke. The minute she took it, it became her name. She doesn\u2019t have his name anymore than he has hers. \n\nHe\u2019s asking her to change her name to not match his.", "My parents have been DIVORCED for 26yrs and my mom still occasionally uses her married name because it's just on so many goddamn documents.

She decided to keep it because of kids and grandkids. But also she only had her maiden name for 20 years. She had her married name for nearly 40 by the point of divorce.  Why would she revert all of her documents for a maiden name she\u2019d had half the length of her married name? She became a teacher after she married, she\u2019d answered to Mrs Married Name her entire career and literally never answered to Ms Maiden Name in the classroom and was still working at that point. \n\nMy ex MIL did end up with the same last name as her grandchildren, my children, because even though I kept my name I caved and gave the kids their dad\u2019s surname when he put a lot of pressure on me (I wish I hadn\u2019t). So clearly *he* wanted matching last names with his kids but couldn\u2019t see why his mother might want it too.", "yeah, my father's first wife had my 3 siblings, were married 20 years then divorced, and once you're an X Family people tend to keep the name so she always did, even after daddy married my mom and had me. most of the ex-wives of my uncles kept the name, and those born with the name usually hyphenate if they take a married name. I've never seen anything wrong with keeping a married name or the name of your children. sometimes they'll have had the married name longer than the maiden name! if I marry or take on my adoptive dad's name, it'll be hyphenated.", "Can confirm. I was given a bit of grief by my parents and my ex but I said no, I wasn't going to stop sharing a last name with the most important family members I have, my kids. I divorced their dad, not them! No way I'm going to stop sharing their last name.", "Not to mention, it can be a nightmare with schools and doctors. It gets worse when your ex gets remarried, because then teachers/doctors assume the stepmom is the biological mom, even if you're the one with custody. There are just so many issues that arise.", "Aside from the emotional impact, there are a lot of real-world aspects to it. Picking up kids with a different last name. Booking a hotel room with/for your kids. Etc.", "Yep. No take-backs. My mother hates her maiden name and in spite of divorce and remarriage, hasn\u2019t bothered to legally change her name again. She goes legally by her 1st husband\u2019s and socially by her second husband\u2019s.", "> So his ex-wife and her new wife both have his last name.\n\nI don't know why but god this tickled me so much!", "If I were the ex, I would find so much humor in this. A name so good, you don't even have to do the marrying to spread it.", "My parents were married 29 years. My dad doesn't give a shit she still uses his name either 20 years later. They've both since remarried, and she took her new husband's surname, but she didn't want her new initials to be ASS lol. She told me she was going to make my dad's surname her middle instead to be AAS, because his surname was still her name.
