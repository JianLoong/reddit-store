We have four children together. \n\nDue to the stupidity of the time and social pressure, I added my husband's last name to my name. So all my documents like identification, driver's license, passport, all credit cards, voter registration card have his last name at the end. \n\nWe ended amicably even more due to the circumstances (he is gay) and we divorced. \n\nHonestly, it would suck to have to change everything, go to government agencies, pay for everything new, go to the bank to change everything, so I didn't want to take out his last name, but I introduce myself by my maiden name, only in the documents is it this name. \n\nTony is currently engaged to a guy and they are going to get married in the next year. \n\nThe situation that happened was: \n\nOur son and his family decided to travel and invited me. He asked for my ID to make the reservations. \n\nA few days later, me, Tony and fiance were at my grandson's party. Our son said jokingly in the conversation circle that he couldn't believe that until today I hadn't changed my last name. I laughed, saying that I was too lazy to rush to change everything that has this name on it. \n\nTony started to ask if I really hadn't changed my name, if I didn't think that being engaged to someone else isn't the best time to change it, and he insisted that it was weird of me.\n\n I just replied: \"Unless you can go in my place, spend hours and hours in lines, pay hundreds for it, I won't do it in the near future\". \n\nWe stopped talking and the party flowed smoothly.\n\n Later, he called me and said I was acting weird and a jerk by refusing to change the name, which he said was uncomfortable.\n\nI asked our son and he said he understands my side of not wanting to do this, but he understands Tony's side of being uncomfortable with his ex using his last name after the divorce.\n\n So I ask for an outside opinion. \n\nAITA?\n\nI don't intend to never change, I just don't want to go through it right now", "created_utc": 1673836253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10d2lxk/aita_for_refusing_to_drop_my_exhusbands_last_name/", "score": 11434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If having his ex share a last name with him bothers him that much, then maybe he should take his fianc\u00e9's name after they marry.", "NTA. It is quite normal for someone to not change their last name after a divorce. I know women who have gotten remarried and didn\u2019t change their name even then because they wanted the same name as their children.", "NTA.  After 26 years that\u2019s your name.", "NTA - Sometimes people like to share a common last name with their kids. After 26 years, it's your name, do what you want.", "NTA. It was your name for TWENTY-SIX YEARS. Tony needs to chill tf out.", "NTA\n\nIn part this speaks to male privilege. We\u2019re expected to go through the rigmarole of changing our name and then expected to change it back but it\u2019s actually a massive pain in the arse. Also what if you have built a career under that name? Your hesitancy is completely understandable.", "NTA. It\u2019s not \u201chis\u201d name. It\u2019s your name unless you don\u2019t want it to be anymore\n\nI guess if your ex really wants a different name from you, he could pick a new one and legally change his. Why doesn\u2019t he take his boyfriend\u2019s last name?", "NTA. 26 years with a name, and a shared child with the same last name? No. You have no legal reason you need to change your name. The amount of work that goes into it is a hint PITA. You are allowed to keep that name if you want it. It\u2019s yours. Not by marriage, but because you already legally changed it decades ago.", "NTA.  I'm kind of puzzled by Tony \"being uncomfortable with his ex using HIS last name.\"   \n You had the name for 26 years - did Tony not consider it your name during that time?  Was he just loaning it to you on sufferance?\n\nThere are plenty of perfectly good reasons to keep his last name - your kids have that last name, all your documents are in that name, maybe you've used that name in your career, and yes, it is expensive and time consuming to change it.\n\nThe patriarchal concept of women taking their husband's last name bugs the crap out of me, but you've been that last name for 26 years.  No one gets to tell you when or why to change now.", "NTA. It\u2019s not up to men to tell women what name they\u2019re supposed to use. It\u2019s your legal surname as much as it is his.", "NTA you had to go through the work to change your name initially. Some women never change their names after divorce and they don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s your legal name and it\u2019s not preventing your ex from getting remarried. He\u2019s the one being weird.\n\nEdit for spelling", "Nta. Once a woman takes a name it is her\u2019s and she can keep it come divorce or high water.", "NTA\n\nI'm assuming your son has your ex-husband's surname so why shouldn't you have the same name as your offspring?\n\nIt's not as if it's unknown for divorced women to keep their married name.  Just look as Susan Sarandon.", "NTA you don't ever have to change it, changing over all your documents sucks and costs. If he wants a different last name to you he can change his name and find out what a pain it is.", "NTA. Not only is it part of your identity after 26 years, but it's another tie you have to your children. Idk what country you live in, but changing it on your social security card, license, job documents, passport, etc. can take months and hundreds of dollars. I completely get wanting to wait to change it. \n\nPlus if you have it on any degrees, job licenses, or official work papers, it's damn difficult to change it. \n\nYour ex's comfort is no longer your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nIt is YOUR name. You don\u2019t have to change it for anyone.", "Holy crap! It\u2019s been your name for 26 years. Why does everyone think your name doesn\u2019t belong to you anymore?\n\nCan people get any more sexist? It\u2019s 2023. Everyone seems to think that you were your husband\u2019s property and he had stamped his name on you, and now that you don\u2019t belong to him\u2026.he gets to wipe his name off of his ex-possession? Does no one know you are a PERSON?", "NTA- there are all sorts of reasons women decide to keep their married name after a divorce like wanting to keep the same last name as their kids, keeping a consistent identity, business/professional reasons or because changing your name is such a hassle like you said.", "NTA\n\nYou've had that last name for 28 years.  It's YOUR last name.  Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise can pound sand.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't own the name. You used it for 26 years because (as I gather from what you wrote) you were pressured to do it by people including your ex. It's your name now, so do whatever you want! Keep it forever, change it tomorrow... Doesn't matter what anyone else thinks (specially someone you divorced), you don't even need a reason.", "NTA. It\u2019s been your name for 26 years. Also, it\u2019s common for women to keep their married name even after divorce - a lot of people do it when they have kids with that name, built a professional career with that name, etc. If a person wants you to take their name in marriage, they should know you may decide to keep it even in divorce.", "NTA His problem with it seems to illustrate that you taking his name in the first place meant that you belonged to him. Like writing his name on his lunch before putting it in the office fridge. Now that you\u2019re not his anymore, he doesn\u2019t want you wearing his name. It\u2019s patriarchal bullshit. You took his name to join his family. You had children together so now you\u2019re a part of the family forever. You\u2019re not his former property.", "NTA \n\nAfter 26 years and 4 children, it's your name. It's your decision what to do with your name. Some women retatain their marital name (for a multitude of reasons) post divorce. Some do not (for a multitude of reasons).\n\nYou aren't obligated to change your name because your marriage ended. You're not obligated to change your name because \"Tony\" is remarrying. You aren't obligated to change your name, period. It's 100% your decision.", "NTA, If he wants it changed so badly he should pay to do it. You've had that name for around 26 years i say its yours to keep, it really is a hassle to change government documents.", "nta.  It is not \"his\" last name.  It is yours too.  It's not like you were married a year with no kids.", "NTA. My mom got married at 21 and was married for 27 yrs. At that point she had her married last name for longer than her birth name. Her entire adult identity  was built around that name. I don\u2019t think there was ever a thought for her to change her name back to her maiden name and I think not changing names is pretty common after the end of a long term marriage.", "NTA.  There is a good chance this has been your last name longer than your original last name.  Lots of people have different legal names than common use names.  Lots of divorced women keeps their ex names just to be the same as their children.  I know plenty of divorcee women where that it the case.\n\nHe\u2019s your ex.  He doesn\u2019t get a say anymore.", "NTA. I refused to take my Husband's last name purely due to the time, money, and hassle it takes to change it on all my documents. I don't think many people realize how costly it is either. No thanks. You're totally entitled to do whatever you want. Honestly, what's he going to do, have a salty attitude for life? Seems like a him problem.", "NTA. The moment you decided to take your ex's name it became *your* name. He didn't get the last name in  the divorce. It is immutably yours until such point that *you* decide you wish to change it.\n\nDepending on where you live it might be free/relatively cheap to change your name upon marrying, but relatively expensive for any other reason, including divorce. You should not have to occur this additional expense.\n\nMy parents were legally separated for longer than they were together and eventually divorced. My mother never went back to using her maiden name, it wasn't worth the hassle. She didn't have the money to change it, and even if she did it would be a waste. She also wanted the same last name as her children. The *only* time my dad ever mentioned it was jokingly referring to there being 2 \"Mrs Smiths\" when he was getting remarried. Mum shut it down by offering the pre-prepared paperwork saying that he agreed to have his children change their last name and that he would pay half for all of us to do so. When his new wife mentioned it once it was the only time I ever saw my dad shut her down.\n\nYour husband is an AH. If he doesn't want to have the same last name as you *he* should change his name (and deal with the massive pain of having a \"prior identity\" for the rest of his life).", "Absolutely keep the same last name as your beloved children. \n\nThat is your right.  You are their Mother. \n\nTony is the one who is weird, and a jerk. He shouldn\u2019t make YOU uncomfortable.\n\nEdited to add:  NTA", "NTA. Why should you change your name? Especially when it's been your name for so long. \n\n\"Due to the stupidity of the time and social pressure ...\"\n\nThe social pressure is for the wife to take and the husband to give his name. Not for the wife to borrow and the husband to loan. It's not his to demand back.", "NTA. Like you say, if he wants it done he can do all the hard work and pay for it. My mom kept my dads last name after they divorced (after almost 2 decades of marriage) and he never thought it was weird or tried to get her to change it.", "NTA\n\nMy parent were married for 30 years. She took his last name as a teenager. It's who she is. She never even thought to change it back after they divorced", "NTA, my mom kept her married name after my parents divorced. It was the name with her work history as well as the last name her children have. Its unreasonable of them to expect you to change it, especially after having it for 26 years.", "NTA. You had that name for a quarter of a century. It\u2019s yours. He doesn\u2019t get to say when you change it.", "NTA. Changing your name is a huge pain.", "NTA. You took his last name as yours, you didn't borrow it.  It's your name unless you choose to make it different.  How dare your ex even have an opinion on this.", "No.\nIt\u2019s not his last name, it\u2019s your children\u2019s last name.  \n\nHe can change his name.", "NTA, tell him he can pay for it. It is a complete pain in the ass to change your name and, when you took the name, I\u2019m sure you fully intended to keep it for life. Things didn\u2019t work out that way, but that isn\u2019t your fault. Also, if that is your kids\u2019 last name (I\u2019m assuming it is) I wouldn\u2019t want to change it anyways because I\u2019d want to have the same last name as my kids. Your ex and his fianc\u00e9 are the ones being weird imo.", "NTA. You've developed an identity with your ex's name separate from the relationship that gave it to you. Friends, activities, groups, memories. Maybe there's something about the name that just clicks for you. For nearly three decades you've been OP \\[Married name\\]. You don't need to change it back to your maiden name if you don't want to.", "NTA. I know someone who did not change her last name after her divorce because she did not want to A) go through that pain in the butt and B) have a different last name from her children. Totally get where you're coming from.", "NTA. I was divorced from my first husband and changed my name- mostly because I had stupidly hyphenated it and my name was annoying. But I've changed name again when I got remarried, and if we ever divorce, I'm not changing it. It's my children's last name. And I happen to like it.", "NTA \n\nMy mother kept my Father's last name so that she would have the same last name as us. Even when she remarried she literally just hyphenated my dad's last name-her husbands last name!", "After 26 years of marriage, that has been your last name for a large portion of your life. It's also the last name of your children, and it's your name too, so you can choose to keep it forever if you want to\n\nNTA", "When my childhood BFF's parents got divorced, her mother kept her married name for the same reasons as yours, plus she liked who she was as her married name as opposed to the baggage that came with who she was when she was single.\n\nLuckily, her ex's new wife kept her name (which ironically was her ex's last name.)\n\n\"Sorry honey, there was no provision on surname custody in the divorce decree, so you and your STBH will just have to deal with sharing. \"\n\nNTA.  I would keep it out of spite, but I am petty that way. :)", "Tell Tony to change his last name to his new husbands and see how he does with it", "Ah hell no!\n\nMy children asked me to keep their last name, which I did until I remarried. After my second divorce I went back to my maiden name and will NEVER change it again.\n\nA gal I work with just changed her name after being married 2 years. \n\nIt's seriously hate name changing. It's the biggest PITA.\n\nNTA", "NTA, that name is part of who you are, you do not need to change in.  Your ex is an ass for asking.", "NTA.\nYou have it because of archaic gender role traditions of the time.\nAside from the pain of changing it, it's also the name of your kids and it's been your name for 28 years.\n\nIt's fine for him to be weirded out by it, but it's not your fault to have to bear the cost and time to correct it just because you're a woman.

No issues. \n\nNTA for keeping your last name.", "NTA. If you married young, as I did, you\u2019ve had your married name longer than your maiden name. Keep it if you want to. Tony can go kick rocks.", "NTA. After 36 years the name is yours", "NTA by god you've had the name for a fecking long time, I think you have some rights to it at this point", "NTA.  It's pretty common for people to not change their name again, especially if they've established themselves professionally.  Certainly I wouldn't do it.  Had I realized what a pain it was going to be, I wouldn't have done it initially, either!  Suggest that your ex can change his last name to his fiance's when they marry so there is no confusion.", "NTA - I haven\u2019t changed my name because it is a massive pain in the rear. They have no idea how much time it takes to change the name.", "NTA. It\u2019s a pain in the ass. My mom didn\u2019t drop our last name when she got remarried.", "NTA. It's your legal name and has been for a quarter century. You can change it if you want, when you want. Heck you don't even go by it, it's just legal on paperwork.", "NTA. If it bothers him that much he can change his name. Maybe take his fiance's name lol", "NTA\n\nChanging a name is a headache and if you have one thing out of place, such as a password that says ABC and your licensed says AB, you\u2019re effed.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you at all for not wanting to do it. Add it to your \u201cto do list\u201d.", "NTA - it\u2019s been your name for 26 years and your children have that name. I wouldn\u2019t change it at all.", "NTA\n\nWhat last name do your children have? If they have his last name, you are even less of TA. You used this name as your last name for 26 years. It\u2019s absolute nonsense to expect you to change it now.\n\nHaving said all that, I did change my last name back to my maiden name when I got my divorce after 22 years of marriage. But it was my choice. It was because I wanted it, not because someone else told me I should do it.", "No you aren't. \nLegal name changes are such a pain in the butt.\nI'm finally back to my maiden name and I'll never change it again.", "NTA, that is YOUR name.

He doesn\u2019t get to tell you what to do with YOUR name.", "NTA It\u2019s a pain to change everything. I still have my ex husbands last name because of the kids. I remember hearing Martha Stewart kept her husbands last name because she had already built her brand around it. Your ex can whine all he wants but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to do what he says.", "NTA. This is a weird argument that comes up on reddit a lot. When your ex-husband gave you his name, it became your name. It belongs to you now. You can change it later or never. It doesn't matter what he thinks about it because the name isn't his property.", "NTA \n\nKudos for him coming out and living the life he wants. However, it's not just \"his\" name anymore. You built a life with him and the name is just as much yours than it is his.\n\nI get coming out is hard and that living a closeted life may have felt like his only option but he purposely intertwined his life with yours. He shouldn't be the one that dictates what name you use. \n\nI could be completely in left field here, but it seems like he has no respect for your feelings. You do what you want to do. You owe him nothing.

Completely reasonable to hang onto it if for no other reason than keeping it the same as your kid's.\n\nI know a lot of folks who have been divorced and the only one who ever changed her last name was one who remarried.

We have four children together. \n\nDue to the stupidity of the time and social pressure, I added my husband's last name to my name. So all my documents like identification, driver's license, passport, all credit cards, voter registration card have his last name at the end. \n\nWe ended amicably even more due to the circumstances (he is gay) and we divorced. \n\nHonestly, it would suck to have to change everything, go to government agencies, pay for everything new, go to the bank to change everything, so I didn't want to take out his last name, but I introduce myself by my maiden name, only in the documents is it this name. \n\nTony is currently engaged to a guy and they are going to get married in the next year. \n\nThe situation that happened was: \n\nOur son and his family decided to travel and invited me. He asked for my ID to make the reservations. \n\nA few days later, me, Tony and fiance were at my grandson's party. Our son said jokingly in the conversation circle that he couldn't believe that until today I hadn't changed my last name. I laughed, saying that I was too lazy to rush to change everything that has this name on it. \n\nTony started to ask if I really hadn't changed my name, if I didn't think that being engaged to someone else isn't the best time to change it, and he insisted that it was weird of me.\n\n I just replied: \"Unless you can go in my place, spend hours and hours in lines, pay hundreds for it, I won't do it in the near future\". \n\nWe stopped talking and the party flowed smoothly.\n\n Later, he called me and said I was acting weird and a jerk by refusing to change the name, which he said was uncomfortable.\n\nI asked our son and he said he understands my side of not wanting to do this, but he understands Tony's side of being uncomfortable with his ex using his last name after the divorce.\n\n So I ask for an outside opinion. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
