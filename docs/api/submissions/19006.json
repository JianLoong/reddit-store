I thought the best thing to do would have been to keep it, use it for family reunions, have it available for some weeks a year for individual trips and renting it out the rest of the year and use the profits for the upkeep.

In my case, we (four kids) ALL took a large handful of stupid pills, and argued over stupid things, made stupid decision, etc\n\nYou sound like you were willing to only get a few possessions that meant something to you.\n\nI disagree with you about individuals getting either of the two properties.  You each have an equl share, and should be bought out.  No one gets the \"right\" to live is a property that is co-owned by the sibs.  \n\nYou left.  You saw yourself being left out of discussions or forced to make the decision as you other sibs couldn't come to an agreement.  Each of them wants to \"win.\" They have taken the stupid pills and are creating their own hills to die on.  The stupid pill either didn't take or wore off quickly.\n\nYou are NTA for leaving. The sibs are mad at you for not siding with them.  The extended family is mad at you because they don't get  why everyone is till arguing\n\nIn my case, within two years of my parents death, similar things happened.  I was only in tough with one of three sibs.  \n\nI know this isn't much help.  Your siblings have to come to an agreements about the properties.  If one sib desperately wants the property, they have the buy the rest of you.  Otherwise, sell them.", "NTA.", "NTA whatsoever.

Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nSide note: The fair thing is to get anything that wants to be kept appraised and the siblings that want those items \"buy\" them from the estate. \n\nThat is what we did with my grandmother's estate and it solved pretty much everything because there was a specific price attached to items and people could buy what was important/worth it to them.", "I don't want to make them do anything, they can figure that out for themselves.

The buying out thing is actually one of the easy solutions I mentioned in the post. But they don't want to do that, they say it would put a significant dent in their savings and then they have already made plans with the money they inherited. So far nobody has involved a lawyer officially (I'm sure they all had consultations to some degree). Because the two siblings who want to sell, could force that sale legally. For some reason they haven't so far. I just don't care. We have gotten so much already. I miss my parents (and the relationship I used to have with my siblings) and no money in the world will make that better.", "That would be the sane thing and I think at one point one of my siblings is going to lose patience and force a sale legally.

They just haven't done that so far. But I think it's coming.", "Is there anything stopping them from doing so? Like do all siblings have to agree on something to make it happen because there was no will? I'd also call them out on their behavior.

You should have one anyway with everything going on and what seems to be a significant amount of money. Since they are all being the AHs, I\u2019d tell the cousin to pound sand, and tell the lawyer to send notice to the siblings that you want one of two things. Either the properties are sold and split evenly among you all or the properties are assessed for their value, and those that want to keep it can buy the others off.", "NTA. You stated in a comment that you don\u2019t need any more money and therefore likely do not care if they keep or sell the properties. If possible hire a lawyer to stipulate this in writing to forfeit any state/claim you have on the properties. Send your siblings certified letters stating that you have forfeited your share of the properties and they can now bicker and feud all they want over simple material possessions but they have permanently lost a sibling, in addition to their parents, as a result. Please do explain how you feel and why, then block them and anyone else who calls you TA for deciding that your mental health is more important than money. \n\nYou are definitely not TA.

If one person wants it, they can buy it for Value- Their Share.", "ESH, you can't be neutral, nobody likes neutrality, pick a side.\n\n(Insert futurama meme here)\n\nWith the houses they get sold and if any single sibling wants to use it themselves that sibling buys out the other siblings, it really is that simple.", "NTA. Block them.

You can\u2019t voice out a choice or pick a side in any situation it seems. If you had voice out already about the house and sided with the rest against her or whichever way it was, your situation would have been solved.\n\nThe easier solution in all of this is to sell the houses and spilt the money cause everyone get their fair share.\n\nAnother solution is to get the houses valued and your siblings that want to stay there should pay you and the rest your shares.", "If the relationship is already burned -demand the sale and get the money.

Heck they probably should have eatablished a trust. I would say your parents are TA for poor financial planning in general.  All of this sibling infighting should have been avoided. I had my will made up in my late 20s and have updated it when I had kids or acquired new properties.  Basically anyone I know that has any real wealth does the same thing. Good lesson here to everyone else to get at least a simple will done.", "Thanks for responding.  I totally get that. My thought was that they will never leave you alone until who gets what is resolved.  That sucks. Good luck.  I hope you find peace and resolution", "Sounds like they're all equal owners of the properties so there needs to be mutual consent", "I don\u2019t even know. I mean, NTA I guess. But you did literally run away from your family\u2026 it\u2019s pretty out there to not mention moving\u2026 especially to a different country. I\u2019m sorry your parents left you in this situation. I believe anyone with the ability to leave assets including two homes has a duty to their heirs to leave a will. The fight between your siblings is so common in these cases. The homes should be sold. If a sibling/sibling group wants to keep a property they should buy out the other siblings. You should take this experience to heart and write your will now. Even if you don\u2019t have children it can include any future offspring and your favorite charities.", "Here is my solution, if anyone wants to live in either house, they need to buy the other siblings share out. If they don't then it can go on the market. NTA.", "NTA....sell both.  Get an attorney and cut any and all communication.  Any questions or concerns they have they can contact your attorney", "YTA....make a decision and stick with it. It's not fair for everyone to be in limbo for you", "Go NC with them and move on. All of them sound super toxic and useless.

They're just mad you won't take anyone's side for them.", "That would be sensible, since they already seem to be looking for someone to blame their mess on. It's totally understandable to me why you'd want to bow out of a situation like that. And I agree with those who've recommended getting a lawyer and having all contact go through the lawyer. Until your siblings can behave like reasonable adults, it's wise to keep some distance.", "Meh, even if they had a will it likely would have just listed the houses as part of the estate and then distributed said estate in percentages amongst the kids. The siblings would still be fighting over what to do with the houses they all inherited a percentage of.", "NTA.", "Sell it all and than split everything, than nobody can say the other got more.", "NTA. Definitely lawyer up & if those siblings want to own those houses, tell them to buy your share of the houses. Thats how my father and his family resolved ownership of my grandparent\u2019s house.", "NTA. But I cannot get over how irresponsible it was of your parents not to have a will in place with their level of assets and number of children. What were they thinking!", "NTA. Change your number honey.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t need to live locally to agree or disagree or simply say, \u201cyou all come to a decision and let me know what it is\u201d\n\nPersonally, for the parents home\u2026 since one sibling wants it, I would send email to all of them and say, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to live in that home.  I believe we should have it valued and then the sibling who wants it can buy out the rest of us\u201d. For the vacation home, you all can establish an LLC or land trust that you all own equal shares of.  Determine the weekly or monthly rent of the vacation home.  If a sibling wants to stay there, they pay market rent to the LLC that is responsible for covering maintenance costs, taxes, etc.  If no one is staying there, then it gets rented out to non-related vacationers.  At the end of the year, the profit is split among all of you, after all expenses have been paid and a set aside for taxes, insurance, utilities and repairs for the next year.", "You have a new home, new friends, and a new life. For the sake of your own sanity and well-being, go NC. If in the future you can finally tolerate it, then communicate with them but as far as I can see you don't need anything from them and they'll only give you more grief.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  I would definitely force the sale of the two homes or make them buy you out. Legally the taxes / insurance has to be paid, in theory split 5 ways and then there\u2019s maintenance/ upkeep / managing a rental. If you think it\u2019s dramatic now, just wait until there are year of one sibling living rent free in the main home and have claimed it, or the vacation home needing a new roof / siding / hvac / whatever. \n\nYou are the deciding vote. It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone thinks. I\u2019d get the estate lawyer involved. If you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d the money then sign away your rights to not have any legal / financial  encumbrances going forward but don\u2019t let this linger for months / years / decades. \n\nThink of a festering wound, treat it now or amputate later. You may not need the money now, but you might later, or a sibling might at some point and then everyone has to agree. \n\nIf sister wants to live in the house she buys everyone out. If four siblings want to keep holiday home for future, they buy you out. It\u2019s cleaner this way.", "My sister had everything handed to her in life by our parents. They helped her buy a house, paid for her wedding, bought her car, and gave her money constantly. Their excuse was because she had kids, she got pregnant at 16 and from then onwards she relied on them for support. \n\nWhen their money wasn\u2019t enough she forged her husband\u2019s signature and took out credit cards in her name and his, her husband\u2019s dad had to pay off 20,000 in debt. Did she learn? No! She got sacked from her job from stealing. \n\nI worked 60 hours a week doing night shifts from 18 and fully supported myself, I was so hard up sometimes I had to live off toast. If I ever asked my parents for money they didn\u2019t have it because it had gone to my sister. My dad inherited a lot of money after his parents died - she blew through it. \n\nMy dad had cancer and my sister helped out a lot with his care, I was still working full time and couldn\u2019t do as much as she could. She twisted everything and made it sound like I didn\u2019t care, my dad died believing this. \nFour years later my mum was also diagnosed with cancer, my sister was allowed paid time off from her job but again I had to work. My sister encouraged my mum to sell her house (our family home) and downsize so she had more money for her care. I found out later my sister spent it all whilst taking over my mums finances. \n\nMy mum and I were always close but my sister gaslighted her into believing I didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d delete my texts or send texts from my mums phone asking me not to come round. She convinced her that I wasn\u2019t doing enough because I was refused paid time off. I lived alone and would have lost my home with no income. \n\nLong story short my sister still tried to manipulate me and I thought we were reasonably close because I had no idea how much she was badmouthing me and she genuinely gaslighted both me and my mother into thinking she was a hero with her taking over caring for my mum. \nIt all came to a head 7 months after my mum was diagnosed when my sister told her at the end of November she had to choose between us where she spent Christmas. My mum told me she gave up and couldn\u2019t cope with the situation between us anymore, she died 2 days later and that was the last text I ever had.\n\nOur parents will was to split everything between us, but I found out later my mums house had \u00a370,000 of debt against it. I knew it was my sister and tried to prove it but I couldn\u2019t. \nShe sold all my mums furniture and kept most of our parents possessions and jewellery. She put my mums house on the market 3 weeks after she died, I was in such a haze of grief I couldn\u2019t get involved, the house was sold for a ridiculously low amount. The solicitor took my sisters side and let her empty the last of the money from my mums bank account- it was for the kids of course!\nWhen we got the rest of the money from the house sale my sister hounded me day and night for money, she was in so much debt she ended up with nothing. I literally had to leave the country and turn my phone off because she was calling me selfish and evil. \n\nIt took me a few months before the scales fell from my eyes, people throw about the word \u201cnarcissist\u201d but my sister actually has NPD, her husband told me. She is very popular and still has people under her spell - until they see through her. Her husband is very weak and goes along with anything she wants. \n\nI finally went NC and it was the best decision I ever made, I\u2019m not bitter about the money I\u2019d rather be independent and have the life skills, I\u2019m bitter about the relationships she destroyed. She alienated my mum from her friends and family when she was dying. \n\nI had some contact with my niece and nephew but as they got older I realised they were being told her version of events. My sister was diagnosed with cervical cancer and I sent her a text but made no other contact, she\u2019s beaten it now but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not changed, I haven\u2019t spoken to her in 3 years.  \n\nI chose my own family and have a best friend who is closer then any sister and a supportive partner. I\u2019m so grateful that they helped me see what was going on and encouraged me to cut ties. \n\nMoney can be evil and split families, I was the same as you and just wanted a peaceful life and I\u2019m happy with just having enough to survive. \nI read so many stories now on this forum and realise I\u2019m not alone, there are a lot of greedy people out there!\n\nSorry this is so long but I just wanted you to know you aren\u2019t alone in this. You are doing the right thing cutting ties and are NTA for looking after yourself when no one else is looking out for you. Let the money go and live your life.", "He totally can be neutral. In fact, he stayed neutral. Obviously, you can\u2019t always be neutral, but sometimes, being neutral is the best way to be about certain matters. This is one of those matters.", "Stop talking to them and hire a lawyer. Let lawyer handle it. \n\nJust be honest with them. Their actions were messed up and you can't handle it. They acted like spoiled children and you're not putting up with it. You're leaving the country to get better, and you'll talk after the estate is handled. The lawyer will handle your interests. Tell lawyer to be fair, not doormat but not shark. In emergency, they let lawyer know and lawyer talks to you. \n\nJust dodging the situation won't make it better, especially if you're only doing so half heartedly by letting them harass you. But making it clear you're not playing their games, and leaving a responsible adult to get paid to take a beating in your place, you're good. It'll be handled, lawyer can do what's needed and you can talk to them on good terms after this was settled.\n\nShould have gone this route the second things exploded. Less hurt feelings. Sometimes trying to achieve peace at all costs is the worst way to handle a situation. This is one of those times.", "I said NTA, but when you put it this way I\u2019m on the fence. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the asshole for not wanting to deal with the drama, or removing yourself from the situation, but you are tied to this estate and decision. Don\u2019t leave it unresolved. Hire a lawyer, find out your rights, and either relinquish your rights to the property, (not recommended), or have the lawyer let them know you want your portion of those properties and your siblings can figure it out. \n\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Honestly, grief is sneaky and brutal. I hope you are able to get some counseling, both for the loss of your parents and the family drama. Both my parents are dead, decades apart, one from cancer the other old age. Even though we knew it was happening it was still a shock when they died. I can\u2019t even fathom such an unwelcome surprise as a tragic accident. As our dad was declining I fought for an equal split of his small estate between my brother and I. Brother did everything he could to make things favorable to him. This was not a surprise. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if it wasn\u2019t equal, he thought somehow he deserved more than half despite having \u201cborrowed\u201d thousands from dad he never paid back, and having to be guilted into helping dad in hospice. I am not the \u201cbetter\u201d person, I just have my own ethics I run my life by. After speaking with a therapist she assured me it was not wrong to have boundaries. Seriously, get a therapist and a lawyer. It\u2019s ok to distance yourself from family, but not with all the legalities in play. And please don\u2019t forfeit your inheritance, put it all in a retirement account, or donate in your parent\u2019s names, start a foundation to help the underprivileged, anything but leaving it to greedy siblings.", "You don't want to be involved but you are involved. Get a lawyer & let the lawyer handle this for you. You might not want/need the money now but you don't know what may be needed in the future. As I see it the houses can be sold & profits split equally or the people who want the homes can buy the others out. A lawyer will be able to handle this for you.", "Agree that this would be the sanest thing. And the siblings that want to live in the houses can buy the shares from the others. \n\nI understand that the whole thing is unbelievably traumatic as you're not only grieving the loss of your parents, you're grieving the loss of your entire family as it was, including your relationship with your siblings. But the sooner it gets resolved the sooner everyone can move on from this episode, and the less dragged out this will be.\n\nRepresenting 1/5 of the estate, I get the feeling that legally nothing can happen without OP's input, which is why everyone is mad. Since it's 2v2, you ARE the deciding vote so it's best that you cast it just so all of you can move on. Let them know that you're sick of the infighting, you just miss your family, and you want to be left alone to take time to grieve.\n\nYou could also suggest a family therapist or professional family mediator, as y'all sound like you need it. I agree that your siblings sound like they're acting like asses over money, but no doubt they all are dealing with the same trauma and might be lashing out because of it.", "Hurt and anger are causing OP to retaliate with petulant  \"quiet quitting,\" insisting they have to figure it out and he will not have contact about the matter.\n\nOP, hire the attorney to communicate on your behalf and quit punishing yourself on top of your siblings - wrap this up.", "Not necessarily. They can go to court to (potentially) compel the sale. It\u2019s called a partition action. Laws vary by state and the particulars of the ownership situation, but it\u2019s regarded as such an expensive pain in the ass for all involved that the mere threat of one might be sufficient."]}
