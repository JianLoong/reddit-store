My beloved parents died in an accident and I'm still grieving. My siblings (36F, 30M, 29M, 25F) have been no help at all.\n\nMy parents were quite wealthy and that is were the problems started. They didn't leave a will, so everything was to be devided equally between us siblings. \n\nThis was easy for most assets, they were liquidated and the proceeds were added to the money they left us and split between us. Now we all would be more than comfortable for the rest of our lives, although not as wealthy as our parents had been. \n\nThings went sour when we met at their house to deal with their belongings and decide what to do with their house and their holiday home.\nMy siblings started to fight about everything. You name it, they fought about it. Jewelry, china, furniture, books, toys, collectibles, rugs, paintings, frames, tools etc. It was pathetic. It made me check out and only claim a few things of sentimental value to me. I would have liked to take some of the books, but it wasn't worth getting into the fight. \n\nShit hit the fan when it came to the house itself. None of my siblings live in the town where the house is located, but apparently my sister (36F) wants to move there in the foreseeable future and live in the house and expected to be everyone to be fine that.\nI don't have a problem with that. But two of my siblings (30M, 25F) were hellbent on selling and splitting the money. I would have been okay with that, if that as well, if this had been the wish of all of my four siblings.\nIt got even worse when it came to the holiday home. I thought the best thing to do would have been to keep it, use it for family reunions, have it available for some weeks a year for individual trips and renting it out the rest of the year and use the profits for the upkeep. I never even got to propose that plan. 29M wants to live there partially (works from home almost 100%). Another big fight ensued.\n\nThere are basically two sides (36F and 29M against 30M and 25F). To this day the issues are not resolved and I refused to pick a side, which made everyone angry.\n\nThey basically all stopped talking to me.\n\nThis and my new financial situation gave me a push to burn down all bridges and move to a different country to start a new life. My siblings didn't even notice. I found a new job, slowly made some friends and started to feel like I was adjusting to the fact, that my parents weren't there anymore.\n\nWell my siblings finally found out (there was a new round of arguments about the house and they wanted to rope me in). Now they are united for the first time in over a year. They think I'm the AH for just leaving and are taking turns berating me. But I just don't have the mental capacity to deal with their bullshit. There are a couple of easy solutions to the problems l, they are just too stubborn.\n\nToday one of our cousins called me and said I was the AH.\n\nSo am I really?", "created_utc": 1685930191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140yfq4/aita_for_moving_out_of_the_country_without/", "score": 220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That takes work.", "NTA. You're an adult and can do as you like.  Obviously when they wanted to get in touch with you, they were able to do so.\n\nIt seems they want you to be the swing vote as until now it has been 2 against 2; your vote can be the deciding factor. You need to do what is best for you. However horrible your relatives are, you have to work your way through this.  Do what is easiest for you and then *get the heck away* from those folks.", "NTA simple, block them all.", "NTA. I wouldn't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with them either.\n\nIMO, the sane thing to do is to sell+split everything unless there is unanimous consensus on what otherwise to do with an item.", "NTA... and good job on uniting them.", "You were mature and apparently the only one with sentimental feelings towards your parents. Your siblings behaved like vultures.  \n\nMy condolences, and I hope you find peace. You also owe them zero info on decisions you make as an adult. \n\nNTA", "NTA- but depending on where you are, I believe an \u201cheir\u201d can force a sale to get liquidated assets.", "It's never an A H move to sever ties from toxic people. Take care of your mental health, let them continue fighting over the estate without you. It says a lot that it took them so long to even realize you were gone - you can see what their focus was on, and it wasn't good family relationships.\n\nNTA.", "I don't think this is about your moving, I think this about dividing an estate.\n\nDividing an estate when the parents are gone is incredibly hard.  In my case, we (four kids) ALL took a large handful of stupid pills, and argued over stupid things, made stupid decision, etc\n\nYou sound like you were willing to only get a few possessions that meant something to you.\n\nI disagree with you about individuals getting either of the two properties.  You each have an equl share, and should be bought out.  No one gets the \"right\" to live is a property that is co-owned by the sibs.  \n\nYou left.  You saw yourself being left out of discussions or forced to make the decision as you other sibs couldn't come to an agreement.  Each of them wants to \"win.\" They have taken the stupid pills and are creating their own hills to die on.  The stupid pill either didn't take or wore off quickly.\n\nYou are NTA for leaving. The sibs are mad at you for not siding with them.  The extended family is mad at you because they don't get  why everyone is till arguing\n\nIn my case, within two years of my parents death, similar things happened.  I was only in tough with one of three sibs.  \n\nI know this isn't much help.  Your siblings have to come to an agreements about the properties.  If one sib desperately wants the property, they have the buy the rest of you.  Otherwise, sell them.", "NTA.", "NTA whatsoever. I\u2019m so sorry about your parents, and that your siblings compounded your grief by being so awful. \n\nGood for you for choosing your own wellbeing and getting the heck out of there. You can now build a chosen family of your own. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nSide note: The fair thing is to get anything that wants to be kept appraised and the siblings that want those items \"buy\" them from the estate. \n\nThat is what we did with my grandmother's estate and it solved pretty much everything because there was a specific price attached to items and people could buy what was important/worth it to them.", "I don't want to make them do anything, they can figure that out for themselves. I don't need any more money. And I doubt I'll ever have a loving relationship with them again, this whole thing jus has been too traumatic.", "It wouldn't really matter, what my vote is. One of the ones wanting to sell could force that now. They just haven't so far.\n\nMy cousin doesn't know much, just that there's been a lot of fighting, especially about the houses. They just think it was an AH move to leave the country and check out of this unresolved problem.", "Thanks.\nYeah life is pretty great so far, I just hope it stays this way. The buying out thing is actually one of the easy solutions I mentioned in the post. But they don't want to do that, they say it would put a significant dent in their savings and then they have already made plans with the money they inherited. So far nobody has involved a lawyer officially (I'm sure they all had consultations to some degree). Because the two siblings who want to sell, could force that sale legally. For some reason they haven't so far. I just don't care. We have gotten so much already. I miss my parents (and the relationship I used to have with my siblings) and no money in the world will make that better.", "That would be the sane thing and I think at one point one of my siblings is going to lose patience and force a sale legally. But I just don't want to be involved.", "Haha, let's see how long that lasts.", "Thank you. It has been truly baffling what kind of effect the money has had on my siblings, especially since there is more than enough of it for everyone.", "Yes, the two that want to sell could easily force a sale. They just haven't done that so far. But I think it's coming.", "Is there anything stopping them from doing so? Like do all siblings have to agree on something to make it happen because there was no will? I'd also call them out on their behavior. Have a zoom meeting if you can handle it and call them on their bs. May not amount to much but you would have put your cards on the table and told them to leave you out of it....NTA", "Then there is no point for you or your cousins to drag you back by the time the 4 gold colectors settle you might has well found yourself a new found family. \n\nBetting it will take them months or a year before they come to an agreement", "I would get a lawyer and tell your siblings all contact goes to the lawyer. You should have one anyway with everything going on and what seems to be a significant amount of money. Since they are all being the AHs, I\u2019d tell the cousin to pound sand, and tell the lawyer to send notice to the siblings that you want one of two things. Either the properties are sold and split evenly among you all or the properties are assessed for their value, and those that want to keep it can buy the others off.", "NTA. You stated in a comment that you don\u2019t need any more money and therefore likely do not care if they keep or sell the properties. If possible hire a lawyer to stipulate this in writing to forfeit any state/claim you have on the properties. Send your siblings certified letters stating that you have forfeited your share of the properties and they can now bicker and feud all they want over simple material possessions but they have permanently lost a sibling, in addition to their parents, as a result. Please do explain how you feel and why, then block them and anyone else who calls you TA for deciding that your mental health is more important than money. \n\nYou are definitely not TA. It would seem that either your siblings are incredibly toxic or have become stuck in the anger phase of grief. Either way save yourself.", "**NTA** and my condolences on the loss of your parents.", "It will cost a bit but have all official contact govthrough an attorney", "NTA\n\nTake care of yourself. You sound like a well-adjusted human. I hope your new life goes well. Maybe someday they will mature and come around. Until then? Heal.", "NTA\n\nMy condolences for the loss of your parents. I\u2019m so sorry your siblings are causing all this drama while you\u2019re trying to grieve. \n\nMoney brings out the worst in people, and your siblings\u2019 squabbling at a time like this is despicable. I\u2019m proud of you for valuing what really matters, and for finding the strength to rebuild your life. You are absolutely NTA.", "Nta \u2026. But you are going to have to make them sell everything and split the money or one buy the others out of the properties that is the only fair thing and honestly probably the best thing for your MH right now", "NTA but you if you want them to stop bickering and actually still have a family I'd recommend engaging. Get them on zoom and Tell them you won't be the scape goat for them. Either the one that wants the main house buys everyone out or you guys sell it and split it \n\nSame with the holiday home or suggest your renting idea again \n\nBut this will only become a bigger problem if you don't engage \n\nFair enough you think you don't need the money but you don't know what's around the corner.", "Make them buy you out! You still deserve your share.", "This is excellent advice. This gives you an emotional buffer from the fracas, and it can speed up finally setting the estate.  I'm terribly sorry for your losses.", "NTA\n\nI am so so sorry about the death of your parents. 33 is still quite young to lose a parent, and that is coming from someone who lost a parent at the age of 10. To lose both of the same time is devastating.\n\n\nYou do what you need- to hell with them.", "NTA.   \nIf you have the deciding vote, sell the houses, and get your money.", "NTA guess what as an adult you don\u2019t have to clear your life with anyone. Your siblings turned into toxic greedy monsters and you want no part. I say good for you! Enjoy your new home life and friends!", "You\u2019d have to check the laws for your area on what happens with the houses. Where I live, if a house is owned by more than one party and anyone wants to sell, the other parties must buy them out or the house goes on sale and profits are split. \n\nSorry for your loss OP \n\nNTA", ">Make them sell both houses\n\nThis is exactly what should have happened if there are people who can't agree. If anyone wants to live in a house then they can buy the others out. The OP keeping quiet about their wishes and not even speaking up about those books is why they're got walked over.", "Don\u2019t leave money on the table. You never know what can happen", "Then get a lawyer and have all communication go through them, but you can't just bury your head in the sand. Decisions do need to be made here."]}
