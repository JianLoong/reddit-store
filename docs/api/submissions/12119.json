So she quit. She now says she can\u2019t work because she doesn\u2019t want to quit when June 12 comes around and the kids are out of school. \n\nShe says she will work from home if I find her a job. I tried to get a second job but she blew up saying I don\u2019t do enough at home. She told me things will be better when I make more money.", "Yeah my mom did this too. Summers off with us and all holidays. It was nice. Although, a lot of places don't pay over the summer anymore.", "She's probably terrified of getting back out there after 16 years if not being able to build a career. I was out for four years as a SAHM and I had to abandon my previous career as a journalist. Things had moved on too much, I was out of the network. So I chose education to fit around school. Not a career path I had envisaged, workimg with more kids, but that's what I had to do. SAHPs are treated like dirt by society and often their partners.", "Being a stay at home doesn't fix the brakes though or pay the bills. Kids are old enough to watch themselves.", "As one person who suggested that she look for some form of work - such as housekeeping - I would like to say that, when I was in a pinch, I worked as a housecleaner. If we needed safe brakes on a car that my children rode in, I would do it again.\n\nHaving said that, I agree that the OP does seem to 'dump' on his wife. Not enough information was provided on how they got to this point of not having enough money for brakes. Does he hold a low-paying job? Is someone living beyond their means? All of these factors would need to be known to understand where to lay blame. I just don't see this as the in-law's problem.", "No one makes minimum wage these days. The wife could get a part time job at a fast food place making $16/hr tomorrow. The lady who cleans our house charges per cleaning but it equates to around $50/hr; it\u2019s actually a fantastic way to make money and control your own schedule.", "This comment by OP shows she had a job until recently:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pfw0z/aita_for_asking_my_inlaws_to_help_pay_toward_my/jbxpq3j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "The older ones didn\u2019t pop out babies it\u2019s not a child\u2019s responsibility to take care of their siblings.", "This. Why is \u201che\u201d required to work 2 paying jobs?  I know something is missing from the post. Perhaps some disable child? Or some one wrote a check once and more was planned?", "Agreed. I've got to admit, she sounds lazy. OP responded to someone else saying he got a second job, but that wifey was not happy that he was not doing enough at home. There is work available if you are willing to do work that is not fun. She needs to get over herself", "Wife is not disabled. She cleans and gets the kids on and off bus. She worked for a few months and quit. As for money my in-laws are constantly offering it if we need it since their daughter stays home.\nThey pay for her other sister when she stayed home with her kids until they were 12; even paid for a vacation cruise. My parents offered money directly, and my wife blew up saying I don\u2019t want them controlling my life. Her parents literally write a check to my wife\u2019s other sister with no kids so they don\u2019t have to worry about basic bills.  \n\nMy wife will say you need to make more money and then when I apply for a second job makes it clear I need to be home more.", "Have her check indeed or snagajob.

Your a part time parent. bravo do you want a cookie?", "My parents generation thought the same way they called them lock key kids. What do u think happened?", "[deleted]", "NTA for asking them since they\u2019ve been offering. Based on your comments it sounds like she is just comfortable not working. I don\u2019t think the focus should be on you making more money when she is capable of working and applying for wfh positions herself.", "Wow sorry u married such a lazy woman. I mean even if she worked 20 hours a week just to pay for a few extra things that pop up from time to time. She\u2019s really entitled", "You two need to sit down and formulate a plan. You expected to take a 20% decrease in pay and not feel it somewhere? Impossible. When you say you got a \"new car\" do you mean it was brand new or new to you?\n\nYou need to evaluate whether you can stay in your home or downsize. Do you have more than one car? One of the cars would need to go. Yes, you have three children, but carpooling arrangements and Uber is cheaper than a second car. Do you eat out at lunch time? Pack a lunch. \n\nBeing angry with her on reddit won't help you. Both of you need to make sacrifices.", "> She told me things will be better when I make more money.\n\nShe sounds selfish. AWWW last job wasn't fufilling, suck it up buttercup and deal with life. I did not enjoy the 3 part time jobs I had raising our son... but ADULTS do what needs to be done. Tell her to get off her silk pillow and earn some $$$. BTW SAHM does not need to do much raising teens ( unless she really slacked when they were younger)", "I get it- I\u2019m a SPED teacher myself, and some days it empties my cup more than it fills. BUT there are so many other jobs out there, including temp work, that won\u2019t leave her employer \u201cscrambling\u201d for a replacement when June arrives. I waited tables for years- super easy to just get the lunch shift, so she can be home when the kids are done with work.", "Also, it depends on whether there really IS a back. I had no real job experience, couldn\u2019t make enough to cover transport and child care, stayed home. If I went back after 16 years I\u2019d have been in my 30s with NO work experience\u2026 not really a situation that jobs with good potential income are looking to higher from. \n\nReally, her best bet would be upgrading her education.", ">She's probably terrified of getting back out there after 16 years if not being able to build a career\n\nI totally understand that. My mother was a SAHM and from a successful academic she turned into an utterly unhappy person, treated condescendingly by everyone around. She never managed to come back to the job market.", "OP\u2019s comment makes it sound like she was working a job in the schools, but no longer wants to:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pfw0z/aita_for_asking_my_inlaws_to_help_pay_toward_my/jbxpq3j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", ">Being a stay at home doesn't fix the brakes though or pay the bills.\n\nBut thanks to it no money need to be spent on childcare.

Especially with no previous experience?", "They can care for themselves cant they? \n\nI know Reddit is always very upset when parents ask their children to help care for their siblings but those are the realities parents all over the world have to deal with. Also, those kids will be home for the most part anyways during the summer so they would basically just be hanging out with their sibling during the day, or doing their own thing. The older kids would just be the one to make the call in case of an emergency. The kid \u201cin charge\u201d is not required to discipline their sibling and they\u2019re all old enough to heat up their own meals in the microwave or grab a snack if they\u2019re hungry", "OP responded to a comment elsewhere that she was working at a school but recently quit:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pfw0z/aita_for_asking_my_inlaws_to_help_pay_toward_my/jbxpq3j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "She should look into something from home or medical transcription or something like that.

It sounds like her parents are happy to do it. What are the strings that it comes with? Yes, there are always some strings. Some more or less onerous than others. \n\nIf they feel that they can judge or criticize her for her personal choices, then that can be hard to swallow. You shouldn't get another job imo, but she needs to pick up something PT at least. WFH, gardening center, etc. If that sounds like too much, then she will just have to buy some earplugs so as not to hear her parents.", "Your wife sounds like shes been coddled all her life and feels entitled to whatever she wants. She can\u2019t even drive your kids to school? So she cleans and cooks and only has to parent after school is done?
