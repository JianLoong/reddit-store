This is important for context, my partner and I live together. My best friend and I have known each other for years now. We are close, but I feel she crossed a limit.

They are still living with their parents, so they haven\u2019t been able to find a time to be sexually intimate. She asked me if she could use our bed to have sex, and leave after that. I told her no, because we only have one bed that is owned by my partner and I. And even if we had another one, it was our home, and it was our sacred space.
