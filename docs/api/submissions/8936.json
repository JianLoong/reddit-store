Otherwise why would he be taking it out on them? \n\nNTA - The fact that you didn't feel comfortable enough to speak to your father about the tattoos should have been enough evidence that you are NTA here.\n\nIts tattoos, I don't understand his hatred against them considering it is possible to remove them in most cases.", "NTA. Your father is extremely controlling which you know. Note that your brother and mother didnt ask about you, the call was for themselves- they ONLY want the heat off them which is very alarming that they would be blamed or punished by your choices. Abusive. You know not to go home. You and your father have different philosophies. No idea if this is cultural or not, but if it is, sounds like you have accepted he is set in his ways. Hopefully, this blowup just needed to happen, but boy, he is mad that you are not under his thumb. Watch that cousin- that person is 100% trouble- people are estranged for a reason. Shut down all family access to your social media.", "So they want you to stay at home and be verbally/emotionally abused so that they won\u2019t be? \n\nGiven that not only are they adults but you even offered them a safe place - definitely NTA.

Your dad sounds like he causes fear in everyone in the house, and that is no way to live,", "You father seems to have a lot of issues that have nothing to do with those tattoos since he's being abusive to your brother and mom. You get to live your life in peace by moving out.", "NTA your father is a jerk and 22 is high time to move out anyway.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry he\u2019s acting like this. \n\nI feel you, I hid my tattoos with stage makeup (waterproof, even! We went to the beach a lot!) for almost a decade. A *decade*, lol. \n\nMy dad only found out when I was in a music video and he saw my leg/thigh tattoo. It was\u2026 uncomfortable for a while, mainly because of the shock of like, I was *hiding* something for that long. It made him upset about that, more than anything. It was kindof a rug pull moment: i am covered in tattoos lol, and I\u2019d been hiding them for so long that it was like, a shock. And we have a close relationship so it made him kindof upset about that factor. \n\nSomething that helped my dad, maybe this will help yours too? Is that I explained that tattoos are art, and it\u2019s putting art on your body. And I also explained the reason I hid them was for respect, because I knew he didn\u2019t approve of them and I didn\u2019t want to cause any undue stress. So I went the extra mile to keep the peace for that long. And, I apologized for hiding them. But that discussion made my dad realize kindof like, \u201coh. It\u2019s a little silly to be soooo against tattoos that his kid is putting on theater-grade makeup to hide it.\u201d And he got over it. He still occasionally makes some mild jokes about the tattoos, but it\u2019s in good humor now; he just asks me what I\u2019m gonna do when I run out of room for new ones. \ud83d\ude39 in response now, I ask him when he\u2019s gonna get his first tattoo. Still no luck but you never know! \n\nThe older generation grew up hearing tattoos are for prisoners and sailors, they don\u2019t always \u201cget it\u201d and sometimes explaining can help \ud83d\ude05 and part of why your dad is being distant could also just be, he feels like it\u2019s a sign you don\u2019t trust him. So I would also suggest, even tho you didn\u2019t really do anything wrong, have a honest discussion with your dad and just try and explain your side of things. Maybe apologize for hiding it, and tell him you\u2019re glad things are out in the open now. Frame it as a positive thing! Now he knows you\u2019re creative, and artsy, and have some cool art on your body. It may take a while but I\u2019m sure your relationship will get better again.
