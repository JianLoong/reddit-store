Your father is extremely controlling which you know. Note that your brother and mother didnt ask about you, the call was for themselves- they ONLY want the heat off them which is very alarming that they would be blamed or punished by your choices. Abusive. You know not to go home. You and your father have different philosophies. No idea if this is cultural or not, but if it is, sounds like you have accepted he is set in his ways. Hopefully, this blowup just needed to happen, but boy, he is mad that you are not under his thumb. Watch that cousin- that person is 100% trouble- people are estranged for a reason. Shut down all family access to your social media.", "So they want you to stay at home and be verbally/emotionally abused so that they won\u2019t be? \n\nGiven that not only are they adults but you even offered them a safe place - definitely NTA.

We went to the beach a lot!) for almost a decade. A *decade*, lol. \n\nMy dad only found out when I was in a music video and he saw my leg/thigh tattoo. It was\u2026 uncomfortable for a while, mainly because of the shock of like, I was *hiding* something for that long. It made him upset about that, more than anything. It was kindof a rug pull moment: i am covered in tattoos lol, and I\u2019d been hiding them for so long that it was like, a shock. And we have a close relationship so it made him kindof upset about that factor. \n\nSomething that helped my dad, maybe this will help yours too? Is that I explained that tattoos are art, and it\u2019s putting art on your body. And I also explained the reason I hid them was for respect, because I knew he didn\u2019t approve of them and I didn\u2019t want to cause any undue stress. So I went the extra mile to keep the peace for that long. And, I apologized for hiding them. But that discussion made my dad realize kindof like, \u201coh. It\u2019s a little silly to be soooo against tattoos that his kid is putting on theater-grade makeup to hide it.\u201d And he got over it. He still occasionally makes some mild jokes about the tattoos, but it\u2019s in good humor now; he just asks me what I\u2019m gonna do when I run out of room for new ones. \ud83d\ude39 in response now, I ask him when he\u2019s gonna get his first tattoo. Still no luck but you never know! \n\nThe older generation grew up hearing tattoos are for prisoners and sailors, they don\u2019t always \u201cget it\u201d and sometimes explaining can help \ud83d\ude05 and part of why your dad is being distant could also just be, he feels like it\u2019s a sign you don\u2019t trust him. So I would also suggest, even tho you didn\u2019t really do anything wrong, have a honest discussion with your dad and just try and explain your side of things. Maybe apologize for hiding it, and tell him you\u2019re glad things are out in the open now. Frame it as a positive thing! Now he knows you\u2019re creative, and artsy, and have some cool art on your body. It may take a while but I\u2019m sure your relationship will get better again.

Eventually I decided to say fuck it and invite her to the tattoo appointment for the piece I was getting for her.

Hopefully your brother and mom can learn to not only respect your boundaries but appreciate that you did something for your own well being.

If forced to guess, he has a history of abuse towards you and the rest of the family; if it hadn't been tattoos, it would have been something else.  \n\nUnquestionably NTA.  Your brother and mother are adults; they can decide how they want to respond to your ogre of a father.", "It's worth reflecting on why you feel this unfounded sense of guilt.\n\nWhat, exactly, do you feel guilty for?\n\nYou have bodily autonomy. You did nothing wrong by getting tattoos. You did nothing wrong by wearing long sleeves so that he didn't see them. You have done nothing wrong by moving out to ensure your own safety.\n\nYou are not responsible to or for your parents and brother.", "I don't feel bad for getting tattoos, I feel bad for abandoning my mother and brother in the situation that is all.", "my mom is exactly like this. i\u2019m now 20. i stopped living w her foe years in high school. when i turned 18 i got a tattoo from my armpit to my hip. i had her blocked on instagram but she stalked me they fake accounts. over the summer of 2020 i took a bunch of pictures in swimsuits. after one huge fight, i posted one with the caption \u201cthis will be how my mom finds out i got a tattoo\u201d. to put it nicely, she went ducking ballistic. couldn\u2019t do shit abt it tho\u263a\ufe0f", "Yup. Many dysfunctional families organize themselves around tiptoeing around the feelings of the most dysfunctional and/or explosive one, which sounds like it's your father in your case. NTA for sure", "Well basically they are saying \"come to the dark side, we have abuse\". You are never an ah for saying no to that.\n\nYour father is abusive and you have been putting up with it for too long. I seriously doubt this was the only one thing where you had to walk on eggs shells.\n\nNTA.", "I really like that analogy.  The boat-steadying is so insidious though, slowly it becomes a learned, unconscious behaviour.  Eventually the boat-rocker becomes the center of everyone's life, manipulating others rather than face their own issues.", "And/or the boat-steadiers get recognized for their outstanding achievements in boat-steadying. It sounds like praise. \"Wow, you're so calm all the time! I don't know anyone who seems so peaceful!\" It sounds like envy. \"I wish I could be an anchor for someone the way you are for [them].\" It sounds like something to be proud of. \"You're [their] still waters. In the midst of [their] storm, here you are keeping [them] from being swept out to sea.\" \n\nUntil you realize that it's all justification for [them] to never stop rocking the boat. I don't want to be peaceful *all the time.* The anchor never gets to do its own thing, always being raised or lowered at the whims of the boat. Maybe sometimes, *I* want to be the storm.", "Well, then he's making a choice to put up with your father for the sake of his goal. That doesn't place the onus on you to accommodate him. Your father sounds emotionally abusive.", "Expecting you to be emotionally abused so that he doesn't have to pay for an apartment is awful. NTA", "I hear you.  Maybe become your own hurricane for a day just for the lols and watch everyone scramble.  Although when that happens in reality the boat-steadier becomes TA in everyone's eyes.  You can't win except to exit the dynamic entirely.", "There's no punishment for you to have to take. You haven't done anything wrong.", "Sounds like you already know you made the right decision.  Some parents never accept that their children grow up and get to make their own decisions based on their own philosophy and values.\n\nReminds of a family I grew up with, the parents were raging conservatives who are very much anti tattoos and constantly make pointed remarks about how their younger daughter's tattoos are so repulsive.  It's so weird to care that much about other people's choices over their own style and bodily autonomy.", "Things are bad already.\n\nHe's not there solely because of his savings goal: if he were, he would move out with you, it's just as effective and he would be out from under.", ">he's the parent and I'm the \"child\" \n\nWhen you were actually a child, your parents had responsibility for your actions, and you were expected to obey, within reason.\n\nYou are no longer a child. You are no longer responsible to your parents. You owe them no deference.", "He is. He doesn't want to live under a roof that I am paying for. He wants to save so he can buy a house for himself. Living there is one way to do it, sorry but it's true on his end", "Yes you are 22 and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s such a breath of fresh air to have your own space and do what you want with your body. His view is outdated and too intense imo. Get out and enjoy your life. Reddit releases you and the world embraces you"]}
