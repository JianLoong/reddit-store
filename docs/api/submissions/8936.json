Your father is extremely controlling which you know. Note that your brother and mother didnt ask about you, the call was for themselves- they ONLY want the heat off them which is very alarming that they would be blamed or punished by your choices. Abusive. You know not to go home. You and your father have different philosophies. No idea if this is cultural or not, but if it is, sounds like you have accepted he is set in his ways. Hopefully, this blowup just needed to happen, but boy, he is mad that you are not under his thumb. Watch that cousin- that person is 100% trouble- people are estranged for a reason. Shut down all family access to your social media.", "So they want you to stay at home and be verbally/emotionally abused so that they won\u2019t be? \n\nGiven that not only are they adults but you even offered them a safe place - definitely NTA.

We went to the beach a lot!) for almost a decade. A *decade*, lol. \n\nMy dad only found out when I was in a music video and he saw my leg/thigh tattoo. It was\u2026 uncomfortable for a while, mainly because of the shock of like, I was *hiding* something for that long. It made him upset about that, more than anything. It was kindof a rug pull moment: i am covered in tattoos lol, and I\u2019d been hiding them for so long that it was like, a shock. And we have a close relationship so it made him kindof upset about that factor. \n\nSomething that helped my dad, maybe this will help yours too? Is that I explained that tattoos are art, and it\u2019s putting art on your body. And I also explained the reason I hid them was for respect, because I knew he didn\u2019t approve of them and I didn\u2019t want to cause any undue stress. So I went the extra mile to keep the peace for that long. And, I apologized for hiding them. But that discussion made my dad realize kindof like, \u201coh. It\u2019s a little silly to be soooo against tattoos that his kid is putting on theater-grade makeup to hide it.\u201d And he got over it. He still occasionally makes some mild jokes about the tattoos, but it\u2019s in good humor now; he just asks me what I\u2019m gonna do when I run out of room for new ones. \ud83d\ude39 in response now, I ask him when he\u2019s gonna get his first tattoo. Still no luck but you never know! \n\nThe older generation grew up hearing tattoos are for prisoners and sailors, they don\u2019t always \u201cget it\u201d and sometimes explaining can help \ud83d\ude05 and part of why your dad is being distant could also just be, he feels like it\u2019s a sign you don\u2019t trust him. So I would also suggest, even tho you didn\u2019t really do anything wrong, have a honest discussion with your dad and just try and explain your side of things. Maybe apologize for hiding it, and tell him you\u2019re glad things are out in the open now. Frame it as a positive thing! Now he knows you\u2019re creative, and artsy, and have some cool art on your body. It may take a while but I\u2019m sure your relationship will get better again.

My mother and my father do argue a lot but they have always worked it out, but I feel like this is different.", "He can have his opinion, but it has definitely become an issue with everyone.", "Sometimes I do feel bad for abandoning them because they are also the emotional abuse punching bag as well and now all focus is on them...I do think their approach wasn't right.", "Thank you, I didn't want to have to make a decision like this but evidently it was the only choice I could make instead of being in a house with someone who could snap at any moment.", "I don't blame my mother and brother for thinking the way they do because they are fearful of my father, but I agree that they need to start reflecting on the situation and make some decisions for themselves..", "I was planning on moving out anyways, and they knew about it as well, I moved out earlier than expected, even if this didn't happen I was going to do it anyways.", "It is our...How can I say it? Family politics? My mother has always been the person protecting us, but I feel like this situation is the turning point and everything is exploding and blowing up, I don't think she means to \"throw me to the wolves\" but it is what she's doing.", "I agree.", "It's true. They're in a cycle where when things do get to an extremely heated point they even have the thought of leaving but they never have. It's an overall difficult situation.", "Thank you, I would never want to leave them there that's why I offered the space to them until he's cooled off.", "Yeah pretty much.", "It's unfortunate but my father is definitely not someone that would have that approach. I wish thought.", "Remind your father and mother that having a relationship with their children is a privledge, not a right. \nStop hiding who you are from your father. If he doesn't like it, remind him you don't have to come around if he can't be pleasant.", "My dad doesn't treat them any better even if I was around. I will defend my mother and say she has tried her best to defend us as much as she can but my dad has shot her down several times and I think it's taken a toll on her.", "I know, I still have some guilt that comes up though..", "It was to please him, not my brother and mother, they did have an inkling that I had tattoos I just never showed them.", "We were all pretty much getting the brunt of his wrath to be honest, it was...Even? He is just super rage-filled. It's not a red flag, I think it's how it's just always been.", "My cousin has built up resentment towards my father and I, and this was his way of getting back at us, which evidently he succeeded.", "I don't think I was a scapegoat, I think they say \"worse on them\" because now all his rage is directed towards them instead of me (the person who caused the rage.). I have guilt for leaving but I have realized that I wouldn't be able to live happily at all if I continued to stay.", "I don't, that's why I had planned on leaving in April because of how anxious I was becoming about him possibly finding out and exploding.", "I tried to tell my dad when I got my first one but he was never able to be approached to sit and have a rational conversation.", "Four summers worth of long sleeves, like I said I knew what I was getting myself into when I got them in the first place, and I signed up to hide them until I decided to tell him. When my cousin told him I was furious. I feel like the distance might help him cope a little bit, it's better than seeing me everyday and being reminded.", "I feel like giving that space for him to just let everything out would be more ideal than him having to see me everyday and being reminded of it.", "He has always been rage-filled and sometimes he does snap at really really small things, when they say he's being worse towards them he's probably being extremely angry and is expressing it in many ways.", "He is emotionally abusive and he physically intimidates us (he has never raised a hand to us but he has gotten in our faces when he's yelled etc.). Any time I would bring up the topic of tattoos it would be met with venomous hate, and he would really go in on that point of guilt-tripping me into not getting them.", "He is estranged for a reason, a very bad reason that actually includes me and my father. He did it to get back at me, and in turn, get back at him. My mother and brother did ask about me though very briefly.", "He was raised as a conservative Italian, it still might be the 1930's in his head honestly, I have no clue...But I know I made a better decision moving out than staying in a place where anything I am interested in isn't accepted...", "A decade is a looooong time, honestly kudos to you for being able to put the makeup on every day, I could never. The reason I hide them is the exact same reason why you hid them, but at the same time I was also trying to find a point where I could sit down and tell the entire family about it. When the actual situation was super fresh I tried talking to him about it and he really shot me down quickly and told me to leave him alone.", "They did nothing, they are there, and he is assuming that they knew, which they didn't but they had an inkling that that is what I probably had beneath the long sleeves.", "When black sheep leaves, abuser turns to remaining people to continue abuse.", "It's very deep-rooted family issues, he is definitely an AH.", "I agree that they need to leave, I offered them the two free rooms for a reason.", "Been working since I was 16, saving up, and when I turned 18 and worked full time during university as an account manager/outstanding bill collector, I was able to save quite a bit of money. It was hard and I sacrificed plenty, but yeah...That's how I was able to get a 3 bedroom basement apartment.", "I totally agree he can disagree with my choices, that's fine, but when he starts taking it out on everyone it's not healthy. When we were on good terms I told him to go to therapy because his mental health was getting worse and it runs in his family as well, he said \"if I need to go then everyone else that causes my problems need to go (ie me, my mom, and brother)\" I said we should all go together, he wasn't pleased.", "I wanted to, but I had a savings goal I wanted to hit before leaving because I wanted to be completely sure I was not going to have to move back in.", "Thank you for all the advice", "If my father had been assigned the same surgeon he would refuse treatment probably, that's what's scary", "Completely off topic, but when I read that at first, I thought he tattooed your father's brain. :-)", "When he said the nurse's comment I think my jaw dropped, that's when I knew the hatred was serious I think. And yes, the cousin was estranged for a reason, and he got back at us by doing this.", "I agree with you fully. The way you handle things even as someone who doesn't like tattoos is normal. You don't get upset because it's not your body, and as I said I respect people's opinions, you're allowed to have these thoughts. My father's response is definitely over the top.", "I gave him notice a while ago that I would be moving out in April, now that this happened I just moved it forward. I'm paying for everything on my own so I'm not relying on him at all, it's not financially inconveniencing anyone.", "I don't expect them to change their minds, I got the tattoos and piercings for myself, it's not to impress anybody. I wore long sleeves because it was my choice to do so and it was what I wanted to wear. In addition to that when I first got a tattoo I was going to tell my father but he is not approachable and there was never a right time, if I had the opportunity to actually speak to him and tell him I would've but you don't know my father, and going so far as to insult my maturity and character because I never got the chance to actually sit down with my father and tell him is just down right rude. You don't know my situation", "I\u2019m sorry, you read this persons story and this is what you came to in conclusion?\nOP hid their body modifications because their father is abusive and grew up with that abuse. Do not victim blame them.", "Oh take off. This is what living with an abusive person does to people. OP is NTA, your comment is super judgemental though.", "I tried talking to him when the situation was fresh, I also tried talking to him two days before I left and he told me to leave him alone and don't speak unless spoken to. I think he needs time.", "The fact your mom and brother and are begging you to come back bc of your dad's treatment towards them now that you're gone speaks volumes about your place in the household. I'm going out on a limb here and guessing that you've been either the scapegoat or the peacekeeper in your household for a long time, and your mom and brother are finally getting a taste of what you've been dealing with for a long time. That is not your fault or on you in any way. You've offered them an escape route and it's up to them whether they take it or not. You're definitely NTA in this situation but the rest of your family sure are.", "If your Dad continues to act this way simply ask him why his dislike of tattoos is stronger than his love for his daughter. He needs some perspective!", "Thats emotionally abusive. He makes you feel fear so that he gets his way. That is emotional abuse.", "Its about control. He most likely has anxiety that he expresses in anger. You being out of the house means he's lost a little more control and now he's tightening his grip on those still close. \nHes a scared little boy dressed in big man shoes.", "If you fear him or have an inclination that he\u2019s escalating his behavior, that is reason enough to run away and never come back. This is def abnormal behavior and not healthy for anyone involved. Sending good vibes your way", "OP, your family is literally asking you to come back so that your father will be terrible to you instead of to them. \n\nThey're more than willing to use you as a meat shield. Why feel bad for people when they are presently demonstrating that they wouldn't feel bad for you in the same situation?\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Congratulations on being out.", "Yeah my family hate tattoos and they say so any time they are mentioned but they wouldn't shout at anyone over it and I'm sure they wouldn't even say so to anyone who had them unless they were asked what they thought. Even then I feel they would just politely say they don't like them.", "You did the right thing. You\u2019re not responsible for saving your mother and brother from your father\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s all on him. You did what you could.", "If they are **fearful** of him, then they are even bigger AH's. They think its fine to harass you and demand that you put yourself back into an abusive environment so your father can focus on insulting you instead of them??? Shameful.", "I wish that for you\u2026 don\u2019t let them make you question anything. You make the right decisions for you! Express yourself however you want to. Whether you wanna be fully covered and pierced or not, you are still the same person worth everything. You have one life to live, live it how you want and never let anyone make you second guess that. Including your parents", "I get that. My comments were reactionary tbh. \n\nHonestly since you agree about him being anxious & angry reactive I would recommend forming solid boundaries for yourself and learning to stone wall, only fleeing if you have to. \"I will hang up/ leave/ block you if you speak to me like that.\" (That being raised voice, curse words).\nIf you feel safe enough you can raise your voice right back and say harsh truths, but also do not hesitate to call police and hold behavior accountable. \nMy father was in federal prison for 6 years of my childhood for drugs and violent crimes. Diagnosed boarder line personality disorder with narcissistic behaviors. He was never violent with me but very manipulative, controlling and intimidating. \nI started being a solid front to him when I was 16. It changed things immediately and now that I am 26 I can say we have a MUCH better relationship. \nThough your father would need to WANT to do better and have a relationship with you. I dont know if that is the case, and if its not you'd have to be ok loosing him. \n\nI wish you the very best of luck.", ">the person who caused the rage.\n\nForgive yourself.  You did not cause the rage.  The abused is never responsible for the abuser's rage, whether it manifests mentally or physically.", "They could leave too. It\u2019s pretty shitty to ask you to come back so that your father can be abusive and shitty to you instead of them. They are expecting you to come home specially so you suffer just to make things easier on them.", "Well. Sucks for them. You actually *gave them the option of living with you*. If they don\u2019t take you up on your offer, they can live with their choice. But *you* don\u2019t have to move back and suffer.", "Yeah 4 summers with long sleeves sounds brutal. Especially if they\u2019re anything like a Colorado summer. I will venture to say you\u2019re probably wearing long sleeves every time you see your dad still", "I will also note. I live in one of the most tattooed cities in America. So this is an attitude that you really can't have here. It's so normal for me I don't even think about it. I have none myself. But I totally understand it all. Go and live your life get together with your family when you need. You're just fine. Don't carry any guilt.", "I'm really sorry to hear that! \n\n  \nI hope your mum and brother are safe and I'm sorry that you're being made a scapegoat for his abusive, controlling behaviour; I know it must be really hard for them to accept that their husband/dad is a big problem. I hope they're able to come to terms with the true nature of the situation while staying safe. \n\nIt was great of you to offer them a place to stay, too. You've done all the right things, please don't feel guilty and don't blame yourself for any of this!", "Yea, I would try and convince your mother/brother to leave and go NC. It isn't good/healthy for them to stay there.", "Tell him that Italy has the highest percent of people tattooed in their country. 48% of people have at least one tattoo. \n\nBut don't actually tell him that because he sucks. My parents hated tattoos, but when they found out I got one they just asked me to keep it covered. Which honestly didn't last long.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened \ud83d\ude1e hopefully after some time has passed he will come around. Once some time has passed it won\u2019t be as fresh and hopefully then you can have a more productive interaction.", "Man, being an asshole is fun /s", "In that case, NTA. Your dad probably wouldn't want you to stay with him now that the proverbial cat's out of the bag anyway.", "OP SAID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT ABUSE! She said she knew her father always hated tattoos. How is his personal feelings about tattoos abuse? OP is no victim.", "Agreed. Some people just can\u2019t help being dicks I think.\nAlso OP NTA, forgot to put that in earlier", "I\u2019m going to double down and that it\u2019s probable that OP just went through 4 years of college on daddy\u2019s dime.", "Well then that\u2019s all you can do!", "Peacekeeper of the household mostly, except for now...They've also been dealing with the same stuff though.", "Clearly it\u2019s not about the tattoos.", "I agree.", "[removed]", "I agree.", "Thank you for the good vibes.", "I think I feel bad because I inadvertently caused the situation and I should be there to \"take the punishment\"", "My father has always been extremely conservative with tattoos and body image etc. When I dyed my hair he thought I had a mental issue (when I dyed it because I had grey hairs that were extremely noticeable). He's always been like that, and unlike your family he will make a point to say he doesn't like tattoos with extreme distaste in his voice.", "When the situation was extremely fresh I tried to convey to my father that I am still the same person, nothing has changed except for me having tattoos that he doesn't even see.", "Thank you for the advice and the luck", "You're right.", "I guess you're right.", "You're right.", "They're definitely hot, but I don't think it's Colorado summer hot, my body has adjusted and gotten used to being covered all the time so, to be honest it's been hard getting out of that groove. Out of respect for my father (if he ever decides to reach out) I would continue to wear long sleeves around him.", "Thank you..", "I actually had no clue about that fun fact. I kept mine covered firstly because I feel like if I came down randomly one day in a t-shirt everyone would have a heart attack, and second I was trying to find the correct time to sit everyone down and tell them", "Hopefully, I am hoping for that outcome.", "I don't know what his view is on me leaving but he did have a bit of a problem when I told him i was going to be leaving in April.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/sctt_dot \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rpted/aita_for_moving_out_after_my_dad_found_out_about/j6wvwhx/\n\nBot Reported.", "You don\u2019t deserve to be punished because your dad is being ridiculous. You did nothing wrong getting tattooed, not telling him or moving out. He needs to grow up or your mom and brother need to move out because he\u2019s abusive and not going to change.", "But you offered them a place to go! They prefer to have you there suffering instead of the option where no one suffers at all. \n\nI'm not trying to diagnose your dad, but this sounds a lot like a narcissistic family structure designed to protect your dad. \n\nAgain, congratulations on getting out and being the person you want to be, not that your father wants you to be.", "Sorry you had to deal with that, at least you were able to move out though.", "My parents don\u2019t like tattoos, never have, my siblings and I all have tattoos. They have made maybe a small joke once or twice, but are always respectful of our choices since it\u2019s our body. \n\nThis father is abusive and horrible, I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this. You did the right thing leaving. Sending all the good vibes\ud83d\udda4", "It\u2019s harder to control you if you\u2019re not under his roof.", "It's even funnier when you notice the error in the sentence.", "It's okay. Thank you.", "Thank you for sending good vibes.", "You're right."]}
