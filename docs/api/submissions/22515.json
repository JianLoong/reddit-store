I\u2019ve always been very careful about allergies and food regulation. I\u2019m even like that at home.

As a cook, you would never be legally liable for someone getting sick in a restaurant. All of that would fall on the restaurant itself and the owners, not on the cooks. You could potentially lose your job but that's it. \n\nI worked as a line cook and we got sued over something that I personally cooked. It was during a super busy rush and we had a new server who wasn't aware of exactly what was in every dish and didn't bother to ask the cooks. He asked us if one dish had eggs because a kid at one of the tables had a severe egg allergy. We told him that we could make the dish without (grilled fish instead of battered) and to make a note on the ticket about the allergy so we were aware. \n\nThe server put the ticket in without specifying that it was for the table with the allergy. Well, the kid ended up ordering a burger instead and our burgers were made with eggs. Kid had such a severe reaction that he spent the night in the hospital and the restaurant had to foot the bill, but obviously they couldn't come after the cooks or the server (server didn't even lose his job although he definitely should have).", "excellent point. have you tried telling him that the restaurant can get in trouble legally if he were to fall ill from eating the steak at the temp he requests?", "Our steaks our the worst quality thing in the restaurant because we don\u2019t sell many. You don\u2019t want them raw I promise. \n\nI have no problem recooking an order if I mess up but this is just ridiculous and has been going on for at least 5 months if not longer. It\u2019s also a HUGE amount of waste.", "Trust me it isn\u2019t. And I need to stress I didn\u2019t cook the 80 degree steak.
