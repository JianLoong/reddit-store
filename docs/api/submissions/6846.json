Your daughter doesn\u2019t need that now either, she needs support not to be dumped with additional emotional baggage.

His refusal to let us see his emotions was due to internalised misoginy and only helped that misoginy develop further.

This is a super short post with no context. It\u2019s really hard to make an accurate assessment without knowing more. Absolutely, first read, easy YTA\u2026 except I have experience that makes me wonder if we know the whole story. \n\nMy (42F) husband (38M) is a 100% permanently & totally disabled combat veteran with severe PTSD. Spent 2 years in the old Walter Reed doing 50000 surgeries & relearning how to walk, the VA\u2019s shitty medical care then nearly killed him again, we\u2019ve spent 12 years together in & out of hospitals more times than I can count. 1 year ago, I rushed our 5 month old baby boy to the ER with what turned out to be infantile spasms (extremely rare & catastrophic seizures), significant brain abnormalities, & a severe genetic disorder. It was during COVID, only 1 parent allowed to stay overnight (you couldn\u2019t even swap) but both could visit daytime. I lived with our baby there for weeks. My husband COULD. NOT. DO. IT. He tried. My God he tried. He\u2019d show up, turn white as a sheet, try his best but his anxiety & PTSD were off the charts. How is that helpful to our baby, or to me, or to the medical staff, or to our other child (5M)? He\u2019d come bring me clothes, say hi to the baby, but he\u2019d max out at 20 minutes. He physically could not handle that level of conflicting emotion. He\u2019d call me multiple times a day. He wanted to hear doctor visit discussions. I TOLD him to go home. To take care of 5M. I gave him permission not to try & be someone he wasn\u2019t, not to have to hate himself for \u201cfailing\u201d to be someone he isn\u2019t, not to have to see it as a failure in the first place. I needed his help taking care of 5M, our pets, the house. I let him know \u201cit\u2019s ok - I seem to handle this one better. This one is going to break you, that\u2019s totally unnecessary, & I don\u2019t need to be distracted trying to care for you, too. Let\u2019s divide & conquer.\u201d\n\nFolks on here are saying OP is selfish & doesn\u2019t care about his daughter. But everyone - EVERYONE - has limitations. No matter how much you love your kids, you\u2019ll fail them. You won\u2019t be able to do something you \u201cshould,\u201d or you\u2019ll be worse at it than somebody else\u2019s parents. But being so overcome you have to leave isn\u2019t selfish. It\u2019s potentially someone not physically capable of processing that much pain & huge emotion, struggling to find some sense or solution to a situation so painful even a paragon of mental health would crumble. \n\nThe fact that my baby won\u2019t remember it does make it slightly different - but I will remember. My husband will remember. And the mother could have set a very different tone, which might have helped the daughter understand & not feel rejected. The MOTHER is just as big an AH here. Her daughter doesn\u2019t need to hear her venting her frustration. Worrying about mom & dads marriage is not her burden to carry, especially now. It sounds more to me like mom is turning some of her fear about her daughter into anger pointed at OP (very common), & when SHE felt unsupported during such a difficult time (or was trying to protect their daughter from feeling abandoned), she snapped & was totally out of line in alienating her husband more. It\u2019s so sad - but the chances of divorcing after a serious child illness are staggering. My husband & I made a conscious choice - I MADE A DECISION - to treat him with compassion, to see him for who he IS & not what it\u2019s easy to turn it into. And to accept - this is who he is. Love has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s not unwillingness. It\u2019s incapability. \n\nBefore we start talking about OP\u2019s cowardice, remember that despite being completely traumatized by seeing his daughter so close to death, OP WENT BACK. He tried again. That is NOT cowardice. My point? We don\u2019t know enough here. Things aren\u2019t always as they seem. IT IS NOT ASSHOLE TO HAVE HUMAN LIMITATIONS. Not everyone can be everything, even if they want to. Every human being we choose to have a relationship with will, at some point, disappoint us & hurt us due to their character deficiencies. OP certainly hurt his family, but it doesn\u2019t seem obviously selfishly or in malice or abdication. It seems to me like there may be a case of \u201cI cannot process this so I WILL leave to collect myself & try again.\u201d Sometimes, people need grace. And trust me - if you\u2019ve never had a child nearly die, you honestly (in the most loving way possible) don\u2019t know WTF you\u2019re talking about. \n\nTLDR: Need more info. Were you too upset & didn\u2019t want to cause your daughter anxiety by seeing you hysterically break down? Or do you just not like feeling big feelings? Did you try discussing with your wife ways you can be supportive but also not be thrust into something that legitimately can give you PTSD? My husband offered to fix things around the house, to bring me my favorite clothes and wash the laundry I sent back home, keep our five-year-old in school and up-to-date with his responsibilities, cook and clean the house, all of it. It isn\u2019t your wife\u2019s responsibility to do all of the hospital duty \u2013 it is just as traumatic for her, regardless of whether or not it looks that way to you. It is entirely acceptable if you cannot be at the hospital for long periods. Can you 2 come up with a rotating schedule? Can you make a list of things you can do to make her time there easier? If she\u2019s well enough, can you FaceTime your daughter from home? Can you set a time limit for your visits, and may be during a time of the day that your daughter is the most awake? Those are all things that helped us. Good luck and Godspeed man.", "YTA. This is bad mate.

My son's father stuck him on the front of a snowmobile when he was six years old, and then went far too fast and lost control. The windshield separated the end of his nose from his face. This man drove my boy six hours to me because he couldn't cope with taking him to a local hospital alone. It took four hospital staff and myself to restrain him and about five ish hours. That kid bested even the most seasoned doctor. Finally got it done and where was dad? Sitting on a chair crying about how he couldn't touch him because seeing him this way broke his heart.

The statistics for divorce among heterosexual couples when a woman is diagnosed with cancer vs a man are downright depressing.

First off what creates the impression she is not important enough for him is his behavior, not the accurate description of his behavior. But also it clearly frames the problem as being with the father and the father alone, unlike your version. You start off by saying \"some people struggle to process their loved ones in pain and suffering.\" This is a lie. He's not struggling-he completely gave up and fled. He's barely phoning it in to the point that his sick daughter notices. But  more important to that being an outright lie, it creates this idea that the problem is her suffering not her father's inability to be there for her.   \n\n\nThe problem here is her father and his behavior.

He left *the hospital*. He could have stayed in the waiting room and been there for his wife when their daughter fell asleep. If he can't stand seeing his child that way, I get it - fuck I get emotional when I see *my pets* in sad medical situations, and they aren't human children (but they're my children). But he left the hospital completely while his wife sat there all night with no support? Sorry, but no. Maybe she could have phrased it better, but nothing she said was a lie.", "I obviously disagree. She is an absolute for AH way she put it on her daughter.  Her daughter didn\u2019t need to hear her father is a coward. She needed to be reassured that her father cares but is fearful. I\u2019m sure the daughter is feeling pretty scared and wanting to run away but physical can\u2019t. Not she has to wonder if she is a coward. \n\nIt was shameful, hateful, and selfish.

We all feel fear and you are doing amazingly is staying brave.\u201d\n\nShe chose to be mean and put the burden and doubt on her daughter.

Which, is fair enough. As I know have bias, I have witnessed hundreds of family\u2019s over the past three years. I was fortunate enough to be there for my child through it even when it was hard. But I spoke to many parents that struggled mightily. They are still flawed humans. In most cases they loved their children but their children or spouses still suffered through their weakness or inability to process. It\u2019s partly why 80% of all childhood cancer diagnosis end with the parents getting divorced. \n\nAs to the mother she said it when he could hear. She used her daughter. She has every right to be angry and hurt to be doing this alone and feel rage for her daughter. But that response is selfish and unnecessary and puts the burden along with the fear the child is feeling on the child. Anger is a normal part of the process but just being there doesn\u2019t mean anything if you are doing damage. Both for mom and dad. They both need to put their selfishness aside. \n\nWas is dad that wasn\u2019t there for you?", "Labeling someone a coward is so reductive and permanent that is creates a situation for a child that they can be labeled something like that is they experience weakness. Something this girl is likely to come up against in her fight. It also shows that mom may reduce me to a name and measure me by that. That\u2019s not something I would want to put on my child fighting for her life. \n\nIt also shows that in an adult relationship name calling is an option. Assuming, the daughter gets better she now has been shown that we can reduce our partners to a name in the worst possible situation. As parents it\u2019s our job to be honest and explain situations even complex ones to our children so they can understand and grow. Yes, the father\u2019s behavior was to a similar or the same implication asa coward, but taking the time to apply context and not admonishing would create understanding and allow the child something to work through. While showing her that we don\u2019t name call our partner their father. The mother didn\u2019t do this. She taught her daughter that when we come up short we call people names. We reduce them to their worst possible label. I feel so bad for that girl.", "*It sounds like you might have a great amount of bias*  \n\n\nYes, it's called experience.  \n\n\n*It\u2019s partly why 80% of all childhood cancer diagnosis end with the parents getting divorced.*  \n\n\nI'm very aware of the divorce rates for the parents of kids with cancer.
