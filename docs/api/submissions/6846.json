Your daughter doesn\u2019t need that now either, she needs support not to be dumped with additional emotional baggage.

His refusal to let us see his emotions was due to internalised misoginy and only helped that misoginy develop further.

This is a super short post with no context. It\u2019s really hard to make an accurate assessment without knowing more. Absolutely, first read, easy YTA\u2026 except I have experience that makes me wonder if we know the whole story. \n\nMy (42F) husband (38M) is a 100% permanently & totally disabled combat veteran with severe PTSD. Spent 2 years in the old Walter Reed doing 50000 surgeries & relearning how to walk, the VA\u2019s shitty medical care then nearly killed him again, we\u2019ve spent 12 years together in & out of hospitals more times than I can count. 1 year ago, I rushed our 5 month old baby boy to the ER with what turned out to be infantile spasms (extremely rare & catastrophic seizures), significant brain abnormalities, & a severe genetic disorder. It was during COVID, only 1 parent allowed to stay overnight (you couldn\u2019t even swap) but both could visit daytime. I lived with our baby there for weeks. My husband COULD. NOT. DO. IT. He tried. My God he tried. He\u2019d show up, turn white as a sheet, try his best but his anxiety & PTSD were off the charts. How is that helpful to our baby, or to me, or to the medical staff, or to our other child (5M)? He\u2019d come bring me clothes, say hi to the baby, but he\u2019d max out at 20 minutes. He physically could not handle that level of conflicting emotion. He\u2019d call me multiple times a day. He wanted to hear doctor visit discussions. I TOLD him to go home. To take care of 5M. I gave him permission not to try & be someone he wasn\u2019t, not to have to hate himself for \u201cfailing\u201d to be someone he isn\u2019t, not to have to see it as a failure in the first place. I needed his help taking care of 5M, our pets, the house. I let him know \u201cit\u2019s ok - I seem to handle this one better. This one is going to break you, that\u2019s totally unnecessary, & I don\u2019t need to be distracted trying to care for you, too. Let\u2019s divide & conquer.\u201d\n\nFolks on here are saying OP is selfish & doesn\u2019t care about his daughter. But everyone - EVERYONE - has limitations. No matter how much you love your kids, you\u2019ll fail them. You won\u2019t be able to do something you \u201cshould,\u201d or you\u2019ll be worse at it than somebody else\u2019s parents. But being so overcome you have to leave isn\u2019t selfish. It\u2019s potentially someone not physically capable of processing that much pain & huge emotion, struggling to find some sense or solution to a situation so painful even a paragon of mental health would crumble. \n\nThe fact that my baby won\u2019t remember it does make it slightly different - but I will remember. My husband will remember. And the mother could have set a very different tone, which might have helped the daughter understand & not feel rejected. The MOTHER is just as big an AH here. Her daughter doesn\u2019t need to hear her venting her frustration. Worrying about mom & dads marriage is not her burden to carry, especially now. It sounds more to me like mom is turning some of her fear about her daughter into anger pointed at OP (very common), & when SHE felt unsupported during such a difficult time (or was trying to protect their daughter from feeling abandoned), she snapped & was totally out of line in alienating her husband more. It\u2019s so sad - but the chances of divorcing after a serious child illness are staggering. My husband & I made a conscious choice - I MADE A DECISION - to treat him with compassion, to see him for who he IS & not what it\u2019s easy to turn it into. And to accept - this is who he is. Love has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s not unwillingness. It\u2019s incapability. \n\nBefore we start talking about OP\u2019s cowardice, remember that despite being completely traumatized by seeing his daughter so close to death, OP WENT BACK. He tried again. That is NOT cowardice. My point? We don\u2019t know enough here. Things aren\u2019t always as they seem. IT IS NOT ASSHOLE TO HAVE HUMAN LIMITATIONS. Not everyone can be everything, even if they want to. Every human being we choose to have a relationship with will, at some point, disappoint us & hurt us due to their character deficiencies. OP certainly hurt his family, but it doesn\u2019t seem obviously selfishly or in malice or abdication. It seems to me like there may be a case of \u201cI cannot process this so I WILL leave to collect myself & try again.\u201d Sometimes, people need grace. And trust me - if you\u2019ve never had a child nearly die, you honestly (in the most loving way possible) don\u2019t know WTF you\u2019re talking about. \n\nTLDR: Need more info. Were you too upset & didn\u2019t want to cause your daughter anxiety by seeing you hysterically break down? Or do you just not like feeling big feelings? Did you try discussing with your wife ways you can be supportive but also not be thrust into something that legitimately can give you PTSD? My husband offered to fix things around the house, to bring me my favorite clothes and wash the laundry I sent back home, keep our five-year-old in school and up-to-date with his responsibilities, cook and clean the house, all of it. It isn\u2019t your wife\u2019s responsibility to do all of the hospital duty \u2013 it is just as traumatic for her, regardless of whether or not it looks that way to you. It is entirely acceptable if you cannot be at the hospital for long periods. Can you 2 come up with a rotating schedule? Can you make a list of things you can do to make her time there easier? If she\u2019s well enough, can you FaceTime your daughter from home? Can you set a time limit for your visits, and may be during a time of the day that your daughter is the most awake? Those are all things that helped us. Good luck and Godspeed man.", "YTA. This is bad mate.

Mom validated that and proved that no matter what, she will always be there for the daughter. Daughter needs a strong validating presence, not an excuse-making wishy washy toxically positive one.", "Thank you. Not everyone is made of steel. Everyone deals with things differently. Maybe tomorrow mom can\u2019t deal and dad is able to. \nSometimes I hate the judgemental jerks on Reddit.", "Ugh dude....I'm sorry for what you are dealing with. It is understandable that seeing your daughter in that state would be more overwhelming than words can describe. It's completely human to not be able to handle things like that, and it would have been ok if you needed to leave the room to gather yourself. But, to leave the hospital. \n\nI really don't want to say yta. I was diagnosed with a progressive and terminal disease when I was 7, my parents were told I likely wouldn't see age 13. I had right heart catherizations and got central lines (both required anethesia), and at age 9 I had open heart surgery. I knew how scared both my parents were. My dad had this coin (penny I think) encased in some kind of stone (I want to say marble), he showed it to me after my open heart. He ran his fingers over it so much that the edge rounded, it was a squared off sharp edge before my surgery. From age 9/10 to about age 14/15 I was going under anesthesia to either replace my central line (my body kept rejecting it, this is not normal for central lines, in which i had to rush to the er to get an IV placed while waiting to get another one placed) or for another right heart cath, about every 3 months. That doesn't include all the other tests I went for (about every 3 months and eventually about every 6 months). That doesn't include the time I lost my central line whole visiting my cousin in Italy. And whatever else happened that I don't actually remember \n\nHere's the thing, despite me knowing how scared they were....they never showed it. Their level of fear and anxiety was never greater than mine. Looking back, that helped me be able to focus on things like, I was getting my first dog after my surgery instead of after all our cats died (which would have been around age 16). Despite having talks with them about the seriousness of what I was dealing with, their strength when around me was what made me not as scared as I could, and probably should have been. I have only realized this as an adult and looking back. I honestly don't know if I would have done as well, been as confident as I was or anything had they been that scared. \n\nAgain, I can completely understand how unbelievably overwhelming and scary it would be for you to see her like that. How impossible it is to keep from playing out the worse case scenarios in your head. Again, needing to step away from her for a moment to break down, be scared, and pull yourself together would have been perfectly OK, and is what you need to do here on out. Leaving the hospital was a bad, bad move. I'm sure you didn't mean it, but you abandoned your daughter. I am having a hard time saying yta though because this is truly a situation that is beyond being an ah or not.\n\nYour wife on the other hand, is an ah. She should have never told your daughter you are a coward. She needed to support you and tell her that you are having a hard time, that you love her, that you are and will be there for her. That you allowed your fear to overtake you and it overwhelmed you, but it's ok, because you are stronger than that and you are there for her.\n\nDon't be to mad at your wife though. She did and said some very hurtful things, but I am.sure she is just as scared and worried as you are. She also needed you as much as your daughter does, and she probably felt like you abandoned her too. DO NOT allow your fear, your grief, your desperation to drive a wedge between you and your wife. You daughter needs both of you, and you need each other. \n\nApologize to both of them. To your wife, remind her it's ok to be weak sometimes, but she doesn't have to be alone in being the strong one. Both of you be the strong ones for your daughters sake. Take turns breaking down and holding each other. Allow each other their moments, and allow your daughter to be scared as well as brave. Being brave together, is much easier than carrying the weight of the world by yourself. If you find yourself overwhelmed, step out of the room. Go get a soda, or something to eat, take a walk.arounf the halls, go talk to a nurse. Nurses are there for.the family as well as the patient (just don't keep her from doing her job) they will help support you to an extent. But after you take a moment, you pull yourself together and go back in and be next to your daughter and your wife. You let your wife go take her walk, go get her soda. Be honest with your daughter. Tell her your scared and worried, that you love her, that together you can be brave for each other. Take it from someone who was the child laying in the hospital bed, it's ok to be weak in front of her, as long as you don't leave her. \n\nI am sorry for what your family is going through. All the happy and healing vibes to all three of you. Please, do not allow yourself to be consumed by this mistake. Learn from it, and don't repeat it. Also please, you and your wife at least, please go get counseling. Individually and together. One of the absolute worse things you can do for your daughter right now is to allow what she is going through to tear you apart. But you can't fake things being ok, it will show. Get help, be strong but remember that it's ok to be and feel helpless and not know what to do. Just do it together.\n\nEdit to Add: IDK what's going on with your daughter.

I stayed the whole fucking time with her, because that\u2019s what parents do.", "That\u2019s what moms do.  I wish I could say, \u201cThat\u2019s what parents do.\u201d  Someday that will be true.", "Mom probably came back for a shower and a change of clothes. Yelling at AH dad is a bonus.", "I really doubt she said it to the daughter and finally saw a comment that felt the same. I can\u2019t even be sure that the wife used the word \u201ccoward\u201d or trust much of OP\u2019s characterization since this is a man who abandons his child, his child who is I\u2019ll in a hospital bed.\n\nEdit: typo", "\"He's a coward,\" means, \"you're half coward\" to his child.\n\n\"He's afraid,\" is the truth, but hits differently.", "In this sub, I personally take what the person says as the best info I have, even if I often poke at gaps they leave in their own perspective for the average person. Considering many still manage to fully be TA, I think there's value to a judgment there, even if the other person/people don't hop on and give their view.", "I see your point but this could put it on the daughter to caretaker her father\u2019s feelings, instead of seeing it has wholly his problem. Happens a lot. She should be focused on herself and getting better, not her dad\u2019s feelings.", "The problem with this statement is that it then becomes daughter's responsibility to make dad feel better, rather than dad's responsibility to be there for his daughter. \n\nWife is dealing with fear, grief, and anger. It's not even reasonable to expect her to talk to daughter this way, even if your suggested statement is appropriate.", "I was thinking the same. How do we know what was said from this excuse of a father? The mum may well have called him a coward but immediately followed it up by saying that he was scared of hospitals but he loves his daughter very much, which puts it in a different context. Or that how brave the daughter is because she hates hospitals too... Was the daughter even awake because does it matter what she says in a 10 second vent at that point?\nPeople can debate the rights and wrongs of a one sided biased account till the cows come home but it won't change the fact that he failed his daughter when she needed him....", "Yeah, have mom clean up his mess. He DOESNT know he needs to do better because he posted on here asking if he was in the wrong. \n\nSorry I hardcore disagree. If we want our kids to hold themselves accountable for their actions, parents gotta do the same. Coward is an understatement.", "No. Don\u2019t say anything that comes across like it\u2019s the daughters fault for being sick and what you said does.\n The daughter shouldn\u2019t be told a single word of her fathers \u201cstruggle\u201d", "True, name calling fixes it.", "So in other words she gave her sick child something to feel stressed and uncomfortable about? She was an AH", "Doesn't look like father is allowed to have a hard time though according to most comments.", "And many times has mom carried the family always been strong.  \n\nI don't think this is the first time he couldn't handle something and went away.\n\nThis is probably repeated behaviour.", "sure but that doesn't make mom less of an AH. poor kid is stuck with a dad who can't suck it up and a mom who jumps at the chance to make dad look worse", "But mom isn\u2019t putting her daughter first if she\u2019s using her as a pawn in an argument with her husband. \n\nNever put your kids in the middle.", "I'm ok with her privately confronting OP for this huge parental failure, but she's essentially dumping her marital baggage on her kid. Is the goal to get OP to pull himself together & be present, or to drive him away forever & make sure daughter hates him, too?", "Also how old is the child? Because 1) if the child is younger than 15, dad deserves what he gets and is despicable. 2) if older than 15, they don\u2019t need to hear \u201cdaddy had a bad moment\u201d because they know that\u2019s horseshit.", "I'm pretty convinced that OP is not telling it as it went. It sounds like from a whole conversation maybe he heard that one word and didn't like it. \n\nIn his own words, in his own post, he tells us about himself, that he needs everything to be about him. We only hear about his wife all the things he got upset about, even that she spent the time with her daughter seemed to irk him. \n\nSo as you're saying, we don't know what she really said or did. \nYelling at him, I get. Let's not forget, it's hard for the mom too, and he just dropped the ball for her to pick up the slack, be there for the daughter, comfort her, and expected her to comfort him, too. Just dropped the whole load including his own emotional state on her, not caring about his daughter or his wife.\n\nI agree that not every behavior on the wife's part would be \"sanctioned\" by his shitty behavior. But e don't really know what she did, besides being there for the daughter instead of him\n\nHe's asking if he's TA based on his own behavior, and yes. Yes he is.\nOP, YTA.", "Absolutely this.\n\nAlso, the sugar-coated reply suggested above treads dangerously close to making the kid\u2019s illness about op\u2019s emotions. There\u2019s no way kiddo should have to bear the weight of managing her parent\u2019s emotions even in the best of circumstances, let alone while seriously ill. Stop being a coward.\n\nI shuddered at\n\n> that\u2019s not my daughter.\n\nYes it bloody-well is, op. She doesn\u2019t stop being your kid just because she\u2019s no longer shiny and bubbly. Step up and manage your own emotions like an adult.", "Daddy is a coward, daughter is 50% Daddy, so daughter must also be part coward. That thought can stick around long after whatever put her in the hospital is resolved (assuming it's not terminal). Parents should be able to refrain from name-calling for this reason, amongst others.\n\nOP is obviously the ultimate AH here, no doubt about it. But gentle ESH because mom defaulted to name-calling dad in front of kid.\n\nI'll sit back and enjoy all the down-votes from people who have never witnessed the effects on children of parents who just can't stop themselves from bad-mouthing each other in front of their kids.", "OP\u2019s daughter knows her dad wasn\u2019t there. She can sense he didn\u2019t put her first. Telling her he loves her unequivocally under the circumstances is only going to mess with her head and make her mistrust her instincts.\n\nSource: had to be told by my daughter to stop telling her dad loves her so she can stop questioning herself.", "The kid isn't stupid.", "WOMEN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SHOULDER THE MENTAL LOAD FOR THEIR HUSBANDS.", "Mom is struggling alone with no support from dad. Maybe not the best comment to make to daughter, but it is bang on. You can't expect her to be perfect when she's doing the lion's share of emotional work during a very painful situation.", "Mom is not in any shape or form an AH here.", "Huh?\n\nWe aren't carbon copies, fifty fifty split. Daughter isn't four, she's fourteen. \n\nSit back and enjoy, but a lot of the downvotes would also be coming from people who are forced to swallow their own emotions and expected to frame perfect responses to cover for other's failures.", ">You got that right!mom was just as afraid as the father. \n\nApparently not.", "Or it just eases kid\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t love me anymore bc I\u2019m sick\u201d is a fair jump for a child\u2019s brain to make.\n\nThe stronger parent assuaging that ADDITIONAL pain/fear/anxiety in the CHILD is the right thing to do.\n\nCall your spouse a coward/loser outside the presence of the child, who needs to feel as much safety and stability and peace as possible.\n\nBoth parents are assholes here.", "Wow, so you are saying parents are not allowed to show feelings in front of their children? Of course they are, they are human! It's not the best solution but it would obviously have been better than what OP did - leaving his daughter who is probably extremely scared of the situation too alone. Sometimes it's not possible to hide your feelings, especially not when you're taken by surprise like OP was when he saw the way his daughter looked. You should be ashamed of yourself for shaming feelings like this. People like you are probably the reason why OP felt he had to leave - and no, I'm not saying this to defend him but it's probably a part of the reason why he let down his child so massively here; because society taught him from an early age that he's not allowed to cry. And you are confirming this by shaming him. We can't always control our tears, we are not fucking robots! Take this from someone who's able to cry right next to other people without anyone noticing, even my closest family. I taught myself to cry in an extremely controlled way without any sound or body movement at all (which is very unhealthy btw) but even I can't always control my tears, and at very rare occasions I get to cry  uncontrollably which is a huge relief because so much sorrow is stuck inside of me.", "I wasn't speaking scientifically, I know it's not 50/50 split. When you bad-mouth your child's parent to your child, you are bad-mouthing a part of them.\n\nI am one of those people forced to swallow my emotions and frame perfect responses for failures of another parent. You have to do it for the kids, regardless of the situation, and if you don't, you are unfortunately an AH. I have 2 kids older than 14. Still relevant at those ages.", "Having been the child I don\u2019t really have any sympathy for parents who can\u2019t put on the game face and I would have appreciated the honesty if my parent had pulled this. It\u2019s always much, much, much harder to be the actual patient.\n\nETA: I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that Reddit downvotes the perspectives of disabled kids but never parents of disabled kids but y\u2019all still disappoint me"]}
