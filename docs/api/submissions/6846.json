Your daughter doesn\u2019t need that now either, she needs support not to be dumped with additional emotional baggage.

His refusal to let us see his emotions was due to internalised misoginy and only helped that misoginy develop further.

This is a super short post with no context. It\u2019s really hard to make an accurate assessment without knowing more. Absolutely, first read, easy YTA\u2026 except I have experience that makes me wonder if we know the whole story. \n\nMy (42F) husband (38M) is a 100% permanently & totally disabled combat veteran with severe PTSD. Spent 2 years in the old Walter Reed doing 50000 surgeries & relearning how to walk, the VA\u2019s shitty medical care then nearly killed him again, we\u2019ve spent 12 years together in & out of hospitals more times than I can count. 1 year ago, I rushed our 5 month old baby boy to the ER with what turned out to be infantile spasms (extremely rare & catastrophic seizures), significant brain abnormalities, & a severe genetic disorder. It was during COVID, only 1 parent allowed to stay overnight (you couldn\u2019t even swap) but both could visit daytime. I lived with our baby there for weeks. My husband COULD. NOT. DO. IT. He tried. My God he tried. He\u2019d show up, turn white as a sheet, try his best but his anxiety & PTSD were off the charts. How is that helpful to our baby, or to me, or to the medical staff, or to our other child (5M)? He\u2019d come bring me clothes, say hi to the baby, but he\u2019d max out at 20 minutes. He physically could not handle that level of conflicting emotion. He\u2019d call me multiple times a day. He wanted to hear doctor visit discussions. I TOLD him to go home. To take care of 5M. I gave him permission not to try & be someone he wasn\u2019t, not to have to hate himself for \u201cfailing\u201d to be someone he isn\u2019t, not to have to see it as a failure in the first place. I needed his help taking care of 5M, our pets, the house. I let him know \u201cit\u2019s ok - I seem to handle this one better. This one is going to break you, that\u2019s totally unnecessary, & I don\u2019t need to be distracted trying to care for you, too. Let\u2019s divide & conquer.\u201d\n\nFolks on here are saying OP is selfish & doesn\u2019t care about his daughter. But everyone - EVERYONE - has limitations. No matter how much you love your kids, you\u2019ll fail them. You won\u2019t be able to do something you \u201cshould,\u201d or you\u2019ll be worse at it than somebody else\u2019s parents. But being so overcome you have to leave isn\u2019t selfish. It\u2019s potentially someone not physically capable of processing that much pain & huge emotion, struggling to find some sense or solution to a situation so painful even a paragon of mental health would crumble. \n\nThe fact that my baby won\u2019t remember it does make it slightly different - but I will remember. My husband will remember. And the mother could have set a very different tone, which might have helped the daughter understand & not feel rejected. The MOTHER is just as big an AH here. Her daughter doesn\u2019t need to hear her venting her frustration. Worrying about mom & dads marriage is not her burden to carry, especially now. It sounds more to me like mom is turning some of her fear about her daughter into anger pointed at OP (very common), & when SHE felt unsupported during such a difficult time (or was trying to protect their daughter from feeling abandoned), she snapped & was totally out of line in alienating her husband more. It\u2019s so sad - but the chances of divorcing after a serious child illness are staggering. My husband & I made a conscious choice - I MADE A DECISION - to treat him with compassion, to see him for who he IS & not what it\u2019s easy to turn it into. And to accept - this is who he is. Love has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s not unwillingness. It\u2019s incapability. \n\nBefore we start talking about OP\u2019s cowardice, remember that despite being completely traumatized by seeing his daughter so close to death, OP WENT BACK. He tried again. That is NOT cowardice. My point? We don\u2019t know enough here. Things aren\u2019t always as they seem. IT IS NOT ASSHOLE TO HAVE HUMAN LIMITATIONS. Not everyone can be everything, even if they want to. Every human being we choose to have a relationship with will, at some point, disappoint us & hurt us due to their character deficiencies. OP certainly hurt his family, but it doesn\u2019t seem obviously selfishly or in malice or abdication. It seems to me like there may be a case of \u201cI cannot process this so I WILL leave to collect myself & try again.\u201d Sometimes, people need grace. And trust me - if you\u2019ve never had a child nearly die, you honestly (in the most loving way possible) don\u2019t know WTF you\u2019re talking about. \n\nTLDR: Need more info. Were you too upset & didn\u2019t want to cause your daughter anxiety by seeing you hysterically break down? Or do you just not like feeling big feelings? Did you try discussing with your wife ways you can be supportive but also not be thrust into something that legitimately can give you PTSD? My husband offered to fix things around the house, to bring me my favorite clothes and wash the laundry I sent back home, keep our five-year-old in school and up-to-date with his responsibilities, cook and clean the house, all of it. It isn\u2019t your wife\u2019s responsibility to do all of the hospital duty \u2013 it is just as traumatic for her, regardless of whether or not it looks that way to you. It is entirely acceptable if you cannot be at the hospital for long periods. Can you 2 come up with a rotating schedule? Can you make a list of things you can do to make her time there easier? If she\u2019s well enough, can you FaceTime your daughter from home? Can you set a time limit for your visits, and may be during a time of the day that your daughter is the most awake? Those are all things that helped us. Good luck and Godspeed man.", "YTA. This is bad mate.

He was a very bright shining light of love in this world and now he is gone.\n\nIf it was one of my boys I would be all up in that shit.  OMG -- this is your CHILD.  Honestly you suck so bad.", "YTA. You're the parent. Doesn't matter how hard it is for you- your child comes first. Take a break and use the bathroom or go grab a coffee then go back. Running away home is pathetic and what a coward would do. No matter how upset you are, I guarantee your daughter feels it 10x worse, especially since you don't have the guts to support her through this.", "YTA - your poor child.  I'm sorry she is ill and dealing with this kind of nightmare.  I hope her mother finds the resources you all need to get through this.\n\nI've never had a sick child but I'm helped dying parents and at no time were they left in the hospital solo.  Your child needed somebody to tell her that everything will be alright - that she will grow up and have all the wonderful experiences that life might offer her. Patients need advocate for everything from pillows to treatment.  that was your job.  Your first reaction was to think about yourself .  Other people would process the nightmare later.\n\nWhat is highly likely is that your wife now knows how strong you will be when she needs you in her future.  Once your childs illness has been addressed, she probably decide are you still worth the years investment she had planned", "My son was hospitalized with a virus (two simultaneously, actually) at 10 months old. The hospital would not allow both parents to stay the night. My husband and I were exhausted - we'd already had several sleepless nights before things got bad enough for a hospital admit. But I was holding it together a bit better than my husband, so I told him to go and try to get a few hours of sleep. He told me later that leaving the hospital that night was the hardest thing he'd ever done. He cried the entire drive home and called his mom to help him through the emotional torture of walking away from his sick baby. \n\nSomething is wrong with OP.", "I broke my spine and my mom didn\u2019t even bother to come see me. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever really get over that", "I cannot get over this. My daughter had open heart surgery at 2.5 years old, I left the hospital one single time just to shower and come right back and I made sure my parents were there to sit with her while I was gone in case she woke up. The amount of tubes, wires, needles, and whatever else was connected to her was insane, she was intubated and unconscious for what seemed like forever. I can't imagine leaving her in that state at any age. And guess what my husband was there a fraction of the time and I am still angry over it years later! You be there for your children Op, no matter how uncomfortable you are! \n\nCrying does not show weakness, it does not make you look bad!

You'll have to figure out some way to earn back the respect of both your wife and daughter.", "I think it was more a matter of reaching his limit but not even being able to admit that he did and ask for help, and not even being able to admit it in the post. See how he dances around his own reactions. \n\nHe's still the asshole for the way he handled it, though.", "He was scared. He's a father and he didn't want his daughter to see the fear in his eyes. He knew he couldn't stand there and lie to his daughter as parents so often try to do to calm their child. My father is the same way as is my mother.\n\nI was nine when I was hit with an infection growing in my hip joint. No one knew what it was but I was in agony for hours. The pain paralyzed me. I woke up in the middle of the night and suddenly couldn't walk. My parents rushed me to the hospital. Test after test I was just getting worse and there was no end in sight. My dad couldn't handle it. He walked out. He had to get himself together. It didn't make him less of a man. My mom was didn't say he was a coward. She could barely keep it together too. He came back and she walked out. It didn't make her a coward either. Neither of them talked bad about the other. It was one of the few moments of my childhood I remember my parents supporting each other's pain.\n\nWhen he came back after he managed to calm himself and did his best to make me laugh through the pain. \n\nRecently as an adult, I also got very sick. I had sepsis and very close to dying. I was in fact on death's door.  Neither of my parents could handle being in the room for very long as I drifted in and out of consciousness. They were watching me die. They were in pain. They were freaking out and didn't want me to see that. My sister stuck with me the entire time. She didn't have to say why mom and dad weren't there. I remember her saying it's cause she got there first and I wasn't allowed extra visitors.\n\nParents have a right to be scared when their child is sick. He didn't stay away. He had to pull himself out to get himself together. Him being there at that moment did his daughter no good. Neither did his wife telling his daughter he's a coward. \n\nI say NAH. I also understand his wife's reaction though I don't agree with hurting her daughter. My mom has a habit of doing the same so I'm thankful that as my worst she's refrained from it.", " If you can\u2019t cry for your daughter then who can you cry for?", "I\u2019m with you on this one, ESH.\nDad was hit with fight or flight instinct in the moment - THAT did not make him an asshole.  He went back the next stay and I\u2019m hoping is now visiting as much as he physically can.  Again, being afraid and struggling himself does not make him an asshole.\nHowever what makes him an asshole is posting AITA and making this about his feelings and whether his wife is being fair to him or not.  Grow the fuck up.  You had a moment of human weakness, own it and focus on supporting your daughter AND your wife!\nAnd his wife is an asshole because they should be supporting each other in this moment and not pulling each other down - telling him off was OK in her emotional state, but shitting on him to the child is asshole behaviour. \nBoth of you need to sort your shit out and be there for each other and your daughter.", "I had to scroll a long time for a comment such as this, thank you for posting this.", "I give his wife a pass.  She's distraught as well having her daughter in the hospital, and then OP compounds that by bugging out and leaving her all alone to take care of their daughter.", "This! People don't know how they will react until they're in that exact situation. Him crying in front of his daughter could have scared her even more than she probably already is. \n\nOP - I'm sorry you're daughter isn't well & I hope she makes a full recovery soon!", "Everyone calling this guy an AH only read the title and not the description. OP went back but his wife undermined any attempt at making the situation better for all of them.", "It's a tough situation, but I'm going with ESH. You should have been there for your daughter. Your wife should not involve your daughter.", "Yep.  My youngest brother is terrified of hospitals.  People get that he needs to take a break to clear his head now and then, but he still *shows up* when someone needs him.  Because if he's scared, how are *they* feeling, right?

During my seizures, I broke my back, had countless shoulder disclocations, broken ribs and collapsed lung, and so much more.", "Exactly. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being emotional in front of her and the family. Hell, if you are feeling overwhelmed take 10-30 mins away, go get a coffee or something and compose yourself and then get your ass back in there to support her.", "I'm sorry your parents failed in that.", "It doesn't look like that to me OP is definitely TA but I don't think it's self absorption as much as not knowing now to handle overwhelming emotions, we all get stuck in fight flight freeze from time to time and OP  went flight, it sucks, but it's a normal human response, be kind to yourself OP but also work on yourself and make sure that you can grow from thes and do better", "When your daughter is crying because she thinks her dad doesn't care enough about her to be there when she needs him, telling her that he is just a coward is a kindness to both of them.", "My younger brother od'd and was in the icu unconscious for 9 days. I spent the first three days there going home to shower, but sleeping there. Then it was every waking moment until he was awake. The doctors did not know if he would live. Said he was only going through the motions because his heart just kept ticking. 7 years later, he did it again but worse. This time I got to the er right after him. He was dark purple and the noises coming from him still haunt me. They flew him out thar time. They told me that it is unlikely that he would survive long enough to make it to the new hospital a 30 minute chopper ride away. I did the same thing that I did the first even though it was 45 minutes from home rather than 3 minutes.\n\n\nIt was my little brother, man. I had to be there no matter how much I did not want to be there.\n\n\n\nCurrently, he is living his best life. Sober since that OD. A great job. Married with a new kid. A house.  Everything anyone could want... and he is happy.", "Absolutely! My dad gets really freaked out around anything medical, he\u2019s afraid of needles and germs and blood\u2026 it\u2019s a lot. However, even through all of his fears he has shown up for me. Yes, even when it\u2019s super hard! \n\nHe will politely excuse himself if he gets overwhelmed or dizzy, but he is there because, he loves me more than he hates the many discomforts and stresses of a super sick child and a hospital. He and my mom have always shown up, and I am so grateful for it. It makes me feel so loved and special to know he pushed himself so he could be there for me. I feel so blessed! I can\u2019t imagine if he just ran away\u2026 \ud83d\udc94\n\nIt\u2019s all about the effort and acknowledgment that I am/was going through something very difficult and terrifying for me too! I fully agree, and that is what is so frustrating about OP. He didn\u2019t even try, he just freaked out and bailed\u2026 and didn\u2019t go back once he calmed down. Like, come on dude, you didn\u2019t even try\u2026 I\u2019m happy that her mom was with her at least! I genuinely hope his daughter is okay too.", "Awww thank you!", "I'm sorry about your son's experience, however in my family's experience an inpatient stay of a few days or longer is different than a night in the ER. My son spent about 20 days in the hospital last year. As a parent, there were days when I had to suck it up and power through, but if I tried to do that for the entire time I would have burned out. It sounds like OP has really fucked it up so far, but there's still time for him to step up and support his daughter and I hope he finds a way to do that.", "This happened to my nephew who I raised as well.

I mean they are both AHs but definitely not \u201cstoic.\u201d \n\nI think once you get a few downvotes people just downvote. Most likely men didn\u2019t like that I said women deal with this stuff better and others didn\u2019t like that I disagreed that it was not stoicism. They probably got more mad when I quoted the definition.\n\nEDIT:\n\nMight have been bringing up my wife. Who had to be stoic to not scare the shit of our son. On the same chemo at the same time. Not showing her fear to him. I\u2019ll take the downvotes gladly.", "If daddy isn't showing up, he's not showing up.

That is one less thing to worry about.", "No. She's saying \"you're allowed to feel shitty that your dad isn't here for you.\" I promise the kid was already feeling shitty about it. Mom validated that and proved that no matter what, she will always be there for the daughter. Daughter needs a strong validating presence, not an excuse-making wishy washy toxically positive one.", "Thank you. Not everyone is made of steel. Everyone deals with things differently. Maybe tomorrow mom can\u2019t deal and dad is able to. \nSometimes I hate the judgemental jerks on Reddit.", "Ugh dude....I'm sorry for what you are dealing with. It is understandable that seeing your daughter in that state would be more overwhelming than words can describe. It's completely human to not be able to handle things like that, and it would have been ok if you needed to leave the room to gather yourself. But, to leave the hospital. \n\nI really don't want to say yta. I was diagnosed with a progressive and terminal disease when I was 7, my parents were told I likely wouldn't see age 13. I had right heart catherizations and got central lines (both required anethesia), and at age 9 I had open heart surgery. I knew how scared both my parents were. My dad had this coin (penny I think) encased in some kind of stone (I want to say marble), he showed it to me after my open heart. He ran his fingers over it so much that the edge rounded, it was a squared off sharp edge before my surgery. From age 9/10 to about age 14/15 I was going under anesthesia to either replace my central line (my body kept rejecting it, this is not normal for central lines, in which i had to rush to the er to get an IV placed while waiting to get another one placed) or for another right heart cath, about every 3 months. That doesn't include all the other tests I went for (about every 3 months and eventually about every 6 months). That doesn't include the time I lost my central line whole visiting my cousin in Italy. And whatever else happened that I don't actually remember \n\nHere's the thing, despite me knowing how scared they were....they never showed it. Their level of fear and anxiety was never greater than mine. Looking back, that helped me be able to focus on things like, I was getting my first dog after my surgery instead of after all our cats died (which would have been around age 16). Despite having talks with them about the seriousness of what I was dealing with, their strength when around me was what made me not as scared as I could, and probably should have been. I have only realized this as an adult and looking back. I honestly don't know if I would have done as well, been as confident as I was or anything had they been that scared. \n\nAgain, I can completely understand how unbelievably overwhelming and scary it would be for you to see her like that. How impossible it is to keep from playing out the worse case scenarios in your head. Again, needing to step away from her for a moment to break down, be scared, and pull yourself together would have been perfectly OK, and is what you need to do here on out. Leaving the hospital was a bad, bad move. I'm sure you didn't mean it, but you abandoned your daughter. I am having a hard time saying yta though because this is truly a situation that is beyond being an ah or not.\n\nYour wife on the other hand, is an ah. She should have never told your daughter you are a coward. She needed to support you and tell her that you are having a hard time, that you love her, that you are and will be there for her. That you allowed your fear to overtake you and it overwhelmed you, but it's ok, because you are stronger than that and you are there for her.\n\nDon't be to mad at your wife though. She did and said some very hurtful things, but I am.sure she is just as scared and worried as you are. She also needed you as much as your daughter does, and she probably felt like you abandoned her too. DO NOT allow your fear, your grief, your desperation to drive a wedge between you and your wife. You daughter needs both of you, and you need each other. \n\nApologize to both of them. To your wife, remind her it's ok to be weak sometimes, but she doesn't have to be alone in being the strong one. Both of you be the strong ones for your daughters sake. Take turns breaking down and holding each other. Allow each other their moments, and allow your daughter to be scared as well as brave. Being brave together, is much easier than carrying the weight of the world by yourself. If you find yourself overwhelmed, step out of the room. Go get a soda, or something to eat, take a walk.arounf the halls, go talk to a nurse. Nurses are there for.the family as well as the patient (just don't keep her from doing her job) they will help support you to an extent. But after you take a moment, you pull yourself together and go back in and be next to your daughter and your wife. You let your wife go take her walk, go get her soda. Be honest with your daughter. Tell her your scared and worried, that you love her, that together you can be brave for each other. Take it from someone who was the child laying in the hospital bed, it's ok to be weak in front of her, as long as you don't leave her. \n\nI am sorry for what your family is going through. All the happy and healing vibes to all three of you. Please, do not allow yourself to be consumed by this mistake. Learn from it, and don't repeat it. Also please, you and your wife at least, please go get counseling. Individually and together. One of the absolute worse things you can do for your daughter right now is to allow what she is going through to tear you apart. But you can't fake things being ok, it will show. Get help, be strong but remember that it's ok to be and feel helpless and not know what to do. Just do it together.\n\nEdit to Add: IDK what's going on with your daughter.

It's OK to cry in front of your child as long as you explain why you are crying \"I'm crying because I am having a hard time seeing you in pain, etc\"   Basically he should have given the speech as opposed to expecting mom to give it.\n\nOr you know.....go to the bathroom and cry in a towel.   OR go to the cafeteria to get a cup of coffee.   OR go to the giftshop and get her a plushie.   He had lots more options than mom did when she lost her temper.", "Explain, how telling the truth without name calling is gaslighting?", "Oh yea as a kid hearing how my dad is *scared* would definitely help me calm down \n\nNOT", "Maybe I\u2019m not understanding your comment? I read it as saying you think mom should not have told the kid the truth. \n\nMom is not required to keep Dad\u2019s secrets, nor is she required to sugarcoat the truth. I probably would have stayed on the side of polite and said something like, \u201cDad is having a hard time and can\u2019t be a good parent right now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "Yes! Wenn mein Vater was dying in the hospital, I ran to the bathroom furthest away and hyperventilated badly and cried. Someone even knocked because they were concerned outside. I went back and made a joke to him about me losing my orientation in this big halls and needing time for finding my way back. I don't know if he believed me. But I was there.", "Agreed. Degrading a parent to a child is just wrong. Mom wasn\u2019t thinking of the daughter, but was thinking of herself and a way to hurt Op. Op is an asshole for running away and not showing up though. It\u2019s ok to cry in front of your kids. It\u2019s ok to be broken in front of your kids. It is not ok to abandon them and it is not ok to talk badly towards a parent. ESH.", "As someone who has been the person in the hospital, we do understand. Of course it sucks because visits is what makes it bearable, but we also can see the pain and worry in peoples eyes and understand why they need to stay little time sometimes. The main thing is hopefully she knew you loved her and knew you were there as much as could.", "There might be a more neutral way to do this, but it leans too closely towards everyone in the family pandering to OP.\n\n\"Dad's just having a hard time\" is the sort of thing that undercuts the hard time the daughter is having. And implies everyone else needs to place OP's feelings as the priority.\n\nThere are times to give people gentleness. There are also times to be harsh.  I think calling OP a coward was relatively toned down harshness.\n\nHe's a major asshole right now and acknowledging that can be a healthy thing. We don't have details, but we DO know OP is seriously failing to be any kind of support to his daughter.\n\nMaybe we should call a coward a coward in some situations.", "So, for mom has to face it and coddle her husband????? The bar is low.", "The mom is probably very scared as well.", "Fuck that noise. She's 14, not 9. She would see through that sugar-coated nonsense.", "I\u2019m sure there\u2019s only so many times a person can make excuses like this, unfortunately.", "So dad shouldn't have to put the effort into being there for his sick child, but mom should have to put the effort into covering for her cowardly husband? Nah, the double standard doesn't work. If dad can be an absent deadbeat, mom can be brutally honest.", "I'm genuinely curious about that. Why mom shouldn't be truthfull?\n\nI had an amazing dad but he was a lousy husband. My mom had the right to be so angry about him because his choices made our lives a living hell. 26 years after his death, I'm still fixing mistakes he made. I love him. Always will. But he had his flaws, thats all. I'm glad she didn't sugarcoat him for me just because his dead. But  oh boyyyy everyone else did. \n\nWhen it's the right moment to tell your kid \"listen, your dad did this this and this\"?", "I don't know that mom owes it to polish off her husband's turd behavior, because her CHILD is HOSPITALIZED and she's dealing with her kid's serious medical condition. She does not have space to make him look better for his kid because she's already dealing with her own feelings and with her kid's- to own up to/explain/ APOLOGIZE for his actions is HIS job, not hers.", "> Should she be given an impression that her illness is so terrible that it is understandable her dad is too scared to stay with her?\n> \n> Or should she be told the problem isn't bad enough to justify his running away and that he is being a coward?\n\n\nimo, saying that he's a coward IS telling her that her illness is so terrible that people are scared of it. There has to be some more comforting way of explaining it.", "When my son had to have an MRI, he had to be fasted for 6 hours prior to sedation. All day all me or my husband could do was try to soothe him knowing he was so hungry and tired from screaming because he was hungry. And then come time for sedation, the way his tired little 4 month old face stared at me, looking scared as the sedative started to take effect. I got back out to my husband and, even though he was also stressed and upset he just held me when I finally let myself break down for a few moments.\n\nHe had his moments too for those couple of days at the hospital. But he held it together those few days much better than I did and I'll forever be grateful for how steady he was throughout that whole experience.\n\nAnd. Fortunately, his MRI came back clear", "Yours is the only reasonable response worth reading on this whole topic. You clearly have experience dealing with a similar situation. I'm glad you could give some useful and validating tips for this dad.", "It IS shitty because the problem with saying it isn't \"oh no, poor OP is having his reputation ruined.\" The problem is that telling his daughter that makes it more stressful for the daughter. Mom needs to think of some more reassuring way to talk about it, or just think up a lie.", "It's his friend's brother, not his son, so not \"parental\". Above & beyond.", "I also don't think it's about protecting dad's \"image\". Like you said, it's not involving the daughter in their relationship drama. I was super sensitive to that stuff as a kid. Luckily, when my mom couldn't be there for me due to her addiction issues, my dad didn't badmouth her. Ever. He just told me in an age appropriate way that my mom was unwell so she couldn't be there for me but she loved me. I get that the mom is going through a lot and I feel OP needs to deal with this and stay with his daughter. But I do not think the mom saying that helped the kid. Focus on the daughter and the parents should handle their problems without involving the daughter. I know when I was a kid I would be thinking 1) I feel physically terrible. 2) where's dad? 3) I hope mom and dad are okay. \n\nThat's really sad.", "Seriously. I\u2019m autistic and have anxiety and PTSD, I get overwhelmed and panicked easily. When there\u2019s an emergency, I go into 100%-focused-on-situation-management mode and do what needs to be done for those I love. When I can\u2019t delay my subconscious reactions any longer, I go deal with them on my own for a few minutes and come back as soon as I can to continue being who they need me to be. I\u2019d never even consider making them deal with what\u2019s happening plus my emotions or abandoning them when they need someone the most.", "I like this \"mom override\". \n\nI once likened it to trying to keep the knot together so we wouldn't slip off the end of the proverbial rope. Just keep tying knots in those tiny loose ends to keep them (and your sanity/emotions/etc) intact."]}
