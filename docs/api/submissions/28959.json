English is not my first language, so apologies for any errors. My wife is right around 6 months pregnant atm.\n\n  \nEarlier, she was indulging in some bbq ribs that I picked up on the way home. It was at her request as a late-night craving. She was sitting in a lounge chair and eating quickly (messy/sloppy) before returning to her school work she fell behind on (she returned to school at 26 to obtain her degree and I have been supportive). I was glad to make her slightly stressful week a bit better with the food she craved.\n\n  \nI had just sat down myself when she asked me to pass her the roll of paper towel, as she was all messy from the bbq sauce and wanted to check her e-mail. Now, the paper towels were way closer to her side of the room we were in (living/dining area) and I had literally just sat down. I told her no, to get them herself.\n\n  \nShe said it was awkward and annoying for her to get up from where she was sitting, with bbq sauce on her hands and stuff everywhere. She tends to be pretty messy in her day to day, and the area was cluttered up with her water bottle, her school stuff, books, clothing, random papers, etc.  \nI jokingly said \"Hah, well you didn't think that through, did you?\" in reference to not preparing for the messy ribs, and she got pissy about this, saying I was being an ass for no reason, and could I \u201cplease just pass her the fucking paper towels.\u201d \n\n  \nI was annoyed at this point, so I again said no - they're closer to you, I just sat down, get them yourself. I added, **maybe a bit too harshly**: You're pregnant, not disabled.\n\n  \nSo when she got up it was a bit too quick, and she bumped the table with all her crap precariously piled on it. With this, her cup of hot chocolate (that she made hours before) had spilled over the basket of clean laundry she had folded and left next to the chair, including my white work shirt which was on the top of the pile.\n\n  \nShe immediately started crying, and we ended up arguing. She insists it was my fault for not taking \"2 seconds\" to get up and pass her the paper towel. I suspect it's partially a hormonal reaction on her end. Though I admit this all could have been avoided if I just got her the paper towel, I still do NOT think it is my fault nor am I the AH. I pointed out that\n\n  \na) if it wasn't so messy around her, it wouldn't have happened that way. why wasn't the laundry put away, instead of in the basket on the floor? And why not take the hot chocolate to the sink if you didn't drink it?  \nb) laundry is going to be a major part of her life in just a few short months as she gets ready to become a mom, and getting so upset about an extra load isn't worth the energy she's spending\n\n  \nEspecially with a new baby and with school, she needs to be better organized and aware. I still think this is amostly due to her mess and being frustrated when she got up and knocked over the stuff. She says I'm TA for prioritizing sitting down over being supportive of her needs.  \nAITA?  \n", "created_utc": 1697370381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178do9d/aita_for_refusing_to_get_up_and_hand_my_wife/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound really petty and nasty, honestly. You opted to pick and tease at your wife instead of just handing her a fucking paper towel, then continued to kick her while she was down. \n\nYour dismissive attitude about her laundry duties is just gross.

She's working more than you, that's why the laundry, that's why the desk, that's why a lot of things, and you are shaming her for it instead of helping. It would have cost you nothing to hand her the paper towels. It cost her quite a bit, by your own admittance, and now she has additional stress on her because you can't admit you're in the wrong. Now she'll forever have the memory of her husband literally bullying her when she asked for a small, insignificant favor.

Your lack of understanding of how the changes in hormones and the shift in one's center of gravity due to a larger belly is willful ignorance.\n\nYou get to take a pass on the hard work of bringing the child into the world.

She is becoming a mom and you are becoming a dad she can easily not wash your clothes or make meals and lunches or socialize with you. You're basically telling her to do it alone. Get your behind up and do the laundry instead of trying to argue. Get your behind up and work together to how you will manage the schedule with the baby. It is a small thing but at the moment I'm sure she is thinking about how many excuses you're gonna have for not pitching it.

What if she had fallen over the laundry basket and injured herself and the baby? She is growing an entire human.

You said your wife didn't think things through, but clearly what you meant is that YOU didn't think things through, OP.\n\nShe's six months pregnant, which means her weight is very different from her baseline. Most women who are that far along need to use their hands to get up. Her hands were covered in BBQ sauce. So, were you unaware that your wife would likely need her hands to rise safely from her seat? Or did you not recognize that the BBQ sauce made using her hands precarious if not entirely impossible? Or did you not recognize that - being unable to use her hands - she'd be less stable getting up and risk bumping into whatever was nearby?\n\nYour snide comment about her area being \"messy\" because she hadn't put away the laundry -- WTF OP? Are you trying to say you're simply not capable of putting away the laundry yourself? I mean, she's already done the lion's share of the work (meaning, washing it, drying it, and folding it), and you can't be bothered to put it away yourself? Why not? And your follow up comment about how laundry is gonna be a big part of her life as a mother... again, WTF? You're going to be a father, OP, laundry is gonna be a big part of your life, too!  You make it sound like it's all on her, and for that alone, YTA.\n\nAs for her \"wasting\" energy over one load of laundry -- you're missing the point. The load of laundry is not the problem, OP. You are the problem.\n\nYou had just sat down, so what exactly was the harm of getting up again to get her the paper towels? All the crap you posted here (about her area being full of stuff, about her generally being messy) are all reasons you should've just gotten up and gotten her the effing paper towels.\n\nAgain, she's six months pregnant and needs her hands to get up. Her hands are covered with BBQ sauce. You should've gotten off your butt and given her the paper towels, even if they were slightly further away from you than her.

And this is where you choose to draw a line? napkins? ...but okay, that could be excusable,  you had a long g day too I assume, but when sh\\*\\*t happened why in the world are you stubborn and argue about it when you see she got emotional? Why not just say sorry honey, let me help you clean this up ? And you're still focusing on \"your truth\" instead of just being there for her at this stressful time ? \n\nAnd that bit about laundry being a big part of her life now? It'll be a big part of your life too bro, why didn't you just take the basket to put away the clothes before sitting down, if  you are so perfectly organized? I am sorry, but you're talking about yourself as some kind of hero for bringing her food while she studies and supporting her studies, but those are pretty normal stuff to do, partners support each other in such situations, but running to rant to reddit about napkins is hardly supportive of your pregnant wife.", "YTA\n\n1) pregnant women want what they want, it is what it is.\n\n2) ribs are extremely messy on the best of days, they\u2019re delicious but again messy, especially if they\u2019re not dry run they\u2019re sauce based which apparently these were.\n\n3) your wife, for whatever reason was eating these ribs in a place surrounded by stuff, and she\u2019s pregnant which makes getting around difficult.

So she just naturally has more time for it", "You get it for anyone who asks in that situation, they know their hands are messy, they know they don\u2019t want to touch things, the vast majority of people only ask for help when they need it.", "yeah and getting up from the chair with sticky hands could mean mess all over the upholstery and any items she needed to move\n\nplus by 6 months there's a good chance she was in pain especially in her hips or back, which could get a lot worse in the next few months and does depend a great deal on how and how much she moves while pregnant\n\nand OP spoke to her in a really nasty way and seems to have a bad attitude that all the extra laundry etc is going to be her responsibility -  so she'd better get used to it now? excuse me?", "Pregnant women need to be careful but yes, they can lift things. I worked out, with weights, all through my pregnancies and it was not only dr approved but encouraged. Not carrying a laundry basket with gigantic stomach is its own challenge but it\u2019s not because we can\u2019t carry heavy things. Honestly, once you\u2019re pregnant with your second you\u2019re still going to be hauling around your first kiddo anyway unless they\u2019re much older!\n\n(Not to be rude but this is incorrect and I want people to know exercise during pregnancy is okay and encouraged!)", "Wtf are you smoking OP? YTA big time\n\nFt School is the same if not more hours then work. \n\nPart time work ON TOP of that (which you can\u2019t even handle yourself). \n\nAnd you assume she is in charge of all the housework because he was assume that she\u2019s home not doing anything. So I doubt you really help out here as much as you think you do.\n\nAnd now pregnant- which is a major medical event. Extremely exhausted, hormones running through her body, her body in pain, her body bigger, and harder to move around.\n\nThere is so much homework research and studying that she hast to do for school. There\u2019s so much mental energy and work done into running a household and handling all the chores in addition to physically doing the chores, and it\u2019s exhausting and mentally draining to be pregnant. You don\u2019t have to deal with any of that bullshit and yet you don\u2019t seem to help her.\n\nSo while she\u2019s juggling three major responsibilities- You only have one of these responsibilities and refused to help your wife at home.", "Sounds like you work hard, long hours and are tired. \n\nBut she's pregnant AND doing  full time school, even at home, AND works part-time. That's hardly nothing, that is quite a bit too - and the weariness of pregnancy is a real thing - and new parenthood will be even more. You are making some assumptions about 'who does the laundry' that are gonna really cause your little family trouble. And the fact that you're so annoyed, and only wanting to think about what your rights are on small things, is not going to help at all.\n\nTo be fair, maybe she's making incorrect assumptions about who should do what, too. You guys need to really work things out, maybe with help/counselling. Rather than us decide which of you is the AH.", "You do realise full time school is 30hrs a week plus part time job that\u2019s roughly 40hours a week minimum. AND SHES PREGNANT SHE IS GROWING YOUR CHILD. What kind of math are you doing to think she has more time if she was studying when you were at home sitting down doing nothing? She\u2019s already washed, dried and folded the laundry you could easily have put it away. YTA op and you\u2019re going to have to help out a lot more once your babies here. When you\u2019re 6 months pregnant you can\u2019t get up as easily as you would if you weren\u2019t pregnant. You strap a watermelon to your stomach and do all of the chores she does and see if you can manage it as easily as you\u2019re making it out to be.", "So? She's 6 months pregnant AND still works while going to school. She's literally doing more work when you factor in the fact that being pregnant makes even the simplest of tasks harder. What kind of man/father doesn't recognize and empathize with their pregnant wife. She works more than you do.", "People who are working and studying from home are *at work* or *at school*.  While she saves on a commute to school, she's *not* available to clean during her classes, and frankly needs time to do her coursework too.  Full time schooling isn't kidding about being full time.\n\nAnd how did you expect her to get up from that lounge chair, while pregnant, without touching something with her bbq hands?  She needed the paper towels to even be able to stand.", "No, she doesn't. You just dump it on her while accusing her off being messy and implying she's lazy. Do your own laundry and grow up, because a baby coming means you need to start doing a lot more around the house too. Not just leaving everything on her because you work.\n\nYta btw", "Wait. She's a FULL TIME student who ALSO works PART TIME while also being pregnant (which is a 24/7 kind of thing). WTF kind of math are you doing that says YOU work less than she does? Full time student + part time worker is definitely more than 45-50 hours a week. So why is she doing more than you, OP?", "What excuse are you planning on using when she\u2019s doing full time infant care? Time to start pulling your weight at home. \nStop expecting your wants to be catered to and not lifting a finger in support of your wife. If you\u2019ve got time to moan and complain on Reddit, you\u2019ve got time to do the laundry.", "Weekends? And you do realise her day will be much more than school and part-time work? Taking care of a baby is full time work which you should be helping with. Don't make excuses.", "do you realise full time of school is at least 40 hours? if she's taking 4 courses/paper, usually the recommended amount of time spent on each one is about 10 hours per week, including lectures, extra readings, assignments prep, etc. not to mention extra time spent commuting or getting ready for school if that's what she does. and even more hours spent if assignments/exams are due. i imagine her work is at the very least 10 hours per week, likely closer to 20 depending on your country. \n\nso... that's far more than your \"45 - 50 hours a week.\" AND she's pregnant??? AND she's doing all this extra stuff? while you can't be assed to get her *paper towels* because she needs them??? \n\nmy god i just hope for her sake and the child's sake that you are going to drastically step up (like, you're not even at the bare minimum right now) when the baby is born. i feel so sorry for your wife", "She is PREGNANT so she actually has less time for everything and she's going to school? You're such a loser for and I hope she sees this and wakes up to how horrible you are", "Man you new age assholes are something else. Homie, shes home all day taking classes online while he's actually working. Yeah, she will be doing the house chores, its only fair.", ">WTF kind of math are you doing that says YOU work more than she does?\n\nBoy math: it only counts as work if you make money doing it.", "This guy makes me sick and big reason why I don\u2019t trust almost any man to have a child with.", "Just because she\u2019s home she\u2019s still working 40+ hours a week at school. That is not time to be doing home chores. That\u2019s time to be studying and doing her schoolwork so she can get her degree. She also works on top of that. \n\nMan, you new age assholes are something else - you expect everybody to do everything while you sit at your computer, playing games and not putting any effort into society."]}
