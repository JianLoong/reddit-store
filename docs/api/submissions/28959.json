English is not my first language, so apologies for any errors. My wife is right around 6 months pregnant atm.\n\n  \nEarlier, she was indulging in some bbq ribs that I picked up on the way home. It was at her request as a late-night craving. She was sitting in a lounge chair and eating quickly (messy/sloppy) before returning to her school work she fell behind on (she returned to school at 26 to obtain her degree and I have been supportive). I was glad to make her slightly stressful week a bit better with the food she craved.\n\n  \nI had just sat down myself when she asked me to pass her the roll of paper towel, as she was all messy from the bbq sauce and wanted to check her e-mail. Now, the paper towels were way closer to her side of the room we were in (living/dining area) and I had literally just sat down. I told her no, to get them herself.\n\n  \nShe said it was awkward and annoying for her to get up from where she was sitting, with bbq sauce on her hands and stuff everywhere. She tends to be pretty messy in her day to day, and the area was cluttered up with her water bottle, her school stuff, books, clothing, random papers, etc.  \nI jokingly said \"Hah, well you didn't think that through, did you?\" in reference to not preparing for the messy ribs, and she got pissy about this, saying I was being an ass for no reason, and could I \u201cplease just pass her the fucking paper towels.\u201d \n\n  \nI was annoyed at this point, so I again said no - they're closer to you, I just sat down, get them yourself. I added, **maybe a bit too harshly**: You're pregnant, not disabled.\n\n  \nSo when she got up it was a bit too quick, and she bumped the table with all her crap precariously piled on it. With this, her cup of hot chocolate (that she made hours before) had spilled over the basket of clean laundry she had folded and left next to the chair, including my white work shirt which was on the top of the pile.\n\n  \nShe immediately started crying, and we ended up arguing. She insists it was my fault for not taking \"2 seconds\" to get up and pass her the paper towel. I suspect it's partially a hormonal reaction on her end. Though I admit this all could have been avoided if I just got her the paper towel, I still do NOT think it is my fault nor am I the AH. I pointed out that\n\n  \na) if it wasn't so messy around her, it wouldn't have happened that way. why wasn't the laundry put away, instead of in the basket on the floor? And why not take the hot chocolate to the sink if you didn't drink it?  \nb) laundry is going to be a major part of her life in just a few short months as she gets ready to become a mom, and getting so upset about an extra load isn't worth the energy she's spending\n\n  \nEspecially with a new baby and with school, she needs to be better organized and aware.

She's working more than you, that's why the laundry, that's why the desk, that's why a lot of things, and you are shaming her for it instead of helping. It would have cost you nothing to hand her the paper towels. It cost her quite a bit, by your own admittance, and now she has additional stress on her because you can't admit you're in the wrong.

Your lack of understanding of how the changes in hormones and the shift in one's center of gravity due to a larger belly is willful ignorance.\n\nYou get to take a pass on the hard work of bringing the child into the world.

She is becoming a mom and you are becoming a dad she can easily not wash your clothes or make meals and lunches or socialize with you. You're basically telling her to do it alone. Get your behind up and do the laundry instead of trying to argue. Get your behind up and work together to how you will manage the schedule with the baby.

What if she had fallen over the laundry basket and injured herself and the baby? She is growing an entire human.

You said your wife didn't think things through, but clearly what you meant is that YOU didn't think things through, OP.\n\nShe's six months pregnant, which means her weight is very different from her baseline. Most women who are that far along need to use their hands to get up. Her hands were covered in BBQ sauce. So, were you unaware that your wife would likely need her hands to rise safely from her seat? Or did you not recognize that the BBQ sauce made using her hands precarious if not entirely impossible? Or did you not recognize that - being unable to use her hands - she'd be less stable getting up and risk bumping into whatever was nearby?\n\nYour snide comment about her area being \"messy\" because she hadn't put away the laundry -- WTF OP? Are you trying to say you're simply not capable of putting away the laundry yourself? I mean, she's already done the lion's share of the work (meaning, washing it, drying it, and folding it), and you can't be bothered to put it away yourself? Why not? And your follow up comment about how laundry is gonna be a big part of her life as a mother... again, WTF? You're going to be a father, OP, laundry is gonna be a big part of your life, too!  You make it sound like it's all on her, and for that alone, YTA.\n\nAs for her \"wasting\" energy over one load of laundry -- you're missing the point. The load of laundry is not the problem, OP. You are the problem.\n\nYou had just sat down, so what exactly was the harm of getting up again to get her the paper towels? All the crap you posted here (about her area being full of stuff, about her generally being messy) are all reasons you should've just gotten up and gotten her the effing paper towels.\n\nAgain, she's six months pregnant and needs her hands to get up.

It'll be a big part of your life too bro, why didn't you just take the basket to put away the clothes before sitting down, if  you are so perfectly organized?

It was a general statement which I responded to with another general statement to say that women *can* lift things and THEY ARE BOTH TRUE FFS. Some women can do heavy lifting and some can\u2019t. Their statement did not apply to every pregnancy nor did mine.\n\nWe\u2019re all adults here who can recognize that what is relevant to YOUR specific pregnancy is not necessarily relevant to someone else\u2019s and that two things can be true at the same time.

Acts of service are a love language, you may want to read up on that in order to develop that emotional bandwidth because you will need it to survive as a father - if you hope to be a good, supportive and loving father.\n\nBecause you had to go and force it, not only did her organized study chaos, like pens near her writing hand, books open to the correct page, any number of printed syllabus instructions on looseleaf become disturbed by the displacement of her mass from the couch, and likely fall into the pits of no return only to be tear stained by falling droplets of grease and BBQ sauce, you also seriously jarred her from her emotional space which would totally interrupt whatever higher computation train of thought she was in the middle of when she distractedly asked you for an assist.\n\nYou had just come inside from running errands, and still had enough momentum to get back up from the couch, get her the paper towels, and tell her it\u2019s last call for honey-dos: Does she need anything else before you sit down?

I have been accidentally ignored many times because receptionists just don\u2019t see me on the other side of the counter. And that is in a medical setting! Don\u2019t get me started on the rest of the world!", "Much better, I'm remarried to someone who actually likes me and is nice to me. :-) He just ran out and got juice boxes and snacks for my daughters birthday party this afternoon bc I forgot.", "Same at my house. We're also in the habit of asking the each other if he/she needs anything if one of us is heading down to the basement (where our tv is) -  like snack, drink, etc. Its just common courtesy to ask your partner if they need something.", "Ikr?  Why do women have to put down other women by sharing their experience of how it wasn\u2019t that hard for them?  Bully for you.  That means absolutely jack to someone else who didn\u2019t have that same glorious experience.  \ud83d\ude44", "Who isn\u2019t already lifting laundry baskets?", "It\u2019s actually okay to start lifting during pregnancy! Nothing extreme obviously, no one\u2019s hitting PR\u2019s. But you can start using lighter dumbbells and things as long as you have your doctors approval and you\u2019re using proper form.\nMany doctors are encouraging women who haven\u2019t historically exercised to start during pregnancy because it has so many benefits. No one has to use weights if they don\u2019t want to and it obviously becomes more difficult as your bump grows but as long as you\u2019re mindful of your body it\u2019s totally okay to start adding in some weights.\n\nI started this with my first and I ended my pregnancy stronger than when I started\u2014though my abs were obviously non-existent haha", "Some people are absolutely disabled by pregnancy.", "I spent 12 weeks straight vomiting *at least* 8 times a day from *mild* HG, and dropped down to less than 100lbs, and became anemic, it certainly felt like a disability, lmao.\n\nI still haven't fully recovered from it at 23 weeks, so everything *hurts* from all the muscle mass I lost.", "*You* weren\u2019t. Other people definitely are. I was pretty instantly a useless human between being sick and then being unable to move right well most people would think of.", "I\u2019ve had to use this line so many times when people insist on \u2018helping\u2019 me when really they\u2019re just making things more awkward (like forcefully taking a bag from me and leaving me unbalanced etc.)", "I was a field technician fixing copiers up until a week before I gave birth to my second. Carrying tools, parts, bending over, stooping, kneeling on the ground... The whole function of it. Pregnancy for the majority of us does not incapacitate us. \ud83d\ude44 Hell the more active you are leading up to delivery, the easier it is to give birth and recover.", "Except when it's his. THEN it's valid.", "Oh man, the number of times my sis has asked something and the person answers ME is infuriating. I once flat out told a server \u201cLook, every time you come over here, you ask me if SHE needs a refill or how her food is. But dude, she\u2019s the hostess of this meal and your tip is in HER hands, I\u2019m just her kid sister she\u2019s taking out to brunch\u2026\u201d\n\nI\u2019m still salty about the time someone called her my daughter too, I\u2019m five years younger than she is and I promise she LOOKS older. (She\u2019s rather proud of it actually, she was very baby faced as a teen and around 19 just kinda developed a more mature, womanly face and she LIKES it that way.) So because I\u2019m a shit I replied \u201cdude, that\u2019s my aunty\u201d and my bestie glared and said \u201cI RAISED her!\u201d \n\nWhich isn\u2019t really a lie\u2026 we met when I was 3 months old and she has definitely been an influence on my upbringing, xD", "Oh that\u2019s so wonderful! Thank you for cheering me up after reading this bleak post.", "I think that\u2019s why I felt like so much of a burden, my mom worked up until the day before she gave birth to me. Luckily for me, she was very understanding and listened to my concerns, and we were able to figure out the issue rather than just tell me I should be able to do the same.", "Right?! Everybody is different. Your experience can be different from pregnancy to pregnancy. I didn't have any problem doing physically demanding jobs during both pregnancies. \n\nMy best friend was in extremely good shape, way better than I was, but carrying laundry upstairs caused her so much pain she said it felt like her stomach muscles were ripping during her pregnancies.\n\nOp is self centered, lazy, and very snarky towards his wife. I can hear him now, \"She asked me to get her a drink of water, and all she's doing is sitting there breastfeeding for the last hour.\"", "I\u2019m not referring to the post. I\u2019m referring to the comment that it\u2019s ok for pregnant women to start working out and lifting during pregnancy. This is something my doctors say is only ok if you were already lifting before pregnancy and I think it\u2019s important to give caveats on advice that could hurt someone.", "Me! My partner does the laundry because i've had back pains since the start of second trimester. And he mostly did them before that also because of my work schedule and the laundry room being open when he's at home.\n\nThe OP is an asshole.", "OP. Apparently ever. Thats for the women folk, even if they are pregnant and in school, or taking care of a newborn.", "It\u2019s so funny, I was regularly exercising before pregnancy, but I actually couldn\u2019t lift laundry baskets without messing my back up. My body would over prepare for the weight of the basket and then it would throw my back out. Could lift tons of things way heavier, but not laundry baskets, those got scooted across the floor lol.", "I don\u2019t lift any laundry baskets, but that\u2019s because my washer and dryer are in the hallway right outside my room.", "OP", "OP", "The post OP, clearly.", "It\u2019s actually highly encouraged if you have a connective tissue disorder (like EDS) made worse by relaxin!", "Most people are not disabled by the *pregnancy*, they\u2019re disabled by a condition brought on by the pregnancy. Pregnancy itself isn\u2019t innately a disability, but it can cause other issues for sure.

Just because it applies to a small minority doesn't mean it's relevant for everyone else.", "A typical, healthy pregnancy is NOT disabling. While it is possible, it is not the norm.", "Some people are absolutely disabled in life but not every person. I was on strict bed rest with one of mine and the other two I still worked out everyday.", "The pregnancy induced dyspnea hit me hard and fast. Struggling to catch my breath made most activities pretty darn difficult.", "I used to find it infuriating. Like, how do you think I survive when you are not around.", "It is really depressing how often I hear about men like this. Of course women can be terrible partners too! I just hear stories about men who are abusive, or just straight up dislike their wife, on the daily.", "That\u2019s what true support and empathy looks like.  Glad you had that!", "It appears our doctors had different opinions. I had 3 different OB\u2019s, a PT, and a high risk OB all say it was safe for me to begin using weights in my first pregnancy. Barring any complications the latest research and recommendations seems to say that beginning to use light to moderate weights with appropriate modifications in pregnancy is safe.\n\n\nhttps://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/fitness/weight-training-while-pregnant/\n\nhttps://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/your-health/lifting-weights-while-pregnant\n\nIf you and your dr disagree that\u2019s fine. Everyone can talk to their own doctor and decide for themselves.", "\ud83e\udd23 true! OP is definitely TA here; I just don\u2019t understand people saying pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be lifting things like laundry baskets. In most healthy, normal pregnancies it just isn\u2019t a big deal. Both of mine were high risk, but due to the type of risk I didn\u2019t have any lifting restrictions for #1, and 30 lb limit for #2.", "I wish I'd known that during my pregnancies!

Both of those things are fairly common in pregnancy.", "I mean disabling is a spectrum. I\u2019m having a very healthy pregnancy and walking up a flight of stairs now is still much harder than it was when I wasn\u2019t 8 months pregnant.

And your experience is not necessarily their experience. You were cleared, and someone else (like me) wasn\u2019t cleared. I\u2019ve been on a weight limit of 15lbs since week 5. Everyone has a different experience and no one should be shamed for what they are told or what their experience is.", "Jesus are we gatekeeping pregnancy now? OP would still the AH in this situation.  Let\u2019s get our priorities straight.", "I think it really depends on the moment. Lifting may cause additional back problems, depending on the type of basket. Bending over, then standing up lifting was painful. Also, if she needs to carry them upstairs may be a balance issue. OP is TA, and really needs to help more. It\u2019s only going to get worse.", "I don't think that's the point. She chose not to lift it for a reason and we don't know that reason. Perhaps she was knackered and had work to do for school. People horse ride when pregnant and I think that is probably worse than lifting heavy things. People need to judge what they are comfortable with and I'm sure if she was comfortable doing it she would have done it.", "Oh yes. Pregnancy can jack all sorts of things because part of the prepping for birth process means making things more flexible internally.

I know the mesh was problematic for a lot of people but it makes sense that pregnancy and the aftermath was such a nightmare", "I had no complications during my last pregnancy, but had terrible pelvic pain.
