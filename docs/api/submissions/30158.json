Be ready for that to be unpleasant.", "Their financial situation isn\u2019t really your problem. Yea it would be nice if you could let them stay the 3 months but you don\u2019t have to. That\u2019s not your obligation also your sibling saying ur uncaring?? I don\u2019t get that. NTA", "Well your parents are wrong. You are not depriving them of anything. You are keeping your sanity.  Fish and guests have a 3 day rule.", "More than generous.", "Send this OP!!!!", "Exactly. I disagree with the people telling her that two weeks is good. They should be completely uninvited because of their attitude.", "Please tell me \u201dmoo point\u201d is a Friend\u2019s joke and not a typo\u2026", "My limit is 4 days. I\u2019d be a basket case after two weeks.", "This is what I got from this post also. \n\nIf OP hadn\u2019t written \u201c the child wasn\u2019t conceived in a responsible planned manner\u201d then I would be NTA. But this one line alone sounds like it is more about not wanting to show any support to OP\u2019s sibling rather than not wanting to host the parents.  \n\nBut, with that being said, 3 months is a long time", ">Your feelings on poor people having kids aside (and yikes lol)\n\n\n\nWhat feeling? Her sibling didn't plan well. \n\nAlso, given the cost of everything including raising children, no one should be playing around with that. No one. It is irresponsible to play around with raising children without thoughtful planning", "Highest hour of need? Overdramatic much? The sister is having a baby--not a life threatening operation. It's nice that mom and dad want to visit but 3 months??? If they truly need that much time they can look into a long term hotel suite or airbnb.", "Mother, not MIL!", "\"Do the parents have transport? \" ... Yes. They will use OP's car.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan'T tske the bus, because all the stuff they will ransack from OP's place to bring to the sibling will be to heavy to carry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe young family will need food, towels, ... And OP can buy some more.", "Agreed and make it clear it\u2019s a one-time offer. Visits to the baby aren\u2019t going to stop after the birth.
