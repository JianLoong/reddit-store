I mean we're not push overs... if that makes sense.... like sure we'll say sorry.... but we're not actually sorry.... or we might be sorry that someone is a total hoser. Lol", "Canadian. Here that is the polite thing to do. Even if you aren\u2019t in the wrong. \nKind of and \u201cI acknowledge that you are on happy with the situation even if you are at fault, \u2026.\u201d Mixed with a \u201c i empathize with your frustration\u201d  \nNot an actual apology/ admission of wrong doing.", ">Unless OP is in Canada, in which case every person involved probably apologized, as expected.\n\nI'm in Canada and I'd totally have said the same thing, ie \"sorry to kick you out\" but it would have been meant as a sympathetic, \"yeah I know it sucks, I sympathize that your party is over so soon\" and I would have been taken aback to be replied to in any way other than, \"No worries, we know our time was up, sorry to clear out at the last second.\" \n\nTo be told I was rude for actually expecting to be able to use the place at the time I booked, I would have turned snarky and let them know that no, it's not actually rude.", "Sadly we aren't actually that nice", "\"Im sorry for reminding you that you have absolutely shit time management skills.\"", "You mean trust a group of people that, with just 10 minutes left on their time, have not even started to break down and clean up?\n\nI wouldn't trust them either. They should have started to quietly break things down 20 minutes till their scheduled end time.", "It\u2019s because we don\u2019t use sorry like other English speaking countries. It\u2019s much more common to use it as a synonym for excuse me, as an umm word, or to express sympathy than as some sort of admission of guilt or apology.", "Would be strange if it was an admission of guilt. Apparently everyone at my grandma's funeral got together and lynched her.", "I call that being \"sorry about it\".", "Agreed. I am sorry often means I am sorry for the disagreement or discord between us. I am sorry you are upset. I am sorry you feel inconvenienced. I am sorry you are obviously unhappy or upset. Which can be totally legit even if we are the ones causing that feeling and unapologetically believe we are in the right.  Eg I need my spot on time but I am genuinely sorry that this upsets and conveniences you. \n\nTo be clear though there is nothing in the Canadian politeness rules stopping you from following up your \u201cI am sorry\u201d with one or more of the following silent thoughts: \n- \u201cthat you are a jack@ass\u201d \n\n- \u201cthat you can\u2019t tell time\u201d \n\n-\u201cthat you are in my way\u201d\n\n-\u201cthat I am so obviously right and you are so obliviously wrong\u201d\n\n-etc. \n\n\ud83e\udd2b\n\nI don\u2019t think saying I am sorry is a sign of weakness or being a doormat but I also don\u2019t think it is synonymous with kindness. They are very different things. :) \n\nHaving said that, I think OP was trying to be both polite and kind. She paid for her time and she needed her time. She wasn\u2019t in a position to wait but she also hated to interrupt. The other person was out of line and even if it was rudeness born out of embarrassment she was still in the wrong to be so snarky when all OP did was claim what she paid for.  \n\nNTA", "Sorry is such a reflex for me. Canadian here as well! \n\nThere's one lady I work with who's from Australia and she's told me \"Will you stop saying sorry? You haven't done anything to be sorry for.\" It's usually if I have to reach over her to grab a pen from the desk or something like that. \n\nI have to bite my tongue not to say, \"Sorry for saying sorry so much.\" Lol.", "Lol", "Uh...in that case, are Midwestern Americans also Canadian?", "Apparently, because we do the same thing in the UP. And when I travel to the Caribbean, I always get asked if I\u2019m Canadian.  Lol. Take it as a compliment!"]}
