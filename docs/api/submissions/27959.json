We knew what time we booked it for and we were cleaning up 30 minutes before our time was up. We told all the guests to start wrapping up and to help clean and take down their stuff (they brought lawn chairs, tents etc). We took all our garbage and threw it at the nearby bins and also separated out the recycling. We left before our time was up and before the next group even started coming.\n\nWhen you book an event, it's your job to be out by x time.

As long as you were polite I don\u2019t think this woman should have been upset with you. You weren\u2019t rushing her out, you were reminding her that the space would become yours in ten minutes.
