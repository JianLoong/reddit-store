He can't go calling you pet names and saying you're his business if you've said no. NTA at all and your friends can buzz off.", "NTA, he sounds like my ex-husband when I wanted to leave, the more I said no, the harder he tried. Sorry to say but you have to be brutal with this type of person, and if you lose a few friends in the process, well, you realise they\u2019re not really friends.", "Yeah he's not actually your friend, it's his way of getting close to you so he can get in your pants. There was only 1 way to deal with guys like that and you found it. NTA", "NTA some girls might like that kind of attention but not everyone. You.did.nothing.wrong.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like your friend really, REALLY wants to admit what he feels, but doesn't know how to go about it - so he's trying to integrate a relationship into the friendship by having little reactions like that. It's a manipulative tactic by nature, but is often done by people who feel very insecure in their emotions.\n\nIf he keeps trying it, you may need to sit him down proper and explain where your own head is at, so he knows how to feel and what expectations to set. This depends a lot on how aggressive he's being, of course (if he's being pushy or violent, I wouldn't put myself alone with him, for safety).", "NTA.  He sounds possessive and alarming.  Good riddance.  Red flags from him.", "NTA.\n\nRun.", "NTA you set a boundary and he ignored it. You were actually nicer then I would have been.", "Keep a rattle in your bag and if he ever calls you baby again, pull it out and start crying/calling him Daddy. See how fast he shuts up.

This also won\u2019t be the last time this guy does something like that.  Your best bet is to just not be friends with him.

When I was polite the first 100 times he didn\u2019t get the message.", "NTA. he brought this onto himself", "NTA. He humiliated himself putting on a macho display and acting like he owns you.

So, he took his crown and scepter and left. It's tough when attraction is a one-way street. But you aren't doing him any favors by letting him annoy you.

She has absolutely no obligation to fake laugh or teach him how to behave. Guys like this aren't cute or romantic, they're dangerous if they grow up thinking they are the main character and the random girl he picks is his love interest and it's all gonna be perfect just like a movie. And he need to learn how to behave near women, ffs he's SIXTEEN not ten.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: also tired of women being labeled as the \"mean\" girl because they said NO, because they refuse to engage with the \"sweet dude who cares for her\". She has no obligation, no interest, so he must live her alone PERIOD.", "A guy that doesn\u2019t know how to take no for an answer is gonna be trouble.  I can guarantee OP has said no to him multiple times before and yet he still tries to pull shit like that.  Everyone learns from a very young age to not do things that someone doesn\u2019t want you to do", "True! The amount of women I've given politeness too that I shouldn't have is unreal.  \n\nAlso let's not forget the non-binary folks, if they are boundary stomping they can get fucked.", "No explanation but this: So I told him to cut it off, and this isn\u2019t a movie cause he\u2019s giving me the ick. Well, everyone in the class laughed.\n\nThis is the part that didn't need to be in public -- someone she thought was a friend. Who is confused about their feelings etc. Like, if she just hates the guy, fine, but she described him as a friend.", "He's the one who made a big show though, he brought the class's attention upon himself.", "Why isn\u2019t there an age limit for posts?!?! ESH you\u2019re children and acted like it. Obviously he\u2019s not a friend because friends don\u2019t talk as condescendingly as you did about him in the first paragraph. Secondly yeah he\u2019s creepy and totally overstepped so he\u2019s also an AH. In all honesty though I\u2019m so glad my old ass doesn\u2019t have to deal with teenage drama anymore.", "NTA, he needs to learn that persistence and possessiveness is creepy and annoying, not cute. This is how he learns.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut even better: igbnore him, pretend to fail to see or hear him. DON'T answer him when he is inappropriate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd maybe ask for help from school admin, tell them to make him stop harassing you.", "NTA. Dont let anyone make you feel bad for setting boundaries.", "Ewwww wtf \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d NTA!!", "Does he wear a fedora and call you m\u2019lady? Dude is giving off major neckbeard \u201cnice guy\u201d vibes.  Run. Also NTA", "Your refusal to explain what happened increased his fear that someone hurt you.  He was worried about you and you disdain him for that???!", "NTA. Period. His behavior is creepy. If I were you I wouldn't call him a friend, because real friends don't make you feel the ick like that. He wouldn't take the hint, so you had to spell it out for him. Sucks for him for not getting the message when it was presented in a softer way, but some people are like that.\n\nThe thing I would worry about, though, would be retaliation. Some people (not to generalize, but it's usually male type people) feel the need for revenge when they think they've been humiliated like that. Hopefully that's not the case for you, but just to be safe, make people (including trusted adults) aware of the situation. Let them know this happened, and you're concerned about the fall out. Let your bosses at work know in case he shows up there. I realize this is probably being overly cautious, but this does happen to a lot of women and I don't want you to be one of them. Be safe.\n\nEdit: grammar and punctuation because I am my own worst critic", "NTA. It wasn't his place to do all that. You told him what's up. He DECIDED to take it as far as he went.", "I agree, and I do have to apologize for being so stupid. I do sometimes have moments where I don't really register at all.\n\nI read the whole damn thing. And my brain somehow 'forgot' momentarily I had read the first part. And then the comment was up was too late. Reread and realized I was most likely dropped as a child cuz she had warned him multiple times.\nFirst impression on reddit ever. I downloaded the app yesterday. 12 downvotes laterrr but i understand why they're there lol\n\nI changed the comment because I feel shame", "NTA. He tried to play the big hero and was embarrassing *you*. You told him to stop and instead of respecting that he doubled down. \n\nSome people believe that women should feel flattered and grateful for any positive attention that men try to give us, and that by not reacting that way we\u2019re being assholes. \u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d Also, girls are often raised to \u201cbe nice\u201d and not hurt other peoples feelings, even at the expense of their own comfort and safety. It\u2019s so deeply ingrained in us that women have even lost their lives when someone took advantage of this way of thinking to lure them into an unsafe situation. I know that seems like an extreme comparison to your experience, but they both go back to the same concept. Women are taught from childhood that men\u2019s feelings are our responsibility, and that we should prioritize them over our own, at all costs. \n\nThat\u2019s the type of logic your friends are using when they say you\u2019re an asshole for embarrassing him. You gave him *two* chances to stop before you escalated things. Ask those friends why it\u2019s ok for him to make you feel uncomfortable and embarassed and harassed just because he likes you, but it\u2019s not ok for you to make him feel embarassed by standing up for yourself.", "NTA he\u2019s a loser, we need to bring back bullying icl", "NTA..\n\nOP, your \u201cfriend\u201c Jason was trying to set himself up as your white knight going to rescue his fair lady..

He didn\u2019t like having his romantic dreams shatter, he got angry, and left. But that\u2019s his own fault, not yours.\n\nRejection sucks and it hurts, but that\u2019s his issue to deal with. You have nothing to feel bad about, not at all. Your friends are the AH\u2019s for not getting you just weren\u2019t interested, period.  \n\n\nJason didn\u2019t want to be your friend, he wanted you to be his GF or nothing at all and he\u2019s made his choice and his humiliation is his alone to deal with.", "NTA\n\nThat is humiliating", "NTA but also what the fuck did I just read", "That looser needed a reality check.

The only thing he deserves is her disdain.", "It's not that she disdains him for being worried, it's that he was over the top, over dramatic, and tried to lay some weird ass creepy claim on her as if she were his property. Not to mention, he automatically assumed that someone had assaulted her, instead of just calmly asking what happened.\n\nThe fact that she told him it was none of his business, combined with the fact that this seems to be an ongoing issue, it's pretty reasonable that she snapped.", "When someone is consistently pushing your boundaries, especially in public, which is quite a manipulation tactic, saying whatever you need to say in order to get someone to back off is not unreasonable. He made her feel extremely uncomfortable in front of everyone, she told him to knock it off, she told him it was none of his business, and he continued to push. At some point, people just lose all patients, and reach their limit.", "Ok, so let's start with setting the record straight - you are not friends with this guy. You quite obviously dislike him. \n\nAs to your AH status? That depends - have you previously told him, in private, that he makes you uncomfortable and you're not interested in being his girlfriend?", "Bro thinks he\u2019s in Ouran host club \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "NTA. Your friend can ask you what happened, but you had every right to stand up for yourself and let him know it wasn't his business. Once he started making a scene and calling you baby and his business when you had never given him the right to do so, too bad for him. Ignore your classmates. It wasn't his business. You didn't ask for his interference and let him know that. Maybe you can teach your classmates about not inserting themselves into someone else's business, not listening when told to leave something alone and that you can't force someone to feel the same way you do. Just because someone feels that another person is their business, it doesn't mean they really are. They might only embarrass themselves by trying to make someone else \"their\" business.", "Be wary of this guy. He sounds like he could become serious trouble.
