He humiliated himself when he called you baby and made the assumption that you were his property.", "NTA\n\nIf he's upset, good.  He needs to learn boundaries.  You are not his girlfriend.  Yes is good that he's concerned, but that's beyond concern.  He brought everyone else into it.  Not cool.\n\nGetting that heated over something you told him not to worry about is pretty off.  I wouldn't worry too much about his feelings there.  I would worry more about shutting down the idea that he has a chance with you though. The possessiveness is pretty concerning.", "NTA. You didn't humiliate him; he humiliated himself. You're not his baby, you don't belong to him, and he was being overly presumptuous and possessive.", "NTA you do not owe any male politeness or protection from hurt feelings if they make you uncomfortable or disrespect your boundaries.", "NTA. He needs to learn boundaries", "NTA\n\nI'm assuming you've told him you're not his girlfriend before that. It's not your fault if homie refuses to accept the truth of the situation. If he wasn't being a possessive creep, you wouldn't have had to shut him down so hard. You tried to redirect, and he didn't wanna drop it... That's on him.", "We can always think back on ways we could have handled situations better.  He put you on the spot, though.  He created the scene and you just reacted because he was making you uncomfortable.  NTA", "NTA. Sometimes you just have to chop it off at the knees.", "His pride is not your responsibility.", "NTA that\u2019s icky behavior dude. glad you weren\u2019t being a pushover and put him in his place", "NTA.  \n\nSet a boundary and run.", "I would Jason might have an unhealthy obsession, and I would begin to ease away from that relationship.", "NTA you have some real \"nice guy\" shit going on there. Wouldn't be surprised if he complains about how you put him in the friend zone behind your back. Good luck.", "NTA the guy clearly doesn't care about your boundaries. It reminds me of the \"old days\" when we as kids were told that when little Jimmy punches you or pulls your hair it was because he \"likes\" you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNO. It's abuse and controlling. Good for you standing up for yourself. I hope this ends his obsession with you but if not, maybe take it to the principal for harassment?", "NTA he needed to learn eventually that you're  not interested in him.", "NTA. Sure, you could have handled it better and talked after class, but he can't be talking to you that way either. If yta then, so is he.

You told him what you wanted in answering the question about your injury. He kept pressuring you and trying to be possessive-protective of you and you do not want that.", "Nta he made this happen and its important to have boundaries when people constantly push them.  If he wants to be your friend maybe in gime he ll realise his mistake .", "WTF? Main character syndrome is right, this guy's weird. He can't go calling you pet names and saying you're his business if you've said no. NTA at all and your friends can buzz off.", "NTA, he sounds like my ex-husband when I wanted to leave, the more I said no, the harder he tried. Sorry to say but you have to be brutal with this type of person, and if you lose a few friends in the process, well, you realise they\u2019re not really friends.", "Yeah he's not actually your friend, it's his way of getting close to you so he can get in your pants. There was only 1 way to deal with guys like that and you found it. NTA", "NTA some girls might like that kind of attention but not everyone. You.did.nothing.wrong.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like your friend really, REALLY wants to admit what he feels, but doesn't know how to go about it - so he's trying to integrate a relationship into the friendship by having little reactions like that. It's a manipulative tactic by nature, but is often done by people who feel very insecure in their emotions.\n\nIf he keeps trying it, you may need to sit him down proper and explain where your own head is at, so he knows how to feel and what expectations to set. This depends a lot on how aggressive he's being, of course (if he's being pushy or violent, I wouldn't put myself alone with him, for safety).", "NTA.  He sounds possessive and alarming.  Good riddance.  Red flags from him.", "NTA.\n\nRun.", "NTA you set a boundary and he ignored it. You were actually nicer then I would have been.", "Keep a rattle in your bag and if he ever calls you baby again, pull it out and start crying/calling him Daddy. See how fast he shuts up. THAT would be humiliating him. You put him in his place; which is NOT yo body.", "NTA he reads too much fanfiction, and doesn't realize that enjoying it on the web is one thing but it doesn't translate well to real life. lol. do we still use cringe? cuz that was cringe. lol", "NTA. Your injury is none of Jason\u2019s business unless he was a direct cause of it, even then how your doing would still be none of his business. Also, he is being turbo cringe on main, and that\u2019s always terrible.", "NTA. You need to nip this in the bud before Lloyd Dobler Junior here does something REALLY stupid.", "I mean, she owes him exactly zero explanation, she did not make anything worse."]}
