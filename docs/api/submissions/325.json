He talked openly of the future he wants for us, dismissed my concerns about religion, and even crossed my physical boundaries (which he eventually stopped after me telling him multiple times to). When I eventually reciprocated, he said he didn't want to be w/ me b/c we are of different religions (something he told me wasn't an issue but apparently now was) and has no idea why he said those things, that he feels really bad, but that he can't and won't do anything. We decided to stay friends. Since then he hasn't acted like just a friend--he still said he is in love w/ me, he doesn't know how he will get over me, I'll never find someone who loves me as much as he does, etc. I didn't know what to make of it and didn't know how to ask about it.\n\n\\~ 4 months ago, we moved to different cities. Since the move, we\u2019ve been planning a trip for me to visit. Since he still wasn\u2019t behaving as a friend (still expressing romantic interest, the night before the trip, I approached him about the things he was saying. I mentioned since he was saying these things everyday to me, it might be a good idea to attempt a relationship. He immediately rejected me and told me that he doesn't know why this keeps happening, why a friendship w/ him isn\u2019t enough for me, and started crying b/c \"how can we be friends if you keep wanting more???\" I was angry, I called him out for his recent behaviour and his past behaviour--both leading me on to think he wants more. He said that my getting angry was making him anxious, that maybe it wasn't a good idea for me to visit him tomorrow and he could reimburse my flight ticket. I, in disbelief b/c this was a 4 month plan in the making & my flight was tomorrow, asked him if he was serious, if he actually didn't want me to come, if he was just speaking in the heat of the moment, if he actually would reimburse my ticket, etc. He stopped responding to me altogether while I tried to get a-hold of him and gauge the situation.\n\nThe next day, I still hadn't received replies. I decided to go b/c I hadn\u2019t received anything from him other than his brief statement during our argument, b/c it is unlike him to cancel concrete plans, b/c this was a trip \u00a0we struggled and planned for 4 MONTHS on student budgets, b/c it was a trip \u00a0I worked tirelessly to accommodate into my medical school schedule, and b/c we wouldn't see each other for another 6 months after this. Once I got there, he told me he was serious about cancelling and refused to see me. He was \u201ctoo anxious\u201d b/c I got mad at him, b/c I keep asking for more than a friendship and b/c I brought up his past mistakes. I ended up sleeping in the airport. AITA for not listening to him when he said maybe I shouldn't visit him?\n\nTLDR: BFF left me in an airport after a fight b/c he was too anxious @ my anger, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667234384, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yih4fg/aita_for_making_my_bff_leave_me_in_an_airport/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to distance yourself from him. NTA but you really need to learn more about red flags and pay attention to them. They were evident from the beginning.", "You are NTA, but you also need to read the writing on the wall: This person can\u2019t even sort our their own feelings, and there\u2019s no way in hell that they can possibly consider yours. \n\nThis guy doesn\u2019t know which way is up. He\u2019s so wrapped up in religion and other nonsense that you can\u2019t possibly depend upon him for anything. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that you both have feelings for each other, but his actions have made it clear that there\u2019s nothing but misery waiting for you if you attempt to have any sort of relationship with him. \n\nI hate to say it, but no contact seems like the safest course of action. \n\nGood luck to you. If he hadn\u2019t been so hung up on internal dialog and strife, y\u2019all might have been something. It\u2019s a very common tale.", "NTA but Y T A to yourself. \n\nYou never should have gone. He was clear that he doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you and is deliberately manipulating and playing with your feelings. You need to cut him out of your life. He never intended to be your friend.", "NTA. He wants you to renounce your religion. He\u2019s dangling a relationship in front of you, then whips it away when you express interest, saying your religion is the barrier.", "I'm sorry this happened. I think he wants the fantasy of being in love with someone and going after them. But he doesn't want an actual relationship. He probably picked someone from a different religion precisely because he knows it will stop him from ever getting to the end of his fantasy. \n\nHe doesn't want to be your platonic friend, and he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. He wants to act out the scenario of him endlessly pursuing you and you rejecting him. Please be careful.", "NAH \n\nThere are really serious mental health issues here. I would honestly go no/low contact. I am not a yo-yo.\n\nIt concerns me that you are handling this so well. It makes me me think you dislike yourself. But that is a serious stretch based of very little info. You are in college, maybe check into free mental health services for you. I apologize if that offends.", "NTA \n\nBut really,  cut your losses here and quit wasting time. He's playing with you like a yo-yo and nothing beneficial is going to come of it.", "NTA, but I'm worried about how little you respect yourself to not have chucked him out of your life yet. He's playing a game with you where if you want him, he doesn't want you, and if you don't want him, he wants you - where if you've made plans together, he disappears and is at best indifferent to what that means to your safety and wellbeing (and honestly I'm getting vibes like he might even be enjoying it). You had to *sleep in an airport* because he happened to feel like shunning you that day. That's not a BFF, that's not even a F. You're a toy to him.", "NTA\n\nBut notice his bad behaviour and block him, cut all ties he's manipulating you and doesn't respect you nor your boundaries he probably just wants to fuck around with you then leave honestly just cut him off he isn't enriching your life so he isn't worth the trouble or heart ache.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo no contact with that toxic AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you're right--I tend to overlook things in the name of caring about people. Thank you for the alternative perspective!", "Thank you so much!\n\nIts very sad--he is my best friend but our relationship really changed since he led me on the first time. I appreciate you taking the time to respond to me! <3", "I appreciate the honesty! Its really hard for me to view people in a negative light--especially when they are the people I am closest to. I can't bring myself to understand WHY he would manipulate me (like what is the motive, why spend that much time and energy?) especially when he has always claims to care SO much for me...and so I never thought he was. Thank you so much for your advice--I think I will have to take it.", "Yes! Its so strange because he said it wasn't a problem at first, but then said his feelings about the issue changed because he reflected on it...I don't understand how some sudden reflection can make him not want the relationship that he has worked towards for 8 months. Oh well. I understand his behaviour is unacceptable. Thank you so much for your help and perspective!", "Thank you! This is a really interesting perspective and I didn't even know people chased such a fantasy. I don't know what goes on in his head but I think its not my problem anymore. I hope you have a lovely day <3", "Omg no offence taken! I appreciate the perspective wholeheartedly! :)\n\nI think i like myself just fine \ud83d\ude1c I never had any issues growing up, always very stable and secure--I think my problem is that I don't know how to see the bad in people until it gets REALLY bad. I always find a way to excuse it like \"oh they had a rough upbringing, they had a rough day, they're stressed, etc.\" I believe that is what I did for this guy--when he would cross boundaries and I would get angry, he would tell me that all he wants is to make me the happiest and that he didn't realize that this would upset me, he   was so sorry, etc, which would then just make me feel sorry for him thinking \"omg all he wants is to make me happy and he's trying so hard but he just made a mistake.\"\n\n I need to change that clearly and this thread has helped so much! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you have a wonderful day! <3", "Thank you haha! You are the second person to use the word \"yo-yo.\" I don't know why some people do things like this. Its sad. I'm grateful for people like you who are kind and helpful! <3", "LOL \"not even an F.\" I love that. I agree and you are fully right. I honestly just tend to excuse red flags, in all people not just romantic prospects, because I don't understand how people can be like that. I know I cannot ignore those kinds of things anymore and i won't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!", "Thank you--the problem is that I DO feel like he enriches my life aside from his awful mistakes but I guess the point is that no amount of enriching can compensate for the things he has done to me. Thank you so much for your perspective and advice!", "I've never heard this term before and had to google it! Will definitely be looking into it more! Thank you so much for your perspective!", "Block him and then just use your flight to enjoy what time you have there to have fun by yourself. \n\nIf you\u2019re ever unsure about a situation try to think about it instead as if you were a friend giving yourself advice.", "At first, he didn\u2019t think he could get with you so he jumped when he got the chance. Now he realises it\u2019s possible so he wants to have it all his own way. I assume your religion is saying no sex before marriage or similar? If he can get you to renounce your religion then he\u2019s hoping he can push you into a sexual relationship. From what you are saying he sounds manipulative, and isn\u2019t really interested in being a real friend, he is thinking of himself and looking to the \u2018end game\u2019. A real friend would not have left you high and dry at the airport.", "You too <3", "I love that second piece of advice--I'll be applying that a lot more from now! <3"]}
