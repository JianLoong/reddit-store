The fact that they were apparently actively laughing at you and then nobody even bothered to ask if you were okay when you disappeared puts this over the top.", "While I normally would disagree with leaving without paying, I believe you're not exactly in the wrong here. Did they just expect you to sit in your soiled pants and 'enjoy' your meal while they laughed and humiliated you, without even telling you why? What kind of friends do that, and what did they really expect to happen. Of course you wouldn't want to stay, and shouldn't be expected to. They can consider it a bill for being an asshole, and I'm sorry you were embarrassed like that.\n\n*PS, you said not one of them asked if you were coming back and if you were okay, so this is definitely not a misunderstanding on your part. You understood things exactly as they were, which is your friends are assholes and were laughing at your misfortune. Please don't feel the need to apologize to them, you're the one who deserves an apology.", "NTA (slight Justified Asshole Move) -- friends don't let their friends walk around with a period stain, without notifying them and trying to help. Heck, most women and some men even if not your friend would have your back in this case. That your \"friends\" laughed at you and didn't check on you, says how much they think of you. They can eat the cost and you ought to find better friends.", "Go find a local organization that offers free pads and tampons to women and donate what you owe them in their names. NTA", "A real friend would have let you know so you could deal with it, maybe have a laugh with you about it after. NTA, nice people are rarer but it's better to have no friends than be friends with assholes. \n\nPs: paying for your meal would have been the CLASSY move, I'd have commended you for it. But I say fuck the classy move and fuck them", "NTA. agree with another comment, it was a slight asshole move but imo it was justified. you need better friends, the fact that they didn\u2019t even text you when you left is really telling of their characters.", "Ditching friends: NTA, if no one told you the situation it's hard to call them friends. Now that I'm writing more, sounds like it was a big situation before anyone knew what was going on but they still should have told you. \n\nNot paying them: idk, I'm split. On the one hand, you ordered everything with the intent to pay. On the other hand, seems like you need to think about whether or not you want to stay friends. If you pay them, they're going to forget about this faster than they will. If you don't pay them, you better find a good way to justify it and not be surprised if you start getting excluded from things down the road", "Under normal circumstances, I would say that's a very asshole-ish thing to do. However, as I read this two things came to mind: 1.) Those aren't your friends. 2.)

Real friends simply wouldn\u2019t have done that to you.", "Always honor debts, you ate/drank the goods anyway.\n\nFIND a new set of friends though, it sounds like they don't have your back.", "NTA you need new friends", "You should pay for your meal but not talk to them anymore", "YTA, but with a good reason. You should always pay for what you order unless otherwise pre-arranged. Yeah, you should also never hang out with them again either.", "NTA but pay them and don\u2019t give them a reason to be right. After that, send them far away.", "YTA it\u2018s still your bill to pay also they are not your \u201efriends\u201c", "NTA - Those are not friends. Friends look out for each other. You seem like a good person who can make much better friends. One of them should have immediately grabbed a sweater or jacket and covered you or at least tell you what happened. The fact that they asked you for the money after treating you like that is insane. The least they could do is cover you for treating you like that. I highly doubt any of these people have any good intentions towards you. Sorry if I sound extreme but that\u2019s kinda like betrayal to me.", "NTA. They were rude to you. Don\u2019t even give them the time of day. Cut them off and refuse to pay them back.", "ESH: them for the way they treated you and you for not paying your bill.", "ESH. They absolutely should\u2019ve told you or asked if you were okay (but not everyone knows how to communicate that appropriately), and while I get the need to take back some control after feeling humiliated - withholding money for food and drinks you consumed is passive-aggressive, especially at your age when a lot of people are struggling. \n\nThat said, you don\u2019t have to stay quiet. Tell them you\u2019re upset they didn\u2019t tell you or check up on you! That\u2019s messed up.", "ESH \n\nI think you lose all moral high ground not paying......yes they were ah but it feels really icky that you stiffed a bill. \n\nTo me stiffing a bill, is like cheating or littering, my whole body recoils at the thought.", "NTA. those people are NOT your friends.", "NTA - they are NOT good friends at all. A good friend would have pulled you aside and told you. Completely disrespectful towards you. Plus you would have had to leave anyway, my advice is stay away from them and get some new friends because they seem like assholes.", "Your friends are shit but that doesn't mean they owe you a meal for free. ESH.", "NTA wow they definitely don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re in their 20\u2019s. Screw them. If they were your friends they would have been happy to cover your tab so you could take care of yourself and they would have been offering to help in any way possible. I\u2019d probably crumple up a $20 and have it handy in case I saw any of them but other than that, you did fine. Don\u2019t keep quiet about it either- if anyone asks why you all had a falling out, make sure to speak up that they publicly humiliated/shamed you\u2026people need to know they suck so they can be avoided. Sorry you went through that- I\u2019ve been through that embarrassment publicly before too\u2026it\u2019s the worst!", "I wouldn't say you're an AH, but if I were you, I would still pay out of principle. They don't owe you money. They do owe you an apology if they want to keep you as a friend. If this was a guy thing, we would laugh our asses off to this, but females are a bit more sensitive to this sort of thing I guess. They are definitively AH by the way, just to be 100% clear", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can't even imagine letting a friend walk around with a stain of any nature, let alone from their period, AND NOT HELP. I just can't imagine being that mean and hateful to a friend!!! Hell not even a stranger!! IF it helps, I had the same issue once in high school. Know what the guy sitting behind me did?? Got up and followed me out, while taking off his sweatshirt. Got out in the hall and he handed it to me saying I could tie it around my waist, that his sister had it happen to her so, as he put it \"I got you covered girl\". So there ARE kids out there who are mature enough and nice enough to actually BE real friends. Just not that group. You deserve better.", "NTA, maybe you acted rude, but they did the same.
