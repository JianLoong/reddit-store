Did they just expect you to sit in your soiled pants and 'enjoy' your meal while they laughed and humiliated you, without even telling you why?

They can consider it a bill for being an asshole, and I'm sorry you were embarrassed like that.\n\n*PS, you said not one of them asked if you were coming back and if you were okay, so this is definitely not a misunderstanding on your part. You understood things exactly as they were, which is your friends are assholes and were laughing at your misfortune.

But I say fuck the classy move and fuck them", "NTA. agree with another comment, it was a slight asshole move but imo it was justified. you need better friends, the fact that they didn\u2019t even text you when you left is really telling of their characters.", "Ditching friends: NTA, if no one told you the situation it's hard to call them friends. Now that I'm writing more, sounds like it was a big situation before anyone knew what was going on but they still should have told you. \n\nNot paying them: idk, I'm split. On the one hand, you ordered everything with the intent to pay. On the other hand, seems like you need to think about whether or not you want to stay friends. If you pay them, they're going to forget about this faster than they will. If you don't pay them, you better find a good way to justify it and not be surprised if you start getting excluded from things down the road", "Under normal circumstances, I would say that's a very asshole-ish thing to do.

They absolutely should\u2019ve told you or asked if you were okay (but not everyone knows how to communicate that appropriately), and while I get the need to take back some control after feeling humiliated - withholding money for food and drinks you consumed is passive-aggressive, especially at your age when a lot of people are struggling. \n\nThat said, you don\u2019t have to stay quiet.

If they were your friends they would have been happy to cover your tab so you could take care of yourself and they would have been offering to help in any way possible. I\u2019d probably crumple up a $20 and have it handy in case I saw any of them but other than that, you did fine. Don\u2019t keep quiet about it either- if anyone asks why you all had a falling out, make sure to speak up that they publicly humiliated/shamed you\u2026people need to know they suck so they can be avoided.

They don't owe you money. They do owe you an apology if they want to keep you as a friend.

I can't even imagine letting a friend walk around with a stain of any nature, let alone from their period, AND NOT HELP. I just can't imagine being that mean and hateful to a friend!!! Hell not even a stranger!! IF it helps, I had the same issue once in high school. Know what the guy sitting behind me did?? Got up and followed me out, while taking off his sweatshirt. Got out in the hall and he handed it to me saying I could tie it around my waist, that his sister had it happen to her so, as he put it \"I got you covered girl\". So there ARE kids out there who are mature enough and nice enough to actually BE real friends. Just not that group. You deserve better.", "NTA, maybe you acted rude, but they did the same. I absolutely understand your position, they aren't your friends if they can't tell you that your pants r literally covered in blood. The fact that they were laughing is concerning..", "Friends?? Where did you find this word?

You shouldn't expect others to pay for you because you were too embarrassed to return. Be glad they had enough money to cover your food at the time.", "You need to pay them.

But for the following reasons. \n\n1) you don\u2019t want to owe these \u201cfriends\u201d anything. \n\n2) it will make sure you keep a clear conscience. \n\n3) it gives them ammunition to use against you. They can tell people how they aren\u2019t friends with you anymore because you refused to pay for your food and drinks, and they had to cover for you. \n\n4) you are better than them. Don\u2019t sink to their level. \n\nHere is what I think you should do. Venmo the money. Put in the memo line food and drinks. Don\u2019t send a note, don\u2019t call, nothing else for conversation.

They are nothing to you now. \n\nIf one of them messages you or calls ignore it. \n\nFinally if one of them comes up to you directly to ask you what\u2019s going on.

If they laugh at you and embarrass you like this, especially over something private like this, then they are NOT your friends. \n\nSticking then with your bill was the right move, and so was ghosting them until you have the right words to say to them. Tell them how they have made you feel and that no true friend would have humiliated you or anyone else over this and them block them out of your life and move on with your head held high.

Either way, if you do pay it back and you can do so without talking to them, do that.

I find it very disgusting that one of the friends is a female, one would think she would understand and show some sorority, but instead she prefers laughing at you while you feel humiliated.
