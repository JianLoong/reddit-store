Anyone who gets mad at you is admitting they care more about being an ass than helping people.", "NTA, OP.\n\nAnd, thanks for the hot tip in getting responses out of people!", "NTA", "ESH.\n\nWithout knowing your industry, its hard to give nuance, but I will say this as someone senior who does get pestered all day by juniors and tries to answer in the order things were asked around my responsibilities, but will jump a response up the queue if it's going to go catastrophically wrong; this is not the way you behave in a professional environment. \n\nYou have lines of escalation, and you should be using them. Your initial email should state something like \"i need replies to this by Thursday at 3pm\" and from wednesday you should be looping your and their managers in to chase anyone still dragging their feet. \n\nIf someone messages me asking \"what is the best tool to use for task y?\" they will get an answer when I have the time to calculate that it's tool z. If I get a message declaring \"tool z is shit for task y, I'm just going to use x instead\", yes, I will drop everything to correct them then and there because using tool x could break a LOT of shit. Shit which it will then take a handful of seniors several days to fix.\n\nAnd I might let it slide as a brain fart the first couple of times, but the second it becomes clear this is a habitual thing, those corrections will start ccing in your manager. And my manager. And possibly the department head. Depending on the severity of the fuck up you could have caused, I may raise an official complaint, complete with a break down of how much time it has cost the company every time I've had to down tools and interrupt the workflow to prevent your fuckwittedness, and recommend you for retraining. When and if the time comes for promotions to be considered and recommended, I will fight tooth and nail for your name to never be on the list, and if I am not the only one you've done this to, that won't be a hard sell.\n\nYou might be getting results short term, but long term you are tanking your professional reputation with the people you need to cooperate with for your job. I don't think this is going to end the way you think it's going to end.\n\nThe only reason I have put esh is because for one thing, I try to give estimates for how long it will take me to reply to a query, whether that is a few hours, days or the following week, and it doesn't sound like they are, and for another, assuming you aren't aaking really atupid basic questions that can be answered by google, they should have in house knowledge documented so you can do your own research or know who to ask rather than take the mass email shotgun approach, and it doesn't sound like they've done that either. But honestly, this is mostly a  yta unless you work somewhere highly unusual where things like workflows or results are less important.\n\nAlso, this is a weird place to ask this question, because this is less \"am I an ass?\" And more \"is this an acceptable way to get answers in the workplace or am I fucking up my career?\" Where no one is necessarily an asshole, it's just how much you are or are not screwing up. Askamanager is probably a way better place to ask this; I suspect this is the sort of query she would like to answer individually (you will need to give a few more anonymised job details though, most people phrase theirs as if they worked for a teapot manufacturer) but if she declines they have an open thread on Fridays. The readers there can probably offer a more realistic view than this place which tends to be mostly crewed by teens and people at the beginning of their careers, rather than those au fait with professional norms.", "NTA, if it works, then its not stupid. The co worker is clearly immature. I use alot of different kinds of ways to get results. Context, I have 8 soldiers to look after, lead and maintain training. I use this method on younger lads, but direct questions as mini tests, or ask if someone has a better way. It works basically all the time.
