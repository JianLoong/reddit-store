But NTA\n\nHonestly even though I don't support being ashamed of your body, you were bullied throughout for it and you know what it's like to go through it. \n\nThat's why you asked your sister before doing the same. Which isn't wrong because she herself told you that she was receiving hurtful comments due to it. You never forced her...you just asked her (i hope it is what happened). Normalise that is ok to have facial hair but if it makes her feel more good about herself she can remove it ! \n\nI understand the elder sister's perspective too that you should appreciate who you are...but she won't know what you went through because she may not have gotten bullied but you did.", "NTA\n\nKids can be so nasty in school, you did the right thing by protecting your little sister before she starts classes. You\u2019re saving her from the bullying that sometimes happens when you finally get rid of x thing you\u2019ve been bullied for and bullies just turn that into a thing they bully you for. I experienced that. It\u2019s not nice.\n\nSounds like your mum knows you\u2019ve done the right thing too and is just trying to avoid your sisters wrath.", "NTA\n\nThe reason I'm going with this and not Nah like some other people is the fact that your older sister assumes you pushed her to do that. That's an asshole move to do. Especially since it's not true and she wasn't there to even confirm that in the first place. \n\nYour younger sister wanted it. You can still teach her it's nothing to be ashamed of, but of course if she doesn't want one, she doesn't want one and her shaving isn't the end of the world. \n\nAlso? \"Consulted them before hand\"? Before.. What? Before your little sister picked up a razor herself? I'm sorry but your mother has to be aware of the teasing it caused and her saying you should consult her or \" them\" ig is a little weird. Sure 10 years is young, but bullying can also end lives.. Hair grows back.", "NTA. You are just protecting your little sister and wants the best for her welfare. It's best to sort it out with your older sister and come to terms for the best of interest of your little sister.", "Definitely NTA you are doing your sister a solid.", "NTA you didn't force her to shave, and shaving is not permanent by any means. Sure, in an ideal world we would all have the confidence to be as we are without giving a single shit about what other people think or say- but we are not in an ideal world and showing support and empathy is more important than broad ideologies. You shared your personal experience and offered to help her with shaving safely. She can stop doing so if she wants, she can continue if she wants. She can experiment and make advant guard mustaches apart of her look if she wants. When she is older she can go on to have the hair permanently removed if she wants. Regardless of what anyone else (you, your sister, her peers) thinks or says she should have the tools to make choices for herself. So long as you support her if she decides to not shave, you have, imo, done the right thing.", "NTA by a mile\n\nTo be honest, I was one of those kids who made fun of this kind of stuff. Not proud of it.\n\nIt is bound to happen. It's not good and of course it would be nice, if the society would move past those things but it is what it is.\n\nYour older sister can try to get a job as a substitute teacher and wear a thick, fake mustache to see how it goes. After that, she can think again about bullying.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you were being a supportive big sister and showing her how to deal with a common issue that lots of girls face as they grow up.", "NTA\n\n>that we should teach her how to accept it and not see it as a flaw. \n\nI don't think partaking in hair removal necessarily means you see it as some shameful flaw. I take an eyebrow razor to my upper lip and chin, and it doesn't affect my self-worth one bit. I'm just like... yeah I'd rather not have long chin whiskers. Boom, done. Point is, it's great that your older sister wants to instill self-acceptance, but that does not mean forcing younger sis to keep unwanted hair. You do that by teaching her that it's *her* face and therefore *her* decision. Seems like you did a great job navigating that by asking her what *she* wants to do, and then providing her support with tools and education... and cherry on top, even accommodated to her skin type.\n\nalso just to point out:\n\n>She said that I was creating insecurities for our younger sister and that it\u2019s not a given that the kids would bully her for her moustache \n\nyet it does seem to be a given....\n\n>My (10F) sister is starting middle school in a few months, and mentioned her (even thicker than mine) moustache a few times, specifically in reference to hurtful comments about it.", "Good lord NTA.", "NTA. You know what causes insecurities? Getting bullied about your appearance. And she already complained about it. If your sister and parents didn't want to help you, that's their prerogative. But good on you for helping your sister. You are good people.", "NTA but don't shave - pluck or wax.", "NAH\n\nyour sister isn't wrong; you shouldn't have to change your physical appearance to fit societal standards of beauty.\n\nbut kids can be sooooo freaking mean to people who are different. it's not a \"given\" that the other kids will tease her for the mustache but cmon...have you met a middle schooler before? those guys are ruthless. especially since she's much younger than the avg middle schooler. \n\nalso she's 10, old enough to understand what she does and doesn't want regarding phys. appearance, and if she wants the mustache gone then its gone!!!", "NTA, but doesn't grow facial hair back stronger and darker and longer when you shave it? Thats at least what i heard and can confirm from own experience.", "I'd go with NAH. \nThere's a difference between doing something only because people bully it and the change doesn't make you more happy and doing something because people bully it but the change makes you feel better. \n\nI'd obviously, and I imagine you did it too, talk to your sister and explain that it's not necessary, that it's a part of her and your lineage and that if she's only doing it because of comments it's probably not worth doing it, that she should also do it if it makes herself feel better about herself. \n\nBut it's also a question of : would you let yourself or someone get bullied because of something that's changeable ? \nI'm not saying this as in \" bullies are right \" obviously not, I have been bullied myself. But sometimes it's better to do the change that causes the bullying to get rid of the bullying. A bully is by default a bad person, so they won't change their mind because you tell them to, actions are needed to have peace. \n\nConclusion : tell her she doesn't need it, but she can do it if it'll make herself feel better about it. :)", "NAH. I have thick leg hair and got destroyed in school for it. It sucks but that's reality. We shouldn't have to change ourselves but at the same time we do if we wanna live easier lives.
