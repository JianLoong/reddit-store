{"id": 11272, "submission_id": "11fwsgh", "title": "AITA For making my mother clinically depressed?", "selftext": " This is very emotional for me. I (20) female has dealt with an unbelievable amount of abuse from my mother (39). I grew up dealing with neglect and drug addicts. Despite it all, I was always a good kid. I did good in school, and did everything I could to make my mom happy. I always took care of my mother and no doubt loved her through everything. Little did I know how completely blinded I was to all the abuse I was enduring. Anyway, down to why I'm righting this post.  She threw me out with nothing on my 18th birthday. I couldn't go anywhere around my other family due to her threats of what she would do if I did.  So I had no family I could go to. I was homeless, wondering each day where I would sleep that night or what I would eat. Not to mention this was also in the middle of my senior year of high school. During this time I endured things I just cant put into words on here, I had lost everything. It was the lowest point of my life.  I was in and out mental hospitals, going through intense therapy, and trying to keep it all together. But I'm happy to say that things started working out in my favor. I finished high school and got my diploma, I started to love waking up every day when I always woke up wishing I wasn't alive. I started to find my worth and myself, making a steady income with my husband, and getting help for some things I was diagnosed with ( Autism spectrum disorder, PTSD, major depressive disorder). I live an over all happy and stable life now for the first time in my life. Recently, my family has been coming to me about how I need to try to make amends with my mom and fix our relationship because she has been steadily going downhill and becoming really depressed.  I tried to make amends with her and develop a relationship but she always had way better things to do.  This also hurt me, and it started to bring back memories I worked so hard to heal from. Eventually, I told my mom how I really felt. How I found happiness for the first time in ever no thanks to her, and I cant allow her toxicity back in my life. I basically told her I'm done with it all. I have to protect mine and my partners happiness at all costs. There was a lot more said but those were the high points. But, some of my family didn't like this. They said she needed patience's and understanding, and that I am a butthole for saying those things. They said I should keep trying to fix our relationship no matter what because she is my mother and I only get one. This all has hurt me very bad and has been getting to me when I have been doing so good for myself, and I feel so bad and hurt. I always loved my mom through it all, and my heart longs for that mother daughter bond I never had and feel I never will have. I don't want to hurt my mom even through all she put me through.

My mom and I have never had a mother daughter relationship either and never will. So I get it. I'd say more but it would be writing a book. It took me going no contact with my mother for a few years and having those same discussions with my Dad's side of the family and taking time to consider it but I did end up sending my mom a letter in the mail where I wrote down everything I felt, I was the bigger the person and apologized first even though I didn't/shouldn't of had to, and I told her that if there was any possibility we could try to start over I'd like to give it a try and see how things go. We get along decent now. She is doing better mentally herself but we still aren't close at all and it's been about 4 years or so since then. You just aren't in the right place now to want to do that and that's ok. You need more time and they should respect that. But I will say that your family is right. You only have 1 mother. She isn't the best mom ever but you will regret not having a relationship with her. When I finally decided to reach out to my mom, I was already getting depressed again just having other's rub it in my face how good of a relationship they have with theirs and asking me a lot of personal questions about mine. I then started to think about the possibilities if she passed away and I never reached out, I would have never known if she would still be a horrible mother or if we could work things out and at least be civil with each other or if by some miracle maybe we could have been really close and finally got to experience what it's like to have a good mom. I don't regret reaching out to my mom even though she still isn't the best but our relationship is a lot better than what it was years ago and for that I am grateful. When you get to that place, if you ever do, do reach out to your mom and at least give it a chance. If it doesn't work out then at least you know you tried and you don't have to reach out to ever again if that's what you choose to do. I hope things continue to get better for you.\n\nEdit to add: If you need to reach out to someone who understands your situation and has walked in your shoes, feel free to message me.

Where were they when you were on the street at 18?  You owe yourself the best possible life, and it sounds like you've begun to live it.

Where were they when she kicked you out and you disappeared, suddenly made homeless? Where was the familial obligation then?\n\nThey can all kick rocks. Live your best life without any of them!", "NTA - YOU cannot make your mother (or anyone else for that matter) CLINICALLY depressed. That is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Frequently, substance abuse alters the pituitary gland - releasing too many hormones (dopamine, adrenaline, etc.) over time that will eventually do permanent damage to the body. Until such time as your mother gets help for her clinical and emotional depression, it is best that you go NC. From the sounds of it, she needs more than a psychiatrist, she needs a good therapist and rehab. Don't completely write her off, but go NC until she gets help. If and when she becomes emotionally stable, then maybe you can consider reconnection therapy. You two have a lot of things to work out. A lot of forgiveness to extol.  From your wording, you sound like you have been through a great deal of very positive therapy yourself. Congrats! You are very strong and brave.\n\nQuestion: if you had a baby - would you leave him/her alone with your mother?

Only as much as you can give while protecting your own mental health. If you feel like she\u2019s healthy and ready to truly make amends, that\u2019s one thing. But if she\u2019s still a vortex of chaos and unmanaged mental heath disorders, that\u2019ll suck up more energy than any one person can muster. \n\nAfter all, the \u201cyou only get one...\u201d goes both ways.

You need to make it clear to your relatives she abused amd neglectedyou till you were not bringing in befits for ger anymore then she made you homeless amd threatened you to the point you couldn't seek help from family,  would they be do forgiving if that happened yo them? Anyone who us on your mom's side go no contact with including your mother,  none of this was your fault!", "NTA. Your \"upbringing\" or lack thereof by your mother has surely kicked the crap out of your self-esteem, and THAT is why you are questioning yourself. \n\nShe is the one who was abusive. It was HER job to make amends to YOU, not the other way around. But she has made it clear that she has done no self-reflection and hasn't taken any responsibility.\n\nYou have zero responsibility for her depression, and those family members are massively over-stepping. They have no business telling you how to conduct a relationship with your mother or anyone. They can choose whatever relationship with her they want - they don't get to choose yours.

She isn't even sorry, and she had \"better things to do\" than try and turn that around. She made her choices, and as an adult she has the right to her own choices, but also has to accept the consequences. \n\nYou are an adult, you have a right to your own choices too. You were doing good until people started trying to force your mother back into your life. Now you are doing not so good.
