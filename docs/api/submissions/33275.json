But a) she isn\u2019t your child and isn\u2019t your responsibility. And b) people need to go through their own mistakes. The best we can do is warn them as kindly as we can, because people will usually clam up to harshness, and give advice if asked and hope they make the right decision.

I guess the environment I grew up with, a 17 year old asking for alcohol was super normal, so that could be clouding my judgements. She already did it and everything happens for a reason. She still shouldn\u2019t carry all the responsibility for this kid that isn\u2019t hers.", "Yeah, your judgment is definitely clouded, kids shouldn\u2019t drink. Period, 17 is still a child. At least in the USA. This is the reason why teenage girls get assaulted and kidnapped. Adults and their poor judgment.", "In Europe its way more common to drink at earlier ages. 17 is really normal here. Teenagers want to experiment and its better for it to be in a safe and more controlled environment than getting black-out drunk any time due to having learnt no moderation etc."]}
