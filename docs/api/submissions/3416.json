You know you're NTA.\n\nHave you checked out the sub-reddits for support for people with toxic parents.\n\nThere's a few of them.", "NTA but I would also think about telling your sister that if she does try to get that woman even 100 yards from you that you'll never speak to her again.", "NTA, I'm sorry both of your parents treated you like a pawn. But you are an adult now. She kicked you out and SOLD YOUR DOG. \n\nTell her she can come visit when your dog is back and she goes to therapy and you accept her apology and no sooner.", "NTA. Did you get your dog back??", "NTA\n\nYou should completely cut any contact with your \"mother\". That's not a parent. Having even a remote relationship with her is damaging you. You are so traumatized that you somehow keep her in your life, you let her borrow your dog, etc. That's only hurting you.\n\nYou also need to tell your sisters everything: all the details, all the bitter truth. They need to understand how shit your mother was to you. \n\nYour husband is a smart man. I'm sure he saw through your mother's schemes. The reason why he never spoke about the wedding day conversation, was not to hurt you. What was the point, causing you unnecessary pain. \n\nThe reason he spoke up now, is that he realizes the toxicity your mother brings, and he's trying to bring you the ammunition so you can finally decide to cut her out of your life.", "NTA.\nI am so sorry OP. Please believe me when I say you are so so much better than the parents you were given. Your husband accepts you honey, I accept you. You sound like a strong, intelligent, kind, amazing person. It's ok to let go of things that hurt you including you shit ass mom. Sending you hugs if you want them.", "NTA.  Your mental health comes first.  I hope you're in therapy to recover from the wounds she dealt you and that you didn't deserve.", "NTA - You are a grown woman that can make your choices.  If you don't want your mom in your house, that's your business.  Obviously barring your mom to come to your house isn't going to help the relationship between the two of you.  But if that's what you want, that's your decision to make.", "NTA - Your mother is a piece of work.  Perhaps your father was trying to rescue you from her.  Who knows, that is all in the past now.  \n\nYour husband most likely knows the truth.  The only thing you can do to keep yourself safe is go NC with your egg donor and try to live your best life with your husband.  Also, I know it has been said so many times but please get some professional help in dealing with the pain your ex-mom caused.  Doing the math you are 40 years old.  you have made your life with your husband and whomever else is in your life.  Your ex-mom and ex-step hold no value or importance.  \n\nYour sisters may need to know that their mother never gave you anything of value either physical or emotional.  Whatever they got from her was never offered to you.  Please try and feel better, there are actually a lot of people in the world that are good and kind.  Be happy as best you can.", "NTA forever and always.\n\nThe very *least* you are owed is for other people not to bring someone who was at the very, best horrifically neglectful and at the worst overtly abusive into your space without your permission.\n\nNothing that happened to you was your fault.  Not being kidnapped, not the fact that your Mom and Stepdad treated you like a burden, not the fact that you were kicked out and essentially erased from the record, not your mother shit-talking you to your now-husband on your wedding day, not her selling your fucking dog (theft in every state, for the record).\n\nIt is totally understandable to want to have a relationship with your family.  They're your blood.  Of course you want those connections.\n\nThat being said, while you haven't mentioned too much about your sisters, the fact that one of them seems to be insisting on bringing your mother to your house when you don't want that doesn't bode well.\n\nIf you want to have real and healthy relationships with your sisters, I encourage you to sit down with each of them (separately!) and lay out clearly and succinctly, ideally with as little emotion as you can manage, that you need to go NC with your Mom (you are going NC, right?  Please tell me you're going NC, because she's never going to stop trying to destroy your life).  If they want to know why, tell them why--again, as calmly as you can, lest there be accusations of you being melodramatic or overwrought (not that you would deserve those accusations, but it happens in families like yours).\n\nLet them know that you're not expecting or asking them to be in the middle--in fact you are directly asking them not to.  You don't want to hear about anything your Mom is saying or doing, and ask them not to try to tell you, and you expect and ask them not to share any information about you with her, nor to try to facilitate any kind of reunion or surprise meeting.  If they can't respect those very, very simple guidelines, there's a decent chance that they are made in your mother's image and you're better off without them.\n\nI'm so sorry.  You have deserved better since you were a young child and you deserve better now.", "NTA. I'd want her to stay away from me, too.\n\nYou probably should have reported your dog stolen. It's okay to report bio relations to the police for crimes they commit against you, like theft.", "NTA. File a police report on your dog at least.", "Most def NTA - as others have said u need to cut all contact with ur mum - selling ur beloved pet should have been the end. \n\nDespite of every thing that's happened it sound you have become an amazing strong person", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
