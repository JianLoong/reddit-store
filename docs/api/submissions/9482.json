There are eight of us altogether, but I only have one full sister. The rest are all half siblings from both my mum\u2019s and my dad\u2019s side. \n\nNow I have a brother who is 21. I\u2019ll call him D. He was adopted out of the family as a baby, me and my other sister were very young at the time and lived with our dad as my mother was seen as an unfit parent. Because my dad wasn\u2019t D\u2019s dad, he was adopted. My mother then married and then had 3 other children nearly a decade later.  \n\nD reached out to me in 2021 and he said he wanted to get to know his birth family. We met up once, he came to my baby shower last February, met my mother there and even spent Christmas with her last year. But me and him haven\u2019t seen each other since February. \n\nNow here\u2019s the deal\n\nD has a girlfriend (20) who I\u2019ll refer to as M. I don\u2019t know M in person but last year she added me on fb. I accepted as I wanted to get to know D properly and she was supposedly apart of his life. However, she then kept harassing me to find out why D wasn\u2019t answering his phone and if D has spoken about her, demanding answers why it was taking D so long to pick up the phone. It didn\u2019t stop there unfortunately and when I say this woman is mentally unstable I do actually mean it and I don\u2019t say that lightly. \n\nMy son was then taken to hospital with bronchitis last November and I had enough of her messaging me about D continuously so I asked her if she could stop messaging me about D because I don\u2019t know her and I barely know D and I\u2019m more concerned over my baby who was in hospital. She said some pretty unkind things and then blocked me. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m getting married in 2 months now. I invited D to my wedding and gave him a plus 1 because I believed it was the polite thing to do. The RSVP date has been and gone, so I start chasing people up to see if they are attending or not. I messaged D at the end of December, no response, I message him again mid January, still no response, so I assume he isn\u2019t coming. Until I get a message today and he\u2019s asking me if he and M can stay with me for the wedding or if I can put them up in a hotel.\n\nNow I\u2019m a little baffled because firstly I have no money at all to start paying for hotels, and if he had answered me the first two times I could\u2019ve sorted it out then when I did have funds still, and secondly, I do not want M in my house, anywhere near my child and now I\u2019m being called unreasonable and unhelpful. I\u2019m being told that as the eldest sister I have a responsibility to help out and I wanted him there at my wedding and now I\u2019m not doing anything to accommodate for him and his girlfriend. \n\nIf he came alone I wouldn\u2019t have minded so much, but I don\u2019t want his girlfriend staying with me and in my house. \n\nAITA for this?\n\n**Edit to add** so I probably wasn\u2019t very clear: I knew he would bring M to the wedding, I didn\u2019t mind that so much. I just didn\u2019t think he was going to expect me to put them up and in my own house. I have an issue with her being in my house and around my child. At a wedding, at least there are other people there", "created_utc": 1675884789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x8dyj/aita_for_not_letting_my_brother_stay_with_me_if/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's no offer to stay with you, no offer to stay in a hotel.\n\nI don't think I need to tell you this, but under absolutely no circumstances do you want a person like that staying with you on or around your wedding day. \n\nYour response should be something like: Sorry, you missed the RSVP date and both follow-ups.

It\u2019s traditional and reasonable for guests to a wedding to take care of their own lodging, much less be guests at the couple\u2019s house.

You have no obligation to put them up.

You're well within your rights to tell D you aren't paying for their hotel and he's not staying at your place right before the wedding.   I'd assume it would be too chaotic in your home to take additional guests on those days.  \n\nIf other family members are giving you shit over this, that's rude.   This is your day, not D's.   Those family members are more than free to pay for D's hotel or have them  stay  over at thei place if they think it's the right thing, but it sounds like they don't want to either.  So they don't have any moral high ground to lecture you.   \n\nAs for excluding M but not D, you already sent the +1.  You can take it back using the excuse that he didn't RSVP in time, but you know that's going to start its own whirlwind of new drama.  Same if you exclude D entirely.   At the same time if D and M come it's possible they might be a problem, but hopefully they have the decency to behave.   All 3 are valid options for you.   It's your wedding, not theirs.   \n\nGood luck and congratulations.", "Nta but surely when you gave him a plus one you must have known he would bring his girlfriend? I mean who else would he bring?

But don't let her stay with you, it will ruin your wedding.", "NTA, and anyone who is guilt-tripping you is out to lunch. \n\nYou're not responsible for D and M's lodging, that's entirely on them. It's very common (and reasonable) for people to not attend an event because they lack the funds. That's not your problem, but theirs.\n\nM's mental instability (and history abusing you with it) is a huge problem. Combine that with having them in your home prior to and around your wedding, and you're just asking for trouble.", "Holy shit.\n\nNTA.  You'd be NTA even if M wasn't a nightmare to deal with - you have no obligation to house them or pay for their hotel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd block both of them.", "NTA -- tell the people calling you unreasonable to put him up", "NTA. First and foremost, your house is your house. YOU decide who gets to stay and who doesn't. Based on the way you described the actions of D's girlfriend, I believe you made the correct decision not to allow her in your home or near your family. Second, you have no obligation to pay for their hotel room. You are the oldest sister, but you are not D's parent. Extended family can be a wonderful thing, but not if some members lay a guilt trip on others demanding financial assistance.", "#NTA\n\nWeddings always bring out the most stressful situations and absurd expectations. It\u2019s your wedding, your house, your funds - and you have no obligation here to house a person who has previously been harassing you and been rude to you.

Let people talk, you do you.", "NTA - \"Because the RSVP date has long past I can no longer accommodate your plus 1 at the wedding.
