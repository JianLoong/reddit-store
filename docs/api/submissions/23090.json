She\u2019s being unreasonable. Non-work time doesn\u2019t automatically become together time. \n\nI suspect she\u2019s bored and that\u2019s why this is somehow bothering her.

If anything taking care of yourself mentally should make the time you spend together of higher quality.", "NTA. \n\nYou're seeing a therapist (for whatever reason). They suggested that you do these entires. Your partner knows of it. It's one hour, not the whole day. Tell her to relax and watch Netflix or whatever until you're home.", "NTA in my opinion, but then again I totally don't get people who want to pend every non-working moment with their partner. If my partner spent an hour in another room every night I would be thrilled for the alone time. \n\nMaybe just try to gently continue explaining to her why this is important to you.", "NTA it\u2019s healthy for you to have time alone to decompress. It\u2019s not healthy the have to be with each other every second you\u2019re home.", "Nta and you dont need to spend every waking minute at home w your gf while she is there. There is nothing weird about what you're doing and you absolutely do not need to consider her feelings before you take 1 measly hour of privacy to write a journal entry. My SO of 23 years and I keep.....GASP.....separate living rooms. Autonomy is good for relationships. Codependence is not.", "NTA - I struggle with my partner being in his office but when he\u2019s not working he tends to be in there an hour in the morning and an hour or more in the evening. So on work days he\u2019s in there minimum of 10.5 hours. That\u2019s A LOT. \n\nAn hour seems reasonable to me! And if you communicate it it\u2019s even better. Not sure what your gf wants/needs aside from some assurance. Hope you can talk about it more, and figure it out with her.", "NTA. She\u2019s the unreasonable one", "Your NTA but \"you're selfish\" \"Um actually your selfish.\" Isn't the rebuttal you think it is. And then coming here, to what? Validate that you're right? It's not about who's right it's about communication.\n\nJournalling is important to you. Couple time is important to her. She's saying weird so she doesn't have to make a request and be vulnerable.\n\nTalk and figure it out.", "NTA", "Nta. This is totally valid. Use that office time.", "NAH\n\nYou are doing something at the suggestion of your therapist, which helps with your mental health.\n\nShe is seeing something that concerns her, and she's having open communication and bringing it up to you.\n\nNo one's an asshole, but now starts the great struggle in any relationship, compromise.", "NAH\nShe has feelings that you are not paying properly attention to. By saying she is selfish you are denying her feelings, While she, at the same time, has a hard time to digest what you are going through. You need to listen to her, and she needs to listen to you. Each of your judgements about tje other one is selfish Will get you nowhere as you invalidate what is important to you and to her. That is no reasonable Way of communicating with each other. \n\nListen, acknowledge the other persons feelings, and Then find a way where you can both get your needs sorted out.", "So NAH but I did want to add that I've been journaling for years and an hour a day is pretty long (I don't write every day all the time, so I'm probably at about an hour or so a week). I'm gonna echo that you need to communicate better and maybe find a compromise.", "NAH, while it\u2019s fair for your gf to ask for time together, you\u2019re following advice from your therapist to maintain your mental health.", "NAH\n\nThis seems like something you can talk out rather than send to Reddit for hot takes. An hour journaling a day is rather on the long side. Journaling is an essential healthcare strategy for many people. A balance can certainly be found.", "NAH. Or ESH because both of you decided to have a accusatory conversation instead of a constructive one. Ugh, honestly I don't even know.\n\nBecause I think AITA is the wrong question to ask here. I think it would be wise to explore her discomfort with your journalling and whether a compromise is possible. \n\nI don't know what feeling your partner has towards this, but it could be many things with simple solutions. Could it be the case that your partner is feeling excluded from your inner world (that you may be expressing while journalling), and she wants to feel more included in what's going on in your head? Or could it be the case that she is feeling insecure about how you need physical distance from her to decompress? Or that she cannot be part of your decompression? Or that she feels like she cannot process her day with you, because you are all decompressed when you leave the office while she still needs to talk about her day? \n\nI truly don't know. Maybe the solution is as simple as: only doing it half an hour, talking with her for half an hour about your and her day, sharing some stuff you wrote down, or... buying a second sofa if the apartment is that much bigger. \n\nNone of this has to mean you are not allowed to journal in peace and quiet anymore. It seems as if you immediately jumped to the conclusion (thus, your defensiveness) that she wanted you to stop, instead of asking what's going on and what you both can do. She can understand while it is important to you but still feel insecure / lonely / excluded / whatever because of it. Your defensiveness is not really productive, nor compassionate. Your partner needs to be clearer about what she needs to not feel this way. If she would demand you stop immediately, that would change the discussion but now the conflict just seems a poorly handled conservation with neither of you trying to solve the source of the problem...", "NAH Yes, she does know what your doing.  Yes, you should do what you need to do for self care.  That said, this amount of journaling may make a \"partner\" feel uneasy with wonder of just what is running through your mind.  I am NOT saying that you shouldn't do it.  But I am thinking she's needing some reassurance.", "she is insecure. nta\n\neveryone deserves time to themselves. she needs to get over it.", "NTA.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s a really normal thing to need to decompress after a work day and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re in therapy and preforming strategies for self care. Maybe your partner needs to do the same?\n\nI see a lot of people saying you\u2019re not communicating enough- which I don\u2019t think we have enough information to really weigh in on. \n\nYour partner definitely seems very sensitive to the fact that you need some space, which maybe she\u2019s just adjusting to the new routine and change of apartment. I feel like she is making something that\u2019s not personal against her, personal against her in her head. Maybe it would help to reiterate to her that it has nothing to do with her why you need some time alone at the end of your day.", "Nta - Fair warning : you better hide your journal and in all honesty destroy it if it contains anything that you don't want her to read. And I think you should consider using a journal app for your phone (maybe even pay for a one year or one time only permanent option) and write everything from the written journal to your app one, and do it when you go to the bathroom for an hour. Don't talk about the journal anymore with her. It's clearly making her self conscious and worry about what you are writing in it and she's probably wondering if there's anything about herself in your daily writings. \n\nSo just write in the bathroom and hush up about the journal. The reason I give this warning is because it makes no sense for her to start saying that it's weird of you spending time there etc....makes me wonder if she already has snooped around and read something.", "She is codependent and doesn't like being alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because it kinda sounds like neither of you actually understand what the other person wants. It is reasonable for you to want some alone time and it is also reasonable for her to be hurt that you're locking yourself away. \n\nIf you want the relationship to last, you need to work something out. If neither of you are willing to compromise at all, then maybe you shouldn't be together? Also, while you taking less than an hour to journal is one compromise, it's not the only one. Maybe there's a show or game that she's really into that you can suggest she do while you're journaling. Any kind of agreement could work.", "I mean, I just listed some random potential solutions, so you entirely missed my point: ask your partner WHY she is uncomfortable with it and then, see if a reasonable compromise to solve her discomfort is possible. Be pragmatic instead of defensive. \n\nThis new ritual may be working for you, but not for her. It doesn't really seem like you are concerned about that, only that it's disrupting your nice thing.", "It is fair for you to do that, and it could be fair for her to not want that in a partner and go a different way. 1 hour a day for the foreseeable future, if not the rest of your lives could be pretty inconvenient to some.", "Me having 1 hour a day to myself shouldn't be a problem and there is no compromise for it. My gf can entertain herself for an hour without needing me to be there", "1 hour a day is nothing, do you see your partner needing a short amount of time to themselves inconvenient?", "You are right. You having one hour a day to yourself shouldn't be a problem and I don't see a reason to have to compromise. \n\nHOWEVER: her reaction is very odd. It's worth having a conversation with her so you can UNDERSTAND her very strange reaction. This is part of being in a relationship: understanding why other people feel the way they do.", "Yeh, once again missing my point. Maybe it's not about entertaining. Maybe it's about her feeling like you don't want to share things with her. Maybe she misses you because she is feeling lonely. Consider options that do not compromise your hour, but make her feel better. That's a true compromise, you both give in a little, but gain together. But you can only know what makes her feel better if you stop arguing about what shouldn't be a problem, and hear her out without jumping to hasty conclusions.\n\nEdit: \n\nI honestly think it may be that she is feeling as if you are hiding from / excluding her.

If you weren't journaling but just wanted to sit and stare at the wall, an hour a day of alone time to do whatever is a really reasonable time. It's really weird to me that she feels entitled to every minute of your time when you're not working, it's not healthy.", "NTA-  it\u2019s an hour!  Your girlfriend is needy that you have to spend every second with her.", "NTA.  This is something your therapist has suggested you do for your mental health.  Sometimes it takes awhile to put your thoughts together & get them on paper.  She is being very selfish & unreasonable.  She is clearly feeling neglected, but she needs to understand you're doing this for your mental health, not to take time away from her.", "She definitely read your journal bro \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA and I'm sorry to say this but why does it look like your girlfriend is a bit controlling?", "NTA, you\u2019re being reasonable & you\u2019ve communicated your needs to her clearly based off what you have said in your post. Her feelings may be a bit hurt by it but just make it clear to her that it\u2019s not meant with malicious intent. Suggest she do a hobby to decompress while you journal?", ">She said I was being selfish by not considering how it's making her feel but I just said she was the one being selfish by refusing to understnad why I'm in the office and making it all about her. \n\n>She said I was out of order and that I was being unreasonable.\n\nShe said you're selfish but your use of the term is out of order? My brain doesn't like that.\n\nIronically, journaling is supposed to be about your own feelings being a priority so yeah it is going to be more about you than her. That's the point. And her hours changing doesn't mean your work day, which happens to include an hour of decompression (like someone going to the gym from work before coming home), changes too.\n\nHowever, the way to go about it can be tweaked to validate both of your perspectives. If she just wants you to sit with her, what if you both take an hour in the evening at the kitchen/dining table (a neutral space) and she does an activity of her own (she can even watch a show on one of her devices) with you there doing your journaling? Maybe just a few times a week instead of daily? Ground rules would be no talking for an extended period of time otherwise you go sit elsewhere. And you do get your daily 10 minutes of solitary silence on your own terms at some point.\n\n>She said it's still strange that I shut myself away after work instead of sitting in the living room with her.\n\nMaybe her problem is there is a shut door between you two, because it means something to her. Can you sit in the dining area while she's in the living room? Or keep your office door open? Maybe use a white noise machine instead of a door? What if you set up an area for her to join you in your office while you journal at your desk? It could be just a comfortable chair with a folding TV tray, which you can use during your work day also. Again, not necessarily every day but so that it is a semi-routine and she feels the flexibility.\n\nIf her being visible during your journaling is an obstacle for some reason, you need to communicate that and why complete solitude is going to be necessary. But please ask your therapist to help you so that everyone's feelings are respected. And ask your girlfriend to let you know if/when there are specific times when being near her would be more supportive to her, so you can support her like she's supporting you.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNTA", "If she can\u2019t handle an hour alone by herself, get her pregnant.

And it\u2019s personal so I don\u2019t blame you for wanting privacy.

NTA op", "It's all on my laptop so I know she hasn't", "Right. That might mean every so often he doesn't journal for an hour and does spend time with his spouse for the full night, but certainly not every night. Maybe some nights he can spend the whole evening in solitude to recharge. Same with her accepting that he needs time for himself. Seems like normal introvert/extrovert communication and compromise stuff to me."]}
