I\u2019m gay, but I\u2019m not attracted to my SIL at all. Throwaway because I think I\u2019m identifiable by my regular account.\n\nYesterday I was helping my brother and SIL with a landscaping project at their house. At one point my SIL and I were using a chemical fertilizer on the lawn and we weren\u2019t careful enough about not getting it on our skin /clothes, so afterwards we were both getting itchy red splotches on our skin. The warning label said to rinse immediately if that happened, so we both hopped into the shower for a couple of minutes. My SIL said she was also going to wash her hair, so I got out of the shower and she stayed in longer.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom my brother then asked me why the fuck I was in the shower with his wife, so I explained about the chemical fertilizer. He said I could\u2019ve used the hose outside if it was such an emergency, but he didn\u2019t see why I needed to get naked with SIL. I told him to chill out because I think of her like my sister. He said that he thinks of me like his brother, so to use my fucking head. My SIL was coming out of the shower by that point so we just dropped it, but he was still kind of pissed off about it the rest of the afternoon.\n\nSo AITA? I know I\u2019m gay but obviously my SIL isn\u2019t, so I feel like that makes this a complete non-issue. I\u2019d see my brother\u2019s point if there was any chance of mutual attraction.\n\nAlso, I tried to summarize to keep this short but I can answer any questions if people think that relevant details are missing.", "created_utc": 1681919158, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ryz3a/aita_for_taking_a_shower_with_my_sisterinlaw/", "score": 2064, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t get the comments about keeping bra and underwear on because in these situations, you need to remove contaminated clothing. In a lab environment, you\u2019d have access to an emergency drench, but the closest alternative in a house IS a shower. I\u2019m assuming that neither of you knew much about the consequences of what was in the fertilizer, and looking up the contents is less of a priority than getting it off if you\u2019re *already having a reaction*. It\u2019s honestly kinda shitty of your brother to accuse you of inappropriate behavior with his wife or describe you \u201cas a brother\u201d, because gay or not, you\u2019re a woman and saying \u201coh i view you like a straight man\u201d is kinda offensive, so I understand why you got defensive. I understand his insecurities, but his logic ain\u2019t there and a hose is not sufficient to remove chemicals. It\u2019s okay to freak out and act in haste, that\u2019s actually the right thing. This wasn\u2019t even a sexual situation to either of you, but an emergency. \n\nTalk to your brother and explain exactly this and why it\u2019s hurtful to you, as his sister, to be accused of not respecting your brother/trying something with your SIL, and that you guys were genuinely concerned about toxins/chemical damage to your body.\n\nI\u2019m glad both you and your SIL are okay, definitely invest in outerwear/gloves that can be easily removed for future chemical fertilizer application.", "As a straight woman I just have to say, the amount of homophobia expressed in some of these Y T A comments is absolutely and unforgivably out of control.

This was an emergency situation (albeit probably not a life-threatening one) and two women jumped in the shower together. A similar situation to what happens in locker rooms and spas eight gazillion times a day. The implication is that, as a lesbian, the OP is incapable of controlling herself sexually and all straight women have to \"beware, beware.\" The OP is deemed the ass even though the SIL suggested they both jump in the shower .

I shower with women all the time (gym), surely some of them gay (i never asked). Your SIL was ok with it. Your brother not. But shocker: he doesn't own your SIL, or het body.

You don't leave clothes on to do this and it wasn't like  you were in the shower playing and goofing off. It was a rinse, suds up, rinse, get out... At that moment you were having a reaction to a chemical that's the important issue. Yes, bisexuals and lesbians need to be cautious and respect others feelings, but your SIL was clearly comfortable in this situation. Given some of these comments, I almost wonder if they want separate locker rooms for lesbians and bisexuals. Ugh! Personally, I think I'm hearing a lot of homophobia here. Just because you are attracted to a particular gender doesn't mean you view every person of that gender as a target.

I\u2019ll be honest I think it was naive to not expect your brother to get upset while you showered with his wife, but that\u2019s not the issue for me. My biggest problem is that even after your brother tried to explain why he\u2019s not okay with it, you\u2019re trying to justify your actions. Yes, it\u2019s probably impossible that you and your SIL would ever do anything romantic together, but that\u2019s not the point to your brother. He might just not like the idea of her seeing you naked, I don\u2019t think my gf would ever give my brother a chance but I\u2019d be very upset if she saw him naked.

I don't like going to the bathroom with other people, but at a crowded nightclub, I have absolutely gone in to the single restrooms with multiple friends. Being itchy and wanting to wash off with someone you consider a sibling is not really that weird. \n\nAnd I do get why your brother thought it was weird (I think I would avoid showering with another person, but have plenty of people in my life who would be fine with it) and knowing you are attracted to women, can appreciate his feelings. For that reason, I would have gone N A H, but he approached this in a bad way. \n\nHe and his wife set boundaries about what is appropriate to do with friends/family/people of the opposite sex/people who are attracted to the gender they are.

I\u2019m gay, but I\u2019m not attracted to my SIL at all. Throwaway because I think I\u2019m identifiable by my regular account.\n\nYesterday I was helping my brother and SIL with a landscaping project at their house. At one point my SIL and I were using a chemical fertilizer on the lawn and we weren\u2019t careful enough about not getting it on our skin /clothes, so afterwards we were both getting itchy red splotches on our skin. The warning label said to rinse immediately if that happened, so we both hopped into the shower for a couple of minutes. My SIL said she was also going to wash her hair, so I got out of the shower and she stayed in longer.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom my brother then asked me why the fuck I was in the shower with his wife, so I explained about the chemical fertilizer. He said I could\u2019ve used the hose outside if it was such an emergency, but he didn\u2019t see why I needed to get naked with SIL. I told him to chill out because I think of her like my sister. He said that he thinks of me like his brother, so to use my fucking head. My SIL was coming out of the shower by that point so we just dropped it, but he was still kind of pissed off about it the rest of the afternoon.\n\nSo AITA? I know I\u2019m gay but obviously my SIL isn\u2019t, so I feel like that makes this a complete non-issue. I\u2019d see my brother\u2019s point if there was any chance of mutual attraction.\n\nAlso, I tried to summarize to keep this short but I can answer any questions if people think that relevant details are missing.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That would be wrong, no? I imagine your brother might think that if you haven't seen her bare body before, now that you're naked and showering together you *might* find her attractive/develop feelings. He's a guy, he's probably watched porn girl-on-girl shower scenes which would set his mind in overdrive!\n\nJust because you aren't attracted to your SIL doesn't mean that it's OK.

I do think your brother shouldn't have come at you like that but I understand why, in the moment, he was angry and surprised - that was a conversation for him to have with his wife though, not you. Once you explained the situation and that she was okay with it, that's something he needs to bring up with her instead of projecting his insecurities onto you.

Bro: 1/5 assholes.", "NTA - you were both in a situation and many women are generally more at ease getting undressed together than men seem to be. I would reiterate this was an exceptional circumstance where there were priorities and was about washing off the chemical you weren\u2019t \u201cbathing\u201d together or thinking of anything but rinsing off the best way possible and getting undressed etc to wash this off in the garden wasn\u2019t practical either.", "NTA. People who don't think someone can't see a naked body without \"wanting to hit that\"  are people who are constantly trying \"to hit that\". This is his problem,  not yours and not your SIL's.  And for him to pick a medical emergency as the hill he wants to die on fire this shows he cares more about hiding his own inclinations than about his sister's or wife's safety.", "NTA unless you were in there having soapy fun, which it sounds like you weren\u2019t.", "Onsen, the spa...dangerous chemical exposure? What is with people and trying to make everything sexual?? They're the ones making it weird sheesh. I've seen plenty of women naked...and it's totally fine...", "NTA.

You already know that though. He doesn\u2019t trust you, his wide or himself apparently. Ugh for you.", "NTA.\n\nI have a chem degree and work as a scientist now. Each of our labs have a shower in it and if we ever get anything dangerous on ourselves we need to remove all clothing from affected areas and use the shower then and there. The most important thing is getting the chemical off of you, not whether or not you\u2019re attracted to someone. \n\nIt\u2019s not a situation we\u2019ve really discussed, but I assume that if two people get chemicals on themselves they\u2019d both have to use it together regardless of gender/sexuality.", "Have you ever FELT a chemical burn? Or even just a chemical irritant? That shit is AWFUL. first instinct would have 100% been shower now and there would NOT have been any sexy time happening even IF we were attracted to each other because that is a BIG mood killer...", "I forgive you for this very bad take.  I'm sure in real life you have reasonable and humane opinions.  I'm sure when you're not on the internet you think clearly and have well thought-out positions.  \n\nI'm sure when you're in public you act much better than this comment implies you do.\n\nYou are forgiven.", "Happy cake day!!", "If the situation were different - the reaction would be different. Well done there mate. Great observation.", "I think it is hilarious honestly that he thinks gay people cant control themselves... and yet when you look at the statistics of assault i believe it is straight men who have taken the number 1 spot...", "You mention your SIL not being attracted to you, but are you attracted to her? Not saying what your brother said was reasonable or justified, just curious about the wording.", "Yeah when I read toilet water in GroupOk3447's comment I was like HOW can people say this.  Toilet is even worse at doing the job than a hose and a hose isn't best either because showers are the industry standard in chem labs where they have so many rules and regulations to maximize protection of staff since chemicals are no joke.", "That sucks.

He doesn\u2019t understand that women aren\u2019t like men and aren\u2019t constantly thinking with their \u201cdicks\u201d. Men are always sexualizing non sexual scenarios when it\u2019s honestly not that deep. So when OP got in the shower with his wife he just replaced OP with himself and what he would do in that situation. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so angry.

Surveys on this sub show 65-70%+ women. \n\nYou're also assuming they would react differently if OP was a straight man, showering with his SIL.", "Very much so. If this was a BIL showering with his brothers wife for any reason nobody would react in this way.", "I was 14/15 mixed comet and bleach while cleaning the tub and had the door closed but exhaust fan on.

The only thing I\u2019d maybe add is that when you are trained in these things most trainers emphasize it is NOT the time for modesty. Nor is it a sexy thing.

Let alone abut a family member. \n\nThe homophobia in these comments is staggering and disgusting.", "Sounds like internalised homophobia, right there. The 'optics' are just 'common porn tropes' and that's OTHER people's problems, not lesbian/ bi women's. I'm bi, and I don't feel any interest in women's bodies in the context of a shower with someone who isn't my partner. Gym showers are a thing, and in the situation of a *chemical irritant on the skin*, it's hardly a sexy shower together. This whole 'oh no what if they get the wrong idea of a lesbian in the shower with other women!' just reinforces the idea we can't bloody control ourselves sexually.\n\nNot to mention the brother clearly has some homophobia as he can't seem to conceptualise OP is a woman who's into women without making her 'a man' in his head.", "He thinks of his sister like his brother.  I.e. he sees her as a (sex crazed) man.\n\nLike, if we did some gender reversal and OP was a hetero male (rather than gay female), and his brother (sister) and wife were a lesbian couple, you could see how OPs sibling would think it were inappropriate for the hetero brother to shower with siblings wife.\n\nIt doesn't matter that SIL isn't attracted to OP,  sibling is worried that OP may enjoy the experience a bit too much.", "Someone I knew years ago called those thoughts \"the imp of the perverse\" and I've loved that ever since.

Your SIL is your sister \u201cby law.\u201d One ideation of the relationship is a lot more valid and a lot less insulting than the other. Viewing gay women as masculine simply for being gay is like a weird and stupid stereotype. Led me to hitting on a lot of straight girls w short hair before I figured it out. \n\nLike even without him getting offended at the shower thing it\u2019s problematic that he sees you as a brother to begin with because like\u2026 you literally have the same parts she does (unless you\u2019re trans sorry for assuming but then that makes his comment even more yikes) NTA", ">This wasn\u2019t even a sexual situation to either of you, but an emergency.\n\nI think a lot of straight people don't really understand how gay dynamics work. We can do platonic and sexual. It's the same kind of situation in a locker room. I'm a lesbian. I am attracted to women. I end up naked around other women. My brain does not automatically go to sexual attraction just because someone is naked. There is nothing erotic happening. If anything, being incidentally naked is less of a reason for being turned on - the nudity was approached functionally, not sexually. What a delight, someone is naked around me who was not naked because they wanted to be naked for me. Breath return to me.", "NTA", "What?? This sub is overwhelmingly women. There\u2019s loads of gender swap stories you can find to prove how biased it is towards women.", "100% this. This Monday I accidentally spilled formaldehyde all over myself (had to take down a container at above chest height that didn't have the lid secured at all by whoever had handled it before me). I was wearing the appropriate safety gear for the situation, but I got completely soaked, got it in my eyes (our safety goggles protect us from small splashes, not having liquid run from the top of the head and down), inhaled fumes, potentially got a bit in my mouth, the whole thing. Closest shower was in the middle of the hall so I had to strip out of my clothes and shower butt-naked in the hallway. My colleagues were kind enough to get out, but one of them had to help me rinse out my eyes. I was told the whole process took less than 5 minutes from the spill until I was cleaned up and wrapped in a towel. It was a fucking horrendous experience. I ended up getting a rash all over my body because of an allergic reaction and I am still having trouble breathing 3 days later. If you're subject to a chemical spill, you do what you have to do to clean it off. Your immediate concern should be your safety, not being modest. Even moreso if you're unsure of what you got on yourself.", "Australia is also very prudish, you can definitely add my country to the list"]}
