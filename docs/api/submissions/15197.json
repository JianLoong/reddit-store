I\u2019m gay, but I\u2019m not attracted to my SIL at all. Throwaway because I think I\u2019m identifiable by my regular account.\n\nYesterday I was helping my brother and SIL with a landscaping project at their house. At one point my SIL and I were using a chemical fertilizer on the lawn and we weren\u2019t careful enough about not getting it on our skin /clothes, so afterwards we were both getting itchy red splotches on our skin. The warning label said to rinse immediately if that happened, so we both hopped into the shower for a couple of minutes. My SIL said she was also going to wash her hair, so I got out of the shower and she stayed in longer.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom my brother then asked me why the fuck I was in the shower with his wife, so I explained about the chemical fertilizer. He said I could\u2019ve used the hose outside if it was such an emergency, but he didn\u2019t see why I needed to get naked with SIL. I told him to chill out because I think of her like my sister. He said that he thinks of me like his brother, so to use my fucking head. My SIL was coming out of the shower by that point so we just dropped it, but he was still kind of pissed off about it the rest of the afternoon.\n\nSo AITA? I know I\u2019m gay but obviously my SIL isn\u2019t, so I feel like that makes this a complete non-issue. I\u2019d see my brother\u2019s point if there was any chance of mutual attraction.\n\nAlso, I tried to summarize to keep this short but I can answer any questions if people think that relevant details are missing.", "created_utc": 1681919158, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ryz3a/aita_for_taking_a_shower_with_my_sisterinlaw/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She clearly didn't have any issue with it, and it takes two to tango, as they say.", "Yeah, it's pretty fucking weird to get naked and shower together. Why didn't you use a hose?", "NTA. What is wrong with everyone else in the thread? \n\nI\u2019m assuming both you and your sister in law are consenting adults. \n\nSecond, using a hose is nothing like using a shower, especially if the fertilizer was all over the place. \n\nThird, I get naked and shower with people right next to me at the gym, there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nIt sounds like your brother is insecure for some reason. But I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong.", "NTA (I really don\u2019t care that I\u2019m going against the grain here based upon these other responses).\n\nAs someone with a STEM background who\u2019s dealt with the consequences of spilled chemicals, it\u2019s clear you guys were freaked by the fertilizer spill and feelings of skin irritation. I don\u2019t get the comments about keeping bra and underwear on because in these situations, you need to remove contaminated clothing. In a lab environment, you\u2019d have access to an emergency drench, but the closest alternative in a house IS a shower. I\u2019m assuming that neither of you knew much about the consequences of what was in the fertilizer, and looking up the contents is less of a priority than getting it off if you\u2019re *already having a reaction*. It\u2019s honestly kinda shitty of your brother to accuse you of inappropriate behavior with his wife or describe you \u201cas a brother\u201d, because gay or not, you\u2019re a woman and saying \u201coh i view you like a straight man\u201d is kinda offensive, so I understand why you got defensive. I understand his insecurities, but his logic ain\u2019t there and a hose is not sufficient to remove chemicals. It\u2019s okay to freak out and act in haste, that\u2019s actually the right thing. This wasn\u2019t even a sexual situation to either of you, but an emergency. \n\nTalk to your brother and explain exactly this and why it\u2019s hurtful to you, as his sister, to be accused of not respecting your brother/trying something with your SIL, and that you guys were genuinely concerned about toxins/chemical damage to your body.\n\nI\u2019m glad both you and your SIL are okay, definitely invest in outerwear/gloves that can be easily removed for future chemical fertilizer application.", "As a straight woman I just have to say, the amount of homophobia expressed in some of these Y T A comments is absolutely and unforgivably out of control. People are suggesting that the OP should have washed herself in toilet water. People are questioning why she didn't leave her panties on when she jumped in the shower. This was an emergency situation (albeit probably not a life-threatening one) and two women jumped in the shower together. A similar situation to what happens in locker rooms and spas eight gazillion times a day. The implication is that, as a lesbian, the OP is incapable of controlling herself sexually and all straight women have to \"beware, beware.\" The OP is deemed the ass even though the SIL suggested they both jump in the shower . The OP is not an A H. But a lot of the others on this board sure are.", "idk I\u2019m a woman attracted to women, and I\u2019m always pretty conscious of the optics of being naked around other women/seeing them naked. It just feels extremely weird to me, even if I don\u2019t view them sexually at all. If anything it feels weirder if I\u2019m NOT attracted to them because I\u2019m like \u201coh fuck this is so awkward I don\u2019t want them to get any wrong idea about this and misinterpret a glance\u201d", "I\u2019ve had the experience of needing to strip quickly and rinse off something I was having a reaction to, as it was painful.

I would not have cared (in the moment) who saw me, but I may have later. \n\nFrom just that experience, I say NTA. \n\nIf I turn that around to my husband hopping in the shower with a woman\u2026 If it were an emergency decontamination thing, I\u2019d try to understand.

I'm guessing you live in the United States (as I do). Nudity and sex are NOT the same thing, and no one here seems to get that. Your being a lesbian is a red herring type of argument. Does your brother also think you shouldn't be allowed in women's locker rooms or in women's spas because you'll see another woman naked, lose your sexual shit, and just start jumping on people?", "NTA, does no one here go to the gym? I've showered naked with multiple strangers because that's the only option there. I don't like it, but I like being sticky with cold sweat on the way back even less; if I had some kind of chemical irritant on me instead of sweat, I'd be flying to the shower even if the entire gym population was in there.", "Curious though - did he get upset at his wife too?", "YTA, a cleaner one now, but an ass nonetheless...", "NTA being gay I\u2019m sick and tired of people thinking I\u2019m incapable of understanding the difference between a potential romantic parter and a friend or In this case a In law/ FAMILY member. If me and my brother in law both got a allergen CHEMICAL on us we could hop in the shower and it would not be weird. He needs to just get over it the situation warranted this reaction on your part. \n\n(Edit) I can\u2019t spell G\u016bd", "From my understanding of what your brother said, it's not so much the fact that you're gay, but rather that she's his wife, and actually, also family. As he said, he thinks of you like his (you wrote brother but I presume you mean sister?) sister. It sounds like he's saying that he's your brother but he wouldn't be getting in the shower with his sister. I doubt he'd get into the shower with your partner either.\n\nI do find it strange that you were both naked, but some people are comfortable being naked in front of family and friends. Others are not.\n\nPersonally, I would never get into a shower with an in law, or any family member, let alone be naked. I wouldn't even be naked with a close friend. \n\nHis wife also chose to be naked in the shower with you too, so she plays a role in this too.\n\nI guess he thinks that you overstepped boundaries.", "NTA. I feel like you are getting dog-piled here. I am a queer woman who has showered with my straight friends on multiple occasions. My best friends husband has never had a problem with it because me and my best friend  don\u2019t see being naked as sexual. I don\u2019t think you are the AH for doing it at all. However, since your brother has stated his boundary with it, maybe don\u2019t do it again lol.", "NTA, your bother is a bit homophobic if he thinks you being naked around his wife a threat to his marriage (which he clearly does). If you were straight he would not have cared, straight women are naked around each other with out issues, same with straight men, but the second you put a gay person in the mix suddenly the fact you're not interested in the person means nothing, they steal your agency and punish you for it. \n\nI'm so sorry.", "NTA  In many places around the world, same sex people shower together in shower rooms and no one has a problem with it. Doesn't matter if one of them is gay or not. The SIL didn't have a problem with showering with her.

I shower with women all the time (gym), surely some of them gay (i never asked). Your SIL was ok with it. Your brother not. But shocker: he doesn't own your SIL, or het body. I can sort of see why he was it upset, if I try hard enough. But the emergency of the situation (even if it turns out it was over reaction, it felt dangerous for you) and your explanation, he should have let it go.\n\nIf he wants to talk about it with his wife and set rules (don't shower with gay people of you gender), he needs to talk to HER, not you.\n\n(Disclaimer: Im European and not easily shocked by a Naked body)", "YTA. Gay or straight, male or female, I don't want anyone in the shower with my spouse.", "NTA. But from the dude perspective of 'guys can never have female friends cuz they're always really hoping to get a little something something ' and he perceives you as his brother, then he thinks you're always secretly creeping on his wife....

What a golden opportunity!!....yeah.....\nBut F his trust issues tbh", "NTA\n\nShowering is just that, showering.\nI don't get all these people sexualising this, but that might be because I'm Dutch, so my standards are different.

At least you know your boundaries, don't make a big deal about it.", "NTA\u2014ppl are so weird about nudity but the only opinions that matter are the ones of those involved.

Chemical reactions can go sideways fast. I may be uncomfortable but id shower with anyone to make sure the reaction doesnt go sideways.  Have they never been to a pool or a gym where ur lucky to have a curtain in the showers. And everyone is going naked while showering and changing. This wasnt a sexy time shower.", "NTA. Weird or not, you had no ulterior motives and your SIL consented. Neither of you knew the results of NOT getting the chemicals off your skin, it was perceived as an emergency, you both jumped in a shower to get said chemicals off. You didn't stay in any longer than necessary, I don't see what your brother's malfunction is, here. On top of that, if he's so upset about it, he should be upset at his wife, as well, not just you.", "NTA\nHis wife is not his property.

I shower and go in the sauna with women I have no idea who they are attracted to ... it's no bigarr\u00e5er deal, but if that's a problem for your brother I guess you know that for the next time you get chemicals on you. \nI don't think anyone of you is really an asshole. Just different.", "NTA, SIL was fine with showering with you, and that's the end of it. if your brother has issues, or find thats thats a boundary, that's between him and his wife, not you, and that blame doesn't lie on you", "NTA Bi F here... in the event of an emergency, getting rinsed off is the most important thing to do. You don't leave clothes on to do this and it wasn't like  you were in the shower playing and goofing off. It was a rinse, suds up, rinse, get out... At that moment you were having a reaction to a chemical that's the important issue. Yes, bisexuals and lesbians need to be cautious and respect others feelings, but your SIL was clearly comfortable in this situation. Given some of these comments, I almost wonder if they want separate locker rooms for lesbians and bisexuals. Ugh! Personally, I think I'm hearing a lot of homophobia here. Just because you are attracted to a particular gender doesn't mean you view every person of that gender as a target. For your brother to say he views you \"like a brother\" is disgusting.", "NTA people over-sexualize any situation and it\u2019s really weird. It\u2019s not like you went into the shower thinking ooooh I get to see her naked.", "NTA. The priority here is removing the toxic chemical from your skin not modesty and anyone saying otherwise needs help. The idea that your brother's sexual claim over his wife takes priority over physical safety is unhinged.", "YTAH, not because of what you did but because you aren\u2019t listening to your brother or putting the situation into perspective. I\u2019ll be honest I think it was naive to not expect your brother to get upset while you showered with his wife, but that\u2019s not the issue for me. My biggest problem is that even after your brother tried to explain why he\u2019s not okay with it, you\u2019re trying to justify your actions. Yes, it\u2019s probably impossible that you and your SIL would ever do anything romantic together, but that\u2019s not the point to your brother. He might just not like the idea of her seeing you naked, I don\u2019t think my gf would ever give my brother a chance but I\u2019d be very upset if she saw him naked. Not because I think they\u2019d fuck, I just don\u2019t like the thought of that. Maybe you should try to understand why your brother feels that way instead of justifying your actions or trying to figure out who\u2019s right", "Nta, the brother, has a problem, not the wife or OP. They are both women their sexuality has nothing to do with it. The wife had no problem showing with a woman who just happened to be gay. Op brother is the only one with a problem showing he doesn't trust his own wife or sister . They had chemicals that r dangerous n got it off. That is that, op, nor the wife saw it sexual only the brother.", "If my sisters wife and I were showering together when she came home, and she was angry, I think I\u2019d have an idea why. Regardless of entirely legitimate gardening context.

NTA. At all.nor is SIL.  But the brother is being ridiculous.", "YTA. It is weird for adults to shower together for any reason unless they're romantically involved. I'm confused as to how there was no other feasible way to rinse off the spots other than being naked in the shower together. A garden hose? A different shower? A sink? This makes no sense.", "YTA. You crossed a boundary you shouldn\u2019t have, plain and simple.", "I mean when chemicals are involved the need to be rinsed off is much more immediate. I went trolling through patches of poison ivy with a male cousin when I was younger and our moms stuck us in the bath together immediately because poison ivy took precedence over us seeing each other naked. \n\nAlso, straight people who think that being attracted to the same gender means you shouldn\u2019t be able to see people who have the same genitals you do are kind of bizarre in my opinion. (Source: am bi and have showered with women without wanting to jump their bones)", "Nta ofcourse, how often do guys and Girls shower together after sports? Just because she is gay it's a problem? It was as an emergency and not everything is sexual. If the same thing happend with me and my Bil no one would bat an eye in my family.", "NTA.  It just seems your brother is insecure.  I would still apologize to your brother for making him uncomfortable.", "Nta. You got off your contaminated clothes and took a shower with someone in the same situation.

How would you feel if a gf of yours jumped in the shower real quick with your brother? Fine with that? You said you were only in there a couple mins, why couldnt you have just jumped in first, and then SIL after? The whole thing seems pretty unnecessary and for that reason id say YTA.", "You\u2026. Showered naked with your sister in law? What? And you DON\u2019T think there\u2019s something wrong with that?!? YTA.", "ESH. I get that you are not attracted to your SIL, but you still took a shower naked with her. The line was blurry : in case of doubt, you probably should have abstained.\n\nAnd the fact your brother dropped it when SIL got out sucks. If this is a boundary he doesn't want her to cross, he should be discussing it with her too.", "NTA. Time was of the essence and clearly SIL didn\u2019t care. As you said, nothing sexual was in play, so your brother needs to calm down.", "NTA. Brother is allowed to feel whatever he wants but his feelings don't take precedent when the feelings that matter are the SIL's. Both OP and SIL are consenting adults and if it bothered the SIL she would have confronted it. \nNow that brother has shared his feelings, that's a matter for him and SIL to work out regarding boundaries in their relationship. \nBut def NTA for following a safety protocol.

I don't like going to the bathroom with other people, but at a crowded nightclub, I have absolutely gone in to the single restrooms with multiple friends. Being itchy and wanting to wash off with someone you consider a sibling is not really that weird. \n\nAnd I do get why your brother thought it was weird (I think I would avoid showering with another person, but have plenty of people in my life who would be fine with it) and knowing you are attracted to women, can appreciate his feelings. For that reason, I would have gone N A H, but he approached this in a bad way. \n\nHe and his wife set boundaries about what is appropriate to do with friends/family/people of the opposite sex/people who are attracted to the gender they are. He could have asked you WTF, listened to your explanation, and simply said \"I'd prefer you not do that again\" and then taken this up with his wife, and again not to yell at her, but to express HIS discomfort and reach a mutual agreement with his wife moving forward. \n\nThat's how adults in healthy relationships handle these things- oh hey, this is a new thing that we haven't experienced before and it makes me uncomfortable so can we talk about it and decide on X going forward?", "This thread is wild. The women were exposed to chemicals and showered together to limit their exposure and relieve their symptoms. One shouldn't have had to prolong their exposure and wait for the other to shower out of some misguided prudishness.

I think it is perfectly normal for someone with a gay sibling to be upset when that sibling got out of the shower with his partner. We aren't talking about highly hazardous stuff to the point you needed to get naked immediately and scrub down like a nuclear accident or highly toxic chemical spill. Its garden fertilizer.\n\nHow on earth do you not see this issue. I think its even crazier for you to think you'd just jump in the shower with your grown adult brother under the same circumstances.

Why\u2019s it worse when some water is added?\n\nPlus, I have gay friends although I\u2019m straight. One has a nice little pool. Two friends and I visited him one day and eventually ended up in the pool naked. Oooh, naked! Naughty!

I\u2019m gay, but I\u2019m not attracted to my SIL at all. Throwaway because I think I\u2019m identifiable by my regular account.\n\nYesterday I was helping my brother and SIL with a landscaping project at their house. At one point my SIL and I were using a chemical fertilizer on the lawn and we weren\u2019t careful enough about not getting it on our skin /clothes, so afterwards we were both getting itchy red splotches on our skin. The warning label said to rinse immediately if that happened, so we both hopped into the shower for a couple of minutes. My SIL said she was also going to wash her hair, so I got out of the shower and she stayed in longer.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom my brother then asked me why the fuck I was in the shower with his wife, so I explained about the chemical fertilizer. He said I could\u2019ve used the hose outside if it was such an emergency, but he didn\u2019t see why I needed to get naked with SIL. I told him to chill out because I think of her like my sister. He said that he thinks of me like his brother, so to use my fucking head. My SIL was coming out of the shower by that point so we just dropped it, but he was still kind of pissed off about it the rest of the afternoon.\n\nSo AITA? I know I\u2019m gay but obviously my SIL isn\u2019t, so I feel like that makes this a complete non-issue. I\u2019d see my brother\u2019s point if there was any chance of mutual attraction.\n\nAlso, I tried to summarize to keep this short but I can answer any questions if people think that relevant details are missing.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s not harmless just because they\u2019re both women. Lesbians are real and are sexual. Thinking it\u2019s harmless because \u201clol women can naked shower and be friends\u201d is ignorant and erases women\u2019s sexuality.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure he HAS taken this issue up with her.", "So, the wife should be perfectly okay with her husband showering with a woman?

His sister has a female body, like his wife, and is not attracted to his wife. I think there's a big difference between a brother, who's not attracted to his wife, showering with his wife, and his sister, who's not attracted to his wife, showering with his wife. Surely he'd be more comfortable with a woman showering with a woman, than a man showering with a woman, unless he's buying into homophobic tropes that gay people are attracted to everybody of the same sex. If she's not attracted to his wife, that aspect shouldn't be bothering him.\n\nI completely understand why the brother is bothered. Nobody would be comfortable with anybody showering with their partner, let alone nakedly. They could have, at least, kept their underwear on, but there shouldn't be a worry about a sexual element, if she's not attracted to the sister in law.\n\nI'm not sure why this is being downvoted. If she's not sexually attracted to the wife, it's no different to two heterosexual women showering together. They both have female bodies. A brother does not have a female body.

I don't believe this post, given your dramatic u-turn from vehemently denying that you're attracted to her, by now admitting that you are with your edit about **MUTUAL** attraction.\n\nYou have lost all credibility, and I'm now in minus karma for defending you against homophobic myths, when your edit has proven you to be lying.", "Again, if we've got time to think of the best option and not the first this wasn't the life and death emergency some people are making it out to be.", "If the reason he is concerned is because OP had previously got between the brother and a partner then that is justified. We unfortunately don't know anything about brother's state of mind and I wouldn't expect the OP to out herself if she was in fact a bad actor in some way related to brother. We don't know if he was aware of the chemicals on the skin or any of that. She doesn't reference his involvement in anyway till the interaction in question.\n\nShe was only in the shower a few minutes she said. I think for it to be ok, she should tell us the fertilizer. Jumping to the worst case scenario is not the right position to have.", "If it went through the clothes,that most likely means the clothes were giving them a rash. So getting rid of them quickly is what anyone should do.", "Did you not read she had to change out of those clothes and into all fresh ones? If she was wearing a flowy enough shirt, the chemicals were likely on her bra and would've just caused irritation all over again. When we have a chem spill at work, we have to strip all the way down and usually an HR person goes out and gets a new outfit for the affected person. Including fresh underwears of equal value we were wearing. She did the right thing.", "All men aren\u2019t attracted to all women either. I still don\u2019t want my brother showering naked with my wife.", "\"If you read the rest of the thread-\" Plenty of people have read the entire thread and the other ones you jump on bc you're so obsessed with finding someone to agree with you. Sorry, but most people just don't agree with you. It's why you're getting downvoted.", "It just seems a little disingenuous to me. I would go to the first water source I could find. Does this house only have one water source. Its just weird to me that OP thinks her brother shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. My assumption here is that there is a reason brohter/husband jumped to a conclusion but I may be wrong. We know noting of their relationship other than he was upset that she was in the shower with his wife.", "Would you be saying the same thing if she were straight?", "My first instinct if me and 1 other person are cover in chemicals that cause a reaction, with just the 2 of us, would be to go to the shower. Because as said, for the hose you need 1 person to aim. Both persons need to be rinsed", "It's not what anybody would do. People do not shower naked together. Only partners shower naked together. \n\nIf people are in a situation where they have to shower together, they shower in underwear or swimwear.\n\nThey could wash the chemicals off the bra and underwear with soap and water. You're making it sound like they'd been in a contamination zone for hours. They got a bit of spray on their arms and had a reaction. They don't need to be decontaminated.", "What do you mean cause irritation all over again? Did you not read where I said that she can take the washed underwear off after the shower and change into fresh ones?\n\nSo, now you've just made up what clothing she was wearing to fit your narrative.\n\nA chemical spill in work is no way on par with getting a bit of weed spray on the arms.\n\nI'm not arguing any further about this. You can all rationalise all you like, but there is no justification for showering naked with your brother's wife, irrespective of sexuality. It's intrusive and crossing boundaries.", "Yep.  Gay, lesbian, straight, I don\u2019t care.  Don\u2019t shower naked with someone else\u2019s spouse.", "Let's flip it another way. \nWould you still say op is n t a if he was a straight guy?", "Have you ever been in a situation like this? Years ago I got burned through my clothes, from my navel to nearly my knees. I immediately stripped off my shirt, pants, and underwear in the middle of the kitchen with no regard to who was around. My clothes were soaked in the boiling hot water that had spilled on me, and clinging to my injured skin. My only impulse was to get that off of me. At the emergency room, they told me it was the best course of action. If your clothing is at risk of causing you further harm, you remove it. In the case of chemical exposure, skin needs to be *thoroughly* flushed with water and that can\u2019t be done properly with clothing in the way. \n\nOn your other point: some people *do* shower together. I\u2019m a bisexual woman, my best friend is a straight woman. We\u2019re both married. If it\u2019s convenient, we occasionally shower together. Fully naked. It\u2019s never been remotely sexual or titillating; she\u2019s like a sister. Neither of our spouses mind. I don\u2019t expect everyone to be comfortable with that just because we are, but to say no one is ok with it is silly.", "And I didn't say that it's what anybody would do, I said should.. \n\n\nAnd anyways that's what I did when I was in a same situation, I ran into the shower alone sure. But I ran through my house butt naked cuz I didn't want any clothes that give me painful rash on me.. sure my mom, and my sisters saw me ran in naked but that was the last thing in my head at the time.", "Oh yeah ! \u00ab\u00a0Hey we have that burnt feeling on our whole body, let\u2019s juste change to put a swimsuit on before we go to the shower\u00a0\u00bb\nOr even \u00ab\u00a0hey I go to the shower so feel free being naked in the garden to use the hose\u00a0\u00bb", "I can't imagine mustering the energy to be angry at my spouse if she showered naked with someone to get chemicals off her.\n\nThis sub is so weird about naked bodies I feel like I'm double dosed on crazy pills.", "That wouldn\u2019t happen since if op was a straight guy he would have probably been drinking beer with his brother instead of helping in the garden.\n(Joke but not so much)", "Try reading the entire thread before assigning intent to me. I've spent hours pointing out why it isn't sexual and why people are buying into homophobic myths, and have been downvoted into oblivion for it.\n\nMy issue is not with a non existent sexual element, it's with crossing of boundaries. It is not appropriate to stand in a tiny shower cubicle showering naked with your brother's wife, irrespective of sexuality. It's crossing of boundaries and it's intrusive. The wife is also responsible here.\n\nNobody would like their partner showering naked in a tiny cubicle with another naked person, just the two of them alone.", "Your mother and sister saw you naked. They were not in a tiny shower cubicle showering naked with you. Massive difference."]}
