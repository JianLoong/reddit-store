Who's doing most of the parenting and does that have an influence on their respective investment in the romantic element of their relationship?", "Full body", "He's a stay at home dad, so I assume he leaves to go work out once she gets home, does it early in the morning before he leaves for work, or does it on the weekends while she's at home with the kids. And I think it's really important for the stay at home parent to be able to get out and take time for themselves, but it's unreasonable for him to expect her to do the same when she a) doesn't enjoy working out in a gym, and b) already has a physically demanding job and would prefer to do different kinds of physical activity than lifting weights."]}
