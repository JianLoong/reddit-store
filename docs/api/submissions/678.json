Now our son is 6 months old and my wife's family has started to combine our sons first name and middle name which completely changes his name.

My wife was very particular about picking out a name for him but now she says it's not a big deal to call him whatever they would like. I've tried to sit her down and ask her what she'd like to call him for short or if she'd like to go by his full name but she says I'm making a bid deal out of it.

He's 6 months old. Your wife is making her preference clear by calling him whatever she calls hims. Soon enough he'll be able to tell you what he wants to be called.", "NAH\n\nYour in laws can call him by his full name. That can be their special thing. I had a great uncle who always called me by my full name because he liked my middle name (after my grandmother). It made me smile because it made me think of him. My immediate family goes back and forth between two shortened versions and rarely use my full name. People are going to call your kid any number of things.", "YTA, sorry bud but no matter what you pick as a name, there will always be a way to change it to something you won't like", "Your Kid is 6 months old. Everyone has a baby name for every kid. Just sit back and watch him grow up. Eventually a Nickname is going to stick and you might hate it.

You and your wife can continue to call him by his first name only, but it\u2019s not like your in laws have given him some random or offensive nickname\u2014 they\u2019re calling him by a combination of his first and middle name.
