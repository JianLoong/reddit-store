{"id": 31717, "submission_id": "183s5t1", "title": "AITA for having my son removed from Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "My son Jeffrey (M25) has had massive anger issues for almost his entire life. It started when he was 14 or so, when he began yelling at me and his mother frequently; over the years, this continued, resulting in Jeffrey breaking video game controllers, getting in fights at school, and other overt displays of anger. We tried talking to him, grounding him, sending him to therapists, etc. but nothing seemed to be a permanent solution. During Jacob's sophomore year of college, he came back home from college for Thanksgiving break and had another display of anger that was essentially a 36-hour bender, and that's when me and my wife put our foot down and told Jacob that he was disinvited from Thanksgiving and that we'd be pulling him out of school to get him some help full-time. Once his semester ended, Jeffrey didn't come back home and we've been estranged since.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, everything was going great until about 2:00, when Jeffrey showed up unannounced for the first time in years. He'd managed to force his way in somehow and immediately rambled into the living room where everyone was gathered. He then began angrily ranting about how we'd ruined his life, detailing how he'd spent the last five years in dead-end jobs and was unable to have any friendships or relationships, and that he'd make us pay for abandoning him. Jeffrey noticeably reeked of alcohol when he came in, and I was worried for his safety. Me and Jeffrey's brother Scott stepped in and tried to de-escalate things, telling Jeffrey he was still loved and that we'd get him the help he needs. He then laughed and told me to fuck off, stating that it was too late for me to be the hero. He then continued ranting for a few more minutes before I called 911 to have him removed, and a few minutes after that the police came and dragged him kicking and screaming out of the house. I was later notified that they'd arrested him for DUI, since he was well over twice the legal limit. The rest of the family told me that I did the right thing here, but I can't help but feel a little guilty about how things played out.", "created_utc": 1700942568, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183s5t1/aita_for_having_my_son_removed_from_thanksgiving/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can\u2019t force him to get help and so the vicious circle spins.    \n\n\nNo matter what you do, it\u2019s going to hurt.  You do have permission to live your life without your son.

Now that he's an adult he's responsible for his own behavior and it sounds like he's got some mental health issues he's not addressing, and possibly is an alcoholic (bad mix with anger issues). You did the right thing having him removed, even though it resulted in him being arrested. Maybe this will be his rock bottom so he can finally get the help he needs.", "NTA.

There\u2019s no way he was charged with a DUI as the cops removed him from your home and he was not driving or operating a vehicle at that time.\n\nYour story\u2026 well it has some holes in it.

What was going on in your son's life at 14 that you and your wife ignored that caused his anger? Was he being bullied? Do you have other kids that you paid more attention to?

You're not entirely saintly here", "This is really unfortunate, NTA, but I can't help but wonder what happened that made him snap? He was 16 when these outbursts began, and while yes boys mature later than girls, these anger issues wouldn't have necessarily begun at 16, but rather 10 or younger and elevated into puberty. I'm not saying it's impossible, but this sounds more like unresolved trauma manifesting rather than the irate imbalance of a teen/young adult.", "Info - we can\u2019t really judge this.

You can't pull your adult child out of college.  That's between the college and the student.  He wouldn't be arrested for DUI for being intoxicated in a home.

Look into al-anon.", "Who's Jacob?", "Nta. \nThink he'll get a gun and try something?", "So what was the cause of his anger issues? I'd love to hear his view on his childhood...", "Not unlikely, given how he was acting. I'll help him get to rehab if he chooses it.", "Could have been stupid and admitting to driving there.", "My bad. From what the police told me, they found several open beer cans in his passenger seat and took that as probable cause for a breathalyzer test.", "I want to know where OP lives that the cops showed up that fast. I once had to call them because I heard my neighbors scream fighting and then one shot a gun and it went completely silent. They took 20 minutes to get there.", "It could also be something like bipolar rage. I've seen people with bipolar that if they're triggered will rage for a long time, sometimes even weeks. He definitely needs professional help. If the son learned that behavior from his father I doubt he would have exhibited it in front of his father growing up out of fear of retaliation. It also wouldn't be 36 hours of raging either.", "I didn't turn my back on him. He left on his own volition.", "Because he drove there & the police can prove he did.", "That's all you can do. As a recovering alcoholic and someone who has heard the stories of others from being in support groups for years. This is a total possibility. Addiction isn't just a standalone disease. So if he had emotional disorders it's very possible he turned to substances in an attempt to self medicate whether conscious of that or not.   \nAs the stickied comment suggests, support groups are a lifesaver. You absolutely did the right thing in this scenario. I'm sorry you're in this situation. But you're doing the right thing and have the right attitude towards helping him in the future.", "Very unlikely. Charges for DUI after the fact can be pursued, but they\u2019re much harder to prove. Even with an admittance, without any proof or witnessing it, I really doubt this happened. It\u2019s possible but not probable.", "Okay but what about *after* he left?", "How? OP doesn\u2019t mention anyone seeing him drive OR when he drank the alcohol. All they know is he is there and his car is there.", "The Canadian government changed the law so the cops can demand a breathalyzer up to 2 hours after driving and issue an impaired", "Because they can presume he drove his car, he probably told them that also. They can ask OP's family when he got there & then it's just a matter of math since he blew 2x the legal limit. OP also said he had open containers in the car, which is also illegal in most places.", "Is OP in Canada? I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re in the US since they\u2019re asking about Thanksgiving and that just happened here a couple days ago. I could be wrong though.", "They found a bunch of open containers in his passenger seat and took it as probable cause.", "Getting charged and arrested doesn't mean it'll stick either.", "Canada has a Thanksgiving, too. I'm pretty sure it's in October?"]}
