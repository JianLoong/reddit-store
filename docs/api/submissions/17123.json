You don't have to be \"grateful\" to your parents for raising you when it was literally their choice to have children. It's expected that they raise you. And while I think it should be expected to try your best to care for a parent who is elderly or disabled, that doesn't seem to be the case here. And you don't owe them anything at all if they treat you poorly.", "NTA, they've abused your hospitality far too long as it is.\n\nMake sure you check your local laws on eviction.

Do your research and start it now.  And, check to see if you can legally move their crap out if they drag their feet.   I\u2019m mean so after the 6 weeks when they hadn\u2019t left, I would offer to send them away for a long weekend, here is the hotel reservation, it is all paid for.  Then, while they were gone, the movers would come in, pack up their crap and put it in a storage unit.   The locks on the door would be changed.  They would get an email from me after it is done telling them that they have been evicted, here is the address and storage unit number, this is the code for the combination lock, the first two months have been prepaid and their mail is being held at the post office.  Have a nice life.   Yes, you would be shelling money out, but you do anyway, so a little extra up front to not have them in your home anymore is worth it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you were the parent and they were the  children, the response would be the same: you're not doing them any favors by enabling them to avoid responsibility.
