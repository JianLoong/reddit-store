I'm surprised you aren't hiding in your safe space 24/7.\n\nWhat you needed to do was sit down and talk to your roommate and find a compromise.  Maybe that is fewer decorations.

But in the end, it's compromise.\n\nAnd throwing away decorations takes it to a whole new level.  It doesn't matter if those were cheap Walmart decorations.
