FIL, his wife and her daughter went to Mexico for 2 weeks to visit a friend of theirs, and asked to borrow our GoPro. We gave it to them along with a few accessories including a spare side door (it covers the charging port, without it the camera is not waterproof) which can be easily broken off during charging.\nA few days later FIL asked me how to replace the door bc it broke off. I sent a video on how to replace it, he said it helped. I specifically asked whether he could properly close the door bc without it, water can damage it. He said yes. (Later it turned out that the door didn't brake, simply got off the GoPro, but I think that is irrelevant.)\nNext day he messaged me that water got into the GoPro and it won't turn on. We discuss it (let it dry, try again in a few days, don't charge until then, etc.) Sadly it doesn't work. I don't know whether the door had failed or they didn't close it properly or something else had happened.\nFIL said that their friend has a used GoPro8 which he can buy for $250 to reimburse us. Wife and I said don't buy it bc on the official website a brand new GoPro8 is the same price and obviously we would rather buy a new one for the same price. Additional info: you can't buy older models anymore. Furthermore we said to FIL that we would rather buy the latest model (GoPro 11) and we would pay for the difference, but don't worry about it for now, enjoy the holiday.\nThere was a discount on the website so we bought it right away for $400. They got home a few days ago and asked what should he pay. Wife said that we had to buy a few accessories too that we had for the old one but don't compatible with the new camera, in total we spent $450, pay the half and we are square (it is less than the used camera would have been). FIL said ok but made a strange face, I asked what is the problem and he said that they found used GoPro5 for approx. $100-125, so of course he would pay but he had hoped that it would be less. I said sorry but I would be afraid to buy a used one from strangers because I don't know the condition and if it will fail on me, especially if on a holiday, it would be bad.\nIn my opinion if you break it you buy a new one, but I completely understand he shouldn't buy the latest model, but I won't be satisfied with a used one either.\nIt is worth mentioning that we renovated our flat last year and he helped a lot for free. We never asked, he offered to help and won't expect or accept payment.\nSo AITA for expecting him to pay the price of a new GoPro and won't settle for a used one even though he helped us renovating recently for free?\n\nETA: he said okay to the deal on the phone during the holiday, that is why we bought it.

It wasn\u2019t a brand new GoPro, it was in used condition. \n\nYou really took advantage of this situation and forced him to pay far more than he should\u2019ve had to. If you want a new, shiny GoPro, you\u2019re responsible for paying for it, your FIL should only have to pay the cost of the broken device. \n\nHe should be paying $125 to your new GoPro and not more than that. \n\nBut, I really think the fact that he helped you renovate your flat for free is important here. Maybe he\u2019ll be smarter in the future and bill you both. Your father in law, based on that information, sounds incredible and shouldn\u2019t be taken advantage of.", "YTA. \n\nActually when you break something, you pay the amount it takes to fix it, or you pay for a replacement of equal value. Since your GoPro5 wasn\u2019t new, the replacement value of it is the market value of a used GoPro5, in this case $100-$125. \n\nFurthermore, your FIL is of the \u201cfamily helps family\u201d school of thought. That\u2019s why he was willing to help you renovate and refused to accept payment. \n\nYou could\u2019ve waited until your FIL got home and you both searched for a replacement camera together. You could\u2019ve come to a compromise and to find something for a price you were both okay with. Instead you chose to jump the gun and *immediately* overspend way more than your camera\u2019s worth without your FIL\u2019s ok. \n\nYour FIL loved you like family when he had the chance and you actively took advantage of him when you got a chance.", "Yeah YTA. Get him to pay you $125 towards the price of your new GoPro because that\u2019s the equivalent value of the one that was damaged in his care.", "YTA you should have just taken what the amount of the original camera that was damaged was worth.(125 in cash) Doesn't matter if he agreed to give you more. You shouldn't be greedy to your own family like that.  \n\n\nYou don't want a used go pro fair enough but don't expect a new one that's a whole lot more expensive. \n\nIf you had to borrow someones phone and you managed to break it by accident. Would it be fair that the person gets a phone that's worth a whole lot   more than their previous phone. (Like from a Samsung A series to an S series for example) then expects you to pay half for the S series phone? Shelling out 500 dollars for their 1000 dollar phone  because you broke their 300 dollar phone??\n\nWould you find that fair?", "Go pro 6yrs old (old ngl)\nOffered to replace but used                                Fil did free home renovations\nYeah you kinda ATA", "YTA not only did he help you in the past. But your taking advantage of him to upgrade your dinosaur go pro", "YTA. You used him to get a more expensive item. Dick move.", "YTA - a HUGE one. You totally took advantage of this situation to get a newer more expensive item. Accidents happen and they were ready to fairly repay you and took advantage of them. \n\nIn reality they should have replaced it with something similar or given you some cash based on the depreciated value. Not paid for a more expensive newer one.", "YTA. Enjoy doing all future renovations on your own.", "Sure, fair is fair.  You pay him the market rate for the renovation work he did for you, and he can pay for half of your new GoPro from that money.\n\nEdited for the judgment: YTA.", "Let me understand this correctly\n FIL agree to pay $250 to replace the broken GoPro5 with a GoPro8.\n\n>FIL said that their friend has a used GoPro8 which he can buy for $250 to reimburse us.

In this case the value of a working, used GoPro5.\n\nThe GoPro8, single owner replacement is a fair offer.", "YTA legally you are only due the value of the old GoPro. You don't get to get a brand new GoPro on your FIL's dime. You, quite frankly, are taking advantage of your FIL.", "YTA. You are taking advantage of the situation so that you can get a newer, shinier toy.", "Info: how much money/time did he spend helping you renovate?", "NTA. He broke it, he buys it new. Sounds like you were fair in what you asked him, and I'd stick to it. \n\n(ETA: I see that I'm the only person on this thread so far who thinks NTA - but have read the other opinions and I'm sticking with mine. If I were him I'd be mortified that I broke an expensive item that I had borrowed from somebody, and I'd be bending over backwards to make it right.)", "NAH\n\nI think you're technically correct but alsooo, eh it's so hard cause you are again, technically correct.\n\nSo, you're taking a you broke it you buy it-I respect that.  You're also kind of playing what it takes to replace the item at current market value--if this was your go pro ruined in a flood your renter or homeowner insurance would give the money to replace it.  But that guy is your friend.\n\nFor me it's the part where you add up the extra accessories that I'm just having trouble staying on your ride.  And while you point out the newer models are more cost efficient, my man you've got a serious upgrade.\n\nI also see your friends point: the item was used, or gen 4 why not provide that as a replacement.  Or why not say \"we will accept x\" and let them shop around.  \n\nYou kind of with no prior discussion bought the upgraded model, added like accessories and paid on total without ever reaching agree ment on what they would pay.\n\nI don't think your 6 year old go pro is worth over $400, and I think it's really wise not to loan money or things we can't afford to lose.\n\nYou, op, can be described as technically correct but are putting a big strain on the relationship here.  I would really consider moderating this offer.  Setting aside replacement cost, what did you realistically spend at the time and has it really depreciated 0% in value.\n\nIf you were insistent will all new this that and then just said you owe x (whether 1/2 or full amt) I would probably pay you, but I'd remember this as you taking advantage of an accident to upgrade your shit). We would not be as close anymore.  I would withdraw.\n\nI think a value between your new replacement cost and Thier used replacement proposal is best.
