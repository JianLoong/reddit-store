I saw a lot of comments that my SIL is 6 weeks early, she\u2019s not. She\u2019s 36 weeks (37 weeks is considered full term), the doctors are optimistic that the baby will be totally healthy (it was a normal pregnancy), just will need NICU to be sure of things like sugar levels and oxygen levels before being released. \n\nIf something is very wrong my parents will get on the next flight available, and of course there is no question about that - I didn\u2019t make it clear in my original post that nobody was calling this a horrible emergency scenario from the get go. It\u2019s scary, but 36 weeks isn\u2019t a horrible scenario medically and the doctors were reassuring from the beginning that they believe the baby will be totally healthy, the NICU is a precaution. If there is some problem down the line my parents will get on the next plane. If all goes okay with the induction they will leave a day earlier than planned (5 days from now). \n\nI appreciate all the feedback, I am obviously hormonal and emotional at the moment and I posted here to get other perspectives so thanks for sharing all of yours, I appreciate all the honesty. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nI live across the world from the rest of my family, about a 12 hour flight. I see my parents 2-3 times per year. \n\nI gave birth 2 weeks ago and my parents flew to help me with my 3 year old and newborn postpartum. It\u2019s been really helpful and they\u2019re supposed to stay one more week and then fly home. My son is obsessed with them and he has the time of his life when my parents come visit (twice a year). It\u2019s been great and so helpful. \n\nMy SIL is due in a month with her first. She has a strained relationship with her mom and is very close with my mom. My mom promised her she\u2019d be there for the birth, figuring with 6 weeks between our due dates it would work out. \n\nWe got the call today that my SIL water broke and my mom immediately said \u201cI need to change my flight, I promised her I\u2019d be there.\u201d I love my SIL, we are very close and I don\u2019t want to deprive her of the support she was relying on, especially with this sort of scary situation. But at the same time, I can\u2019t help it, I want my parents to stay until the end of their trip. \n\nMy son is expecting them to be here for another week, and I\u2019m only 2 weeks postpartum, I\u2019m still healing, and also my mother\u2019s helper is only set to start working for me next week. My husband works very long hours and I am nervous to take on my toddlers bedtime plus a newborn without any help at this point. \n\nMy parents live fairly close to my brother and SIL and will be able to be much more involved and helpful than they are with me since I live so far away. I really cherish when they\u2019re here and I don\u2019t want them to cut their visit short. My SIL will have their help whenever she needs in general. I only get it for this short time. \n\nBut also this is my SIL first baby and I truly want her to have the support she needs, I don\u2019t want to be selfish about this. My parents didn\u2019t even ask me my thoughts on it, so I don\u2019t know if it even makes sense for me to ask them not to change their flight, but WIBTA if I did ask? I think if I was honest with them they would stay, which would leave my SIL without their help for her first week postpartum.\n\nETA : the doctors told my SIL that the baby will need to stay in the NICU for a bit after birth, which my mom feels means that my SIL needs her even more. Would love to hear from parents who\u2019ve had baby\u2019s in the NICU, is it especially cruel if I deprive my SIL of my parents support while her baby is in the NICU?

Then your dad can fly back a week later and join your mom. Might be a good compromise option.\n\nLeaning N A H. The other commenters say you're being selfish, and you kind of are....but you're 2 weeks post-partum with a toddler and a newborn. It's understandable you're feeling this way. But I think your SIL could really use the support, and ultimately it's up to your mom.", "NAH. Your mum wants to support your SIL, but you also want the support you thought you were getting. \n\nIs it possible to talk to your parents, rearrange your mum's flight so she is there for SIL but maybe have your dad stay for the next week?", "NAH. She potentially won\u2019t even make it back for the birth depending on flights and how long labor lasts. If the baby is in the NICU for a while, your mom can be there for them emotionally and to support SIL with extra care but can\u2019t do much else until baby goes back home. I feel like the compromise would be that dad stays with you and mom goes home. Then maybe she can plan another trip to come visit soon as well. If this happened to me, I would be upset that mom wants to leave me when she said she\u2019d be there to help me x amount of time.", "NAH\n\nYour mother sounds like she's set on this so regardless of how you ultimately feel about it, it'd be a good idea to see if that helper can start a week earlier. That or your husband burn some vacation days.", "Nicu parent here.\n\n\n\nOnly me and dad could visit baby and one at a time.  You have to remember there are multiple babies on nicu floor and the protocols are strict. This was precovid. No idea what it is like now. \n\n\n\nYour parents need to quarantine when they get back. Especially after an international flight before they go in, because other people's babies matter just as much as theirs. That is if they are even allowed in to the nicu. They should find out the protocols and requirements.\n\n\n\nNAH", "My son had a bit of a different NICU experience because he was admitted a month after birth having been home with me for that time but I can\u2019t imagine not having had the support from my parents and in-laws I had while he was there. It\u2019s terrifying having your child in the NICU. Our family/friends brought me and my husband food because we\u2019d forget to eat or only survive on UberEats if they didn\u2019t, they sat with him so we could go home and sleep or shower, they helped us figure out what the medical diagnosis his doctors were telling us about meant for his future, they listened and held me while I cried, they took on the burden of updating our close friends/family who we were giving Daily updates to so we didn\u2019t have that mental load, my siblings sent little gifts just to help cheer us up, when we needed something they made sure we had it. As awful as it will be for you to have your mom leave early, from the sounds of it your SIL may need her more. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still use your mom\u2019s help or that you\u2019re wrong for wishing she could stay, it just means that the situation sucks and there is no one good answer just one slightly less bad answer. Yes, you could definitely use help, recovery is hard as is caring for toddlers; but, what is also hard is giving birth early (so before you\u2019re prepared) and then while you are recovering also having your child in the NICU while you wonder if they\u2019re going to survive or if they\u2019ll ever be a normal healthy baby. A month early isn\u2019t as dangerous as it could be but baby still hasn\u2019t finished developing, your SIL is giving birth knowing her child will only survive if machines keep them alive and even then they may have lifelong health problems caused by being born early. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry your family is going through this, it\u2019s hard and unfair for all of you. I hope you\u2019re all able to get through this struggle safely and without any lasting hurt feelings. Would it be possible to sit down with your mom and explain how you\u2019re feeling without asking her to change her flight? Or maybe she could talk to your SIL and see what she thinks? She isn\u2019t the one who said your mom needed to change her flight, your mom is.

They could bring an illness in that could kill all the babies there. They can't help with baby. I don't see why your brother can't look after his wife for a week. But over all, this is simply something that your parents should not be unilaterally deciding. They need to ask your SIL what she needs. And they need to ask you what you need. They made promises to you both and they need to reach a new compromise. Your parents promise to SIL is equal to the promise they made you. I know I always felt like I was hit by a bus for 3 weeks after giving birth. Your SIL doesn't have another child to look after.\n\nI think new solutions are needed. Maybe your partner takes another week off. Maybe your dad stays with you for a week and you mom goes. \n\nJust a crappy situation. NAH.", "NTA. And I\u2019m really sorry for the mean comments on here. People can be ruthless and unfeeling. Of course you want your mother with you. You\u2019re postpartum and It\u2019s your mom, so you have every right to feel how you feel. Whether or not you ask her to stay is really a function of how you want your mother to feel. She made a promise and wants to keep it. She\u2019s probably very worried and will feel better if she\u2019s with your SIL as soon as possible.\n\nRespect your own feelings and tell your mother you really wish she could stay. Respect your mother\u2019s feelings and tell her to travel safely and to return soon.", "NAH. But this is one of those times where there are no good options. Either your parents go to your SIL OR they stay with you. I say that as I saw the comment your father didn't think staying without your mom was important, but you could also ask him to stay to see his older grandchild.  \n\nYour SIL is going through what you did, but with added worry and concern as her baby will be in the NICU when she gets released. And this is all up in the air, labor can go many different ways. \n\nLet your parents go, and be mad at the situation, not any person.", "NAH You have had your mom and dad for two weeks, seems like SIL on has your brother you and your parents for support. This is a scary time for BOTH of you but Thank God your child is healthy and home with the parents you.

Best of wishes to all.", "NAH this is a rough time for your family and there are no good answers. FWIW our twins were six weeks early and spent 9 days in the NICU. It\u2019s a tough time and while I was glad my mom was with us, there was honestly not much to do while they were in the hospital. The doctors and nurses had everything under control so the time we really needed help was when the boys came home. There\u2019s no way your mom will make it home in time but can you compromise by having your dad stay until the mother\u2019s helper starts?", "Info why can't dad stay and help and mom leave early?  They're a couple, but they aren't atrached at the hip.", "Nobody has asked why is the husband at work in these circumstances? Maybe he does live in a heartless capitalist system with no paternal time off, but why isn't the question being asked? Where's the husband?", "I needed the least amount of help when my kids were in the NICU. I needed more help when they got home. I'd ask your mom to hold off, but that's me and I didn't want anyone else with me during delivery.", "I have no judgement for you. You asked to hear from parents who had a NICU baby. I had a NICU baby. Let me preface this by saying that everyone\u2019s NICU journey is going to be unique. \n\nMine came three and a half months early. I was a hot mess. My hormones were all over the place. My thoughts were all over the place just trying to get life done and NICU life done. It was extremely terrifying. Things change rapidly in the NICU and doctors honestly cannot always predict how a journey is going to go. For my son\u2019s journey it was one small step forward, two giant leaps backwards. My parents were there to support me right after my son came. They stayed for a week. But then every weekend they came to visit me and my son in the NICU until he was released. \n\nIt is terrifying leaving the hospital without your baby. I had a meltdown shortly after leaving the hospital and realizing my son was still in there\u2026even though I knew he needed to be there. It was hard. I would hate for anyone to be alone when that realization hits. \n\nI am so sorry you are stuck in the middle.

Seems like a lot of the respondents haven\u2019t had a NICU baby. Ours was born at 29 weeks, had some developmental abnormalities, and spent over three months in the NICU. An otherwise healthy baby, she just required monitoring to watch her ABCs and that she was eating. \n\nIt was multiple daily trips to the hospital for both parents, and no other family was permitted in (pre-Covid). In our time in the NICU,  most babies spent a day or two then went home, and only 2 babies that stayed there longer than ours with some significant birth defects. \n\nThere isn\u2019t much your mom could do to help your SIL, and it seems like she has a  support system already in place where she is giving birth, whereas you do not. \n\nI\u2019d just be honest with you mom on how you feel.", "NAH. I feel like you both need your parents at the moment. If both parents are at your house, let your mother fly home and dad can help you the next week.", "[deleted]", "NAH. It\u2019s perfectly fine to what your parent to stay longer especially since you don\u2019t see them often but it sounds like your SIL and brother need your mom now. \n\nAs for my experience, my twins were born at 26 weeks and spent time in the NICU. One stayed locally in the unit for two months, the other had to be moved to a larger one 3 hrs away due to a medical emergency for 3 months. I also had a 1 year old, a 5 year old, and 7 year old at home. My husband also works long hours and had to change his schedule around so he was home in the evenings more and not work overtime on the weekends so we could visit our newborn that was 3 hrs away. I also couldn\u2019t drive for a short period of time because c section and had to wait in the evenings for my husband to drop me off to visit with the twin who was local. My family was helpful; my father and sister would take me up to the out of town twin or watch the kids while my husband and I went. I didn\u2019t have much help in the day to day activities. \n\nMy point being is that your sister in law may not need much physical help (depends on your brothers work schedule, so she may need that too) but more emotional help than anything. Having your child in the NICU fighting for their life is one of the hardest thing for a parent and my mind went into some pretty dark places not knowing if they were going to be coming home. It\u2019s also incredibly depressing having to be healing in the hospital with no baby while everyone else around you is coming to visit their new bundles of joy. I had to walk up and down the hallway to heal from my surgery and pass the nurses bringing babies to their mothers room and family bringing balloons and gifts, crying the whole time.", "YTA- in a soft way. Don\u2019t put your mom in the middle like that. It\u2019s her choice. She wants to be a good mom to you both but you have safely come through the birth of your second child and now she needs to support her son and his wife on the stressful events of their first birth.\n\nYou are assuming the outcome will be fine. If it isn\u2019t, your mom will never forgive herself for not being there supporting them.", "I think it depends on the baby\u2019s condition. Our first was born 5 weeks early and had apnea, so he would periodically just not breathe. Other than that he was perfectly healthy. This was 20 years ago,  and at the time parents were allowed in the NICU from 7am - 7pm. Our baby was in there a couple of weeks. \n\nBetween the doctors, nurses, and machines monitoring him, we weren\u2019t particularly worried. We took advantage of the time to recover from a stressful pregnancy, catch up on sleep, and even went on a couple of dates.  We figured we should take advantage of having the best babysitters in the world since we weren\u2019t allowed to be there at night. We were only a phone call away and made sure that one of us was in the NICU the entire time we were allowed. \n\nIf the baby has serious health complications, SIL will need a lot more support. Is she\u2019s able to visit around the clock, she\u2019s going to want someone to sit with the baby so she can eat and sleep. And maybe would want someone to take care of dishes and laundry at home. \n\nI think the most important part for her isn\u2019t necessarily the time in the NICU though. She\u2019s never had a baby and she\u2019s going to feel worried and alone. Sometimes additional stress during the birth can affect the outcome. \n\nI totally understand why you want your mom, but it sounds like you are in a better situation than SIL.

My son was born early (35 weeks), but thankfully, he didn't need to go to the NICU. It was night and day difference for me postpartum. \n\nIt may be challenging being at home with your baby and toddler while your husband is at work, but maybe you can ask a local friend for help or even to just come visit?

I see my parents 2-3 times per year. \n\nI gave birth 2 weeks ago and my parents flew to help me with my 3 year old and newborn postpartum. It\u2019s been really helpful and they\u2019re supposed to stay one more week and then fly home. My son is obsessed with them and he has the time of his life when my parents come visit (twice a year). It\u2019s been great and so helpful. \n\nMy SIL is due in a month with her first. She has a strained relationship with her mom and is very close with my mom. My mom promised her she\u2019d be there for the birth, figuring with 6 weeks between our due dates it would work out. \n\nWe got the call today that my SIL water broke and my mom immediately said \u201cI need to change my flight, I promised her I\u2019d be there.\u201d I love my SIL, we are very close and I don\u2019t want to deprive her of the support she was relying on, especially with this sort of scary situation. But at the same time, I can\u2019t help it, I want my parents to stay until the end of their trip. \n\nMy son is expecting them to be here for another week, and I\u2019m only 2 weeks postpartum, I\u2019m still healing, and also my mother\u2019s helper is only set to start working for me next week. My husband works very long hours and I am nervous to take on my toddlers bedtime plus a newborn without any help at this point. \n\nMy parents live fairly close to my brother and SIL and will be able to be much more involved and helpful than they are with me since I live so far away. I really cherish when they\u2019re here and I don\u2019t want them to cut their visit short. My SIL will have their help whenever she needs in general. I only get it for this short time. \n\nBut also this is my SIL first baby and I truly want her to have the support she needs, I don\u2019t want to be selfish about this. My parents didn\u2019t even ask me my thoughts on it, so I don\u2019t know if it even makes sense for me to ask them not to change their flight, but WIBTA if I did ask? I think if I was honest with them they would stay, which would leave my SIL without their help for her first week postpartum.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A newborn is stressful at the best of times, and you\u2019re managing that with a toddler and a partner who unfortunately isn\u2019t able to pull as much of the baby raiding weight as you.

The nursing staff handles basically everything for you while you're there, and visiting hours are often limited, so if a grandparent has a certain amount of time they can stay, it makes the most sense for it to start after everyone's home. \n\nAlso, in my experience, grandparent support is absolutely the most valuable with the older sibling. Dealing with a single newborn is a cakewalk compared to newborn + toddler.", "I had my twins at 30 weeks. They spent more than two months in the NICU.\nI wanted no one but my husband around. I have a completely peaceful relationship with my mother, there are many a times in my life when I wanted her by my side.\nThis was not one of those times. I know that so many women want their mother to be with them, but for me, at that time, I couldn\u2019t handle anyone else and their expectations or needs. Literally no one else mattered to me in those moments but those babies and their father.\n\nThis is just to tell you that every person, every situation, every birth is different. \n\nNTA", "NAH/NTA. I have been in your shoes. My mom left while I was still in the recovery room after having my second baby so she could be with my sister, who was having her first baby. That first night home with a toddler and a newborn was *so hard* without help. (I was exhausted from labor and delivery, but both my husband and I had to each be up with a fussy child, as we had no other help.) Meanwhile, my sister was still in the hospital so had both nursing care for her newborn, her local in-laws, and her spouse (as this was their first baby, and they didn\u2019t have any other children to care for). \n\nI\u2019m still a little salty, but I\u2019ve never said anything, because of course my mom wanted to be there for my sister\u2019s first baby. I don\u2019t blame her, but it was sure a bummer for me\u2014we could have used the help, and any other time, she would have happily been there for us. Years and years later, it\u2019s great having same-age cousins, though!", "NTA", "The clear solution is your mom goes to SIL and you dad stays here. I presume he is a capable adult, right?", "Yta.\n\nMy first pregnancy ended up with me being induced at 36 weeks due to extremely low fluids despite there not being a leak of any size, and the baby measuring small suddenly and decreased movement. This happened suddenly, two weeks prior everything was fine.\n\nBut because I was not anywhere close to being ready for labor, the induction took 3 days, and I was monitored the entire time because I was begging to avoid a section.\n\nMy baby was born weighing 5lbs and was 15\". By some miracle, we avoided NICU, but I was petrified about it. I have no family in the area and my inlaws worked.", "YTA. Its your moms descision and I dont see why you cant ask.

Things change and evolve!", "lmao YTA\n\nYour parents came to be with you to help and have been there for two weeks. Now someone else in your family needs their help and you\u2019re being selfish.\n\nYour son will see them again. They\u2019ve helped enough.

It's been over a year since our son was born and my husband is still hurt over this. I get that a new baby is tough and you want your mom there, but not only will your SIL need the support, your brother will too. His wife will be super emotional, and his child will be in the NICU, he needs his mom too.", "In my opinion both new moms would be \"selfish\" to deprive the other of the mother's support. It's not really relevant.", "It was only two visitors at a time and one parent had to be a visitor so we didn\u2019t have anyone really  come see our NICU baby n this was just a few months ago. So i don\u2019t really see the reason the parents should rush home. They can\u2019t see the parents or the baby without quarantining themselves for at least about a week. Rather safe than sorry.", "Agreed. My preemie was born (pre-COVID, but during cold/flu season) at 31 weeks and was in the NICU for 31 days. I actually don\u2019t even remember seeing my parents at all during that period. If I wasn\u2019t at the NICU, I was home pumping or sleeping. It was only after my son was discharged that my parents visited. Even then, they didn\u2019t visit more than a few times because this was what NICU doctors recommended: to limit exposure to household members only until he reached six months of age. Promise or not, much of what happens when a baby enters the NICU is determined by hospital policy; and then, after discharge, advice from doctors. OP\u2019s parents should definitely look into this and discuss with their son and DIL before rushing home.\n\nNevertheless, NAH.", "Why is this not higher. In many hospitals you cannot enter the NICU if you\u2019ve been traveling. They also usually only allow one other person beside the mother which is normally the father. Why can your brother support his wife during this time? I had a NICU baby and there was nothing anyone could do to help me but maybe clean or grocery shop while I sat in the NICU. I\u2019m going NAH. But your family needs to be realistic on what they can do while the baby is hospitalized and focus on what to do when they\u2019re all home.", "Yeah this would honestly break my heart if my mom did this. I'd feel like she replaced me with my SIL. Rational? No, probably not, but SIL is going to have OP's mom's support for years to come, whereas OP gets her twice a year. \n\nI don't want kids so I may be overestimating the pain and horror of the postpartum period but I feel like I'd be so upset.", "Except it's not just SIL but SIL's husband too. You know OP's mom's son. Doesn't he also deserve his mom in this scary time where he's having to see his wife and baby at risk?", "Thanks for this! My girls were both born on their own terms at 36.5 weeks and both were totally fine normal healthy newborns. No feeding issues, no excessive jaundice, no breathing issues, etc. Second baby passed her car seat test and we actually went home when she was 24 hours old (my request.) I totally understand there are risks to late preterm babies but it\u2019s not in any way the same level of risk as a 32 weeker or something!", "I think this comment is exactly on point. My mom is wonderful and I don\u2019t want to put her in a position where no matter which choice she makes she feels like she\u2019s letting down someone she loves. \n\nI think I was sort of nervous also that it might be a situation where my mom jumps into action and then it ends up being that she\u2019s not even allowed in the NICU after flying from a different country or something and she ends up not even being able to help until next week when she would\u2019ve been back anyway. \n\nAnd we\u2019re not set to see my parents again for 9 more months, the next time they\u2019ll see my daughter she\u2019ll be 9 months old and the next time they see my son he\u2019ll be 4 years old. We get so excited for their visits and I guess also my feelings were kind of hurt how they discussed the flights. \n\nMy mom suggested maybe my dad stay while my mom flies back and my dad was kind of like \u201cthere\u2019s no reason for me to stay if you\u2019re leaving\u201d, neither of them made any sort of comment about my recovery, or how I would handle them getting on the next flight. I\u2019m sure they were just focused on my SIL and weren\u2019t thinking about it, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling kind of hurt, like I\u2019m still pretty freshly postpartum and I so rarely get to be taken care of by my parents, and sometimes people just want their mom and dad during vulnerable times and this is just one of those times for me. \n\nYour comment makes it really clear though that of course I don\u2019t want my mom to feel like she\u2019s in an impossible situation, I really appreciate your comment. \n\nIn the end, I didn\u2019t speak to my parents but they decided to shift their flight back by only one day unless something goes wrong, in which case they\u2019ll get on the next available flight.", "Then why NTA and not NAH?

I think he more just wants to be there for my mom, who recently beat cancer and has the habit of neglecting her own needs while she\u2019s taking care of others.

My husband has no one else to cover him at his small business  - if we have a second child he would have to go right back.", "Agree, NTA. With my NICU babe it was only parents allowed in and I was so busy that I could barely speak to my parents (who I\u2019m close enough to to only live a few doors away from) with all the back and forth and pumping every 2 hours and my own recovery. After was when I needed the help - and it sounds like SIL & bro will get a lot of that when the grandparents are home from this short trip.", "I\nEveryone keeps saying mom promised SIL, but didn\u2019t she also promise OP?", "Seems like Brother will be there but because SIL has a bad relationship with her own mom she\u2019s in need of maternal support.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

My god daughter spent a few weeks in the NICU and I would visit her with her mom as well. Your SIL, depending on how she is, may need/want more mental support.

In fact that's the week the baby's lungs are finally fully developed, so it's considered early term. \n\nACOG and SMFM use these definitions to describe term pregnancies: Early term: Your baby is born between 37 weeks, 0 days and 38 weeks, 6 days.

But IMO the hierarchy in this delicate period should absolutely prioritize the newly postpartum daughter who won\u2019t get to see her mom again for 9 months over the son who lives nearby and will have that emotional support in the days to come, especially because there is little OP\u2019s mom can physically do for them until a later date anyways and OP needs the *physical* support.
