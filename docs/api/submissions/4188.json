My ex husband and I separated recently, we have two children together and I have two of my own from before we were together. After the split my ex husband's parents has been constantly saying that my youngest isn't their granddaughter. Their reasoning is that because my older daughter and younger daughter look alike they must be full siblings instead of half. Pretty much they are saying I cheated and got pregnant with an ex. \n\nBoth my girls look like me. I never cheated. I am 100% certain that my youngest is my ex husband's. I told my in laws to go get a DNA test but they would have to pay for it because they are questioning it. My ex husband isn't believing a word they say (so he tells me) and they are refusing to buy the DNA test. \n\nI was going to leave it at that but now I have this very...well it's a petty idea. The plan is to get the DNA test and when the results come back I am going to print it out, get a very nice frame for them and send it for their way as a Christmas gift. I even thought about including a card that says \"congrats on being grandparents\". \n\nNow I know this is an asshole move...but like so much I shouldn't do or just petty enough that it's perfect?\n\n***Update to answer some questions\n\nFirst off...wow. I actually didn't expect to get this many comments. There were a few things in the comments so I am going to clear up a few thing:\n\n1. My ex does know about my idea because I told him straight up I was thinking of doing it. He laughed but then realized he would be the one delivering it or atleast get the backlash from it because I have no contact with them what so ever. He told me to do what I want and he already has a rocky relationship with them. He is mad they are denying his daughter.\n\n2. This gift would not be opened in front of any of the kids. I doubt they would even hang it up so I'm sure the kids wouldn't see it. Imo the damage has already been done by them denying her for no reason. As she gets older I have no intention on telling her about this. \n\n3. I have no intention of having any kind of relationship with them. This isn't the first time things have been said/done and I've chosen to keep my mouth shut about all of it. When I first met ex MIL the first words she said was something along the lines of \"So this is the bitch whose dating my son\". \n\n4. I have been reading all the comments and taking everyone opinion into consideration.", "created_utc": 1670442794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfbosv/wibta_if_i_gave_my_ex_in_laws_a_spiteful_gift/", "score": 618, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can get the test, but it really only matters if you are interested in your ancestry or if your ex feels it is necessary. Since he doesn\u2019t seem to think that way, it is more about making you feel better. What for? The in laws suck. You don\u2019t need to deal with them.

Just being deliciously petty to people who DESERVE to be slapped upside the head with a DNA test.", "NTA, but depending on defamation laws where you live and how widely they're saying it, I'd be inclined to send it as an attachment to a notice of a defamation suit.", "NTA, I love this idea. Could you please let us know, through your ex, what their reaction was?", "NTA but I hope none of you will let your children near them again.", "Get the dna and send the proof.

It's not just harmful to you to be accused of being a cheater, as that could be so harmful to your kids if they hear grandma and grandpa say they aren't their \"actual\" grandkids.  This Christmas, put them in their place.", "Cherish the thought of doing this but then DON'T.  Spite is unbecoming...", "Just because of honesty, yeah it would be an ESH.\n\nThe intent is to be petty which is asshole behavior no matter how justified it is.", "YWBTA. Dont do it. Dont lower yourself to low people. Be better.\n\nGet the DNA test done and then your ex can deal with his parents. LET IT GO.", "Yes agreed that", "Not sure if it's worth it unless it shuts them up. But they are idiots. They'll say she photoshopped it.", "It's a little bit a fear I have... My partner is mix and I'm white...

Tell your ex to do it too(if you are on good enough terms).\n\nOffer a framed copy of the two kids results and put copies/originals for each kid in their baby books(or where you keep birth certificates and the like).

That way the kids don't have to be subjected to the harm of their grandparents accusations.  \n\nBUT the grandparents will know that you, OP, are rubbing their nose in their accusations.", "Ohhhh boy. I hate these people who base everything off half-remembered textbooks from when they were like eleven.\n\nSurprise surprise, human appearances in the real world don\u2019t map 1:1 with a Punnett square.", "They were the ones that asked for trouble.

The only features you can clearly identify that came from my dad are my height and eye color. And my eye color didn't even start that way.

Our parents can all go jump off a cliff though.", "Yeah I look like a combo of my mother, father, and step-dad. People have had some interesting things to say over the years.", "Hahaha opposites. Also half Asian and half white and being short apparently gives the Asian away", "Maybe not, but something needs to be done to protect the poor kid from these bullies.\n\nAlso, frankly, there are some people you just can't take the high road with.
