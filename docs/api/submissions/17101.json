I asked her to get me 3 tickets cause she could buy three left with her presale code. One of my friend who was gonna go with me cant make it and I asked the friend if she knew anyone who would want the ticket. She said no so I said i will go ahead and just sell it. So I\u2019m inbetween splitting the money with this friend who help me get the ticket, not the person who couldn\u2019t make it.

Judgement call. If you ponied up the money, I would normally say you keep the money, but if you couldn't get the tickets in the first place without your friend, I definitely think she's owed something. \n\nIf you're just going with cash, I think she deserves a finder's fee, whatever you think that should be. 20% or 30% maybe. Or you could go the gift route. Get her something really nice and thoughtful that you know she'd like, assuming you don't think she would be hung up on actual cash. \n\nIn any case, how much or what you give her is a judgement call, but you WBTAH if you didn't give her anything IMO.", "YTA - As a fellow Swiftie, that\u2019s lame as hell you had someone pay more when you know how hard these tickets are to get and how much they cost.\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself\n\nAnd the fact you want to rip your friend off who gave you the code to get them to make said profit!!??

Problem number two. \n\nTaylor Swift tickets were such a fiasco for this tour, and you\u2019re contributing to the problem. I\u2019ve always had great seats for her concerts in the past.
