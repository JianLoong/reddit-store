I adopted a dog out -- was the wrong home for her entirely but we did bond while she was here- and the last time i visited her she cried at the door. So I dont visit anymore, even though Im invited to. I kept up with her for a year or so, transferred the microchip, and sort of tried to let her go. I would still like to know when she dies because I do love her but it kind of hurts in a way to even talk about her. You feel like you abandoned her and in your brothers case he did. He did he chose his girlfriend over his dog and Im sure there is an element of guilt to that that may be the reason his communication about the dog dropped off. In my case, lil was a dog who did not get along with others and was basically not getting what she needed here as a result and i still feel guilty.

But as time goes on you miss them so much that you just want them back and you know that you can\u2019t - in most cases because their new owner won\u2019t give them back, they have grown attached and sometimes other factors are involved such as your circumstances.\n\nSo me reaching out to ask after the pet became horrible and awkward for everyone and painful for me. I cried after every phone call. I decided it was in everyone\u2019s interest if I stopped. I always asked common associates how the pet was doing, and sobbed my heart out when they died as my secret stupid dream of being reunited was squashed.\n\nYou never stop loving a pet, and a chance to say goodbye in their final days would mean everything.

Nubby is better with other cats, so when my cousin died he took his cat, which made me feel better because I knew she\u2019d be safe and loved. My ex and I are now in different states and barely talk unless it\u2019s about the cats, and when we do it\u2019s very rare. If we were out of touch for an extended time and he didn\u2019t tell me or I didn\u2019t tell him about one of them dying each of us would be livid with the other.

You weren\u2019t obligated to tell him, but it would\u2019ve been the thoughtful thing to do. When I was 10 my cat had kittens. We kept two and gave one to a friend of mine.

I dont think you had any responsibility to tell him though", "It sounds to me like he lives pretty far away and he and OP aren\u2019t seeing each other in general or close. Which probably makes your comment about \u201cif you actually care, you would see them\u201d a bit harsh. Plus if the pet is given to a shelter that\u2019s not an option, so your comment is a little uncaring towards people in that situation.\n\nEveryone copes differently, and as I say, I found it too hard to speak about my pet and found it better to try and forget about it. I once sobbed about it in a therapy session that I thought was going to be about an assault I went through, I was so distraught for years over losing my pet. It is great that you find comfort in seeing your pet regularly and maybe OPs brother would have coped the same if he was seeing the dog every week, and the pain of missing it wasn\u2019t as bad. But the distance and infrequent contact that was purely about the dog, probably became too upsetting.\n\nEdit to add: It might be different if OP and their brother were close in general and talking about other things in the calls, but it\u2019s obvious that the calls were just about the dog, and that\u2019s what I mean when I say it probably became too upsetting.", "Depends on the dog and people involved. Sometimes seeing the dog every week can prevent them from bonding with their new people and relaxing in their new home. It can also be annoying to the new owners who may feel that the dog isn\u2019t truly theirs due to having to constantly factor in the previous owners feelings.", "This situation isn't about a shelter, so my comment in this case, isn't uncaring. It's also brothers' fault for leaving him. You assume a lot for someone who doesn't know the brother. I stay with facts. First, he contacted for 2 years, then he stopped. He gave up on the dog & if he wanted to know if it would die, he should have communicated that. Other person can't read your mind.", "Oh gosh, NTA, but I texted my ex 5 years after we broke up, with no communication in between, to tell him the dog we rescued together died. It\u2019s not unreasonable for him to think you\u2019d let him know since he had him for so long. That he wanted updates for two years after giving him up means he probably had a real attachment to the dog. It would have been nice of you to let him know, but you were in no way obligated to.", "It would have been kind to let him know. I\u2019m sure this is a nuanced situation. You judge your brother for having given up the dog he was meant to be a responsible guardian for. He made sure the dog had a good home, so he at least rehomed the dog responsibly. He moved on from thinking of the dog as his. You and your brother seem not to be as close or communicative as you once were. \n\nNonetheless I think not telling him was punitive. He was going to find out sooner or later, and that news would have been better coming from you. \n\nMay I suggest that he probably felt some degree of guilt over rehoming the dog, and that over time it was easier to let it go outwardly. I imagine his feelings about that whole difficult decision weigh on him more than you might think. It can\u2019t have been an easy choice. You don\u2019t say what age he was when he made that decision. If he was pretty young, I can imagine a decision someone made, say, in their twenties coming back to bite them\u2026 \n\nNot going to call either of you an arsehole.

I still want to know.\" OP's brother did not even take that minimal step.
