He gradually contacted me less and less though. Two years after giving me the dog, he stopped asking and I stopped sending updates. We\u2019d only call each other on birthdays and the holidays.\n\nChuck lived with me for nine years before he died. I didn\u2019t tell my brother. He didn\u2019t know until our dad called him.

Yeah, you probably should have given him the courtesy of a phone call, but he also failed to exhibit any interest in the dog.  I don't think he's really angry at you.  I think he feels guilty for ignoring the dog, and he's lashing out at you because you're an easier target than honest self-reflection.", "NTA if he stopped asking about that dog two years later and that dog lived with you for nine, then he never once asked about that dog in SEVEN years.", "NTA. He gave up his dog for a woman. He stopped asking well before. He didn\u2019t think to ask after _fourteen years_ \u201cHow\u2019s old Chuckie-boy doing, bro?\u201d He didn\u2019t love that dog.", "NTA - It would have been nice to tell your brother, but I see no obligation. Especially if brother hasn't been asking about him in years.", "He chose wrong. You always choose the dog.", "NAH here. If he\u2019d stopped asking entirely, you\u2019re totally not at fault for not thinking to contact him. I also get why he was probably upset, but he gave up any sort of entitlement when he gave up Chuck. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA you don't update any thing about chuck after two years and your brother never ask about dog before. I don't think you do anything wrong if I were you I will think he don't want any update anymore.", "I'm actually really on the fence with this one", "Nta he doesn\u2019t get to abandon the dog and then still slap your hand. I don\u2019t blame him for rehoming the dog because it sounds like it worked out but he doesn\u2019t get to be rude", "NTA but Sometimes its really hard to keep tabs on dogs you love but have had to give up for some reason. I adopted a dog out -- was the wrong home for her entirely but we did bond while she was here- and the last time i visited her she cried at the door. So I dont visit anymore, even though Im invited to. I kept up with her for a year or so, transferred the microchip, and sort of tried to let her go. I would still like to know when she dies because I do love her but it kind of hurts in a way to even talk about her. You feel like you abandoned her and in your brothers case he did. He did he chose his girlfriend over his dog and Im sure there is an element of guilt to that that may be the reason his communication about the dog dropped off. In my case, lil was a dog who did not get along with others and was basically not getting what she needed here as a result and i still feel guilty. And I can tell the adopter doesnt think I loved her\n\nso...i mean girlfriend not worth it though hope your brother trades up. who loves someone and then deprives them of their beloved pet? A \\*\\*\\*\\*", "NTA, and how people are calling you an asshole is beyond me. He abandoned his dog. If he cared about the dog so much then he shouldn\u2019t have given it up", "NTA, but your brother and his gf (now wife) are. If she hates dogs, she should never have started dating someone with a dog. Since she did, she also had the option of seeing if he would agree to not getting another dog when the inevitable happens. She should *never* have demanded he choose. He shouldn't have agreed to give the dog up. When you adopt an animal, you are committing to that pet for their life. There are circumstances where the right thing is to rehome an animal. This is absolutely not one of them. Why should you tell him when the dog he gave up, apparently with little to no regrets, passed away?", "NTA he literally chose his new girlfriend over chuck. I hope chuck has a wonderful life with you", "NTA - seems like he forgot about Chuck. He eventually found out and that is how it goes.", "Decent thing would have been to tell him, but your brother gave up his rights when he gave up Chuck.  NTA", "I feel like ops brother's girl is an asshole.\nOp would have been extremely nice to inform him, about the dogs health.  Op shouldn't have to, ops brother gave up the dog and shouldn't expect it.", "NTA - If your brother loved Chuck so much, he wouldn't have thrown him out like last weeks trash.", "Nta - he forgot about Chuck over a piece of p*ssy - Chuck couldn't have been that important to him xx", "The death of a pet is a weird as thing to gatekeep and petty as hell.\n\nYTA", "NTA he gave up a best bud who\u2019s innocent for a woman. He had that dog for five years and tossed em away for a woman. Chuck was a baby. He stopped asking or calling or checking up on the dog. That\u2019s his fault. That wasn\u2019t his dog anymore. Chuck is now his brothers dog not his.", "NTA.\n\nPeople talking about how they were forced to give up their dogs are really missing the point here. I\u2019m sorry for the terrible things that happened to you, but OP\u2019s brother was given a choice. He chose to give up his dog instead of dumping that woman, and he only asked for updates for two years. Op had the dog for nine, so that\u2019s seven years of the brother not inquiring after the dog.", "NTA he was your dog for 9 years and for the last 7 years your brother wasn't involved with Chuck at all. \n\nIt might have been a kind thing for you to let him know when it happened since he was your brothers dog at one point, but I don't think that rises to the level of AH for not telling him.", "soft YTA, as we get older people don\u2019t keep in contact anywhere near as often. unless he treated the dog poorly, i think it still would\u2019ve been nice for him to know.", "I mean yeah you are his brother why wouldn\u2019t you tell him? YTA", "I called my ex husband every time one of the dogs we had together was extremely ill and when they passed away. We separated over 8 years ago. The last girl passed away May 1st of this year. She was over 16 years old... You bet your ass I sent him her last photos and a copy of her paw print. \n\nYTA... U should have told him... No matter what.", "YTA. My spouse had to give up a pet dog he had for years as his circumstances changed, and he could no longer provide a good life for the dog. He gave it to a rescue. The rescue centre's director ended up adopting the dog herself. Even she reached out to him when the dog was on his last leg. She allowed my spouse to go throw the ball to him one last time before the dog died. \n\nTime apart doesn't change love for animals. You should have told him.", "ESH - why don\u2019t you and your brother talk?", "YTA. \n\nI have given up an animal before, it was forced and I was under 18. I tried keeping in touch with the new owner but it honestly became too painful for everyone. At first that contact is comforting because you just want to know the pet is ok. But as time goes on you miss them so much that you just want them back and you know that you can\u2019t - in most cases because their new owner won\u2019t give them back, they have grown attached and sometimes other factors are involved such as your circumstances.\n\nSo me reaching out to ask after the pet became horrible and awkward for everyone and painful for me. I cried after every phone call. I decided it was in everyone\u2019s interest if I stopped. I always asked common associates how the pet was doing, and sobbed my heart out when they died as my secret stupid dream of being reunited was squashed.\n\nYou never stop loving a pet, and a chance to say goodbye in their final days would mean everything. You could have been a kind person and offered that, or given him closure afterwards. You think that because he stopped asking, he stopped caring, and in my experience that is just not true.", "YTA, should've told him man especially if he \"raised\" him", "Yeah, you should have. I know I would have wanted to know.", "It would have been such a small effort for you to just tell him. Instead you actively chose not to. You don't seem to like your brother because this would've been the human and decent thing to do. You liking him doesn't matter here and YTA.", "ESH, of course you should have told him it's common courtesy. But also he's the asshole for staying with someone who gave him such an ugly ultimatum. No orgasm in the world is worth abandoning a dog. \n\n\nI'm extremely distrustful of people who don't like dogs. You mean you don't like the one creature that has an imbedded amity to humans, can reflect your very soul to you and read your entire character with a sniff? Suss.", "YTA should\u2019ve told him. Even if he stopped asking for updates that\u2019s major enough to just tell him.", "YTA. My ex has my other can and my cousins cat. We broke up and it wasn\u2019t fair no matter what happened but Mae cat followed me around and Nubby slept with him every night, they never bonded so although we each love them we split them based on the human they were most attached to. Nubby is better with other cats, so when my cousin died he took his cat, which made me feel better because I knew she\u2019d be safe and loved. My ex and I are now in different states and barely talk unless it\u2019s about the cats, and when we do it\u2019s very rare. If we were out of touch for an extended time and he didn\u2019t tell me or I didn\u2019t tell him about one of them dying each of us would be livid with the other. Just because you were out of touch doesn\u2019t mean that dog wasn\u2019t loved.", "honestly yeah YTA", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He ditched his baby for a woman, and letting him know he\u2019d passed would\u2019ve been the decent thing to do.", "NTA, it\u2019s like calling the rescue you got him from for an update.  You just don\u2019t update unless asked. \n\nWe got a dog from my brother in law because his job kept him away and still does and my son loved this dog.  But when we go out of town he watches him, when he sees a dog toy he gets it for him. He may need surgery soon and the bother offered to split it.  See my brother in law would be told because he still participate in the dogs life.  But no way would Think to call if he wasn\u2019t part of the dogs life.  Just not something I would share.", "It sounds like the dog wasn\u2019t the only one left behind.

He made a hard choice, saw the dog was in good hands, and let go. That doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t love the dog and was sad to learn he\u2019s died. You weren\u2019t obligated to tell him, but it would\u2019ve been the thoughtful thing to do. When I was 10 my cat had kittens. We kept two and gave one to a friend of mine. The two we kept and their mom all met unfortunate ends (my mom insisted on the cars being inside/outside, to my objections) and I didn\u2019t really talk to that friend after we moved. To my surprise she reached out on Facebook when we were in our late 20s to let me know that hers had died. It hit me surprisingly hard, even though I hadn\u2019t thought about that cat in years. She didn\u2019t need to reach out to me, I had even less claim to that then your brother, but I really appreciated that she did.", "NTA\n\nYou don't rehome a pet you love because someone new came around and doesn't like the pet. I would have chosen the dog. To me, pets are a lifelong commitment.\n\nIf he really loved the dog, he would have put more effort in.", "Damn right. OP\u2019s brother stopped truly caring the moment he chose that woman over the poor dog.", "OP, I understand your comment, but what's wrong with just being a loving brother and letting him know the dog died? Must everything be a petty argument. I doubt this is how your parents raised you. His wife might have been allergic to dogs, where they live they may not have been allowed to have dogs; whatever the reason  shouldn't kindness prevail.", "This is it.", "Agreed.", "everyone sucks here", "He is married to her now. He didn\u2019t trade her.", "I mean, chuck is dead so that ship has sailed lol", "I mean, he didn\u2019t throw the dog out, he found chuck a loving home with someone he trusts. A true AH would\u2019ve let the dog become a stray or dropped him off at an already over-populated pound", "His brother never asked about the dog - whatever - he found out in an appropriate way for how he cared about the dog", "Chuck stopped being the brother\u2019s pet the moment the brother gave him up for a woman.", "I had to rehome a dog once because she was honestly too much for me (single parent with a small child and a very large, high energy dog) to handle. I kept in contact with the family who took her in for a while. After some time passed, I stopped because it honestly felt like a burden to them to keep asking for those updates.\n\nIf OP and his brother talk routinely then that\u2019s a different thing because you can ask causally during the conversation. If they\u2019re not talking routinely then that\u2019s on both of them.", "Your situation and OP\u2019s brother are polar opposites though. You and your ex put up with each other for the sake of the dogs even after divorce. OP\u2019s brother, on the other hand, tossed aside the dog for his wife.", "Yeah but the only circumstances that changed was the brothers relationship status. You don't get rid of a pet you've had for five years because your girlfriend doesn't like dogs. \n\nBrother made his choice to get rid of the dog, made the choice to stop asking for updates, made the choice to never visit. He abandoned the dog and is not entitled to updates.", "I had to give up my dog too, but I still see him every week. It's not OPs fault. If you actually cared for a dog, you would see him/her. So nta for OP. Also, I told my mom straight away that if he dies or is about to die, let me know. It's my job to communicate as I left him.", "I don't think OP was trying to spite his brother, he probably genuinely thought he would not care. With good reason.", "That\u2019s what I was starting to think and then I found this! \n\nYep. ESH", "ew. I dont think you had any responsibility to tell him though", "It sounds to me like he lives pretty far away and he and OP aren\u2019t seeing each other in general or close. Which probably makes your comment about \u201cif you actually care, you would see them\u201d a bit harsh. Plus if the pet is given to a shelter that\u2019s not an option, so your comment is a little uncaring towards people in that situation.\n\nEveryone copes differently, and as I say, I found it too hard to speak about my pet and found it better to try and forget about it. I once sobbed about it in a therapy session that I thought was going to be about an assault I went through, I was so distraught for years over losing my pet. It is great that you find comfort in seeing your pet regularly and maybe OPs brother would have coped the same if he was seeing the dog every week, and the pain of missing it wasn\u2019t as bad. But the distance and infrequent contact that was purely about the dog, probably became too upsetting.\n\nEdit to add: It might be different if OP and their brother were close in general and talking about other things in the calls, but it\u2019s obvious that the calls were just about the dog, and that\u2019s what I mean when I say it probably became too upsetting.", "Depends on the dog and people involved. Sometimes seeing the dog every week can prevent them from bonding with their new people and relaxing in their new home. It can also be annoying to the new owners who may feel that the dog isn\u2019t truly theirs due to having to constantly factor in the previous owners feelings.", "This situation isn't about a shelter, so my comment in this case, isn't uncaring. It's also brothers' fault for leaving him. You assume a lot for someone who doesn't know the brother. I stay with facts. First, he contacted for 2 years, then he stopped. He gave up on the dog & if he wanted to know if it would die, he should have communicated that. Other person can't read your mind."]}
