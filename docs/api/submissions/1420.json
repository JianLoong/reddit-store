I (16F) was talking to my friend (17F) let\u2019s call her V, during our second class period like normal. She then mentioned that she met someone at her church that she likes. Let\u2019s call him A. V told me that he\u2019s cute and he\u2019s a worship leader, and he sings really well. She then showed me her texts which basically just showed him asking her to show up to Bible study with him (it sounds odd but it really is the Christian way of flirting). I thought it was cute and encouraged her to go. She then told me his age. A is 22. V is 17. That is a 5 year age gap, and where I live it\u2019s not acceptable. I told her this was weird and she said it really wasn\u2019t and that in her culture it is acceptable (Belarusian). I told her that even in my culture things that are acceptable aren\u2019t okay morally, like how my elders will encourage you to eat more but fat shame you if you gain any extra weight (Chinese). She said that it was just different and we left the conversation at that.\n\nToday, she came into class and was talking about how her cousin (13) posted a Tiktok and a guy (18) from her church commented something about no nut November on her post, and how disgusting that age gap is. I told her it\u2019s the same age gap as her and that 22 year old, but she just kept saying that it was different. I told her it\u2019s just as creepy. I also told her if she were 18 I\u2019d be more okay with it, because that\u2019s the age of consent where I live (even though I\u2019d still find it a bit weird). I\u2019m very worried that A will take advantage of V and that the church will even influence them to get together. I\u2019m very scared that she\u2019s going to end up hurt somehow, and I can\u2019t seem to get that point across to her, that it\u2019s not okay. Now things are a bit awkward between us and I\u2019m not quite sure I took the right approach.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667607172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymeud5/aita_for_telling_my_friend_the_age_gap_between/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
