And they must serve you a 30 day notice to quit. My guess is you ignored that so the landlord had to take you to court which then would make sense as to the 10 days.\n\nNew Hampshire has a special process for eviction. No landlord can lawfully evict a tenant without following the steps set out by state law (RSA 540). A tenant can be evicted for violating the lease. If the tenant has no written lease, she or he can be evicted for a variety of reasons. In New Hampshire, tenants renting part of a privately owned and owner-occupied home can be evicted for almost any reason.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to the State of New Hampshire, there are five \"good\" causes for eviction:\r  \n\r  \nFailure to pay the rent;\r  \nSubstantial damage to the premises;\r  \nBehavior that affects the health and safety of others;\r  \nViolation of the lease;\r  \nOther good cause.\r  \n\"Other good cause\" may include legitimate business reasons of the landlord. If, however, the \"other\" cause is something that the tenant did or did not do, then the landlord must first give the tenant a written warning that in the future the action or inaction will be grounds for eviction.\r  \n\r  \nThe tenant can reverse the order for eviction in the first three causes by \"remedying\" the situation, that is, paying the rent, repairing the damage, and so forth.\r  \n\r  \nA landlord can legally evict a tenant only by sending a written notice to the tenant. This written notice must be in the form of a \"written notice to quit or leave\" which is a legal document. Eviction for not paying rent, damages to the property or danger to the health or safety of others require seven days' notice. All other grounds for eviction require 30 days' notice.", "NTA!

A true friend or loved one would ask, What can I do to help? Rather than just vomiting useless info at you. She could take the kids off your hands during the day so you can pack in peace. Or she could bring you a meal, so you don't have to worry about it. Or she could offer room in her house to stay or to just store some of your stuff. She could also just help by taping new boxes so you can fill them, tape filled boxes closed, label things for you or even help arrange boxes so necessities get taken first. There are a billion ways to help and she managed to miss all of them. I have moved many times, so I have the system down. Whenever a friend has to move I offer my services, but never push.
