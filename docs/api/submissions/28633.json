These judgment beliefs include the idea that bisexuals are in transition to a gay or lesbian identity, are in denial about their true sexuality, lack courage to come out as gay or lesbian, are confused or undecided about their sexual orientation, or that bisexuals refuse to come out as lesbian/gay to maintain heterosexual privilege. Believing that bisexual individuals have access to heterosexual privilege, particularly when they have other-sex partners, is also a stereotype that many in gay and lesbian communities ascribe to bisexual individuals. This includes the belief that a bisexual-identi\ufb01ed individual will leave his or her same-sex partner for the social bene\ufb01ts and privileges of a heterosexual relationship. ...

In most families, for example, members are presumed to be heterosexual; conversely, at a women\u2019s bar all the women present are presumed lesbians. When a bisexual person does speak up in an attempt to avoid being mislabeled, this act is often seen as stridency, a flaunting of her orientation, or even interpreted as hostility, an experience shared by lesbians and gay men when they speak up in heterosexual contexts.*  \n>  \n>*Blasingame suggests that we consider why we are fighting each other and not the system. The danger of this act of blaming is that it shifts the focus of our anger from the oppressor to the target group member who is perceived to be less oppressed.

This happens to Activists in a \"can't see the forest for the trees\" sort of way. People with nontraditional/nonconforming sexualities aren't a monolith, but what tends to happen is for activism purposes they tend to try to push a wide spectrum of only very loosely connected identities into a small set of very rigid labels and rigid language losing sight of why these people needed to be fought for in the first place.

Also, it's the only one that matters because that's what OP is having the argument with their friend over", "But but... bisexuality isn't reaaal. :( Bisexuals have it easier because they're technically half straight! /s", "Yes, I understand that. But those people always existed. Everybody finding a new box into which they can fit themselves with a label is tiresome.\n\nDownvote away.", "I haven't experienced any biphobia to be honest simply cause I never had the want to include myself into the LGBTQ community but I read about similar things that you pointed out.\n\nWhat made me realise I do not want to deal with them though were two friends that started to include themselves more and more who became utterly insufferable assholes over time. One already knew he was trans when we became friends, the other was a bisexual man who later came out as trans aswell. Two really decent people who drastically changed over time, who started to pick on every word that didn't suit them, who took slight at every joke they would have made before aswell.\n\nSo for me it is not about being excluded from anyone just that I met too many people associated with that community, along with my former friends who I simply don't like as people. Not cause of their sexuality or gender, they just had a nasty personality. So I don't see the need to be an ally or care about a community of people I had overwhelmingly negative interactions with. \n\nAlso as you said. To be bi, straight, trans, gay or whatever else is just how things are. To me it doesn't matter what someones sexuality is but if that person is a dick then I won't like them. Simple as that.", "It's not the LGBTQ+, but the longer ones. In conversations, I usually don't use LGBTQ+ because it takes a while to say, but in writing, I do usually use it. My friend said something about a lot of specific names for different kinds of trans people, like gender fluid, of course, but if I remember correctly, there were a lot.", "It's not the 5 letters that OP is talking about, but the various extended versions that keep changing. The last one I remember is LGBTQIA but I'm sure that's way out of date. It is a mouthful tho.", "It is true though. They aren\u2019t saying they don\u2019t want to remember the \u201cLGBTQ+\u201d acronym. They are saying they don\u2019t want to remember every letter/number after the \u201c+\u201d of which there are LOADS of variants.\n\nLGBTQIA+ and LGBTQIA2S+ actually more \u201cup to date\u201d than LGBTQ+ for a start in regards to media. Then there are other forms that some people in the community use for example LGBTQQIAAPPK is specifically used in a page by a company that provides LGBTQ+ cruises to show their inclusivity alongside an explanation on why they usually only use LGBT+ when referring to their clients rather than the \u201cfull\u201d acronym that they refer to in that one page.", "I remember not seeing this friend for a year or so, and when we met up, he started talking about how another friend came out as bi. She had a girlfriend and was going to Pride, and he started adding stuff like, \"it's really cool of her to come out\" and \"she's amazing for doing what she wants,\" and weird stuff like that.\n\nI awkwardly reminded him, \"you know I'm also bi, right..?\"   \nAnd he was like, *\"forreal?!\"*  \n\"Yeah. You don't remember?\"  \n\\> *\"No... no, I do... I just thought maybe you grew out of it or something.\"*  \n\"It's not something you grow out of... I just don't go around reminding everyone.\"  \n\\> *\"But like... have you ever done anything with a woman?\"*  \n\"... yes.\"  \n\\> *\"Like... sex?\"*  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\\> *\"In a car or something?\"*  \n\"What? No?\"  \n\\> *\"But how did you have sex, though?\"*\n\nLike, what the fuck?! \n\n**When you're bisexual, you're apparently:**  \n\\> a mainstream fantasy pornstar  \n\\> confused  \n\\> going through a phase  \n\\> faking it for attention  \n\\> secretly gay\n\nThese are claims made by both straight people and those who are a part of the LGBTQ+ community. \n\nGenuinely, why the Hell would OP have internalized homo-/biphobia for not actively wanting to take part in a community that respects her sexuality as much as straight people do? What value does the acronym have for us if our representation is worth a single letter to them. They judge us for not fighting *for* them when they are fighting against us.\n\nI've learned that many bisexual people do not desire to associate with Pride or the LGBTQ+. There is apparently a mutual disinterest in one another, and yet one side still tries to force itself upon the other.", "It might be \"tiresome\" to you, but to me? I was 27 years old, and neck deep in a marriage where I was being coercively raped constantly because I didn't have sexual attraction before I realized \"those people always existed\". I didn't know it was a thing humans could be. I thought I was physically deformed. I was ready to start looking for surgery to \"correct\" my \"obvious fault\". \n\nFinding out that asexuality was real changed everything for me and freed me from that life. I needed to find that box, because without it, I was just some broken waste of time. I NEEDED that label. \n\nBeing able to identify yourself and find a community matters.", "That makes sense, I've changed my vote and main comment", "If that's the case, then my vote is different", "Okay. I'm glad you found a community. And I'm sorry that you felt compelled to marry when you didn't feel any attraction towards that person."]}
