{"id": 2417, "submission_id": "yw7y3e", "title": "AITA for telling my wife that since she is home full time, she should be doing more?", "selftext": "My wife lost the drive she had to work when COVID hit. Kids came home full time and she had to stop work but just never went back to work when they went back to school, outside of collectively 4 months. Her and I worked together at one point at an incredibly well paying job but as soon as she got in to a position of power and people started giving her a hard time, she cracked and couldn't do it anymore. She quit the next day. People there really were pieces of absolute shit and I defended her when I could but she couldn't stick it out. She was making $28 an hour. It was a great loss with her quitting. Since then she has sat home and plays games that generate money on her phone. She has like 8 apps that generate money but it's not much. So she sits home, all day. Doing essentially nothing outside of cooking meals. She cleans thoroughly maybe once a week so I always come home from work to a semi-dirty house in-between the kids and the animals. \n\nI'm honestly becoming fed up due to the house looking the way that it does. At this point I'm starting to think she just lounges around all day. I've talked to her about getting a job and she will apply for places but if she doesn't get a call back or if they give the position to someone else, she immediately becomes discouraged and stops trying again. She gets child support for one of her kids (whom I consider mine but are not biologically) but both her children's father's are dead beats and do not take the kids at all and while she is pushing to go through the courts, that hasn't been much of anything either (that is not her fault- she is trying there). I absolutely know for certain that she is depressed but I'm starting to lose myself mentally because of the house clutter and being the sole provider. Of course I want her to get help but at this point I'm more concerned with the fact that I'm constantly broke. Sure, she absolutely makes up for it in other departments and she treats me incredibly well but I'm just frustrated.\n\nSo yesterday I was feeling off and didn't feel like speaking at all. She asked me what was wrong and I said nothing. That I was fine. Later on I caved and mentioned the job thing again and she asked if that was what was bothering me. I told her it was, mixed with the house looking the way it does. It's not even dirty dirty. Just unswept floors and dishes that always seem to pile up no matter how much they get washed. She asked if I understood how much she does during the day for upkeep and I was honest and said no. Doesn't look like she does anything at all and that it would be nice if she was doing more. She starts crying. Says I make her feel like an absolute burden and that she's tired of trying when it's not like I notice anyways. She then shows me pictures of the house absolutely trashed and says \"This is what I fucking deal with every single day while you're gone because of your unruly dog.\" She then pulls up indeed. 181 applications sent out in the past 2 months.

Would you advise your friend to push spouse back into a hostile work environment where she was set up to fail and sabotaged every step of the way?  Would you tell your friend, wow, YTA, which is what I'm telling you?  Because YTA.\n\nStraight talk: you need marriage counseling and you need it now.  It's reasonable for you to be tired and frustrated, but the way that you let her know that you're tired and frustrated was shitty as hell.  Now both of you are on the road to resentment, which leads to contempt, and that's what kills relationships.\n\nAs for the house clutter, are you physically disabled to the point where you are unable to pick up a broom and sweep the floors?  Are you unable to wash the dishes you see in the sink when you get home?  Are you unable to teach your children that it's after dinner and now we're all going to clean the kitchen?  If the answer to these questions is \"no,\" then you have an immediate way to fix what's irritating you: you put your bag down, change from your work clothes, and sweep the floors.  Stop making YOUR frustration at unswept floors into HER problem and do something about it.  I promise you that doing your share of day-to-day household work--not just the once a week you do laundry, but the daily grind--will go waaaaaaaay further than words at getting your wife to trust you when you say you want things to get better.\n\nFinally, how old are the children?  Are they old enough that they can get to/from school on their own and can reasonably take care of themselves between end of the school day and whenever your or your wife get home?  Are they old enough that they can take a place in the household chore rotation?  If not, then you need to really, truly get it into your head how much this limits your wife's ability to find a job outside the home.  If the cost of child care is more than her wage-earning potential is worth, that's a big limitation.  If she has to be available at 4pm to pick the kids up, that's a big limitation.  If you never thought about this before, like you never thought about how much household work she was doing, then I strongly recommend that you sit down and honestly discuss this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO ADD: OP in another comment you say that you got the dog during CVD lockdowns when your wife was already homeschooling the kids and didn't have time to train a dog, you know the dog is a problem, your wife has told you the dog is a problem so often without you doing anything that she's no longer bothering to tell you how much of a problem the dog is.  Again, if you want to get your wife to trust you when you say things will get better, then you need to stop making YOUR dog into HER problem and start training the dog.\n\nEDIT 2: You say the OLDEST child is 12.  That means that the younger ones are grade-school age and absolutely cannot be left at home unsupervised.  So...who cares for the kids after school?  Who picks them up/drops them off, if you're not in a place with school buses?  I guarantee you that this is a huge reason your wife is having trouble finding a job....she HAS a full time job, it's care work, and the kind of part-time jobs she's looking for want a full-time commitment.  \n\nOP, please, please, please get marriage counseling and take some initiative with household management if you want to stay married.", "You both need counseling. That isn't healthy behavior on her part and it really sounds like there's some lack of communication between you and possibly unrealistic expectations on your part where the housekeeping is concerned. How were you to know she'd sent out 181 applications if you weren't discussing it? How do you get a realistic idea of what it's like fighting the cleaning chaos of just even trying to maintain a full house?\n\nYour high energy dog needs training, exercise and mental stimulation. Are the kids walking the dog? It needs more than just out in the yard. It needs to get out and sniff and explore which engages the brain and helps tire it out. Some puzzle toys would help, too.
