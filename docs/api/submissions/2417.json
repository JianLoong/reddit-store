Kids came home full time and she had to stop work but just never went back to work when they went back to school, outside of collectively 4 months. Her and I worked together at one point at an incredibly well paying job but as soon as she got in to a position of power and people started giving her a hard time, she cracked and couldn't do it anymore. She quit the next day. People there really were pieces of absolute shit and I defended her when I could but she couldn't stick it out. She was making $28 an hour. It was a great loss with her quitting. Since then she has sat home and plays games that generate money on her phone. She has like 8 apps that generate money but it's not much. So she sits home, all day. Doing essentially nothing outside of cooking meals. She cleans thoroughly maybe once a week so I always come home from work to a semi-dirty house in-between the kids and the animals. \n\nI'm honestly becoming fed up due to the house looking the way that it does. At this point I'm starting to think she just lounges around all day. I've talked to her about getting a job and she will apply for places but if she doesn't get a call back or if they give the position to someone else, she immediately becomes discouraged and stops trying again. She gets child support for one of her kids (whom I consider mine but are not biologically) but both her children's father's are dead beats and do not take the kids at all and while she is pushing to go through the courts, that hasn't been much of anything either (that is not her fault- she is trying there). I absolutely know for certain that she is depressed but I'm starting to lose myself mentally because of the house clutter and being the sole provider. Of course I want her to get help but at this point I'm more concerned with the fact that I'm constantly broke. Sure, she absolutely makes up for it in other departments and she treats me incredibly well but I'm just frustrated.\n\nSo yesterday I was feeling off and didn't feel like speaking at all. She asked me what was wrong and I said nothing. That I was fine. Later on I caved and mentioned the job thing again and she asked if that was what was bothering me. I told her it was, mixed with the house looking the way it does. It's not even dirty dirty. Just unswept floors and dishes that always seem to pile up no matter how much they get washed. She asked if I understood how much she does during the day for upkeep and I was honest and said no. Doesn't look like she does anything at all and that it would be nice if she was doing more. She starts crying. Says I make her feel like an absolute burden and that she's tired of trying when it's not like I notice anyways. She then shows me pictures of the house absolutely trashed and says \"This is what I fucking deal with every single day while you're gone because of your unruly dog.\" She then pulls up indeed. 181 applications sent out in the past 2 months.

Would you tell your friend, wow, YTA, which is what I'm telling you?  Because YTA.\n\nStraight talk: you need marriage counseling and you need it now.  It's reasonable for you to be tired and frustrated, but the way that you let her know that you're tired and frustrated was shitty as hell.  Now both of you are on the road to resentment, which leads to contempt, and that's what kills relationships.\n\nAs for the house clutter, are you physically disabled to the point where you are unable to pick up a broom and sweep the floors?  Are you unable to wash the dishes you see in the sink when you get home?  Are you unable to teach your children that it's after dinner and now we're all going to clean the kitchen?  If the answer to these questions is \"no,\" then you have an immediate way to fix what's irritating you: you put your bag down, change from your work clothes, and sweep the floors.  Stop making YOUR frustration at unswept floors into HER problem and do something about it.  I promise you that doing your share of day-to-day household work--not just the once a week you do laundry, but the daily grind--will go waaaaaaaay further than words at getting your wife to trust you when you say you want things to get better.\n\nFinally, how old are the children?  Are they old enough that they can get to/from school on their own and can reasonably take care of themselves between end of the school day and whenever your or your wife get home?  Are they old enough that they can take a place in the household chore rotation?  If not, then you need to really, truly get it into your head how much this limits your wife's ability to find a job outside the home.  If the cost of child care is more than her wage-earning potential is worth, that's a big limitation.  If she has to be available at 4pm to pick the kids up, that's a big limitation.  If you never thought about this before, like you never thought about how much household work she was doing, then I strongly recommend that you sit down and honestly discuss this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO ADD: OP in another comment you say that you got the dog during CVD lockdowns when your wife was already homeschooling the kids and didn't have time to train a dog, you know the dog is a problem, your wife has told you the dog is a problem so often without you doing anything that she's no longer bothering to tell you how much of a problem the dog is.  Again, if you want to get your wife to trust you when you say things will get better, then you need to stop making YOUR dog into HER problem and start training the dog.\n\nEDIT 2: You say the OLDEST child is 12.  That means that the younger ones are grade-school age and absolutely cannot be left at home unsupervised.  So...who cares for the kids after school?  Who picks them up/drops them off, if you're not in a place with school buses?  I guarantee you that this is a huge reason your wife is having trouble finding a job....she HAS a full time job, it's care work, and the kind of part-time jobs she's looking for want a full-time commitment.  \n\nOP, please, please, please get marriage counseling and take some initiative with household management if you want to stay married.", "You both need counseling.

If your wife has applied for 180 jobs in two months and is getting no hits, I can understand her being demoralized and wanting to just stop looking.  Can you help her network?  Let everyone you know, know that she is looking.", "Is it possible you\u2019ve not seen it first hand because she\u2019s been cleaning up that destruction?", "Am I the only one that finds it odd she just had a picture ready and that you have never seen you house look like that nor hear he complain about it. Does she just let the dog do whatever when you leave in the am.", "That's actually untrue. Depression can be so debilitating that one cannot hold down a job. That is when it's absolutely necessary to seek help. I mean, people unalive themselves due to depression, it can get that bad. Depression affects people differently & there are varying levels of severity.", "OP is the AH. If you read his other comments, he blames his wife for not being able to hack her job, while he got FIRED from the same job when he took it over after she left.   \n\n\nAnd he has the nerve to complain about the condition of the house that is thoroughly cleaned every week, just not up to his dumb specifications? He can do it if he thinks it's so easy and doesn't take any time at all.", "Why in the world did you think that was a good time to bring home a high energy dog?! \n\nI'm not going to call you an asshole, but you are painfully oblivious. \n\nTell her to truly do nothing for a day. See what it looks like. Then decide if she is really not doing anything. My bet? She's doing a lot more than you realize. \n\nThe dog - unless your wife agreed to it and agreed to take on the responsibility of having it, that's all on you. If *you* cannot properly train and care for it, you need to rehome it/pay for it to go to doggy daycare/something, not push it off on your wife. From the sound of things, this dog isn't even a good fit for your family/home.", "Truthfully, I do see both sides and originally was torn between saying E S H or N T A, but it is the way he presenting the information that made me start to second guess the narrative he is telling. Clearly his wife is going through a lot right now and his reaction he described in this post shows a lack of communication and sympathy. Is she guilty too of the same thing? Probaby. But I don't think it is our job on this sub to simply validate people's feelings by telling them N T A just because the other person in the situation is also acting sucky.", "Thank you for defending me. I will say however that she didn't take the pictures to prove anything to me. I questioned that. But she pulled up messages of her venting to her cousin, who she sent the pictures to and tons more of the house in shambles and was basically just showing her to talk it out and vent. I've always known my dog was unruly and that my wife resents the dog because of the destructiveness that my dog creates. So it truly wasn't to show me or to prove anything to me. She was venting to her cousin and trying to calm herself down before lashing out at me about my animal.", "She should spend a day doing nothing, like you insinuated, so you can get a clearer picture of what nothing looks like.", "Wow.  That is some toxic stuff right there. YTA", "Lol yes I\u2019m aware doesn\u2019t change what I said. You think he wants to work? No he does because he has no other choice. Like I guess she does. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that her job is to care for the house since she doesn\u2019t want to get a paying job. Her pay is not having to work lol.

YTA", "She has severe PTSD. That's why she won't let me just watch the kids while she goes out. Something she does need to work on, of course, and I encourage it. But her ex royally fucked her up. So not only does she not let her kids out of her sight unless they are at school or with her mother, but she also experiences panic attacks thinking something bad will happen and she won't get to them in time. The kids do not walk the dog, no. That one is on me though. The kids are young and all build really teeny tiny like (even the 12yo boy is short and stocky) so my dog would easily carry them around the block 6x over and it's not safe. I bring the dog to the dog park when I get home from work for a couple hours a night but even when she gets home she still has an overwhelming amount of energy. She never settles.", "I got the dog when she was home with the kids full time for schooling.", "I no longer work there, no. I got fired shortly after she quit. They gave me her position when she left and it all went to shit basically. I work for another company that is looking for help but I'm honestly afraid to even have her start working there because if she quits, it's going to come back on me. Quilty by association. That sounds incredibly selfish of me but if we both aren't working, we are screwed and I don't trust that I wouldn't be penalized in some way if she were to just not show up for work.", "She's been complaining about the dog since I got the dog. She didn't show me the pictures because she is tired of constantly raising the issue of how unruly the dog is. On this I will defend her to the death honestly. My dog is super high strung.

She sent those pictures to her cousin to vent out her frustrations.", "She has severe PTSD and huge panic attacks in the event of her leaving the house sometimes because she is afraid something will happen to the kids and her not being able to get the phone call.

He very clearly did zero research before getting an extremely high energy dog and is surprised his wife can\u2019t handle it.", "What are you going to do about the dog now that you know?", "You need to rehome that dog. You aren't looking after it. She never even wanted it.", "Maybe he should spend a day not working to show her what it\u2019s like when he quits his job too lmao.", "She does want a paying job, if you take in to consideration all the job applications she has sent out over the course of the past two months. But thank you for understanding.", "Yeesh. It honestly sounds like she's struggling to just maintain.\n\nWhat breed/age of dog? And does it get any exercise in the morning? A breed like a German shepherd, or herding dogs like border collies need minimum 2 hours of active exercise per day. If the dog isn't getting any of that in the morning your wife gets to deal with all that energy until you get home.", "So\u2026 you got a pet when she would be the one who would have to care for it the majority of the time?\n\nPlease tell me y\u2019all at least agreed to get it.", "And what provision did you make to take care of the dog. \"You\" got a dog, but you were working all day, so you dumped the dog on her.

But how have you never seen your house trashed if it happens everyday? Does it happen after you leave?

I had such a bad attack day before yesterday that for the first time, I cried. I\u2019m going to have to find another doctor. But I looked up ptsd to try and learn more. I learned that it is considered a disability and you can get paid because you can\u2019t work. So, if she can\u2019t work and you live in the US, you should help her apply for that. I doubt it pays enough to live on but it would be extra income in the household.", "Has she seen a therapist? Is she in therapy right now? She needs to be so she can try to work on getting to a place where she can work or having them navigate if she can get disability.", "Oof, I think a lot of opinions are being circulated based of obvious biased situations that have been dealt with by yourselves personally. I did put in the post that she generates income on her gaming apps, as well as gets child support. All the kids expenses are completely covered and hardly ever come out of my pocket (unless it's a birthday or special treat). I'm simply frustrated on the financial aspect because of the regular every day bills.

What an excellent idea lmao", "Oh, you mean the job that he then got and was fired from?", "Is she qualified for the jobs she applying for. That seems like a lot of applications to not get a single job. Has she tried applying for jobs at a lower pay or a job outside her field? maybe it\u2019s just my city right now. It everyone\u2019s hiring, so I may just not get the market in your area. Is it flooded right now?", "I usually don't have time in the morning to exercise her, no. So I'm actually not sure what kind of breed my dog is. I was told when I got her that she was a Heeler mix (they didn't know the other breed apparently) but now that she is older she kind of looks like a Shepard of some sort.", "She didn't say she didn't want a dog?", "\"She quit a toxic job where she was set up to fail, blamed when she did, and was used to make an example to terrify other employees into line, and I wish she had been more resilient.  Oh yeah, and I took the same job she did and was fired because it all went to shit.  But I wish she had stayed working in the toxic environment even though I have another job, and I'm afraid to bring her on at my new job because she has standards and self-respect and might not let them abuse her because that might reflect badly on me.\"\n\nJesus wept.", "It definitely happens after I leave. My dog has goes nuts when I'm not around. I think due to her having some attachment to me.", "She was in therapy until COVID. When COVID hit and everything shut down, her therapist let her go and stop accepting state medical insurance, which is what she has because of the kids. She's tried getting back in to therapy but there's wait lists or just not accepting state insurance.", "I get that and that was my point. If you don\u2019t work there are probably a huge amount of bills that can\u2019t be covered by her income. And I\u2019m super curious what games she\u2019s playing that she makes any money.

But she has also applied to Walmart and McDonald's and gotten no where with those.", "If she really is a heeler you\u2019re the asshole based off that alone. Not only are you an asshole for dumping an extremely high energy WORKING dog on your wife with no job or training while she was already overloaded with your kids and your house full time. You are also an asshole for getting a dog that you don\u2019t have the resources to properly care for. Your wife is drowning.

You're upset your wife isn't getting enough done even though you clearly don't have or make time for this dog, either?", "I imagine there's quite a lot of things that she hasn't said that she doesn't want. From your posts, it's quite clear that she doesn't want the dog, doesn't derive benefit from having the dog, and would not have chosen to get a dog by herself.", "Did she agree to getting one?

They lie about what they will pay and how many hours they give. They lay you off asa they don\u2019t need you and they give you just enough hours to where you can\u2019t get insurance while also suggesting you apply for Medicaid and food stamps. That there is the American dream. Sounds to me like she\u2019s got a husband problem not a job problem. You yourself got fired from a job she quit but you act like she\u2019s lazy. It\u2019s really hard to think you\u2019re worthy of things when even your own husband things your a dreg on society.", "Has she considered being a nanny? I\u2019m a professional nanny. I have a ece degree and about 7 years professional nanny experience and I make $23.5 in a lcol state. While she may not be able to start at a rate like that she can make good money with good benefits as a nanny. And since she has a degree she in ece she will likely be able to find a job even if it\u2019s part time. A lot of people need back up care and sick care during this season. Maybe that can be an option for her. If she hasn\u2019t already considered it.

Does she have to pay at all to play? Like for coins or whatever.

Coming from someone who has worked paycheck to paycheck or close too. If you don\u2019t have pto one day can ruin your budget.", "I\u2019m a huge animal lover and am a big advocate for trying everything you can before rehoming an animal.
