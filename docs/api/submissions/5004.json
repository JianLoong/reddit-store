She had gotten engaged a couple months ago and her wedding is coming up fairly soon. While planning the wedding with her she said that I would be a part of the bridal party and that I would be the maid of honor at the wedding. To me it made since that I would be since I was helping a lot with planning the wedding with her. Well yesterday She informed me that not only would I not be the maid of honor at her wedding but that I would also not be in the bridal party since she wanted to include her fiance's sisters in the bridal party. I wasn't necessarily upset about not being maid of honor but to be completely taken out of the bridal party made me irritated as the sisters didn't help with the wedding planning at all, not to mention that I am her sister. I told her that I was upset that I wouldn't be in the bridal party and that being her sister I should at least be part of it. She told me that I was just being a selfish asshole of saying that. I informed my sister that since I wasn't going to be a part of the bridal party that I would not be going to the wedding because of that and being called selfish. My sister told me that I should still go to the wedding because I was her sister but I told her that obviously me being her sister didn't matter enough to be in the bridal party and stuck to it that I would not be going if I wasn't in the party.

Your sister just doesn't want people asking why you're not there.", "NTA, and I'd do the same thing. To revoke it just to include her in-laws who didn't even help? I'd feel that she didn't respect my efforts to make her wedding plans with her. I don't blame you for not going.", "NTA I feel like there's something else going on here. Is it possible her fiance pressed her to include his family in the bridal party and kick you out? Also, you mentioned that she was planning on you helping with a lot of her wedding stuff, is it possible she was just lying about the maid of honor thing to take advantage of your time and she never actually planned to involve you?\n\nEither way, I wouldn't go to her wedding if I were you.

But in the end it is her wedding.\n\nIf there is no reason for my first two question NTA.", "NTA, but as a couple of other commentators here have said I suspect the husband may have been involved in this decision if you are being pushed out _completely_ in favour of his sisters. Going from promised maid of honour to being not in the bridal party completely without you being responsible for some travesty is a real punch in the gut so I have the feeling there\u2019s more to this somehow. \n\nAt a good moment see if your sister will tell you whose decision this was and who came up with the idea. Anything less than this being _her_ call \u2014 not _their_ call, _her_ call \u2014 suggests that his fingerprints are on this change somewhere. EDIT: and if it is her call and she takes responsibility for it, I feel like she owes you a better reason than that.", "NTA she used you for the planning and then subbed you out once it was done.\n\nAnd I don't get how including her fianc\u00e9's sister's in the bridal party means excluding her own sister?", "NTA", "NTA, I read a story about a girl was part of the bridal party, but at the beginning of the wedding the photographer got sick, and she was assigned to be the photographer and got her dress and bridesmaid gift bracelet removed and given to the new bridesmaid girl.", "NTA at all.  Your sister is a huge AH for prioritizing her future SIL over you.", "INFO\n\nWhy can't all of you be bridesmaids?\n\nHave you mentioned to your sister that this is important because you love her, and a bridesmaid is somebody who stands up next to the bride supporting her decision to choose this man for her lifelong partner? Well it sounds nice to include the sister-in-law to be, they are part of her future life while you were part of her present and future, that you feel pushed out.\n\nPut aside the help that you've given for the sister, not every bride is appreciative of the health they receive nor do they reciprocate when a helpful bridesmaid ultimately gets married. It's unfortunate it sounds like your sister is focused on many other things other than you, you may approach it by saying you feel pushed out and unloved which surprises you because you've always been close.\n\nShe is your sister and the choice to not attend the wedding at all is a big one, it's the type of decision that will pull families apart and often create a long-term dysfunctional dynamics, you certainly can make that decision, you just have to decide if the juice is worth the squeeze. Not everybody will agree with you and your choice, are you willing to accept the consequences if you choose to not attend the wedding? The question is while you do not like her behavior today, do you still love her as a sister? If you love her, attend the wedding, there's always time in the future to talk about how you felt, right now she doesn't seem receptive to that.", "NAH. She is reaping the consequences of her own decision. Technically all decisions are hers because it's her wedding, but you don't have to attend given how little she seems to prioritize her relationship with you.", "NTA but WHY did she do this? Gotta be more than just wanting the sisters in there. Did her fianc\u00e9 say something? WTF.", "She gets you to do the work & THEN tcuts you out of the role she asked you to fill. NTA. Let her explain your absence.", "NTA tell her you will go to the wedding but you will be sure to explain to everyone why you aren\u2019t in the wedding party, with lots of details", "NTA- you were told you were maid of honor, you did the work, and now she's kicking you in favor of her new SIL's? If she had the decency to apologize and explain herself i might let it go, but to turn this around and make you look like the bad guy?  I wouldn't go either. Her behavior is rude and disrespectful. I'd book myself a spa day for that day and just treat yourself.", "NTA. There aren't actually rules about how many bridesmaids you can have. My sister had four bridesmaids while her husband had two groomsmen. They didn't escort us down the aisle, and even if they had, either it would have been two ladies for each gentleman or two of the bridesmaids could have paired up, or the groom could have escorted his sister, there were any number of ways it could have gone. \n\nYour sister's fianc\u00e9 could have had his sisters stand up on his side if having them in the bridal party was so important to him. Kicking you out was definitely an AH move, and you're not wrong to choose not to attend, but you might want to consider what the long-term implications on your relationship with your sister might be and if you can live with them. It's easy for a bunch of strangers to tell you, \"Stand your ground,\" but how will you feel a year from now, five, ten? This is a big day for your sister, and if you're close to her you may regret not being there, even though you're angry now.", "NTA. Also make sure to tell everyone who asks the full story", "nta - It was lame of your sister to do this, especially since there's no max number of bridesmaids, but consider going regardless. If you're really that close to her, you don't want her being a weirdo diva for her wedding to be the thing that spoils your relationship.", "1. NAH.\n2.

She's actually the asshole for using you to help her make all the arrangements and then excluding you from being a part of the wedding while calling you selfish. Don't know why she's acting like this but yes stay home and let her explain why her sister isn't there.", "NTA. She took advantage of your help and assumed you\u2019d be okay with being removed form the party just because your her sister.  She doesn\u2019t deserve your hard work or for you to accommodate for her being a shitty older sister.  Speaking as an eldest sibling.", "NTA.  She used you for help with plans then dumped you.  Nope she\u2019s just your typical bridezillas.", "NTA", "Nope.", "NTA\n\nYou not going does **not** make you selfish. Your sister is at fault here and probably just doesn\u2019t want to explain to everyone why you aren\u2019t there. I agree with others that something is going on - likely her fianc\u00e9 somehow affected this decision. \n\nMaybe ask your sister why she is taking you out completely? Why not include you all? Her answer will likely tell you everything you need to know.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing demoted out of the bridal party is a good reason not to go to a wedding. It would be different if she had not asked you in the first place, but she TOLD you you would be MOH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: Don't go.", "NTA.  If your sister allowed her fianc\u00e9 to strong arm her into pushing you out of the wedding that says a lot about her and him.  Don\u2019t go.  If you can, go on a day trip or have a pamper me day.  Let her and fianc\u00e9 try to explain why you weren\u2019t there.", "I'm confused, was the planning of the wedding since she got engaged or before the engagement(like childhood fantasy plans)?  \n\nAs presented, I'd say NTA. Because apparently, she promised you a position in the bridal party and even if it was \"fantasy pre-planning\" there is no reason she couldn't have had you as a bridesmaid while still having the future SILs in the bridal party(why do they get precedence??)  \n\nPlus as you said she called you an A-H.  So she's made her choices and now you are making yours.  Since you have no role in the wedding, you have no requirement to be there.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she promised you that role to scam you into doing the legwork and once majority of the legwork was done she pulled the rug. Bait and switch. \n\nShe wants you there so no one asks where you are. Be prepared she will most likely make something up, so get ahead and just casually drop into conversations that you\u2019re sad she took the role away from you after making you do the hard work so that she looked good for her future SILs.", "Nta", "NTA. Please keep that shiny backbone and don\u2019t go. Your sister is a USER. She stringed you along to get help for free then dumped you to score brownie points with the in laws. She does not deserve your presence in her wedding. Do yourself a favor a go at least LC - your user of a sister has shown you exactly how little she values you and how fast she can dump you in favor of her in laws. Run! Don\u2019t give in. Do NOT attend the wedding no matter how much pressure you get. There\u2019s no going back from here anyway.", "NTA\n\nJust really think though if this is a hill you're willing to die on, because very likely your sister may not speak to you for a very long time or ever. In my opinion this is a chance to take the high road; show up do your family duties then tell her after the wedding and honeymoon that she's severely damaged your relationship", "ESH- it\u2019s not your wedding. It\u2019s your sisters wedding. She has every right to decide whatever she wants to decide. I don\u2019t understand why people think they have a right to throw a fit about how anyone else has their own wedding. What she did was shady and rude, and it seems like there is way more to the story\u2026 but that said, it\u2019s her day and she can decide what she wants. Go to the wedding, have your own fun and let it be. You can\u2019t control what happens, but you can control how you choose to react.", "ESH. Her cutting you out is shitty. You being petty and refusing to go unless you get to be in the bridal party is also shitty.", "It\u2019s not the lack of help that bothers me. The bridal party has lives and sometimes they can\u2019t help as much. Which is understandable. What bothers me is the bridal party is supposed to be the people closest to you. I don\u2019t get why she would bump OP for his sisters instead of just adding a groomsman if they\u2019re worried about even numbers", "I don't really have a relationship with her fiance, so I don't know", "*Tiffany* bracelet at that.", "Maybe,  or maybe there is coercive control and domestic abuse,  and OP should help her sister scabs from her fiancee. \n\nJust seems so weird", "Just wait until SILsTB help zero from now to the wedding.", "She's already done it. Fianc\u00e9's sister's step in her shoes once the planning has been done.", "She already did the heavy lifting so to speak.", "Why? Her sister clearly used her and told her lies about her being in the bridal party. Like if this is coming from the fiance then this is very wrong it shows what he thinks about OP. in my view if OPs sister wants her to be in the wedding so much she should make and effort to include everyone", "So you are fine with OP being used for labour and because the sister is getting married and she can do whatever she wants because it is her day? OP is choosing to react how she wants to a shitty situation.", "I'm sorry your sister did you dirty like that. Hopefully she can come clean to you eventually, but I'd definitely skip this wedding.", "I would and did help my sister plan her wedding without being in the party. She wanted girlfriends, not siblings. I still helped every chance I got, still went to the bachelorette party, and understood her choice of her bridal party. So I don\u2019t think helping her plan the wedding is \u201cbeing used as labor\u201d. You can help people without expecting anything in return.", "And of course OP can choose how she wants to react! She came here to ask about being an AH and this is my opinion. The whole point is sharing opinions.", "Did your sister tell you that you were MOH during all the planning, then take it back right before the actual wedding? That's that part that makes the sister TA.", "The judgement here is not about the bride. I agree, rude move to tell her she had a position and then take it away. Totally AH move. But in regards to OP, I do think it is an AH move to decide to no longer go to the wedding because she isn\u2019t in the bridal party. Yes, her sister is rude for changing her mind. But it seems like an AH move for OP to make it so about her as to bail on the wedding. - food for thought- imagine we saw this from the brides side \u201cAITA for telling my sister that she would be MOH but then changing my mind as the wedding grew closer? Now she is threatening not to come to the wedding at all\u201d. In that situation we would wonder what happened to make her change the mind but we would also say \u201cit\u2019s your wedding, you have the right to make your own choices.\u201d I feel like we aren\u2019t seeing the full picture of why the bride changed her mind.", "It's beyond rude, it's downright insulting. If I were treated that way, it would pretty much kill my relationship with my sister.", "When were bridesmaid dresses ordered?  There\u2019s usually substantial lead time to make them. The answer could help you find out when your sister\u2019s bridal party plans changed.", "Dont forget the fact that OP was already doing much of the planning for the event as well.\n\nNTA. Hell, OP. Make like Kermit and sip some tea as everything to do with this wedding is no longer your problem to worry about.", ">The judgement here is not about the bride.\n\nWhaaaat. Are we not judging both sides anymore? So ESH and NTA are not legitimate judgments anymore?", "NTA", "NTA"]}
