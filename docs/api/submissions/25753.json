Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of sacrificing if no one can enjoy it?", "NTA. You want to live your style without showing off. Her wishes are probably not even about money, but not making status more important than function. The borderline, in my POV, is to separate comfort and nice functionality from just showing off. I would pay for new dependable/powerful gadgets or more comfortable car or house in better area (safer, cleaner, friendlier). So, when she asks for some reasonable upgrade (keeping up is not a functional reason), I would consider it seriously. Or I would separate incomes, so she'd be able to buy whatever she wants for her own leftover money after all bills and savings you both agreed on are paid.", "After reading comments i\u2019d say NTA  but maybe compromise on something.

So we spend $$ on travel and experiences, and also we have nice cars. \n\nI hate the idea of buying stuff just because she wants to show off or keep up with the other women (do any of them work????). But maybe upgrade your clothes a bit and get her a later model nice used car she enjoys.", "OP do not compromise on your attitude towards spending money.  Your practice is successful right now, sure.  But what happens if things get tough later on?

Trying to \"keep up with the jones\" doesn't mean you will be happy, and by the sounds of it she won't be happy uess you continue to spend money on items that flaunt your wealth. \n..\nMaybe a little compromise but don't totally give in to her demands, she needs to realise what your about and respect you just as much. \n..\nGood luck though, she sounds like a handful", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is so much like my husband and me. We have joint accounts. His business is doing well for now. I love luxury items and have a list of items I want to own before certain milestones. He only likes cars. Except that, he gets what is comfortable. If Prada shoes are comfy, he gets them. If H&M shoes sold for $15 is comfy, he gets that. But we came to the realization that in his line of work (and possibly my future line of work), what we wear and drive etc will affect our business development and income level. For instance, he has to play golf so that business deals take place. I have to wear nice things so I get accepted by the members of that community/class.

I\u2019m not saying go into massive debt but by your own accord you make more than $150-200k a year. Since you don\u2019t appear to have many of any debt- what is so wrong about upgrading to a better house? If she agrees to go back to work to afford a better car then compromise and get the damn house. If for any other reason- do it because you actually care for your wife and are willing to meet some of her wants. Who cares what others think? Well, apparently your wife since you took her into that world. In my opinion she needs to grow a spine and stop trying to spend frivolously just for the sake of appearances.
