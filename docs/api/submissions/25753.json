Her wishes are probably not even about money, but not making status more important than function. The borderline, in my POV, is to separate comfort and nice functionality from just showing off. I would pay for new dependable/powerful gadgets or more comfortable car or house in better area (safer, cleaner, friendlier). So, when she asks for some reasonable upgrade (keeping up is not a functional reason), I would consider it seriously.

So we spend $$ on travel and experiences, and also we have nice cars. \n\nI hate the idea of buying stuff just because she wants to show off or keep up with the other women (do any of them work????). But maybe upgrade your clothes a bit and get her a later model nice used car she enjoys.", "OP do not compromise on your attitude towards spending money.  Your practice is successful right now, sure.  But what happens if things get tough later on?

Trying to \"keep up with the jones\" doesn't mean you will be happy, and by the sounds of it she won't be happy uess you continue to spend money on items that flaunt your wealth. \n..\nMaybe a little compromise but don't totally give in to her demands, she needs to realise what your about and respect you just as much. \n..\nGood luck though, she sounds like a handful", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is so much like my husband and me. We have joint accounts. His business is doing well for now. I love luxury items and have a list of items I want to own before certain milestones. He only likes cars. Except that, he gets what is comfortable. If Prada shoes are comfy, he gets them. If H&M shoes sold for $15 is comfy, he gets that. But we came to the realization that in his line of work (and possibly my future line of work), what we wear and drive etc will affect our business development and income level. For instance, he has to play golf so that business deals take place. I have to wear nice things so I get accepted by the members of that community/class.

Instead of driving a Mercedes, BMW, or whatever like her friends, she drives a Hyundai. I do not wear handmade Italian suits, have an everyday watch. Hell, I still wear and buy anime tees.\n\nI feel as if I dress and act like a normal person.", "I disagree the memories formed will last a lifetime.", "This really depends on what you mean by \u201ccasual.\u201d I can see why, if your wife dresses well when, for example, you\u2019re out to dinner with your friends, and you\u2019re wearing a t shirt and shorts, that\u2019s annoying. If it\u2019s about specific brands that indicate wealth (designer, Rolex watches, etc) then it\u2019s less reasonable. \n\nHowever I\u2019ll add: why doesn\u2019t she work? If she\u2019s raising your kids or you\u2019ve agreed that she stays home, then you can\u2019t be so tight fisted, especially when she knows you as a couple can afford it. If you\u2019re the only one earning, that doesn\u2019t mean your money philosophy automatically wins. Meet her halfway.", "In that case I can see your wife\u2019s point. I am all about being frugal!!! I tell my husband all the time I\u2019d rather have money put in savings than get presents. But your wife deserves a safe car to drive. She deserves a decent (not an extremely expensive home but decent) home in a safe place. You may be ok driving a car that can break down on you at 10 pm but if I had to guess you\u2019re a man so you\u2019re cool with having to call and get help while hanging out.", "Sometimes old things are just old, like maybe your clothes, if she wants you to have a  more age appropriate wardrobe.  I don\u2019t think she\u2019s asking much if you are still wearing things that are as old as your car.  If your house is in a safe area, great. The state of your car is your business.  I see where she is coming from though.\n\nEditing:   There is nothing wrong with replacing old. Sometimes something new may actually be better, especially if one researches it and puts money into a good solid item.", "How long have you lived in your house? I was the breadwinner while ex husband went to school or worked PT and I will say that I was the one who chose to upgrade. Why? Because it was so nice to be in a new and more comfortable space. If you can afford a better home (better neighborhood and safer feeling for your wife) why are you so reluctant to compromise? I\u2019m not saying go into massive debt but by your own accord you make more than $150-200k a year. Since you don\u2019t appear to have many of any debt- what is so wrong about upgrading to a better house? If she agrees to go back to work to afford a better car then compromise and get the damn house. If for any other reason- do it because you actually care for your wife and are willing to meet some of her wants. Who cares what others think? Well, apparently your wife since you took her into that world. In my opinion she needs to grow a spine and stop trying to spend frivolously just for the sake of appearances. Is it ok to grab that designer handbag for a special occasion? Absolutely!! And maybe she needs to work and feel that sense of achievement. But it should be for HER, not for the opinion of others.", "Agree 100%.  A car gets you from one place to another.  ignore anyone who is douchey enough to believe a car is status.  If you have a paid for house or low mortgage rate stay put for immediate future.  Take the family on a nice trip as memories and experiences are ten times more valuable than an expensive purse or jewelry.   Too many look at me people today.", "\u2026 yeah the picture you\u2019re painting here is of someone who\u2019s not just being frugal, but having a hard time letting go of the trappings of youth. \n\nLook I get it. I drove a 25 year old car until it died. I own an apartment in a working-class part of town and you\u2019ll never see me want to \u201cupgrade\u201d to a single-family home in the burbs. I have tattoos and piercings. But\u2026 I clean up nice. I get good haircuts. I spend real money on quality basics like bags, shoes, jackets, polished jeans, and nice work shirts, sweaters and tees. You can be casual and comfortable and even anime-inspired without coming across like you\u2019re stuck in your early 20\u2019s. Maybe there\u2019s some great contemporary Japanese menswear in your future or something? Or some baseball caps and sweatshirts that have subtler embroidered logos?\n\nYou may have to be really clear and firm with her that you\u2019re not going to play the whole toxic game of keeping up with the Joneses. Explain how frugality can make space for really investing in what you both value, maybe even allow you to splash out on a luxury item or two for her on an annual basis. But pay attention to what the values are behind what she\u2019s asking. For example do you have room to entertain at your home? Do you show up looking raggedy at parent teacher night? Is your car safe and comfy for a road trip? That is where you\u2019re going to have to give a little.\n\nI think this is the path to compromise. Good luck!", "Anime is cool. As part of the compromise maybe look into anime themes collared shirt? Etsy has a few themed polos. NAH. Communicate and compromise needed", "Is it just when you\u2019re out with friends that she\u2019s judging your wardrobe, or when you\u2019re just at home or heading to the grocery store or something. \n\nI\u2019m a woman and, while I\u2019m not remotely into anime, god help the man who tries to tell me I can wear my ancient ripped up jeans and concert t-shirt.", "Are you defending her in any way when they make these comments? Are you reassuring her that she's okay and they're just assholes? \n\nYou dragged her into this environment where she doesn't fit in and they make sure she knows it. You may not care what they think of you but she clearly does. You should be supporting her, not brushing off her worries.\n\nAnd that doesn't necessarily mean keeping up with them in a material sense either. Maybe your wife would benefit from counselling to help her manage these encounters. Idk if her not going back to work after lockdown was something you both agreed on, but you should probably revisit that. Does she want to get a job? Or is there a way you can restructure the finances so she has a little more freedom and can be more involved in those decisions? Can you talk to her and find out what the actual problem is and find a solution where she feels like you have her back?", "It matters to her, obviously.  You're imposing your (rather unusual) values on her, and she's getting tired of it.  Good luck.", "You obviously do care. A lot.\n\n\nOtherwise you'd just be like \"Here's the credit card, have fun\".", "If your wife would genuinely grab every dollar and spend it, you have a different issue. Is she not financially literate?", "Uh, that\u2019s exactly how joint accounts work in the US.  Either of you can clean out the account.", "\u201cJoint finances\u201d means joint decision making. You do not have joint finances. \n\nBeing the \u201cprimary\u201d (\ud83e\udd2e) and getting final say removes the agency of your partner, putting them in a vulnerable position, both in terms of their financial position and the rest of their life decisions, as they\u2019re beholden to you for resources. Such a toxic dynamic.", "You said you travel often which is definitely a signifier of wealth even if you don\u2019t divulge the specifics.\n\nHow do you divide responsibilities at home?", "Oh god, you\u2019re wearing your college anime tees and you\u2019re an grown adult with a serious career.  She\u2019s embarrassed by your clothing.  This is really an easy and cheap upgrade that will last for years.  Just ask her to buy you a couple outfits.  See how that goes.\n\nOf all the issues in this post, the clothes are the easiest to fix, and she\u2019s probably right, honestly.  She\u2019s not asking much to want you to dress like a grown up.", "Her car is not as old as mine. She has a 2015 car she bought when she was working. It still runs great.  Our home is in a safe area, may not be gated community safe but it is safe.", "This is generally my mindset. I do get where she is coming from and why I will look for a compromise.", "When we road trip I normally rent an RV. About the clothes less about being stuck in my 20's and just wearing what I like when I can. The way I see it I have to be stuffy in a suit and act a certain way / maintain a certain presence at work. When I am not at work or in more casual settings I just want to be comfortable and myself. \n\nNot like I can be myself at work lol.", "I am not around when her friends make comments, I just used it as an example. The people I work with have never said anything about my wife to my face or my knowledge. She views them as her friends me calling them assholes will not go over very well. \n\nIt was her choice not to go back to work. My wife has never really liked to work she just did so because she had to. I know what the problem is my wife is not afraid of speaking her mind. She wants to live in a way that reflects our wealth. I will talk to her in the morning about maybe seeing if she would be up to  going back to work part time then using all the money she earns however see sees fit.", "How is fiscal responsibility and not buying things you don\u2019t need just for appearances an \u201cunusual\u201d value?", "I doubt going here's the credit card, have fun is ever the smart thing to do financially.", "Nah, you can make it so that cannot happen. You can set it up with the bank for massive withdrawals both parties need to agree. Same with our investments I cannot have our accountant liquid them without her okay and vice versa.\n.", "See this is where the real world and ideals clash. Hard to have a joint discussion when you have no checks in place and leave it up to the honor system. As I said without checks my wife could have easily bought a 150k car.  Hell, our account would also alert my wife if I tried to buy something for 50k or 150k. She would be able to block the transactions also by telling our accountant to hold the funds.\n\nJust being realistic.", "Without knowing the specifics travel can mean going to PA for a weekend. I get what you are trying to say. Agree to disagree.", "What is wrong with that? Not like I wear them to work, trust me I would if I could. I also do buy new ones.", "Question for you: honestly\u2026(maybe even ask your wife)\u2026does she feel safe there?", "You could also view it as a kindness to someone who needs an older car that's been looked after etc if you upgrade. I don't know if you're hoarding wealth, but consider making choices like spending locally in small businesses etc to help other folks :)", "My husband makes good money and he loves buying things. But what I\u2019ve learned is he will pay more for the items that should last and cheap out on others. For instance when I met him he had a fifteen year old Lexus. He finally replaced it two years later for a new hybrid Lexus which he plans to ride until it dues, like the other. We\u2019re both the same way with phones and computers, but it was very frustrating when ten year old couches were falling apart and he saw o need for new ones. It took them causing back pain before he would spend the money on simple leather couches. \n\nMy suggestion is discuss with your wife what both your priorities and desires are and find a way to compromise.", "Yeah nah you can build a really great casual wardrobe that incorporates the things that you like. I would really have a discussion with your wife about this part, because it\u2019s very probable that your wife is *into* your professional look or a more casual version of it. Remember that all clothes are performance, and step it up. \n\nAs for the RV thing, it might be worth crunching the numbers and seeing whether repeated rental fees are actually quite a bit of $$$ compared to just buying a car that would work well for trips. Or maybe she wants to explore the wide world of hotels where you can sleep in a king size bed and take a nice hot bath? \n\nAnyway you\u2019re married now \u2014 being yourself is great, figuring out how to be yourself as part of a real team is much better. The \u201cI normally do it this way and it\u2019s fine\u201d mentality doesn\u2019t cover it for your spouse, your life partner. Figure out what will work for you both and grow into that space with her.", "Her part time work won\u2019t cover the kind of upgrades she wants. Not saying you\u2019re being unfair, but that\u2019s not really a compromise", "Of course not. But don't say that you don't care. And the accounts aren't fully joint if you are blocking purchases.\n\n\nWhat were your financials like when you started dating your wife? When you got married? What agreements did you have in terms of splitting bills/expenses?", "FYI you\u2019re arguing marital finances with some combination of people who have never been on a date, people who have never worked, and actual children.", "Sounds like you don\u2019t trust your wife. You should get divorced if the trust is irrecoverable. \n\nAnd don\u2019t patronise me, I do live in the real world. Do you speak to your wife like that? \n\nYou\u2019ve cemented my YTA position.", "You do realize that gas is expensive, right? So even just driving a state or two over for a long weekend is beyond what many people can afford to do, even on rare occasions. So I'm sorry, but *any* kind of frequent travel is something that clearly tells other people that you have money, even if you do you level best avoid tell anyone where you're going.", "This particular issue isn\u2019t about money and you know it.  It isn\u2019t cute or countercultural or intellectual or whatever to look like an adult who rolled out of Hot Topic.  She obviously takes more pride in her appearance, which sounds like it wouldn\u2019t take much.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot between an Italian suit and an anime tee.  And it\u2019s not like this would take a lot of money.  Let her buy you a couple outfits and really hear her out on this one.", "I asked and she said no, and I asked how come she could never give me a straight answer. Our area is in a nice part of our city just not the nicest. It is more for the working class family.", "The I do not care was more so to her choosing not to work.\n\nWe met at university I was broke LOL. Yeah, they are, like most, they are just set so someone cannot just spend as they please. I cannot go and just take put 50k without my wife knowing either.", "She can also block my transactions, not like it is one-sided.", "Lol, your stretching it.", "Ok, but not in OP\u2019s socioeconomic circle. If everyone in your life is struggling to put food on the table, then yes, guess for a short road trip may be seen as \u201chaving money\u201d.

The thing is I do not care if others find it cute or whatever. I have to be a certain way at work, the last thing I want is to be forced to be a certain way in a casual setting. Not sure why people have issues with the clothes people wear, I am not really trying to impress anyone tbh.", "Women may not be able to pinpoint that 6th sense but they can tell you something isn\u2019t right. I attended a Christian university. A guy hit on me. Wanted to go to church with me. (A good Christian never turns someone down wanting to go to church.) BUT something felt wrong. He was a nice guy. Looked nice. But something wasn\u2019t right. He made me feel unsafe. He ended up marrying a friend of mine. Their marriage ended when she came home to 8 black SUVs and the FBI welcomed her into her own home. He had pictures of children he was buying and selling. We may not know what makes us uncomfortable but we know something is up.", "Is it a more diverse community?", "Yes, it is."]}
