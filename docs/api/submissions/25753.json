I will speak with her in the morning and try to come up with a compromise. Maybe I will suggest she can go back to work part-time. I will still cover every joint expense and the money she gets from work she can use however she sees fit.\n\nEdit: Did not expect to see this blowup. I have been given a lot to think about and have been enjoying the discussion that is being had. I do appreciate it.  \n\nMost likely will be my final edit. Did not expect this thread to blow up the way it did. I did enjoy the few discussion threads.

He was surprised and slightly disturbed that people jumped to so many conclusions based on some of the comments saying that I am no help, taking advantage of him, or maybe even financially abusing him, especially since I do contribute equally to all household expenses/savings.

Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of sacrificing if no one can enjoy it?", "NTA. You want to live your style without showing off. Her wishes are probably not even about money, but not making status more important than function. The borderline, in my POV, is to separate comfort and nice functionality from just showing off. I would pay for new dependable/powerful gadgets or more comfortable car or house in better area (safer, cleaner, friendlier). So, when she asks for some reasonable upgrade (keeping up is not a functional reason), I would consider it seriously.

He only likes cars. Except that, he gets what is comfortable. If Prada shoes are comfy, he gets them. If H&M shoes sold for $15 is comfy, he gets that. But we came to the realization that in his line of work (and possibly my future line of work), what we wear and drive etc will affect our business development and income level. For instance, he has to play golf so that business deals take place. I have to wear nice things so I get accepted by the members of that community/class.

I\u2019m not saying go into massive debt but by your own accord you make more than $150-200k a year. Since you don\u2019t appear to have many of any debt- what is so wrong about upgrading to a better house? If she agrees to go back to work to afford a better car then compromise and get the damn house. If for any other reason- do it because you actually care for your wife and are willing to meet some of her wants. Who cares what others think? Well, apparently your wife since you took her into that world. In my opinion she needs to grow a spine and stop trying to spend frivolously just for the sake of appearances.
