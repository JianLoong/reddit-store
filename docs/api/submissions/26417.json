The house is actually mine but due to many circumstances Adam lives with me. I Don't mind it as i like living with him and since i always travel for work i'm happy to have someone taking care of things while i'm away\n\nI have a best friend, Phill (33m), we met each other through online gaming and having been buddies ever since. Phill is a frequent visitor to our house, he'd come over to chill, play video games and have guys' nights when i'm in the country\n\nAround 7 years ago Phill married one of my best friends, Annie (34f). I was actually surprised when they first got together because Phil was a shy introverted guy with 0 experience with women and Annie was his complete opposite. She's extroverted, can make friends with anyone and had a few relationships under her belt, but they somehow made it work.\n\nLast year Annie filed for divorce because she discovered that Phill was having an affair with a coworker, i was outside of the country during that time so Adam was the one who kept me most informed about the situation but i was still in contact with both Phil and Annie and heard both of their sides\n\nTwo months after Annie first filled for divorce Phill franticly calls me asking me if i was in the country, i wasn't and i told him so, then he starts sobbing telling me that he saw Adam and Annie \"together\", if you catch my drift. After that call i called Adam and asked him to tell me what's going on and he told me that he and Annie had just gotten together. I wasn't exactly surprised that it happened, Adam always had a huge crush on Annie but he never made a move for many reasons. I genuinely thought he had moved on after she married because he never mentioned it again, but obviously he didn't\n\nit's been a long time since then, Phill and Annie's divorce got finalized, she and Adam are still together, i'm now spending less time travelling due to work and more time trying to support Phill and spend more time with my brother, everything was fine until a week ago\n\nI was spending time with Phill at his place when he suddenly asks me when i'm kicking Adam out, i got confused and told him i'm not kicking my brother out and why is he asking me that. Phill then went on a rant on how it's unfair that Adam stole his wife and didn't suffer any consequence for it and how as his best friend i should kick him out for being a homewrecker\n\nI told him he was being crazy and like hell was i kicking my own brother out like that. He didn't like that answer and kicked me out then said that he felt betrayed that i wouldn't even consider kicking Adam out for what he did\n\nAt the moment i thought i was right and i still think i shouldn't have to kick my brother out, but it's been a while since me and Phill last talked and i'm worried about him\n\nI just want to know, am i the asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1694119292, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cptt5/aita_for_going_against_my_best_friends_wishes_and/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ll  include a TLDR here because this is so confusing. \n\nYour friend, a cheater, wants you to evict your brother, for dating said cheater friends soon-to-be-ex-wife after she filed for divorce. \n\nMy opinion: friends who don\u2019t live with you don\u2019t get to dictate who lives with you, and cheaters don\u2019t get to complain when their SOs date other people (especially when said SO already filed for divorce)", "NTA - Adam didn't steal his wife.

As shitty as this might sound, Phill cheated on Annie. He doesnt really get a say. If he really cared about the relationship he wouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place. If everything is true, maybe the timing kinda sucks, but at least your brother waited until they broke up to make a move. Phill had no right to even suggest you kicking out your brother.\n\nAs far as worrying about Phill, you can try to keep reaching out to him, but sometimes people dont want to be saved and i think he is victimizing himself just a bit, cheaters often feel like everyone is against them, and want at least that one person to quote on quote, \u201cdefend\u201d them. \n\nYou\u2019ve been a good friend so far, try not to stress yourself out too much about it.", "NTA. Phil wrecked his own home when he had an affair. Sounds like Adam respectfully kept his feelings to himself while Annie was married and then decided to shoot his shot when she became single again.

And then gets mad because you don't kick out your flesh and blood over something that would not warrant being kicked out? Yeah, he can go kick rocks.", "NTA\n\nI suggest pointing out to Phil that his marriage fell apart because he cheated on Annie. So if there\u2019s a home wrecker in the story it\u2019s Phil and his affair partner.\n\nAdam and Annie have done nothing wrong. Phil is delusional and I would be distancing myself from him.", "NTA... Annie left Phil because HE cheated, and she got together with your brother after filing for divorce.... \n\nAnd despite all that, the house is YOURS, it doesnt matter if he is your best friend, he cannot dictate who you allow to live with you or not...

You are right and not remotely to blame for the mess your friend has made. \n\nWow, guy cheats on his wife then claims your brother \"stole\" the life he actually sabotaged?!\n\nLet him feel betrayed - ironic he's a cheater yet has issues with not-an-actual betrayal since it's...your brother. \n\nIt's overstepping AF for your friend to expect you to turn your back on your TWIN because he doesn't like the consequences of his own actions.", "NTA\n\n\\--This was inevitable. THere is no way that down the line Phil would continue to be friends as his ex-wife ( but still his wife in his head) is with your brother.", "NTA  Adam has done nothing wrong.  You are correct to resist Phil's ridiculous request.", "NTA - the cheater is the one who is left to suffer.  Adam and Annie didn't get together until AFTER Annie discovered Phil cheating and AFTER she filed for divorce (per your post) He does NOT get to cry foul in this.

So your \"friend\" is demanding to kick your brother out of YOUR HOME because he's butthurt that your brother and his ex have a relationship? Did I get that right? The \"friend\" isn't a good person.

Shame on you for continuing to be his friend.", "Your brother didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d his wife. She isn\u2019t an object to be stolen. He screwed up his own life by cheating on her.

Fucked around literally, found out and is hiding in denial.", "\"I cheated on my wife and she left me and is dating your twin, so please kick your twin out because I feel betrayed by him for doing nothing inappropriate\" - not the gotcha friend wants it to be.\n\nThey always love the f\\*\\*k around, but never the find out part...", "Ok, i never thought about it that way, ngl you made laugh a bit\n\nAs for Phill's excuse, he said he cheated because he and Annie were going through a rough patch in their relationship but i know that's a lie, he later on admitted to me when he was drunk that he did it because he was embarrassed that he married the first woman whom he had sex with", ">Hoisted by his own petard.\n\nThis phrase doesn't get used enough, bravo.", "From an outside perspective it's obvious, but in mine i was still hopeful we could still be friends, honestly i'm surprised we lasted this long seeing as me and Adam are almost identical (the difference being that he dyes his hair and has more tattoos). I just suck at letting things go", "This is what Phil admitted and you are even QUESTIONING if you should kick out your twin brother?????\n\nPhill kicks you out of visiting his house because you didn\u2019t agree with him, and wants to extend his \u201ckicking out\u201d powers to your home. \n\nFind better friends. Seriously.", "Well, that\u2019s a pretty sorry excuse for f@cking around.  Not that there are any excuses that aren\u2019t pretty sorry.  But seriously?  He\u2019s using the grass might be greener excuse.  \n\nYour brother didn\u2019t do anything wrong.  Phil had already wrecked his home.  Not sure how Phil could even keep a straight face while accusing someone of being a home wrecker while he\u2019s standing in the rubble of his own design.  And now he\u2019s all shocked that you chose your brother\u2026who had nothing to do with blowing up Phil\u2019s life?\n\nIt\u2019s ok to be concerned about your friend. It\u2019s not ok for your friend to make your brother the scapegoat for his own shitty choices.", "In my defense, i never cogitated the idea of kicking Adam out, he's my brother and if he's going to live somewhere it's gonna be with me, if he ever wants to move away that's fine but until then he stays with me\n\nPhill admitted that to me, but he also said that was the worst mistake of his life and shit so i thought \"He fucked up but he knows he fucked up and will probably grow from that\" i was wrong but i truly believed in it\n\nYeah, after seeing the responses to this post i should probably do that", "Annie is your best friend, Adam is your brother, sounds like the trash took himself out."]}
