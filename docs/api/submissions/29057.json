Her employer has a very generous maternity leave of 6 months so she still has one more month of full pay remaining before she has to go back. We are currently dual income and the agreement before having a kid was that we would remain a dual income household and she would go back to work after her leave, and we would put our son in a daycare near our home. My friend's kids go there and it seems to be excellent.\n\nDespite the daycare seemingly being a great fit, my partner is having cold feet about going back to work. She wants to put in her two weeks notice upon return and become a SAHM. I really never wanted this situation because the thought of being a sole earner has always been very stressful to me but she really is wanting this. Now my partner's family is mostly back in South America and she has been sending them money on a monthly basis for as long as Ive known her. Anywhere from $500-2k a month. While figuring out if we can make things work on just my income, we are putting together a budget.\n\nI have stated that I will agree to her staying home, but I wont be sending her family income from my paycheck every month or at all. I work overtime most weeks and I refuse to work overtime jsut to send the money out of the country. If Im not going to benefit from the extra work, Id rather just have more time to relax and be with my son. my partner says this is unfair as her family is very important to her and she's saying Im being as AH about it as I should have known that supporting her family would always be part of her life and by having a kid with her I basically signed up for that. AITAH for putting my foot down and refusing to ever send them money if she's not contributing to the household income?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Since people keep bringing the topic up, I am adding that we are not in a state that recognizes Common Law marriage or Palimony, and we are not going to get legally married.** ", "created_utc": 1697488211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179fv2q/aita_for_cutting_support_for_my_partnerss_family/", "score": 3515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son getting to spend time with you is infinitely more valuable and no matter how much you earn, you can never get the time back.\n\nBudgeting is a great idea, but I guarantee your son will blow that out of the water in unexpected ways. Will your health care cover them both if she leaves her job? \nWill she really want to send money to the family if its the choice between that or your son's christmas/birthday gift?\nDoes she know what they spend the money on? Are you doing without to keep a cousin in expensive trainers? Or is she keeping them from the breadline?\nIt's an important nuance, but if it's the latter then she shouldn't be giving up her job if those are the stakes?\n\nThis isn't going to be easy OP, but you're right to challenge her - something doesn't add up and the difference shouldn't come at the expense of your wellbeing or your relationship with your son.", "NTA\n\nYou two had an agreement.

If she has an allowance (and I can tell you the bile in the back of my throat from that term), she can chose to send to her family.  If she leaves you and has child support, she could use that too.  Just saying.\n\nI was fortunate to have a job that allowed me to take a full year off knowing my job would still be there for me.  I was not ready to leave my child with some random childcare worker at 6 months.  Lots of turnover in that industry.  It's much easier to go to work where you control your time and choices vs. having to cater your day to children.  My husband had to spend 2 weeks at home with our child after chicken pox exposure - he had never had chicken pox.  I remember at the end he told me  \"I understand now.  I get to go back to work\".\n\nI hope you find a peaceful resolution.", "I think you're NTA but this is a situation that could easily lean a Y T A depending on how you approach it. If the money isn't there, it just isn't there and there's absolutely nothing wrong with saying something like \"I'm running the numbers and the math just doesn't work out to send money to your family if you stay home.\" But phrasing it as \"if you stay at home I won't be sending money to your family sounds sorta coercive.", "YTA so you want to financially abuse your partner because they\u2019d rather care of you child than send them to strangers.", "She married an American to support her family overseas which is typical for foreigners.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her employer has a very generous maternity leave of 6 months so she still has one more month of full pay remaining before she has to go back. We are currently dual income and the agreement before having a kid was that we would remain a dual income household and she would go back to work after her leave, and we would put our son in a daycare near our home. My friend's kids go there and it seems to be excellent.\n\nDespite the daycare seemingly being a great fit, my partner is having cold feet about going back to work. She wants to put in her two weeks notice upon return and become a SAHM. I really never wanted this situation because the thought of being a sole earner has always been very stressful to me but she really is wanting this. Now my partner's family is mostly back in South America and she has been sending them money on a monthly basis for as long as Ive known her. Anywhere from $500-2k a month. While figuring out if we can make things work on just my income, we are putting together a budget. \n\nI have stated that I will agree to her staying home, but I wont be sending her family income from my paycheck every month or at all. I work overtime most weeks and I refuse to work overtime jsut to send the money out of the country. If Im not going to benefit from the extra work, Id rather just have more time to relax and be with my son. my partner says this is unfair as her family is very important to her and she's saying Im being as AH about it as I should have known that supporting her family would always be part of her life and by having a kid with her I basically signed up for that. AITAH for putting my foot down and refusing to ever send them money if she's not contributing to the household income? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. She can't have it both ways. What she's asking is so unfair! And maybe you did \"sign up\" for agreeing that her family would always get money - just not yours! Can't she realize your young family NEEDS this money?", "NTA \n\nShe changed the agreement and is choosing to stay at home now. Which means whatever she did with her salary goes away and it becomes a situation where you prioritise what you can afford because you\u2019re just living off one income. If she feels that strongly about it then she can go back to work but now you have a child was that still feasible to send so much money to her family? That\u2019s not a long term solution", "NTA. Under no circumstances her family is your obligation! You only to provide for your family who in this case will be her and the baby! My mother was a stay at home mom for 10 years and my father never paid for anyone else outside our household,  so no, by having a kid with her you didn\u2019t sign up to support her family.", "NTA. Does she see you as her husband or as a cash cow?", "Absolutely NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to have it both ways! She can\u2019t be a SAHM and expect you to support the 3 of you fully and send her family money home!! That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous and very selfish in my opinion. No only are you taking on the stress of being a single income home, you\u2019re clearly missing precious time with your own child to afford her to be a SAHM!  \n\nAnd no, you should\u2019ve *expected to fully financially support* her, you\u2019d your child, and her family back him!! \n\nStand firm! Either she goes back to work and *shes* helps her family back home, or she gets to be a SAHM and you\u2019re not sending out *your* hard earned money", "NTA whatsoever", "NTA and she doesn't or shouldn't be able to back out of the deal. And absolutely do not send your hard earned money to her family. She can go back to work. Good luck.", "NTA. \n\nSpending time with your family and your children is very important to you, and she should have known that you wouldn't want to compromise that. Why should you take away time bonding with your child?", "NTA\n\nIt is her choice to work to support her out of country family. This is a hill I would die on as well. Wife works or her family gets nada. \n\nThe only thing you signed up for having a kid with her is child support if you should split. Her family is hers to support, not her partners.", "NTA. That is ridiculous to expect you to support not only her but her family. Either she works and supports them or the support stops and they figure it out. I personally wouldn\u2019t agree to support her. It was not the agreement you at before the child was born and you aren\u2019t married.", "NTA. Her family is not your problem just because yall mixed genetic goo, all that guarantees is that her son is provided for, you have no obligation to support her family or even her. She doesn\u2019t get to use your money anyway she sees fit, but she can use her own money however she wants. That\u2019s the trade off for being a sahm, you no longer get any sort of power financially. Too many women seem to not take that into account.", "NTA. Your wife is being ridiculous. Marrying her does not mean you sign up to take care of her extended family. If she wants to help, do it from her own income. She cannot expect you to take care of her family while she sits at home. Tell her she either go back to work, or no money will be sent to her family or you guys separate.", "NTA, but her attitude makes me think she\u2019s not very trustworthy with a shared account. If she becomes a SAHM, I would have a \u201cYours\u201d \u201cmine\u201d and \u201cours\u201d account so she isn\u2019t lying and taking your money and sending it to her family anyways. Add up how much your bills are and put it in \u201cours\u201d. Calculate what you think is fair to give to \u201cyours\u201d that way there isn\u2019t any financial control or abuse going on, then have a \u201cmine\u201d so you can have your own spending money and savings.", "If she wants to send her family $500 - $2,000 a month, she can work for it.", "NTA. As you stated, in order to be a one income household you\u2019ll have to create and stick to a strict budget. Unfortunately this is something you can no longer afford; if it\u2019s that important to her than you can\u2019t afford to be a one income household and she needs to go back to work.", "NTA.   If she wants to support her family, then she should make the money for that.   If she wants to be a SAHM, maybe she can work weekends or nights to make up for the money difference.   Because it shouldn't be only on you to provide for your family plus hers!", "NTA. You did not sign up for supporting her family by having a kid with her. You aren\u2019t required to support them, even if you were married, if you\u2019re the sole income. She\u2019s trying to guilt trip you so she can have everything she wants\u2014stay at home with you paying for everything and continuing to send money to her family. Most likely I\u2019d imagine if you told her family she\u2019s planning to be a SAHM and they\u2019ll no longer be getting money from her, they\u2019ll end up arguing with her about her selfishness (for their own selfish reasons) and she doesn\u2019t want to deal with that. She has to decide which she wants more\u2014staying at home  with your son or sending money home. \n\nDo you have combined finances? If you haven\u2019t combined them, don\u2019t. If you do I\u2019d look in to separating them again. Especially if she \u201caccidentally\u201d gets laid off shortly after going back.", "NTA. If supporting her family will always be a part of her life, fine- SHE can handle that sort of her life. Given that she has changed her mind about what you had previously agreed on regarding income and being at home, I don\u2019t see why you should also be the one supporting her family. She made the choice to do that, it is HER responsibility to find the money.", "NTA. Ask her how she would like just living on child support if she keeps pushing", "NTA, but it\u2019s also super normal for new moms to be anxious about leaving their infants in care. Six months is so little. Isn\u2019t there a compromise where she could work from home or part time for a while?", "NTA- You don't have an obligation to send her family any money. Your responsibility is with your child, period. I would be careful if I were you, she may go back to work and \"surprisingly\" get fired and fail to get another job and before you know it, you're the sole earner and MAYBE your money will go to South America behind your back.", "NTA   Your partner is expecting you to assume all cost for raising your child because she wants to be a SAHM.   Because I a, sure Your Family is important to YOU, You will need to start now if you want to have funds for K-12 education, health care, sports, transportation, and all the extras she will want:  birthdays, holiday celebrations, etc etc etc.  Any money you might have dedicated to going south now needs to go into the Bank", "I don't think that setting boundaries where she has a choice is an AH move, especially because you had conversations about what your life looked like with a baby and she is the one trying to change that agreement. She can't demand to decrease your income and expect to keep expenses the same. Why should your quality of life have to suffer for her family to be getting quite that much money from you? I think she's being rather ridiculous to expect to get everything that she wants, especially if it requires you to then be working overtime to afford to provide for her family. NTA", "Its her family, not yours, and you're not even married.  If she wants to work to send them money then she can do so, but taking your labor and sending it to them while she lives a life of relative leisure sounds incredibly unfair.  \n\nWhy doesn't she work so you can be a stay at home dad?  I think her reaction to this scenario would show how unfair and unequal the proposal is.\n\nIf you did agree to this you'd resent it and it would spell the end of your relationship at some point in the future.  I'd ask her if she cares about your own quality of life and supports you, it seems like she is just using you.\n\nI wouldn't say any of this to her in the verbage I am saying it.  Dealing with this situation is going to take diplomacy, and talking through having her see things from your point of view in a non confrontational way.  I am only sharing all this so you have the tools you need to set healthy boundaries for yourself and the situation.\n\nCongratulations on being a parent and I hope that once you overcome this hurdle you have a great future.  :)", "NTA, make sure you have all of your paycheck going into an account that only you can access.

However, being a first time, it is terrifying to place the life of your baby into, essentially, a strangers hands.  There are so many horror stories about daycares having \u201cfight clubs\u201d or leaving a child alone after hours, it becomes an endless cycle of anxiety running in her head while she is alone at home with the infant. Before getting  frustrated that she is changing her mind about the dual income agreement, maybe have a conversation about why she has decided to all of a sudden want to be a SAHM. She could also be dealing with PPD or separation anxiety.", "NTA\n\nShe cannot have it both ways.  Either she works and money gets sent to her family, or she does not work, and money does not get sent.", "NTA. has your wife forgotten that your son is *also* part of her family? that's no small amount of money she's sending to her family each month, and unless you were earning quite a large income i can't see how still sending so much wouldn't impact your household, and thus your son, fairly significantly.", "NTA", "NTA. Her priority now, should be her child. Not her family in South America. The money she is sending them could help pay for your child's future. Kids are expensive.

Of course they're married. Lived together for years, he's a guild member and used her to show that he was married and eligible to set up his own business, she's got kids who call him \"dad\" and they all lived  together for the past ten years, at least, if not longer.\" \n\nOr, alternately, \"Those two?  They've hated each other for years!  Never saw them interact in public with anything more than basic courtesy, I never knew them to live together or run a business together.  Couldn't possibly be married acting like that!\"\n\nYou see elements of these things in modern legal marriages.  Witnesses are now required. But it still is necessary for each partner to say \"I take you as my husband/wife,\"  And the exchange of tokens if often (but not always) wedding bands, but the practice of feeding each other cake enacts another way in which a token could be exchanged, giving each other a piece of bread or cake to eat.\n\nStatutory laws, however, have always trumped things that were established by judges under common law. This applies to all areas of the law, not just marriages. \n\nIn the US, most states have eliminated common law by statute.  That isn't a \"get out of jail free\" card if you are in a relationship, however.  Particularly if you have kids, or if as a couple you have accumulated significant property during your time together. \n\nYou would need to consult an attorney familiar with family law in your jurisdiction to know the actual obligations involved in ending a long-term relationship, particularly with kids.  Reddit comments do not count as expert legal advice, even if written by a lawyer. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn OP's case, there is a child involved, so she could ask for a DNA test to establish paternity, and get child support.  If it can be shown they ran a business together, joint ownership might be inferred, even if only one had their name on it, if you can show the other invested time and money.  Likewise for any properties bought during their relationship.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBut in this situation, the solution isn't an ultimatum.  Many, many parents are hesitant to start leaving their baby in the care of others.  The thing to do is focus on a smooth transition.  Short stays with a babysitter while the couple goes for a coffee nearby, gradually working up to longer periods of time.  \n\n*\"I don't care that you're the mother of my child, and went through nine months of pregnancy, the ordeal of labor and delivery or a C-section, and risked your life and health for this child.  You need to leave the child with someone else and start earning money, if you don't want your parents to starve, including your mother who went through the same ordeal for you to be born\"* is not a good look, or part of any healthy and positive relationship.\n\nOP needs to manage this situation with humanity, kindness, and consideration, if there is any hope of this relationship lasting.  And if OP sticks by the ultimatum, and the relationship ends, knowing he chose this course of action with a previous partner, the mother of his child, will be a red flag to anyone considering him as a potential romantic partner.\n\nSomeone who values love and caring is going to be turned off by someone who makes the process of having a child together so transactional. \n\nSuch an ultimatum is within OP's legal rights, but the consequences will not be limited to acceptance of the concept that having the legal right to do something a certain way is all that matters in being a decent human being.", "Daycare isn't right for every family, but it's not bad for the baby.

Particularly the weeks leading up to going back. The baby still feels very little, often still breastfeeding a lot etc.    \n       \nBut after a couple of months I was totally fine with it. Not because I somehow became hardened to wanting to protect my child, but because it\u2019s the transition that is more hard than the actual situation of working.        \n      \nWhat also helped was eventually going part time - it might be OPs wife is more ok with a situation where she is only working say half the week.

I\u2019ve heard of these babies/toddlers that are OK playing around nicely for a couple of hours while you do a bit of work, but\u2026 mine is not one of those children. I have to bring work home a bit and I basically have to do it after 8pm because it\u2019s just not happening when she is awake and she stopped napping. Plus it means you are essentially having to do two types of work at once (childcare/domestic and some other type) which is a huge load rather than a balance.

He just closes to have nothing.", "Please sit her down and let her know..she has a certain amount of time to think this through and make a decision, she works and supports her family, or she stays home and her family does not receive support. Thats not fair on you.", "Completely agree with you.", "YOUR money goes to YOUR family - your son and your partner. HER family can only claim HER money.  Good luck, OP - make sure she can't access your account if she cannot agree to this simple truth and draw the necessary consequences, (which are to go back to work). Absolutely NTA!", "I hope she realizes this ask is not reasonable or responsible unless she keeps her income. \n\nSadly at this point, it sounds like she may resent you if she has to keep working. If not, she may resent you because her family will start piling on the guilt. \n\nHopefully she understands its not on you to support her family. Otherwise the best option might be to separate.", "You had a child with someone without understanding the socioeconomic ramifications of tying your life with this person. That was your mistake #1. It doesn't matter that you aren't married to her. If she's a SAHM, your paycheck is *also her* paycheck. So no, it's not coming from your paycheck, it's coming from hers; it just so happens it's the same bucket. She's taking care of the child and the house so you can work. If you don't like that arrangement tell her you won't agree to her being a SAHM.", "Tbh I was on your side until this comment. In your partner\u2019s eyes it\u2019s likely that sending money to her parents is a non negotiable, sending a set amount to just her parents could be a compromise for her not working. \n\nBut really why this comment rubs me to a YTA - If she becomes a sahm it won\u2019t be your money, it will be the family\u2019s money, and the family decides what to do with their money. Unilateral control of \u201cmy money\u201d is a crummy power play seen in a lot of single earner relationships. If you\u2019re not ready for \u201cfamily money\u201d then you\u2019re not ready for her to be a sahm and you should curb the conversation today.", "This makes sense except six months is way too early to go back to work after having a baby in most of the world. Most places have a year or more of maternity leave, and anything less is barbaric. For the next year or two you should consider your paycheck to be your family's money, because you're still able to go to work and you'll have built-in childcare available to you. You may consider childcare entirely her responsibility, but it's also yours and it's your problem too if you have to stay home from work because baby is sick and can't go to daycare. If your wife stays home, you basically don't even have to miss a day because SAHMs don't get time off or sick days, or even lunch off duty, and also no pay. Now I agree supporting her family is ridiculous, but while the baby's too young to be separated from his mother, I think you should at least divide the disposable income in the paycheque between you two to do with as you both please. She deserves some of her own spending money too, and she should have access to family money (after bills) same as you. She's sacrificing a lot to stay home, too. Like her independence. Don't make her ask for an allowance.", "> Yep. \"filial duty\" exists basically a everywhere BUT the US (and possible western Europe but idk)\n\nExcept, even in those countries, filial duty doesn't extend to financially supporting your in-laws and their extended family.", "Basically almost every culture except White/Western.  It's not really country dependent - ask me how I know.", "Filial duty is an actual legal responsibility in over half of US states.\n\nhttps://www.harborlifesettlements.com/4-ways-filial-responsibility-laws-can-affect-you/", "Why not put it in a, oh I don't know, bank? You can bet that money is being used not saved.", "There might be nothing anyone can do if he doesn\u2019t send support.", "That comes across a little misleading. While an employer could intentionally pick a plan with an insurance provider that doesn't offer domestic partner coverage, it really doesn't have anything to do with whether your employer recognizes your partnership or not. If the insurance provider offers domestic partner coverage, the employer has no say in whether or not their employee uses it.", "Yes! When my partner lost his job in 2020, I was able to add him to my plan. We didn't even have to wait for open enrollment, as the loss of a job is considered a qualifying event to immediately update your plan. A year or so later, I switched to his insurance through his new employer because the coverage was so much better. But even back in 2007-ish I was able to add my then-boyfriend to my plan before he qualified for his own coverage.", "Yeah looking at other comments I was in one of those eight states when I was common law with my now official husband when he added me to his insurance. His HR at the time warned us that we could be legally recognized as common law. It really depends on the laws in OPs area. He should definitely check into it just in case.", "My point is that OP should check into the laws in their area so not really moot. There are some very tricky laws out there and only a lawyer can tell him if he\u2019s heading into financial trouble letting her become a SAHM. Right now she wants to send part of his paycheck to her family, what will she ask for next and what would she be legally entitled to? When someone starts financially supporting another person things can get tricky should they break up. He\u2019d do good to just make sure to do his research.", "OP has but gf is pushing back and complaining about it.", "I wish it was only my own mother I witnessed this sort of behavior in. \n\nSadly it is far too common in the stay at homes of my coworkers as well. A couple had to start paying nannys because their stay at homes were getting CPS called on them for neglecting the kids/ leaving under 8s at home alone.  Birthing a child does not automatically make a person into a good parent even if they are gifted with all the time they need to take care of them.  \n\nI am sorry to hear about your mom. Parkinson's is a perfectly legitimate reason to stay home though raising kids at the same time must have been rough for her."]}
