Me and my friends went on vacation the same time she and my parents were going on vacation. Because of this we had to make sure our dogs would be taken care of. I had someone at the house watching them and even had asked another friend to come in check on them if needed while we were gone. But my sister wanted to put her youngest in a kennel for the week she was gone, which is fine if that\u2019s what she wanted to do. However, as we were on our vacations there was an outbreak of a kennel related disease at that pet resort she had put her puppy in and had told her of the outbreak. She didn\u2019t tell me that her dog had been exposed until she brought him back to my house and had already let him be around the other dogs for hours and when he was starting to show symptoms. I had no idea that he had been exposed cause she never told me prior and I didn\u2019t accompany her to pick him up so I wasn\u2019t present for information being told of the outbreak. When she told me I was furious cause she neglected to inform me before she brought him back in my house and I am also am falling on hard times and that vet bill would be hard to pay at the moment. When I confronted her about it she said none of it was her fault and that my possible sick dogs were basically my problem not hers. My biggest issue is her not wanting accept that it was irresponsible to big him home and not a least let me know so we could figure something out while he was sick so the others wouldn\u2019t get sick. I also have an issue that she is denying she had some responsibility in my dogs getting exposed. And lastly not even being remorseful for her actions and not even at least saying sorry for this mistake. I know the outbreak at the kennel was not her fault but the lack communication and neglect of the other dogs well being was.", "created_utc": 1688449047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14q63l0/aita_for_wanting_my_sister_to_pay_the_vet_bill_if/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
