We have been friends since middle school and there's been lots of disagreements between us, but not one as serious as this. Adam was moving for his trade school and it was a 7 hour drive from where we live currently, and his dad was going to drive him. He had everything planned, but all of a sudden he hears that his dad may have cancer and needed to have an emergency surgery, meaning he wouldn't be able to drive him anymore. Being his best friend, he asked me to drive in his dad's place. I was open to the idea since this city is somewhere I always wanted to go anyways, so I agreed on the spot.\n\nFast forward a couple days later, I wanted to talk details with Adam to see how everything would plan out. I'm currently in a trade school online, and as embarrassing as it is to admit, I really didn't have the funds to drive 14 hours total while covering expenses like food, and housing. Adam knew I didn't have that kind of money, and he did offer to pay for gas the way there, which was a given for me. Like I said before, I've never been to this city before, nor have I driven that far in my life. After giving it some more thought, I had composed a text asking politely if his dad could pay for the minimum expenses like housing for 1 night, and my gas. I wasn't asking for a 5 star hotel, I just wanted somewhere to rest up and leave the next morning because I didn't feel comfortable driving that much in one day. To my surprise, he didn't take that text very well and started calling me entitled for asking that. He said that he didn't want to ask his dad for money since his family was in distress due to the possibility he might have cancer, and that his dad's friend offered to do it for free beforehand.\n\nBefore I go on, I want to mention that Adam's family was more than well off, and Adam had just received around 6,000 dollars as spending money from his dad, he's on his dad's credit card, meaning he really didn't NEED to ask for that money in the first place. He gets refills all the time.\n\nBack to the story! After reading his response, I immediately told him that he should have his dad's friend drive him there because it would be easier on both sides. I thought that was the end of it but he proceeded to try and guilt trip me saying things like \"I thought you were my bestfriend\" and \"I thought I could count on you for this\". Which really made me mad. We had always been great friends and were often selfless towards one another, but this situation put me in a tough spot. Hearing that really left a big impression, and I didn't want to be friends with Adam anymore.\n\nAround 2 weeks after this happened, Adam\u2019s other close friend, who we\u2019ll call Bob, asked me to hangout and play tennis. I found the text weird considering we also haven\u2019t spoken ever since Adam and I stopped talking.

He's just gotten a ton of money so could afford to pay for your expenses and asking for a nights accom so that you can drive safely is not a big ask. \n\nStick to your guns. If you aren't comfortable making the journey without a stop over for a sleep then don't do it. It's hard enough doing big drives to places you haven't been before without the stress of driving long distances without sleep. That causes accidents. It's just not worth your life.", "NTA. You don\u2019t ask for your friends to cover your expenses and give up a significant amount of their time just because you\u2019re kind of stressed out. \u201cAdam\u201d seems very entitled and I think maybe you should make new friends unless he genuinely apologizes and changes his attitude.", "Honestly you were NTA as soon as I hit \u201cdrive 14 hours in one day\u201d especially on short notice. It\u2019s the sort of thing you can always ask someone in case they love driving and want to visit the locale, etc., but definitely not something you would take for granted that of course they\u2019d do it if they\u2019re your friend. That is WAY above and beyond.", "NTA\n\nWith that sort of money, he could probably pay to have his stuff transported. \n\nWhat exactly was it that you were expected to do?  Transport some stuff in your car and help him carry it in.\n\nCould've just hired a small truck and mover to do that and some places have depots in different cities and you wouldn't even have to drive it back.", "I love to drive, I do it a lot, both day trips and longer road trips, and I don\u2019t recall ever in my life driving 14 hours in a day.  That\u2019s brutal.  NTA", "NTA and find a new friend. Anyone who is entitled is better left alone. If he can drive why did he want someone else to take up the job. Also you don't have to go to great lengths for friends, just keep within reasonable means. Would it have been the same if the shoe was on the other foot? Looks like people just want to take advantage of the situation and do the emotional blackmail when it suits them. Better to move on as you won't get much out of that friendship.", "NTA, it is a 14 hour drive to and back and that\u2019s already a lot. And you tried to talk it out with Adam about costs, at the end of the day it\u2019s your choice on whether you want to or not since it\u2019s on your time.", "Definitely NTA! I would never ask any of my friends to do that without making sure they are well compensated, especially if I had that kind of money. I don\u2019t think \u201cAdam\u201d is mature if he can\u2019t see how this impacts you. Also, I don\u2019t agree with the comment that says YTA for agreeing right away. If my friend came to me, in the middle of their move, and said their parent may have cancer, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to think clearly and just said yes to be there for them. So I get why you\u2019d say yes.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA.

I couldn't comfortably so this in a day.", "My \"old\" best friend from school tried to pull the same recently. Her dad was undergoing treatment for cancer. Her family is wealthy (planning to open a hospital soon). Sher doesn't earn much by choice. And she demanded a few thousand dollars, demanded my bank account balance, etc. while keeping it a secret.\n\nI have sympathy. But I had asked for time since that much money was a lot and I had just started working. Moreover, I don't trust her with money. Because of se incidents. Now after two months she says her dad is fine.\n\nNTA", "What kind of question is this? Why would any jurisdiction, whether local, state, or federal even create a law about the length of time you're allowed to drive without sleep? I can see it for people who drive for a living (long haul truckers), but why would you even assume any law such as this would a) exist, or b) be applicable here, or c) be enforceable?", "There are laws for professionals regarding breaks between shifts in Australia, so a truck driver is restricted to how long they can drive before they must have at least an 8hr break. \n\n\nYou are correct in that it would be impossible to enforce on a non professional. Additionally, I have on more than one occasion done a long drive (sadly it's more than 14 hrs from my house to my parents) and it comes down to individual skill sets and comfort behind the wheel.\n\n\nOP you're NTA. It's commendable that you know your own limits and drive safely - it reassures me to know there are people like you on the road!", "NTA. If I was gonna ask my friend to drive 14 hours and help me move, not only would I be paying for their gas, I would wine and dine them to thank the, for their sacrifice", "NTA. When my dad\u2019s best friend moved states, they had to drive due to all the furniture. My dad\u2019s best friend paid for everything: gas, food, board, etc. It\u2019s only right to offset the cost if you\u2019re asking someone to do a huge favor", "I once drove 5 hours one way and 6 hours back in the same day. \n\nDecided I would never do that again. \n\n14 hours? No way. \n\nI also noticed that the friend only offered OP gas for one way, why not both? Like \"I'll pay fur the first of getting me and my stuff where I need to be,  but getting back again is on you\""]}
