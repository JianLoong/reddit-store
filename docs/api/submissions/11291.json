This would be a local court small claims suit, which people can bring without lawyers. Exhibit number one would be your EX's admission of fault and promise to (have you) pay for the shoes. You can wait it out and hope that the other parent might do nothing. They might also sue you since $700 isn't that small of an amount. If you don't want that possitbility hanging over you, I would suggest asking the other parent for proof/receipts (evidence shoes destroyed, evidence that the shoes cost actually $700 to buy or replace, and more info on the circumstances, e.g., did your kid purposefully destroy the shoes). I would then consider offering to pay some amount (not the full $700).

They can get stains out of anything from silk to leather, so I'm sure getting mudd off sneakers would be completely doable.

The chances of them getting dirty in that environment is very high by either someone else or their own child themself.  I would rule in favor of having them cleaned, but wouldn't award that much money.  At the end of the day it is the dirty shoe, not what brand of shoe you chose to wear.
