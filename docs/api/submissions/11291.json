You didn't agree to pay for them ahead of time, why was her son wearing them to school? These are pretty poor excuses.\n\nI agree with the boy's father that you two should set a good example for him. That is why he shouldn't be signing you, or anyone that isn't himself up for paying for something that you didn't agree to. If he really thinks they should be paid for, how excellent it is that he is the one who promised to pay for them! And if you believe that it is more moral not to pay it, then that is the better example to set. I'm sure there was enough of a fuss to make your son feel bad for stepping on someone else's shoe.\n\nBut too often adults will try to take advantage of the fact that something was caused by a child, or seemed to be caused by a child, to try and get paid for it. I would sit my son down and explain this, before letting him know that accidents happen.

If she remains adamant that you should buy the shoes, ask her how she intends to give them to you and if they are the same size as your son.

Next, in what universe is getting a bit of mud on a shoe destroying them to the state of needing replacement vs say cleaning them like a normal shoe!  If they're that delicate and you want to keep them 'mint' then don't wear them.  Stepping on someone's foot accidentally unfortunate, maybe you could be on the hook for a rag and some cleaner/polish if it needs specialist supplies to clean.
