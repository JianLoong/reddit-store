Even if they were custom orthopedic shoes, they would be able to withstand mud and dirt.", "It couldn't be done by accident. So the question is are they really destroyed and was it done on purpose.", "Apparently the shoes are made of gold tissue paper. That's the only explanation that would make any sense, and even that doesn't make any sense.", "OPs kid can clean one, shoe kid can clean the other to learn how to fix shoes getting dirty, why you don\u2019t wear $700 shoes to school, life isn\u2019t always fair, and other important life lessons", "There are white sneakers that if you get mud on them, will forever be grey. I learned this the hard way", "i am expecting cinderella's glass slipper here, no less.", "I also imagine Ex- didn't particularly care. His plan was to look good to the other parent by saying of course we'll handle it and than say it's OP's responsibility.", "No, this is crazy.  If I walk around crowded areas in a robe made of glass that shatters upon contact with people, I can't then demand those people pay me for my reckless decision making.", "Fine, grant them the $700 shoes. Parents are legally obligated to pay for damages caused by minor children because they're legally responsible for said children. But the parents are divorced, and it happened during Dad's custody time, so Dad was the responsible parent of the minor at the time, so Dad pays.", "No, then the son should pay, but as a minor, custodial parent at the time is the one who has to cover it, aka Dad.", "kid was wearing ben and jerry\u2019s dunks", "People who can afford to get their kids $700 shoes can usually easily afford to replace them if there's damage tbh. My guess is the other family paid that much for these shoes for their teenager and now can't afford to replace them.", "Which is why I would want to know (and OP needs to confirm) the price now. Were they $700 at purchase, or $700 resale value", ">Surf's up!", "For that price, they better do my laundry", "This smells like a hustle to me, mom gets them cleaned after she gets the second pair and flips them for a profit.", "I feel like vomit is slightly different from stepping on shoes once.  Like if someone opens a door into my car I'm going to be like, eh, that's life.  If someone poops on it, I'd be upset.  But you've got to be able to tolerate standard wear and tear if you take things into the world.", "A professional cleaning of them? Sure. The cost of replacing them? Definitely not. Who puts their kid in $700 shoes?", "You don\u2019t have to agree but case law has proven that when people destroy items accidentally or on purpose, the destroyer has to pay.", "We are not disagreeing. She was wrong for how she approached the mom. That\u2019s why ESH. The dad was wrong too.", "Yes. You are right. If it was intentional the father should pay. If it was an accident the kids parents should buy him 14 pairs of $50 shoes and then this wouldn't be a problem.", "those are wayyyy more than $700 these days (DS only though)", "They are pulling the \"I'm rich enough to buy $700 shoes and am therefore better than you\" card.", "Exactly", "Maybe the mom is in cahoots with the ex to get OP to pay back child support money.\n\nI wonder what would happen if OP asked for a receipt for the shoes.", "I own lots of shoes that I could sell right now for over $700 - it's not that they cost that to begin with, it's that they're limited or sneakerheads want them so the resale price goes up high", "I have shoes worth $500+, Louboutins,  Jimmy Choo, and some Stuart Weitzmans. I can afford it, and get joy out of wearing them so why not? \n\nI think spending multiple thousands of dollars on a computer and gaming setup is stupid, but I don't begrudge gamers who do.  I in turn choose to spend my money on shoes and jewellery.\n\nNow I think it's dumb AF to send a kid to school in expensive shoes, but as an adult with a good income, who is meeting all her savings goals? Meh.", "In most cases that's probably reasonable, but not in every situation.  If I board a busy subway with a glass ornament in my breast pocket I can't force someone to repay me when they accidentally break it.  I willingly entered the situation where it could get accidentally damaged.\n\nThis is basically insurance fraud.", "They're pulling the \"these $700 shoes for my teenager were a bit of a financial strain/a really special gift that I can't afford to buy again\" card lol.", "That's possible, it's super fugazi to be sure.", "If you say so.", "Oooh.  But still, THAT'S A LOT OF CASH MONEY."]}
