That means that you respect his time. Do you do things whenever he snaps his fingers? Or do YOU decide when you take out the trash, or vacuum? I know I do. I can be lazy for an hour and then get up and do chores. To be interrupted at any moment for things that are not time sensitive is super annoying.

So maybe he has the $$ to pay (hopefully heavily discounted) rent to his mom, but not market rent, at the moment. Though hopefully if that is the case he's saving money away to GTFO as soon as possible so that he can get away from OP and probably go NC.", "The only example ive seen that I agree with (and heavily consider doing when the time comes) is to charge them a way below market rent (like $200-250), but put all that money into an account for them, and give it to them when the time comes for them to move out. They learn the habit of paying rent, while also unknowingly building a safety nest for when they actually move out.", "I had a lot of trouble with a parent like this in spring of 2021. I was covering for a teacher on medical leave and taught online for four months. One kid's mom figured that since he's home he had to be ready to drop everything at any second. Didn't matter how minuscule the task was, didn't matter how important the class was. There's a science presentation? Too bad, she'd say he needs to fold this laundry immediately. It was a nightmare.", "For one school year I stayed with just my stepdad. I had to do dishes every night. One night I wanted to wait and go hang out with friends. I asked and he was good with it. And I kept my part by doing it as soon as I got back. That\u2019s how it should be.", "And that\u2019s it. OP is a effectively a roommate. But is still going for that mom authority. Nope. Pick one.", "Get her a therapist that specializes in ADHD. They will work on techniques for remembering, as well as helping your teenager know that the parents aren't being jerks need answers. My son has ADHD, started this a few months ago. Had worked wonders on grades at school as well as our relationships. Good luck", "Cause this chain is the top one but no one's put the verdict we're all thinking: OP, you are YTA.", "This would be the only way I'd agree with also.", "I raised four kids and that\u2019s how I did it too. If time is of the essence, then say so. If it\u2019s not, as long as the chore gets done then who cares when it gets done. If we\u2019re all working towards the same goal (like we\u2019re leaving in an hour to go out as a family) then everybody has to pull their weight. Nobody pays rent but they are expected to contribute or leave and make the rules in your own home. I\u2019d be ok with that. Some of them are old enough.", "Ah you\u2019ve met my mother. My sympathies.", "Read many stories like that lol.", "Mine too", "I have 4 too, and I've learned to pick my battles with them!"]}
