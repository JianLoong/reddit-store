YTA", "Maybe, but also some people just don't care! Some people are happy no matter what size they are and they don't try to be a smaller size, they don't want to be a smaller size... Saying lack of discipline implies that everybody wants to be a certain size and if you're not it's a problem with you. That's kinda messed up.", "Same! As soon as I read that, I thought, \u201cAbsolutely! YTA.\u201d Not all fat people are fat because of a lack of discipline. It can be so many other things. I do understand this guy\u2019s frustration but the way he handled it and the way he\u2019s told the story make me think he\u2019s definitely an asshole.", "Happened to me on Qatar Airlines.", "Yeah, I'm not really buying the comments that say it's an international thing, no one is given any specifics", "Yeah, I have flown some of the budget airlines in Europe and the legroom is the worst I\u2019ve experienced.

About 2 hours into the journey bus stopped to pick up more passengers. I was asleep.
