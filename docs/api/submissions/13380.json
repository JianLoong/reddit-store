And even then, you could have asked respectfully.", "I don't care enough either way \ud83e\udd23 YTA", "But it's not in the airlines policy to pay for two seats so that is not a consequence of the fat person's actions. If that WAS the policy then sure, but it's not so you can't say it's a consequence just because you feel like it should be.\n\nIf you fire someone from a job because you \"don't like fat people\" then they will win a discrimination lawsuit against you as it is a legal category of discrimination.", "You can\u2019t change seats if the flight is full\u2026", "Look child, there is a big difference between crew having to let someone off because there isn't sufficient space and banning them from the airline. By your own admission you were getting glared at by other passengers and on this very thread (which is a story told exclusively from your point of view) you are getting downvoted into the ground. \n\nI think it's time you recognise that you managed the situation poorly. What's the possibility that you are right and everyone else is wrong?", "For one there is some time between the rush of passengers coming on and taking off (e.g. last stragglers, luggage put overhead, demonstrations, announcements). I've always seen other people talk to flight attendants at that point.\n\nSecondly I don't think it's such a big deal. I mean, I don't demand to sit away from kids, people who stink, are chatty, are noisy, want the window open, fling their elbows all over the place, touch my leg because they're tall etc. Even though the latter is fucking terrible. What are they gonna do, saw off his legs?", "I don't hate it, I just had a really bad day at work yesterday and don't feel like debating at this point in time. Again, hope you have a great day \ud83d\ude0a", "Don\u2019t the rules say this isn\u2019t a debate sub?", "Well then, you had no freaking business to be an asshole to him.  YTA. You had no more, perhaps less right to it than him, but because he\u2019s fat, you just took a shot. Screw you.", "Did you speak NEAR the man? Because that's actually worse.", "And how are you more entitled to it than him?", "He did too. Your claim is against airline. He did everything right. Perhaps you did too, but for being a prick who took a shot at someone who did not wrong. YTA.", "Did you see his boarding pass with this seat number on it?", "Air Canada is frequently overbooked. Or was. Discount ones are overbooked more frequently for obvious reasons.", "It really doesn\u2019t. Fat acceptance has been a joke from day one. I understand why someone is fat. I\u2019ve been fat too once upon a time. What you don\u2019t do is tell them their unhealthy lifestyle is okay, especially when it\u2019s rooted in mental issues. That\u2019s like telling a heroin addict to keep jabbing up! And that anyone who objects to it is addictphobic!\n\nObesity is an issue. It should not be normalised.", "Not exactly a fair comparison when mine was judged first.", "So now I can\u2019t even accurately describe a person. I didn\u2019t say \u201cthis man\u2019s lard is covering my seat.\u201d I didn\u2019t say it to his face. I said it in regards to how bad the airline service is that they have me and a man\u2019s rolls on the same seat instead of doing the right thing and have better booking systems.", "OP said the man did pay for both seats though.\n\nMaybe in the US it is a legal category, since obese individuals unfortunately make up a huge chunk of the population there. However this isn\u2019t what the topic is about.\n\nAlso no one doesn\u2019t hire obese people because they hate them. I can\u2019t hire an obese person to do heavy lifting for hours on end. That\u2019s a hazard. And that\u2019s usually the case for employment \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d Because obese people are rightfully denied physically high intensity jobs.", "If they're kicking him off of the flight then it doesn't matter if its full or not anyway.", "But why do you think it's ok to not get what you paid for, if you ordered a cake and the size that was delivered was smaller you'd definitely complain. \n\nSo let's say I wait and the attendance has already had someone ask something similar and now there's no other suitable seat left.", "Read the rule lol. Do you read anything?  \nThis subreddit is still about discussion/debate.", "No, I told the flight attendant that my seat was half occupied.", "Well, mostly because I didn\u2019t know he paid for it until after this whole incident.", "Spoken with all the hauteur of the formerly fat.", "The normal thing to say would be \"this man is taking up part of my seat.\" Or just ask if there are any other seats.", "Are you just socially unaware or have you been coddled your whole life or something? In what world do you think you can treat the people around you like shit and expect to get what you want?   \nI've been in your position before and I asked the flight attendant:  \n\"Hey, is the plane pretty full today or are there some seats available elsewhere?\" and the flight attendant said there were some empty rows near the back I can move to once the plane takes off if I can just stay where I am right now for weight and balance. I responded with \"thank you\" and  that was it.  \nMaybe if you knew how to be a mature adult then you would have gotten your way instead of throwing a tantrum and expecting it to work.", "You could have said that there isn't enough  room and you would like to change seats. That's a fact without being an AH", "Didn't talk about safety issues or hazardous environments but I knew you'd bring it up lol. Obviously some jobs will have height/weight requirements due to safety issues... there is a height requirement to be a flight attendant for example.\n\nYour issue is that you don't actually read what people are saying and just continue spouting your views. On the topic of poor reading comprehension, OP said that the other passenger paid for the seat they were sitting in, not for two seats. Why would there be an issue if the other passenger paid for two seats... do you really think there is a person out there who is taking up three airplane seats???", "People discriminate against fat people all the time lol. They certainly are hired less often than thin/normal weight people.", "Read the final sentence of the second paragraph. Then rethink that comment you said to me about my reading comprehension.", "The size of plane seats, leg room, etc does vary. You are paying for the travel so I would not consider my money \"stolen\" lol.\n\nIf a flight is overbooked, they tend to offer you money or vouchers to go to another flight. Doesn't seem like it's ever happened to you", "You literally said that OP doesn\u2019t know if the flight is full WHEN HE LITERALLY SAID IT. You don\u2019t get to lecture me about my reading comprehension. Hit the gym.", "And did it while insulting the passenger who also paid for the seat.  YTA. This could have been discussed in your original post, but you decided you wanted to make sure to get licks in at overweight person & get sympathy even thoug issue is same that they sold seat twice & you had no more right than person next to you regardless.", "So you weren\u2019t more entitled to the seat, just more entitled in attitude and were an ass. Got it. YTA.", "Hey, by all means live in your delusion that you\u2019re healthy. I did too.", "But the other guy paid for the seat as well. Airline double booked apparently, but because he was fat OP took a free shot. He didn\u2019t mention that in original post.  Wonder why\u2026\u2026.", "Good that I said that originally, then.", "I wonder if there is a solution to that problem \ud83e\udd14", "Oh the second seat you said the other passenger paid for? Gotcha.", "I've been lucky when flying, I've never had an issue. Apart from flying with Virgin and that was more the shit service.", "You said \"rolls\"", "Yeah, not being discriminatory!\n\nSince I know exactly what you mean, go ahead and tell me how to lose weight step by step. I know how. Do you?", "Thus making the flight full, over booked in fact, because 300 seats (example) are being used, but 301 were purchased. Good job little bro.", "About to go with Ryanair... Wish me luck", "Are they not rolls?", "Hmm but I did tell you that already.", "Well because I had the added discipline of exercise, eating 2400 calories with as much protein as possible really helps. Ditching the car ride for a walk too. Not a single bit of intense cardio was done. Lost 23 kg. And that\u2019s just total weight, I\u2019m sure I lost around 30 kg in fat, but I\u2019ve been training with weight lifting.", "I've never had an issue with them, but I do know when you do have issues they are a nightmare.
