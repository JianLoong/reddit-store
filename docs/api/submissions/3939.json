I am just not sure if you know what the issue is and trying to play innocent here or if this is really out of the blue. Either way I say NTA because your fault or not, there is no reason to be around someone who does not like you and the same applies if you don't like him.", "Here\u2019s the deal. You are not obligated to attend the wedding. You don\u2019t even need an excuse. Just respond \u201cno\u201d if there\u2019s an RSVP and move on. NTA.", "NTA.  Cousin is obviously an asshole.  What's the point of going to the wedding of an asshole?", "NTA A wedding invite is not a summons.  It is ok to avoid events you don\u2019t want to go to.", "NTA. Don\u2019t go.", "NTA- not going is just avoiding buying into their drama and avoids giving them the satisfaction of cutting you out\u2026", "NTA at all. \n\nYour cousin clearly couldn't be bothered to care about you, and you definitely aren't obliged to attend someone's wedding. Sure, it's polite, but if he's not giving you any respect or courtesy then he shouldn't expect any back.", "NTA. He's trying to turn you into the problem instead of him", "NAH. You're not obligated to go to the wedding just because you're related.

I\u2019ve just looked at your post history. \n\nHave you ever had an autism diagnosis?", "NTA It sounds like he failed to communicate why he left you out. Distance isn't a good enough reason. Because it is your decision to say to him, I'm sorry but the distance is too far, not for him to decide for you, without discussing it. Because he failed to talk open and honestly, you have ended up feeling unwanted, hurt, excluded and isolated, so you cannot be blamed here for deciding not to go.", "NTA\n\nI doubt this is the first incident with this cousin. Don't go where you are not wanted.", "NTA And your cousin was a d bag! He singled you out. He can take a walk\u2026", "I\u2019m getting downvoted here, but NAH. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely entitled to be upset by not being in the wedding party and it\u2019s your prerogative not to attend. \nThat said, it\u2019s his wedding and the day is about him and his partner\u2026 they get to choose who\u2019s in his wedding party \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fIt\u2019s a bit rubbish about the baseball though.", "NTA for not going to the wedding, but have you maintained a relationship with this cousin? There has to be a reason you are not in the wedding party.", "nTA. He doesn't care about your presence so why give it to him?", "NTA\n\n\nYou don't have to go to someone's wedding just because they invite you.", "NTA. He made it clear that he doesn\u2019t consider you close so you have no obligation to go out of your way for him- after all, you live two hours away, attending his wedding would be too difficult for you \ud83d\ude01. \n\nHe is just desperate to not come out of this looking like he did anything wrong and because he actually knows he looks rude he has to make YOU look rude\u2026 ignore all of this and let him flounder.", "NTA\n\nDo not justify or respond to anything, just send your invite back as \"no\" and move on. You have every right not to go, and he put you in a very awkward position of essentially being the only cousin without a role, which will be obvious to your family at the wedding. He obviously either has an issue or just doesn't care, and that's fine, but I'd say just match his energy and avoid discussing it beyond saying you can't attend", "NTA, sounds like he's mad cuz he can't rub it in your face in person at his wedding", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is fine not to have you in a special role and just invite you as a guest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine not to go.

It\u2019s also you right to not go to a wedding if you feel uncomfortable, left out, etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is a hard AH here. The bride and groom get to choose their wedding party and you can choose not to come. \n\n*But also we need more information here- You never know, it may not be from him could be from his wife.

Your cousin is probably an asshole in general, but he's entitled to choose who is in his wedding party so in this context he isn't wrong. In exactly the same way, you are entitled to turn down an invitation to any event you don't want to attend.", "I feel like we're missing a lot of background info here. Why is cousin excluding you in particular? Has there been conflict in the past?", "Maybe he had to pick his closest cousins, maybe he couldn't pick more because his wife didn't have more she wanted on her side. I think this is petty.", "To be fair, the groom is not obligated to have any body they don't want to have in their party. They don't get to be upset that cousin didn't attend either.", "Precisely, when actually there doesn\u2019t have to be a problem at all- it just is what it is.", "Yes, you\u2019re right, to a point. The cousin has the right to make his own choices about the wedding party, but cannot then get mad that OP chooses not to go\u2026 you can\u2019t decide YOU don\u2019t feel close enough to someone but then get offended when they decide THEY don\u2019t feel close enough to you!", "Or it's the partner . That's my guess.", "While true, I'd say the big difference that elevates cousin into TA status is that he has all the other cousins in the wedding, and that puts OP in a very awkward situation where he is going to be noticeably left out by the rest of the family. There's also zero reason for cousin to get mad at OP not going, given the circumstances, unless that's kinda what he wants here", "Yes. Got one at 5. Why?", "The cousin is also whining about OP not coming to the wedding is that fine as well?", "I nearly included something about that, but there are too many variables. RSVP \"no\"? Call and say \"hope you have a great day ... sorry I'm going to have to miss it\"? Call cousin and pick a fight?", "Your issues with social gatherings and relationships struck me as being very similar to those on the spectrum. If you hadn\u2019t had a diagnosis, sometimes it can help to know you\u2019re neurodiverse and pick your battles", "NTA. You are obviously being excluded for a reason. Cousin refuses to even discuss the reason.  Don't go or give a gift.", "NTA, but cousin doesn\u2019t really seem to care all that much about you, so saying you won\u2019t show up probably isn\u2019t as much of a threat as you think. You should however still stay home, you don\u2019t seem to be all that wanted there. I\u2019m sorry", "YTA\n\nYou know what you did but you left it out to get the sub on your side. When everybody in your life hates you, that's what we call a \"You\" problem, OP.  \n\nI remember you from that shit post of yours on the Minnesota sub complaining that Minneapolis is \"unsafe\" because of \"that BLM thing.\" I really wouldn't be surprised if you're one of those assholes that think there are still riots and arsons happening on the regular. I sure as hell would never invite a bitcoiner that thinks that trump had the election stolen from **any** event.", "Highjacking the top comment to say that I checked OP's post history on a lark and it sounds like this happens a lot to him - his cousin doesn't like him for unknown reasons, his coworker doesn't like him for unknown reasons, his management doesn't like him for unknown reasons, his peers in school didn't like him for unknown reasons, etc.\n\nSounds like there's a lot more going on here. I wouldn't want to guess, but he made at least one homophobic comment that I saw and also claimed to be on the spectrum, both of which could make socializing difficult, but for very different reasons.", "Why is the cousin the AH?  I am assuming if he is purposely excluding OP, there must be a reason.  My vote is NAH.", "You've got it backwards. OP is an asshole to the people around him and the cousin is sick of his shit. Check the post history. He's a BLM hating conservative that thinks that Minneapolis is unsafe because of BLM.  Almost his entire post history is \"why does every single person from my childhood, college, dates, family and coworkers hate me.\"", "It **is** an OP problem. Everyone he interacts with thinks he's an asshole, and he can't seem to figure out why. It makes up nearly his entire post history, except the part where he's scared of BLM and apparently somebody else found a homophobic comment.", ">Not sure why he wouldn't involve you in activities, unless your relationship prior to the wedding wasn't that great? \n\nYou'll change your vote if you check his post history.", ">There has to be a reason you are not in the wedding party. \n\nNearly the entirety of OP's post history  is him not being able to figure out why every single person he interacts with hates him.

Is there a problem between you and him or his wife to cause him to act this way? \n\nIt's because OP is an asshole to everyone he meets.

Definitely comes off as the AH out of his own mouth.", "He also thinks trump had the election stolen from him, he's an over talkative bitcoiner, thinks that Minneapolis is \"unsafe\" because of \"that BLM thing\" (George Floyd, 2020), thinks hanging out with trump flags on trucks in front of polling places is fine (it's a crime in the state he was talking about), etc. He's an asshole for pretending not to know why people don't want to be around him so he can get sympathy NTAs from the sub. It's gross.", "This post isn't about me.  Do you think it's possible to make your comments about the issue?  I don't have it backwards.  I have it different.  Please take a moment and try to figure out that backwards and different aren't the same.  Well maybe you can't.", "I think the asshole part is the groom lying.  Just be upfront and say we aren\u2019t close enough (emotionally) for you to be in the wedding party but I\u2019d like you as a guest, rather than just flat out lying about the reason.", "I have major doubts that the cousin was actually mad. Why would he be? The OP sounds like he was being a pest trying to wiggle his way into the wedding.", "YTA you KNOW why folks don\u2019t associate with you! You\u2019re PURPOSELY leaving ALL of that out for the NTA votes when commenters are LITERALLY going through your post history and see how YOU treat people", "YTA. He's trying to reach out, despite your post history making it obvious you buried the lede and are a thoroughly unpleasant person to be around. I wouldn't have invited you to the wedding at all. He's mad because he's trying to come up with restricted ways to keep up contact with you without you causing problems and you shut him down AND complain about how he's at fault.", "NTA.  If you don\u2019t want to go don\u2019t.  He\u2019s wasn\u2019t obligated to invite you and you\u2019re not obligated to accept.

He doesn\u2019t like you enough to have you in the wedding. Based on your reaction and subsequent whining, I can see why. You don\u2019t have to go to a wedding you don\u2019t want to go to.

Assumptions are part of decision making because all of the facts are usually not here.", "OP clarifies in a different comment he's autistic, so there's a chance this is a neurodivergent issue, as well- which can either be justified or icky, depending on the cousin. Either way, it does mean things have to be clearly spelled out for OP or there will be confusion", "EVERYBODY is autistic WHEN they get called out for their unacceptable behavior. OP is NOT reliable so it\u2019s hard to believe anything he says bc he switches up more than the wind"]}
