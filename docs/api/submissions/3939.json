It doesn't sound like the relationship is important to him.", "It sounds like your cousin has an issue with you. That much is very obvious. I am just not sure if you know what the issue is and trying to play innocent here or if this is really out of the blue. Either way I say NTA because your fault or not, there is no reason to be around someone who does not like you and the same applies if you don't like him.", "Here\u2019s the deal. You are not obligated to attend the wedding. You don\u2019t even need an excuse. Just respond \u201cno\u201d if there\u2019s an RSVP and move on. NTA.", "NTA.  Cousin is obviously an asshole.  What's the point of going to the wedding of an asshole?", "NTA A wedding invite is not a summons.  It is ok to avoid events you don\u2019t want to go to.", "NTA. Don\u2019t go.", "NTA- not going is just avoiding buying into their drama and avoids giving them the satisfaction of cutting you out\u2026", "NTA at all. \n\nYour cousin clearly couldn't be bothered to care about you, and you definitely aren't obliged to attend someone's wedding. Sure, it's polite, but if he's not giving you any respect or courtesy then he shouldn't expect any back.", "NTA. He's trying to turn you into the problem instead of him", "NAH. You're not obligated to go to the wedding just because you're related. He's not obligated to have you in the wedding just because you're related.\n\nNot sure why he wouldn't involve you in activities, unless your relationship prior to the wedding wasn't that great?", "Nta \n\nIncidentally. I\u2019ve just looked at your post history. \n\nHave you ever had an autism diagnosis?", "NTA It sounds like he failed to communicate why he left you out. Distance isn't a good enough reason. Because it is your decision to say to him, I'm sorry but the distance is too far, not for him to decide for you, without discussing it. Because he failed to talk open and honestly, you have ended up feeling unwanted, hurt, excluded and isolated, so you cannot be blamed here for deciding not to go.", "NTA\n\nI doubt this is the first incident with this cousin. Don't go where you are not wanted.", "NTA And your cousin was a d bag! He singled you out. He can take a walk\u2026", "I\u2019m getting downvoted here, but NAH. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely entitled to be upset by not being in the wedding party and it\u2019s your prerogative not to attend. \nThat said, it\u2019s his wedding and the day is about him and his partner\u2026 they get to choose who\u2019s in his wedding party \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fIt\u2019s a bit rubbish about the baseball though.", "NTA for not going to the wedding, but have you maintained a relationship with this cousin? There has to be a reason you are not in the wedding party.", "nTA. He doesn't care about your presence so why give it to him?", "NTA\n\n\nYou don't have to go to someone's wedding just because they invite you.", "NTA. He made it clear that he doesn\u2019t consider you close so you have no obligation to go out of your way for him- after all, you live two hours away, attending his wedding would be too difficult for you \ud83d\ude01. \n\nHe is just desperate to not come out of this looking like he did anything wrong and because he actually knows he looks rude he has to make YOU look rude\u2026 ignore all of this and let him flounder.", "NTA\n\nDo not justify or respond to anything, just send your invite back as \"no\" and move on. You have every right not to go, and he put you in a very awkward position of essentially being the only cousin without a role, which will be obvious to your family at the wedding. He obviously either has an issue or just doesn't care, and that's fine, but I'd say just match his energy and avoid discussing it beyond saying you can't attend", "NTA, sounds like he's mad cuz he can't rub it in your face in person at his wedding", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is fine not to have you in a special role and just invite you as a guest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine not to go. But stop the whining, he did nothing wrong.", "Sadly, it\u2019s *his* and *his wife\u2019s* wedding, it\u2019s their day, their event, they make all the calls. It\u2019s about *them*. BUT you should be included somehow, especially once they know you feel left out. It\u2019s also you right to not go to a wedding if you feel uncomfortable, left out, etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is a hard AH here. The bride and groom get to choose their wedding party and you can choose not to come. \n\n*But also we need more information here- You never know, it may not be from him could be from his wife. Is there a problem between you and him or his wife to cause him to act this way?*", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your cousin is probably an asshole in general, but he's entitled to choose who is in his wedding party so in this context he isn't wrong. In exactly the same way, you are entitled to turn down an invitation to any event you don't want to attend.", "I feel like we're missing a lot of background info here. Why is cousin excluding you in particular? Has there been conflict in the past?", "Maybe he had to pick his closest cousins, maybe he couldn't pick more because his wife didn't have more she wanted on her side. I think this is petty.", "To be fair, the groom is not obligated to have any body they don't want to have in their party. They don't get to be upset that cousin didn't attend either.", "Precisely, when actually there doesn\u2019t have to be a problem at all- it just is what it is.", "Yes, you\u2019re right, to a point. The cousin has the right to make his own choices about the wedding party, but cannot then get mad that OP chooses not to go\u2026 you can\u2019t decide YOU don\u2019t feel close enough to someone but then get offended when they decide THEY don\u2019t feel close enough to you!", "Or it's the partner . That's my guess.", "While true, I'd say the big difference that elevates cousin into TA status is that he has all the other cousins in the wedding, and that puts OP in a very awkward situation where he is going to be noticeably left out by the rest of the family. There's also zero reason for cousin to get mad at OP not going, given the circumstances, unless that's kinda what he wants here", "Yes. Got one at 5. Why?", "The cousin is also whining about OP not coming to the wedding is that fine as well?", "I nearly included something about that, but there are too many variables. RSVP \"no\"? Call and say \"hope you have a great day ... sorry I'm going to have to miss it\"? Call cousin and pick a fight?", "Your issues with social gatherings and relationships struck me as being very similar to those on the spectrum. If you hadn\u2019t had a diagnosis, sometimes it can help to know you\u2019re neurodiverse and pick your battles"]}
