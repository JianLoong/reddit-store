She told me it would be better for the boys to be together always and that with a 4 year age gap they will never know the half stuff if she and I were to work together and raise them as \"ours\".

She said I have proven to be an amazing dad to our son and she just wants the same for her son. Then she told me our son wanted his brother at my house and I was an ass for ignoring that too. I spoke to my son yesterday and he never asked for that or said he wanted it. He did say his mom told him to say he wanted his half brother at my house too and that he wanted me to be his half brother's daddy. But he didn't care. Ex's words get to me though. Maybe because I know her son doesn't really have anyone outside my ex and my son, and my son is more into friends than his half brother.

He walked over with my son and held his arms out like he wanted to be hugged/held and said he was coming too. He looked so happy. I felt bad because I was not going to bring him. I gently told him to return to his mom. Poor kid looked so confused. I left with my son quickly so no fight could ensue. \n\nEx started texting me late Friday night and all day yesterday saying I was a dick and I should have had my heart melt enough to let him come. She said I have proven to be an amazing dad to our son and she just wants the same for her son. Then she told me our son wanted his brother at my house and I was an ass for ignoring that too. I spoke to my son yesterday and he never asked for that or said he wanted it. He did say his mom told him to say he wanted his half brother at my house too and that he wanted me to be his half brother's daddy. But he didn't care. Ex's words get to me though. Maybe because I know her son doesn't really have anyone outside my ex and my son, and my son is more into friends than his half brother.

And when you do have a woman in your life? She probably is going to make it really hard on you and that woman!", "You're clearly a good guy. This is why she wants you to be her younger son's father.\n\nShe is desperate, and it is really sad to hear about someone so pathetic as your ex. Have you reached out to her family? Maybe they know the boy's father and maybe know his family.\n\nI think you need to go back to your lawyer for more advice. You can't keep fighting this alone.", "I hope you are going for custody. This will mess up both kids.", "Does her family know what she's doing?  I mean it's literally mental abuse.\nDCFS should be notified.  Sorry your having to go through this.  NTA OP.", "Also consider getting your son into therapy to help combat his mother's emotional manipulation", "Jesus I am so sorry you don't sound like a monster. You take care of your kid and now she wants to come crawling back... And is using her kids to do it.\n\nCan you take her back to family court? Tell them what she's doing? Manipulating a child is a form of abuse.", "Are you sure she hasn\u2019t told the 4 year old you\u2019re his daddy too?", "That\u2019s EXACTLY what she\u2019s doing and it is emotionally abusive and mentally abusive- leaving the boy to question why he\u2019s not good enough. \nShe is a cruel woman.", "My guess is she told her second kid that you are his father actually, but you refuse to take him, you take only his brother.", "The best advice I can offer is to rush through pick ups. Upon contact clearly state that youre just their to pick up one kid who needs to make his eay immefiately to your vehicle. If she has anything to say about your shared son, she can text it to you. If she starts the bs, talk over her repeating \"I am here for my kid.\" Then walk away.", "Could pickups be done at school?  Like you arrange to pick him up from school on fridays?  That way you don\u2019t have to see her at all", "Yeah she would absolutely hand over both kids to the intermediary, say you\u2019d agreed to it and then high tail it out of there before they could confirm. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s become unhealthily fixated tbh because the way she\u2019s persisting despite being told no repeatedly isn\u2019t rational. I suspect she\u2019s convinced herself that if you spend time with her younger son you\u2019ll fall in love with him and everyone will live happily ever after.  I\u2019m getting vibes of massive guilt that her cheating on you also cheated her son out having a good dad because she cheated with a deadbeat. She could do with counselling to come to terms with the fact that she screwed up and this isn\u2019t the way to make it up to her youngest.  Keep an eye on things re her mental health - she got herself into the mess, but 24/7 parenting the youngest is likely exhausting and you may need to intervene for your son if she\u2019s struggling.", "Check with your attorney to see if you cam bring a witness", "That is fine, I am used to being judged. I never said that there aren't outliers, but stats clearly show an increase in juvenile crime in single parent households. Stats also show that 80% of single parent homes are single mother households. \n\nI will retract the statement in the second quote you took on me but if you are saying that a father figure is not important, I will whole-heartedly disagree", "I hear ya, just make sure your decisions are based on what you need, rather than trying to spite the ex.", "The similarities in your experience add really valuable perspective, but also the OP sounds very different from the picture you paint of your mom. OP sounds very good with boundaries, for example. I\u2019m not trying to guilt anybody, just trying to add perspective and nuance just like you.", "I feel  bad for the 4 year old in this scenario. \n\nThe rest of you are fine. You\u2019re an adult, she\u2019s an adult, have your custody share, the 8 year old\nIs happy enough and doesn\u2019t mind if his brother stays home. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything you can do about it if she repeats it, you just have to send him back to his mom at pick up and then feel bad until one day you don\u2019t feel bad anymore or she or the boy gives up.", "I\u2019m not saying she would be successful, but courts are designed to perpetuate conflict, and lawyers encourage it because money. Appeal after appeal after appeal - can go on forever ans just nasty nasty nasty. You have to think of all possibilities, it\u2019s basically warfare.", "Hopefully she stops trying to ambush you with this other kid, she sounds like a real piece of work", "Unfortunately she already knows your a good man it probably seems easier to try and get you to play daddy for youngest. Dating as a single parent is hard people aren\u2019t always what they seem she\u2019s avoiding the effort NTA", "She says it's because her son sees our son with me, and she knows I'm a good dad, so it would be easier and better for her son to have me. But her choices are the reason I'm not her son's dad. That's something she has to own and accept and figure out a way to help him deal with that.", "NTA", "I told her I didn't love her and was disgusted by her so much that I would never see her the same way again.

They never even knew our son let alone her second son.", "We have already been to court over this. It didn't stop her. She just packed him up and brought him off like he was coming with. I need to document a few instances of this happening for it to go anywhere in court again. Just like I need to document (and have) the fact she was coaching our son as well.", "And a cheat", "In the interim, this is absolutely the best solution!", ">Stats also show that 80% of single parent homes are single mother households\n\nThis is the perfect rebuttal to your initial statement that \"fathers get shafted by society\". \n\nr/SelfAwareWolves content right there. Because it's clearly not the mothers leaving so how are they being shafted?\n\nYou also seem to be implying that children raised by women are more likely to end up in prison, completely missing the nuance here. Single-parent households are far more likely to be financially striken which is one of the main contributing factors to a life of crime and systemic poverty. And you're really trying to pin that on single mothers rather than on the father's that just up and left? You're doing that with a straight face?\n\n\nSure, having two kind and loving parents is certainly better than having just one or none at all. On the other hand, it's best to have one kind and loving parent than a household where one of them is a deadbeat.\n\nThat doesn't mean it has to be a \"father figure\". \n\nAdditionally, you're further implying that kid with two female parents is more likely to do poorly in life because they didn't have a father figure? \n\nYour comments just reads as \"I'm a man, woe is me\". \n\n\"Father figure\" - laughable.\n\nIn any case, not OP's kid. He's certainly NTA for asserting his boundaries and being firm.", "Except in this case there really isn't that much of a \"nuance\". OP has stated in his comments how his son is totally fine with the half brother not going to OPs place. He understands his dad is not his brother's dad and he has been exposed to enough blended families. The lessons you mentioned in your original comment can be taught in other ways too. It doesn't have to be through manipulation and pushing boundaries. \n\nEspecially when it comes to small kids, more times than not \"good intentions\" don't always lead to right actions.", "Oh yea, I know as of right now we're not that far yet, but the fact that it's even considerable that this could happen in the future makes my skin crawl lol.", "Get a lawyer to send her a cease and desist. NTA", "Have you talked to the court about it continuing? They may require your son be picked up by from school or some other neutral mediator. And you\u2019re right OP- it would be better and easier but not for her other son but for her.", "She's doing it to get out of parenting her kid for a while.", "I fail to see how this is your problem at all. She chose to cheat on you. She chose to not have safe sex to prevent a pregnancy with someone else. Now she expects you to raise a kid that isn\u2019t yours because you\u2019re a good dad? Honestly sounds like she wants her weekends kid free so she can go out and find another baby daddy. \n\nI can only imagine how hurt this kid is after she hypes him up about going to spend time with his dad that isn\u2019t his dad.

Like give her an example.. Bring your son and 10 other kids the same age group.. While you can be cordial with the 10 other kids, the \"good dad\" aspect of you will only come out for your son. I think with how much you've tried explaining you've probably already told her this.. But I just wanna say. \n\nTell her you'll never be a \"good dad\" to her son because you do not have the kind of love and emotions toward him. He's just like every other random kid you see (like in your son's school there will be other boys but they wouldn't be the same as your son). Tell her if she (by some chance) manages to send her kid with your kid you'll make sure the kid knows whose dad you are (I don't mean you have to do this. Just harsh words to scare her off). Tell her you have the potential to make life a living hell for her kid (if she does not believe you show her reddit posts of step parents being totally rude to their partner's kids) and if she is even a half decent mom she'll want better for her kid because no kid deserves to be felt like a burden.", "Yeah your son is the most important little man in your world and because of that it is important to move on with your life!
