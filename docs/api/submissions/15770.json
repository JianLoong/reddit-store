{"id": 15770, "submission_id": "1301zat", "title": "WIBTA for getting a dog in a pet friendly rental (that I specifically chose because it is pet friendly) even though someone I am sharing the rental with has a horrible dog allergy", "selftext": "Over the summer I [23F] got an internship  working for a really great company. The company is relocating me New York, and I will be in a rental \u201ctriplex\u201d  with other people my age who are working the same job. The place I am staying in specifically said they were pet-friendly, which was why I chose to live there. I should add that I will have my own personal bedroom on the second floor with a bathroom that I share with only one other person. Our kitchen is separate from the first and third floor kitchens, with the only shared space between the first, second and third floors being the entry and stairs. I\u2019ve been wanting a dog for a very long time, and I\u2019ll finally be financially stable enough to have one. I found the sweetest rescue puppy, and am in the process of getting him right now.\n\nI just shot a message to the group to let them know that I would have a dog, but that he would only be staying in my private room, and would be in the staircase/ entry when I take him on walks. A guy in the group said that he is extremely allergic to dogs, to the point where a dog even passing through the shared entry way will give him a rash, swollen eyes, and sometimes a trip to the hospital. He absolutely does not want me to have one. He lives on the first floor and I live on the second.\n\nI am getting this dog, there is no doubt about it. He\u2019s my dream dog. I have saved up for months to get him. I have a name for him (Dex!) and bought all of the supplies I need. I have also already signed the 4 month lease for the house, along with everyone else. \n\nHere is where people are saying I am the asshole. I think that since this guy is so allergic to dogs, he absolutely should not have chosen a shared house that states very clearly that it is pet friendly, or at least told everyone four months ago when we were all finding housemates that he was extremely allergic to dogs. I had not decided if I wanted a dog at that time either, so it at least would have prevented me from putting so much time and effort into getting the do I want now. I told him this but everyone else is telling me I am being selfish, especially since I haven\u2019t even gotten my dog yet and could just not get him. They say that i should have thought about that and asked before I signed thee lease, but I just assumed since the rental said it was pet friendly that everyone would be okay with pets. I get that this guy cannot control his allergy, and did not know someone would be bringing a pet, but I can\u2019t help but think this is because of his lack of communication, and not on me.

Even if it stays in your room. It's their house too, they have a say. \n\nSecond, poor dog. Being limited to only one room, except for walks, will make him a very bored dog. The dog deserves better than this. Wait until you have a place of your own where he'll have enough space.", "YTA\n\nYou don't tell roommates you're getting a pet, you ask if it's okay. This is a shared housing situation. There is no way for this to not affect them.\n\n>I am getting this dog, there is no doubt about it.\n\nThen find solo housing or roommates who are up for having a dog in the home.\n\n> he absolutely should not have chosen a shared house that states very clearly that it is pet friendly,\n\nNope. It's on you to declare if you have a pet or ask about getting one.", "YTA twice! First of all:\n\n> Only staying in my private room\n\nA dog needs a bit more space than that to be happy, I would reconsider whether or not you do have the necessary room for a dog. Secondly, and while I understand that your are annoyed at your roommate, if he truly has allergies to the point where he needs to go to the hospital then that should answer all the questions.\n\nYes, living in a pet friendly place with allergies like that is stupid. Yes, he should make people aware of them if they are that bad. But does that mean you can just ignore that? Maybe, but it will certainly make you the asshole.", "~~Is the dog hypoallergenic?~~\n\nYTA, if his allergies are that bad, then he will definitely have a reaction. If you want the dog that badly, move somewhere else.", "Okay, so you signed a 4 month lease, while not communicating that you were planning on getting a dog. \n\n>I think that since this guy is so allergic to dogs, he absolutely should not have chosen a shared house that states very clearly that it is pet friendly, or at least told everyone four months ago when we were all finding housemates that he was extremely allergic to dogs.\n\nSo you think it's okay for you to NOT voice your plans of getting a pet (not a service animal or even and ESA) but he needs to give you medical details of his life? When he was moving into a home with no pets? \n\nAlso, just because it's \"pet friendly\" doesn't mean you are obligated to get a dog or he would have to live with one. Dogs are one of many pets he could have lived with (cats, birds, fish, ferrets,) so you acting like this is a problem on his part is very ahole behavior.\n\nYou are the one changing the terms of your living situation with your roommates. They absolutely should be able to veto such a large change in their situation. When you live with housemates that's the part of the social contract you take.\n\nAlso, it sounds very irresponsible of you to adopt a young dog during a very important internship when you know your housing is not stable currently. \n\nPuppies are a hell of a lot of responsibility. And you bringing this dog into an environment where he's not even wanted is wrong.\n\nIf that guy is smart he would contact the rescue you're going through and tell them the situation so they'll deny your application. That dog shouldn't be in that house. \n\nYTA", "YTA. The rental is pet friendly,  which means it allows pets for pet owners, it doesn't mean you have to have a pet to live there, and your roommate didn't know you would be getting a pet when he moved in. \n\nBecause this wasn't explicitly agreed to beforehand, you're the asshole for getting a dog without all roommates permission", "Dont get a social pet like a dog if youre living with people who dont want it and youre planning on keeping it locked up in your nyc (aka tiny) bedroom. Thats not a fair life for a dog", "YTA - pet friendly or not, it\u2019s incredibly inconsiderate to all of your housemates for committing to a dog without the consent of everyone living there. \n\nYou might think the dog is only going to pass through shared spaces on the way to get a walk but did you take into consideration the sounds they make. How about when you\u2019re not home, will they have to tolerate the barking and howling if there\u2019s separation anxiety. The list can go on.", "YTA\n\nShould have indicated that you would be getting a dog before you agreed to become roommates.

You\u2019re seriously going to keep this puppy confined to your tiny NYC bedroom?", "Gonna go soft YTA. \n\nThis sounds like a summer internship, so I would just postpone the dog purchase until your back at your own place in a few months. This is the best solution anyhow, since presumably you\u2019ll be working and networking with your internship and you\u2019ll have no time for doggy bathroom breaks, vet visits, etc. It\u2019s also not nice to have a young dog alone in a small bedroom all day. \n\nApparently you\u2019re allowed to have pets in this apartment, but since it\u2019s shared, short-term housing, I imagine your roommates weren\u2019t expecting to have someone with a dog.", "Info: Why do you think its a good idea to confine a rescue dog in a room at all times unless they are going out for a walk? You do realize the dog will likely be unhappy.", "YTA. You\u2019re saying someone that has a dog allergy shouldn\u2019t live in an apartment that permits pets? That\u2019s borderline insane. And it\u2019s common decency to ask your roommates before getting a pet that will impact their own living situation.", "YWBTA. All roommates should consent to getting a pet that will live in a shared space. The guy is dumb for living in a pet friendly space, but that doesn\u2019t absolve you from being an asshole for knowingly doing this.", "I am a dog lover.  I am also allergic.  I have been giving myself allergy shots for 3 years now, because I really don't enjoy having a stuffed up nose and red, runny eyes.  I can suffer if I want to have a dog.  I have no right to cause someone else to suffer so I can call have a dog.  Yes you would definitely be TA!", "YTA. I have allergies. It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cbad\u201d allergies are. What matters is exposure to allergens. An allergic response is caused by a person\u2019s immune system thinking the animal dander is a danger and has to be eliminated. That\u2019s what causes all the allergy symptoms. It\u2019s not healthy or pleasant for anyone to constantly have their immune system overwhelmed by allergens. Imagine constantly having cold symptoms every day with no relief. That\u2019s what you would be doing to your roommate.", "YWBTA. Pet friendly literally just means.... pet FRIENDLY. Like, you CAN have a pet. Not that you're REQUIRED to have a pet and everyone who moves in will need to get a pet ASAP? Maybe he didn't have other options. Maybe, as you've stated, you did not disclose that you wanted a dog when the housing arrangements were being made. This is very obvious to me.", "YTA.", "YTA You have many years to get a dog in the future. It makes no sense to do it when, one you'll be putting your roommate into a health crisis, and two you won't be providing the best experience for your dog. Now is just not the time.", "YTA - you've decided you're financially stable enough to get a dog based on an internship and a 4 month lease? You know dogs love for 10-15+ years, right? What if your next place isn't pet friendly? Or the internship doesn't lead to a good job? You're not ready. \n\nAnd keeping a dog confined to one room except for walks is cruel. Be prepared for some really difficult behaviours.", "YWBTAH for getting a dog and confining it to one small room.  That's cruel, regardless of how sick it makes a roommate.  Its a real dick move to make someone sick in their own home and imprison a young dog just because it's something you've always wanted.  Don't be selfish and make others suffer--human or animal.", "YTA. You stated that their allergies could put them in hospital and you still want to get a dog?

Holy shit you\u2019re a huge AH \n\nAlso, the dog will only be staying in the private room? That\u2019s so cruel to the dog, how would you feel being cooped up in one room all day every day?", "YWBTA. I mean... c'mon. You're willing to put somebody through suffering for your own wants.

I chose to take in 4 stray cats but not when I lived with other people!", "I would not get a puppy in a shared living situation with random strangers.  I especially wouldn\u2019t do so if not all of them wanted to live with a puppy. That\u2019s a shitty thing to do to your housemates, and an even shittier thing to do to the puppy. YTA. \n\nI\u2019m also really surprised a rescue group would place a puppy in that situation. 98% of the rescues in my area won\u2019t place a dog with me because I\u2019m in an apartment and don\u2019t have a fenced yard. But at least I don\u2019t have roommates or live on an upper floor.", "YTA You are not doing what is best for you dog. This is not a suitable situation for a puppy.

This is an awful plan.", "YTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re sharing a house, you have to get all roommates to agree to getting an animal.

Why do all these people think it's OK to shove a poor puppy or kitten in to a single room all day? Seriously ITS NOT OKAY. ITS ABUSE. Dogs and cats need room, they need interaction, they need exercise, they need fresh air. Fuck you walk into my place there's no doubt that cats live here. There's toys, beds, trees, perches, caves, safe nibbling plants, and tunnels everywhere. \n\nThere's also an 80lb dog that has 2 beds 2 bins of toys, a big footstool in front of a window to sit at, multiple snuffle mats, and his own spot on the couch. If I'm gone more than 2 hours that I can't check in on him he goes to one of his grandparents for a visit. He gets 2  2.5km walkies a day sometimes longer depending on weather.

Have you thought about where you might live after this internship, and whether or not it will be conducive to having a dog? I feel like this may be a bit of an impulsive decision, and that maybe you should wait until you're in a more permanent location. \n\nHonestly, I don't think a NY apartment is great for house training a puppy. You have to walk them every single time they have to go out. And what kind of hours will you be working during this internship? Who's going to take care of the puppy while you're at work? When you move in 4 months, you'll have to start house training all over again. Puppies do puppy things for *at least* a year.\n\nI feel more sorry for the puppy than I do for your housemate.

Just because a rental is pet-friendly doesn't mean you can have a pet without agreement of your housemates and explicit approval of your landlord for the specific animal. Plenty of \"pet friendly\" rentals have restrictions on dog size or breeds, prohibit puppies, are only \"pet friendly\" for cats, or have other restrictions in place.

Only 8 hour days.\n\nAs far as the actual apartment situation, dude is either lying because he just doesn't want a dog around, or he's a complete moron. Allergies can be serious, and we should care about those around us, but on no planet does someone with allergies get to knowingly move into pet-friendly accommodations and then forbid people from having pets. In this scenario, the appropriate thing is for him to find somewhere else to live that does not allow pets.", "YWBTA for several reasons.  First, the person getting a pet checks with all the other roommates before getting a pet.  This should have been a conversation you initiated with your roommates.  Second, you should not get a pet when you're just starting a job.  You need to actually work the job, understand what the demands will be & what life will look like before you even consider it.  Third, do you really not understand how allergies work?", "ESH. Sounds like this may be your first big living in the adult world for real time. You are well within your rental rights to get the dog.

Or when you did decide to get one, told them before you made arrangements. I love animals and i know what it\u2019s like to want to own a dog\u2026 but also, you have to be considerate of other people that you\u2019re living with and can\u2019t assume that just because a place is pet friendly, everyone there will be okay with pets.", "NTA. If you can't life with dogs, it's your responsibility to not rent with roommates somewhere advertised as dog-friendly.

The company is relocating me New York, and I will be in a rental \u201ctriplex\u201d  with other people my age who are working the same job. The place I am staying in specifically said they were pet-friendly, which was why I chose to live there. I should add that I will have my own personal bedroom on the second floor with a bathroom that I share with only one other person. Our kitchen is separate from the first and third floor kitchens, with the only shared space between the first, second and third floors being the entry and stairs. I\u2019ve been wanting a dog for a very long time, and I\u2019ll finally be financially stable enough to have one. I found the sweetest rescue puppy, and am in the process of getting him right now.\n\nI just shot a message to the group to let them know that I would have a dog, but that he would only be staying in my private room, and would be in the staircase/ entry when I take him on walks. A guy in the group said that he is extremely allergic to dogs, to the point where a dog even passing through the shared entry way will give him a rash, swollen eyes, and sometimes a trip to the hospital. He absolutely does not want me to have one. He lives on the first floor and I live on the second.\n\nI am getting this dog, there is no doubt about it. He\u2019s my dream dog. I have saved up for months to get him. I have a name for him (Dex!) and bought all of the supplies I need. I have also already signed the 4 month lease for the house, along with everyone else. \n\nHere is where people are saying I am the asshole. I think that since this guy is so allergic to dogs, he absolutely should not have chosen a shared house that states very clearly that it is pet friendly, or at least told everyone four months ago when we were all finding housemates that he was extremely allergic to dogs. I had not decided if I wanted a dog at that time either, so it at least would have prevented me from putting so much time and effort into getting the do I want now. I told him this but everyone else is telling me I am being selfish, especially since I haven\u2019t even gotten my dog yet and could just not get him. They say that i should have thought about that and asked before I signed thee lease, but I just assumed since the rental said it was pet friendly that everyone would be okay with pets. I get that this guy cannot control his allergy, and did not know someone would be bringing a pet, but I can\u2019t help but think this is because of his lack of communication, and not on me. Am I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are an irresponsible ah.", "YTA because that\u2019s not how a dog should live. Having to keep the dog just in your bedroom is unfair to the dog.", "And if he has an anaphylactic reaction?

That person has to live there also", "YTA and clearly don't know enough about what a puppy needs to thrive to be getting one.

You need to first ask all your housemates if it is okay for you to get a dog, especially since none of you had pets when you moved in. You don't just research it, buy a bunch of dog shit, sign papers for a dog, and THEN just tell them you are getting a dog. That is really messed up. \n\nYou dog is going to need a lot more room than just your room. Dogs need to wander around and have space. What you are planning is going to be cruel to that dog.\n\nWorst of all, your housemate is going to get sick because of your selfishness.

It's valid to choose the dog and a different arrangement, but you can't have both.  If that means you're out a bit on the lease, well, that's the choice you've made.\n\nYou *are* being selfish.  Both toward your roommates (who do get a say in whether they share a home with a dog) and toward the dog.  One room all day?  And when you bring him through the house to take him on walks that'll *still* be more than enough to set off your roommate's allergies!

A rescue even more so. Presumably this is a Summer Internship, which means your performance will be scrutinized.

I understand your point on being pet friendly and whatnot but you\u2019re not thinking about what\u2019s best for everyone and for this puppy!

I think it best if you wait!", "YTA for future dog abuse. Dogs need loads of room. Honestly SMH!", "Your roommates should appeal to your landlord and see if he can revoke your lease.  The dog cannot be shut up into one room.  You want a dog, get your own apartment. yta", "> but I just assumed since the rental said it was pet friendly that everyone would be okay with pets.\n\nThis is where YTA. That's not how pets and shared living situations work. \"Pet-friendly\" means the landlord won't stop you, but it doesn't say anything about the other people living there being on board. For example, what if they chose pet-friendly housing because they have a dog, but are horribly allergic to cats? You should always discuss getting a pet with the people you live with prior to getting the pet.\nAnd as a small aside, how big is this single room you plan on keeping the dog in? How much time are you going to have to take him out? If i were the rescue you're adopting from, I'd have some serious concerns about his welfare if I knew you were planning on keeping him restricted to your bedroom.", "Please do not get this dog. \n\nI also live in a large city with a cost of living crisis that has lead to an increase in professional sharers. In cases like this all parties need to agree to the dog. Also, as everyone has said, you need to look into a doggy daycare or dog walker service for the pup.  \n\nDogs are expensive, please also consider pet insurance. If you had to \u201csave for months\u201d to cover the rescue fee I am guessing you don\u2019t have the money put aside if there is a medical emergency. \n\nMost importantly, a pet friendly rental doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can have a pet. I have applied for quite a few pet friendly flats and been declined by the landlord because they had other offers of people without pets. In general you will still need landlord approval and to pay an additional pet deposit.

This could be fatal.  Talk with the shelter.  See if they can find a foster for the next few months until your lease is up and you can find a new pet friendly place.  Also have you notified your landlord that you will be getting a pet.  Often there is a clause that you need to as the deposit is bigger, higher rent and move out cleaning fee.", "YTA", "Good God YTA.\n\nPlease don\u2019t come to NY.

It\u2019s not even a tough call.

If you get this dog, the person with allergies this severe told you that they could end up hospitalized.  So basically, this person can't live there anymore and will have to make new housing arrangements.  They will be homeless, on short notice, because you can't wait until the summer is over to get a dog.\n\nThe housing arrangements were made by your employer.  Are these your coworkers?  Do you really want to start the summer known as the person who has such a poor ability to play well with others that you decided to make another guy either deal with debilitating sickness, or lose his housing?  Because you couldn't wait four more months to get a dog?\n\nSure the apartment was listed as pet friendly, but most people living in temporary shared housing don't have pets, for a lot of good reasons such as dogs cannot humanely be confined to a single room unless they are tiny and lazy (a Boston is neither.  They are insanely high energy).   And you found the information that the apartment was pet friendly because it was a priority for you, but was this obvious to other people?  Were there other housing options available that were advertised as pet free, for the allergy sufferer, or was this the only thing offered by the employer?\n\nYou also don't know what this dog will do when you're out of the house-- it could very well bark and howl like crazy, or chew things, running the risk of you getting evicted or losing a security deposit, and making your housemates hate you in the process.", "Yes!!!", "Yes", "I think everyone else has covered why YWBTA, but I wanted to ask, do you all work for the same company?

This is a temporary housing situation for the internship, you\u2019re not out on your own so you have to take roomies opinions into consideration. You don\u2019t even have a full time job which makes me question if you\u2019re financially ready for this too, do you know how expensive one emergency vet visit can be???

She didn\u2019t communicate with roommates until after deciding on getting a dog, assumed everyone would be fine with it and then is upset that the other person didn\u2019t do the communicating and assumed there wouldn\u2019t be a dog?..", "Or your next rental may not be dog friendly.", "And fourth, it's an internship. You are supposed to spend the time working hard and socializing with your cohort, not taking care of a pet. That won't help your long term prospects at that company.", "The puppy will be alone for how long every day and it's space is so confined. I got a puppy a few months back and despite a large house and yard, lots of playing and training and interacting with humans and playing with another dog, she chewed a chair...and a wall. Cuz teething also sucks. I can't imagine the destruction a small room all the time will result in.", "5$ OP is getting a border collie or some other dog breed without doing the minimum research of what is required. A pet is a big responsibility. Even a toy dog will be miserable staying in a room all day long. That's when they get destructive, owner then gets a cage and finally abandoned. OP is TA", "That is horrifying.", "YTA. Haven\u2019t seen this pointed out, but you said you saved up for months yet didn\u2019t once think to mention this to your roommates in those months?", "Here\u2019s my advice. DO NOT HET A DOG UNTIL TOU HAVE SPENT SOME  TIME LIVING IN NYC. New York is different beast to any other place I have ever been to or lived at. Things do not operate as you expect they will. Don\u2019t trust the subway to run on time. I cannot count the number of times I\u2019ve been on it and it\u2019s just shut down, and then your stuck. You will want a social life, and depending on your commute, you may not have time for a dog and a social life. The common advice here is give it a good 6 months to really get settled and figure things out. And yeah, YTA for wanting to get a dog when you live in a shared space and one is severely allergic. You want a dog? Make sure your roommates are ok with it beforehand.", "No all pets are dogs. He has a dog allergy what if he\u2019s okay with cats or want a fish?", "Agreed. I bet if the rescue knew she was planning on keeping it locked in her single bedroom all day, except when she takes it for a walk, I doubt they would want to home a puppy with her. OP is beyond selfish. Not just towards her roommate, but towards that poor dog. Definite major YTA.", "Who said he had to leave the city?", "As someone that has severe allergies, it's extremely difficult in some areas to find housing that is specifically not. Took me and my wife months and months to find a place.", "There are tons of pet friendly places.  That doesn't mean a pet is there.  \n\nYou still discuss it with the people you live with.", "It\u2019s pet friendly, not pet *mandatory*.", "Do you still live at home? Even having a college roommate would let you know that getting a pet WITHOUT running it past all your roommate is a *terrible* idea and really not done.\n\nThis isn't \"Is this legal?\" or \"Is this perfectly logical?\" This is \"Am I the Asshole?\" and you are definitely the asshole if you acquire a pet in a shared living situation without clearing it with everyone else FIRST. Doesn't matter how pet-friendly the place is.\n\nSometimes that fucking sucks. And sometimes your roommate/housemates are completely unreasonable about it. (\"You're moving out in 30 days and I need to rescue this cat NOW or it will be put down!\" \"Nope, hate cats, sorry.\") But that is life -- you can't bring a pet into a situation unless everyone is okay with it.\n\nIn this situation, where the guy will GO TO THE HOSPITAL -- first of all, it's almost certainly NOT legal for OP to bring the dog in; even service dogs can be restricted in some situations where there's a human with a severe allergy, and a pet is not a service dog. Second of all, I hope OP has a LOT of spare cash for the lawsuit when they *deliberately trigger their housemate's allergies that they were forewarned about and send the housemate to an expensive ER visit.* Housemate won't even have to file it -- his insurance may go after OP to recoup the cost of the unnecessary visit, and that will be a lot uglier than small claims court with a roommate. ER visits very often trigger AUTOMATIC questionnaires that your health insurer REQUIRES you respond to about whether your ER visit was caused by a workplace accident (so they can go after workers' comp for reimbursement) or certain other conditions (so they can go after other insurance). My 18-month-old baby went to the ER and it triggered an automatic letter from our insurer about whether he was injured while working and if so for whom! We were required to respond or they had the right to limit or cease our coverage. (I literally wrote HE IS A BABY and that was fine.)\n\nPet-friendly does not mean \"pet okay.\" Pet-friendly means \"You can, in some circumstances, have a pet in this rental.\" I lived in rentals with my cats for years, and I always had to a) inform the landlord that I was acquiring a cat (or already had one); b) pay a pet deposit PER PET (and in some states they can increase the rent); c) have the pet added to the lease *which also required all roommates to sign the new lease*; and d) have my veterinarian fill out a form stating that my pet had all its shots and it wasn't a dangerous animal. The other thing is that \"pet-friendly\" means the landlord can just say \"Nah, no pet for you.\" There are a LOT of rentals that advertise themselves as pet-friendly, but find an excuse to refuse every pet request. The landlord can also say \"your specific animal cannot live here\" -- I lived in a place where someone had two well-trained but high-energy dogs whose toenails absolutely ruined all the floors and baseboards as they ran around the house, so that breed of dog and ONLY that breed was banned. The landlord can also say \"You, specifically, cannot have a pet.\" A larger institutional rental company will have clear rules and rejection reasons, but smaller landlords are often just like, \"You seem shady and like you wouldn't walk your dog enough.\" Which, you can sue about if you really want to (anyone can sue about anything), but not many places protect pet ownership or enforce fairness in pet rental rules.", "Wow. I\u2019m so sorry for that dog being passed down and neglected like that. It sucks.", "$5 it\u2019s a maligator!", "But he won\u2019t know until he gets the dog home whether this particular dog barks or is amenable to crate training quickly enough to be crated for hours on end. And a puppy absolutely can\u2019t be crated for an entire workday without multiple pee breaks.", "I had cats and roommates for many years, but like, my roommates knew about the cats before we moved in together. I also typically boarded my cats if I traveled, so that my roommate wouldn't be stuck caring for them, even though my roommates generally loved cats. Occasionally I'd let a roommate who was a close friend and who insisted repeatedly watch my cat over a short weekend (like I was leaving late Friday and back midday Sunday), but not if the litter box would have to be cleaned; that seemed unfair to my roommate.\n\n(Also my cats loved their boarding place, so it wasn't stressful for them. Just expensive for me.)", "That's fair but then it's also fair to any roommates to let them know you can't be around specific pets just as it's theirs to let you know that they're getting a pet. Communication is a two way street.", "I wish. Here there are very, very few pet friendly places to rent. When I lived in Montana it was exactly opposite: VERY pet friendly.", "I'm not saying they shouldn't have. There should have been communications from both sides.", "Except, pet friendly rentals are nearly guaranteed to have residual animal dander. Unless it is a brand new build and these people are the first tenants, there isn't really a safe way to make sure that it is absolutely free of allergens. My son was severely allergic to animals (as in, his lungs would quit working because the particles got stuck in his lungs and between his asthma and his allergy, it was a fight to keep him alive). Thankfully, grastek has had the amazing side effect of vastly improving that. However, before his allergy improved so much, we ALWAYS made sure that we chose rentals that were NOT pet friendly, as well as requesting a history of the residence (sometimes people ban pets because someone ruined it for everyone....and unless they do a thorough clean of their entire hvac system, as well as replacing all carpets and their padding, the previous pet still has dander existing in that residence.) It's like letting a restaurant know of any allergens as well as ensuring there are no ingredients you're allergic to in your food (which we also do for my son's food allergies. We don't even go to seafood places when he's with us because he's got an anaphylactic allergy to shellfish.)\n\nIf you're severely allergic, you make damn sure there is no chance you're going to be exposed, and regardless of who currently has pets or not, in a pet friendly residence, you're still living with the history. \n\nI'm still not on OP's side, but I felt this should be clarified. As parents, my husband and I do this for our son while also teaching him for the future. When he's an adult, we'll expect him to continue taking these precautions because he will be responsible for his own health. OP is still a dick for knowingly exposing someone, as well as getting a puppy when they're planning to keep it shut in one small location. If they want to have a pet with smaller spatial needs, they should get a fish or a hamster or something.", "That 100% matters if the renters allow pets. Situations change and your roommates could want a pet or were planning to get one. You never know. So it's in their best interest to let all parties know that you have an allergy. They could have said that months ago.", "He didn't mention he was allergic...", "I'm confused. If the shared entryway causes his allergies, why doesn't riding in the elevator/stairs/hallways etc.? It seems like someone so allergic would avoid anything that approaches it.", "That's a super sad life for a dog.\n\nAnd very likely to result in a post 6 months from now \"my dog is so destructive and anxious, why?\"  Err because dogs need mental and physical stimulation.\n\nAnd four 20 mins a day isnt considered a good amount of time out of a kennel, wtf.", "But the responsibility is on the one that wants a change.  That's OP.  \n\nCould it have been *easier* if the roommate said something earlier?  Sure.  But that doesn't make then the AH.  \n\nOP is the one that had the responsibility to speak up if they wanted to change something big about living together.", "Yep, we found it difficult to get a pet friendly rental in the first place. I get that it may happen, but if I was extremely allergic, I would not be signing up to live in units where pets have previously lived.", "most people tour rentals and get to see the actual unit they'll be renting so they can tell if they're having a reaction in the space or not\n\nand between an apartment being professionally cleaned and changing the HVAC filter (and making sure you use a good allergen filter), that takes care of most problems. you can also run additional air filters on top of that\n\npet dander doesn't permanently scar a building, especially if the apartment you've chosen doesn't have carpeting and has a good modern HVAC system\n\nthere's also a huge difference between being so allergic that a dog in your shared space can send you to the hospital, and being so allergic that you cannot be in any room in which a pet has ever existed. lots of people have severe allergies that fit the former, but not the latter\n\nthe amount of due diligence that people with allergies have to do varies on the person and their allergies. there's no reason to assume OPs roommate didnt do enough due diligence in some other area and that the apartment would cause issues for him. you have no idea what he checked, asked about, etc\n\nit wasn't on him to tell his roommates in advance of his allergies because his roommates didn't have any pets and you don't just bring a pet into a shared living situation without clearing it with your housemates", "I was questioning if his allergy was as severe as he says or even actually real due to him not questioning or bringing it up before moving in.", "Roommates aren't supposed to just get pets without permission from all other roommates.\n\nPet friendly does not mean pets are a likelihood. It's not on the roommate to disclose their medical history. It's on OP to ask BEFORE signing a lease how the roommates would feel about them adopting a pet.", "OP could have also mentioned that she was interested in getting a pet, but wasn\u2019t sure yet.", "Nope. If everyone moves in together without pets you can't just get a pet. In a situation with shared housing, everyone has to agree to the addition of a pet before it happens. Basic roommate courtesy.", "Imo, it does. It's a pet friendly place. Common sense says you will probably be exposed to pets either now or in the future. You have a responsibility for your own allergy. No one else. It's on you to manage it. You can't get mad when someone wants a pet when it was completely in the cards because it's a pet friendly place.", "Oh absolutely, it wasn't on him to share allergies in this scenario at all. OP is definitely the AH here. But you also can't always tell with a walk through. Sometimes you're fine visiting, but you can't stay in a space for an extended period of time. Regardless, anything like getting a pet, moving in a significant other, or anything else that would impact the others in your living space, should be a 100% yes scenario. Either everyone says yes, or you don't do it. And with pets, there should be a responsible and realistic care plan. For example, my husband isn't getting any reptile pets until his career changes where he's able to be home every day to care for it, because I'm not willing to be the backup carer for a reptile. For OP, a dog requires so much more space than a single room, unless OP is planning to work out of a dog park or something crazy that will allow the dog to get exercise and roaming space all day.", "Also there are a lot of pets besides dogs, and presumably any other pet wouldn't be an issue for the person with the allergy.", "ESH is an option and that's what I'm voting. Wrong decisions were made on all ends imo.", "YTA\n\nShould have indicated that you would be getting a dog before you agreed to become roommates. Then they could have backed out and you could have gotten a different roommate who's cool with you getting a dog.", "Yup. I think it's an ESH situation.", "> But you also can't always tell with a walk through. Sometimes you're fine visiting, but you can't stay in a space for an extended period of time.\n\nand maybe that's simply not a problem for this person\n\nor maybe this person did do extensive checking. maybe it's a new building or they asked about the rental history or they know from the apartment setup that they'll be fine. maybe they have already planned to bring air filters with them\n\nwe literally know nothing about the apartment, nothing about the due diligence this person did, and nothing about their allergy history\n\nI see absolutely no reason to doubt that this person doesn't know how to handle his shit. he's lived in his body with his allergy issues for 20+ years. why would I assume he's incompetent?", "I agree with the 'can't always tell on a walk through' point. I'm ridiculously allergic to animal fur and half an hour in a room with dogs sets me off. A quick walk through wouldn't set me off either. Op is deffo TA for not checking with everyone. If it was a singular self contained apartment, fine but a single room in a house??", "The roommate made absolutely no wrong decisions. They did not move in with people with pets. They are not the one changing the living situation that they all agreed to.", "Sorry, situations change. That's the way the world works.", "No, the \"way the world works\" is that you don't introduce a pet into a multi-person household without everyone being on board with it."]}
