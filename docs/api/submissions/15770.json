{"id": 15770, "submission_id": "1301zat", "title": "WIBTA for getting a dog in a pet friendly rental (that I specifically chose because it is pet friendly) even though someone I am sharing the rental with has a horrible dog allergy", "selftext": "Over the summer I [23F] got an internship  working for a really great company. The company is relocating me New York, and I will be in a rental \u201ctriplex\u201d  with other people my age who are working the same job. The place I am staying in specifically said they were pet-friendly, which was why I chose to live there. I should add that I will have my own personal bedroom on the second floor with a bathroom that I share with only one other person. Our kitchen is separate from the first and third floor kitchens, with the only shared space between the first, second and third floors being the entry and stairs. I\u2019ve been wanting a dog for a very long time, and I\u2019ll finally be financially stable enough to have one. I found the sweetest rescue puppy, and am in the process of getting him right now.\n\nI just shot a message to the group to let them know that I would have a dog, but that he would only be staying in my private room, and would be in the staircase/ entry when I take him on walks. A guy in the group said that he is extremely allergic to dogs, to the point where a dog even passing through the shared entry way will give him a rash, swollen eyes, and sometimes a trip to the hospital. He absolutely does not want me to have one. He lives on the first floor and I live on the second.\n\nI am getting this dog, there is no doubt about it. He\u2019s my dream dog. I have saved up for months to get him. I have a name for him (Dex!) and bought all of the supplies I need. I have also already signed the 4 month lease for the house, along with everyone else. \n\nHere is where people are saying I am the asshole. I think that since this guy is so allergic to dogs, he absolutely should not have chosen a shared house that states very clearly that it is pet friendly, or at least told everyone four months ago when we were all finding housemates that he was extremely allergic to dogs. I had not decided if I wanted a dog at that time either, so it at least would have prevented me from putting so much time and effort into getting the do I want now. I told him this but everyone else is telling me I am being selfish, especially since I haven\u2019t even gotten my dog yet and could just not get him. They say that i should have thought about that and asked before I signed thee lease, but I just assumed since the rental said it was pet friendly that everyone would be okay with pets. I get that this guy cannot control his allergy, and did not know someone would be bringing a pet, but I can\u2019t help but think this is because of his lack of communication, and not on me.

Even if it stays in your room. It's their house too, they have a say. \n\nSecond, poor dog. Being limited to only one room, except for walks, will make him a very bored dog. The dog deserves better than this. Wait until you have a place of your own where he'll have enough space.", "YTA\n\nYou don't tell roommates you're getting a pet, you ask if it's okay. This is a shared housing situation. There is no way for this to not affect them.\n\n>I am getting this dog, there is no doubt about it.\n\nThen find solo housing or roommates who are up for having a dog in the home.\n\n> he absolutely should not have chosen a shared house that states very clearly that it is pet friendly,\n\nNope. It's on you to declare if you have a pet or ask about getting one.", "YTA twice! First of all:\n\n> Only staying in my private room\n\nA dog needs a bit more space than that to be happy, I would reconsider whether or not you do have the necessary room for a dog. Secondly, and while I understand that your are annoyed at your roommate, if he truly has allergies to the point where he needs to go to the hospital then that should answer all the questions.\n\nYes, living in a pet friendly place with allergies like that is stupid. Yes, he should make people aware of them if they are that bad. But does that mean you can just ignore that? Maybe, but it will certainly make you the asshole.", "~~Is the dog hypoallergenic?~~\n\nYTA, if his allergies are that bad, then he will definitely have a reaction. If you want the dog that badly, move somewhere else.", "Okay, so you signed a 4 month lease, while not communicating that you were planning on getting a dog. \n\n>I think that since this guy is so allergic to dogs, he absolutely should not have chosen a shared house that states very clearly that it is pet friendly, or at least told everyone four months ago when we were all finding housemates that he was extremely allergic to dogs.\n\nSo you think it's okay for you to NOT voice your plans of getting a pet (not a service animal or even and ESA) but he needs to give you medical details of his life? When he was moving into a home with no pets? \n\nAlso, just because it's \"pet friendly\" doesn't mean you are obligated to get a dog or he would have to live with one. Dogs are one of many pets he could have lived with (cats, birds, fish, ferrets,) so you acting like this is a problem on his part is very ahole behavior.\n\nYou are the one changing the terms of your living situation with your roommates. They absolutely should be able to veto such a large change in their situation. When you live with housemates that's the part of the social contract you take.\n\nAlso, it sounds very irresponsible of you to adopt a young dog during a very important internship when you know your housing is not stable currently. \n\nPuppies are a hell of a lot of responsibility. And you bringing this dog into an environment where he's not even wanted is wrong.\n\nIf that guy is smart he would contact the rescue you're going through and tell them the situation so they'll deny your application. That dog shouldn't be in that house. \n\nYTA", "YTA. The rental is pet friendly,  which means it allows pets for pet owners, it doesn't mean you have to have a pet to live there, and your roommate didn't know you would be getting a pet when he moved in. \n\nBecause this wasn't explicitly agreed to beforehand, you're the asshole for getting a dog without all roommates permission", "Dont get a social pet like a dog if youre living with people who dont want it and youre planning on keeping it locked up in your nyc (aka tiny) bedroom. Thats not a fair life for a dog", "YTA - pet friendly or not, it\u2019s incredibly inconsiderate to all of your housemates for committing to a dog without the consent of everyone living there. \n\nYou might think the dog is only going to pass through shared spaces on the way to get a walk but did you take into consideration the sounds they make. How about when you\u2019re not home, will they have to tolerate the barking and howling if there\u2019s separation anxiety. The list can go on.", "YTA\n\nShould have indicated that you would be getting a dog before you agreed to become roommates.

You\u2019re seriously going to keep this puppy confined to your tiny NYC bedroom?", "Gonna go soft YTA. \n\nThis sounds like a summer internship, so I would just postpone the dog purchase until your back at your own place in a few months. This is the best solution anyhow, since presumably you\u2019ll be working and networking with your internship and you\u2019ll have no time for doggy bathroom breaks, vet visits, etc. It\u2019s also not nice to have a young dog alone in a small bedroom all day. \n\nApparently you\u2019re allowed to have pets in this apartment, but since it\u2019s shared, short-term housing, I imagine your roommates weren\u2019t expecting to have someone with a dog.", "Info: Why do you think its a good idea to confine a rescue dog in a room at all times unless they are going out for a walk? You do realize the dog will likely be unhappy.", "YTA. You\u2019re saying someone that has a dog allergy shouldn\u2019t live in an apartment that permits pets? That\u2019s borderline insane. And it\u2019s common decency to ask your roommates before getting a pet that will impact their own living situation.", "YWBTA. All roommates should consent to getting a pet that will live in a shared space. The guy is dumb for living in a pet friendly space, but that doesn\u2019t absolve you from being an asshole for knowingly doing this.", "I am a dog lover.  I am also allergic.  I have been giving myself allergy shots for 3 years now, because I really don't enjoy having a stuffed up nose and red, runny eyes.  I can suffer if I want to have a dog.  I have no right to cause someone else to suffer so I can call have a dog.  Yes you would definitely be TA!", "YTA. I have allergies. It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cbad\u201d allergies are. What matters is exposure to allergens. An allergic response is caused by a person\u2019s immune system thinking the animal dander is a danger and has to be eliminated. That\u2019s what causes all the allergy symptoms. It\u2019s not healthy or pleasant for anyone to constantly have their immune system overwhelmed by allergens. Imagine constantly having cold symptoms every day with no relief. That\u2019s what you would be doing to your roommate.", "YWBTA. Pet friendly literally just means.... pet FRIENDLY. Like, you CAN have a pet. Not that you're REQUIRED to have a pet and everyone who moves in will need to get a pet ASAP? Maybe he didn't have other options. Maybe, as you've stated, you did not disclose that you wanted a dog when the housing arrangements were being made. This is very obvious to me.", "YTA.", "YTA You have many years to get a dog in the future. It makes no sense to do it when, one you'll be putting your roommate into a health crisis, and two you won't be providing the best experience for your dog. Now is just not the time.", "YTA - you've decided you're financially stable enough to get a dog based on an internship and a 4 month lease? You know dogs love for 10-15+ years, right? What if your next place isn't pet friendly? Or the internship doesn't lead to a good job? You're not ready. \n\nAnd keeping a dog confined to one room except for walks is cruel. Be prepared for some really difficult behaviours.", "YWBTAH for getting a dog and confining it to one small room.  That's cruel, regardless of how sick it makes a roommate.  Its a real dick move to make someone sick in their own home and imprison a young dog just because it's something you've always wanted.  Don't be selfish and make others suffer--human or animal.", "YTA. You stated that their allergies could put them in hospital and you still want to get a dog?

Holy shit you\u2019re a huge AH \n\nAlso, the dog will only be staying in the private room? That\u2019s so cruel to the dog, how would you feel being cooped up in one room all day every day?", "YWBTA. I mean... c'mon. You're willing to put somebody through suffering for your own wants.

I chose to take in 4 stray cats but not when I lived with other people!", "I would not get a puppy in a shared living situation with random strangers.  I especially wouldn\u2019t do so if not all of them wanted to live with a puppy. That\u2019s a shitty thing to do to your housemates, and an even shittier thing to do to the puppy. YTA. \n\nI\u2019m also really surprised a rescue group would place a puppy in that situation. 98% of the rescues in my area won\u2019t place a dog with me because I\u2019m in an apartment and don\u2019t have a fenced yard. But at least I don\u2019t have roommates or live on an upper floor.", "YTA You are not doing what is best for you dog. This is not a suitable situation for a puppy.

This is an awful plan.", "YTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re sharing a house, you have to get all roommates to agree to getting an animal.

Why do all these people think it's OK to shove a poor puppy or kitten in to a single room all day? Seriously ITS NOT OKAY. ITS ABUSE. Dogs and cats need room, they need interaction, they need exercise, they need fresh air. Fuck you walk into my place there's no doubt that cats live here. There's toys, beds, trees, perches, caves, safe nibbling plants, and tunnels everywhere. \n\nThere's also an 80lb dog that has 2 beds 2 bins of toys, a big footstool in front of a window to sit at, multiple snuffle mats, and his own spot on the couch. If I'm gone more than 2 hours that I can't check in on him he goes to one of his grandparents for a visit. He gets 2  2.5km walkies a day sometimes longer depending on weather.

Have you thought about where you might live after this internship, and whether or not it will be conducive to having a dog? I feel like this may be a bit of an impulsive decision, and that maybe you should wait until you're in a more permanent location. \n\nHonestly, I don't think a NY apartment is great for house training a puppy. You have to walk them every single time they have to go out. And what kind of hours will you be working during this internship? Who's going to take care of the puppy while you're at work? When you move in 4 months, you'll have to start house training all over again. Puppies do puppy things for *at least* a year.\n\nI feel more sorry for the puppy than I do for your housemate.

Just because a rental is pet-friendly doesn't mean you can have a pet without agreement of your housemates and explicit approval of your landlord for the specific animal. Plenty of \"pet friendly\" rentals have restrictions on dog size or breeds, prohibit puppies, are only \"pet friendly\" for cats, or have other restrictions in place.

Only 8 hour days.\n\nAs far as the actual apartment situation, dude is either lying because he just doesn't want a dog around, or he's a complete moron. Allergies can be serious, and we should care about those around us, but on no planet does someone with allergies get to knowingly move into pet-friendly accommodations and then forbid people from having pets. In this scenario, the appropriate thing is for him to find somewhere else to live that does not allow pets.", "YWBTA for several reasons.  First, the person getting a pet checks with all the other roommates before getting a pet.  This should have been a conversation you initiated with your roommates.  Second, you should not get a pet when you're just starting a job.  You need to actually work the job, understand what the demands will be & what life will look like before you even consider it.  Third, do you really not understand how allergies work?", "ESH. Sounds like this may be your first big living in the adult world for real time. You are well within your rental rights to get the dog.

Or when you did decide to get one, told them before you made arrangements. I love animals and i know what it\u2019s like to want to own a dog\u2026 but also, you have to be considerate of other people that you\u2019re living with and can\u2019t assume that just because a place is pet friendly, everyone there will be okay with pets.", "NTA. If you can't life with dogs, it's your responsibility to not rent with roommates somewhere advertised as dog-friendly.

The company is relocating me New York, and I will be in a rental \u201ctriplex\u201d  with other people my age who are working the same job. The place I am staying in specifically said they were pet-friendly, which was why I chose to live there. I should add that I will have my own personal bedroom on the second floor with a bathroom that I share with only one other person. Our kitchen is separate from the first and third floor kitchens, with the only shared space between the first, second and third floors being the entry and stairs. I\u2019ve been wanting a dog for a very long time, and I\u2019ll finally be financially stable enough to have one. I found the sweetest rescue puppy, and am in the process of getting him right now.\n\nI just shot a message to the group to let them know that I would have a dog, but that he would only be staying in my private room, and would be in the staircase/ entry when I take him on walks. A guy in the group said that he is extremely allergic to dogs, to the point where a dog even passing through the shared entry way will give him a rash, swollen eyes, and sometimes a trip to the hospital. He absolutely does not want me to have one. He lives on the first floor and I live on the second.\n\nI am getting this dog, there is no doubt about it. He\u2019s my dream dog. I have saved up for months to get him. I have a name for him (Dex!) and bought all of the supplies I need. I have also already signed the 4 month lease for the house, along with everyone else. \n\nHere is where people are saying I am the asshole. I think that since this guy is so allergic to dogs, he absolutely should not have chosen a shared house that states very clearly that it is pet friendly, or at least told everyone four months ago when we were all finding housemates that he was extremely allergic to dogs. I had not decided if I wanted a dog at that time either, so it at least would have prevented me from putting so much time and effort into getting the do I want now. I told him this but everyone else is telling me I am being selfish, especially since I haven\u2019t even gotten my dog yet and could just not get him. They say that i should have thought about that and asked before I signed thee lease, but I just assumed since the rental said it was pet friendly that everyone would be okay with pets. I get that this guy cannot control his allergy, and did not know someone would be bringing a pet, but I can\u2019t help but think this is because of his lack of communication, and not on me. Am I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are an irresponsible ah.", "YTA because that\u2019s not how a dog should live. Having to keep the dog just in your bedroom is unfair to the dog.", "And if he has an anaphylactic reaction?

That person has to live there also", "YTA and clearly don't know enough about what a puppy needs to thrive to be getting one.

You need to first ask all your housemates if it is okay for you to get a dog, especially since none of you had pets when you moved in. You don't just research it, buy a bunch of dog shit, sign papers for a dog, and THEN just tell them you are getting a dog. That is really messed up. \n\nYou dog is going to need a lot more room than just your room. Dogs need to wander around and have space. What you are planning is going to be cruel to that dog.\n\nWorst of all, your housemate is going to get sick because of your selfishness.

It's valid to choose the dog and a different arrangement, but you can't have both.  If that means you're out a bit on the lease, well, that's the choice you've made.\n\nYou *are* being selfish.  Both toward your roommates (who do get a say in whether they share a home with a dog) and toward the dog.  One room all day?  And when you bring him through the house to take him on walks that'll *still* be more than enough to set off your roommate's allergies!

A rescue even more so. Presumably this is a Summer Internship, which means your performance will be scrutinized.

I understand your point on being pet friendly and whatnot but you\u2019re not thinking about what\u2019s best for everyone and for this puppy!

I think it best if you wait!", "YTA for future dog abuse. Dogs need loads of room. Honestly SMH!", "Your roommates should appeal to your landlord and see if he can revoke your lease.  The dog cannot be shut up into one room.  You want a dog, get your own apartment. yta", "> but I just assumed since the rental said it was pet friendly that everyone would be okay with pets.\n\nThis is where YTA. That's not how pets and shared living situations work. \"Pet-friendly\" means the landlord won't stop you, but it doesn't say anything about the other people living there being on board. For example, what if they chose pet-friendly housing because they have a dog, but are horribly allergic to cats? You should always discuss getting a pet with the people you live with prior to getting the pet.\nAnd as a small aside, how big is this single room you plan on keeping the dog in? How much time are you going to have to take him out? If i were the rescue you're adopting from, I'd have some serious concerns about his welfare if I knew you were planning on keeping him restricted to your bedroom.", "Please do not get this dog. \n\nI also live in a large city with a cost of living crisis that has lead to an increase in professional sharers. In cases like this all parties need to agree to the dog. Also, as everyone has said, you need to look into a doggy daycare or dog walker service for the pup.  \n\nDogs are expensive, please also consider pet insurance. If you had to \u201csave for months\u201d to cover the rescue fee I am guessing you don\u2019t have the money put aside if there is a medical emergency. \n\nMost importantly, a pet friendly rental doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can have a pet. I have applied for quite a few pet friendly flats and been declined by the landlord because they had other offers of people without pets. In general you will still need landlord approval and to pay an additional pet deposit.

This could be fatal.  Talk with the shelter.  See if they can find a foster for the next few months until your lease is up and you can find a new pet friendly place.  Also have you notified your landlord that you will be getting a pet.  Often there is a clause that you need to as the deposit is bigger, higher rent and move out cleaning fee.", "YTA", "Good God YTA.\n\nPlease don\u2019t come to NY.

It\u2019s not even a tough call.

If you get this dog, the person with allergies this severe told you that they could end up hospitalized.  So basically, this person can't live there anymore and will have to make new housing arrangements.  They will be homeless, on short notice, because you can't wait until the summer is over to get a dog.\n\nThe housing arrangements were made by your employer.  Are these your coworkers?  Do you really want to start the summer known as the person who has such a poor ability to play well with others that you decided to make another guy either deal with debilitating sickness, or lose his housing?  Because you couldn't wait four more months to get a dog?\n\nSure the apartment was listed as pet friendly, but most people living in temporary shared housing don't have pets, for a lot of good reasons such as dogs cannot humanely be confined to a single room unless they are tiny and lazy (a Boston is neither.  They are insanely high energy).   And you found the information that the apartment was pet friendly because it was a priority for you, but was this obvious to other people?  Were there other housing options available that were advertised as pet free, for the allergy sufferer, or was this the only thing offered by the employer?\n\nYou also don't know what this dog will do when you're out of the house-- it could very well bark and howl like crazy, or chew things, running the risk of you getting evicted or losing a security deposit, and making your housemates hate you in the process.", "Yes!!!", "Yes", "I think everyone else has covered why YWBTA, but I wanted to ask, do you all work for the same company?

This is a temporary housing situation for the internship, you\u2019re not out on your own so you have to take roomies opinions into consideration. You don\u2019t even have a full time job which makes me question if you\u2019re financially ready for this too, do you know how expensive one emergency vet visit can be???

Also having a dog just in one room in a shared space means the dog will hear what is going on and pet dander will get everywhere and they will want to go with you where you go on the house.

I've lived alone since 2019 so it's been a minute, but I always told roommates that my cat was my responsibility and I'd never rely on them to take care of her (but please give her all the hugs and kisses you want!).
