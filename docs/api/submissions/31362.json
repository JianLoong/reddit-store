It was about a week ago now. I probably wouldn't have gone without some of the advice I received on my og post so thank you :)\n\nI sat through the whole funeral but I left the wake early because it was just a bit much. I'm glad I went in the end. My dad said that he's really proud of me for going and he apologised for getting annoyed at me.\n\nLike the day after the funeral I started feeling really shit which was weird because I hadn't really felt anything until that but a few people in the comments said I would feel like that so I guess that's normal.\n\nI think that's it there's not really much more to update, thank you to everyone who commented on my post :]", "created_utc": 1700478070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zm1a7/update_aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_moms_funeral/", "score": 90, "replies": ["I'm so sorry you're going through this right now. It's a tough time all the way around. But I'm glad you feel you made the right decision in the end.\n\nFeelings will definitely hit you when you don't expect them to, some strong & some less so. It's important to let yourself feel sad or angry or happy. Unexpected feelings are your mind's way of working through stuff. My mom passed 10 years ago & I still every so often get teary or sad, usually when I see something that meant something to her. It's ok.\n\nHugs \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97", "I'm so sorry that you're having to go through this.", "Be safe, okay?
