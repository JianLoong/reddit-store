It was about a week ago now. I probably wouldn't have gone without some of the advice I received on my og post so thank you :)\n\nI sat through the whole funeral but I left the wake early because it was just a bit much. I'm glad I went in the end. My dad said that he's really proud of me for going and he apologised for getting annoyed at me.\n\nLike the day after the funeral I started feeling really shit which was weird because I hadn't really felt anything until that but a few people in the comments said I would feel like that so I guess that's normal.\n\nI think that's it there's not really much more to update, thank you to everyone who commented on my post :]", "created_utc": 1700478070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zm1a7/update_aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_moms_funeral/", "score": 171, "replies": ["I'm so sorry you're going through this right now. It's a tough time all the way around. But I'm glad you feel you made the right decision in the end.\n\nFeelings will definitely hit you when you don't expect them to, some strong & some less so. It's important to let yourself feel sad or angry or happy. Unexpected feelings are your mind's way of working through stuff. My mom passed 10 years ago & I still every so often get teary or sad, usually when I see something that meant something to her. It's ok.\n\nHugs \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97", "I'm so sorry that you're having to go through this.", "Be safe, okay? We're here to support you, and me too.", "You are going to have a ton of feelings. And that is totally ok! Please talk about your feelings & talk about your mom. We may be a bunch of weirdos, but we're also here to listen.", "I'm proud of you. That took a lot. I'm so glad you went. \nSending you all the love and hugs in the world xxxxx", "I\u2019m proud of you.\n\nThe feelings come in waves. It\u2019s normal and you\u2019ll learn to get through it. I\u2019m sorry again for your loss.", "I remember your post. I'm so glad you went. The whole situation blows, and I can't imagine what you're going through. It'll suck for a little while. A long while, probably. But just stick with your dad, don't bottle up your emotions, and just try to be brave and work through it one day at a time. That's all you can really do. I hope things get easier. FWIW- I'm really proud of you for going. I know it wasn't easy.", "My condolences.  Life can be hard, and take comfort that you did the right thing.  \n\nBest of wishes to you.", "I'm sorry for your loss, and I'm so glad you went to the funeral. I lost my dad recently, and I can relate to what you meant by how not going made it feel like she wasn't dead. Through pure chance, I never saw my dad before the wake, so I was grieving but able to loosely go into denial. Not to the extent you experienced, but I could pretend to myself that he was just on vacation.\n\nFor that reason, I knew I had to see him, to make it sink in that it was truly real. I knew I needed to see it so I could begin to truly grieve properly.\n\nA word of advice for the future: grief is different for everyone, and some days will be better than others. You're going to find a lot of little reminders in the coming days and months, and you'll find yourself triggered by the weirdest things. I got worked up over the cup my dad used for his dentures for some reason, and my mom ended up crying after watching Bubba Ho-tep because she thought dad would have liked it.\n\nYou'll also find some things surprisingly normal though. Don't feel bad if things start to feel \"normal\" before you feel like it should, humans are just incredibly adaptable. \"Normal\" is an ever-changing state, and we can adapt surprisingly fast sometimes to major life changes.\n\nI'm just sorry you lost your mother so young.\n\nEdit: One more thing, there's [an album called \"Clover\" on YouTube.](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAdwl9xZlNTB4pHCmi81eG2U_CB93Q5eF) It's a series of music videos about a girl whose grandfather died, and centers around accepting the inevitable without letting it beat you down. I followed this series back when it released in 2020, and after my dad died... Well, it took on a whole new meaning and comfort. The final song in particular, \"To You\", became my mantra during the days after my dad's death. I still say \"Sorry, miss you, thank you and I love you\" whenever I talk to him.\n\nSo, maybe the songs and videos will help you a bit too. And if not\u2014well, the songs are all pretty catchy anyway.", "I'm so sorry about your mom, and I'm rooting for you \u2764\ufe0f", "Just an internet stranger here who wants to send you such love. Remember whatever you are feeling is normal. If it gets overwhelming there's support and help if you need it. Be well.", "thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "thank you sm", "thanks :)", "thank you \ud83e\udec2", "thanks so much"]}
