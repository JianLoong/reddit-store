He tore it out, pressed it and framed it and brought it to the cottage to hang up. \n\nIn my opinion it is a decent sketch. But I don\u2019t think it deserves to be displayed here forever.  \n\nWhat annoys me is that he hasn\u2019t done much of the decorating in our house or the cottage, except this. It obviously means more to him sentimentally than artistically. \n\nHis ex came here a couple times and sketched this in a small notebook. I\u2019ve been here for years (we lived here during covid) and I have put so much work into making the cottage a home and inviting people here and hosting people here etc. \n\nI know it\u2019s ancient history, and I\u2019m definitely not mad that he has an ex. He\u2019s not even in touch with her. Idk why it bothers me so much but I can\u2019t really hide my feelings. \n\nFrom his side, he\u2019s like \u201cIt\u2019s cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nI thought it was, until I knew who drew it, which he didn\u2019t tell me until I wrongly assumed he drew it himself.

We also use stuff that my partner got for his wedding with his ex wife...again, no issue.\n\nI suspect you're more annoyed that you've been the only one decorating and his only contribution has been this particular sketch...and I can understand it rubbing you the wrong way but ultimately, it's just a small part of history and it seems fitting since it's a sketch of the cottage itself. I wouldn't make too much of it.", "Right now, I can glance over my left shoulder and see the wine rack my ex husband and I were gifted for our wedding. In my kitchen is a large Mackenzie Childs platter on display; again, from my first marriage. Guess what? They are just items. My husband doesn\u2019t care. I asked him and he said he didn\u2019t care; after all, they\u2019re just items. \n\nYTA. \n\nHave you discarded every single item you\u2019ve been given by previous partners the minute you entered into a new relationship?", "YTA\n\nHe likes the drawing. It's just a picture.", "YTA- you yourself admit he has no contact with his ex, based on what you said he just likes the sketch of the cottage. Grow up", "NAH. I think your brain is being an AH to you by making you dwell on this so much. Bear in mind that he took this one picture out of its context. He didn\u2019t commission her to make something new or invite her to visit, he found a collection of stuff and picked this one.\n\nI see it as healthy that he has this one small thing of value from his past. I\u2019ve had acrimonious breakups that have tarred over my memories from whole months or years, and I\u2019ve recently been able to remember some of the things I enjoyed about those people. I definitely don\u2019t want to be with them, but i also can stop demonizing them. Their flaws can eventually be forgiven if not forgotten. And there are things I like about myself that got lost in the animosity between us. \n\nPerhaps there\u2019s a less prominent way to display this picture? It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask him to take it down for a little while. Now that it\u2019s been an ongoing issue, taking a break from looking at it might do some good. You\u2019d be TA if you intentionally damaged it or threw it away, but that hasn\u2019t happened. \n\nFor whatever reason, it bothers you. If I were him, I\u2019d take it down for a while to lower the tension and be kind to you. Maybe there\u2019s something you two could create together or some way to display it that\u2019s less charged. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a little skeptical that you\u2019re being fair to him here. If he has been letting you do the decorations so far, and things only become contentious when he adds something he likes, maybe you\u2019re not sharing the space very effectively. \n\nAgain, I think there are NAH. He\u2019s allowed to like things more and you\u2019re allowed to like things less. The question is how to share the space.", "I'm gonna go NAH because you're entitled to feelings but I would seriously try to let this one go. I realize that this short post is very little to go on but my gut feeling is that he just likes the sketch for what it is- a representation of the view from that place. \n\n It would be different if he gushed about her or even made a big deal about the sketch being her work but , based on this information,  I think it's a lot more straightforward and less sentimental than you think.", "YTA. He's no longer with ex, hasn't been for 6+ years. He likes the sketch of the cottage it will be in and wants to hang it. He's wanting to contribute ONE thing to decorating a space he will live in. You are being controlling and insecure.", "YTA and you\u2019re incredibly childish. Also, you are absolutely bothered that it\u2019s by his ex. There\u2019s no way on earth you would be bothered if some random ex friend had done it. Grow up, please.", "NAH. When I first started reading this, I thought it was a portrait of the ex that got hung up! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nLikely, he just thinks it's a cool sketch. The sentimentality is for the cottage, not the artist.", "YTA \n\nThey are not in touch. It's literally just a nice sketch of the cottage.", "NTA - you're not telling him to throw it away but it doesn't need to be on display inside the home you've made nice.", "NAH, but you two need to talk. The \"supposed to not have a past\" is pretty passive agressive. It is great that he recognizes \"the look of disappointment\" but the way he reacted is a little unfair. See if both of you can rationalize the things you are feeling. NAH", "YTA Who cares who drew the picture, maybe he just likes it because it's his family's cottage? Can't imagine being threatened by a drawing.", "Yta", "YTA - I have stuff from my ex still, some of it is decoration. My girlfriend knows that and knows that I even have some fond memories from that time. My girlfriend also knows that I would never under any circumstances want to even catch a glimpse of my ex again. She doesn\u2019t have fond memories of her ex, but if she did I\u2019d be fine with her having them and having associated items.", "YTA it's a drawing of landscape not them kissing, your acting jealous and really insecure - you liked it before you know who drew it.", "Yeah, YTA here. I was in this situation when my wife and I first got together. She had a drawing hanging that was a gift from her ex who was an artist. She actually asked me if I was ok with it being up. I was generally ok with it, but since the drawing was of two robots, which were clearly caricatures of them, with him giving her a flower and hearts in thought bubbles, I was a little weirded out by it. Didn't help that he and I were of similar builds or that her family kept mistakenly calling me by her first husband's name (we looked alike).\n\nA decade later that drawing is now on the wall. It stayed packed away in during some moves, mostly because that box just never got unpacked, but we pulled it out and hung up to j the last one.\n\nYour scenario is a landscape line drawing though, not something that is clearly romantic which is why YTA.", "When asked if the sketch was cool, you actually thought it was a decent sketch\u2026until you discovered who drew it. Your post makes you sound hella insecure. He chose you. Not her. What is this really about? You do realize that taking the sketch down won\u2019t make you feel any more secure or make you feel any less jealous. If you feel like you need reassurance to validate your relationship, ask him for reassurance. It\u2019s better than getting into a power struggle over a sketch. \n\nBefore you come for me and say idk what it feels like, I divorced my ex years ago, and my husband has a few items from a long term relationship he had in the past. \nI brought a piece of artwork and several practical items from the registry I made with my ex. My husband and I don\u2019t view items from our past as \u201csentimental love shrines\u201d, and in reality I doubt your boyfriend does either. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t in love with his ex six years later and you need to believe that. \n\nNAH.", "I can understand you feeling weird about it, but if you liked it before you knew who drew it, why not display it? We have art that my ex did, and we\u2019ve been married 16 years- but it\u2019s cool art, so why not? I think this is more an insecurity issue on your part, and maybe some deep honest conversations about why it makes you feel weird, and hearing his side (which is likely \u201cI just like the picture, it doesn\u2019t mean I miss the ex, it\u2019s you I love\u201d) might make things feel easier on you x", "NAH you are allowed to not want reminders of your partners ex\u2019s around your home. It\u2019s clearly not the drawing itself that is bothering you but is who did it so think you need to have a talk with your partner, maybe do a new sketch together?", "NTA There\u2019s having a past and then putting it on display as something you have to see on a daily basis.", "It is a piece of art that has sentiment attached.  Get over yourself.  \n\nListen to the song, \u201cIn my life\u201d by the Beatles. \n\nPeople have history.  Respect it and honor it.  Don\u2019t try to make people you love prove they love you more -  YTA without a doubt", "NTA of course he can have a past but fors it have to be displayed in your shared home? I think my feelings would be hurt too if this was the only decorating he'd done. Bring it up to him that you're upset about it but specifically why. That it seems more sentimental to him than anything and that it's odd this is the only way he's done any decorating. Maybe he will react better to a full explanation.", "Tricky. A lot of commenters are right that it's just stuff. It seems like it's just a cool sketch of the cottage (reminder: the cottage being the thing he loves, not the ex). That being said, I get how our minds pick at things even when you know they aren't logical thoughts. If every time you see the sketch and think ex, it's gonna be a problem. How would the both of you feel about \"upgrading\" the sketch? Maybe commission an artist to do a better or larger painting that now your mind will say \"cottage\", \"us\", etc., and your boyfriend still has an artwork that speaks to him.   NTA if you communicate and try to work it out, but YTA if you let it build and it festers.", "Yta sorry it sounds like you have insecurities and you want him to throw out something he cherishes for no reason other than your jealous. This is an issue that you should fix within yourself. Perhaps therapy to figure out and deal with why it bothers you.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you are jealous of an ex.", "nta i\u2019d be a bit weirded out too", "NTA he\u2019s allowed to have a past but he doesn\u2019t need to hang it up now in your shared home, especially when he knows it bothers you. Plus if it was that important to him it wouldn\u2019t have been in the garage for 6 years", ">  \u201cI know you\u2019re not keen on it. What, am I supposed to not have a past?\u201d\n\nNTA\n\nHe can have a past. He doesn't need to display it on a wall.", "NTA. He should have the courtesy of taking it down or moving it somewhere else if he knows it bothers you.", "NAH", "Nta. He is not supposed to flaunt and honour his ex in your face. And your home. If he is still so hung up on the ex maybe he should go and make a home with her.", "NAH for now but he will become the AH if he insists on having it up. My ex and I used to have his ex\u2019s paintings and sketches up (she\u2019s a professional artist and the pictures she\u2019d done for him over the time they were together were cool af). However, if I\u2019d been uncomfortable with it, I\u2019d have expected him to put them away. You\u2019re asking for a reasonable boundary (even if it\u2019s irrational - jealousy never is, but it\u2019s an emotion we have to be willing to accommodate to a point).", "NTA I think I would be weirded out too, mostly because he hasn\u2019t contributed anything in the decor except this sketch. Petty me would take some art classes, paint a better version of the sketch, and offer it up as a replacement he can keep the sketch in a box if he is truly that into it.", "I think the drawing isn\u2019t the issue, it\u2019s your partner\u2019s seemingly total lack of interest in otherwise investing in your home. Putting up the drawing shows that he does see the value of this investment, but previously he\u2019s left the effort totally up to you. That\u2019s understandably frustrating, but you\u2019re not doing yourself any favors by not getting to the root of the issue.", "I guess im an AH too, this would REALLY bother me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
