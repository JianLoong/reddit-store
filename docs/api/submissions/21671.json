It obviously means more to him sentimentally than artistically. \n\nHis ex came here a couple times and sketched this in a small notebook.

We also use stuff that my partner got for his wedding with his ex wife...again, no issue.\n\nI suspect you're more annoyed that you've been the only one decorating and his only contribution has been this particular sketch...and I can understand it rubbing you the wrong way but ultimately, it's just a small part of history and it seems fitting since it's a sketch of the cottage itself. I wouldn't make too much of it.", "Right now, I can glance over my left shoulder and see the wine rack my ex husband and I were gifted for our wedding. In my kitchen is a large Mackenzie Childs platter on display; again, from my first marriage. Guess what? They are just items. My husband doesn\u2019t care. I asked him and he said he didn\u2019t care; after all, they\u2019re just items. \n\nYTA. \n\nHave you discarded every single item you\u2019ve been given by previous partners the minute you entered into a new relationship?", "YTA\n\nHe likes the drawing. It's just a picture.", "YTA- you yourself admit he has no contact with his ex, based on what you said he just likes the sketch of the cottage. Grow up", "NAH. I think your brain is being an AH to you by making you dwell on this so much. Bear in mind that he took this one picture out of its context. He didn\u2019t commission her to make something new or invite her to visit, he found a collection of stuff and picked this one.\n\nI see it as healthy that he has this one small thing of value from his past. I\u2019ve had acrimonious breakups that have tarred over my memories from whole months or years, and I\u2019ve recently been able to remember some of the things I enjoyed about those people. I definitely don\u2019t want to be with them, but i also can stop demonizing them. Their flaws can eventually be forgiven if not forgotten. And there are things I like about myself that got lost in the animosity between us. \n\nPerhaps there\u2019s a less prominent way to display this picture? It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask him to take it down for a little while. Now that it\u2019s been an ongoing issue, taking a break from looking at it might do some good. You\u2019d be TA if you intentionally damaged it or threw it away, but that hasn\u2019t happened. \n\nFor whatever reason, it bothers you. If I were him, I\u2019d take it down for a while to lower the tension and be kind to you. Maybe there\u2019s something you two could create together or some way to display it that\u2019s less charged. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a little skeptical that you\u2019re being fair to him here. If he has been letting you do the decorations so far, and things only become contentious when he adds something he likes, maybe you\u2019re not sharing the space very effectively. \n\nAgain, I think there are NAH. He\u2019s allowed to like things more and you\u2019re allowed to like things less. The question is how to share the space.", "I'm gonna go NAH because you're entitled to feelings but I would seriously try to let this one go. I realize that this short post is very little to go on but my gut feeling is that he just likes the sketch for what it is- a representation of the view from that place. \n\n It would be different if he gushed about her or even made a big deal about the sketch being her work but , based on this information,  I think it's a lot more straightforward and less sentimental than you think.", "YTA. He's no longer with ex, hasn't been for 6+ years. He likes the sketch of the cottage it will be in and wants to hang it. He's wanting to contribute ONE thing to decorating a space he will live in. You are being controlling and insecure.", "YTA and you\u2019re incredibly childish. Also, you are absolutely bothered that it\u2019s by his ex.

I was in this situation when my wife and I first got together. She had a drawing hanging that was a gift from her ex who was an artist. She actually asked me if I was ok with it being up. I was generally ok with it, but since the drawing was of two robots, which were clearly caricatures of them, with him giving her a flower and hearts in thought bubbles, I was a little weirded out by it. Didn't help that he and I were of similar builds or that her family kept mistakenly calling me by her first husband's name (we looked alike).\n\nA decade later that drawing is now on the wall. It stayed packed away in during some moves, mostly because that box just never got unpacked, but we pulled it out and hung up to j the last one.\n\nYour scenario is a landscape line drawing though, not something that is clearly romantic which is why YTA.", "When asked if the sketch was cool, you actually thought it was a decent sketch\u2026until you discovered who drew it. Your post makes you sound hella insecure. He chose you. Not her. What is this really about? You do realize that taking the sketch down won\u2019t make you feel any more secure or make you feel any less jealous. If you feel like you need reassurance to validate your relationship, ask him for reassurance. It\u2019s better than getting into a power struggle over a sketch. \n\nBefore you come for me and say idk what it feels like, I divorced my ex years ago, and my husband has a few items from a long term relationship he had in the past. \nI brought a piece of artwork and several practical items from the registry I made with my ex. My husband and I don\u2019t view items from our past as \u201csentimental love shrines\u201d, and in reality I doubt your boyfriend does either. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t in love with his ex six years later and you need to believe that. \n\nNAH.", "I can understand you feeling weird about it, but if you liked it before you knew who drew it, why not display it? We have art that my ex did, and we\u2019ve been married 16 years- but it\u2019s cool art, so why not? I think this is more an insecurity issue on your part, and maybe some deep honest conversations about why it makes you feel weird, and hearing his side (which is likely \u201cI just like the picture, it doesn\u2019t mean I miss the ex, it\u2019s you I love\u201d) might make things feel easier on you x", "NAH you are allowed to not want reminders of your partners ex\u2019s around your home. It\u2019s clearly not the drawing itself that is bothering you but is who did it so think you need to have a talk with your partner, maybe do a new sketch together?", "NTA There\u2019s having a past and then putting it on display as something you have to see on a daily basis.", "It is a piece of art that has sentiment attached.  Get over yourself.  \n\nListen to the song, \u201cIn my life\u201d by the Beatles. \n\nPeople have history.  Respect it and honor it.  Don\u2019t try to make people you love prove they love you more -  YTA without a doubt", "NTA of course he can have a past but fors it have to be displayed in your shared home? I think my feelings would be hurt too if this was the only decorating he'd done. Bring it up to him that you're upset about it but specifically why. That it seems more sentimental to him than anything and that it's odd this is the only way he's done any decorating. Maybe he will react better to a full explanation.", "Tricky. A lot of commenters are right that it's just stuff. It seems like it's just a cool sketch of the cottage (reminder: the cottage being the thing he loves, not the ex). That being said, I get how our minds pick at things even when you know they aren't logical thoughts. If every time you see the sketch and think ex, it's gonna be a problem. How would the both of you feel about \"upgrading\" the sketch? Maybe commission an artist to do a better or larger painting that now your mind will say \"cottage\", \"us\", etc., and your boyfriend still has an artwork that speaks to him.   NTA if you communicate and try to work it out, but YTA if you let it build and it festers.", "Yta sorry it sounds like you have insecurities and you want him to throw out something he cherishes for no reason other than your jealous. This is an issue that you should fix within yourself.

However, if I\u2019d been uncomfortable with it, I\u2019d have expected him to put them away. You\u2019re asking for a reasonable boundary (even if it\u2019s irrational - jealousy never is, but it\u2019s an emotion we have to be willing to accommodate to a point).", "NTA I think I would be weirded out too, mostly because he hasn\u2019t contributed anything in the decor except this sketch. Petty me would take some art classes, paint a better version of the sketch, and offer it up as a replacement he can keep the sketch in a box if he is truly that into it.", "I think the drawing isn\u2019t the issue, it\u2019s your partner\u2019s seemingly total lack of interest in otherwise investing in your home. Putting up the drawing shows that he does see the value of this investment, but previously he\u2019s left the effort totally up to you.

I'm willing to bet she would still have some feelings about being left to do all of the home making even if the pic wasn't by an ex. She probably wouldn't have said anything but it obviously bothers her a little, that original feeling of being upset at being left with all the decorating gets multiplied with the added context that the one thing he cared to add was the pic done by his ex. I agree that the fact that it's done by the ex doesn't actually mean much in terms of his feelings towards the picture/ex. You're being obtuse though to deny that that wouldn't cause some sort of question about why it's important enough to be there but your current partners feelings aren't important enough to help them by just taking 5 minutes to Google something. \n\nListen you think and feel what you want but I'm not gonna change my mind that it's not that much to ask your partner to care for 5 minutes about your feelings and just Google some random shit if it makes them feel better. Obviously you feel differently. I'm done reiterating the same point over and over. Have a good day/night.", "YTA for making it about the picture instead of what is clearly the real issue: \n\n>I have put so much work into making the cottage a home and inviting people here and hosting people here etc.\n\n\nYou seem to feel like your work is unappreciated and not valued by your bf. I can't tell if that's true or not from your post, but you need to acknowledge it as the real problem and tackle that. Think about it and whether that's really true. If so, talk to him about it. Point out the work you did and that it really matters a lot to you for him to notice and recognize what you did. I feel that way sometimes--I do ALL the work before my family travels. Dog boarding, laundry, stopping mail, packing the kids, making sure we all have sunscreen/meds/bug spray. I started to feel resentful about doing it, but then realized I don't actually mind, but I don't like feeling invisible because it seemed like nobody noticed even though they sure enjoyed not having to give a second thought to the trip until the day before. I wanted my husband to notice and appreciate the effort I took and say something like, hey thanks for making sure my meds were refilled because I would have forgotten, or wow we are super prepared for this trip, thank you. We talked about that and he took it to heart-- this last trip, he made sure to thank me in front of the kids for all the work I put in getting ready for the trip, and then they also gave me a hug and thanked me. 100% better. I know love languages isn't a perfect concept, but acts of service are definitely one of my main ways of expressing love, and having people recognize that helps me feel seen and valued.  \n\nIf that resonates with you, I think you should sit with it or talk to your bf about it. Don't focus on the picture. I think it's totally normal to keep something like that, especially since it's a picture of the cabin itself-- that's cool.", "YTA. My ex was an aspiring artist, and I still have a somewhat large canvas on which she sketched out  what was intended to be a painting of my cat for me. We broke up before she finished it and she and I haven\u2019t had any contact in almost 8 years. The piece is sentimental to me because it\u2019s a pretty great sketch of my beloved 17-year-old cat, not because of who drew it. I don\u2019t have a whole lot in the way of other decorations either just because decorating isn\u2019t my strong suit. \n\nHave you considered that the sentimental value to him is more about the subject of the art than who made it? \n\nEven so, nobody is a blank slate when we get into a new relationship. We\u2019re all shaped by the experiences we\u2019ve had and the people who we\u2019ve interacted with. You said yourself that he doesn\u2019t have any contact with her, so unless he\u2019s giving you reason to believe he\u2019s actually cheating, I think you\u2019re blowing this out of proportion. \n\nI AM more used to my LGBTQ circles where we tend to be friends with our exes though, so I could be biased.", "Grow up - it\u2019s art, not a naked picture of her.  YTA", "You're being unreasonable.", "Sounds like the little green monster is showing his face.  This is a drawing of the cabin the two or you share that has been in his family since he was young.  Move on.  He married you NOT her.", "YTA - i have so much art from my ex.  Am I just supposed to destroy it because we move on with our lives?  \n\nYour jealousy is showing, and it\u2019s not pretty.", "YTA. You liked it until you knew who made it? Seems like you are jealous indeed.\n\nIf it is actually nice, your husband has the right to think so, too, no matter who made it.\n\nA lot of men do not care a lot about making a room comfortable but will come up with some little thing that is cute in their eyes. Be happy it was not an R2D2 who is in fact an electric beer can opener. Or a stuffed fish.\n\nIt is much more likely the simple drawing of the hut makes him think of quietness and a life without mobile phones and that in his eyes it gives the room some rural charme.", "Exactly. OP said herself he tore just that one out of the notebook. He didn't keep the entire notebook. It's about the art, not the artist.", "Rather than worrying about the sketch, perhaps you should consider therapy for your jealousy, insecurity and control issues. The fact you're sweating this much about a sketch of a place that is meaningful to your partner because it happened to be drawn by his ex says a lot of things about you as a person, none of them great.", "I bet you're fun to date"]}
