{"id": 18408, "submission_id": "13u5qkf", "title": "AITA for refusing to take my spoiled little sister to the movies?", "selftext": "I, (17F) and my friends (All 17-18F) recently made plans to go the movies. We were going to see a by Disney (we are all movie/Disney fans). I was excited to see it, since I've never seen it before, only the trailer. Anyways, we were about to go, when my mom came back home with my little sister (14F) from one of her lessons.\n\nAs soon as she came in, she saw me and my friends were all packed up and asked where we were going, so I told her the truth. Big mistake. As soon as I did, she started being super hyperactive and jumping around and asking to go with us. I said, no, and that I was going with my friends, and we didn't have another ticket for her. She didn't like this and started demanding to go anyway. Now, a little backstory, my mom is a total pushover. She never stands up for herself, not even when people are yelling and pushing her, so naturally my little sister is a bit spoiled; she gets almost everything she wants, and when she doesn't get it, she gets something similar instead. I never got this privilege, since she only got a better job with more money once I turned eight or nine--she was too young to remember a life without it, while I was already accustomed to not getting everything.\n\nMy mom told me to let her come, but I refused and explained how then I'd have to leave one of my friends, which I wasn't going to do. I don't get to hang out with my friends a lot because they live in the next town over and I have school, and having a moment where all of us could get together like this was rare. Besides, my sister doesn't even like me or movies that much; she wouldn't enjoy it.\n\nNow my sister got really mad. She stomped her feet and snapped at me, calling me a jerk and how I was always so mean to her (mind you, we don't talk that much besides when we have to, despite my attempts to kindle a relationship). I told her she wasn't coming, end of story, and she started to throw a full-on hissy fit. She screamed and stomped on my foot (which gave me a pretty nasty bruise) and called me a b-word. I-and I'm not proud of this-told her to fuck off, because she \"certainly wasn't coming now\".\n\nI'll skip the rest of the drama, but she convinced my mom that I shouldn't be allowed to go because of my behavior, and my mom took away my ticket and told me that \"my behavior was inexcusable and nasty\". I snapped that I was nearly an adult, and this was the one time I'd get to do this with my friends for the next several months, but for once she actually stood firm and my friends all had to go home. My sister, nor my mom or I have apologized, and things have been very tense lately. I feel like an asshole and I'm thinking of apologizing for being a jerk to my sister, but I wanted to get someone else's opinion first. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the responses! After reading your suggestions, I've decided to add some more context to this:\n\n\\-My mother had me and my sister from an abusive, toxic relationship, and left a few months after my sister was born because my father (who I have never and will never talk too) broke my little sisters arm. She was fine, and when I asked her a few years back, she didn't even remember it, but that was the turning point. My mom ran away too another city and has lived in an apartment with me and her ever since. She is mostly okay now, but it made it hard for her too say no to anyone. I've tried getting her to see a therapist, but she has refused multiple times.\n\nIf you guys want, I will update on what I do next (:", "created_utc": 1685294113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13u5qkf/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_spoiled_little/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom and your sister are treating you unfairly, you don\u2019t need to apologise to them, they should apologise to you.", "NTA. Do not apologize. I would wait a day or so till your mom has calmed down and talk to her about it. Explain that sister doesn't get things just because she demands them. Ask mom if that works for sister why doesn't it work for you. If mom doesn't acknowledge that you have a right to to out with your friends without sister, just grey rock them.

You can acknowledge your reaction was rude while standing your ground on your feelings and why you didn\u2019t want your sister to go and how her actions were entitled.\nIf your mom doesn\u2019t respect your feelings and refuses to understand your perspective, you might think about what your days until 18 might look like. As others have suggested, it might be laying low and then going no/low contact as soon as you\u2019re able to move out.\n\nEdit: this is the 2nd post I\u2019ve seen today about forcing younger family members into an older group, and I just don\u2019t get it.

Not to mention punishing you for a temper tantrum by someone who should have learned to accept things at a MUCH YOUNGER AGE. \n\nShe has created a \"monster\" and can only blame herself.
