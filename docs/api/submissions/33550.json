Anne and Rick came over for dinner to see me. And Anne announced that she was pregnant with their first baby. (Our parents knew. I was the only one who didn't).\n\nI told her I was very happy and excited to be an aunt. And I hugged both Anne and Rick. I noticed everyone was looking at me a bit strangely and I was like what did I do. Anne said I didn't say congratulations. I am absolutely weirded out by this concept. So I said I was happy. What else am I supposed to say.\n\nHere is where I may be TA. I said congratulations you got a baby in your uterus. Anne looked at me strangely and asked me what TF was wrong with me. I was like what the actual hell is wrong with you since when does having sex and getting knocked up get a congratulations? Celebration sure, but congratulations?  \n\nMy parents said they were disappointed in me and Anne said I was a lost cause and wished my future wife a lot of patience which is weird in itself. Was it such a big deal? Did I mess up?\n\nEdit: In case it matters, I was diagnosed with ASD at age 16. My family never had anything negative to say about it though.

They\u2019re weird for getting so hung up on the word \u201ccongratulations\u201d not being said when you were clearly expressing excitement and happiness for their news. However, your attitude that saying \u201ccongratulations\u201d for a pregnancy is not appropriate is equally as weird. You may not see it as an accomplishment worth congratulating but it\u2019s still the convention/social norm in the same way that saying \u201cbless you\u201d when someone sneezes is even though that doesn\u2019t really make much sense. Not only that, but getting pregnant is not as simple as having sex and getting knocked up, as you put it, for a lot of couples. For a lot of people, getting pregnant takes a lot of planning, work, and physical and emotional stress such as going through IVF or other fertility treatments and when it finally happens it is a huge accomplishment worth congratulating.", "INFO: Did you say you were happy, or did you say you were happy \\*for them\\*\"?\n\n>I told her I was very happy and excited to be an aunt.\n\nIf you said \"I'm happy for you,\" I think that's basically fine.\n\nIf you said \"I'm so happy, I can't wait to be an aunt,\" that really makes it seem like you're centering yourself in their announcement, rather than the parents-to-be. And I agree that's ... kind of weird. As a pregnant lady, I wouldn't have said anything to you about it in the moment, but I would have found it off-putting.\n\nThere's no reason to be weirded out by the fact that people say congratulations to a pregnancy announcement. It's a huge change of life, and you're old enough to understand that couples who love each other (and couples who don't, and strangers) have sex. You don't have to make it weird. Everyone knows pregnancy comes from sex, you aren't pointing out something taboo.\n\nWhen someone you love says they're pregnant, you say congratulations and ask how the pregnant parent is feeling. If you genuinely believe it, say they're going to be great parents. Keep it simple.\n\nEdit: I also wanted to note that a reason you say congratulations isn't just because they \"have a baby in their uterus\"--it's because (assuming you live somewhere in which they would have a choice in their reproductive health) they have decided to keep it and become a family. That's a huge, scary decision to make and that deserves congratulations and support.", "YTA.\n\nThere is a time and place to be....whatever it was you were trying to achieve with your little whatever that was. Maybe you were trying to be edgy and cool, who knows, but this isn't your friends you are trying to impress. Clearly your family is used to your behavior and anticipated this, which is why they all stared at you.\n\nWhen someone announces they are pregnant and excited for it, you congratulate them because it's something that makes them happy. You can also congratulate someone for graduating high school, for getting the job they wanted, selling/buying a house. It's about acknowledging that something isn't about you, OP, and telling them you are happy they are happy and are getting something they have been excited for.\n\n25 is a little to old to not understand how that works. The 'congrats on the baby in the uterus' thing screams 'this isn't about me and I'm frustrated by that'. you don't have to like babies or kids or even be excited for your sister, but part of having empathy is being happy that other people are happy about something.\n\nI congratulated my neighbor and was genuinely happy for her because she finally was able to afford the lawn mower she had badly wanted. My brother graduated from a tech school and I was as happy for him as I was for myself when I graduated with my own degree, because I know how hard he worked.\n\nYou need to crawl down out of your own ass and learn to be okay with things aren't about you sometimes. Having a baby is a huge event and one of those times.", "YTA. I'm kind of wondering what is missing from the interaction you described because I don't see anything wrong with your initial reaction as you have described it, but I'm also wondering how you jumped to, \"Since when does having sex and getting knocked up deserve congratulations?\" It's just so bitter and rude.\n\nThink of it this way: do you celebrate your birthday each year? Using your logic, since when does existing for one year deserve presents and a party? Did your parents buy you a gift on your birthday? Why? Using your logic, what did you do to deserve it?\n\nA birthday is a milestone, so we celebrate. Buying a new car, buying a house, graduating, announcing a pregnancy, getting married... These are all milestones, right? Things we tend to celebrate.\n\nDon't get hung up on words of celebration. It's no different than saying happy birthday.", "\"Here is where I may be TA.\" yep. Exactly there. There was no issue with how you acted or what you said prior to this. And I'd say they're TA for weirdly demanding you use the word congratulations.\n\nBut then you totally overreacted and made a situation out of nothing. I don't know if you thought you were being funny or whatever, but here's where YTA.\n\nIt's not so much congratulating them for a huge effort in getting pregnant (although some couples have to go through a lot before they can conceive) but it's a big landmark occasion for a relationship. It's like saying congratulations when someone shows their engagement ring. If you want to break it down, all they did was stand there and say 'yes' but it's still  something you'd typically congratulate someone for.", "INFO: what is your general family dynamic before this conversation? Feels like maybe there's a pattern here.", "ESH. they\u2019re weird as hell for being mad about not getting a congrats. but bruh, you didn\u2019t have to be such an ass in response. you could\u2019ve just shown your honest confusion and been like \u201cdoes this not count as me celebrating you? why would i need to say something so specific?\u201d and if they answered something ridiculous just reply \u201coh, well i didn\u2019t realize how important it was to you. for me, this felt like me congratulating you.\u201d and just been done with it. but you had to go off lmfao", "See now I might of said, \u201coh hey good for you\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s awesome\u201d  \u201cwell done\u201d \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s not written in stone that you have to say congratulations.

They were weird for complaining that you did not say congratulations and you became TA when you answered the way you did.", "YTA. Reddit is the only place where it's considered even remotely normal to be antagonistic to couples who have kids or are expecting kids. What would it have taken out of you to say congratulations to your sister that you love for something that she's clearly excited about? Further, you being happy is not the same as extending congratulations. They're not asking for congratulations *about the sex*, you dunce, but for the fact that they are bringing a new human into the world and again, they're excited about it.", "OP... Do you want to have a baby one day ? If not, good. That's your choice.   \nYour sister did want it. That's her choice.   \n\n\n*\"****I was*** *very happy\"*  \n*\"excited to* ***be an aunt****\"*  \nThis pregnancy isn't about you OP, it's about your sister and your BIL. \n\nFor me, you were already TA at this point. \n\n*\"congratulations you got a baby in your uterus\"*  \n*\"what the actual hell is wrong with you since when does having sex and getting knocked up\"*  \nYou're reaaaaally rude OP. And you don't seem to understand that.   \n\n\nImagine, one day, you want to marry, or you got your dreamy job, and you're excited about telling your family about that. And your family don't give a sh\\*t. How would you feel ? Disappointed ? Angry ? Right, coz you wanted to share your happiness with your family and they crushed your feeling.   \n\n\nFor me, for all this shit, YTA !", "A heartfelt, sincere reaction carries far more weight than perfunctory, ritual verbiage.

Their fishing for more is rude and, I dunno, entitled maybe. \n\nBut you being weirded out by the concept of saying congratulations seems odd. It's a common phrase for this situation. Not sure how you reached your age being unaware of this. As well, carrying a baby long enough to feel safe announcing it can be a bit of a big deal. Lots of people lose them in the first three months, to the point that's it's common advice not to tell anyone until then in case it's a miscarriage. So while it's not like a graduation or similar accomplishment, it's still an important milestone. Going snarky about this isn't kind or polite. \n\nEveryone in this interaction managed to make it shitty. ESH.", "ESH you\u2019re 25 years old so this can\u2019t be the first pregnancy you\u2019ve ever witnessed you know damn well it\u2019s just common practice to say congratulations.

What is there to be \u201cweirded out by\u201d and what is so hard about the word \u201ccongratulations\u201d? That\u2019s such an odd hill for you to die on.

Congratulations is the normal response to an exciting announcement. You knew this, and purposely didn\u2019t say it. Your family was clearly anticipating some kind of weird response, and you gave it.

Having a baby is a monumental occasion. It should come with lots of congratulations and happiness. You only expressed happiness for yourself and the pregnancy isn\u2019t about you.

It\u2019s weird for the family to be so hung up on needing one word said but OP is being really obtuse over not using it in a perfectly appropriate situation. It feels like we might not be getting an accurate account of their reaction and they were quite likely not very nice about the news.", "The part that makes me pause is that apparently EVERYONE looked at the OP funny and her next comment was \"Congratulations, you got a baby in your uterus.\" Then she says to us, \"Since when does having sex and getting knocked up deserve a congratulations?\" \n\nIt makes you feel like MAYBE the \"I'm happy for you\" was disingenuous or that we didn't get a fully accurate retelling?\n\nI think only the OP can say if she conveyed genuine warmth at first, but either way, it sounds like she couldn't care less. It would bum me out if my siblings acted that way too.", "I agree it's weird that the family is hung up on the word *congratulations*, but the,  \"Congratulations for having a baby in your uterus.\" Puts this into YTA for me.  Especially since the OP's response was so much about her, and not about the couple at all.  \n\nI wonder if the OP had said literally anything else, if that would have been fine with them in place of congrats:\n-That's amazing! I'm so happy *for you*!\n- You're going to be great parents!\n- When are you due? Are you so excited?", "It\u2019s not an empty social norm.  The congratulations is a way of saying someone deserves the good thing happening for them. It\u2019s using the idea of achievement to give good wishes and support to the person experiencing something good.", "When did congratulations become a word solely used for some sort of an achievement you\u2019ve worked for? OPs logic is arbitrary af. It\u2019s a little weird that they expect a specific word (although I do know a lot of people who feel like saying a specific phrase is just politeness) but it\u2019s much weirder to object to it on principle. It\u2019d be like refusing to say happy birthday to someone because you don\u2019t think birthdays are particularly happy occasions, but you said \u201coh I\u2019m pleased you survived another year.\u201d Is she snarky at weddings too? Congratulations you decided to settle for your 73rd tinder match? \n\nI\u2019d go for YTA, simply based on OP being weirded out by the appropriate use of a word that they seem to be trying to redefine.", "What cracks me up here is that OP had the moral high ground at first...according to the Oxford Dictionary, the word \"congratulations\" means both \"expressing praise for an achievement\" OR \"good wishes on a special occasion.\" By hugging her sister and Rick and expressing her happiness and excitement, OP DID express her congratulations, even if she didn't use the actual word. \n\nShe could have put the awkwardness back on them by saying, \"What are you talking about? I said I was happy, isn't that the same thing?!\" But instead she had to make it sound like she deliberately avoided the world because she didn't think it was a congratulatory event. Weird, indeed!", "Agreed. \n\nSide note: the full sentence for after someone sneezes was \"Lord bless you before the devil takes your soul\" because back in the good old days sneezing meant that demons we're trying to possess you, and if you weren't blessed in time they would succeed. Nowadays we know that sneezing is caused by many things, but it's still polite to give a little \"bless you\" just in case it's demons.", ">For a lot of people, getting pregnant takes a lot of planning, work, and physical and emotional stress such as going through IVF or other fertility treatments and when it finally happens it is a huge accomplishment worth congratulating.\n\nI agree that it's a social norm to say congratulations, but this part doesn't really fit in this case. People don't usually *plan* to have a baby at 22.", "Well it is an accomplishment if the woman has issues getting pregnant.. sorry that wasn't eluded to here but I just felt that was worth pointing out as a situation", "I really think this is the critical piece here.  From their reaction, I really get the impression that she is known to be very self centered.  Their reaction isn't normal UNLESS this is typical behavior to have OP act like this.", "i'm really glad other people are noticing that the word \"for\" was suspiciously absent in the story text. it totally changes the meaning of what she said.", "How she worded the being happy is key. I haven\u2019t always said congratulations but things like \u201coh how exciting for YOU\u201d and different variations using happy and excited. If they struggled I definitely said congratulations because that\u2019s s bigger deal in my opinion. But definitely the delivery is important. It reads to me as \u201cI am happy and excited for me\u201d and that would be off putting to myself.", "I was thinking the same thing. There\u2019s a big difference between \u2018I\u2019m happy\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m happy for you\u2019, especially if OP doubled down on it when asked.", "I don\u2019t see saying \u201cI\u2019m happy to be an aunt\u201d as self-centered. It implies she\u2019s happy for her sister. There too many people projecting their wants and needs on what was said. I\u2019m terrible at speaking out loud. I actually practice what I say on the phone when I call someone because I know I suck at the small talk and what I should say at the moment. \n\nMaybe OP is same way. She said what came into her brain. Far too many people have unrealistic expectations to their news. Yeah, they are excited but should the whole world stop spinning because of their news? It\u2019s not like OP  said \u201ccrap! Are you sure you want the kid? Did you think this through?\u201d No.", "And congratulations is the appropriate word to show excitement for someone else. It may not be an accomplishment to you OP, but to your sister they are proud and excited about being pregnant, so congratulations is the appropriate word to use to express that you are \u201chappy for them\u201d", "This is splitting the finest of hairs, IMO, and I would find a person weirded out by this exhausting. Maybe it would be good for OP to get some space from her sister and family if saying she's happy and excited about being an aunt to THEIR baby makes her look \"self centered.\"", ">If you said \"I'm so happy, I can't wait to be an aunt,\" that really makes it seem like you're centering yourself in their announcement,\n\nThe families reaction reads like this is what happened.", "The more I think about it, the more I feel like OP is not only self absorbed, but also is one of those people who literally feel the NEED to be edgy for the sake of edgy. So they can go and tell all their friends how edgy they are, or have some excuse as to why no one likes them. \"Oh no one likes me because I'm too out there/edgy/ I speak my mind\".", "Ohhh good point", "This was my take. Immediately making it about herself, which if they\u2019re upset is probably not an abnormal occurrence.", "Yeah the baby in the uterus remark is so out of line for a 25 year old. I forgot she was 25. The whole thing sounds like it's written by someone who is 16.", "Deff get the edgy and cool vibes from OP.

That said, I think I see the dynamic here. My sibling, in a same-sex marriage, does this all the damn time. They are 29 and go off on rants about how stupid it is that we care about \"the straights and their breeding habits,\" then pretend all the snark is them having progressive opinions instead of being salty.", "OP is giving edgelord vibes and it\u2019s cringe", "Exactly I was militantly child free for a long time.

They blasted her for her vocabulary. She was happy, they seem to be more critical of verbiage than receptive to other people\u2019s happiness. \n\nI\u2019d honestly hate to be in this family. Everything is a word trap. Everything must be perfect. Honestly, a 22 and 23 year old conceiving isn\u2019t a huge accomplishment, nor is it the norm anymore.

It was weird for them to make a fuss over it as it was clearly implied from what was said. \n\nBut also, it's weird to refuse and be like, 'No, I'm not saying that'.

I'm also tokophobic, so even with being fearful of pregnancy, I would not have responded the way OP did.

It sounds like you just got out of high school not long ago.

I highly doubt that OP's sister and her husband were trying to get pregnant for ages given the sister is 21 and this was totally unexpected news for OP. OP's parents and sister are AH for getting so hung up on OP not saying congratulations specifically when OP had already expressed her happiness for the couple and proceeding to make negative comments about OP's future partner.", "YTA.  It was just a missed social nicety but it turned with your last comments to Anne.  Congratulations means you arr pleased for them to welcome a baby, as that is what it is about.

When she thinks back on this, she will be sad. Is that what you want for her? She probably wanted one of those cute announcement moments and what she got was...lacklustre and snark.\n\nI understand ASD makes this harder for you to understand and respond to appropriately however it's your job to work on that and not everyone just adapt to your behaviour. You are now old enough to do better. Your sister is obviously frustrated with you and has had a lifetime of being patient.\n\nYou can keep defending your position, or you can ring your sister and apologise and be actually excited for her and express that sincerely. Send flowers. Fix this. Don't miss out on key moments, and don't tarnish anymore of hers.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of deranged comment section is this? Why are people psychoanalyzing this much?

OK, fine, it's \"normal\" to say the word \"congratulations.\"  You might want to add that to your \"interacting with non ASD humans\" checklist  ;-).

I'm genuinely asking this as I don't see saying something like, \"Omg, that's so exciting!\" Or \"I can't wait to be an aunt!\" as de-centering their excitement as parents.

I suspect she was. ;-)", "The big difference is you said \"I'm happy *for you*, and excited to be an aunt\" and OP said \"I'm happy and excited to be an aunt\" and they are very different.", "For sure, and thats really bad on the parents, I have a child w a learning disability and I kept after it until I got an actual diagnosis, now hes getting the supports he needs in school. Just leaving it like that is seriously irresponsible on OP's parents part.", "Hahahahaaa!!", "lmao", "\"Everyone's Shit Heads\" is forever what it means now", "This is a dual empathy problem. Maybe OP's sister shouldn't expect an autistic person to change her whole personality to reflect social norms that don't make sense to OP?", "Why can\u2019t ops family just accept op? Why is the person with ASD , clearly struggling, being told off for not behaving like a neurotypical person?", "Non ASD people may think this, but 14 months ago I left a job because of my immediate Manager being firmly on the spectrum, was at 61 years of age & 100% clueless to social cues. \nI made a complaint (more drew a line in the sand) in a meeting with National Manager, our Project Manager & my immediate Manager & I could see the look on his face he was absolutely baffled by what I was saying even though I'd complained multiple time over the preceding 5 months. \nHe was an extremely clever man, but social interaction was not in his repertoire.", "People with ASD spend their entire lives learning how to navigate social norms. This applies to older generations who were diagnosed late and Gen z and Gen Alpha, who are more likely to be diagnosed as toddlers and young children. Dealing with the intricacies of social norms can be difficult for neurotypical individuals; they vary by family, region, religion, culture, country, and language. \n\nSocial norms constitute an enormous number of the posts on this sub.  They're difficult for all but the most intuitive because they are ever-changing, both due to societal norms changing, and due to the changes between cultures. I'm part of a small group of online friends that have known each other for 20 years and we still discuss societal norms because they can vary so widely even between different parts of the county in the U.S., and they can change substantially within a generation. \n\nFor those with ASD, societal norms can be a  constant daily struggle because they don't make logical sense. They can not be intuited by looking at previous situations. Each new situation must be memorized along with \"correct\" responses, to add to the script. When enough scripts are in place, mix-and-match scripts can be combined if situations are similar enough.*\n\nBut you definitely can't assume that people are all able to function within societal norms by the time they're adults. It just doesn't work like that. \n\n*Every individual's situation will be different and every individual with asd will learn and interact differently. My description applies only to those who learn and interact in that way.", "I think it\u2019s probably more what others have said about there being context missing. Their response leads me to believe OPs attitude and tone are regularly rude and antagonistic which is why they assumed she was intentionally being passive aggressive by not saying congratulations. She basically confirmed that the lack of congrats was intentional when she said she didn\u2019t understand why you would congratulate someone for having sex. \n\nHOWEVER, you bring up a great point. When I was in college and in early adulthood, I had my share of social faux pas. I don\u2019t really know why I was so oblivious other than I was immature and selfish. Thankfully I was able to be honest with myself about it and make a conscious effort to think about and do things for other people over myself. I had to learn the behavior because it wasn\u2019t second nature. I would have greatly benefited from someone telling me little things that others assume are common sense but had never occurred to me. For example, when someone asks how are you, I would simply respond without asking how they are. I distinctly remember sharing news on Facebook without ever considering that I was stealing someone else\u2019s moment. I wasn\u2019t trying to do that; I was excited and it never dawned on me that it wasn\u2019t my news to share. That was at least 10 years ago, but I cringe and am embarrassed thinking about it even now.", "the initial response by OP was not\"congrats on having sex...the initial reply was quite nice, i thought it was enthusiastic and referred to op as being happy about the news.", "Then, congratulations", "They have pills for that now", "Lick rust!", "\"YOU GET MURDERED FIRST, ALEXIS!\""]}
