Not that it matters\u2014 but the way she\u2019s asking is so weird. \nIs she wanting to use your dog for some social media photo shoot or something? Not cool, and you should still say no, but she should be communicating what\u2019s up. \nSome protective orders have verbiage on them that include pets and companion animals, so if she continues to harass, there may be a way to not allow her within 500 ft of doggo, for example, but that\u2019s a legal advice question. \nBut yeah NTA, she\u2019s either being really sketch or just rude, and your gut feeling is important here.\n\nSave all the texts \u2014 meaning in a way that won\u2019t be lost if you lose your phone.

Why would someone (ignoring the fact she's your ex) need to borrow a dog for any reason? I highly doubt someone in your family or a close friend that you trust has ever done this.

It's a hard no and a good decision to block her.", "NTA- don't do dog visit anymore.\nMy gut tells me if you loan the dog, it will be hard to get the dog back.\n\nMake sure you microchip the dog and have it registered if you haven't.", "NTA. Her intentionally vague texts pretty much confirm she\u2019s planning to steal your dog.

I could see her picking up the dog if she also had one and wanted to take them on an outing to the dog park together because they really got along, but to take your pup to some random person's BBQ where you have no idea who else will be there, if there are kids around, if the kids will be properly monitored, people will know not to feed the dog to the point it gets sick, etc. etc. etc. is just a big fat NO.", " Who \"borrows\" a dog?

Red flag she is not giving a time for drop off.", "I have so many questions about how and when the dog was acquired, and what agreements they made. However, if it is OP's dog, they should not give her the dog when that is how she's communicating. It makes me wonder if she moved and is trying to steal the dog, frankly. \n\nWith that said, all these people are silly for telling the OP that you can't borrow a dog. Of course you can, as long as the owner is ok with it and the person borrowing the dog follows sensible care guidelines and makes sure the dog is having fun. \n\nI have borrowed my neighbors' dog dozens of times for hikes and outings - she loves it and her owners love it because they came home to a tired, cuddly pup. I borrowed another friend's dog for 8 months - she needed some obedience work and I wanted a dog to show, it was a win win for all three of us. I have lent out all three of mine to friends or neighbors who wanted to go on walks or hikes. The dogs love it! I'm not going to prevent my dogs from having fun just because I can't go. \n\nThe caveat is that there is a deep level of trust between myself and my friends, and we establish ground rules first...and I *know* that we're going to return the dogs to their owners. \n\nThis doesn't seem like that sort of situation.", "NTA\nShe wants to take your dog. If you let her take it from your home, you would be giving it away.\n\nI hope you keep her blocked and move on. Letting her visit has only fueled her desire to have that particular dog.", "NTA, you will not get that dog back", ">Someone isn\u2019t dead to you just because you aren\u2019t having sex with them anymore\n\nThis isn't what I said. You're trying to characterize what I said as saying his ex serves no purpose because she isn't giving him sex. No. A relationship is more than just sex. If two parties choose to dissolve that bond, there is no reason to entangle themselves with each other any further.\n\nOP found that out the hard way and came to the same conclusion, didn't he?", "Again, countless people maintain healthy and happy relationships with their exes. This includes both parents that happily work together to co-parent after a split or those who just decided the romantic part of their relationship was over.\n\nI\u2019m close with one of my exes, my current wife is also close with her. Sometimes the romance doesn\u2019t work out but that doesn\u2019t mean that person wasn\u2019t a good person and you can\u2019t maintain a relationship.\n\nIf you want to get hung up on a parting joke I made instead of the actual point, go for it."]}
