A lease can say whatever the landlord wants to put in there, but dictating the duration of guests is unenforceable.\n\nBut sure, entirely possible that's not the case in the UK, even the pet thing I mentioned differs in other parts of Canada.\n\nI don't disagree that it's unfair, just entirely permitted where I'm at.

Unfortunately most people on a lease are jointly and severally responsible, so even if he's on the lease, that doesn't force him to pay per se. But a landlord-approved sublease would be recourse to take him to civil court after the fact, and the sublease would specify he owes 1/3 of rent, must do 1/3 of chores, must work from the office, or whatever other conditions you want him to agree to for the favor of living with you.  You can also make one last plea to have the friend sign you off this lease and add the boyfriend; it might work, if he really balks at the idea of having to work from the office, say.
