For context, our rent is \u00a31000 split between us and the bills are only around \u00a3300 total so he would be paying \u00a3100 of our total \u00a31300 rent/bills. His job also involves constant loud calls, so I'd struggle working from home at the same time due to the noise. He would be sharing a bedroom with her and there is a spare smaller bedroom, currently used as a dressing room, that was offered for him to use as his office which he refused.\n\nWhen I said that I would be fine with him moving in on the condition he pays one third of the rent, both my roommate and her boyfriend have become very standoffish and have sent me messages where they've essentially said:\n- I'm a hypocrite because I lived at my aunties house during COVID lockdown rent free (when my plans to move in somewhere fell through on the day, with all of my things in the van)\n- I spend a lot of time at my boyfriends anyway so why do I even care if he moves in?\n- I've personally affronted them by suggesting that he pays a third of the rent \n- made me out to be greedy and putting money above my friendship with both of them\n- the weirdest part is they both have this stance of suggesting that I'm \"going through something mentally\" and that by doing this I'm pushing them and all my friends away? they've also both condescendingly wished me luck in getting through whatever I'm going through and hoping I get better soon.\n\nI've offered to vacate my part of the tenancy so he can move in with her and I can move in with my boyfriend but they're not interested in that either, even though that way they both get to live together and I can remove myself from this situation that has gotten very uncomfortable.\n\nAnother important note is that the boyfriend has a very well paying job, and is from a wealthy family and is in no way struggling financially. If he were to move in I'd be earning the least out of everyone there. Even if he were to move in and pay 1/3 of the rent, he would still be paying less than he did for his previous house, and more than likely less than any other place he could find in the area we live.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691240397, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15iv3nb/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_if_she_wants/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to check the terms of the lease first though. \n\nThe boyfriend has added expenses from utilities to food to the use of cutlery, utensils and toiletries.  He is also putting added wear and tear on the leased property, which is what the bulk of a lease expense covers.  \n\nHe should be paying his share for those uses.

Hold your ground.", "Lol NTA; they are trying to screw you over and freeload \n\n\nMove with your boyfriend", "NTA and they are not your friends. The actions they have taken and methods used are not typical of people that care about you.", "NTA. You agreed to live with one roommate and now suddenly they want to make it two. You even offered to move out yourself! They just want you to subsidize their place for them.", "NTA. Maybe tell them that you like their idea of someone being able to live in the house as a roommate without having to pay rent so much that you are going to do this yourself, and from now on, you will only be pitching in a few bucks here and there for utilities. \n\nI'm sure they'll think that's totally fine and fair.", "NTA. You signaled openness to the boyfriend even entering the home, when you could have simply said No.", "NTA\n\nContact the landlord and ask if you can transfer your part of the lease to the boyfriend. You can't just leave - if you have a lease you're obligated to pay your share until the lease expires. To break a lease in many US States, you are only on the hook for three months. \n\nSo, if you are able to move, you can inform the roommate/boyfriend (AFTER you've packed and are ready to go) that you are moving, and your roommate broke her agreement by moving in the boyfriend and then creating a hostile living environment. \n\nIf the boyfriend still won't pay, then take your roommate to small claims court. The agreement was with her, not him, and she will need to cover your 3 month broken lease responsibility to the landlord. I would file that so fast to make her head spin.\n\nAt least now you know where your \"friendship\" stands.", "NTA. Figure out how to vacate the tenancy without incurring a financial punishment.", "NTA. He should pay 1/3 of the rent.", "NTA\n\nIf he moves in, the rent needs to be split three ways. They're trying to freeload off you. Don't agree to letting him move in unless all rent and bills are split three ways for the remainder of the lease, **which you should get in writing before he moves in**. \n\nYour counter offer for you to move out and him to take over your part of the lease (paying half instead of 1/3) is also perfectly fair. The fact that they won't accept it shows that they just want to freeload. Don't let them push you around. All their excuses and gaslighting are ridiculous and are just them trying to get out of paying what he should be paying.", "If he would have access to the house 24/7 during those 6 months, then he needs to pay rent.\n\nThats what rent is for.  You pay the landlord so thst you have access to the property.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Permanently residing with you will be inconvenient and raise costs. You living rent free at your aunt\u2019s place is not comparable because the people who lived there AGREED to have you there without asking you to pay. Saying you should cope by spending time at your boyfriend\u2019s is rude because you\u2019ll still be paying her boyfriend\u2019s way. On top of that they\u2019re gaslighting you.

I don't think any of you are in the right. They would be sharing a bedroom so it'd not be fair to ask him to pay full third of the rent. He does need to pay though as he will be using the shared spaces and resources. Maybe figure out a rate for the bedrooms and shared spaces, and calculate fair rent from that (they pay for one bedroom together and you pay for your bedroom, and then the rent for the shared space gets divided in three), and naturally you each should pay an equal share of the utilities. \n\nIf you cannot come into an understanding, it'd be fair to just veto him moving in alltogether, imo.", "NTA - why should you have to subsidize them.", "NTA. But maybe you should move in with your boyfriend or somewhere else anyway. Do you really want to stay with people like that who become so hostile for such a reasonable demand?", "NTA, you might want to look into removing yourself from the rent agreement with the landlord and also from the house, he is planning to use you and to a lesser degree his girlfriend.", "Tell them that he pays 1/3rd of everything or that he doesn't move in.\n\nNTA", "NTA. They are trying to take advantage of you. Insist he pays rent or insist that you should move out and they can pay the full rent. \n\nThey are avoiding every reasonable solution to this so it\u2019s a fact that they just want to take advantage of you for cheap rent as long as they can. \n\nI\u2019m guessing he might also be planning to \u201cpay\u201d rent, but I\u2019m sure they are just taking your roommates half and splitting it between them. Then she gets cheaper rent too, subsidized by you!", "NTA\n\nIf your bf is completely fine with you moving in then you should be completely fine with leaving these condescending gits in la-la land.", "NTA. Living with your aunt rent free in the past has eff all to do with this situation. Is it a two bedroom place where he'd be sharing the room with your roommate? He's using common areas so he should pay some rent. Maybe 40% you if you get your own room and 60% the two of them together? A speck more for you to have your own space?", "NTA, it\u2019s amazing the stretch people can make when they want something for nothing, the solutions you\u2019ve offered are completely reasonable, they just don\u2019t want to pay.", "> *\"Some serious manipulation going on here\"*\n\nExactly what's going on. A man who is almost 30 trying to mooch off his younger girlfriend and roommate. What a deadbeat.", "It feels super gaslighty. I feel like this is going to be a massive problem for OP however it is resolved.", "She's paying 50% not 66.66%."]}
