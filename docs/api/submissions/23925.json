I would divide it by square footage usage. Roommate/boyfriend get to split the cost of the shared bedroom, but all common spaces are split in thirds.", "Your bills are only 300?  Do you not use leccie?", "1/3 of the rent to share a bedroom doesn\u2019t seem fair to me but just 1/3 of the utilities also doesn\u2019t seem fair to me. The right answer is probably somewhere in the middle.", "Since they are in one bedroom and sharing that I don't think them paying 2/3 of the rent us totally fair but I do think they should be paying more than half. Can't you guys come to a middle ground and instead have them pay 60% vs 66% of the rent?", "Rent should be divvied by room, not by person.", "So you think he should pay 1/3 of the rent without taking up 1/3 of the space? If it were a third roommate with their own room, I'd agree with you. But the roommate and the bf will be sharing a room, so essentially your roomates bedroom is now going to cost extra?\n\nI think he should pay for 1/3 of all the bills. I'm not sure it's fair for him to pay 1/3 of the rent, though, since he's not getting his own 1/3 of the flat/apartment/house.", "YTA but only because they were sharing a room. You dont charge extra rent for the same space. Splitting utilities 3 ways would make total sense but unless they also were getting a 2nd equally sized room for him to use, asking for additional rent is absurd. That said you are absolutely entitled to break your lease whenever and let them figure it out. Just be aware that your expectation here is the odd one out.", "It depends on whether the lease is by room or by tenant.", "Stick to your guns.", "I see this happen time and time again with roommates. I think such activities should actually be written into contracts it is so common. \n\nYou are NTA and they are freeloading. It's not just utilities they will increase. You have to share your resources with another person. You have to share the living room, the parking, your time in the bathroom, your liability, etc.", "NTA You'd be increasing the apartment population by 50%, he should absolutely pay rent. They are seriously trying to use you.", "Regardless of his resources he sounds like a freeloader to me and his twin soul, miss I don't respect my roommate, is a match made in trashland. And why are they bringing up your aunt? That's your blood relative and has nothing to do with this matter.  You offered to move, and they still don't agree? So what is it other than just being cheap and unreasonable? \n\nThis is why roommates must have their own contract and have a stipulation on guests, family and partners and how long they can stay rent free before the tab starts.", "NTA, the are absolutely trying to take advantage of you, and their 'reasonings' are sick, frankly. They are trying to manipulate you into folding so they can be cheap.\n\nThis friendship, at the very least, is over because she SUCKS.\n\nI would honestly be looking out at moving earlier, breaking the lease if possible and not paying rent anymore. Stop asking. They aren't asking, they are demanding. You need to look out for yourself and get out of this situation with these two users.", "They sound like complete assholes and I would try to break the lease because it's not what you signed up for.", "Done\u2026\u2026.upvote back", "I was going to say that the boyfriend is a rich mooch\n\nThe type to have money but pretend he is suffering and freeload of friends \n\nOpie, time to move out, stay with your boyfriend, they are essentially gaslighting you in to agreeing. NTA", "Check your lease, this is probably against it for him to live there this much, see what your landlord think about this I bet they will have a negative view on this. After all it isn't like he is only in her bedroom, he will be in common spaces all the time also.\n\nNTA", "Yup. Tell them either rent is split three ways or you live with your boyfriend and they can take care of all the rent. Period.", "This! Many leases are signed by the people actually living there and in many places if he did not sign the lease then he cannot live there. You can bring it up to the landlord that someone not on the lease is living there. They signed it to you two. They don\u2019t know who he is, they did not do a background check on this man, they did not agree he can live there, etc.", "Yes!!! This!!! Have his obligations in writing!", "This is so uncivilised - OP is NTA but would be if they did this", "BRILLIANT.", "Agreed. They are already pushing the couple dynamics onto you and gaslighting you to boot. Can you imagine if he moved in, how everything will be discussed, and decided? That's going to be a very uncomfortable situation. \ud83d\ude15", "OP should stop paying her part and when they ask to pay say they put money above their friendship. NTA", "Why's that? There's a third bedroom which he isn't taking of his own choice. He either pays a third of everything or he can stay where he is", ">ESH? I don't think any of you are in the right. They would be sharing a bedroom so it'd not be fair to ask him to pay full third of the rent\n\n\nYou mean it isn't fair to ask someone moving in as a roommate to pay equally? \n\nAnd even if not fair, it is also a problem for Op to leave? \n\nThey, not Op, need to figure out their shit", "You think his family got rich friviously spending money on things like rent?!?!?!  That's for the plebs... /s", "Omg i didn\u2019t even realize that he\u2019s older, he\u2019s definitely trying to take advantage of op and manipulate her", "Yes! I am not a nice person. I would shame the HELL out of this man, just for implying I wanted him to step up and pay his share because I had issues rather than because it was the right thing to do.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry that you're broke and can't afford rent anymore, but maybe there are some resources you should explore?\"\n\n\"You know, you'd think at your age you'd have it more together financially and be able to pull your own weight. I sure hope [roomie] doesn't drop you for someone who can actually support himself.\"\n\n\"Sorry, I'm saving for [thing]. My budget doesn't allow for supporting a grown man who shouldn't be mooching off two young girls.\"\n\nRinse, repeat.\n\nNTA, but I sure would be one.", "Uncivilized is moving in against her wishes as a paying tenant and demanding he be able to freeload. Holding an adult responsible for breaking a contract is not. I completely disagree with your comment and hopefully everyone else does too.", "Uncivilized is squatting in someone's house who doesn't want you there and having your SO attempt to gaslight them into thinking it's okay. \n\nIf you live in a house that's not yours, then you pay rent, or make another arrangement. \n\nThe guy has a job, he can get a place to live that isn't with the OP.", "What is uncivil about ANYTHING I said?", "The old 2 against 1", "No, it's not when those people will be sharing a bedroom. It's fair to pay for joint space equally, but why should people sharing a bedroom pay the same amount as someone who has a bedroom for themselves?  \n\nSo as I wrote above, none of them are in the right in their demands, imo. OP would be crazy to allow the roommate's bf to move in without a change into her share of the rent, but her demand isn't fair either. Not knowing the structure of the apartment, maybe the correct percentage might be 40 for OP and 60 for the couple, or not. Or maybe OP can negotiate the percentages to 1/3 each as she is wanting right now citing the noice inconvenience the bf will cause. Easiest would just be to veto the whole move-in (which I might do personally).", "**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H27rfr59RiE**", "Absolutely, and op would lose everything time!"]}
