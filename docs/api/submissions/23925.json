Must be an abusive situation.", "The lease can say whatever they want, but I'd double-check what's actually enforceable. No, you can't \"add a roommate\".  But can you have a guest? For how long?\n\nI can't speak for the UK either, nor the US, hence my mentioning that it's certainly going to be regional, but where I'm at in Ontario there's not a damn thing they could do to enforce that. They can't dictate whether you can have guests, and there are no grounds for trying to argue the matter to establish a \"guest\" as a separate tenant.\n\nYou're the tenant, you have a guest, and you're responsible for anything they fuck up, but that's the end of it.", "What a lease says is different than what a landlord can actually enforce (and within 6 months at that)\n\ni.e. Here a lease can say \"no pets\", and then you get a pet, and tenancy laws say the landlord can't do a goddamn thing about it.\n\nGuests are the same. A lease can say whatever the landlord wants to put in there, but dictating the duration of guests is unenforceable.\n\nBut sure, entirely possible that's not the case in the UK, even the pet thing I mentioned differs in other parts of Canada.\n\nI don't disagree that it's unfair, just entirely permitted where I'm at. Certainly worth checking in any case.", "Oh I don't doubt that they'll want more rent and might ask, but whether that's something they have any grounds to enforce, you'll want to look it up.\n\nWhere I'm at in Canada they can't enforce a damn thing regarding pets nor guests. In other parts, they can restrict pets, but I'm not aware of anywhere that can dictate what you do with guests. \n\nAnd again, that still leaves the timeframe. Even if you're blatantly in violation of something actually enforceable under your local tenancy laws, can your landlord actually get whatever local regulatory body to sign off on additional charges or eviction in less than the 6 months where they're going to be gone anyways?", "I think part of talking to the landlord is seeing if your name can be taken off the lease", "Exactly. You get the spare room, we all split it evenly. Especially if he works from home, he will be dominating every space (and more than 1/3 of the utilities).", "And if he takes it then he should pay for it, but if he doesn't then it's another common space.\n\nOP of course retains the right not to let someone move in with her for whatever reason she wants, but there's a reasonable way of discussing a fair rent split.", "Nah I disagree, roommate is changing the original agreement by wanting to move boyfriend in, the guy works from home too so it's not like OP will even have comfortable use of her home when she's got time off.\n\nTo say that he shouldn't be paying an equal amount of rent when he'll be using everything like the bathroom, kitchen, living room etc is ridiculous. He might be moving into an already occupied bedroom, but everything else he'll be using an equal share of.", "> Who said that OP has to pay more?\n\nOP's flatmate and her BF \u2013 and, in effect, you \u2013 are saying OP has to pay more than she should if everyone pays a fair third of the rent. HTH!", "Ah, I totally missed the separation of the rooms and the common space.", "Most leases specify how long a guest can stay so they can\u2019t establish residency/ squatters rights. Mine personally is 5 days. A lease is also still a binding legal contract (with the possible exception of a landowner leasing their own property without help from a leasing agency, but most US courts would still uphold the lease as long as there isn\u2019t anything too far out in it (ie eviction with no notice, rent subject to change, tenant responsible for maintenance/repairs to appliances). Here in the states rent can vary depending on how many adults are living in the unit and all tenants have to qualify to pay rent individually, which means they have to make 2.5-3x rent (unless they are legally married, then the couples joint income would count as 1).", "That's the proper way to go about it.\n\n\"Just tell the landlord and ghost\" isn't how that works."]}
