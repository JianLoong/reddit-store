I am in school working on a certification to improve my options, but all of the money I get is going to bills, rent, and groceries. This is something that is pretty well known in my friend group.\n\nBecause of my financial situation, I\u2019ve been pretty transparent with my friends that I\u2019ll be crocheting them gifts for the holidays (I have tons of yarn already on hand) and I don\u2019t expect anything of anyone because times are tough for most of us right now. \n\nMost of my friends are completely cool with this, partly because crocheting has been my side hustle for years and they know how much time and effort I put into these projects. But one friend (we\u2019ll call her Ann) gave some pushback regarding me making her and her child (1m) anything.\n\nI\u2019d asked Ann if her kiddo needed any warm clothes, blankets, or plush toys and she said to look at the registry she has open still from his birthday. I explained that as much as I\u2019d love to buy off the registry for Christmas, fiscally it isn\u2019t something I can do, and I was planning to make gifts this year. She argued if I\u2019m not buying gifts for anyone else I should \u201ceasily be able to buy gifts\u201d for her son AND her. I tried to reiterate that I cannot afford to buy gifts, but she waved me off saying I was \u201cbeing difficult.\u201d\n\nThis really frustrated me, not because she didn\u2019t want me to make either of them gifts (I\u2019ve had some parents share concerns they have regarding a child having an allergy to something in the material, dyes, or just personal preference, all of which I completely understand and respect), but because she seems to feel entitled to being the only person in my life to receive a store bought gift.\n\nI\u2019m opting to not get her or her son anything now out of principle. I know it sounds petty, but if I were to get enough money for a gift for anyone, it would be for my SO or dad, both of whom have helped me get through this rough patch.\n\nI talked to a mutual friend about it and she thinks I\u2019d be an AH if I gave everyone else gifts but not Ann and her son, and that I should maybe try to just get something under $10 for each. I really don\u2019t think I should be obligated to spend money on someone who is being this entitled and rude. AITA?\n\nETA: Ann is married to one of my relatives (not a SIL, but 2nd cousin in law type thing), and is also friends with many of the people in my friend group. My use of \u201cfriend\u201d was kind of the short version, I typically limit my contact with her as it is. \n\nUPDATE: I spoke with her husband and explained the conversation with Ann, and he\u2019s appalled and a bit angry. He assured me the kid has no allergies and has crocheted items from Ann\u2019s MIL that he loves. He even asked if I could do a bear beanie for little one to go with his little bear onesie. So kiddo will get a handmade gift for sure. Ann\u2019s husband intends to talk to her about this, because they apparently had talked about a gift for me that, in his exact words, would help me out or would be very useful to me.

One person in the group shouldn't be setting the standard precedent for what you are getting everyone. \n\nPersonally I'd be thrilled with a handwritten note in a cheap generic card that tells me how much our friendship means.

Now I make bath bombs, shower steamers, soaps etc ( family & friends only) - but I hand paint specific things like Halloween & Christmas bath bombs. And that takes hours/days. It\u2019s not just the expense of the main \u201cingredients\u201d ( whatever you make) - it\u2019s the hours of time. \n\nThere are people who get it - that really appreciate hand made gifts and the time, effort and love that goes into it. \n\nAnd there are people who don\u2019t. That just think you\u2019re a cheapskate for giving handmade. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the expense of your main \u201cingredient\u201d be it yarn, metal, wood, fabric, whatever \u2026 plus your time - a lot of crafters I know forget to add in the extras - things like packaging for example. It all adds up. And people don\u2019t always appreciate. \n\nIf someone gives me something handmade - I really appreciate it because they\u2019ve put their time and effort into it. And as you said, often base \u201cingredients\u201d are expensive. I really hope you are able to explore jewellery making more if you enjoy it.", "Sounds similar to the UK.  We have 'Poundstretcher' which has cheap stuff but at a variety of prices, and 'Poundland' where you have more items priced at \u00a31.  But in both cases you need to check against regular stores as sometimes the 'cheap' items are not good value for money.", "I\u2019d prefer handmade over store bought any day! Person MADE THING with their OWN HANDS?? Special one of a kind item made with love? 10/10.\n\nActually I was in a similar situation last Christmas so I made cookies for everyone. I was so afraid people would be disappointed but instead everyone was STOKED. Everyone stuffed their faces ASAP \ud83d\ude02", "Same. If it's been on my list for 3+ months, I really don't want/need it. The only exceptions to that rule are expensive items that I want to save up for, like camera lenses.", "I'm a potter, most friends and relatives get an annual pottery gift. I typically take orders (within reason) in August so everyone gets what they want."]}
