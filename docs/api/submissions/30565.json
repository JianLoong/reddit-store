I am in school working on a certification to improve my options, but all of the money I get is going to bills, rent, and groceries. This is something that is pretty well known in my friend group.\n\nBecause of my financial situation, I\u2019ve been pretty transparent with my friends that I\u2019ll be crocheting them gifts for the holidays (I have tons of yarn already on hand) and I don\u2019t expect anything of anyone because times are tough for most of us right now. \n\nMost of my friends are completely cool with this, partly because crocheting has been my side hustle for years and they know how much time and effort I put into these projects. But one friend (we\u2019ll call her Ann) gave some pushback regarding me making her and her child (1m) anything.\n\nI\u2019d asked Ann if her kiddo needed any warm clothes, blankets, or plush toys and she said to look at the registry she has open still from his birthday. I explained that as much as I\u2019d love to buy off the registry for Christmas, fiscally it isn\u2019t something I can do, and I was planning to make gifts this year. She argued if I\u2019m not buying gifts for anyone else I should \u201ceasily be able to buy gifts\u201d for her son AND her. I tried to reiterate that I cannot afford to buy gifts, but she waved me off saying I was \u201cbeing difficult.\u201d\n\nThis really frustrated me, not because she didn\u2019t want me to make either of them gifts (I\u2019ve had some parents share concerns they have regarding a child having an allergy to something in the material, dyes, or just personal preference, all of which I completely understand and respect), but because she seems to feel entitled to being the only person in my life to receive a store bought gift.\n\nI\u2019m opting to not get her or her son anything now out of principle. I know it sounds petty, but if I were to get enough money for a gift for anyone, it would be for my SO or dad, both of whom have helped me get through this rough patch.\n\nI talked to a mutual friend about it and she thinks I\u2019d be an AH if I gave everyone else gifts but not Ann and her son, and that I should maybe try to just get something under $10 for each. I really don\u2019t think I should be obligated to spend money on someone who is being this entitled and rude. AITA?\n\nETA: Ann is married to one of my relatives (not a SIL, but 2nd cousin in law type thing), and is also friends with many of the people in my friend group. My use of \u201cfriend\u201d was kind of the short version, I typically limit my contact with her as it is.

I can\u2019t imagine. I have four kids and a huge family. My friends and I do not exchange and if we do it\u2019s something food/drink related. \n\nYour friends completely out of line. You don\u2019t need to make or buy her anything and you shouldn\u2019t. Don\u2019t waste your time and materials on someone who\u2019s this entitled.\n\nNTA", "NTA, her entitlement is an affront, if she wants to burn a bridge over this, bring some hotdogs to cook on the fire.", "NTA \n\nShe isn't your friend if she is insisting on you buying her gifts. Gifts are voluntary, not mandatory. I also crochet, so I understand that some people don't like handmade items. She is fine to opt out of something handmade...it would be wasted on her anyway. Don't buy them anything. You've already stated it's handmade from your existing yarn supply or nothing. This isn't a negotiation.\n\nI've never heard of anyone creating a gift registry for birthday and Christmas gifts. It's tacky. She sounds materialistic and greedy.", "NTA. Christmas isn't about showing people what you can buy. It's about showing them you care. The idea that you would make gifts is a beautiful one and your friend is shallow and greedy.\n\nThere was a parenting advert in our country for Christmas a few years back...\"The best gift you can give a child is your time\"\n\nThis is the same for friends. The amount of time and effort going into a crochet should be the gift. Not the latest Sesame Street bath toy", "NTA.  If this so-called friend demands certain gifts and you can't provide them, then she doesn't get anything. Your mutual friend can buy Ann the gifts off her registry for you if this is so important for her.  Boy, it angers me when people think they can spend your money for you!", "NTA. Yeah, if you're willing to hand make something for someone and they tell you to buy off the registry instead, they are the a-hole.", "NTA and stand firm in your decision. You are putting much more than $10 worth of your time and skills into these gifts. Don\u2019t cave and pay for a gift instead. Your friend is obnoxious and so lacking in empathy it\u2019s astounding. Take care of yourself and your true friends will  be thrilled with their gifts made with love \ud83d\udc95", "NTA\n\nHaving food in your table is more important than buying Ann or her kid a gift. If she can't accept a lovely crocheted item, then she can do without anything from you.", "Waste of money buying them gifts.", "NTA but your friend is. Grubbing for gifts\u2014how tacky of her! I have received a number of gifts that are not what I wanted or might have bought. You smile, say thank you very much, and find something nice to say about them. Because it\u2019s better than no one wanting to give you presents.", "NTA. Ann is not a real friend. When it comes to your livelihood, a real friend would prioritize that for you that a dumb gift at Christmas. Your friend is valuing a good over the friendship with YOU.", "NTA she is not a friend. Make nothing for her. You don't demand or push.", "NTA a gift is a gift. It can be graciously accepted or not. You\u2019ve told her your situation and she showed you she feels entitled.\nDo what you had planned and a true friend will understand.", "NTA. This is not a friendship worth keeping. Take her off your friend list and put her on the naughty list.", "NTA. Why should you give them presents you can't afford? She is just a friend and her son. Sorry, but you ask her, if she wants what you can give. She declined. so no gifts for them.", "NTA telling someone in November you aren't in a position to buy presents is fine even if you have a long history of buying presents for each other.\n\nNobody has a right to gifts, but if there's an expectation you've done the right thing.\n\nAs for not getting them anything you are well within your rights to do that, but it'll probably cause drama, I'd be inclined to pick something on the list that you can make a version of, then let her be the bad guy when she tries to complain about you making a better version of what she asked for.\n\nBut honestly she sounds awful,  nobody who calls themselves a friend should be demanding you spend money you don't have", "NTA.\n\nAnn is not your friend. she cares very little about you", "NTA people like her are the reason I only get gifts for my parents and little brother.", "NTA Ann is acting rude and entitled and should get a lump of coal ( but you should not buy it. )", "Not at all. Look after yourself first. True friends will understand your current plight", "\"Happy Holidays, Ann. I hope I'll be in a better financial place soon; maybe we can get back to exchanging gifts next year.\"\n\n\nSend nothing but your very sincere regrets. And maybe you will have shed yourself of this entitled and rude \"friend\" before next holiday season.", "NTA, and your other friend is mistaken. A person who insists you can afford to get her and her son a gift is not the kind of person who will settle for something under $10 each. Her thinking is \"We have six friends, you would normally spend $20 on each of them which is $120. You're not buying anything for those six, so you now have $120 to spend on me and my son\".\n\nI don't think Ann is really your friend. I suspect that if you look back you'll see that there are plenty of other times where she has insisted you make sacrifices for her, but you know she would never do the same for you.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't give her anything. If she complains then your answer is simple; \"I asked you what you would like crocheted and you said 'nothing'.\" And if she never speaks to you again (after kicking up the requisite fuss) then consider that a price worth paying to not have to deal with her in the future.", "NTA, no one is entitled to your money, time or effort. I think it's really sweet that you're willing to put in the time to make something handmade and special for everyone. If she doesn't want to be included, don't include her. I'd really be reevaluating whether or not I wanted to continue the friendship if it were me, her reaction says everything loud and clear.", "Nta easily\u2026 it\u2019s so much more thoughtful to crochet a gift than to mindlessly shop off of a registry anyway. She\u2019s awful.", "This. Give her a card, with a candy cane for the kid or something. She's not your friend, she's an acquaintance and not one you need to spend any time or energy on.\n\nNTA and good luck with the job hunt!", "Came here to find the first comment that mentioned the registry. What in the actual hell? Like who does that for a 1st birthday??? \n\nBaby shower I can understand cause it\u2019s getting the parents stuff to be ready for a baby and you don\u2019t want 10 people to all get you the same onesie or try to get you a stroller when you already have one. But a 1yo\u2019s bday party? So materialistic and pathetic"]}
