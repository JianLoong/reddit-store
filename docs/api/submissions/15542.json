I\u2019ve had family members who are migraine sufferers and cancer survivors who have said the cancer was easier to deal with, because at least with the cancer you knew it was treatable or you were going to die at the end. \n\nIn some cases, migraines can escalate and cause a fucking STROKE.

They\u2019re sick of going out of their way for you by\u2026not using something that will cause you pain and suffering?

YTA. Migraines triggered by smell are absolutely a real thing. One of my firends is triggered so badly by the smell of mint that it can put her out of action for a whole week, she's even been hospitalised for the pain before. You are putting your sunscreen preference above your \"friend's\" health and that is just cruel.

I don't ask people to be quiet in public places because loud sounds give me a headache. If it bothers me, I just separate myself from the situation. \n\nNTA. Your friend could've simply just not been around you.", "Meh. No doubt it\u2019s rude to do the coconut thing intentionally, but no more rude than the people who turn on lights, clatter around, try to talk to me, or cook food anywhere in the house. As someone who has literally had a migraine over 300 days this year, I\u2019m a little surprised that the migraine friend would try to do a beach holiday given the bright sunlight, fishy smells, and people being loud outside on the beach. There are a lot of strangers covered in coconut sunscreen on the beach. Migraines suck but it\u2019s not really fair to demand that everyone around you changes all aspects of their lives to accommodate you unless you stay in a pressurized, soundproofed, dark room by yourself.", "NTA.

I remember in school I would get taken to a dark room and my mom would come pick me up. Then I would cry and barf a bunch and my mom would put cold rags on my head. I remember thinking how miraculous it was people knew what to do even though I didn't see anyone else get migraines and thought I was the only one. I got them a lot.

It\u2019s MY holiday so fuck everyone else. I can\u2019t enjoy myself unless I have this specific ran. \n\nYour \u2018friend\u2019: you are inducing a medical problem that screws up my vacation as I will actually have to miss a lot if it, and will at times in pain. I\u2019m asking you to compromise so we can both enjoy ourselves. \n\nThis is one of those occasions that usually when you say it out loud you realise you are being an AH.

Like, the open bottle alone gave me a migraine. Before it was even poured. I couldn't be in the same room.\n\nYTA OP just for saying she \"claims\" to suffer from it.
