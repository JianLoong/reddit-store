(Amy has admitted that she didn\u2019t actually intend to do anything, she just wanted to get her ex-boyfriend\u2019s attention.)\n\nThis also triggered a home eval by CPS. My wife\u2019s whole family begged her to come because they knew that Cam didn\u2019t stand a chance of passing the home eval without her help.\n\nCam\u2019s untreated mental health issues make it difficult for her to do more than basic cleaning. She also doesn\u2019t enforce any cleanliness rules on her two children. As a result, the house is littered with everything, including half-eaten food, which attracted rodents. There was so much stuff that her 7yo daughter couldn\u2019t get into her room and slept on the couch or the floor every night.\n\nThere has also been a hole in their bathroom floor for years, big enough for animals to come through, including the innumerable cats that are ostensibly theirs. The cats are not litter trained and have free reign of the house, where they pee and poop wherever they want and it\u2019s never cleaned up.\n\nCam originally offered to pay her brother to help clean, but he didn\u2019t even enter the house before he noped out. Her mother likewise refuses to set foot in the house. So my wife spent 60+ hours over the course of 4 days decluttering, organizing, cleaning, scrubbing, sanitizing, and doing some handyman/light construction work.\n\nHer father and Cam\u2019s husband did most of the handyman/construction work, and Cam and her husband helped with some of the decluttering, but my wife was the only one on her hands and knees doing backbreaking work that whole time. She\u2019s still got bruises and a shoulder injury from it, and she came home with a sinus infection.\n\nThere was no opportunity to discuss payment ahead of time. Cam hasn\u2019t said \u201cthank you\u201d once and has not offered any payment for the work.\n\nCam says that since we\u2019re family, we shouldn\u2019t expect anything. But in our minds, the point of helping family members for free is the expectation that they will also help you for free and it\u2019ll all even out in the end. They don\u2019t ever do anything for us.\n\nThey have the money to spare. Cam has told my wife how much money they have in the bank before (low 6 figures).\n\nWe didn\u2019t even suggest an amount. My wife asked Cam how much she thought the work was worth. When Cam said she had no idea, we shared some researched numbers for frame of reference.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t complain if Cam paid less than minimum wage, but we think my wife deserves something, especially since they had originally offered their brother money to help. Cam acted offended that my wife would even ask. My wife\u2019s father likewise said we shouldn\u2019t have asked for money and should instead just not help them again in the future. Are we TA for asking for my wife to be paid?", "created_utc": 1700579160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180j2as/aita_for_asking_with_my_wife_for_compensation/", "score": 372, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have endangered those children for even longer with this act of cleaning. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.", "Your wife should never have done the work at all.

But I grew up in a very unsanitary house with a major roach problem and I vowed never again. \n\nThat environment is not safe.

You cannot go back on that now. If she wasn't willing to do it for free, she should have said she wasn't willing to do it or negotiated with Cam ahead of time.\n\nAlso, you are very quick to brush off your niece's wellbeing. Your 15yo is behaved in a way that required a psych eval to \"get attention.\"  Also CPS generally doesn't remove kids simply for having mental health issues, CPS only becomes involved when there's evidence that the child's mental health will be better served by being away from the parents. Honestly, I'm guessing whoever tipped off CPS did so knowing that your SIL was not capable of resolving these issues or her parenting was contributing to the behavior in the first place.

If you work to help a family member without discussing payment, consider it volunteering.

In this case, you aren't the bad guy, but in a lot of cases you would be and it's very easy to spin it that way.\n\nIn this situation, the benefit to pushing for money is especially little. When you say \"we wouldn't complain if Cam paid less than minimum wage\", it's clear the issue is not the amount of payment or need for money, but the fact you feel your wife was taken advantage of and not respected or adequately thanked for her work, and those feelings won't actually go away if you have to hound your SIL for a couple hundred bucks.

Most of the new posts at this point are Rule 1 violations, and I've already gotten a Reddit Cares message.\n\nTo those of you who responded to the question I asked, I appreciate your feedback. This whole ordeal has been stressful and draining, and our heads haven't been in the right spot. We have learned our lesson not to help them anymore without setting clear expectations ahead of time, if we even do that.\n\nTo everyone else, I have read all posts that have been made up to this point. I appreciate your concern for the childrens' well-being. We are also worried about them. This sub-reddit's 3,000 character limit doesn't allow me to provide a more thorough picture of the situation... my initial draft was over 11,000 characters... but we have made repeated attempts to help the children, to advocate for us to take one or both of them, for everyone in that family to get therapy, for the family to hire a cleaner... everything you all have suggested, we've done, short of dialing CPS directly (though that's still on the table).\n\nThe police have been to the house several times and seen the situation. They did nothing. CPS has been notified about them several times. I'm not sure if they have ever actually been to the house... they no-call no-showed for the home evaluation appointment that sparked the clean-up, and have not arranged a new appointment yet. I do not have faith that CPS out in the boonies where they all live is going to be the savior you all think they will be. We are just happy that the current threat of CPS visiting allowed my wife the opportunity to clean up the house and provide a better living situation for the kids for however long it lasts, and she does intend to use whatever little bit of leverage she has on Cam to get her to maintain the current state of the house.\n\nWe are not equipped to care for the 15yo (Amy) even if we were allowed to take her. She is back in the home and is currently attending therapy once or twice a week, which is a small win. I don't know if it's court-ordered or not, nor do I know how long she will continue to go. I at least think that Cam does not go into the sessions with Amy, so Amy has privacy to talk to the therapist. My wife spent years talking to Amy, trying to help her and be an unofficial therapist and a safe person for her. Amy still seems to think of my wife as a safe person, but we don't trust that that's not an act to manipulate us, so we approach interactions with her with caution.\n\nWe are still absolutely willing to take the 7yo (who I haven't named in the post, but will call her Clara here) and had hoped to keep her longer than the 3 weeks her parents let us keep her after the current situation. Our lives and home are not currently ideal for us to take in a child permanently, nor do we have the funds for my wife to quit work and take care of her, but we are absolutely willing to make that sacrifice if it means helping Clara.\n\nThank you to everyone who didn't violate Rule 1 for your feedback. Have a great rest of your day. \\[Edit: fixed paragraph breaks\\]", "Not at all TA. This sister sounds disgusting and should have her kids taken away!

(Amy has admitted that she didn\u2019t actually intend to do anything, she just wanted to get her ex-boyfriend\u2019s attention.)\n\nThis also triggered a home eval by CPS. My wife\u2019s whole family begged her to come because they knew that Cam didn\u2019t stand a chance of passing the home eval without her help.\n\nCam\u2019s untreated mental health issues make it difficult for her to do more than basic cleaning.

A house so disgusting that multiple people noped out of even going in to clean? Animal waste everywhere? Children don't belong in that environment.", "That's on your wife.   As you state, your wife decided and went.", "It would have taken her less than a minute to send a text with the question.", "Imagine taking a 12 hour road trip and it never crosses your pathetic mind even once that the real issue is those children needing HELP. Not a coverup job. You and your wife and every adult in your family are fucking despicable.", "You can help someone get an out of control situation under control AND still step up and say the kids can't stay there any longer. \n\nOr now that the house is in better shape the family can monitor the situation and see if it starts to get bad again and then step in. \n\nThey can do both.", "As I said in the last paragraph of the post you replied to, CPS has been notified multiple times and has never done anything. We are trying to do the best we can for the kids.", "[deleted]", "The covering it up so CPS doesn't know the truth is despicable.

Like... Yes. For all of it, starting with the coverup.", "I was shocked when I got to the part of the story that confirmed Cam's husband exists. Why was he not getting any mention in the blame part of the story??", "Every adult that is aware of the situation and does nothing is to blame.", "They have money. If the parents can\u2019t clean, they can hire someone. If they can\u2019t do handy work, they can hire someone. But good job saving six figures while your child can\u2019t make a path through the filth to sleep in her own bed.", "If she has mental health issues, and the husband isn't really doing anything, then he's as much, if not more to blame. There's no mention of why he doesn't get off his arse and clean for his children,  could her issues be caused by being overwhelmed because she has a husband that does fuck all. Many posts are pointing the finger at the mother/wife.", "This. CPS should come in and take the kids anyway.", "There is no one else. Cam and my wife\u2019s parents live near Cam, but they can\u2019t take the kids in full time. They no longer allow the 15yo to even visit because she\u2019s tried too many shenanigans while under their roof. We\u2019ve encouraged them to take the 7yo more on weekends and holidays, but Cam doesn\u2019t really want to let them take the 7yo and not the 15yo. \n\nIt will take years to get back to the condition it was in. The hole in the floor is fixed so no more cats all over the house, and the 7yo\u2019s room is clean. She got a brand new bed to sleep in.

OP, his wife, and inlaws are not only enabling Cam's actions, but giving her husband a free pass. It's his house and filthy as well, why isn't he being held responsible for any of this?", "Her parents withdrew her from school because she was a bully to other students and a habitual liar. She convinced a few girls in her grade to accuse a school Santa of inappropriately touching them. She steals, is a flight risk, and is awful to her little sister in ways I can\u2019t describe because of the sub\u2019s rules. \n\nAs a 15 year old, she\u2019s old enough to know \u2014 and does know \u2014 that she doesn\u2019t want to live in filth, and yet she makes no effort to even keep her own space tidy. \n\nMy wife spent about 2 school years as her homeschool teacher/tutor and tried to be a good influence and a bit of a therapist, and it doesn\u2019t seem to have made much difference. \n\nWe worry that if we accept responsibility for her, she will continue to do things that will cause additional drama/trouble for us.", "The husband is a whole separate ball of problems that didn\u2019t fit in the 3,000 character limit or directly relate to the money question asked. He is not scot-free in our minds as far as the home situation goes.", "If the concern was helping them get out of the situation they would have not needed CPS to trigger them to offer to help.

They have no right to and they just helped cover up for CPS. They CANT do both and they ARENT doing both.", "If they knew the real condition of the house, saw how bad it was and you offered to take the 7yo, I'm sure something could have been worked out. There's a problem and you were offering a solution, usually people would jump at that. If it didn't work, just say you'd continue to seek assistance from other parties and that would include posting on social media asking for advice.

You can't say you're trying to do the best you can for the kids when you are saying that an abused and neglected 15 year old is part of the problem, and you don't want them anyway\n\nThat's so so gross.\n\nGuess what. At 7 years old I knew to keep my room tidy. But that's cause I was taught, helped and supported. If you're never taught or helped how would you EVER know. When your parents and rest of the family ignore your squalor and don't provide cleaning materials how would you keep clean. Is the 15 year old supposed to fix a hole in the floor to stop animals getting in themselves? Or should they be getting a job to buy cleaning supplies? You're being horrific to both kids by trying to cover up a bigger problem but especially judgemental to the 15 year old\n\nYTA. For all of it.", "except you literally contributed to HIDING everything from cps. you should\u2019ve called and made another report on the condition of the house. you are failing those children.", "They did nothing BECAUSE EVERYONE JUMPED IN TO HIDE THE PROBLEM. Jesus, man.", "The children having a father is not an \"at least\". He lives in the house he is part of the problem. An Equal part of the problem\n\nAnd the grandfather and aunt do not care enough to help, they care enough to cover it up. They are not helping. They are sabotaging help arriving. They are making it worse. Every single adult mentioned in this story is a bad person.", "I was going to post my own response but u/Curious-One4595 has nailed it. The fact that they are more concerned about money than the welfare of a child speaks volumes about them as people. I try not to jump to the removal of children from their families, but in this case, it seems absolutely warranted.", "Oh Snap,!! Another good point!!", "Amy is a teenager growing up in squalor who has threatened self-harm and your attitude is that they can kick her out in three years so she won\u2019t be part of making a mess? How can you possibly be so dispassionate towards your niece who deserves so much better? You can paper over the physical condition of the home but not the damage to these poor children.", "I've read all your comments so far and something stands out to me. Throughout your post and comments you talk about your SIL as if her untreated mental illness is the cause of all her problems and therefore isn't responsible for her situation or the neglect of her children. Yet you talk about the 15 year old child who is learning how to be a person like she wants to be this way, and not that she's been abandoned and neglected by everyone close to her starting with her mother.\n\n I'm just confused why SIL is absolved but her daughter who is literally being taught life by her is a write off?", ">My wife has told her sister that she will absolutely report them to CPS herself if Cam doesn\u2019t maintain it.\n\nTo little, years to late.  Disgusting\n\n>Amy will be 18 in a few years and stop contributing to the problems.\n\nPretty sure I'd be banned from reddit if I accurately described how bad you are", "CPS can help arrange therapy for the kids. It sounds like both are in need. \n\nAmy being 18 in a few years doesn't mean she will stop contributing to the problems. She'll start with the \"I'm an adult you can't tell me what to do\". And possibly put her younger sister in more unsafe situations.", "Amy may be a contributor to the problems but she isn't the root of the problems. It's Cam and her untreated mental illness. Get her treated and then you can start finding real solutions.

Promise.", "So you\u2019re all just going to abandon these children because it\u2019s too difficult. Your whole family is terrible\n\nAnd the fact that you keep blaming an abused 15 year old makes my stomach turn. You are a despicable human being", "So you abhor the way the children behave, which is a product of a lack of parenting, but no one wants to take them in. It sounds like CPS is the last chance these kids will have with learning how be a productive member of society, yet you and your wife decided to cover up the evidence that these children need help. INFO: why do you want to set these children up for failure?", "This CHILD has been abused and neglected her whole life. She shouldn\u2019t know better because she\u2019s being abused. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need your wife being a pretend therapist, she needs real medical help because she is clearly unable to function in mainstream society, due to the trauma inflicted on her by her whole family. \n\nAnd you should know, you\u2019re culpable to this trauma too, because you KNEW she lived in this disgusting situation and instead of getting her the real help she needs, you covered it up, and then blamed the victim for her just trying to gain attention. (A massive sign of neglect).", "You say she makes no effort to keep her room tidy\u2026 she was never taught! She literally does not know how to do that given the state of the rest of the house. What she is doing and how she is acting is because she wants to have some control over her life. Her parents are absolute crap and the extended family has failed her. \nWhere was the husband/dad in all this? He helped fix the house up, so why wasn\u2019t he busting his butt prior? I get that you live out of state from them, but the whole rest of the family knew about these conditions and did nothing. These kids have been repeatedly subjected to disease, filth, and rejection by their immediate and extended family. Even if they wanted to clean they obviously didn\u2019t have the tools or resources to do that. It\u2019s overwhelming to a 7 & 15 year old.

And the money is what you are asking about? Your niblings are people in need, help them!", "You helped cover up child neglect and abuse and all that you care about is a few dollars. What the hell are you thinking?", "Oh Snap!! Good point,!!!!", "Exactly. The 15 year old is behaving as she is as a direct result of her upbringing and mum's behaviour and she doesn't even have an aunt or uncle in her corner. It's very sad.", "I agree.

Screw OP", "& of course the 15 year old is going to say she was just trying to upset the ex. i'm sure she actually does need help but doesn't want to admit it.", "Can't you go to CPS yourself with pictures?
