For some context my bf loves to bake. I support him with it since he gets to do what he loves and I get to eat his yummy food. His favorite dish to make is a chocolate souffle which is great seeing as I love chocolate souffles. However, lately he's been calling me his perfect souffle and that I'm just perfect the way I am. We have just started trying for a baby and him calling me 'perfect' made me feel insecure as he had commitment issues in the past that he has been in therapy for 5 years for it. One day after going to the doctor and making sure everything is ok, I'm not feeling well and he comes in. He washes up then comes behind me and calls me perfect again. At this point I lost my temper and asked him if he didn't want us to be trying for a baby because my body will be different when I get pregnant? He went quiet and told me he was just trying to tell me that he appreciated me and my body before I got pregnant and insecure about my body. I felt really bad seeing as he was trying to do something sweet but went about it making me feel bad. I apologized and he accepted it but something still feels off. My sister told me I should upload her so Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the comments. I realize how unfair I was to my bf so I apologized to him again and we had a really long talk. Good news is that I found out I'm pregnant (yay!) so we are getting ready for that.

And he said it was because every time he complimented me I would call him a liar and complain about how I looked and started point out all my flaws. He felt attacked, so he stopped.\n\nBody issues are hard, but try to understand that just because he loves your body now doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t also love it in the future. If he says he likes the way you look, believe him!", "I feel like you jumping from him calling you perfect NOW to assuming he won't still think you are perfect later if your body changes was an overreaction. Calling a partner 'perfect' in general sounds like just a normal endearment to me, and nothing you say suggests it was loaded with an implicit threat of 'don't change or I will no longer think so'. \n\nI think you two just need a calm conversation about this kind of thing, if there are certain types of communication that cause you stress. \n\nSoft YTA.", "YTA and need to work on those insecurities with therapy too maybe. My BF will say things along those lines (and my body is far from perfect) but it and myself are perfect for him is how he means. He'll love me however I am. Doesn't sound like your bf was trying to be mean at all. If you'd just asked him to stop calling you that or asked why he calls you that it makes you insecure okay but yelling like that and taking that jump...yta", "YTA. Learn to accept his compliments instead of freaking out dramatically.", "YTA - he has a little nickname for you that he obviously thought was cute and meaningful since he likes to make souffl\u00e9s and you like to eat them. If you don\u2019t like the nickname then you should have respectfully told him so instead of yelling at him. Your story doesn\u2019t sound like you were justified in yelling at him over this. \n\nTtc can be stressful. Don\u2019t take that stress out on him.", "YTA\n\nIt honestly just sounds like a pet name, like \u201csweetheart\u201d or \u201choney.\u201d It\u2019s okay to not like a particular pet name, but assuming it\u2019s some kind of veiled attack and jumping down his throat about it uncalled for.\n\nIt really sounds like you have some serious insecurities that you should talk to a therapist about; your bf shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells over things like a compliment.", "YTA.\n\nIf I am reading this correctly, this is the first time you have objected to him complimenting you in this way.  Tt's not as if you told him calmly at any time that you didn't like it or what you didn't like about it.\n\nSo, you \"lost your temper\" about him repeating something which has apparently been annoying you, even though you never told him to stop.\n\nHaving a baby is a special subset of what everyone experiences, which is that our bodies inevitably change as we get older. If you don't want to have a baby, or you're not ready yet, have THAT discussion with your BF, rather than going on a rant because he called you perfect.", "YTA. He was being sweet and you shit on him for it. What is wrong with you?", "I get why that might have triggered your insecurities, but those insecurities are something you need to work on rather than losing your temper over. YTA.", "YTA -Your story doesn't read like a vailed attack at all to me. It sounds like he was sincerely complimenting you", "YTA. He's trying to be nice, all you have to do is ask him to stop. Yelling at somebody for trying to call you perfect is kind of a douchey move. I don't think that you're that bad of a person or anything, you're a small asshole. But an ass will know us", "What the bloody Hell?\n\nYTA\n\nBe an adult and use your words. The time to tell him you didn\u2019t like his pet name for you was five years ago. Screaming at him for breaking a rule that never existed is bullshit.", "I think you might have some fears because of his commitment issues he's dealing with.  Your reading more into his comments than there is. Sounds like you guys both need to work on that issue.  Maybe get some therapy or go with him and talk about it with the therapist.  Your possibly afraid he'll leave especially now with a baby coming into the mix possibly.  You have a cause for concern because of his problems with commitment and should talk about it before you have a child because that makes everything more complicated.", "NAH leaning to slight YTA.  This feels like your insecurities ran headlong into his insecurities.", "YTA", "Soft YTA-\n\nWhy not discuss with him why you didn't like being called \"perfect\"  made you upset rather than explode on him? Could also discuss a different nickname such as \"little souffl\u00e9\".", "Wow YTA. You definitely owe him an apology. You jumped down his throat over a compliment.", "YTA keep going to counseling", "YTA. You can just ask him not to call you that, or explain that you are imperfect because you are human and you don't want to be idealized. If it's more that by calling you perfect he makes you think of the ways you aren't perfect,  say that. \nJust talk to him about minor irritations like this before it gets unbearable, y'know?", "YTA, mildly because your insecurity is making you inconsiderate to your thoughtful boyfriend.  'Perfect Souffle' is a lot sweeter and more affectionate than a lot of pet names like 'ol'ball and chain', 'chick, 'babe', or others.  Your body may change with a baby, but your boyfriend is not the problem.", "YTA, gently. This sounds like a you problem, not a him problem, and you snapped at him about it instead of communicating. \n\nHe's just trying to be nice and sweet to you. You're making the nickname a negative thing in your own head, it does not sound like he means it that way. You need to talk to someone about why that irrationally upsets you, because it isn't rational.", "NB probably stands for No Brain .\n\nCalling you perfect is making you feel insecure.\n\nCalling you perfect somehow has something to do with his commitment issues.\n\nCalling you perfect means he doesn't want to have a baby.\n\nTo tell you the truth, he probably shouldn't have a baby with you.", "\n>We have just started trying for a baby and him calling me 'perfect' made me feel insecure as he had commitment issues in the past that he has been in therapy for 5 years for it.\n\nNAH because I think *this* is really your issue. It isn't the nickname. You have decided to have a baby with him, but you guys aren't married. He's had commitment issues in the past to the point he needed therapy and you have decided to dive into a lifelong commitment with him. I think you are concerned his commitment issues will resurface with such a big change and you are looking for *any* sign of him wavering. He was just trying to be sweet but you are worried he's going to split. You guys need to figure out how committed you are to your relationship before bringing a child into it. Whether you know it or not, you are very concerned he's not committed to you. It's why you yelled at him over something so minor and why your insecurity is surfacing after this decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He told you he loves your body before you get pregnant and insecure?  Why would he think you would feel insecure after getting pregnant if he is fully supportive of your changing body?  Nope, he doesn't get to throw that BS around.  He is telling you he loves your body now because he isn't going to love it once it changes.  This is the guy who is going to complain, after you give birth, that your body hasn't returned to the 'perfect' form he loves and is going to causing you massive insecurities until your body returns to pre-pregnancy (if it ever does).  And no one is 'perfect' -- that is putting a huge burden on you.", "YTA, you're projecting your insecurities. You need to deal with your fears and have a rational conversation, not just yell at him when he's trying to be cute.", "NAH. You overreacted and you were pretty unfair to your BF but it was clearly coming from a place of insecurity. I think you should probably unpack that because the response to someone complimenting you should never be to project your insecurity and yell at them but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, you just had a bad moment.", "ESH\n\nYou should read on how to communicate your feelings calmly and respectfully. Use \"non-violent communication\" as a search term.\n\nHe picked up on your insecurity and instead of discussing it with you, he altered his behavior. That is sweet I suppose but it's also kind of patronizing.", "NTA. You communicated a concern. Pretty basic.", "NAH \n\nSounds like you have some feelings about your body and are maybe stressed about some situations in your life. He is not responding how you want him to. It's fine to ask him to pick a different nickname.", "NAH  \n\n\nsounds like he was just using perfect souffle a cute coupley pet name like honey or dear", "Usually his compliments make me happy because it used to be blueberry but the stress of trying to concieve and worrying if something is wrong has had me a little stressed and exhausted", "I do want a child and we decided 1 month ago I think it was.", "He just recently started calling me the nickname not 5 years ago.", "It\u2019s not fine to verbally attack him though.", "I understand; I had difficulty conceiving and it is stressful and exhausting.
