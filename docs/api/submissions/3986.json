It's a pity she didn't cut you out along with the parents. Poor lady. Hope she can survie all three of you. \n\nYTA", "YTA- the funeral is about your BIL, who didn't have a good relationship with your parents. Now is not the time to be bringing up past grievinces- just be there for your sister, your parents don't need to come into this.\n\nAlso my condolences.", "YTA\n\nShe needs people around her who support her. Obviously your parents don't.  You're making a huge mistake to insist that your attendance be predicated on your parents being invited. Your job is to support your sister.", "YTA!", "YTA\n\nI think there was definitely a lot more doing on from Kat's side to go LC. I think you're not acknowledging that you and her have different relationships with your parents. \n\nAnyway, you absolutely did pick a side. And I understand why Kat is angry with you.", "YTA", "So Kat doesn't want the parents there that weren't supportive in her marriage that has now ended in the death of the person they didn't like, and you want to rip away the only family member that she *did* trust to be there for her?\n\nWell done,  YTA.", "YTA now is not the time for this. You are creating stress during an already traumatic time for your sister. Maybe your sister and parents will reconnect in the future, maybe they won\u2019t. But right now you need to listen to your sister and focus on what she needs. If she doesnt want the parents there, or has any other request, just respect her decisions and let her grieve.", "YTA \n\nYour parents did not get along with your BIL. And your sister went low contact. \n\nWhy would you expect them to be invited? They\u2019re worried now? Where were they before? \n\nYou\u2019re not caught in the middle. Your sister has made a decision that is right for her while she is grieving. She is not breaking your family apart. That already happened. \n\nYou\u2019re choosing sides.", "It\u2019s not a club event.  You go to a funeral because either thou had a relationship with the deceased or you have a relationship with someone who is grieving  .\n\nThat\u2019s it.  Those are the only deciding factors.\n\nStop being so dramatic.  YTA", "YTA You never say why your sister didn't invite your parents but she must have reasons. You're abandoning her to grieve on her own. Look after your relationship with her, not your parents relationship with her.", "YTA. You weren\u2019t caught in the middle, you placed yourself in the middle by giving her an ultimatum. \n\n> I'll be the first one to say my parents were pretty strict growing up, but it was never anything that serious, and they always looked out for our best interests.\n\nUsually the oldest bears the brunt of strict parents so I\u2019m not surprised that you don\u2019t believe it was serious. There\u2019s a reason why a lot of older siblings end up going no/low contact compared to younger siblings who seem oblivious.", "She has every right not invite your parents. It\u2019s none of your business! Your job as her sibling is to support her, not try to emotionally manipulate her. YTA!!", "Kat is burying her husband. Her husband. This isn't about you or your parents. Why would she want people at her husband's funeral who did not support their marriage of like her husband? Of course YTA. You screwed up. She doesn't want your parents there but she did want you there for support. Whatever relationship you had with Kat you are now responsible for damaging and possibly destroying do to your childish actions. The woman is grieving and stressed out and you expect her to play happy family with your parents at her husband's funeral. A man they didn't get along with or like that much. Ridiculous is what you are.", "YTA \n\nHer relationship with her parents has nothing to do with you. You\u2019re poking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong and trying to get on a high horse at her husbands funeral. That\u2019s low as hell. I hope she has people around her who are kinder than you are.", "YTA. You and your sister have your own relationship that has nothing to do with your parents. Be there for your sister and let them sort out their own relationship.", "YTA", "You aren\u2019t caught in the middle, stop lying to yourself. You\u2019ve chosen to place yourself there by issuing the ultimatum and not  listening to what Kat wants.", "NTA. It's like weddings some family member not invited then other family members don't attend. Invitations or not summons they can be declined no matter what the Invitation are for.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to force you to choose her over your parents. My general rule is that I choose whichever party is NOT trying to force me to pick them.  Your sister sounds like she\u2019s going through some things, so maybe give her some space and check back in with her in a few days. People make a big deal about, \u201cYou didn\u2019t show up to the wedding/baptism/funeral\u201d so maybe you send flowers to the funeral home (can be expensive) and a condolence card to her home. That way, you can \u201cbe there\u201d for her in a tangible way even if you\u2019re not physically there.", "NAH\n\nI know I'm going against the grain, but for some reason people think a funeral is also a summons. Just like you wouldn't be expected to come to anything else you've been invited to, a funeral is the same. OP doesn't have to justify to anyone if she doesn't go, and that doesn't make her an AH. Also the negative influence part, was it something petty or was he actually a negative influence? Since she was fairly young getting married, I'm wondering if he was significantly older and there was a power dynamic there.\n\nI don't think Kat is an AH either because she also has a right to want her sister at the funeral.", "Nta", "NTA. You can decide not to attend just as your sister has decided not to invite your parents.  Whether you go or don't is not going to change how she feels.  It's not your battle.", "I would guess that Mark's grieving parents also don't want to have his in-laws at this funeral after the contempt they showed him while he was alive.", "It feels like the parents only want to be there to regain control of sister now that her \"bad influence\" (read: likely saw through whatever manipulation tactics they use) husband is \"out of the picture\". It's so gross and sad and honestly makes me so sad for the sister as I am definitely the Mark to my husband's family. \nThey see me as a bad person because he's low contact with them now. He hated the way they treated me, even though I explicitly told him he didn't need to and I don't need their approval. But it was so much deeper than it seemed because he was seeing them treat me the way he'd been treated his entire life and was finally able to acknowledged the toxicity. Like the canary in the coal mine, he had no idea how bad it was. Until he did, and now he can't go back.", "How do you know they were abusive?", "So Kat switched college majors in her final year. Dad has an IT firm and Kat was studying computer science (and she was getting good grades), and she dropped out to anthropology because that's apparently what she 'originally wanted', and Mark was the one that encouraged her to do so. But that means she lost all those previous years of study and a promising career. He also spent a lot of money on a violin so she could pick it up again, etc. My parents thought he was manipulating her", "Yeah, I find it curious that there's no explanation of what a \"negative influence\" means when he was also only kind, respectful, and loving...? \n\nIt's mind-boggling that OP seemingly walked a line of keeping both her sister and her parents in her life for this long, but decided his *funeral* is the day she finally has to choose sides. And she didn't choose her grieving sister. Wow.", "100%", "Oh he deleted that comment! He left that out ok purpose from the post!", "Funerals are NOT like weddings. Choosing not to attend a funeral to punish the widow for perceived slights against parents is just cruel. YTA.", "According to OP's comment, they wanted Kat to pursue a career in IT because it would benefit their business. Her career choice was anthropology, and around the time she met Mark, she switched her college degree, so they blame him. She loved playing the violin and her parents thought Mark was \"manipulating\" her when he bought her a violin so she could go back to playing. So reading between the lines, they didn't want her playing the violin. \n\nI don't know if the word is abusive, but it's definitely deeply controlling.", "So he was a negative influence because he was supported of her dreams and choices and wanted her to be happy?\n\nYour parents are in the wrong here.", "So, he\u2026 supported her? That\u2019s his negative influence?\n\nAlso, I\u2019m literally sniggering at how buying a violin could be perceived as a negative thing. A violin!?! The horror!", "The people who pushed her to get a degree she didn't want for a job at daddy's firm think the guy who believed in her passions manipulated her?? \n\nBig yikes. You should grovel.", "The audacity of that man encouraging his girlfriend and future wife to follow her dreams and to pursue a hobby that she seemingly enjoyed. Can you believe it guys? Look at how much of a bad influence he was to Kat. He was such an asshole. /s", "It seems like your parents were controlling, and her husband helped her escape that.", "Wait your parents manipulated/pressured her into a degree but he\u2019s the one who manipulated her? Hmmm", "So, your parents didn't like the guy because he encouraged her to do what she wanted to do with her life? That's messed up. Your parent's expectations do not matter in the grand scheme of anyone's lives other than their own. They thought he was manipulative, when really, he encouraged her to be her true self and to be happy in life.", "Wtf. \n\nHe's a bad influence because he encouraged her to follow her dream instead of your father's, and encouraged her to pick up a form of artistic expression again, something she was obviously passionate about to warrant him spending \"a lot of money\" on? \n\nHe sounds like an awesome human being who saw your sister as the person she truly was, instead of the person she was expected to be. \n\nBig yikes.", "Alright, so Kat was facing pressure to do what your parents wanted, and they were resentful of Mark because he empowered and supported her to be her own person with her own goals and interests. That's not 'bad influence' behavior. It sounds more like your parents were mad about losing out on their investment.", "His negative influence was telling her to follow her dream where your parents wanted control of her every waking moment even into adulthood.", "So your parents pushed her into a study path that suited them but didn't suit her, and then they blamed her partner when she finally chose to go with what she really wanted. Now that he's gone, they think they can manipulate her into working for the family business on the cheap. \n\nIt sounds like your parents are very toxic and controlling ,and out to use her for what they can get out of her, so she's much better off away from them. Maybe you'll have more empathy for her when you want something that doesn't match up with what they want.", "Kinda sounds like your parents manipulated her into going into computer sciences when that wasn\u2019t her dream", "That\u2019s not being a negative influence on her. I assumed you had meant he got her to, say, drop out of college and do drugs and rob people. Switching to a major she likes and taking up playing the violin aren\u2019t negative things.", "Sounds like your parents are manipulative not him who did nothing but support her.  \n\nYou sure they are not manipulating you lol sounds like it to me. They talked about their feelings not your sister.   They are ass major and I wish I was in the room to tell them to their face. \n\nYou do not deserve your sister.", "So he encouraged her to follow her dreams, and somehow he's the bad guy? I think it's really that your father expected her to work in his business, and with her changing her major, he knew that wasn't going to happen. YTA", "Being supportive is manipulation and a negative influence in the eyes of your parents? \n\nYTA for being supportive of your parents in this at all.", "Please add this as a note to your post. I expect this won't change people's verdict, but this is definitely relevant info.\n\nAnd please take a close look at what people say on this and reflect on it. You state that Mark had a bad influence on her, but the opposite is the case. Your parents were over controlling and tried to push your sister (and maybe you as well) into a career she didn't want. Your parents are the ones manipulating here, not Mark. He taught your sister to stand up for herself.\n\nIf your parents were this controlling with your sister, they probably were with you as well, even though you may not realize that yet. Again, please reflect on the comments in this post and learn from it. Not just for you, but also for your (future) children. You don't want to make the same mistakes your parents made.", "... okay? What else?", "Omg, YTA and so are your parents. \n\nObviously, you decided to put your parents wants above your sister's wellbeing during HER husband's funeral. The husband your parents obviously didn't like. Why would you do that?\n\nAnd also, the bad influence is that Mark supported your sister in doing what she wants to do and uour dad lost out on an investment? I'd stop talking to my parents too.", "So your dad lost a future employee over something as silly as his daughter's dreams/s. Just wow at all of you so called \"family\" members.", "The actual audacity of this man! He\u2019s such a negative influence! He encouraged her to follow her own path, why would he do that when she could be unhappy following the path your dad wanted!!", "You and your parents are major AHs. Mark encouraged your sister to follow her dreams instead of being forced into a career that would only benefit daddy dearest.", "Encouraging her in her actual interests is negative? It sounds like your parents are controlling, and hated that he broke the pattern.", "YTA - especially after this comment. No wonder your sister doesn't want your parents there. Mark was a great influence on her and your parents didn't like that he steered her towards chasing HER dreams rather than your parent's dreams.", "YTA and frankly so are your parents unfortunately it sounds like Kat lost the one person who truly cared about her happiness and her dreams. Your parents were bitter that she stopped letting them control her and you have decided to side with them. God my heart breaks for Kat to lose the man she loves and realize she never truly had the unconditional love of her family.  I pray she finds peace and healing.", "OP said in a comment that the parents wanted Kat to study IT at college because Daddy has an IT company, but her new boyfriend gave her the confidence to switch to anthropology. Also Mark bought her a violin so she could start playing AGAIN. \n\nBasically, he encouraged her dreams and passions instead of helping his in-laws treat her like a commodity.", "Probably that he accepted/encouraged her decision to want to go NC with her parents after a childhood that wasn't great. And they took great offense", "Wow, they sound horribly selfish too. Wanted her to do IT to support \"their\" business. \nWhat awful people. \n\nOP is TA", ">so she could pick it up again. \n\n>Again\n\nDon\u2019t waste your time with silly hobbies. Go into IT like Daddy.", "Oh yes, definitely a red flag when he coerces her into playing that devil music.", "If you're a bad player, I guess...", "I can\u2019t even imagine OP typing this excuse with a straight face. Anyone with common sense can tell who the manipulators are.", "So true. I have a neighbour who is learning the violin (I assume/hope they\u2019re still learning), and\u2026 uh\u2026 I guess I wish they would just practice somewhere else."]}
