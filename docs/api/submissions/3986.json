You are picking sides and it\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019re picking the wrong one.\n\nI had my judgment locked in at you being the ass in the first place, but after seeing your comment about how he was a \u201cnegative influence\u201d I am just appalled.\n\nAll Mark did was support your sister. He encouraged her to do the things she loves and wanted to spend her life doing, and your parents got pissy and called him a manipulator because she didn\u2019t go into IT like daddy did.\n\nYour parents weren\u2019t \u201cstrict, but looking out for our best interests\u201d, they were controlling assholes that disregarded anything you wanted to do that didn\u2019t meet their criteria of being worth time.\n\nYou are wrong. Your parents are wrong. You didn\u2019t get thrown in the middle, you picked a spot on their side, and stood there while your sister is grieving the only person that ever actually encouraged her to do what she loves.\n\nYou are going to lose your sister to this. You need to step back and look at your parents behavior for what it is before you become an only child, because if I were in her shoes; I wouldn\u2019t put up with my brother turned daddy junior putting his foot down on the wrong side when I need him the most. I\u2019d cut you out of my life so fast you might as well have been born an only child.\n\nYour parents are old and stuck in an outdated and shitty way.

Dad has an IT firm and Kat was studying computer science (and she was getting good grades), and she dropped out to anthropology because that's apparently what she 'originally wanted', and Mark was the one that encouraged her to do so. But that means she lost all those previous years of study and a promising career.

A real monster, her dad not Mark of course.", "Wow. So Mark was supporting her and her dreams, not what her parents had hoped of, and her parents are the controlling ones but call Mark the \"bad influence\". I sure would not invite them either.", "Whew! I already didn't like the passing of \"using the opportunity\" to go LC/NC and sure enough, the \"opportunity\" turns out to be parents mad they don't get to write the terms of their adult daughter's life anymore. Poor woman! To lose her husband and then find out her own sister won't even respect her grief and has to be a flying monkey for the parents at this is all times!\n\nYTA, OP.", "Thanks for adding.

I thought at least it would be something like \"smoking weed\" or \"listening to black metal.\"\n\nHe supported her changing her college major. Oh, the horror!\n\nYou realize most normal people would be shocked at your parents' holding a grudge over this shit, right?", "It sounds more like he was supporting her, and that your parents were manipulating her.

He was the first person to care about what *she* wanted. \n\nI had a roommate in college who was there for a teaching degree. She wanted to go into psychology, but her parents wanted her to be a teacher.

Mark sounds like a fucking fantastic guy who supported his girl. Your parents sounds like the fucked up couple here. Your parents were manipulating her not Mark.

Can I get your invitation? Cause yeah this dude was awesome and a proper celebration of his life is most certainly warranted.", "Wow that's it. How anticlimactic. No drugs, alcohol, cults involved, but she committed the most sinister act imaginable. She (gasp) changed her major. Something hundreds of thousands hell millions of students do. Did it ever occur to you that your sister doesn't want to live under your parents' thumb thus she changed her major so she wouldn't work for your dad. Maybe thats why her husband convinced her to do so. I wonder if your parents are funding your education or paying for other living costs and that's why you're so eager to please them or take their \"hurt feelings\" to heart instead of your sister's who just lost her husband. Hey man if your parents are hooking you up can't blame you but at the end of the day YTA.", "So your parents lost control of her...

Mark's family will have so much anger at your parents for how they disrespected and ignored him. They are grieving, so their emotions will run high.

And may I never recover!", "Maybe OP is as controlled as Kat was. I'm wondering whether OP is following her dreams and wishes or her parents now. \n\nPoor Kat, she lost the person who loved her and encouraged her to follow her dreams. \n\nOP, you have made such a mistake trying to take a stand at this time, against a man who was nice to you.
