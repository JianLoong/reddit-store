Her dying request to my partner (29M) was to reconcile with his sister (33F) & repair their relationship because SIL & I do NOT get along.\n\nI never said my partner had to choose between me & his sister, nor that he couldn't spend time with his sister's kids (16m,13f,11m), nor that he couldn't take our son (1m) to spend time with them all. \n\nI have a very poor opinion of SIL as a wife, sister, daughter mother & human in general, & I am not the kind to keep it to myself. She has refused to have a relationship with her nephew because of us not liking one another. She doesn't like me because \"I stole her brother from her\" & her family likes me (the family has told me this themselves & also that they share the same poor opinions of her).\n\nI told my partner I don't know how to apologize for my poor opinions of her, but that I CAN apologize for not keeping it to myself. I also told him that if he wants an apology from me, he needs to tell his sister that she needs to apologize for not wanting to have a relationship with her nephew, our son, because she doesn't like me & can't be an adult regarding her nephew.\n\nI again told him he could do family things with them & our child without me. He insisted that we were a \"package deal\". \n\nMy family thinks I shouldn't apologize. His family says it's not their monkey nor their circus, but that I should consider it if it will make my partner happy. My partner even told me to LIE if I have to, which I would.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: SIL stole a shit ton of money from her brother & mother. Almost killed her brother with alcohol poisoning when he was 14. Got brother into the drug game at 12. Goes partying every night but can't get her kids to school & they almost ended up being held back because of how much school they missed. Routinely cheats on her husband. Takes her children to places that drugs run rampant. Dumpster dives with her children in the middle of the night in winter storms. Just to list a few\n\nEdit 2: SIL & her husband are getting a divorce & she was just caught by the guardian at litem coaching her youngest on what to say to them regarding why they didn't go to school when she called saying they missed the bus, but would be there.", "created_utc": 1679857808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122w65a/aita_for_not_wanting_to_follow_through_on_my_mils/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This can be an exhausting role for him. \n\nMIL's wish speaks to: Life is full of conflict and differing opinions. The goal is to navigate them more successfully as they occur. MIL also may be conveying:  Life is short and it would be great if this dynamic could be better.

You do not owe anyone your time, let alone a family relationship, and if SIL really has been as consistently unreasonable as you suggest then this situation is unlikely to change her.\n\nI do feel for your husband as being stuck between your blood family and your spouse can be extremely difficult, but if you have made your reasons clear to him for wanting to keep SIL out of your life, he should ultimately understand and support you.  Adding in the deeply emotional request from his mother is only going to make it more challenging for him, but I think your instincts are right in sticking to your guns here.", "NTA.

I'm not sure why you'd have to apologize to SIL when she seems to have been the one responsible for the bad relationship between the two of you. It was/is horribly immature of SIL to hate you for \"stealing her brother.\" What an odd concept! Anyway, the dying wish seems to concern your husband. He's the one who needs to reach out and say, \"It was mom's dying wish that we reconcile. Are you willing to take the steps?\" An apology shouldn't come into it. Also, why are you a package deal? I didn't like one of my husband's brothers. My husband would hang out with him occasionally, but I didn't. We were both fine with that. Can't decide on judgment without info re apology.", "NTA for not wanting to follow the dying request. Your husband can have a relationship with her. You are not stopping him. If he wants to stand by you, that is his decision. \n\nBut the main question is: seeing his sister, who has done terrible things to him and his nephews, will make him happy?\n\nI think it feels like he is using you as an excuse not to see her, but also because he doesn't want to interact with her alone after all this.", "NTA.\nYour SIL seems very troubled. Her addiction likely plays a huge role in her actions, and I feel bad that she's struggling with addiction.

The whole world, and your SIL do not benefit from hearing what you have to say.  Did you identify problem's she was unaware of?
