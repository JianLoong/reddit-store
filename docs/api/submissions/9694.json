Please don\u2019t think this is something you must do just because right now you can. Your brother needs to figure out how to provide for his son\u2019s needs for at least the next 18 years. \n\nYou deserve compensation for your work. You should be receiving far more than $50. a week. Can your brother truly not afford it or does he simply think he shouldn\u2019t have to pay for his needs? \n\nAlso, you mentioned a spinal condition. Babies grow fast. This might be a very temporary situation before you can\u2019t safely lift and care for your nephew and your brother needs to be prepared for that. He can\u2019t be allowed to bully you into something you can\u2019t physically provide or neglect his son. \n\nWho cares for your nephew when you are not doing it? Does your brother take care of him before and after work? \n\nI realize that you have a situation that affects your ability to work a traditional job. However, you are accomplishing a great deal by providing this special care. There may be more options out there than you realized.\n\nPerhaps the baby\u2019s mother should have custody if she has the ability to provide appropriate care? What support services are available to help her and help the baby? Are there programs with caregivers or funding or housing or whatever she would need to help your nephew thrive?\n\nIf your brother controls his anger he should get to have time with his son. However, if he was abusive to the point where his girlfriend\u2019s hair was falling out from stress, I fear for the baby\u2019s safety.\n\nGood luck and I hope to hear of an update about how things improved for all of you.", "NTA.

You should be asking for much more for the amount you are doing. Stand up for yourself, get proper compensation for your time and efforts.", "I think the real asshole is your mom for sticking her nose into this when she's not offering up her own time for childcare.\n\nWhat's it to her?
