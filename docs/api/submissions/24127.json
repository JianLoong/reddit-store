It doesn't matter if you \"didn't really have to worry\" about a roof over your head or not.  Not having your own place, having to haul water, wood, use a generator because there's no electricity, etc. and so on.

He doesn\u2019t have to be sleeping under a tree.", "NTA, given OP's context in his comments.\n\nThe kid had a house with his parents. His parents worked out that he would continue to live with friends for the sake of his college applications. He had access to the resources of *both* his parents and his friends' parents. A truly homeless 17-year-old would have none of that. He embellished it and called it \"homelessness\" for the sake of college applications. The very same applications he and his parents used to justify making arrangements for him to live with other families.\n\nSo, what, why is this bad? Well, it's bad because *Ivy League schools actually hate poor people*. I tried applying Ivy and was quickly sussed out as a poor kid. I didn't know how to write a good essay, my resume formatting was trash, I didn't own a suit to go to character interviews, and I didn't do charity work as a teenager, I had to work and have a job. When I was later, *actually homeless*, I mentioned it in law school during interviews for prestigious positions as a struggle I overcame. This *actual* homelessness immediately marked me as poor and disgusting, and none of the interviewers liked it or responded positively. I only started landing prestigious positions when I learned better and never mentioned my poor upbringing.\n\nRich people like rich people with fake sob stories. They do not like poor people. The kid in OP's story leveraged that fake sympathy rich people like to extend to kids that are not too poor, too uncouth, or too dirty to get into an Ivy League school. Meanwhile, actual high-achieving kids that are *actually homeless* would not get a modicum of the same regard. Kids facing broken homes or foster care, bouncing from one tenuous situation to another, also wouldn't get the benefit of being \"homeless.\" This was 100% manufactured homelessness for college applications.\n\nHe and his friends are manipulative rich people being raised by manipulative rich parents that understand that the goal of being like this is to keep actually disadvantaged kids out of the prestigious positions that they, by virtue of their higher birth, supposedly deserve. And they will make sure they get them, by hook or by crook.\n\nEdit: go find the OP's comments where he mentioned the kid had a car *his parents paid for* and an unlimited credit card *his parents paid for*. This is 100% a rich kid manufacturing bullshit for sympathy from other rich people and they'll all sneer from the deck of their future yacht at actual homeless people. This is truly disgusting levels of duplicity and you all should not feel sorry for that kid.", "You're younger, so I understand where you might get this idea (I know how that sounds, but hand to god, I'm not trying to be condescending), but YTA here. Couch surfing is legal homelessness, it IS traumatizing being thrown into it, it is not at ALL a stable position to be in, and I guarantee you he was not just \"chilling\" (having taught many kids in this boat, a chill veneer often doesn't mean much, and it doesn't take a lot for it to fall apart.) Homelessness is as homelessness does; if they weren't \"really\" homeless, then they sure wouldn't have to keep moving to avoid living in their car.\n\nThink about it this way. Do you consider repeated temporary squatting in abandoned buildings after losing your house \"not really\" homelessness?\n\nYou need to know you are seeing this from afar and do not know the behind-the-scenes turmoil going on here.

He had no place that he belonged to. No place where he could be comfortable and relaxed and himself. That's what being homeless is. It's not being house less it's being homeless. You don't realise how important a home is until you don't have one. You behaved like an entitled selfish ass.", "I think living with friends for months as agreed upon in advance as a sure thing, count as \"permanent housing\"", "And even if it wasn't why do you care if he embellished to get a step ahead?", "It's also called precariously housed and it can be a nightmare. Like sure, you're not on the streets but you don't need to be in the worst case scenario to feel the effects.", "YTA. Is your last name Mirriam or Webster? Because unless you write dictionaries for a living, you don\u2019t get to define homelessness.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t really matter if you read his story & \u201cdon\u2019t see that as homeless\u201d. What you \u201csee\u201d &/or \u201cdon\u2019t see\u201d as homeless is worth less than gum on someone\u2019s shoe.\n\nQuit talking out your ass & making a fool of yourself. Educate yourself.", "There was a helluva lot of security sleeping in other rich peoples houses. He had a home, a60k car and an unlimited credit card. How many homeless people have that, ehhh buster?", "Why did I have to scroll this fucking far. Thank you", "All the YTA responses must feel strongly about the \\*checks notes\\* homelessness epidemic in the foreign exchange student community, which was pretty much exactly what the kid in the OP was doing.", "yeah NTA in this specific instance.\n\na long time ago my dad kicked me out and my mom currently had 2 kids, a dog and a cat staying with her in a 1 bedroom flat. it was about a 6 month + period where i crashed at a friends and lived out of bags.\n\ni still struggle to call that homelessness. i was unemployed and completely broke. living off the kindness of a friend's family until i got back on my feet. \n\ni described it as homeless before and felt immediate guilt.\n\ni can't imagine spinning what this guy went through as homelessness.", "Poor baby sorry your writing skills are trash, has nothing to do with the OP, who got into an Ivy League while homeless. Couch surfing is homelessness, good on you for never having to experience it. Imagine gate keeping what homelessness is lmao", "Yep, I'm blown away by all the \"YTAs\"  His follow up answers elaborate even further that the boy chose to stay behind. AND had an unlimited credit card paid for by his parents and access to a vehicle paid for by parents. Absolutely not homeless in any way shape or form.", "He didn't represent himself falsely by this fellow's own words.  The op just doesn't believe that the definition of homeless is considered homeless.  He disbelieves valid dictionary definitions just to be spitefully angry.  YTA op.", "Except he wasn't homeless. He chose not to live at home.", "And you too. This guy was not homeless.", "He was homeless. You should educate yourself. Housing planned in advance. 60k car, credit card with high limit. Not homeless.", "Oh so you\u2019re gatekeeping homelessness now?", "Except it's by his own choice. His parents have a home. He refuse to live in it. Not homeless", "This should be higher up!!! Everyone read this before your judgement!\n\n@OP, be better at explaining things on reddit. Its unforgiving when you leave out such important details!\n\nNTA", "In the 1920s my grandma had a high school student as a lodger. His mom and stepdad were moving and he didn't want to.", "A motel and not all my money goes into renting an apartment. It costs way more to live in a motel. There\u2019s no where to cook in a motel. You cannot receive mail there. You really can\u2019t even begin to understand the differences? Come on now\u2026", "No, he was in those places at other people's mercy. That's literally homelessness. I know you changed the details afterwards but just for the record, friends letting you crash on their couch/spare room cause you have no place to go IS HOMELESSNESS.", "NTA he was living at friends houses his parents had set up before they left. He could have left with them and stayed at their new house but he didn't want to. He wasn't homeless.", "Kids who run away or are thrown out but will be allowed to return if they \u201dfix\u201d whatever their parents deem is wrong with them also have an \u201dactual home\u201d.\n\nYou are focusing on homeless as a strictly financial issue. Not even the financial situation of the person without a permenant home but the financial situation of the people volontering to help. That seems to make you feel like this kid is taking support from the \u201dreal\u201d homeless.\n\nHe might have had it better than someone sleeping on the street, but you are gatekeeping how homelessness looks like and how it is caused. Your limited view on what being homeless is something organisations that work with these issues are activly trying to change. If you have such strong opinions on this issue that you would start an argument about it, then you should read up on the current debate and the basic arguments involved. It might not make you sympethetic to this specific kid, but it might help you understand why others would support him. It could help you not be so angry about it.", "Go back and read it again. The kid is not homeless.", "He had a 60k car and an unlimited credit card. He very well could have made it across state lines", "You are actually wrong on this. A study was done recently that showed lower income students under about the 60th percentile for income had an INCREASED chance of college acceptance as did the top .1% of income. It's the upper middle class in the 60-99th percentile of income that are penalized in college admissions. This was based on similar academic qualifications. (Search up the article in NYT for more info and the chart)", ">some stats on how many homeless people have fully paid for cars and credit cards.\n\nUh, a fair bit. Many people lose their home bit keep their vehicles. Keeping mobile is arguably more important to trying to improve your life after such events that would have led to that. Also, unless they were always on the edge of poverty people have credit cards. Yes there's a subsection that don't, and a smaller subsection who don't even have a debit card because they can't pay the monthly fee regardless of how small but you're painting homelessness in a weird light too. Now whether there's anything  available on those cards or whether they are maxed out but some payments have been made so they don't have it revoked is another matter.\n\nNot arguing about this case in particular, but your broad statements don't hold up more generally.", "Except he wasnt", "It's also called precariously housed which is more commonly used in social services, government, surveys etc."]}
