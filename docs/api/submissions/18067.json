Any guy who has walked onto an underaged girl changing multiple times and still refuses to knock is at best an utter moron and at worst a certified creep. It is also insane that no locks are allowed even for the bathroom. A good mum would be firstly deeply concerned at how her boyfriend manages to walk in on her daughter changing multiple times, and also would allow you the basic right to privacy that is locking the bathroom door.  Unless you genuinely think these are innocent mistakes, although I have to say it would be very unlikely, I would be considering discussing this with a teacher at school. I'm really sorry this is happening to you.", "NTA and it's creepy that he \"accidentally\" opens it without knocking.", "NTA. Your last sentence in the edit is ... very disturbing.", "This is pretty concerning behavior... if you walk in on a teenager changing once, as an adult you learn to knock before entering pretty damn quickly. And most houses you should be able to hear a shower running from outside the door, so unless your bathroom is oddly soundproofed for some reason, no way that was an accident. And there is absolutely no reason for him to be trying to get into your bedroom while you are asleep. You need to find an adult you can trust to confide this behavior in... maybe it's all innocent and accidental, but it's better to overreact and be safe, than trust someone after this many \"accidents\". Please do not trust your mom's boyfriend!", "This is 100% not okay. Is there a family member you trust you can talk to?\n\nThat he is walking in on you changing and in the bathroom is concerning, and the fact that he has CONTINUED after you expressed discomfort is even worse.\n\nAn adult pushing your boundary like this is not OK and I hope you have a trusted adult to call on.\n\nNTA.", "Is there a school counselor that you can talk to. That doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy or safe environment \u2026", "NTA. You should\u2019ve your own privacy at your age. I think you should inform this to an adult that you can trust (counselor or teacher) it sounds concerning.", "NTA - I would make a bigger deal about this boyfriend walking into your bedroom unannounced. That\u2019s super creepy. You wouldn\u2019t need to lock your room if he respected your privacy and knocked before entering. Your mom needs to talk to him about this, and if it doesn\u2019t stop, you should be allowed to lock your room as a precaution. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t want you going to a counsellor or another adult talking about how her boyfriend won\u2019t stop walking into her teenage daughter\u2019s room unannounced, trying to catch her changing. The fact that it happened once, and he hasn\u2019t learned to knock, makes it even more concerning. He is not your parent and has no reason to be intruding on your privacy like that.", "This is not okay. Talk to school councilors, CIS workers, SOMEBODY!\n\nThis is red flag behavior!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYARG!!", "NTA-an adult male should never enter the bedroom of a teenage girl without announcing their intentions, and WTH is he doing going into your room while you are sleeping? That is some creepy behavior by both mom and boyfriend. \n\nSince it is likely that if you don't give her the key she will remove the door I suggest screaming at the top of your lungs when he enters unannounced claiming you were frightened not knowing who was coming into your room.", "NTA\n\nYour mom's boyfriend is disrespectful. I mean, it's common sense to knock *especially* when in the bathroom. \n\nI'm sorry that your mom and her boyfriend don't respect your privacy.", "NTA, did he give your mom a reason why he came into your room at night?", "NTA, if you're forced to give up the key. You should move something heavy to stop the door from being opened in your sleep. Or ask a different family member to buy you a hidden nanny camera.", "NTA and your mom is TA for letting her boyfriend violate your boundaries like that. Him accidentally walking in on you changing or in the shower should have happened once, at most.\n\nYou have a right to feel safe in your own home, and your mom is failing to provide that. You need to tell someone you can trust, a school counselor or a teacher, what's going on before something bad happens.", ">I\u2019m not paying rent so I have no right to lock any rooms.\n\nStupid argument. You are a child. She is obligated to provide you housing regardless of whether you pay rent or not.\n\nShe is, however, your guardian, which means the state gives her fairly significant leeway with regards to your property/freedom etc... Sucks, I know.\n\nPersonally I think NTA. You should be able to have privacy in your room while changing, and his lack of knocking is downright rude, if not creepy.\n\nThat being said, it seems like AH/NTA isn't really your biggest issue. Telling your mom \"strangers on the internet think I'm right\" isn't going to help.\n\nYou might try to have a conversation with your mom once she's cooled down. Maybe when things are less fresh her cooler head will prevail. Your goal isn't to argue \"I need this lock\" it should be to try to help your mom hear your need for privacy. Locking your door is just a strategy to meet that need.  If your mom is able to hear your need then hopefully she will either let you keep the lock, or work out a different solution that meets both of your needs.\n\nIf not you have the option to play hardball, but recognize that it will likely damage your relationship with your mother, and burn your relationship with her BF. \n\n* You can tell your mother that you think you need to speak to a school counselor about this issue. \n   * This is the soft option because it gives her a chance to back down, but it is still fundamentally a threat so she probably won't be too happy.\n   * If you think your mother would prevent you from talking to the school counselor then you shouldn't tell her.\n* Talk to a school counselor. Specifically mention how the boyfriend keeps walking in on you changing/in the shower. People do better when you ask them for specific help so consider the following:\n   * Would you help me talk to my mother about this issue?\n   * I am feeling really upset about this. Would you listen to me so that I can feel heard?", "NTA. This is not okay, you are absolutely entitled to a sense of safety and privacy in your own home. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with YOU respecting them- this has everything to do with THEM respecting you. Please be safe, don\u2019t hesitate to tell another adult in your life what is going on, and never ever be afraid to speak up for yourself. It takes literally the bare minimum of human decency to knock on a door, and your moms boyfriend is willfully ignoring your request that he do so. I know it sounds kind of childish, but maybe a sign on the door that says \u201cknock please\u201d so there is a constant reminder to both him and your mom that it needs to be done?!", "NTA. You have a right to privacy. Especially at your age. Keep the key. You have a right to feel safe and not have him barging in on you.

I can understand your mom not wanting you to lock the door overnight considering it could be a safety risk but it sounds like not locking is also a safety risk in this instance. \n\nAs others have suggested, I would try to talk to someone at school. Maybe your mom will take your concern more seriously and think about your unease with her bf\u2019s behavior. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t feel comfortable in your personal space.", "Nta.  You're 14.... Plenty old enough to need privacy.", "NTA. This is not ok, he shouldn\u2019t be coming in when you\u2019re sleeping or in the bathroom etc. your mum should take your concern more seriously", "NTA. This sounds kinda suspicious. Try to have a talk with your mom about it. If that doesn't work try talking to a grandparent about it. Sometimes an outside perspective can snap a moms thinking straight.", "NTA.  This is extremely worrying behavior from your mother\u2019s bf.  He should not be entering your room or bathroom without knocking, especially when you are sleeping.  I think you should tell a teacher or school counselor about this.", "NTA - if you don't feel comfortable without that key then what harm can it do to have it.", "His behavior is deeply upsetting and disturbing. So is your mom's. NTA at all babe you keep locking that door and protecting yourself!! Tell another adult if you're able to about what's going on", "Tell another adult, your school counselor maybe. This has really dangerous potential", "NTA - He seems extremely sus", "NTA teens deserve privacy and that can include locking the door.  \n\nPlease bring this up with your school counselor or nurse, that dude is a creep.", "NTA- sorry any adult should be knocking on doors before going into the bathroom or bedroom of a minor child!  OOPs once, then you know. Twice is not a mistake. Plus how did he NOT hear the shower running! He might be cool but I'd not trust him to not sneak peaks at you.", "This is creepy.  A person can hear a shower running, so I'm not sure why he's just walking in the bathroom knowing someone is in there.  Have you asked him to please knock first?  I can't believe your mom wouldn't understand you want your privacy to some extent and dismiss your feelings of discomfort when he just barges in your room.  If he's a \"cool\" guy, you should be able to tell him to stop doing it, and he should respect you enough to stop doing it.\n\nGive the key back with conditions that it needs to stop and you need to be respected too.  It's not asking too much to knock first and wait for permission to enter. \n\nIf it continues, you need to tell an adult you trust outside of the home.  This isn't going in a very good direction so far and your mom doesn't seem to be doing anything about it.  NTA  Good luck!", "NTA.  It sounds like the BF knows full well what they are doing and mom ignoring this is disgusting.  I would raise this with school counselors and/or any trusted adults in a position to help.  Hold your ground OP.", "NTA and you need to get outside help. Talk to your school counselor. Talk to your grandparents. Talk to anyone you can. This is a red flag and 100% creepy behavior. It should not be happening.", "NTA, there is no reason for your mothers boyfriend to be coming into your room when you are sleeping or changing\u2026 and it makes me very uncomfortable that he keeps doing these behaviors. Accidentally coming in once, sure, but this is a pattern. I don\u2019t get why your mom thinks that is ok behavior. Is there a guidance counselor or someone at your school that you can talk to?", "I was somewhat with your mother about the bedroom door to begin with, not the bathroom one. By the time I got to the end, I was entirely on your side l, especially after that edit Holy fucking shit that's not OK.\n\nI will rarely side with a kid over the parent but DO NOT give up that key and explain to your mother and her partner that you are a developing young woman and boundaries NEED to be set. ESPECIALLY with the partner.\n\nOut of curiosity, is there any info you can give about why you're mother is this way about locking the doors?", "NTA\n\nYour privacy and personal boundaries should be respected, regardless of whether you're paying rent or not. It's entirely reasonable for you to want to have privacy in your own room and bathroom, especially when you're changing or showering.\n\nYour mom's boyfriend's eccentric urge to walk in on you while you're changing or showering is a serious cause for concern. He couldn't reasonably have believed that the bathroom was unoccupied unless he's deaf, nor does it seem like he had any good reason to enter your room unannounced.", "NTA and your mom's bf is being creepy.  Tell them that you will bring the subject up to a mandated reporter ar school if they don't let you feel safe.", "NTA.  I\u2019m a mom.  Never have I felt a need to walk into my child\u2019s room when she was in there without knocking.  That is totally weird.", "NTA \n\nHe has multiple times entered into your room without knocking, including when changing and sleeping.  At this point, it's not an accident.  He knows what he is doing. Keep locking your door, and tell your dad or teacher about what is going on. Also, get a rubber wedge door stop to prevent door from opening.", "NTA. Your mom and her bf are disrespectful and creepy. Stand up for yourself and tell an adult that isn't your parents. Tell them EVERYTHING from the very beginning. Some guy you don't know shouldn't be walking into your room unannounced.", "NTA and he sounds creepy tbh, almost as if it\u2019s on purpose. Also, why is he trying to enter while you\u2019re sleeping? That\u2019s weird. \nYou have a right to privacy and safety so don\u2019t give up the key and stand up for yourself even if you get grounded for it. If your mom somehow gets the key then start blocking the door - that way it\u2019s not locked but the bf can\u2019t get in", "NTA. Tell your dad if you're on good terms with him.", "Hell no NTA\nThis is creepy as hell (adult male here, and it creeps even me out).\nYou need your privacy, period.\nOthers suggested keeping the door locked could result in them removing it, but how about an alarm/siren? You can buy one for cheap that resembles a doorstop but when you push a door against it, a little built-in siren goes off pretty loud.\nThat way mom can always get to her baby (might be worried that if you are unwell she can't go through a locked door).\nIf these are honest mistakes, bf would soon learn to knock (so you can kick aside the loud doorstop so it doesn't go off).\nIf bf starts acting even weirder, you will need to report his behaviour. \nAnd I would keep some pepper spray under my pillow, just in case.\nEdit: report him now. Don't wait. If you can contact your father, tell him too, but report officially, leave a paper trail!", "NTA and which mom thinks its right for her bf to see her minor daughter semi naked? Also what's his business in your room? Once you reach teenage, you are an young adult and has every right to privacy like everyone else. Its not like you are a child who cannot unlock the door. What respect is your mom expecting? The right for her bf to see you naked or for him to barge in whenever he feels like? She should be setting some boundaries with him and should be protecting you.", "NTA\n\nI have two teen daughters and I always knock before entering.

She needs to be able to get to you in an emergency.  For example, a cousin of mine wanted to lock her room, and that was fine with her parents.  Three months later they had to break the door down because she was unconscious from carbon monoxide poisoning that nobody had caught (she's ok).\n\nHowever, she needs to respect your privacy and she needs to enforce this with her boyfriend.  He might not mean anything untoward, but this is ESSENTIAL.   I would say, give your Mom the key, apologize for Not Telling Her, but not for Getting the key.  Tell her you'll keep using it to enforce your privacy, but ONLY she can use it in the event of an emergency.\n\nHopefully this works out for ya, kiddo.  I'd hate for you to have to deal with another four years of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT because of your edit about him trying to go in your room.  *What did your Mom say to you about that?
