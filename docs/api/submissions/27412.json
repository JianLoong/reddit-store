He comes over for dinner at least four times a week, my husband gives him rides to work and back, he uses our Amazon account and brings his dirty laundry over for me to take care of it. On our anniversary last week he invited himself to our date. his place still only has a inflatable bed because he \"doesn't need more stuff\". All that still didn't bother me much and I only once or twice asked my husband for some alone time. Now this week my husband was on a work trip and since Chad still doesn't have a car he used my husband's. One day when he called me to ask what's for dinner I asked him if he could stop by a grocery store to bring a ingredient I forgot. He said yes and then showed up without it. He said he forgot about it and he's sure I'll make it work anyway. When I asked if he could go back and get it he refused. That would have been a five minute trip. I went myself, cooked dinner and tried not to be rude to him. I told my husband about the situation and he thinks it's no big deal but I don't want Chad in the house for a while.

For him to expect this from a woman from another culture makes me concerned he thinks this whole babying him and being his defacto mama is part of your culture. Either way, it's disgusting behavior.

Who feels comfortable doing this.", "woman grow some spine and when he ask you to do something for him just say no", "You're not overreacting. This wouldn't be acceptable here, either.", "He\u2019s 45 years old. He can do his own adulting. He can meet people, he can learn to cook and do laundry. He can make the effort to learn the language.\nFoisting his ignorant, lazy ass on someone else is like giving an insurance agent your best friend\u2019s name and number. They\u2019ll hate you forever.", "Well I'm glad it's not racism, but sexism is just as unacceptable. I'm really sorry this little boy in a man's body is taking advantage of your love for hospitality like this. I commend you for keeping your cool as long as you have.", "Glad to hear it! \u263a\ufe0f enjoy your trip away and Chad figures out how to use a laundromat and a bus! \ud83d\ude02", "Good!!! So happy to hear your husband owned this and is taking you away for the weekend! Enjoy you TWO! \ud83d\ude04", "He laughs it off and just throws it in the laundry room. I don't want to be rude but it's just too much by now. Those European dryers take forever and I have to do laundry every day to keep up since he's here.", "My petty as would pick it up and throw it out the front door. The grown up thing would do would be to have a discussion about boundaries. You state your boundaries clearly, no more laundry at my house, cooking for him once a week, I am not your wife or maid or mother etc. then stick with those boundaries. They will say \u201cit\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d You say \u201cit is to me and I won\u2019t be doing it anymore\u201d. They say \u201cyou should be a good host cause I\u2019m a guest.\u201d You say \u201cI did not invite you, you invited yourself. I don\u2019t care if it makes me a bad host I won\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d They bring laundry and it gets put outside undone. He shows up for dinner, \u201cno sorry you had dinner here yesterday you will have to feed yourself.\u201d Stand up for yourself.", "Stop worrying about appearing rude. This man is literally being the rude one TO YOU. I know it\u2019s hard if you\u2019ve been raised to be hospitable but this is waaaay over the line of hospitality. Have your husband set boundaries. If husband shrugs his shoulders, that\u2019s another problem there. He should respect your time and energy and push back on his friend treating you like a maid. \n\nListen, WE teach people how to treat us. So say he throws it in the laundry room and laughs. Pick it up, place it at the front door and calmly tell him, \u201cI\u2019ve been gracious doing your laundry. You are now settled into your own apartment and you are a grown adult and will do your own laundry. I\u2019m no longer doing your laundry.\u201d  Then go about your business. If he is a semi mature adult he will take the hint and not push you anymore. If he decides to goad you or pressure you instead, respond as such \u201cChad, I need you to leave now. This has become disrespectful to me and I mean what I am telling you. I\u2019m done. You can do your own laundry.\u201d \n\nIf you give in, he will keep doing it. Some grown adults are like toddlers. If they throw a tantrum and get their way, they see ZERO reason to change their behavior. Clearly he has NO SHAME in using you.", "Just don't do it? Just leave it there...", "just don't do his laundry."]}
