{"id": 27412, "submission_id": "16pfah8", "title": "AITA for not wanting my husband's buddy of 20 years around anymore?", "selftext": "My (35f) Husband (45m) has a friend, let's call him Chad (45m), of twenty years who moved from the states to our city in europe recently and now works for the same company as my husband. They both don't speak the local language but I do, so when Chad came over a few weeks ago I took a week off work to help him find an apartment, do paperwork, get a phone plan and stuff like that. My husband was super excited that Chad was moving here so I wanted to make sure he feels welcome. I might have been a bit too successful at this. Chad now pretty much lives with us. He comes over for dinner at least four times a week, my husband gives him rides to work and back, he uses our Amazon account and brings his dirty laundry over for me to take care of it. On our anniversary last week he invited himself to our date. his place still only has a inflatable bed because he \"doesn't need more stuff\". All that still didn't bother me much and I only once or twice asked my husband for some alone time. Now this week my husband was on a work trip and since Chad still doesn't have a car he used my husband's. One day when he called me to ask what's for dinner I asked him if he could stop by a grocery store to bring a ingredient I forgot. He said yes and then showed up without it. He said he forgot about it and he's sure I'll make it work anyway. When I asked if he could go back and get it he refused. That would have been a five minute trip. I went myself, cooked dinner and tried not to be rude to him. I told my husband about the situation and he thinks it's no big deal but I don't want Chad in the house for a while.

Not to mention expecting you to make him dinner when his friend isn\u2019t even there. Fuck no tell your husband his friend isn\u2019t welcome or can only come over once a week.", "NTA but you need to assert yourself and SPEAK UP. Tell your husband what YOU are comfortable with and enforce it. It is completely reasonable to not want to do a grown man\u2019s laundry and feed him dinner four times a week. That is ridiculous! Point blank have your husband tell his buddy you are not doing his laundry anymore or feeding him.", "Soooooo NTA - and what the hell is this crap:\n\n*Chad now pretty much lives with us. He comes over for dinner at least four times a week, my husband gives him rides to work and back, he uses our Amazon account and brings his dirty laundry over for me to take care of it.*\n\nHe's a 45 year old man for Christ's sake!  You need to sit your husband down and let him know that YOU are resigning from being Chad's maid/cook effective immediately.  If Chad wants to come over for dinner, husband cooks.  Chad has dirty clothes.  Husband does the laundry.  Chad wants to buy something on Amazon.  He needs to set up an account with HIS credit card.  No excuses.  \"but he doesn't know the language\"  That's on Chad for moving there.  \"but he doesn't have a car\".  Again, on Chad for moving there without a car.  Obviously your husband is over the moon that his best friend has moved into your city, but he needs to start stepping up and put HIS life (i.e. YOU) as the priority.", "You aren't this man's slave.  Let him figure out how to wash his own dirty laundry, gross.  NTA.", "NTA - this is a lot. The dinner thing is petty. But it shows a much larger pattern of him not caring.", "NTA, and my opinion is there is absolutely no reason to have him coming over while your spouse is out of town.", "NTA Chad needs to grow up and GTFO.", "Sounds like you have two husbands.", "NTA. WTH? Your husband wasn't home and he called you and asked what's for dinner??? I would have been like, actually, I'm taking a break from cooking today. Your husband needs to set up some boundaries. Coming over 4x a week is WAY too much. NEVER wash this man's laundry again. I can't believe you ever did.", "NTA\n\nSeems like Chad is trying to fill an empty spot in his life in the wrong way.", "NTA \n\nAnd if that's an auto generated handle, it's hysterically ironic. You are clearly NOT personally resistant. \n\nJust NO. To the laundry, to cooking for him... Anything just no, but friendly. He's treating you like his mom and you need to kick him out your house to find his new life in the new city.\n\nYou need to set boundaries with your husband. Tell him your not interested in taking care of a 45 year old teenager. Your hubs and Chad can hang at Chads place and fend for themselves.", "NTA. Why does your husband allow Chad to treat you like a servant? It's disturbing, tbh.", "Very much NTA, Chad *is* very much the AH. He's taking advantage of your kindness; *you need to stop letting him*. And you need to sit your husband down and both agree on some rules going forward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>he thinks it's no big deal\n\nHe's wrong and you need to put your foot down.", "NTA. Frankly, I'd have a problem if my SO didn't speak the local language. I realize there's not really a timeline on here... but I would expect basic integration if we'd been there for a year: the ability to shop, find a restroom, order food, etc. Having a buddy around that reinforces not having to figure things out would be incredibly frustrating.", "NTA, chad sounds like a child, not a grown adult that's approaching 50. i understand that your husband likes having his friend around, but why are you taking care of his laundry, cooking for him? at this point adopt chad", "You are NTA.  Chad has overstayed his welcome.  It's time for him to back off.   You need to have a conversation with your husband about this & your husband needs to tell Chad he can't come over as much. You shouldn't have to be the one to tell him. But also, he is a grown man, he should know he is overstepping.  Maybe find him a GF?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And you need to speak up. Your husband probably loves having an additional person besides you around that feels like home. But you didn\u2019t agree to be in a throuple.", "NTA. This guy is taking advantage of you and his friendship with your husband.", "NTA - Boundaries need to be set.  He doesn't need more stuff at his palce because he has yours.  Tell your husband he needs to square this away with his friend right away or the next time friend shows up for dinner there will only be two plates at the dinner table, you and your husbands.  And that's it.", "NTA. Sounds like you're the maid you your husband and your husband's husband. He has overstayed his welcome.", "NTA he's way overstepping boundaries. Oof", "NTA at all. My first question would be whether your husband has told Chad that you're happy to do his laundry, as well as all the other things that Chad seems to think are your job. \n\nChad doesn't need more furniture because he knows he can just come to your place and use your furniture, get a free meal, and feels no obligation to do anything in return. \n\nIt sounds like you took on your husband's teenage child.", "As someone who has been through something similar I want to say congratulations on now being the mother to a bouncing baby boy of 45!  This is such a tough situation honestly bc you know darn well Chad is thinking \"These guys are my family.  We are like Three's Company!\" Chad probably loves the dynamic, thinking of you as the sister he apparently never had.  Girl, may patience be with you.  You are NTA for wanting alone time with your husband, but I don't think you're going to find a simple solution unless Chad gets a girlfriend.", "NTA, Chad needs to go.  You're not his servant and if he doesn't know how to cook or wash clothes at 45, he can walk around dirty.", "NTA but you are going to have to be tougher. Tell them both that you are not going to be cooking or doing laundry for Chad, and it is time for him to acclimate. If he can't/won't maybe he can consider going home.", "NTA but are you this much of a doormat to everyone?", "Why are you allowing this? You don\u2019t need your husbands help or permission not to put up with this crap: \n\nHe brings his laundry over. That\u2019s nice. Why is it getting done?\n\nHe comes over uninvited for dinner. That\u2019s nice. why are you making enough food to feed him too?\n\nHe\u2019s rude to you. Ok. Why are you not rude to him?\n\nIf he has had access to your amazon account, revoke it. Or make sure your payment details are never saved so he has to add his own.\n\n He invites himself on your date. Why do you still go?\n\n You have so many options and are using none of them.", "Nta - but you and hubby need to talk about boundaries concerning Chad. He\u2019s leeching off you.", "NTA. \"brings his dirty laundry over for me to take care of it.\" WTF no. \n\nChad can be a friend. He can be a close friend. YOU are not Chad's housekeeper, maid, cook or driver.\n\nMy partner has close friends. I have close friends. Even when we lived close to some, we did not see them this often. \n\nTime to practice saying the word \"No.\"  Your husband is putting Chad's needs above yours. \n\nDo not do his laundry. Do not cook for him. If you choose to cook for him and he was supposed to bring something but did not, make him leave. \n\n\"Chad, you are not welcome here 24/7. If you would like to come to dinner, you need to ask ahead of time. You can do your laundry at your place or use a service. I am not your laundry attendant. I value time with my husband and I understand you do not have many friends here yet, but you will not make any if you are in my house all the time.\"", "NTA. Stop cooking for him. Stop doing his laundry. He's a grown man and he can do it himself. He won't leave as long as you keep doing it. Your husband will guilt you, but it doesn't sound like he's doing this work for him.", "OMFG. NTA.\n\nYou married your husband, not Chad. You need to have a boundaries discussion with your husband like, yesterday.\n\nHe \"brings his dirty laundry over for me to take care of it\"???!?!?!?!?!?!\n\nWhat the hell? I can't believe you have put up with this for this long.\n\nBoundaries, boundaries, boundaries.

Reading this was wild.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend is using you and your boyfriend.", "NTA you have a husband problem. He needs to put up some boundaries with this friend.", "Absolutely speak up. If Chad refuses to buy a washer and dryer, he should be directed to a laundromat. No car? He can take public transportation. If he won\u2019t cook, that\u2019s what takeout is for, etc. OP needs to speak up!!!

Op what are you doing letting your husband put you second to his buddy. Why are you doing his laundry? It\u2019s like you have two husbands. I sense a threesome being asked for soon.

Now I do and just wasn't sure wether I'm overreacting.\n\nEdit spelling", "I've been working overtime to find him someone who's in desperate need of a project. No success yet.", "Because I\u2019ll be d*meed if mine sitting up cooking dinner for my buddy and I\u2019m gone.

Being a doormat is not the way either. He laughs at your   \n\"suggestion\" to buy a washer and dryer because he thinks why would I want to wash my clothes when you do it?\n\nTell him, firmly, I no longer have the capacity to do your laundry. You need to get a washer and dryer immediately. Then hold firm.\n\nThen he doesn't buy furniture because he just spends a ton of time at your place.\n\nStop letting him walk all over you just because you're friends.", "Does he laugh it off and go use your washer himself or laugh it off and push his bag of laundry at you and you take it and do it anyways?"]}
