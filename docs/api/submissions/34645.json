If you can't offer it, you're at least being honest.", "We really need to know the details of why the sister went MIA.", "Yes an AH would abandon their kid, but if the grandparents physically can\u2019t take care of the kid that doesn\u2019t make them an AH. Sending family to foster care when you have the ability to care for them makes you an AH.", "They are clearly of an age where they can make their own choices. They asked OP. The answer is no. Anything after that definitely makes them TAs. \n\nNo is absolutely a complete answer.", "A person has the right to decide how, if ever, to grow their family. It's cool that 3 works for you. That's your choice. Even if it's simply not wanting another human in the home, that's enough.", "An extra doctors/dentists/orthodontists bill is huge, an extra tuition bill is huge. Heck I\u2019m \u201clucky\u201d I was an only child otherwise my mom wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford my braces or helping me with college tuition. You say feeding an extra kid isn\u2019t a lot but over the course a decade it adds up. \n\nOr ya know, if it\u2019s really not that much I\u2019m sure you can kindly donate the $ it costs to raise one child per year for the next decade since you seem to think other people should be responsible for kids they didn\u2019t have a hand in creating.", "Hate me all you want it\u2019s my damn OPINION and I wouldn\u2019t change it even with how hard life is for her because when you love ppl you do what\u2019s right an make it work one way or another if she is so incompetent maybe she shouldn\u2019t have any kids", "Because they are AHs", ">Curious, what does your partner think?  \n\nNot really relevant. This is a two yes one no situation. \n\nEven if OP's partner was ok with it, OP is not.", "I'd like to know, but out of curiosity. But unless OP deleted their own sibling, I don't see how it would affect people's votes.", "No. OP never accepted responsibility for a child they didn't create. OP's parents made a choice. Just like when people choose to risk pregnancy by doing the act that causes it, it's on them to own their choices. \n\nOP has every right to keep their focus on their own children, as those are the lives OP chose to create. \n\nNobody is ever entitled to put their kids on anyone else.", "That's nice. Like any manner of growing your family or not, that's an individual choice. Family planning belongs to the individual, and nobody else.", "I was thinking more along the lines of two firm \"nos\".  There's absolutely no question if both partners aren't on board.", "Ah, got it. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"]}
