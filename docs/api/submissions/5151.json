Water and electricity don\u2019t mix so this should be fixed asap", "NTA, but I\u2019d clearly communicate what has happened. \n\nIf they still won\u2019t listen. Simply have them get shocked by it. Or refuse to shower until they get it fixed. \n\nIt sounds like a wiring/grounding issue. So I\u2019d personally avoid using it until it\u2019s fixed.", "NTA obviously, your mom might not understand what was going on but you\u2019re for sure not an asshole. That sounds scary, I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA - You can\u2019t really control responses like that. Your brain recognized you were in danger and could be electrocuted to death, so all that mattered was *getting away.* Modesty was the last thing on your mind, **as it should be** in a survival situation.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t use that shower again, it sounds very unsafe.", "NTA although your dad is a big one and a cheapskate. How the fuck could he not know the dangers of an electric shower. He should have fixed it on time and your life is definitely far more important than any other crap your useless parents are saying. Lets see how your mom or dad behaves when they get a similar experience, which I hope they do. Also a few people saw you naked, so what? A lot of people gets seen naked and its not a big deal.", "NTA. Your parents more for not getting the instant-hot heater serviced, that's a dangerous situation.\n\nI'm always baffled by floorplans where the main bathroom opens directly into a common living area, that's necessary in a studio apt but otherwise in a house is just weird.", "Oh boo. Someone saw a naked body. They should examine their priorities. NTA", "NTA these things happen at least you are not dead.\n\nTell your mother that it could have killed you and DO NOT USE THAT SHOWER unless it is properly fixed.", "NTA\n\nit's definitely a bit unusual that you ran out of the bathroom totally naked, but considering that you were nearly electrocuted in the shower I think that adequately explains the loss of judgement.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. You could have died. Wet and naked. Mom is TA for saying what she said, dad is TA for not getting the shower fixed.", "NTA\n\nMost people recoil from electric shock. That's a good thing.

The life threatening shower.", "Your parents are stupid, electricity + water is a bad combination.   \nNTA.", "NTA, however I don\u2019t understand why you felt the need to run from the bathroom, surely just stepping out of the shower would\u2019ve sufficed?", "NTA\n\nDid you tell her what had happened? I mean as a parent I would be more concerned that you could've been electrocuted in the bath if the handle shocked you. I would also venture to say your parents are just prude, it's not like we all haven't seen the private parts of the opposite gender. Nobody in your family got excited, so I would've seen it as one of those instances where you are just the source of a joke during family gatherings.", "INFO: were they in the bathroom or were they in a different room and you exited the bathroom?\n\nETA: NTA could you have grabbed a towel? Probably. Is your entire family scarred for life? I\u2019m thinking no. You\u2019re probably more traumatized than anyone else. And your parents need to get that fixed that\u2019s so unsafe.", "NTA. You parents most certainly are AHs for shaming you when you could have died as a result of their negligence. Sorry for your embarrassment. If it ever comes up, make sure your extended family knows the situation was a result of terribly careless parenting.", "100-200mA will arrest the heart. I can't imagine being in a shower and being shocked. Clearly no GFCI on it and that is extremely dangerous.\n\nWho cares if they saw you naked, you needed to get out of danger. Survival is all that matters.", "I mean, NTA but you could have grabbed a towel lol", "\u2026\u2026 they\u2019re more concerned that your cousins got an eyeball full rather than the fact that you could have died????\n\nNTA.

First of all that shower needs to be checked. ASAP. Priority. Your parents need to fix that. Pronto.\n\n Second of all, you don't need to feel ashamed to run out naked when (LITERALLY , not just figuratively) shocked, especially not in your own home.\n Would you have done it if you knew they were there? Probably not (unless you was too shocked to even remember). But alas, it happened, they should have gracefully watched away and ignore the event. So they were the ones not conducting themselves in a civilized manner.\n\nA little story of mine that hopefully makes you feel not alone.\n\nI once accidentally streaked the guys working on our roof, I left the shower naked, carrying the teeniest towel that doesn't really cover stuff, right at the same moment the roof workers (who I didn't even know where there) used a little elevator of sorts to get on the roof and it's position at the time was in the middle of my window. It was the worst timing, I literally stared them in their eyes. Both their faces broke in the broadest of smiles i had seen in a while and till this moment I just try to tell myself I made their day.", "NTA but your parent are for scolding you when you were in an embarrassing situation. You panicked and ran out, that\u2019s understandable, you weren\u2019t thinking clearly. For them to then make you feel even worse about that is an AH move.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA.", "NTA at all. Don't let them guilt you on that. Something similar happened to me, but it was my own fault and stubbornness.  \n  \nTake showers on winter mode now. It sucks, but having to shower worrying about fucking dying isn't nice.", "Facepalm!\n\nSo let me get this straight.\n\nEmergency situation. A situation where actions take president over thought.\nLet's say we agree on that.\n\nSo are you really expected to stand there and die?\n\nMy friends mom got mad at her for sleeping naked. In case the house caught fire was her excuse. I bought her an ankle length bathrobe to leave by her bedroom window. Had it in a wooden box with a glass front that said, in case if fire.\n\nHer mother was not amused.\n\nToday she is married with kids. I met her husband and learned she still has it next to the bedroom window, solely to upset her mother.", "NAH\n\nWhat you did was rational, although why grabbing a towel wasn't instinct is a little unusual. You didn't know anyone was visiting so it isn't like you were trying to put on a show. Your parents are frustrated at what transpired, which is understandable if they don't have the background especially.", "Only takes 1A to kill ya", "This is old school \u201cdrop a live toaster into the bath and die\u201d kind of crap. Your shower is beyond \u201ca problem\u201d every time you use it from now on, you risk death. \n\nGET IT FIXED! And don\u2019t use it again until it is.", "This. And freaking out about getting shocked in the shower is a pretty normal response. Jeez.\n\nNTA, but your parents sure are. \n\nThis is the main reason I won't use those instant water heaters even if they are really energy efficient. It's not worth the risk and the hassle (and the fact that they don't heat the water very well in my experience - I've traveled abroad where absolutely everybody used them).", "This is what i was thinking and meanwhile her family is worried about her exposing her bare chest and body, god forbid! \ud83d\ude44", "This happened to my house too.  I'm not an electrician so I'm not saying it's this but in my case the entire neutral for the house was shot.  This is super dangerous.", "BOOST.  NTA.  But do not go into that room again.", "There are actually shower heads that run plugged in to heat the water; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06w3-l1AzFk\n\nSafer than they sound but still weird to me", "Exactly. How is the issue not that OP was electrocuted?! It\u2019s just a body, we all have one.", "They were pretty common in the UK twenty years ago, and man was it *nice* to be able to take a hot shower that just went on as long as I wanted.", "People who have had a fright don't always act rationally.", "Fight or flight and adrenaline makes you rush out of the danger zone without much thought. For me, I would\u2019ve been concerned that the water could cause a small explosion from the faulty electrical appliance.", "Except it don\u2019t really work like that. \n\nFight or flight means you don\u2019t give two damns how you look, you just need to get out. Fast. It\u2019s how we became the dominant hominid", "Probably because op wanted to get out of the wet area and if there wasn't a fan on the room mightve been humid", "I used to work in a salt water aquatics store and every now and again a pump or something would short and when you touched the water you would get zapped. Mind you, salt water also conducts electricity better than fresh water so it was quite the jolt of adrenaline. I have to say, i never had the impulse to run away or out of the store/aisle after I was no longer touching the thing that zapped me. \n\nLooking at these showers online a majority of the handles are also plastic which doesn\u2019t conduct electricity. I saw some had metallic looking handles (the listing lists the unit is made with copper and plastic and the handle def wasn't copper(prob the wiring inside the unit)) so i tried searching for electric shower w/metal handle and got 0 results. \n\nLike\u2026 this story seems odd to say the least.", "outside", "idk I didnt ask", "Less than that, if you get it across your chest. Much less. About the worst-case scenario is to get hold of something hot with one hand while the other hand is grounded; hand to opposite foot is pretty bad too. Especially if you're wet (as OP obviously was).\n\nThe trip threshold for GFCIs is typically 20mA for a *reason*.", "0.2 is the minimum amperage to kill someone! Electricity is not to be fucked with!!", "huh... That does sound pretty nice!   \n\n\nI have definitely had showers that felt like it they took ages to heat up and I have had showers that gave you approximately 30 seconds of hot water lol. \n\nMy current water heater is one room away from my shower, it only takes about 10 seconds for the water to get hot and I have not had it run out on me yet, and I often take looong showers.", "Right?

Fight or flight doesn't make you do random things and act out of control. If anything it sharpens your awareness and gives you extra focus. This seems weird to me too.

If you exited the bathroom into, say a master bedroom where they happened to be present for some reason, then you\u2019re still not in the wrong. If you exited the bathroom and entered a common area, that was a weird decision to make, but you\u2019re not in the wrong because, hey, you just got electrocuted by a bathtub and probably weren\u2019t in the clearest headspace.", "50mA are potentially deadly, less if you're wet, as your skin resistance is much lower due to the water.\n\nYour skin resistance is around 1k\u03a9 but lower by factor 2-3 when wet... \n\nMeaning, you'll reach the deadly current much faster.\n\nInstant water heaters are built pretty failsafe, but if they fail, they're behind repair and a deadly toy... Throw this thing out immediately!", "They were outside", "Technically electrocuted means death or serious injury lol just a little shock but yeah, still very understandable", "NTA, did you try to talk to them about it? You should."]}
