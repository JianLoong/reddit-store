That sounds scary, I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA - You can\u2019t really control responses like that.

A lot of people gets seen naked and its not a big deal.", "NTA.

I mean as a parent I would be more concerned that you could've been electrocuted in the bath if the handle shocked you. I would also venture to say your parents are just prude, it's not like we all haven't seen the private parts of the opposite gender.

First of all that shower needs to be checked. ASAP. Priority. Your parents need to fix that. Pronto.\n\n Second of all, you don't need to feel ashamed to run out naked when (LITERALLY , not just figuratively) shocked, especially not in your own home.\n Would you have done it if you knew they were there? Probably not (unless you was too shocked to even remember). But alas, it happened, they should have gracefully watched away and ignore the event. So they were the ones not conducting themselves in a civilized manner.\n\nA little story of mine that hopefully makes you feel not alone.\n\nI once accidentally streaked the guys working on our roof, I left the shower naked, carrying the teeniest towel that doesn't really cover stuff, right at the same moment the roof workers (who I didn't even know where there) used a little elevator of sorts to get on the roof and it's position at the time was in the middle of my window. It was the worst timing, I literally stared them in their eyes.

Don't let them guilt you on that. Something similar happened to me, but it was my own fault and stubbornness.  \n  \nTake showers on winter mode now.

A situation where actions take president over thought.\nLet's say we agree on that.\n\nSo are you really expected to stand there and die?\n\nMy friends mom got mad at her for sleeping naked. In case the house caught fire was her excuse. I bought her an ankle length bathrobe to leave by her bedroom window. Had it in a wooden box with a glass front that said, in case if fire.\n\nHer mother was not amused.\n\nToday she is married with kids. I met her husband and learned she still has it next to the bedroom window, solely to upset her mother.", "NAH\n\nWhat you did was rational, although why grabbing a towel wasn't instinct is a little unusual.

And freaking out about getting shocked in the shower is a pretty normal response. Jeez.\n\nNTA, but your parents sure are. \n\nThis is the main reason I won't use those instant water heaters even if they are really energy efficient.

Mind you, salt water also conducts electricity better than fresh water so it was quite the jolt of adrenaline. I have to say, i never had the impulse to run away or out of the store/aisle after I was no longer touching the thing that zapped me. \n\nLooking at these showers online a majority of the handles are also plastic which doesn\u2019t conduct electricity. I saw some had metallic looking handles (the listing lists the unit is made with copper and plastic and the handle def wasn't copper(prob the wiring inside the unit)) so i tried searching for electric shower w/metal handle and got 0 results. Which makes sense because any company with half a brain would not put a metal handle on something that goes to an electric switch AND will have water touching it.\n\nLike\u2026 this story seems odd to say the least.", "outside", "idk I didnt ask", "Less than that, if you get it across your chest. Much less. About the worst-case scenario is to get hold of something hot with one hand while the other hand is grounded; hand to opposite foot is pretty bad too.

Electricity is not to be fucked with!!", "huh... That does sound pretty nice!   \n\n\nI have definitely had showers that felt like it they took ages to heat up and I have had showers that gave you approximately 30 seconds of hot water lol. \n\nMy current water heater is one room away from my shower, it only takes about 10 seconds for the water to get hot and I have not had it run out on me yet, and I often take looong showers.", "Right?

Your flight or fight response kicked in and you flew the hell out of there. Yes, it was embarrassing, but not your fault. It was an accident that other family members saw you.

Everyone uses them.", "90% of showers in Brazil are electric showers. It\u2019s pretty standard in many places. It just should be made safely; unlike what OP has, unfortunately.", "We had those growing up. Hot and cold taps and stuff like that was either foreign things or rich people things when we were kids. \n\nEven into young adult\u2026", "But if there's no water tank to run out, how will my wife know when to get out of the shower.", "well since you worked with these appliances and somewhat expected the shock, it\u2019s definitely different. it\u2019s your job to manage such things i would assume and so of course you wouldn\u2019t freak out as much as someone who is in their own home and not expecting to get shocked.", "*me silently thinking back to the time I shocked myself across the arms with 500v playing with components*", "It makes you run out of the danger zone and not take any extra steps. The danger zone was the shower and the bathroom, and her body and mind acted accordingly, getting her out of there as quickly as possible.\n\nShe got shocked by the shower, and she was wet. Very dangerous and deadly combination. If the electrical part of the shower was exposed, it could\u2019ve even caused a small explosion. It\u2019s reasonable to get away from that fast, and taking the time to grab a towel is unnecessary and keeps her in the line of danger. Her mind didn\u2019t process it as *running towards people* but as *running away from immediate danger.*", "It also suppresses cognition in favor of faster reaction times. And a number of other things. And it's not like a split second thing that's over as fast as it starts. It starts in a split second and lingers for anything ranging from minutes to days. Sometimes longer with major trauma.\n\nPeople do all sorts of things under fight or flight that they would normally consider illogical or flat out stupid. You don't think until after you've already acted. So while it doesn't exactly make you do random things outside of your control, it kind of does. In that you do something that seems like it's safe to the stupid lizard brain that has temporarily hijacked your body. You can learn to control it, sure, but that's not really going to apply to a situation like this since it requires building strong habits. Examples, training for military personnel or therapy for PTSD. If you aren't prepared for the threatening situation, there's always a very good chance you do something that makes little to no sense."]}
