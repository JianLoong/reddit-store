I told her I didn't want another mom. She was sad but said she understood. They married a few months after that and then when I was 9 she and my dad sat me down and told me she wanted to adopt me and that she loved me so much and her dream was to be my mom. I told them I still didn't think of her as my mom. She asked if I loved her enough to try, to give it a shot and we could wait on the adoption until I was ready. I said I didn't want to. She then said to do it because I loved her. Dad said there was no woman more deserving. I told them I didn't love her enough to let her be my mom. She cried. My dad told me he didn't know why I was lying but therapy would help me see I loved her.\n\nI did go to therapy. I didn't change my mind on letting her be my mom/being adopted by her. So they tried to have a baby of their own. She was not able to get pregnant but they abandoned the idea of her getting her motherhood dreams out of me, which was good. But she couldn't get pregnant and so IVF was their next step. I'm not sure on all the details but they only got enough for one try and they waited and prepped her so the pregnancy would stick. She made it to 14 of 15 weeks and then she miscarried three weeks ago. It was bad. She was broken and she ended up staying in the hospital so they could help her.\n\nMy dad decided that now I need to give her what she wants. That 10 years of knowing her and 9ish years of her being his wife means she has been my mom whether I like it or not and I need to start showing her that I love and care about her. He told me the adoption would mean the world to her and would be the biggest help while she grieves. I told him I had enough and his wife's grief was not enough for me to let her adopt me.

I told him I'm a real person, his son and mom's son and while I don't know her, you can't just ask someone to be adopted to give another person their dream.

Honestly it sounds like they've sabotaged her chances of having a healthy loving relationship with you by trying to force the issue. You can't force someone to care about someone, that's just not how feelings work. They need to start respecting how you feel. Honestly I do feel sorry for this woman - it sounds like she's been through some serious trauma - but it's not your job to fix that for her.", "NTA. You have a mom, & it doesn't matter if you remember her or not. She carried you, she gave birth to you, & your dad is wrong for trying to erase her existence as your mother. I understand your step mom loves you. And that's OK, you don't have to love her as a mom. You don't have to treat her as a mom. As long as you treat her respectfully and as a person. Has she mentioned it again since the miscarriage, or is it all your dad?", "NTA. Oh ducking, my heart breaks for you. You lost your mum, then your dad and step mother fell in love with the idea of a perfect family - it was never actually about you. \n\nYou deserve better from the adults in your life. You are not a bad person for not wanting to be a kid-shaped prop in their lives. I wish you all the best for next year when you hit 18 and can begin to set boundaries as an adult with then both.", "NTA\n\nCould you possibly stay with your grandparents or other family? You are nearly 18. I would start planning your exit strategy now. You gave the most logical explanation possible (which massive kudos for your emotional intelligence) and was told your lying. \n\nHe doesn't see you as his son anymore, only an obstacle to his wife's happiness. I am sorry OP. Keep the family that loves and treats you right close.", "NTA. Sorry but this woman sound like she needs help mentally.

You are not a emotional support animal as well. You never viewed her as a mother and simply because your dad and stepmother want it won't change it.\n\nI disagree with one point. You do know her for quite some time now.  \n  It does seem to me that you never really wanted or cared for a relationship, but that is still  your choice.\n\nAdopting will make her a mother on paper not in real life  \nMy thinking is that they think when your stepmom will be your legal mom on paper she can get to parent you. That ship has long sailed. You are nearly an adult.", "NTA. I\u2019m also petty and I would change my last name to my moms family name.

It\u2019s weird.  They need therapy to flesh this out and to understand and respect your boundaries.   FYI, I have a wonderful stepfather.  But I\u2019ve always called him my stepfather out of respect for my actual father, whom I also love.  Same with my step mother.  I love her, but she\u2019s not my mom so I don\u2019t call her mom. It\u2019s pretty simple really", "NTA but this story is so brutal. Dad\u2019s wishes are reasonable, step-moms wishes are reasonable, but pressuring you is not reasonable. My heart breaks for everyone, but breaks harder if you were adopted for unrequited feels. Emotional extortion is a horrible reason to be adopted.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and his wife did everything they could to make sure you never want to go anywhere near her.\n\nJust tell them to adopt some orphaned child or something, maybe their insanity will end up in something good.", "NTA \n\nAdoption needs to start with the child in this sort of scenario, and definitely not brought up after a few visits", "NTA. They should never have tried to force this on you and the sad reality is that you could have ended up being more amenable to it had they let the relationship develop naturally.", "I think there is a lot of possibilities for your relationship with her to flourish. The thing is, it was ruined because they forced it to you so aggressively and so early.", "NTA at all, maybe they should go find a kid who needs to be adopted & stop trying to force her dream of motherhood on you", "NTA\n\nYour dad told you that you were lying about not loving her and therefore needed therapy. Do I detect an odor of gas lamp in the room...\n\nIn all seriousness though, her grief does not mean she is owed something from you that you do not feel. And even if you did feel comfortable with the adoption and all that, it doesn't seem like your dad and stepmom would stop there as they have yet to respect your boundary. \n\nIf she wants a child, then there are countless children in foster care and group homes around the world dreaming of a loving family. When she is ready, she and your father can look into those options. But under no circumstances is she owed you as her child.", "NTA Your feelings are totally valid and you shouldn\u2019t be forced into changing your mind however I would still try to be there for her in any other ways you can/are comfortable with because what\u2019s she\u2019s going through is one of the hardest things someone can go through and even if you don\u2019t feel for her that much she clearly cares a lot about to you and it\u2019s kinda just basic empathy to help a human being going through that much pain if you can also I think the saying you don\u2019t love her seems unnecessary and a bit cruel like if I think of mean things to say to someone who cares about me that\u2019s pretty up there on the list especially when you consider what she\u2019s going through but I can also understand how you might have been fed up with the harassment to change your mind or that something that extreme needed to be said to get your point across since nicer ways of saying it didn\u2019t seem to work", "NTA, if this is real your emotional maturity is off the charts", "[deleted]", "NTA. But i would assume after all these years you have a parent-type bond with her that would create closeness.

She was diagnosed with BPD, so I hold resentment (as she constantly asked me to be her adopted daughter, while trampling my boundaries and abused my brothers and I the whole time) and I am currently in therapy for it. \n\nThe fact BOTH your parents stomped all over your boundaries, and kept pushing it? Disgusts me. You are completely right. You have an identity already, and you made your decision already. Their beliefs should not be shoved down your throat.

Though I think she's coming from a good place, that doesn't really make her and your father's behavior ok. But I do also feel as young as you are, you don't fully understand why adoption can be beneficial. If something, God forbid, happened to them, you would get any life insurance policy money, the house they live in if they own it, etc. If you're not adopted, somebody else in her family could make a claim to half the house. Though a will and making you a beneficiary would give protection, a family member could potentially contest it. With adoption, you're officially her next of kin so you would be fully protected.

You appreciate the love and support you got through those 10 years from both of them\n2. You recognize the good things they have done for you\n3. While your mom has passed, she is still your mom and you remember her\n4. Being adopted by stepmom would mean that you erasing her and her memory\n5.

This is ultimately your choice and you thought that he loved you enough to understand your decision\n7. While you understand that she is destroyed by this loss (and I\u2019m sure that you do feel bad), forcing this adoption would tarnish your relationship with both of them and might kill it fully\n8. Not being adopted doesn\u2019t mean that she has failed as a \u201cmom\u201d and she would be a better \u201cmom\u201d if she let this go\n9. Lastly, parents are supposed to sacrifice for their children not the other way around\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP that your dad is being a jerk. I never lost a parent, but I had step parents. I still call my half siblings \u201cMaman *her first name*\u201d (we are French and it means mom) as she loved me like her own and deserved that title. But you see, she didn\u2019t want to replace my mom. She was the best parent I had when I visited my abusive dad. \n\nIf your dad doesn\u2019t understand, clearly tell him that adoptions don\u2019t go through unless the adoptee agrees. And you explain to him that you will fight it the whole way.", "NAH - but I feel like compassion and understanding should be the responsibility of both. I can only assume that Dad waited 6 years to be serious with someone, most likely due to his own grief and not wanting another person in your life at such an early age. That is very considerate. Your Dad too suffered a truly emotional Trauma. Understand that he actually interacted, loved, and was in the process of building a life with your mom. His loss should be acknowledged, appreciated, and respected the same as yours.  After 6 years, and being a responsible adult, he made a conscious choice to move forward with someone who could be a mother to you. He understands the importance of this influence in your development.\n\nYour fathers wife is trying to connect with you. Absent a traumatic incident between you two, is she at any fault for being loved and respected enough by your father to be introduced to you? \n\nEveryone you described in your post, OP seems to have tried to engage you in many meaningful ways. Why is that wrong? Someone openly stated they were willing to commit the rest of THEIR life to you (adoption). That\u2019s amazing to have an adult want to do that - many kids will be wards of the State until they are 21- meaning they will have no parents or foster parent.  I think Your perceptions of while they tried to conceive may be off. They are adults in a marriage and would otherwise be expected to start a family- like your Father and Mother did with you.\n\nGiving her a real chance to be a positive and major influence in your life does not dilute your feelings or loss of your own mother. In fact spiritually, some might say this woman was placed in your life because you never had that opportunity to have a true mother. At this point I\u2019m sure the emotional damage on both sides is deep and irreparable, but you have to ask yourself- what did SHE really do to become the target of your vitriol? \n\nTake some time to process, and also time to understand the viewpoints of Dad and \u201cwife\u201d.", "NTA.

She just wanted you as a physical prop or toy as you said, but without the actual relationship.

However, the role she has been doing her best to fulfill seems to be earnest and unconditional despite how often/hard you reject it.

She doesn't want to get out of bed to take you to school, attend a recital, drive with you to an appointment, etc.) If she put the same amount of distance from you that you do towards her, she would have pushed for your father to take on all the responsibility and duties for your care. This isn't uncommon on this subreddit where the stepchild is completely neglected regardless of age. (ie. Stories where the stepchild is at home and the \"husband's wife\"/relative/etc wants nothing to do with the care even in emergencies and call the cops/CPS.)\n\nOn the other hand, view it from her perspective.

Even though you do not love her, you cannot just chalk her feelings up to an 'I am just a placeholder for her ideal family'. You cannot know that is how she has felt towards you because of your bias. \n\nThis story struck a cord with me partly because this is personally my worst fear.

I never tried to force the relationship. I didn't tell him I loved him until he said it first. I never forced him to call me \"mom.\" I would have liked to adopt him and he wanted me to as well, but we've never had the money for the lawyer (his bio mom may not be in the picture but she also won't give up her rights) but if he said \"no\" when asked, I would have let him know that he can always change his mind and to let me know if he does, and then I never would've brought it up again.

I have adopted three kids. I understand in a blended \"family\" feelings towards each other can be different. Two of my kids were adopted at 9 and 11. I understand that loss is complicated and that replacing the role of a biological mother can never happen. That said, I commend your militant defenses but hasn't it been long enough?! Seriously though! I think she wants to be part of the family and for her it means being your mom. And while it's not that straight-forward, I would suggest you both could find a more middle ground and it doesn't have to be either/or. This mom labels seems like it's causing you both some stress. Maybe you should redefine that for yourself. I am sure your mom would want you to feel part of a \"unit\" and ultimately that's what i think your stepmom wants. Her grief will be bad right now, not only because of her loss but because of the huge hormonal changes. I had 5 miscarriages and know a bit about this. I would suggest define this mom role and offer that to her. Make a list of all the things that would be ok for her being for you - I am happy for you to be my mom if it means this = examples: like getting to be her no 1 young person, being there for you when you have an emergency, being able to buy you treats, clothes, things for no reason, being the person who helps with school/college/work issues, helping finance your life, supporting you with relationship questions, helping organize birthday parties...oh you can list I am sure pages of stuff that if you said to her...I give you this as your responsibility...she would love! And that for her would mean being a mom. Most of all, I feel this for you is such an important relationship for you to figure out and resolve. It will impact you in every aspect of your life and help you with future relationships. When you marry (if you do) and have kids, this will be one person that you can pull up in front of the in-laws and it means more to have a functional rather than dysfunctional family. Dysfunction causes a lot of stress! I have worked hard at gaining the trust of my 9 year old who is now 18 year old daughter. She is a senior has a GPA of 3.8 and is bi. I try to support her where I can, we have a bit of conflict between us at times, she seems to feel safer and happier around my husband. But one thing I am clear about is that the world is tough and she is a creative scatterbrain like me and also strong-willed. I want to make sure she knows I have her back and when I call her on her stuff it's because I want more than anything in this world for her to be safe. I am sure more than anything that is what your stepmother wants - is for you to be safe in this world too. Regardless of her personality, knowledge or experience, she has something to offer. Some things aren't just happenstance so I would suggest you also write a list of what you could offer her and how that can be a keg in the wheel of your family. We need more people on our side not less. I know regardless of what my 18 year old daughter thinks of me, I have her back. I would literally take a hit for her...I would walk across coals to save her and I would stand up to anyone for her. I know more than any of the silly arguments we have or her belief that maybe I don't quite get her (but she is so like me she doesn't even realize lol) that ultimately me making sure she is safe is the most valuable thing for her and I will continue to do that god darn it! Can't you just let your stepmom be that person for you too?", "NTA. It's good that you had therapy, but did you ever go as a family so the therapist could help them understand how you feel? And has your stepmom gone to therapy for her infertility and now miscarriage? It sounds like they've put all the work on you when really as the adults they need to be the ones to do it, and to accept reality as it is instead of forcing others to be what they want.", "YTA. So her crime was that she came on too strong when you were 7 years old. And you have held this grudge for a decade? She sounds like she just wanted to love you and fill a maternal role for you. You are right that they should not have pushed the adoption on you...but after 10 years of having this woman in your family, how can you not care about her or love her? It's so cold and I feel so sorry for her. You've had this wall up since you were 7, at any point did you even consider examining why or opening yourself up to this relationship? \n\nWhat do you gain by continuously rejecting her? She clearly loves you and at this point she IS your family. I honestly feel sorry for you too, I think you have so much resentment and anger built up that you are incapable of letting people in. Your dad's wording was pretty bad, but you should consider therapy. Not to make yourself love her, but to unpack why you are incapable of accepting her and letting go of your birth mother who you didn't even know. It's like you have an idealized version of your real mom made up in your head that no real person can ever live up to. I really hope you do open your heart and find compassion one day.", "Maybe I am off-base here, but I wonder if you are taking out your feelings about your dad moving on too fast and pushing the relationship on you. From what you describe, your dad is the one being pushy and manipulative. If stepmom\u2019s worst offense is being too eager to be a part of your life, I wouldn\u2019t call that AH behavior. If she had approached you in a more laid-back way and your dad wasn\u2019t pushing you, would you feel differently about her? To be clear, I don\u2019t think you should give in about the adoption, but as you get older I hope you can at least give her a chance.", "Lol I've seen a variant of the \"Over-imposing stepmother wants to replace my real mother\" story so many times here. It's getting old at this point.", "NTA. These people are emotionally abusing you. I suggest getting away from them as soon as you can.", "I think what the step-mother really wants is validation, recognition that she filled the mother role in your life, even though you never saw her as your actual mother.\n\nI'd sit down with her and let her know that you recognize she always filled that role for you and that you haven't always been grateful for all that she has done for you. But you do care deeply about her and love/respect her as a member of your family. Think back to some over-and-above things she's done for you and tell her you are grateful for her love, caring and humanity in a very difficult situation.\n\nThen tell her that as much as you love and respect her, allowing her to replace your biological mother goes against all that you are as a person. Tell her that you've always grieved not having the chance to know the woman who gave birth to you and that you feel reserving the mother spot in your heart for her is your way of keeping her memory alive. Ask her kindly to respect that need you have as much as you respect her for marrying a man and caring for his child as though they were her own. Add some mumbo jumbo about how there is a special place in heaven for people who give so much of themselves and ask so little in return and end with a nice hug.\n\nI guess, what I'm saying is that your stepmother needs therapy, seriously, she does. You don't have to smooth things over but it would the humanitarian thing to do because at the end of the day we're all flawed people just trying to see our way though the flawed world we live in.\n\nIf she's not been shitty about anything else besides this why not make the effort not to judge her on her weakness when you could easily give her respect, recognition and validation she needs to feel better about this situation?", "NAH...yeah, this is going to surprise some people.\n\nYou and your father are both dealing...or really, NOT dealing...with your grief over your mom. Yeah, if not properly handled, grief can last a lifetime and can make people do things that undermine their chances to find any kind of real happiness again.\n\nYou may THINK you don't remember her, but you do. And your grief is taking the form of your refusal to allow this new person into your life at all.\n\nYour father, on his end, is trying to recreate a \"happy family\" in the mistaken belief that this will make his grief go away. It won't, even if you were to agree to this charade. And all he's doing is guaranteeing that this won't happen.\n\nMIL just walked into a firestorm that is way more complicated than she could understand, and she ALSO couldn't look past her own wants enough to know she was cutting herself off at the knees by pushing when she should have just held back and allowed things to happen as naturally as possible. PERHAPS a bit overly pushy...well, more than perhaps. Which suggests SHE is also dealing with other issues that have gone unresolved.\n\nThis whole situation is excruciatingly sad.\n\nSo yeah...everyone just need to STOP. Mostly the adults, because they at least SHOULD know better than this. And a lot of folks need to stop pushing against a wall that won't budge and consider the value of some couch time to get to the REAL root of what's driving the train here.\n\nBut you can't force love. You CERTAINLY can't force family. You can certainly force a wedge in that will never get pulled out.\n\nAll I can suggest, OP, is that while you should hold our ground on any official titles, try to find SOME space in your heart for this woman. She doesn't sound like a bad person overall. And you might be surprised to discover that you can open your heart to her WITHOUT losing any of the love you feel for your mother and her family. It will NOT be the act of betrayal you now think it is.\n\nTrust me...other people are going to come along in your life looking for a place in your heart. You keep that thing locked up, you're going to find it hard to let them in, as well.

What her being your \"mom\" (allowing her to adopt you) changes about your situation\n6. What her being your \"mom\" (allowed to adopt you) changes about her situation\n7. What her being your \"mom\" (allowing to adopt you) changes about your dad's situation\n8. What might have been different\n9. What \"developing naturally\" looks like in your imagination\n10. What \"developing naturally\" looks like in reality\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I have no idea what you believe the word \"mom\" represents to you - it's different for everyone. You don't remember your mom, so I'm not sure that what you think the experience is actually is different from what you experienced with her.\n2. No idea what it means to her beyond the fact that she clearly wants to be a mom to you, so I imagine that it also means feeling that her love is being returned.\n3. The rest of the world typically means someone who has provided a maternal figure complete with nurturing, affection, and acceptance, as well as protection. \n4. Your dad clearly feels that a mom is a co-parent that acts the way your step-mom has acted with you.\n5. Let's say you allow her to adopt you - what does this actually change about your life?\n6. Let's say you allow her to adopt you - beyond injecting an immeasurable amount of happiness because it symbolizes to her that you have stopped rejecting her - what does it change about her life? Would it change the nature of your relationship?\n7. Same - beyond making your dad happy because you have made your step-mom happy, what does it change for him? This is an easy one - if he dies, he knows that the woman who has been helping to raise you for 10 years will get custody. And, in case you were wondering, that would likely still be her if he has a will, he would likely name her your guardian. It would just make this less messy with the courts.\n8. What might have been different if they had handled this differently? What would it have taken for you to allow her to adopt you? What would it have taken - what is necessary for you to acknowledge that she is the only mother you will ever know?\n9. I'd love to know the answer to this\n10. In reality, relationships don't \"develop naturally\". Relationships are about appreciation, communication, trust, and setting boundaries. The healthier the relationship, the more of all of that you have. And in reality, you were an obstacle to letting that relationship develop \"naturally\". When you first met her, she was a stranger, and it was weird for you that she wanted to fill a role in your life that had previously likely only been filled by your imagination if you thought of it at all (what it would be like to have a mom). Because you felt she was being pushy, you dug your heels in. That never changed and you don't seem to have questioned why you have been digging in your heels since you were 7 - you just keep doing it. Maybe it feels like it would be a betrayal of the mom you never knew. Maybe you have spent so long looking for reasons to reject her that its become a habit. The bottom line, however, is that you don't seem to have any appreciation for her and what your life might have looked like without her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor each of us, there is a \"last time\". \n\nThere will be a last time she asks you to accept her as your mother. You won't know its the last time, because we never do.\n\nBut one day you will realize that you had your last opportunity to show her how much you appreciated having her in your life, instead of the blank spot in your memories that would have replaced her. \n\nAnd that will be something you will have to live with for the rest of your life. You can tell me you won't regret it, you can act like you don't care, but I expect that in the 10 years that you have lived together she has done more than simply ASK to be your mother. I'm confident she's ACTED as a mother. I'd be willing to bet that when you were sick, she took care of you. When you were sad, if she had an opportunity, she would try and comfort you. It sounds like even though you repeatedly rejected her, she kept coming back, while still doing her best to give you the space that you clearly wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 17, even after never knowing your birth mother, you don't quite have the life experiences under your belt to realize what a heavy blow it can be to lose someone who has been a fixture in your life. There are abuse victims that mourn the passing of their abusers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd one day, your step-mom is going to die. Nothing you think about or do today can prepare you for what that will be like. You can't imagine what it will be like to lose her forever. But on the day it happens - your world will change and it is likely that you will be inundated with regrets. \"If only,\" \"I wish,\" - you just can't know what you will want to change about the past before you lose someone. You sometimes truly can't appreciate someone until they are gone...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope for your sake Op, that you think about these questions and at the very least consider how you can make your step-mom at least FEEL APPRECIATED for all that she has done for you over your life. She is in pain. She is grieving, and as someone she cares about, you can bring her some comfort.\n\nIt wouldn't require you to allow her to adopt you even. It would just take you acknowledging who she is, what she has done for you, and admitting at least to yourself that  mom or not, you are lucky to have had her in your life.\n\nBecause you have been lucky to have her. Boy you don't eve know how lucky you are, and that might be the most tragic thing of all.", "To be quite honest, though, I get the feeling you were very, very resistant in all of this. From what you've written, it really does sound like this woman made an effort to care for you but, you ultimately and continually shut her down simply because she wanted to play a motherly role in your life. I'm curious, if you had it your way, what should she have done? What does \"develop naturally\" look like to you?", "This is the way my stepdad always was. I'm very close to my bio dad, he's my best friend. But when my mom started dating again and my stepdad came around, he was just this goofy guy who treated my sister and I really well and just always started looking out for us just like he does for his own girls. He didn't try to take dad's place, but he made it clear if we wanted it we were his girls too now. \n\nI've told him for years now how lucky we are that we got a bonus dad. And he tells us how lucky he is to have four daughters.", "Tangential, but why do shitty dads always seem to beeline for the cheapest, most rash-inducing and skin-irritating pieces of jewelry they can possibly buy? Where do they even find this stuff? Are they running a factory?", "This is great! Like you said, when it's real, you don't need a piece of paper for that", "Oh yeah. Parents like this really hate it when the therapist doesn't take their side.", "Yeah the sentence \u201ctherapy would help me see i loved her\u201d irked me as well. Thats not how therapy works dude. Its nit some kind of tool to force other people to be what you want them to be. The contrary. It helps them to understand who they are and what they want.", "You're right, but it sounds like this scenario predates them trying for a kid. Could be that the woman got into this relationship knowing she would struggle to conceive, and thinking a ready-made family would fill that need.", "Niiice", "> I want to know what it is that OP takes issue with the stepmom about\n\nSometimes there's no issues and the kid just simply doesn't want to be adopted by a new parent, it takes a lot of time, paperwork, court appearances, and that is a lot to deal with, even if those aren't the reasons and they simply just *don't want to be adopted* that is a perfectly acceptable decision. I have a wonderful relationship with my stepmom, but I would never want to be adopted by her, there are kids who *do* want to be their stepparents adopted kids but OP is just not one of them.", "It is absolutely abuse to force a child into the role of emotional support for a parent.  Speaking as someone who was forced into that role.  I spent ten years of my adult life trapped in a city I hated continuing my role of emotional support for my mother to prevent her from commiting suicide before I decided she was an adult and if she wanted to off herself it wasn't my responsibility.  It's unbelievably fucked to put a child in the position of needing to provide emotional stability for adult.", "Perfect summary.", "Ahahah ofc I\u2019d miss that xD", "Mmm...I would give an AH to the Dad for pushing on this. And there seems to be a push from the SM as well. \n\nOP is definitely NTA though.", "If it were just about wanting the son and stepmother to get along, I would agree. But expecting the son to completely erase his mother and accept this woman in her place is unreasonable.", "OP hasn't mentioned anything the step-mom did wrong except want to be his mom. Set the bar as high as you want:  She sounds like a great great person from the post. \n\nOP is angry she asked to adopt him. But I also get the sense OP would have been enraged no matter what she did. Like if she never asked to adopt him, he would be posting \"i hate my step-mom because she never asked to adopt me! She was waiting for ME to ask HER!\" - I dont know if thats true, but thats the sense i get from OP. He hates the step-mom and just gathers whatever he can to back up that hatred.", "This lady told OP she *loved* them after 3 meetings with them, that would push anyone away imo. Let's say your mom died when you were born and dad got a new gf when you were 8, gf starts love-bombing every time she sees you and just puts on the whole \"oh I *love* you so much, I'm going to be your new mommy!\" act from the moment you meet her, that is an uncomfortable position to put a child in, if gf were to let the relationship build *naturally* then OP could have felt differently over the years and actually *wanted* gf to adopt them.", "I don't think forcing and moving the relationship too fast  that op can't prosses it well is very little reason so no not ungrateful", "You're not being \"attacked,\" you're being called out. That tends to happen when you push a toxic narrative on a teenager and try to make them feel guilty for not loving someone who has put them through a decade of emotional abuse and manipulation. Love isn't a transaction where you put time in and get someone to feel the way you want in return. \n\nIt would be one thing if she had been part of his life for so long while also being respectful and appropriate and OP just resented her for no reason but that isn't the case. Instead she and his father spent that entire time trampling his boundaries and pressuring him to feel a certain way. That's abuse.", "Take time to build up a friendliness. Take an interest in my interests. Let me know stuff about her. Ask about me. Don't bring up her being my mom, adoption or love right off the bat. Take time to get close to me and see what happens naturally. Don't try to be a parent right off the bat.", "> Honestly, at this point, aren't you holding out to punish her?\n\nProjection? Is there something you need to confess to?", "That's stalker talk.\n\nOnly *her* feelings matter, not those of the child.\n\nYears ago, I met someone who knew when he met me that he wanted me to be his wife. I had no idea, and went on a date. One.\n\nHe was educated, handsome, comfortably off. His feelings were front and centre in his life. He wanted me to meet his mom and sister, wanted to give me lifts to work, wanted us to share all our hobbies.\n\nHis feelings were genuine, he was not threatening but he was suffocating. I actually got out of his car, when he was driving me to the next part of the date, whilst we were at traffic lights. I fled that first date.\n\nThis woman told OP she loved him having seen him 3 times previously. It freaked him out. She continued pushing for acceptance *on her terms.*\n\nIt has permanently freaked him out.", "It's funny how OP's dad thought therapy would \"fix\" the problem---it's if professional therapists just do the parents' bidding and brainwash child patients to be good little boys and girls. Not how it works; not even a little bit.", "So much this.  I was adopted as an infant, my Mom and Dad are the people who adopted me.\n\nOddly, yesterday morning Dad gave me an envelope with my background details in, and info about my bio-parent.\n\nno names for the bio-parents, but - it had my original name listed.\n\nthat's a weird feeling, to find out something as central as your original name 54 years later.", "Comment stolen from the actual OP further down.", "Can confirm my Mum hated my psychologist.", "Y'know making someone's account of their childhood trauma all about you is very... huh.", "I'm glad you're doing the work, but the truth is that the **entire function** of a label like BPD is to provide a useful descriptor for a constellation of behaviors and tendencies. When this commenter describes being raised by someone with BPD and being resentful, we all understand that to mean **not** \"I found out private medical information about my foster mom's diagnosis and hated her for it,\" but rather, \"my formative caretaker engaged in behavior consistent with this complex personality disorder, and it left me traumatized and resentful.\" The commenter could sit down and list specific ways their foster mom harmed them, but by mentioning their foster mom's BPD, we can fill in the gaps.\n\nPeople with cluster B personality disorders aren't monsters, you're right. And it's tragic in a way that cluster B PDs generally stem from childhood trauma too. But part of managing a disorder like that is fostering a hyper awareness of how the tendencies of these disorders, when left unchecked, *do* inevitably harm others.\n\nI have loved ones in my life with cluster B personality disorders, one of whom has BPD. I wish with all my heart they would get help and work to manage their disorders, but they're unwilling to. I'm glad you're willing to put in the work, and I wish you luck.", "There just seems to be this quid pro quo happening here. She treats him nice, so now he owes her. Not how parenting works. They should have just let it happen organically but they didn't.", "...I feel like we read two entirely different posts. I don't get that impression of the OP at *all.*", "If my mum died when I was a baby and I had zero memory of her then I would probably be happy to have a maternal figure who genuinely loved me.\n\nBut that's not actually relevant. I'm not saying waiting for a natural relationship to form wouldn't have been better, I am saying that OP still sounds like an ungrateful kid for everything the step mom will have done that means nothing to them", "I think that's an excuse to hold on to for a decade. It's not great, but it's not some heinous crime.", "Yes, this!", "Thank you for posting this! I\u2019ve been trying to find it but forgot what it was called", "This song really hits.", "Please delete your account.", "You are doing exactly what OP's stepmom is doing: Completely ignoring his feelings and acting as if love is some form of currency. A step-parent does not have a right to be loved by their step-child, no matter how many 'love dollars' they invest in them.\n\nThe stepmom pushed a relationship that wasn't there for OP and turned what should have been a slow process into a constant irritant. You can't form a bond at a point that's been rubbed raw.\n\nStepmom didn't want OP as a son, she wanted what she imagined OP 'really' was if he would just stop pretending not to love her. It's the same for his father.", "I was thinking the same thing while reading the comment above. Why are we not letting kids have their own feelings about things. She is not owed his love. \n\nIm sure there is a stalker somewhere who loves his victim, would we think the victim is obligated to love them back, hell no. So that doesn't make sense.", ">You should love someone thats been there for you and raised you for 10 years.\n\nYou *shouldn't* love anyone that you don't love. You either love someone or don't. It's not something you can force, and it's not something you can guilt OP about.", "No one should love someone who doesn't respect their boundaries. Expecting someone to because of the length of time they have been around is a disgusting mindset. All of this could've been avoided if she just took a step back and let things happen on his terms in a healthy manner. Forcing a relationship never works nor is it healthy at all.", ">You should love someone that's been there for you and raised you for 10 years. \n\nReally? So OP doesn't get to choose? As long as she's not outright abusive, he HAS to love her?\n\nWhat an appalling take on the parent-child relationship. Almost makes it transactional.", "[removed]"]}
