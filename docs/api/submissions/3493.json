Dad met his wife when I was 7. They were together for 6 months when she told me she loved me (after meeting her three other times before that) and she could not wait to give me another mom. I told her I didn't want another mom. She was sad but said she understood. They married a few months after that and then when I was 9 she and my dad sat me down and told me she wanted to adopt me and that she loved me so much and her dream was to be my mom. I told them I still didn't think of her as my mom. She asked if I loved her enough to try, to give it a shot and we could wait on the adoption until I was ready. I said I didn't want to. She then said to do it because I loved her. Dad said there was no woman more deserving. I told them I didn't love her enough to let her be my mom. She cried. My dad told me he didn't know why I was lying but therapy would help me see I loved her.\n\nI did go to therapy. I didn't change my mind on letting her be my mom/being adopted by her. So they tried to have a baby of their own. She was not able to get pregnant but they abandoned the idea of her getting her motherhood dreams out of me, which was good. But she couldn't get pregnant and so IVF was their next step. I'm not sure on all the details but they only got enough for one try and they waited and prepped her so the pregnancy would stick. She made it to 14 of 15 weeks and then she miscarried three weeks ago. It was bad. She was broken and she ended up staying in the hospital so they could help her.\n\nMy dad decided that now I need to give her what she wants. That 10 years of knowing her and 9ish years of her being his wife means she has been my mom whether I like it or not and I need to start showing her that I love and care about her. He told me the adoption would mean the world to her and would be the biggest help while she grieves. I told him I had enough and his wife's grief was not enough for me to let her adopt me. I told him I did not think of her as my mom, I did not love her, I was not a toy that could fill her motherhood desire. I told him I'm a real person, his son and mom's son and while I don't know her, you can't just ask someone to be adopted to give another person their dream.

Honestly it sounds like they've sabotaged her chances of having a healthy loving relationship with you by trying to force the issue. You can't force someone to care about someone, that's just not how feelings work. They need to start respecting how you feel. Honestly I do feel sorry for this woman - it sounds like she's been through some serious trauma - but it's not your job to fix that for her.", "NTA. You have a mom, & it doesn't matter if you remember her or not. She carried you, she gave birth to you, & your dad is wrong for trying to erase her existence as your mother. I understand your step mom loves you. And that's OK, you don't have to love her as a mom. You don't have to treat her as a mom. As long as you treat her respectfully and as a person. Has she mentioned it again since the miscarriage, or is it all your dad?", "NTA. Oh ducking, my heart breaks for you. You lost your mum, then your dad and step mother fell in love with the idea of a perfect family - it was never actually about you. \n\nYou deserve better from the adults in your life. You are not a bad person for not wanting to be a kid-shaped prop in their lives. I wish you all the best for next year when you hit 18 and can begin to set boundaries as an adult with then both.", "NTA\n\nCould you possibly stay with your grandparents or other family? You are nearly 18. I would start planning your exit strategy now. You gave the most logical explanation possible (which massive kudos for your emotional intelligence) and was told your lying. \n\nHe doesn't see you as his son anymore, only an obstacle to his wife's happiness. I am sorry OP. Keep the family that loves and treats you right close.", "NTA. Sorry but this woman sound like she needs help mentally. She can\u2019t conceived so you have no other choice but to be her daughter. She\u2019s the one who should seek therapy. It sounds scary to me\u2026", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right to say you\u2019re not a toy for your step mother to fulfill her fantasy. Yes it suck she can\u2019t bore a child of her own but what your father said and tried to do are all wrong and misguided. Also you\u2019re no longer some child now too, even if you do somehow agree to the adoption, there\u2019s nothing much for her to mother you about. \n\nBoth of them are the ones who need therapy, not you.", "NTA.  \n'I I told him I did not think of her as my mom, I did not love her, I was not a toy that could fill her motherhood desire. I told him I'm a real person, his son and mom's son and while I don't know her, you can't just ask someone to be adopted to give another person their dream. \n\nThis OP, this. You are not a emotional support animal as well. You never viewed her as a mother and simply because your dad and stepmother want it won't change it.\n\nI disagree with one point. You do know her for quite some time now.  \n  It does seem to me that you never really wanted or cared for a relationship, but that is still  your choice.\n\nAdopting will make her a mother on paper not in real life  \nMy thinking is that they think when your stepmom will be your legal mom on paper she can get to parent you. That ship has long sailed. You are nearly an adult.", "NTA. I\u2019m also petty and I would change my last name to my moms family name. She can be his only family at that point.", "NTA: This is insane. Your dad and stepmom are doing everything you should NOT do to a divorced child.", "NTA your dad and his wife acted very stereotypical, they pushed and demanded instead of just allowing for the bond to grow naturally\n\nSo obsessed with becoming a family they forgot to think about your needs/wants\n\nThey caused this and even now the child still gets the unwarranted blame\n\nYou can have compassion for her without being the one that fulfills her dreams of becoming a mom", "NTA, looks like you don't need a \"new mom\" because you lived your whole life like that.\nWhy don't your dad and stepmom just adopt a child, that doesn't have parents and needs a loving place to  grow up in?", "NTA. You can\u2019t force affection nor do you owe someone your affection. You can be grateful to someone for raising you, but you don\u2019t have to call them by a \u201ctitle\u201d you aren\u2019t comfortable using.", "Not sure why the parents are pinning all their emotions/happiness on you and the adoption.  It\u2019s weird.  They need therapy to flesh this out and to understand and respect your boundaries.   FYI, I have a wonderful stepfather.  But I\u2019ve always called him my stepfather out of respect for my actual father, whom I also love.  Same with my step mother.  I love her, but she\u2019s not my mom so I don\u2019t call her mom. It\u2019s pretty simple really", "NTA but this story is so brutal. Dad\u2019s wishes are reasonable, step-moms wishes are reasonable, but pressuring you is not reasonable. My heart breaks for everyone, but breaks harder if you were adopted for unrequited feels. Emotional extortion is a horrible reason to be adopted.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and his wife did everything they could to make sure you never want to go anywhere near her.\n\nJust tell them to adopt some orphaned child or something, maybe their insanity will end up in something good.", "NTA \n\nAdoption needs to start with the child in this sort of scenario, and definitely not brought up after a few visits", "NTA. They should never have tried to force this on you and the sad reality is that you could have ended up being more amenable to it had they let the relationship develop naturally.", "I think there is a lot of possibilities for your relationship with her to flourish. The thing is, it was ruined because they forced it to you so aggressively and so early.", "NTA at all, maybe they should go find a kid who needs to be adopted & stop trying to force her dream of motherhood on you", "NTA\n\nYour dad told you that you were lying about not loving her and therefore needed therapy. Do I detect an odor of gas lamp in the room...\n\nIn all seriousness though, her grief does not mean she is owed something from you that you do not feel. And even if you did feel comfortable with the adoption and all that, it doesn't seem like your dad and stepmom would stop there as they have yet to respect your boundary. \n\nIf she wants a child, then there are countless children in foster care and group homes around the world dreaming of a loving family. When she is ready, she and your father can look into those options. But under no circumstances is she owed you as her child.", "NTA Your feelings are totally valid and you shouldn\u2019t be forced into changing your mind however I would still try to be there for her in any other ways you can/are comfortable with because what\u2019s she\u2019s going through is one of the hardest things someone can go through and even if you don\u2019t feel for her that much she clearly cares a lot about to you and it\u2019s kinda just basic empathy to help a human being going through that much pain if you can also I think the saying you don\u2019t love her seems unnecessary and a bit cruel like if I think of mean things to say to someone who cares about me that\u2019s pretty up there on the list especially when you consider what she\u2019s going through but I can also understand how you might have been fed up with the harassment to change your mind or that something that extreme needed to be said to get your point across since nicer ways of saying it didn\u2019t seem to work", "NTA, if this is real your emotional maturity is off the charts", "absolutely NTA, however i do want to clarify some points\u2014does your stepmother take care of you? contribute to household finances? live with you? you refer to her as \u201chis wife\u201d though you\u2019ve both known each other so long. have you spoken to any of your birth mother\u2019s family about this?", "NTA. But i would assume after all these years you have a parent-type bond with her that would create closeness. If not, and it sounds like not, perhaps your feeling of alienation from her has a cause that needs to addressed together? \n\nAnyway, best wishes.

She was diagnosed with BPD, so I hold resentment (as she constantly asked me to be her adopted daughter, while trampling my boundaries and abused my brothers and I the whole time) and I am currently in therapy for it. \n\nThe fact BOTH your parents stomped all over your boundaries, and kept pushing it? Disgusts me. You are completely right. You have an identity already, and you made your decision already. Their beliefs should not be shoved down your throat.

How does it hurt you at all to be adopted? \n\nI come from a complicated family. I have a biological father. An adopted father. And a stepfather, though he passed away last summer.\n\nI don't even remotely see my dads as equivalent. They're not.

Though I think she's coming from a good place, that doesn't really make her and your father's behavior ok. But I do also feel as young as you are, you don't fully understand why adoption can be beneficial. If something, God forbid, happened to them, you would get any life insurance policy money, the house they live in if they own it, etc. If you're not adopted, somebody else in her family could make a claim to half the house. Though a will and making you a beneficiary would give protection, a family member could potentially contest it. With adoption, you're officially her next of kin so you would be fully protected. It sounds like she loves you very much, and wants her assets to go to you. So maybe think a little more about the big picture?", "ESH She doesn't understand that you can't force someone to love you. And you need to understand that just by adopting you she isn't replacing your mom. And looking from legal side it may be beneficial to you. \n\nInstead of being so cold-hearted how about you spend some time with her, go to a movies or a walk with her and just build more friendly relationship rather then mother son one.

OPs stepmom and father have been completely inconsiderate by forcing a relationship and to accuse the OP of not having feelings when she has stated she is emotionally closer to her grandparents and other people in her life is absurd and just trying to guilt OP for having valid feelings of resentment towards her stepmom. OP had no choice in who raised her, she was literally a child. A child is supposed to be nurtured not be an emotional support person for a stepmom who clearly lacks boundaries.
