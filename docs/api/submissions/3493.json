They married a few months after that and then when I was 9 she and my dad sat me down and told me she wanted to adopt me and that she loved me so much and her dream was to be my mom. I told them I still didn't think of her as my mom. She asked if I loved her enough to try, to give it a shot and we could wait on the adoption until I was ready. I said I didn't want to. She then said to do it because I loved her. Dad said there was no woman more deserving. I told them I didn't love her enough to let her be my mom. She cried. My dad told me he didn't know why I was lying but therapy would help me see I loved her.\n\nI did go to therapy. I didn't change my mind on letting her be my mom/being adopted by her. So they tried to have a baby of their own. She was not able to get pregnant but they abandoned the idea of her getting her motherhood dreams out of me, which was good. But she couldn't get pregnant and so IVF was their next step. I'm not sure on all the details but they only got enough for one try and they waited and prepped her so the pregnancy would stick.

Honestly it sounds like they've sabotaged her chances of having a healthy loving relationship with you by trying to force the issue. You can't force someone to care about someone, that's just not how feelings work. They need to start respecting how you feel. Honestly I do feel sorry for this woman - it sounds like she's been through some serious trauma - but it's not your job to fix that for her.", "NTA. You have a mom, & it doesn't matter if you remember her or not. She carried you, she gave birth to you, & your dad is wrong for trying to erase her existence as your mother. I understand your step mom loves you. And that's OK, you don't have to love her as a mom. You don't have to treat her as a mom. As long as you treat her respectfully and as a person. Has she mentioned it again since the miscarriage, or is it all your dad?", "NTA. Oh ducking, my heart breaks for you. You lost your mum, then your dad and step mother fell in love with the idea of a perfect family - it was never actually about you. \n\nYou deserve better from the adults in your life. You are not a bad person for not wanting to be a kid-shaped prop in their lives. I wish you all the best for next year when you hit 18 and can begin to set boundaries as an adult with then both.", "NTA\n\nCould you possibly stay with your grandparents or other family? You are nearly 18. I would start planning your exit strategy now. You gave the most logical explanation possible (which massive kudos for your emotional intelligence) and was told your lying. \n\nHe doesn't see you as his son anymore, only an obstacle to his wife's happiness. I am sorry OP. Keep the family that loves and treats you right close.", "NTA. Sorry but this woman sound like she needs help mentally. She can\u2019t conceived so you have no other choice but to be her daughter. She\u2019s the one who should seek therapy.

You are not a emotional support animal as well. You never viewed her as a mother and simply because your dad and stepmother want it won't change it.\n\nI disagree with one point. You do know her for quite some time now.  \n  It does seem to me that you never really wanted or cared for a relationship, but that is still  your choice.\n\nAdopting will make her a mother on paper not in real life  \nMy thinking is that they think when your stepmom will be your legal mom on paper she can get to parent you. That ship has long sailed. You are nearly an adult.", "NTA. I\u2019m also petty and I would change my last name to my moms family name.

It\u2019s weird.  They need therapy to flesh this out and to understand and respect your boundaries.   FYI, I have a wonderful stepfather.  But I\u2019ve always called him my stepfather out of respect for my actual father, whom I also love.  Same with my step mother.  I love her, but she\u2019s not my mom so I don\u2019t call her mom. It\u2019s pretty simple really", "NTA but this story is so brutal. Dad\u2019s wishes are reasonable, step-moms wishes are reasonable, but pressuring you is not reasonable. My heart breaks for everyone, but breaks harder if you were adopted for unrequited feels. Emotional extortion is a horrible reason to be adopted.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and his wife did everything they could to make sure you never want to go anywhere near her.\n\nJust tell them to adopt some orphaned child or something, maybe their insanity will end up in something good.", "NTA \n\nAdoption needs to start with the child in this sort of scenario, and definitely not brought up after a few visits", "NTA. They should never have tried to force this on you and the sad reality is that you could have ended up being more amenable to it had they let the relationship develop naturally.", "I think there is a lot of possibilities for your relationship with her to flourish. The thing is, it was ruined because they forced it to you so aggressively and so early.", "NTA at all, maybe they should go find a kid who needs to be adopted & stop trying to force her dream of motherhood on you", "NTA\n\nYour dad told you that you were lying about not loving her and therefore needed therapy. Do I detect an odor of gas lamp in the room...\n\nIn all seriousness though, her grief does not mean she is owed something from you that you do not feel. And even if you did feel comfortable with the adoption and all that, it doesn't seem like your dad and stepmom would stop there as they have yet to respect your boundary. \n\nIf she wants a child, then there are countless children in foster care and group homes around the world dreaming of a loving family. When she is ready, she and your father can look into those options. But under no circumstances is she owed you as her child.", "NTA Your feelings are totally valid and you shouldn\u2019t be forced into changing your mind however I would still try to be there for her in any other ways you can/are comfortable with because what\u2019s she\u2019s going through is one of the hardest things someone can go through and even if you don\u2019t feel for her that much she clearly cares a lot about to you and it\u2019s kinda just basic empathy to help a human being going through that much pain if you can also I think the saying you don\u2019t love her seems unnecessary and a bit cruel like if I think of mean things to say to someone who cares about me that\u2019s pretty up there on the list especially when you consider what she\u2019s going through but I can also understand how you might have been fed up with the harassment to change your mind or that something that extreme needed to be said to get your point across since nicer ways of saying it didn\u2019t seem to work", "NTA, if this is real your emotional maturity is off the charts", "[deleted]", "NTA. But i would assume after all these years you have a parent-type bond with her that would create closeness.

She was diagnosed with BPD, so I hold resentment (as she constantly asked me to be her adopted daughter, while trampling my boundaries and abused my brothers and I the whole time) and I am currently in therapy for it. \n\nThe fact BOTH your parents stomped all over your boundaries, and kept pushing it? Disgusts me. You are completely right. You have an identity already, and you made your decision already. Their beliefs should not be shoved down your throat.

Though I think she's coming from a good place, that doesn't really make her and your father's behavior ok. But I do also feel as young as you are, you don't fully understand why adoption can be beneficial. If something, God forbid, happened to them, you would get any life insurance policy money, the house they live in if they own it, etc. If you're not adopted, somebody else in her family could make a claim to half the house. Though a will and making you a beneficiary would give protection, a family member could potentially contest it. With adoption, you're officially her next of kin so you would be fully protected.

She just tried to get what she wanted but even at 7 I was a person with my own feelings and thoughts and did not just want a new mom forced on me.\n\nI didn't say I would do everything for myself at 10 but I didn't go to her when I needed help or wanted to learn something or even wanted something. I went to my grandparents and my aunts for those things. She still did them and she didn't have to, I acknowledge that, but it didn't make me love her either.", "And it would be great if she allowed the kid to recognise that over time instead of going \"I'M YOUR MUM NOW\" from moment one.\n\nI don't get how you're surprised that's impaired the chance of that relationship forming right from the off.", ">She has done all of the work of being a mom\n\n***stepmom** Let's not let your personal issues get that twisted. Would you be making this nonsensical argument if bio-mom was still in the picture...?", "OP didn't demand that from her. Besides, she is an adult that has OP under her care, it's her duty that she accepted when she married a man with a kid. And children, like any person and regarding any type of relationship, don't work like vending machines \u2014 insert favors and get love. You build and earn a bond (not necessarily the title of \"mom\", though) by being nice and respectful of boundaries. However, if you try to force it, you'll likely get the opposite. And rightfully so.\n\nShe should be working out her issues, not making them OP's, or any child's, responsibility to solve.", "I mean she doesn't have to do it but then the dad doe, not op, it's the parent aka dads' responsibility to do all the mom things if mom isn't there.\n\nAlso, children do NOT owe their parents or guardians or caregivers anything, filial piety is such a stupid concept.", "Which one, you had a lot of questions. I can't speak for her if that's the one you mean.", "Fair enough. You just seem so set against having even the slightest amount of compassion for this woman.  Why is that? Because she tried too hard? Seems odd to me. Does your mom's family dislike or resent her?", "And she rushed it. She expected within a year that I would love her and want her to be my mom. That is super fast. Then when I didn't want that her sadness was put on me, and then it happened some more uny she decided to focus on having a kid of her own. But it's not like at any point she tried to build a friendly relationship. There was always one end goal; for me to be her son, for her to get her dream of motherhood, ideally through me. \n\nMy mom's family don't hate her but they don't know her the best either. Neither do my dad's family either though.", "Well that's very sad. I feel bad for all of you. Maybe your could tell you dad that you would like to be able to have a normal relationship with her but you haven't felt you could since he has been pushing this agenda. It's really not normal that you feel no compassion for this woman , you basically grew up with, that just had a miscarriage 3 weeks ago. She is truly going through something that's extremely hard and your dad is not helping at all here. He needs to learn how to support her with out putting it on you.", "It's not even that I lack any sympathy for her. But I don't want to be used as her comfort, because then she'll totally lean on me and it will bring up that desire to adopt me again. She already started showing signs of wanting to cling to me again. But she hasn't brought up adoption again. I do expect it will happen. If my dad had his way I would have no say in it.", "OP lacking compassion is something you inferred on your own. Or made up.\n\nFocus on what was said instead: compassion doesn't enter into anything. He rejected her, and keeps rejecting her, for his own valid reasons. And making him lunches and driving him to school doesn't have anything to do with it either."]}
