They say nothing about when they plan to do it instead. I see the message a while later and have to inquire as to when they will make it up. They say 5 days. 5 days pass and they have another excuse why they cant do it. Again, they say nothing about when they intend to do it instead and I have to ask. They say a few days, and again have an excuse. Schedule for another few days later, and they again have an excuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn each instance of them saying they can not make it, they do not reach out to me to tell me they aren't coming. 1 hour before the time, I write to ask if we are still on, but get no reply. 30 mins before time, I write again, but again no reply. Several hours later, or the following day, they reach out and give some excuse as to why they couldn't make it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this occurs repeatedly I get a bit aggravated and tell them, \"It is ok if you need more time, but you could at least have the courtesy to tell me you are in town and available to do the job you agreed to but you are not feeling up to it, instead of just leaving me not knowing.\".   \n\n\nThey treat it as if it is no big deal, but I emphasize that it is indeed a big deal to me and I find this behavior unacceptable and they should not ask me for help in the future. I follow up and qualify by saying:  \n\n\n\"Why would I continue helping you all the time if you repeatedly cant even be bothered to take 30 seconds to write me (even though you had time to be on Facebook posting stuff) to tell me that you aren't going to do what you agreed to do?\"  \n\n\nIn response to this they blow up on me saying things like:  \n\n\n1. \"I don't have to be held accountable for my actions. You are not my boss or my parent.\". \n2. \"I shouldn't get in trouble or feel like I have to waste so much of my time and energy trying to make you not bitch at me.

The action I took that should be judged is that I decided to cease all future financial help to this person. \n\n2. The action that might make me as asshole is that I complained at them instead of just letting it slide again like I have in the past, and I also made the decision to stop helping my friend.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your friend is a raging solid gold grade A certified asshole.", "NTA. I would consider if you should even be continuing a friendship at this stage. Your $50 is gone. Be thankful they showed you their true colours over $50 and it wasn\u2019t more. Count your losses and move on.", "You\u2019ve learnt two valuable lessons here:\n1. Never give payment until the job is done\n2. This person values your friendship less than they value $50. \n\nTime to find a new hairdresser. \n\nNTA", "NTA it was a paid exchange for services that aren't executed. This doesnt sound like they value you - I'd ditch the friend and find a way to extract my cash, you got written receipts? . Personally if I'm paying someone privately for a service, friend or otherwise I make sure it's a digital payment so I can get the money back if its not executed. But tbf good friends I'd let hold my 50 in the good faith they would give it back (thats a very small group). If your friend doesn't manage their finances well, keep your cash in your pocket.", "NTA.\n\nThey asked for money and agreed on the terms. Getting paid extra for a haircut sounds like a great, honorable way of helping someone out monetarily. Your friend should really care more about their reputation.", "Thank you to everyone who replied here. I am kind of a pushover in many areas of life, especially when it comes to long time friends, and anytime one of them gets upset with me I look for external opinions to see if I am missing something, overlooking something I did, or if I just have unreasonable philosophy. You all have helped me to not give in and let it slide again.", "NTA. But I wouldn't have this person cut _my_ hair.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t let them near my hair again. You may not be their boss, but you are their client. If they don\u2019t work then they can get cut loose and are easily replaceable.", "NTA - tell them they have made it clear that they do not wish to honour your agreement, and consequently, you require the $50 paid back immediately.
