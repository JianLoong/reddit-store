Further into the planning of the wedding it all changed without us knowing, SIL sent pics of the dresses and everything with the costs including the costs of the dresses. Then I was sent all this stuff about a hen do that was going to cost a fortune that i could not afford. I sent the screenshots to my mum because she was paying for my hair, etc. Never did she say anything about paying for the hen do which is fair enough. My mum then spoke to SIL about this and asked her about the dresses and she denied ever agreeing to pay for the dresses however mum had evidence she did and showed it. \n\nI ended up stepping down as a bridesmaid because it wasn\u2019t going to be affordable for me and funnily enough she only ended up having her sister as a bridesmaid as the other 4 all dropped out too. \n\nEver since this SIL was never the same with us, blunt and always rather awkward.

First question comes to mind\u2026where is your brother in all this?  If he is staying out of it, or invariably sides with the SIL, he is helping to perpetuate the trauma, and enabling her tantrums and issues.  Have you talked to him about this?  He\u2019s kind of the nexus in all this.  It\u2019s unfortunate for you, your mom, and your niece, but I wouldn\u2019t be looking for your SIL to start acting differently without some good reason.

Why isn't he clearing anything up and communicating? That's something that will become important as the relationship continues and the fact that he wasn't mentioned but once in this conversation is concerning. My spouse and I deal with our parents ourselves, I don't deal with their mom, they deal with their mom, I deal with my mom and they do not.", "To try and give more details. My brother backed his wife throughout the argument, says he never noticed her being rude and awkward. They few times they have visited us she always goes in a mood and goes into the room and he always makes excuses for it. She definitely had post natal depression after birth so we understood and tried to be as supportive as possible during this period but mostly were met with more rude and awkward behaviour. My mum is the most kind generous person ever and it breaks my heart to see her being treated so poorly.", "Info: was your brother and mom's relationship solid before this?\nIt really seems like something is missing here.", "My brother sadly somewhat enables her behaviour from what I see. I understand it is his wife, however he would be nothing without our parents and should not allow such treatment towards our mum. I tried to talk to him about it and he was just rude towards me and said some unforgivable things that he had no idea about so we don\u2019t have a relationship currently. It\u2019s been going on for so long and I try not to think about the situation because it truly hurts me but my mum went to visit again today (they meet at my grandmas never their house since the argument) for his birthday and is yet again left upset due to her granddaughter not really knowing who she is and SIL ignoring her. It frustrates me I feel helpless and don\u2019t know what to do", "I\u2019d love to know myself. He does not seem to pull her on her behaviour because if he did why would she continue?? I have no relationship with my brother currently due to this so I don\u2019t know what happens behind closed doors but I suspect not much.", "What was your relationship with your brother like before SIL entered the picture? Is there any way to connect with him directly? If so, try that. If not, then your options are very limited.", "It was good, we lived separately from him being 16 and me 11 due to our parents divorce he ended up living with my grandma but he\u2019s always been a great big brother before she entered the picture. I just don\u2019t know how I can connect with him anymore I love him but he isn\u2019t the person he used to be and I don\u2019t know how I can forgive him after all of this. Im thinking therapy might help me because it all just hurts and I don\u2019t know how to handle it", "This is a tremendously hurtful situation but it\u2019s not yours to resolve. I hope you do find a good fit as a therapist because you would absolutely benefit from guidance in navigating your complicated emotions.\n\nOne of those complicating factors: You don\u2019t really know your brother, due to age and upbringing differences. Another: You don\u2019t know anything about your brother\u2019s relationship with his mother.\n\nSeparate yourself, even if only mentally/emotionally. Don\u2019t get enmeshed with other people\u2019s choices.", "Thank you for your words, it\u2019s really comforting to hear other perspectives so I appreciate it. I hope for all of us we find a way through this and can somehow be a family again"]}
