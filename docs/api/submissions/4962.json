But not so wrong that it would warrant a reaction like this.", "People are taking it way too far tbh. The rule is that you don\u2019t wear a white gown that looks like a wedding gown. \n\nWhite is NOT entirely off- limits and guests should be free to wear cream and beige linens at summer weddings.", "I need to find a mechanic shop where all the mechanics are required to wear white lacy gowns. Regardless of gender.", "Lol", "I mean, if your idea of hitting on someone is telling them you're wearing \"tighty whities\"...", "The lanyard isn\u2019t an issue for me and is silly. But I strongly suspect the lanyard isn\u2019t why the bride is upset", "Oh how i wish i could gold you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23", "Yeah like... When did it become a thing where Weddings are a license just to be a control freak?\n\nHere's an idea: be less of an AH so that you have enough friends that you don't need to invite people that would rather pick up extra shifts than be at your wedding.", "I don't think I've worn anything BUT a white dress shirt to a wedding. Well, I usually also wear pants, socks, etc...", "Next thing you know guests won\u2019t be allowed to wear white underwear in case trousers rip or the dancing gets a bit rowdy.", "Then the bride needs to use her big girl words and express that, not just say it's because of the lanyard, which is what she's claiming is her issue. Which is what caused OP to write this whole thing.", "Me too! Hilarious", "I used my free award to silver this for you", "Well, here is to the best SATUR-DAY night!

He doesn\u2019t have to go if he doesn\u2019t want to. In fact if it came to my wedding I would rather someone not go if they don\u2019t want to be there.\n\nWeddings are all expensive 50,60,70 dollars a plate.\n\nThey way he made it sound he left really early because he didn\u2019t want  to be there anyways. Only there because his mom who is giving him free rent wanted him to be.\n\nDid he stay for the meal they paid for.\n\nNo one has to like weddings and it would save the bride and groom money to not go if you don\u2019t want to be there"]}
