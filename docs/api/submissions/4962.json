You weren't wearing a white dress or a jacket, that reaction is just insane. Not surprised you didn't want to go there", "NTA\n\na MALE with a white patch and a lanyard being mistaken for the bride???  Unless you are missing out some vital information ie the lanyard was a diamante encrusted 8ft lace veil with the majority of it attached to your head and only a tiny corner tucked into your pocket as you processioned out of the room humming \"here comes the brde\" I think there is a strong possibility that the she was being a complete idiot.", "OMG tell bridezilla to get over herself!!!! What you were wearing is in NO comparison to wearing white to someone\u2019s wedding!! Not even a little bit! Maybe she was stressed, maybe she\u2019s just a bridezilla, probably both. But you did absolutely nothing wrong. And anyone who is agreeing with her are just as ridiculous as she is!", "NTA. You showed up which was more then you wanted to do. and you were polite when leaving.\n\nNo one is entitled to your time.", "NTA, obviously you had a negative attitude towards the wedding, for some reason, but you didn't show it, you kept it to yourself. Also the bride getting mad at a little white lanyard, she needs to chill a bit. I'm a woman and I probably wouldn't even notice.", "NTA. Only a part of your outfit was white. You didn't wear a full-on white dress.", "NTA.  Thats bridezilla territory right there", "The snark in me is thinking I would have told the bride I was wearing tighty whities; would she like me to remove them?\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  The bride is being stupid.  The idea is that nobody should be wearing an outfit that could get them mistaken for the bride, which is why nobody else wears white dresses.  It doesn\u2019t mean nobody attending can have a stitch of white on.", "NTA but seriously dude you weren't doing anyone a favor by going to the wedding and you could have easily changed into your work clothes at work.", "NTA and the bride is being ridiculous. She took time from her \u201chappiest day\u201d or honeymoon to text you, a family friend, about a lanyard? That little thing \u201cruined\u201d her wedding!\nI\u2019d text the groom that you promise not to wear white to his next wedding.", "A lanyard and a patch were white? And the bride complained you were wearing white? Bahahahaha \ud83d\ude02 Is this a scene from a sitcom? Does anyone else find this hilarious? NTA", "She was looking for a reason to be mad. Everything else went fine, so unfortunately bridezillah saw you, and locked onto target. NTA\n\nShes being ridiculous. And anyone whos joining her, loves drama and gossip. Stay away from these people, they sound toxic AF. Good luck Op.", "For the uniform? NTA\n\nBut if you didn't want to go you shouldn't have gone", "NTA for wearing a little white.... A lot of men wear white dress shirts to weddings, after all. If it wasn't an emergency you should have stayed.", "NTA lol. My grandma wore a full white dress to my wedding, which was annoying, but I didn't even notice until I saw pictures later and I never said anything to her. A lanyard??? Come on. That's just silly.

I don't think I've been to a wedding where there wasn't at least 50 dudes in white shirts, a bunch of kids in white or a bunch of women in simple white dresses.\n\nA white patch on your work uniform set her off when everyone else is in white too, crazy.", "YTA. You are not even allowed to think about the color white, on this, the day of someone's wedding. /s", "ESH, I think (although the bride is more bananas). You weren\u2019t wearing white and her complaint is ridiculous. I do think changing into a mechanic\u2019s uniform and then going back into the wedding to let people know you were leaving was the wrong way to handle it, though.", "YTA. Just for your general attitude towards the wedding", "YTA for attending the wedding in your work uniform in general. The color isn't really the issue here. You made it clear you didn't care about the wedding and couldn't even bother with slacks and a button down shirt. If you have to go to work later you change in your vehicle.", "NTA.\n\nBut to be honest, while I think I'd have left the wedding in work clothes as you did, back when I was age 19-ish - I'm older now and would be more discreet.  \n\nI would take the extra time to change my clothes away from where anyone in the wedding party could see me. Even if it means doing so at work. I think the whole white lanyard thing is ridiculous. But walking out in one's work clothing is a bit of a faux pas in my mind. Not to any AH level. More like side-eye.", "NTA\n\nThis girl couldn\u2019t handle anyone having even a little bit of white on? What? Is someone gonna mistake a white patch on a uniform shirt for her?", "Not the asshole\u2026 Some people really do try very hard to find something to be mad at\u2026 She sounds insufferable", "NTA. Your uniform didn't even have that much white on it. Unless you rolled in wearing a wedding gown or white tux with tails, I think you're good.", "MTA.  Tell the bride you\u2019re sorry so many people mistook you for her\u2014 you know, with all the white you were wearing", "NTA- the don't wear white rule is like an entire outfit. People wear little bits of white all the time to weddings- shirts, white is sometimes in prints or embroidery on otherwise not white outfits... I would've assumed that your uniform might've been more of an issue than the lanyard. I realize you were probably in uniform for a short time, but that would've been a bigger issue to most people.", "Unless your lanyard was attached to a full-length, white gown-- NTA.", "Were you mistaken for the bride??? NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou were not wearing a white gown, your clothing had some white on it.  The bride having a fit about it is the one being ridiculous.", "NTA. What an asinine thing to be upset over. She sounds terrible.", "NTA\n\nDoes that mean that there wasn't a single man at the wedding wearing a white shirt?\n\nThis no white at a wedding has absolutely gone ridiculous.\n\nI saw one where a guest got kicked out for wearing white nail varnish and another where MiL got kicked out for wearing pearls.", "Its a wedding. You're male. Typical wedding attire for men are black suits with white dress shirts. Assuming you were dressed traditionally and this was a wedding with a traditional dress code... werent you wearing white already? What about the other men?? You werent wearing a whole god damn John lennon abbey road cover white suit. Bride needs to fucking chill. Literally nobody would've noticed. Is she gonna complain if someones grandma had come with her natural white hair?? NTA", "INFO. So you went to the wedding in your work uniform?   Why?  And if you didn't go in your uniform, then how did you manage to change into it to THEN come back to say goodbye to the groom?", "Wtf NTA", "NTA, she's an asshole for even calling you up. If the bride has an issue she can call you up and directly deal with getting told that she's being ridiculous. As of yet you don't even know if the bride does have an issue, or if your sister just being an asshole.", "Why does that rule even apply to him? Its apart of his uniform. I kind of thought that only applied to not wear a white dress to a wedding. I didn\u2019t realized it applied to suits too.", "He didn\u2019t have to work.

I missed that. Still a YTA moment for the attitude about the wedding and all of that. But at least OP didn't attend in uniform.

You were at a wedding I am sorry I am at a wedding is a perfectly reasonable response", "If we have judgements purely off of emotions then this sub would cease to exist because everyone would be an asshole. \n\nNot wanting to do something/be somewhere doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.", "Not when you have bills to pay! Glad you don't have to struggle.\n\n I want to know what kind of bull the bride gave to every man wearing a white shirt with their suit! What kind of crazy was she on?\n\n A freaking name tag and lanyard.....absolutely crazy that the bride got hurt feelings over....what a loser!", "I bet she was jealous of the clouds too", "Don\u2019t get me wrong I don\u2019t think a white lanard is awful but they shouldn\u2019t have work work uniform to  wedding.
