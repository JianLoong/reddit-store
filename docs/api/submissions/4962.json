Now, if that's ALL you were \"wearing\" it would be a different story. NTA", "Also men tend to wear white button downs as part of their formal wear.", "When I was a teenager I also went to social events I wasn't that enthusiastic about because family insisted that it was important. While this is good advice for OP to keep in mind for the future, they might not have full autonomy to refuse at the moment.", "I\u2019m not sure why you got downvoted. This is total fiction.", "It *doesn't* apply to suits. Every wedding I've been to (admittingly only about four) the men, including myself, wore white shirts under their black suit-jackets. Often with the wedding's accent color for the tie.", "See, it would be passed over for a sitcom as too stupid to get a laugh.  Just like the bride. NTA", "I guess with some brides we need to wear sunglasses the whole time because the whites of our eyes might upstage them.", "Thanks, I needed to clean my tablet anyway!", "\ud83c\udfc6", "Hilarious, thanks for the laugh", "\ud83e\udd23\n\nTHIS!\n\nNTA", "It feels like the bride's actual problem might not have been the white, but that the rest of the outfit was a (blue collar) work uniform. Getting mad over white accents is so outwardly ridiculous that there **has** to be something else going on.\n\nIf I had to guess as to the bride's *actual* problem, it would be that there *might* be someone in a mechanic's uniform in the background of *some* or their wedding pictures. \n\nIn principle, OP could have told the groom they were leaving *before* they changed into their work clothes and then left directly after changing. But unless the event was much, *much* fancier than OP is letting on (eg. White Tie) it's a harmless *faux pas* and not something to yell at anybody, much less a teenager, over.", "Me too! I only had a seal though...but it's yours!", "I have never felt more loved by reddit lol", "Maybe she's just in a bad mood because she knows that she shouldn't be wearing white either?", "What if their purse had white on it? Were they made to leave it in the car? Some women get crazy about weddings and go full bridezilla.", "And those do include dress whites!", "Plaid pants and vests were never the same again \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. Are these angry people insane?! How utterly ridiculous!", "Show up in a wedding dress on their anniversary. That way you can at least say you earned the ire.", "She just wanted to bitch. I asked all my guests to not wear thongs (flip-flops) or t-shirts. It was a semi-formal event and I was following the dress code for the venue. One of my husband's mates showed up in a t-shirt and flip-flops. I did say something to my husband and he just shrugged, and I let it go. What I said to my hubby was along the lines of \"ugh, why?\" My hubby shrugged in his way of saying it's fine, it'll be ok. So the rest of the night I focussed on my husband and remembering how to dance without tripping myself up on my dress.", "NTA\n\nI can see why you didn\u2019t want to be there. She\u2019s ridiculous. Demand an apology from her and go low contact until you get it.", "When people say \u201cno white\u201d it means shirts, trousers, skirts, or dresses\u2026 not fucking lanyards and name tags. Jfc NTA", "I wonder what would happen if it snowed or if a cumulus cloud passed by during the wedding.  Sheesh.", "That relationship won't be lasting too long\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 NTA", "Bridezillas these days be wanting a complete year of celebrations, a bridesmaid investment worth a mortgage and a complete monopoly on every colour on the spectrum", "NTA she is taking wearing white to the extreme.

NTA bride has some crazy insecurity lmfao", "NTA. She's being ridiculous. First of all, I'm pretty sure that rule means you can't wear something predominantly white, not that you can't wear anything with a single spot of white. I can't imagine anyone would interpret it that way. Second of all, you weren't wearing it \\*to\\* the wedding. You were wearing it to your \\*exit\\* from the wedding.", "NTA - I mean, a lanyard?  Is she serious?  And the family/friends who are taking her side because \u201cit\u2019s her wedding\u201d - I don\u2019t care if it was her funeral, she\u2019s being absurd.   Was someone possibly going to mistake OP and his patch and lanyard for the bride?  Did her dress consist of a lanyard and patch?  No?  The wtf is the problem?  \nThe number of people I read about who spoil their own \u201cspecial day\u201d by being more concerned about micromanaging it like it\u2019s a movie set and they\u2019re the overpaid big name producer is just insane.", "Nta. These are always so weird. After my wedding I hardly texted anyone for days, I was too happy and excited I only wanted to focus on my husband and honeymoon. I can\u2019t imagine sending mean / angry messages to anyone during that time! She sounds miserable.", "NTA. I think it is now clear why you didn\u2019t want to go to this wedding.", "nta. idk what you can do besides apologize, and move on, if you care to. they dont seem like they're worth it if theyre gonna throw up a stink over something like this", "What colour shirts were people wearing? Not one white one? \n\nNTA.", "NTA - the rule is really for people not to wear overly white dresses or suits. To make such a big deal over something so inconsequential that literally nobody would notice but the bride says volumes about her. I smell a divorce within 5 years.", "I hope this is a joke! What lunacy. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nWhite is supposed to symbolise purity and virginity so most brides shouldn't be wearing it either.", "Nta\nThe bride is a bit psycho for caring about a patch and a lanyard. Not wearing white to a wedding is about the OUTFIT and usually limited to women wearing white dresses, or anything that might be confused as wedding attire.", "NTA, but you're lucky that you didn't get the call before the ceremony or the groom might have married you instead of the bride.\n\nAlso, it sounds like the bride might be a little jealous of your uniform. Perhaps it was more stylish than her dress?", "The bride can GTFO with that \u201cwhite\u201d bullshit. A patch\u2019s mod a lanyard? Damn, that\u2019s just LOOKING for a fight. What a nut job", "NTA. Was she mad that the clouds are white? How about people's teeth? Oh no! Don't let her see the whites of your eyes! Girly pop needs to chill out.", "NTA. This is insane. Refuse to engage. Don\u2019t even lower yourself to discuss something so silly.", "NTA. If anyone mistook you for the bride because of the white in your uniform, they were likely at the wrong wedding.", "Not only that, it was maybe 1% of his attire. Literally an accent if anything. The bride is just being petty.", "So no one wore white shirts I guess?! So nta, bridezilla is though", "Take all my imaginary awards. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udf96\ufe0f\ud83e\udd47", "The bride needs to get over herself!!! You're really, really NTA. Does it clash that you're in work clothes for a minute- sure. Is it something to get worked up about? No."]}
