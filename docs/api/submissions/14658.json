We originally met over social media and roomed with each other due to shared interests, but her behavior during the year made me not want to live with her again.\n\nHere are some specifics. She often throws out my food, such as bananas with a little brown on the peel, without telling me. She does the same with my takeout containers if she thinks they've been in the fridge for too long (usually 24 hours after I get them). She occasionally also throws out my skin care or makeup products she thinks are \"contaminated.\" Between this and food, that's thousands of lost dollars. In the mornings/night, when she's turning lights on/off, she flicks the switch three or seven times. This is really frustrating when I'm already in bed/trying to sleep. Similarly, when she's leaving or entering, she wants to hear the door \"click\" (she opens it and lets it slam) in the doorframe three or seven times. Again, this is really disruptive when I'm sleeping or studying. She's also nervous about leaving things plugged in, so sometimes she'll unplug my extension cord, and I'll wake up in the morning with no charge on any of the devices I need for class. Same thing on the extension cord where our appliances are plugged in - she's accidentally unplugged our fridge and microwave on several occasions. She also rearranges the room a lot. Sometimes it's fairly benign like changing the positioning of the furniture so my bed ends up in a different spot but other times she's even gone into my closet and repositioned my clothes/hangers. This doesn't even cover everything - she also has a lot of specific habits around laundry, showering, etc. and if I don't follow them she gets upset. \n\nThroughout the year I've spoken to her about these things, but it hasn't really made a difference. It wasn't until last week that she mentioned having OCD, ADHD, and anxiety. She said that she wasn't medicated/in treatment for anything and wasn't planning on being.\n\nThis weekend we discussed housing. I told her that I thought she was a great person and would love to stay in touch, but that I wanted to look for someone new to live with as I thought we were incompatible for living together. This was honestly a decision I'd made long before she mentioned any of her mental disorders. She got really upset and asked me what exactly was the issue, and I said it was all the stuff I've tried talking to her about before (i.e. the stuff in the previous paragraph). She said that it wasn't fair that I was blaming her for having mental disorders and that she couldn't control her actions because of the OCD. She also said that I had to room with her or she would tell everyone that I was ableist. \n\nSo, AITA for not rooming with her again?", "created_utc": 1681347606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12k6cb5/aita_for_not_rooming_with_my_roommate_again/", "score": 1092, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She let me know up front, however, and I agreed to live together because my mom and two of my sisters also have OCD, and panic disorder, alongside with bipolar disorder. So I thought it wouldn't be anything I wasn't accustomed to. It wasn't until about halfway through our freshmen year, when she stopped treatment because she thought she didn't need it anymore, that similar things started happening (she would also wake me up 3-5 times a night to make sure I was still alive because she was convinced she did something wrong which would in turn lead to my death). I explained to her at the end of the year that unless she was getting treatment, living together wasn't tenable anymore. She understood and actually applied for a special circumstance with our college to be allowed to live alone. This not only worked well for me as I had found a new dorm room with some of my friends right down the hall from her, but also helped her a ton to have complete control over her environment (she ended up back in treatment by junior year as well thankfully). We would still have sleep overs at least once a week, but she understood that me not being able to live properly with her conditions did not make her conditions my responsibility or me abelist. After we stopped living together, our friendship actually got stronger.\n\nI hope your roommate can come to an understanding that although you sympathize with her OCD, her OCD is not your responsibility to manage or accept as a factor in your personal living conditions.

Again this is just from own personal experience...it was definitely a process to get accommodations in college.
