{"id": 14658, "submission_id": "12k6cb5", "title": "AITA for not rooming with my roommate again because she has OCD?", "selftext": "Throwaway because my roommate knows my reddit account. \n\nI (19f) decided not to live with my roommate (19f) again next year. We originally met over social media and roomed with each other due to shared interests, but her behavior during the year made me not want to live with her again.\n\nHere are some specifics. She often throws out my food, such as bananas with a little brown on the peel, without telling me. She does the same with my takeout containers if she thinks they've been in the fridge for too long (usually 24 hours after I get them). She occasionally also throws out my skin care or makeup products she thinks are \"contaminated.\" Between this and food, that's thousands of lost dollars. In the mornings/night, when she's turning lights on/off, she flicks the switch three or seven times. This is really frustrating when I'm already in bed/trying to sleep. Similarly, when she's leaving or entering, she wants to hear the door \"click\" (she opens it and lets it slam) in the doorframe three or seven times. Again, this is really disruptive when I'm sleeping or studying. She's also nervous about leaving things plugged in, so sometimes she'll unplug my extension cord, and I'll wake up in the morning with no charge on any of the devices I need for class. Same thing on the extension cord where our appliances are plugged in - she's accidentally unplugged our fridge and microwave on several occasions. She also rearranges the room a lot. Sometimes it's fairly benign like changing the positioning of the furniture so my bed ends up in a different spot but other times she's even gone into my closet and repositioned my clothes/hangers. This doesn't even cover everything - she also has a lot of specific habits around laundry, showering, etc. and if I don't follow them she gets upset. \n\nThroughout the year I've spoken to her about these things, but it hasn't really made a difference. It wasn't until last week that she mentioned having OCD, ADHD, and anxiety. She said that she wasn't medicated/in treatment for anything and wasn't planning on being.\n\nThis weekend we discussed housing. I told her that I thought she was a great person and would love to stay in touch, but that I wanted to look for someone new to live with as I thought we were incompatible for living together. This was honestly a decision I'd made long before she mentioned any of her mental disorders. She got really upset and asked me what exactly was the issue, and I said it was all the stuff I've tried talking to her about before (i.e. the stuff in the previous paragraph). She said that it wasn't fair that I was blaming her for having mental disorders and that she couldn't control her actions because of the OCD. She also said that I had to room with her or she would tell everyone that I was ableist. \n\nSo, AITA for not rooming with her again?", "created_utc": 1681347606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12k6cb5/aita_for_not_rooming_with_my_roommate_again/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Throwing out your not-trash food items and hygiene items without asking is a no go. That costs money to replace!  \n2. Rearranging your closet and personal spaces is also a no go.  \nIt's not a good living situation. It's okay to back out.\n\nUnfortunately, the fear of being given any kind of \"-ist\" label is hard to overcome (and it sucks you were threatened with that) . But her touching your stuff with no consequences is not a good pattern to just... allow.", "NTA. You\u2019re not compatible living partners, and that\u2019s all the reason you need.", "NTA.  She can't help having OCD but she is choosing to vomit it all over everyone else by refusing treatment and medication.  She had nobody to blame but herself.  You are not being ableist.", "NTA, if you're not compatible living together you can't force anything otherwise you'll just end up resenting each other. I would have said no AHs but her threatening to defame you is an AH move.", "NTA. Your well-being matters too! And OCD does not make people threaten and blackmail - that\u2019s all on her and it\u2019s horrible.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m disabled with ADHD & autism. Her disabilities do not force her to violate/destroy another person\u2019s possessions. You are right that you are incompatible living together & she is absolutely in the wrong for saying you are ableist. You are not. She, however, is trying to manipulate you.", "NTA.\n\nGood grief, this villain is blackmailing you!\n\nDo not room with her again under any circumstances. She'\\[s nuts, and she's using her alleged \"ailments\" to really go to town with them. \n\nAs for \"ableism,\" just wait till someone else is exposed to her shenanigans. The truth will out.", "NTA. People tend to seek treatment when their disorder(s) start negatively impacting their life and relationships. She may not be ready for that anytime soon, it's scary and very daunting. It sounds like you were direct but kind, and are doing the right thing for yourself. \n\nHer trying to coerce you into living with her again is not okay, that's AH territory. Probably a knee jerk panic reaction but still. Sounds like you don't owe her a damn thing.", "NTA and DO NOT let her blackmail you into being her roommate for another year. If she truly has these conditions then she needs to be working with a trained and competent medical team to address them. She can't expect you or anyone else for that matter to deal with her when she doesn't care enough to get the treatment she needs.", "NTA I would've made her pay for every single thing of mine that she threw away! Honestly I am not sure why you even stayed the year. She'd be my worst nightmare! Move out and don't look back....", "NTA-OCD probably makes it difficult for her in making home feel like home, but you probably will not feel at home if she is disrupting your home too. You and your mental health are just as important as hers.\n\nI hope you can remain friends. I have people in my life I may not be able to live with, but a great friends.", "NTA. I have ASD with ADHD and OCD features. I can be an absolute pain to deal with at times, but I have taken time to learn about my stuff and am up front with it about people I need to be. Even with people going in knowing, the downsides can be a lot to handle for me, and even harder for others, so when they need to step away or take a break, I get it. It sounds like you tried to talk to them and be mature about it, so again NTA. There's not much more if communication isn't working and the other party just wants to play victim. The threatening/blackmail is an absolute deal breaker. That alone would have me telling you to go do you and don't think twice about it.", "NTA. I hope you enjoy having a new roommate.", "NTA\n\nYou tried it for a year and it\u2019s not working out for you. \n\nShe is costing you money, time to replace items and not respecting your boundaries.\n\nYou\u2019ve been respectful to mention these things before and now you gave her a heads up you are going in another direction. Her response is to threaten you, try to force you to room with her, ugh nope! She clearly is just after what is best for herself.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. If you are in dorms report her ass. I would let your friends know what is going on and that she is trying to blackmail you.", "NTA You are not happy living with her, that is enough of a reason to not room with her again. She has OCD and refuses to get any help or treatment for it, which is her right. You don't have to put up with someone who makes you uncomfortable.\n\nI have ocd and it is my problem. No one has to carry that burden but me. I don't have the right to force other people to suffer because I have a mental health issue. She has no right to touch your property whether she has ocd or not. She doesn't respect you or your belongings. If she can't control herself enough to leave other people's things alone, then she should live alone.\n\nIt is not ableist at all. It is self-preservation. You deserve to have a home where your belongings aren't moved or thrown out, not be disturbed when trying to study or sleep, and not have things you need unplugged.\n\nI wouldn't live with a kleptomaniac either. Having a diagnosis doesn't mean others have to sacrifice their own quality of life for you.", "NTA. I used to live with someone who played similar tricks with plugs, it\u2019s really frustrating and builds resentment. I\u2019ve lost food from a freezer that was unplugged for \u201cSafety\u201d and I hated sitting down to watch TV only to find that it was off at the wall instead of being able to be turned on remotely. I\u2019m sure she is lovely but moving away from her is the right thing to do, especially if she\u2019s never going to medicate.", "NTA Mental illness or not, you don't need to put up with that kind of behavior. Any sympathy she may have garnered went away with the blackmail.", "NTA. Nevermind the complete disrespect for your boundaries and belongings. Her blackmailing you went way over the line. She isn't a friend and you should completely cut her off when you are able to get out of there.", "NTA. She doesn't get to call you ableist when she's doing nothing to mitigate her issues.\n\nLife isn't fair. That's a fact and there are generations of people who don't know this.\n\nYou need a different roommate. She's throwing your things away, preventing you from sleeping and getting into your closet among other things. \n\nMake other arrangements, don't feel bad and don't look back.", "NTA who cares about being called an \"ableist\". People come up with the stupidest. She is a terrible roommate and why would you stay another year with her. She needs to learn to control herself.", "op=NTA\n\n1) you get to choose to room with anyone you want(or not)  \n2) she's cost you 1000s of dollars   \n3) she's not even TRYING to deal with her issues which means they won't get better but will instead get worse  \n4) she has made your home life/sleep pretty miserable.    \n\n\nTell her to go ahead and tell whomever she wants, And anyone who comes to you.  *Say, fine, you spend a semester as her roommate and then come talk to me again.*", "She can't control that she has a disorder but she can control not treating it.

Therapy has made a huge positive impact on my quality of life as well as on my relationships with friends and family. Your roommate is going to have to come to terms with the fact that she is going to have to do something about her disorder because the status quo is untenable.
