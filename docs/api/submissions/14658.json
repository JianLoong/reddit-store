We originally met over social media and roomed with each other due to shared interests, but her behavior during the year made me not want to live with her again.\n\nHere are some specifics. She often throws out my food, such as bananas with a little brown on the peel, without telling me. She does the same with my takeout containers if she thinks they've been in the fridge for too long (usually 24 hours after I get them). She occasionally also throws out my skin care or makeup products she thinks are \"contaminated.\" Between this and food, that's thousands of lost dollars. In the mornings/night, when she's turning lights on/off, she flicks the switch three or seven times. This is really frustrating when I'm already in bed/trying to sleep. Similarly, when she's leaving or entering, she wants to hear the door \"click\" (she opens it and lets it slam) in the doorframe three or seven times. Again, this is really disruptive when I'm sleeping or studying. She's also nervous about leaving things plugged in, so sometimes she'll unplug my extension cord, and I'll wake up in the morning with no charge on any of the devices I need for class. Same thing on the extension cord where our appliances are plugged in - she's accidentally unplugged our fridge and microwave on several occasions. She also rearranges the room a lot. Sometimes it's fairly benign like changing the positioning of the furniture so my bed ends up in a different spot but other times she's even gone into my closet and repositioned my clothes/hangers. This doesn't even cover everything - she also has a lot of specific habits around laundry, showering, etc. and if I don't follow them she gets upset. \n\nThroughout the year I've spoken to her about these things, but it hasn't really made a difference. It wasn't until last week that she mentioned having OCD, ADHD, and anxiety. She said that she wasn't medicated/in treatment for anything and wasn't planning on being.\n\nThis weekend we discussed housing. I told her that I thought she was a great person and would love to stay in touch, but that I wanted to look for someone new to live with as I thought we were incompatible for living together. This was honestly a decision I'd made long before she mentioned any of her mental disorders. She got really upset and asked me what exactly was the issue, and I said it was all the stuff I've tried talking to her about before (i.e. the stuff in the previous paragraph). She said that it wasn't fair that I was blaming her for having mental disorders and that she couldn't control her actions because of the OCD. She also said that I had to room with her or she would tell everyone that I was ableist. \n\nSo, AITA for not rooming with her again?", "created_utc": 1681347606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12k6cb5/aita_for_not_rooming_with_my_roommate_again/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you tried to talk to them and be mature about it, so again NTA. There's not much more if communication isn't working and the other party just wants to play victim.

No one has to carry that burden but me. I don't have the right to force other people to suffer because I have a mental health issue. She has no right to touch your property whether she has ocd or not. She doesn't respect you or your belongings. If she can't control herself enough to leave other people's things alone, then she should live alone.\n\nIt is not ableist at all. It is self-preservation. You deserve to have a home where your belongings aren't moved or thrown out, not be disturbed when trying to study or sleep, and not have things you need unplugged.\n\nI wouldn't live with a kleptomaniac either.

You're not even obligated to live with someone who's currently getting help, if it's bugging you that much.

Get out of there. You have been tolerant to an extreme, see how far she'd get with a new roommate. \n\nNTA", "Or op can let roommate have someone sleepover with her.. Then they will see!", "This was my first thought. If it's really this bad and she really can't do anything to fight it, she needs an inpatient program asap. She shouldn't be living with anyone, she should be off getting the help she needs. \n\nAnd it absolutely eats away at me with guilt when my mental illness even mildly inconveniences my friends.
