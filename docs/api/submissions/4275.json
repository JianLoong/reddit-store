I'm confused as to why they thought it was okay to ask to borrow your party games in the first place when they didn't invite you. You're all mutual friends and share a group chat, and the fact that the party wasn't mentioned there at all clearly shows that they're excluding you. Which would be okay of course (friend groups don't need to invite everyone all the time for gatherings), *if* they didn't ask the guy they clearly excluded for *his* party games. You had the right to tell them no (though you could have handled it better), and if they really want to play party games, they can go out and buy their own instead of asking for yours when you're not even invited.", "Info - could it possibly be a family party and not a friends party? I could see not wanting to mix the two.", "NTA - it was kind of an AH move on their parts though to ask about borrowing games for a party they admitted they were throwing with their friends and not inviting you.  It would be one thing if they had a good reason and made that clear - i.e. they were invited to a party of people you don't know, or with family, or a work party - but you still wouldn't be an AH for deciding not to lend the games. But based on your description of how it went, I would've been hurt too and wouldn't have wanted to lend the games either.", "NAH, (and I'd even say N T A given the details would fit)\n\nI mean they really needed more of a reason. Maybe you were quick to dismiss before getting more info but I don't think \"my games only come if I do\" stance isn't the worst thing out there.  Maybe next time  you \"could\" be nicer if this was the first time this came up.. But I think you need to establish this with the greater friend group \"I know I got good stuff, but I also like to partake and keep track of my stuff, so I'm not loaning it out\".  \n\n\nSo... eh they could have been more forthcoming on \"why\" they didn't invite you to a group you know, but still want your stuff. You could have been nicer.

They ask me for stuff to borrow, and I let them borrow them within reason. Idk what kind of game of cat and mouse yall play when it comes to communication, but something doesn't sit right with your post unless you're a bunch of high schoolers. What it sounds like here is a bunch of passive aggression, When you could've just asked why, wasn't I invited?\n\nI'll also add that if you're so concerned with the why of this situation, how good of friends are you really with these people? To me, it seems like you have an ex or a \"friend\" who was invited, and now your friends are keeping you in the dark. It's clear that you weren't invited for a specific reason. You seem young, possibly in college, so I would dig a little deeper than a petty hangup. You deserve a little more respect than what you've been given.\n\nAll of that being said, it's OK for a friend to ask you for apples to apples. You don't have to say yes. They don't have to tell you why. But a true friend will be way more forthcoming off the jump. Example: \"Hey, can I borrow a couple of board games, I'm having a work party or a high school reunion thing at my place. I'd invite you, but you won't know anyone.\" Would you accept that if that was the case? Or is it more of an issue of  \"if you're borrowing something of mine, then I better be invited\" type situation?

So three of us girls went there and told them off again. \n\nI can\u2019t remember if it was before or after that when they threw her in the dumpster and I got her out. All of the other kids at my school were pretty nice except the bullies (them)", "No GURLZ LOUD", "_\"I know **their** friends.\"_\n\nI read the post just fine; I just have a different point of view. I also know the friends of my friends - as per my original comment. That doesn't make them **my** friends, nor do I think it's weird to have separate friend groups. And, no, the spending money to buy pizza analogy is not the same as borrowing a board game that will be returned. The shared chat comment was also an edit that was added later on.\n\nI have allowed my good friends to borrow my personal possessions for showers, parties etc that I am not invited to since it is not a social circle that I am close with. This has not offended me. But, as per my original comment, I note that this is still not an obligation for OP.", "Nah that\u2019s some wicked shit to do to a friend NTA especially since you know everyone already and they purposely left you out seeing you all have a group chat", "NTA\n\nLet them play games of their own. Leave your \"toys\" alone.", "NTA they should buy their own games or borrow from the people coming to the party.", "NTA \n\nThey should start reading Miss Manners.", "NTA. At all. And I know it\u2019s not going to ruin your life - you sound like a balanced, positive, fun person - but they really did a hurtful thing. You deserve better friends.", "NTA - You're not a lending library. If they're not going to invite you with the rest of your friend group, inviting your games alone is pretty rude. I'd feel differently if they wanted them for a family holiday thing with the nieces and nephews or something, but this isn't that.", "I\u2019m just comfortable in my friendships.  I\u2019m an introvert, and I don\u2019t consider many people good friends, but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to borrow something from anyone in that group.  And I don\u2019t get sad when I see pictures on social media of them doing something with other people.  I also lend things regularly to them.  I spent an afternoon helping my closest friend make a complicated dessert for a dinner party I,was not invited to - we had a lovely time then, and it made me happy that her guests that night loved the dessert.\n\nI\u2019ll just assume this all different for the extroverts of the world.", "YTA, and immature. Your friend is allowed to have other friends unrelated to your friend group. Either a yes or no would have been enough.  I would lend my best friend games for a party no pro lem. Why? Because she's my best friend. Your friend is not cheating on you, they just have other friends like normal folk do. \n\nJust because you are casual acquainted does make you their friend.\n\nYta mainly for being a kbhead.", "why are y\u2019all downvoting me? my reply was before i had the extra details that he knows the friends and i wasn\u2019t the only one with this take lmao", "Surprise parties are good when they happen randomly. It basically lets you know people feel and care about you when you aren\u2019t there. They\u2019re absolutely terrible when they\u2019re for a planned celebration though."]}
