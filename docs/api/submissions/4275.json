They can go buy their own games.", "INFO are you friends with their friends?", "NTA \n\nNot an AH for having a party without you. Most people don't invite *all* their friends to all their parties. But it was inconsiderate to ask to borrow your games for it. Why not ask the invitees to bring games? For that, they're the AH.\n\n(But you over-reacted a little)", "I agree that the giddy request was rude and immature.  Sounds like they had already been partying.  Next request would have been for you to deliver snacks.  NTA;  your response was nice and succinct.", "Wow, seriously. NTA.", "I could see some situations where it makes sense. Like a couples night. Or a swingers event. Different friends groups who do different drugs or gamble", "NTA overall in this situation, but I do think that the way you handled it was immature. I'm confused as to why they thought it was okay to ask to borrow your party games in the first place when they didn't invite you. You're all mutual friends and share a group chat, and the fact that the party wasn't mentioned there at all clearly shows that they're excluding you. Which would be okay of course (friend groups don't need to invite everyone all the time for gatherings), *if* they didn't ask the guy they clearly excluded for *his* party games. You had the right to tell them no (though you could have handled it better), and if they really want to play party games, they can go out and buy their own instead of asking for yours when you're not even invited.", "Info - could it possibly be a family party and not a friends party? I could see not wanting to mix the two.", "NTA - it was kind of an AH move on their parts though to ask about borrowing games for a party they admitted they were throwing with their friends and not inviting you.  It would be one thing if they had a good reason and made that clear - i.e. they were invited to a party of people you don't know, or with family, or a work party - but you still wouldn't be an AH for deciding not to lend the games. But based on your description of how it went, I would've been hurt too and wouldn't have wanted to lend the games either.", "NAH, (and I'd even say N T A given the details would fit)\n\nI mean they really needed more of a reason. Maybe you were quick to dismiss before getting more info but I don't think \"my games only come if I do\" stance isn't the worst thing out there.  Maybe next time  you \"could\" be nicer if this was the first time this came up.. But I think you need to establish this with the greater friend group \"I know I got good stuff, but I also like to partake and keep track of my stuff, so I'm not loaning it out\".  \n\n\nSo... eh they could have been more forthcoming on \"why\" they didn't invite you to a group you know, but still want your stuff. You could have been nicer. But I don't think either quite makes it to AH level if this was the first time this came up, just communicate clearer and establish this boundary going forward to the greater friend group and it should all work out.", "NAH.\n\nYou don't have to loan anything if you don't want, and you don't have to have a reason.\n\nBut they aren't an AH for asking to borrow the games, or for not inviting you.  It doesn't sound like you bothered to hear the details.  It might have been a crowd they didn't think you fit into.  People are allowed to have more than one set of friends.", "YTA. I understand being a little upset but people have multiple friend groups/types of friends and sometimes people don\u2019t like to mix them. They just wanted to borrow them for a night", "YTA. People can have different friend groups. I don\u2019t mix my normal friends with work friends. Get the fuck over yourself.", "YTA. So what if your friend wanted to borrow games for a party you're not invited to? Your friend is allowed to have different friend groups. My friends have other friends from work, high school, college etc. that I don't know or hang out with. Similarly I have friends they do not know or hang out with. If my friend wanted to borrow something from me for a party with their other friends I won't have to think twice about lending nor would I care if I wasn't invited to said party. You know why? Cuz I'm not part of that friend group and I don't have fomo. Grow up. Smh.", "ESH could be NTA but your response was just as immature as them asking for shit without inviting you. All in all be more mindful on how you communicate, could've made them feel bad & taught them a lesson without making yourself look bad to them. Now after you hung up they probably were thinking \"that's exactly why you weren't invited\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Certainly this person isn't a friend at all\n\nTo make that call was cruel\n\nNTA", "You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to provide them with games, but the manner in which you answered makes YTA. \n\nI\u2019m never a fan of speaking down to people you call your friends. For all you know, the \u201cfriends\u201d they were having over were from a club, work, or a different group in which you\u2019re not a part of. \n\nI\u2019ve had get togethers with certain groups of my friends where I wouldn\u2019t invite certain friends from other groups. Some people care about dynamics. Maybe you didn\u2019t fit the dynamic? Not everything is done by others as a way to insult you. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. \n\nYou don\u2019t know the situation and you certainly shouldn\u2019t speak to people you care about in such a negative way. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they distance themselves from you after this little spout.\n\nEdit - I saw your edit. Definitely changes the situation considering you\u2019re friends with the entire group. Makes it a little odd, then. However, I still stand by my initial ruling. That\u2019s not a way to talk about people you care about. You also don\u2019t know the entirety of the circumstances. Is it a couples night? Etc. I would\u2019ve communicated how you felt.", "You k let them but do you consider them your friends?", "Exactly right!", "Thank you. It really is simple logic.", "Yes, we\u2019ve hung out and even have a group chat together.

That\u2019s my issue", "I disagree - it's really rude to ask someone to borrow something and not invite them to the party OR - at the very least - to not explain WHY they aren't invited.  If they explained  - like \"Hey, my brother invited me to this work party of his and I was thinking they may love that game we played the other day, could I borrow it?\" But not \"We're throwing a party with a bunch of friends, can we borrow your games?\"", "I mean that\u2019s a fair point.

I would not want these kind of people to borrow my games. I rather not do that at all let alone without me being there. A lot of people are not really considerate with other people\u2019s stuff at parties. \n\nAnd it is just an AH move to want your games but not you\u2026 time for some new friends maybe?", "Yeah they\u2019ve got another chat", "Have you ever considered maybe it\u2019s not the same friend group?", "It's silly to think you know ALL their friends. It could be a coworker party. A party for people working on a group project. Family party. Any number of things. And you didn't even bother to hear what they had to say.", "You know them. Great. That still doesn\u2019t make you right.", "I would agree with you if OP had not hung up on the borrower before giving them a chance to explain or even invite him.", "Well if they are having a party with your mutual friends, not inviting you and still asking to borrow your games, then they are indeed AH.  And clueless AH at that.\n\nAre they generally this clueless?\n\nOr is it possible that you hung up mad before understanding what was going on?", "I like your optimism on the first one, haha.", "Not all their friends. They told me who was gonna be at the party. Party may have been a strong word. It\u2019s maybe five people. But they\u2019re all five on the group chat I had talked about.", "It's even sillier to think that you know better than OP if they know the friend group or not lmao. I will never tire of the arrogance of commenters like you.", "Yeah it does. OP's friends are allowed to hold parties and not invite OP. OP is allowed to not lend games for a party they're not invited to", "Fair, but maybe they should've lead with that.  Also, why would they need to \"Borrow\" the games, if he was going to be invited.  They should've said - we're throwing a party, can you bring the games?  Borrow implies he won't be coming.", "Thank you I was hopeful for you.", "And it just makes them a petty AH.", "I already replied to OP with this: \n\n>Well if they are having a party with your mutual friends, not inviting you and still asking to borrow your games, then they are indeed AH. And clueless AH at that.\n\nBut we may never know, because OP hung up on them.  Which was childish but not AH behavior under the circumstances.", "How is it petty? You've shown that you don't want me there. Pretty fucking rude of you to say \"I don't want you but I want your stuff\"", "I'm going NAH. Even my best friends have parties without me. They ask me for stuff to borrow, and I let them borrow them within reason. Idk what kind of game of cat and mouse yall play when it comes to communication, but something doesn't sit right with your post unless you're a bunch of high schoolers. What it sounds like here is a bunch of passive aggression, When you could've just asked why, wasn't I invited?\n\nI'll also add that if you're so concerned with the why of this situation, how good of friends are you really with these people? To me, it seems like you have an ex or a \"friend\" who was invited, and now your friends are keeping you in the dark. It's clear that you weren't invited for a specific reason. You seem young, possibly in college, so I would dig a little deeper than a petty hangup. You deserve a little more respect than what you've been given.\n\nAll of that being said, it's OK for a friend to ask you for apples to apples. You don't have to say yes. They don't have to tell you why. But a true friend will be way more forthcoming off the jump. Example: \"Hey, can I borrow a couple of board games, I'm having a work party or a high school reunion thing at my place. I'd invite you, but you won't know anyone.\" Would you accept that if that was the case? Or is it more of an issue of  \"if you're borrowing something of mine, then I better be invited\" type situation? Either way, it doesn't change my judgment, but I think there's more to this outside of not getting an invite.", "That's some kind of major mean girl sh$t!", "NTA \n\nI do not borrow my games to anyone unless I'm included or I know none of the people attending are assholes who will wreck my games. Yeah, I'm an over-bearing asshole who hates their cards being held while bended but you can buy and bend your own effing cards if you can't hold them properly", "Is it at all possible they were planning a surprise party and wanted you to bring the games to get you there? \n\n\nNTA in general though", "NTA I had a friend send me a video last NYE from a party he was at that I wasn't invited to reminiscing about  a party I was invited to that happened years ago. I don't talk to him anymore.", "NTA. You should realize that they don't see you as close of a friend as you see them.

That\u2019s where they missed up. There is nothing wrong, however, with having a party where you\u2019re not invited because people can have different circles of friends. \n\nSome people don\u2019t get they\u2019re lacking in manners. *They need to be told straight up.* So I would\u2019ve told them how rude it is to borrow a game for a party I\u2019m not invited to and say no, you\u2019re not borrowing my games and hang up.", "NTA", "NTA- you sure this is your Best Friend?", "I\u2019m not sure I want the swingers using my board games either.", "Uh.... who the hell would want to lend their toys for a friend's swinger event?\n\nYech!", ">People can have different friend groups.\n\nI think that's exactly what OP was thinking when they first agreed. Turns out that wasn't the case so the party giver can get the fuck over themselves and do without OP's board games.", "I\u2019ve borrowed things from a friend for a social thing they aren\u2019t invited to - but it\u2019s always accompanied by an explanation.  Like \u201cHey, we invited Mark and Sue to dinner to get to know them; could we borrow x?\u201d  I would loan under the same circumstances, without thinking it weird.  But that tends to be a small group socializing, and I\u2019ve had plenty of meals with the friends I would make that ask of.  We all do have other friends.\n\nI would find it strange for a larger party.  I\u2019m an introvert, so 9-1 I\u2019d decline (parties are my biggest nightmare), but I\u2019d find it rude not to get an invite at all.", "Well, 5 is into the area I would find acceptable.  It\u2019s nice to do something like a dinner and game in smaller numbers to get to know people better.", "OP can be as petty as they want, this is not \"r/AmIthePettyone?\". Not borrowing your stuff to someone is not AH move\n\nIt's AH move to borrow games from someone and not invite them for no apparent reason"]}
