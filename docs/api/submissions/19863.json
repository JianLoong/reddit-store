My in-laws live a few hours away and come into town every month or two. They will be in town next week for a few days to attend a wedding. About a month ago, we made plans for them to visit us and the kids on Sunday when they're here before they have to drive back in the evening. \n\nYesterday, they asked if they can also visit for a few hours on Friday as well. However, on Friday, my husband is working from 2:30pm to 1am so we had planned for our older daughter go to my mom's for the day. My daughter can be a handful (what 2.5 year old isn't!) so my mom helps out by taking her one or two days a week so I can focus on the 2 month old. My husband suggested my in-laws come Friday morning during breakfast time and while we're getting my daughter ready to go to my mom's. I told him I would prefer not because I'm tired from taking care of the 2 month old and breastfeeding and don't want to be \"on\" in the morning. Most mornings I'm exhausted, my hair is a mess, I have spit up on me, and my boobs are hanging out as I'm breastfeeding. I told him it'll also be nice to be able to have a bit of a rest and some \"me\" time for me to eat and shower in peace after I drop my daughter off and before my husband has to go to leave for work at 1:15pm. \n\nMy husband said it's really harsh that his parents only see the kids once a month and that I'm not letting them see the kids when they're here. I said his parents will see them on Sunday anyways. Friday is difficult with the schedule and I don't want to give up my morning or my rest time. He said he would do it and push through if the situation was reversed. It's true, he's a really hands-on and capable dad and really values family time. He more than pulls his weight when it comes to looking after the kids when he's not working. But him saying that made me feel selfish and inadequate as a mother because I'm unable to \"power through\" for his parents' visit. If Friday was the only time they're able to see us, then sure, I'll try to power through. But since they're spending the majority of the day with us on Sunday anyways, am I asking a lot to not want them here Friday morning as well?", "created_utc": 1686950180, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14b8cfq/aita_for_not_letting_my_inlaws_see_the_kids_when/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, they come every month or two so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re moving to another country/live in another country. Since he said you should be the one to power through, why not have him and your in-laws take your daughter out to somewhere and then have them drop her off at your mom\u2019s.

I've never seen anyone casually do the breastfeeding thing. It takes time and effort and has its toll. Being busy raising 2 young ones and being busy. Come on. Babe's, you absolutely NEED that rest, source, you said it.

Would it be a possible compromise for you to *not* have to be \"on\" that morning? I mean really sleep in.

You could pump and just use that morning to veg out in your room.", "NTA and also, seeing the kids once per month is actually quite frequent! Especially considering how far they live!", "NTA You are letting his parents see the kids on Sunday like you previously planned.  If he wants his parents to have more time with the kids then his parents can put effort into planning more time around your needs or he can take time when he's not working and do something to make that happen.  What's stopping him from taking a day off to \"power through\" his parents wants?  With a 2-month-old you're probably getting a limited amount of rest and because of that, you can't compromise on taking a healthy break when you have an opportunity to take one because that just isn't good for you.  Your husband needs to understand that his parents may want to see the kids but that doesn't mean they are entitled to push you to your limits to do so.", "Nta.  Of course, it's easier for him.", "NTA. If he can handle the breastfeeding all this week without any help from you (or contributions thereto), then he can do it for his folks while you sleep in. \nThey will see the kids two days later, it isn't really depriving them of some special event. You deserve a rest.", "NTA. If they want to see the kids more they can make plans to come see the kids. Not bc they are in the area for another event.", "NTA. Only once a month?? That\u2019s a hell of a lot more than some people get (Sorry I know that\u2019s not the point but I\u2019m feeling very sad about my geographical distance to some kids rn)", "NTA and the nerve of your husband to say \u201cif the roles were reversed\u201d\u2026as if he can breastfeed a baby fulltime while watching both a baby and a toddler AND entertain family. That\u2019s an unfair comparison smh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

They probably have only seen the 2 month out a couple times where as her mom see the kids 1 or2 times a week. Hubby may have used a poor choice of words but his right to be upset she is so unwelcoming to his parents. It\u2019s not like he loves her to take care of everything. She is just mad she may miss this week of me time."]}
