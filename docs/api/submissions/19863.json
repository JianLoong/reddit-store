My in-laws live a few hours away and come into town every month or two. They will be in town next week for a few days to attend a wedding. About a month ago, we made plans for them to visit us and the kids on Sunday when they're here before they have to drive back in the evening. \n\nYesterday, they asked if they can also visit for a few hours on Friday as well. However, on Friday, my husband is working from 2:30pm to 1am so we had planned for our older daughter go to my mom's for the day. My daughter can be a handful (what 2.5 year old isn't!) so my mom helps out by taking her one or two days a week so I can focus on the 2 month old. My husband suggested my in-laws come Friday morning during breakfast time and while we're getting my daughter ready to go to my mom's. I told him I would prefer not because I'm tired from taking care of the 2 month old and breastfeeding and don't want to be \"on\" in the morning. Most mornings I'm exhausted, my hair is a mess, I have spit up on me, and my boobs are hanging out as I'm breastfeeding. I told him it'll also be nice to be able to have a bit of a rest and some \"me\" time for me to eat and shower in peace after I drop my daughter off and before my husband has to go to leave for work at 1:15pm. \n\nMy husband said it's really harsh that his parents only see the kids once a month and that I'm not letting them see the kids when they're here. I said his parents will see them on Sunday anyways. Friday is difficult with the schedule and I don't want to give up my morning or my rest time. He said he would do it and push through if the situation was reversed. It's true, he's a really hands-on and capable dad and really values family time. He more than pulls his weight when it comes to looking after the kids when he's not working. But him saying that made me feel selfish and inadequate as a mother because I'm unable to \"power through\" for his parents' visit. If Friday was the only time they're able to see us, then sure, I'll try to power through. But since they're spending the majority of the day with us on Sunday anyways, am I asking a lot to not want them here Friday morning as well?", "created_utc": 1686950180, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14b8cfq/aita_for_not_letting_my_inlaws_see_the_kids_when/", "score": 225, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He does the bath time and bedtime for the toddler and I do it for our newborn. He does shift work 4 days a week so when he's working his long shifts (such as the 2:30pm-1am on Friday), I do all the meals, all the play times, all the bathtime and bedtime for both kids.

The \"me\" time I'm referring to when my mom has the toddler are the short moments when I can actually eat and take a shower in peace. I can not do that with two kids demanding my attention. I have not slept longer than a four hour stretch since our baby as been born.  \nAlso, I would love for his parents to see our kids more (and to be able to help more) but they live out of town.

Your husband has two options invite his parents and him hosting alone or don\u2019t do it at all.", "NAH. I get where both of you are coming from, you just have different priorities - neither one is wrong. Personally I\u2019d just get my in laws to watch my daughter for a few hours so they get to see her and I get my break.", "I was going to say the same thing.       \nUntil he has breastfed a baby he has no idea if he could \u2018push through\u2019", "I agree YTA. It also sounds like the husband helps out a lot. Is it too much to ask if his parents can see the kids an extra day for a few hours? He even said he would help  that morning with the kids while the parents were around and they would leave when he leaves for work and 2 yr old leaves for other grandparents house. She actually sounds like she gets a lot of \u201cme\u201d time, with all the help she gets from her husband and mom. Shes in a very privileged situation. Not a lot of moms get as much help as she does. She\u2019s being selfish because she\u2019s made this all about her. It\u2019s not only about her \u201cme\u201d time but she feels inadequate, because of the power through comment. But no one called  her that. She\u2019s letting her own insecurities dictate the situation", "She\u2019s getting a break when her kid leaves to go to grandma\u2019s, which is a regular thing. And it\u2019s not like this is a regular thing, it\u2019s one time, and it\u2019s only a few hours. I would understand if the husband wasn\u2019t helping, or if his parents were staying past the time he goes to work, or want to come by while he\u2019s at work. But he\u2019s just asking for a few hours so his parents can see the kids a bit more. Her reasons for saying no are about her own insecurities. And what  her in-laws will think of her.", "She herself  said her husband does most of the work. He lets her sleep in most mornings and takes care of their oldest, before going to work himself. And she even has her mom take the 2 yr old often. I bet she even pumps so that he can feed the 2 month old while she gets \u201cme\u201d she\u2019s totally being selfish, especially because her as she said does more than his share of the work", "You aren\u2019t the only mom who has young kids and feels overwhelmed at times.  But you\u2019re lucky in that you have support. A lot of moms aren\u2019t that lucky. It\u2019s also interesting that you mentioned wanting your in-law to visit more, but you also added wanting them helping out more. Your reasons for not wanting them over an extra day are selfish though.", "It's one visit, a couple of hours. If you can't do that for your husband, then yes YTA. \n\nI used to breastfeed my children every 2 hours so I know how it is. And I had a useless husband who was nothing like yours. So no excuses."]}
