It\u2019s gotten to the point where I have to check my cameras at work to make sure she doesn\u2019t move her sister in while I\u2019m at work.\n\nMy wife has a sister, Jill, who has a storybook memory. She regularly recounts events in her life that is heavily exaggerated or straight up never happened. \n\nFor example, she tells people she has a business degree and gives financial advice when in fact she only has an associate degree and has never worked in financing. She also brags about playing basketball in high school and her team going to state but losing to the rich school. Spoiler alert, she didn\u2019t play basketball in high school and doesn\u2019t have the coordination to dribble a ball and walk, much less run and shoot it.\n\nShe also tells tales of being mistreated by her parents which I doubt based on my personal involvement. For example, we celebrated Christmas with my in-laws and she posted on her social media about how her mother yelled at her in front of people and told her to eat less to be less fat. I was in the same house with her for a week and never noticed anything like that. The only time I witnessed a confrontation between her and my MIL was when my MIL told her to flush the toilet after each use. She recently made accusations against her employer for being mistreated on her social media instead of going to HR. Someone told on her and the company did an investigation which included recordings which disproved her story. I don\u2019t know the details but I know she was let go. Now that she\u2019s jobless, she can\u2019t pay her rent.\n\nJill brings drama whenever she goes with her tales of being mistreated. I work hard and home is my sanctuary. I don\u2019t want her to bring any drama to my sanctuary which brings us to the present. My wife argues that her sister has no where else to go and I pointed out she has several other siblings and parents who refused to take her in. I understand and love that my wife is a compassionate person but she can\u2019t save the world and I have to draw the line somewhere. \n\nI feel bad that my wife cries over this but not bad enough to allow the emotional tornado that is her sister live with us.

What does your wife think is going to happen if you take her in? Will it be any different than with the rest of the family? There's a reason they won't take her into their homes, so why on earth would your wife want to find out for herself why that is? She ought to be drawing on the lessons the rest of the family has already learned.\n\nNTA. No good deed goes unpunished, don't let yourself become the next target on SIL's hit list.", "NTA No No No.\n\nGod knows what you make up about you.   \n\nYou could hitting on her, or having an affair or any number of bad things.", "Nta, not wanting to take someone in that does false accusations is 100% reasonable. \n\nAsk your wife if she is comfortable taking her sister in who may accuse you of something if you upset her? What that could do to your life and reputation", "NTA- she sounds terrifying. The less interaction you have with her the better so thank goodness you are putting your foot down with her moving in.", "NTA I would refuse too. what kind of stories would she post about you?\n\nThat you mistreat her, or starve her? r maybe that you are into her?\n\nDon't bring chaos and drama to your house. \n\nTalk to your wife. It would be a hill i would be wiling to die on.", "NTA. This woman would be a train wreck and would destroy your home rather than be a gracious houseguest. If your wife wants to help her sister, maybe your wife can help in some other way. For example, helping pay one month's rent for an apartment or something.", "NTA ask your wife if housing her sister is worth a divorce. Because CASH MONEY, next thing you'll see on Facebook is \"BIL hit on me, what do I do!\" \"BIL was with another woman, men aren't loyal.\" \"My sister mistreated me the other night but I can't say anything or they'll kick me out.\"\nThe damage to your life, reputation and anything else is on you... if you let her live with you.", "NTA, and do not let Jill in, even if you have to give your wife an ultimatum.

Time for her to let go of her sister and for sister to face reality.", "NTA. She sounds absolutely exhausting. I understand your wife's concern but it's too much of a burden to be placed on you (and her!).", "Hah!  (I mean, it gets much worse.)", ">  *She's a pathological liar who focuses her lies on alleging mistreatment by others. It's only a matter of time before she turns on you and your wife as well--let it be over not letting her move in rather than some made-up issue*.\n\nThis explains the whole problem in a nutshell.  OP's SIL could, and probably would, make up accusations that would wreck his life, and could probably involve law enforcement.  \n\nOr, if he has children she might make up things that would get them removed from their home - until the charges were proven false.  \n\nShe likely knows that he doesn't want her living there, so she might target him to remove him from his own home.\n\nProtect yourself, OP.  Don't ever let yourself be alone with this person.  If wife brings her in you need to get a hotel room, and then see an attorney ASAP to find out exactly what your rights are in your state.  \n\nNTA", "Agreed. How long before she makes up a story about you- that results in problems between you & your wife? Within a week.", "Exactly! My guess is it will be less than 1 month before she says OP is trying to get her to have sex with him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason no other family has taken her in. Stand firm, I\u2019m sorry this is causing conflict with your wife.", "I wouldn\u2019t let her in, what if she begins telling lies, SERIOUS lies about you when you\u2019re working from home and nobody else is there to say she\u2019s lying?

She'll figure it out.", "NTA and once she moves in, she won't ever leave. And since you're the one standing in her way, she's absolutely gonna talk shit about you to your wife.", "Nta. If your wife brings her sister in, you leave. Tell your wife you won't be back until the sister is gone and that if she picks sister over you and your marriage then divorce is next. \n\nUsually I would suggest talking and compromising and counselling or other things before divorce but you have all the rights in the world to not want to live with someone who's hell bent on lying and making up stuff about other people, situations and being a complete trouble maker.", "At the rate she is going she is going to accuse you of something also\u2026 NTA.. this is a hill to die on", "Sometimes family members just suck, she seems to be one of them.

Don't let this happen, or if it does - then you *leave*.", "NTA.

She's a proven liar and manipulator. She WILL try to tell an untrue story about you, your home etc. to get attention or even to cause you real damage! \n\nIf your wife is so desperate to help her, she could pay for therapy for her sister which is all she should offer!", "NTA.  Best case scenario is that she tells your wife lies that your wife does not believe.  Worst case is she tells the police lies about how you assaulted her that they do believe, at least enough to arrest you and ruin your reputation, even if ultimately you are found not guilty.  Explain this to your wife, who may be so worried about her sister that she is not understanding this very real possibility.", "Well, that's a right but tough call. \nWeird that even a mother wouldn't take her in, why is it your wife's responsibility? Not blaming the mother in law though.\nYour wife should understand that above mentioned is not normal behaviour and you housing her would be straight up enabling instead of having SIL face the consequences of her actions and hopefully become a better adult. Your wife xan consider financing her therapy for fixing that pathological lier trait.", "As someone who has dealt with a relative like this, I understand she's your wife's sister, but do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT give this woman ANY kind of assistance, PERIOD! These are the kind of people, who, if given an inch will try to take the whole planet...just don't!", "Moving people in is always a two yes, one no situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This woman is a compulsive liar. Jill will tell lies about your sister and household.

If it\u2019s yellow, let it mellow. Maybe she was just conserving water..", "This was my first thought.
