It\u2019s gotten to the point where I have to check my cameras at work to make sure she doesn\u2019t move her sister in while I\u2019m at work.\n\nMy wife has a sister, Jill, who has a storybook memory. She regularly recounts events in her life that is heavily exaggerated or straight up never happened. \n\nFor example, she tells people she has a business degree and gives financial advice when in fact she only has an associate degree and has never worked in financing. She also brags about playing basketball in high school and her team going to state but losing to the rich school. Spoiler alert, she didn\u2019t play basketball in high school and doesn\u2019t have the coordination to dribble a ball and walk, much less run and shoot it.\n\nShe also tells tales of being mistreated by her parents which I doubt based on my personal involvement. For example, we celebrated Christmas with my in-laws and she posted on her social media about how her mother yelled at her in front of people and told her to eat less to be less fat. I was in the same house with her for a week and never noticed anything like that. The only time I witnessed a confrontation between her and my MIL was when my MIL told her to flush the toilet after each use. She recently made accusations against her employer for being mistreated on her social media instead of going to HR. Someone told on her and the company did an investigation which included recordings which disproved her story. I don\u2019t know the details but I know she was let go. Now that she\u2019s jobless, she can\u2019t pay her rent.\n\nJill brings drama whenever she goes with her tales of being mistreated. I work hard and home is my sanctuary. I don\u2019t want her to bring any drama to my sanctuary which brings us to the present. My wife argues that her sister has no where else to go and I pointed out she has several other siblings and parents who refused to take her in. I understand and love that my wife is a compassionate person but she can\u2019t save the world and I have to draw the line somewhere. \n\nI feel bad that my wife cries over this but not bad enough to allow the emotional tornado that is her sister live with us.

What does your wife think is going to happen if you take her in? Will it be any different than with the rest of the family? There's a reason they won't take her into their homes, so why on earth would your wife want to find out for herself why that is? She ought to be drawing on the lessons the rest of the family has already learned.\n\nNTA.

What that could do to your life and reputation", "NTA- she sounds terrifying. The less interaction you have with her the better so thank goodness you are putting your foot down with her moving in.", "NTA I would refuse too. what kind of stories would she post about you?\n\nThat you mistreat her, or starve her? r maybe that you are into her?\n\nDon't bring chaos and drama to your house. \n\nTalk to your wife. It would be a hill i would be wiling to die on.", "NTA. This woman would be a train wreck and would destroy your home rather than be a gracious houseguest. If your wife wants to help her sister, maybe your wife can help in some other way. For example, helping pay one month's rent for an apartment or something.", "NTA ask your wife if housing her sister is worth a divorce. Because CASH MONEY, next thing you'll see on Facebook is \"BIL hit on me, what do I do!\" \"BIL was with another woman, men aren't loyal.\" \"My sister mistreated me the other night but I can't say anything or they'll kick me out.\"\nThe damage to your life, reputation and anything else is on you... if you let her live with you.", "NTA, and do not let Jill in, even if you have to give your wife an ultimatum. Guests are always 2 yes/1 no. Hold firm.", "NTA\n\nTell your wife that if her sister is gonna lie about her own mother, what kinda lie is she going to spread about you?  Time for her to let go of her sister and for sister to face reality.", "NTA. She sounds absolutely exhausting. I understand your wife's concern but it's too much of a burden to be placed on you (and her!).", "Hah!  (I mean, it gets much worse.)", ">  *She's a pathological liar who focuses her lies on alleging mistreatment by others. It's only a matter of time before she turns on you and your wife as well--let it be over not letting her move in rather than some made-up issue*.\n\nThis explains the whole problem in a nutshell.  OP's SIL could, and probably would, make up accusations that would wreck his life, and could probably involve law enforcement.  \n\nOr, if he has children she might make up things that would get them removed from their home - until the charges were proven false.  \n\nShe likely knows that he doesn't want her living there, so she might target him to remove him from his own home.\n\nProtect yourself, OP.  Don't ever let yourself be alone with this person.  If wife brings her in you need to get a hotel room, and then see an attorney ASAP to find out exactly what your rights are in your state.  \n\nNTA", "Agreed. How long before she makes up a story about you- that results in problems between you & your wife? Within a week.", "Exactly! My guess is it will be less than 1 month before she says OP is trying to get her to have sex with him.\n\nNTA"]}
