There's a reason they won't take her into their homes, so why on earth would your wife want to find out for herself why that is?

OP's SIL could, and probably would, make up accusations that would wreck his life, and could probably involve law enforcement.  \n\nOr, if he has children she might make up things that would get them removed from their home - until the charges were proven false.  \n\nShe likely knows that he doesn't want her living there, so she might target him to remove him from his own home.\n\nProtect yourself, OP.
