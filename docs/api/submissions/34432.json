He hasn\u2019t been super in contact with us due to his issues with his father, but his new fianc\u00e9e has been amazing, helping him to heal and open his heart once more. \nWe recently got an invitation for their wedding, and my mom and I were SO excited. My mom and I have been on a weight loss journey together, and she\u2019s lost a lot of weight. I\u2019m so proud of her. She says she wants to wear something fancy by wedding time to show off her weight loss. That\u2019s not the problem though. \nShe says she wants to wear a white pantsuit to the wedding. Normally I\u2019d be all for this, but I\u2019ve recently (over the past year) learned that a lot of the time white in general is a no-no at weddings. I get it\u2019s not a wedding dress, but still, I don\u2019t want them to think we\u2019re trying to steal the spotlight on their special day. Especially now that both of them are in our lives again. \nI kindly brought this up to my mother, admitting that I\u2019m no expert on weddings, but I shared what I had heard just as a caution. She got SUPER defensive over it and claimed that I knew nothing about the subject. That she had lived long enough to know what she\u2019s doing. I wasn\u2019t trying to talk down to her or demean her at all, I just wanted her to know just in case. \nI\u2019m not sure if it would be a problem to the bride or not, but I only learned recently and wanted her to keep it in mind as well. Now she refuses to talk about it at all. \nAm I the asshole? And would my mom be one if she wore white to their wedding?\n\nEdit: To clear things up\u2026\n1. We are from, and live in the Southern US.\n2. He is not from my mom\u2019s side of the family.\n3. The wedding is a good bit away, and my mom has not gone suit shopping yet, so there is no suit as of now.\n4. My mother is severely introverted, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s seeking to steal the spotlight, but more genuine delusion and wanting to wear a color she was afraid to before.
