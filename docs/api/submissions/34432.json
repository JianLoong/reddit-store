He hasn\u2019t been super in contact with us due to his issues with his father, but his new fianc\u00e9e has been amazing, helping him to heal and open his heart once more. \nWe recently got an invitation for their wedding, and my mom and I were SO excited. My mom and I have been on a weight loss journey together, and she\u2019s lost a lot of weight. I\u2019m so proud of her. She says she wants to wear something fancy by wedding time to show off her weight loss. That\u2019s not the problem though. \nShe says she wants to wear a white pantsuit to the wedding. Normally I\u2019d be all for this, but I\u2019ve recently (over the past year) learned that a lot of the time white in general is a no-no at weddings. I get it\u2019s not a wedding dress, but still, I don\u2019t want them to think we\u2019re trying to steal the spotlight on their special day. Especially now that both of them are in our lives again. \nI kindly brought this up to my mother, admitting that I\u2019m no expert on weddings, but I shared what I had heard just as a caution. She got SUPER defensive over it and claimed that I knew nothing about the subject. That she had lived long enough to know what she\u2019s doing. I wasn\u2019t trying to talk down to her or demean her at all, I just wanted her to know just in case. \nI\u2019m not sure if it would be a problem to the bride or not, but I only learned recently and wanted her to keep it in mind as well. Now she refuses to talk about it at all. \nAm I the asshole? And would my mom be one if she wore white to their wedding?", "created_utc": 1704502152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zmw03/aita_for_saying_my_mom_cant_wear_white_to_my/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you need to warn your cousin and his fianc\u00e9. Seriously. That pant suit may start off white but will be tie dyed by the end of the evening. This will also likely cause your cousin and his bride to go no contact. \n\nYour mother sounds like she has main character syndrome.\n\nHopefully she can hear it from her nephew and his bride and get it through her thick skull that wearing white to a wedding is tacky and rude.", "NTA. Tell her again openly and that you completely disagree with it and tell her that since she\u2019s so old and wise SHE SHOULD KNOW BETTER than to wear ANYTHING WHITE to anyone\u2019s wedding.

But I genuinely think she\u2019s clueless to this, that or she thinks it\u2019s nothing. She\u2019s not the kind to seek all attention on her.

Your Mum can feel nice about her weight and not wear white as that's a big faux pas at a wedding. If she wants to wear a pantsuit she can get one in another colour. Otherwise it does sound like she's being stubborn.", "Tell the bride", "Tell your cousin asap. Your mom is ridiculous", "Oh I am so sorry. She knows exactly what she is doing. She is getting back at your cousin for going low contact with her. It will not matter what you say. What appropriate wedding etiquette is. If a darker color is more slimming.

I've been to a wedding where the bride wore a gorgeous white pantsuit. Your mother might be unaware, but I doubt it. If she persists, she is an AH. She could wear a flattering non-white any color and still be noticed.", "The rule about not wearing white to a wedding doesn\u2019t only apply to dresses or ones that look like wedding dresses. You should also still ask the bride first if it\u2019s okay to wear white if she will be wearing a different colour dress which is common for some brides from different cultures.\n\nUnless your mum has a personal grudge against your cousin and his fianc\u00e9 then I guess she wants to wear the white pant suit because she thinks she looks the best in that outfit rather than trying to steal their spotlight.

You could show her some wedding sites that come up when you google.   You could take the risky route and ask your cousin howbtheyvfeel about guests wearing white.\n\nI would really recommend against that last option though.", "You could ask on your own. Just say, \u201cHi CIL, I have a question. My mom found this amazing pant suit that she would like to wear, but there seems to be a problem, it\u2019s white. I informed my mom that wearing white to someone else\u2019s wedding is not appropriate. However, some people are okay with it. How would you feel about mom wearing a white pant suit to your wedding? Please let me know so I can inform her\u201d.", "Honestly your mother sounds rather toxic", "You tell the beide", "It would be easier for you to just get the bride to weigh in on it so that you're not going to war with your mom.\n\nCould you maybe ask the bride and groom to send out a dress-code request to the guests making sure everyone is aware of what to wear and not to wear, but not just singling out the white issue, maybe add it in subtly to a list? That way your mom won't feel personally attacked and you can avoid the faux pas.", "Then your mom has known from a very early age that only the bride wears white at a wedding. It's virtually impossible for someone not growing up or living in a super restrictive isolated community to not learn this. Heck, you know it, so she does. \n\nTell your cousin and Fad about it, and ask not to be seated with Mom at the reception. Find another relative to ride with or take an Uber. If you must drive there in the same car, refuse to sit with her for the cetemony, leave her at the car, either walk ahead very fast or linger behind. Simply refuse to asdociate eith her if she chooses to do this. Can you possibly stay with another relative or friend, and go with them? Tell you Dad she will embarrass you so much you won't be seen with her. \n\nDress codes, or lists, etc probably won't work.

For example, a colorful, cocktail-length dress with a white lace overlay is acceptable,\" says Lehman. \"A casual sheath dress also works well, but if the dress is white and floor-length or full-skirted, it won't work. If a guest or attendant has any hesitation about appropriate attire, it's usually best to check with the bride, and follow her wishes.\"\n\nAgain, personally I wouldn't do it - especially a white pant suit because that is a lot of white.", "Then find away to give the bridesmaids a heads up so they can make a plan to protect the bride without ruining her day. They will know how she would feel and can advise without adding stress to the happy couple.", "This.", "Tell your cousin's mother.", "Best solution", "I was going to say just this.

Im", "Hate to say it, but flip flopping from lovely to nightmarish/mean is a toxic trait. It keeps you in a state of fawning to keep a person in a good mood because you're worried about their bad side. \nNta. In a lot of western countries white at a wedding is a massive faux pas. Where are you from by the way because I understand different countries have varying customs?", "It's like how abusers love bomb their partners so they don't completely leave", "A lot of Hispanic mothers are like this.
