Your Grandma apparently had no connection to Lori despite what your Dad thinks.  As others have said, if she ever gets her hands on some of it you might actually have to press charges or sue her to get it back, and your family almost definitely would never come back from that.  At this point, there's still a chance they can let go of this and accept that your Grandparents didn't/don't consider her their Granddaughter.  They clearly feel that she should have gotten 1/3rd of the jewelry.  If Lori's actual Grandparents have/had nothing that will eventually pass down to her, that's not your fault.

I don't think there's anything unreasonable about suggesting that if she's close to her stepsister and feels bad, she should reconsider.

There's sentimental attachment.", "You assume. I'm asking OP what their family is like", "NTA. If this was me with my Grandmothers jewelry it\u2019s a hill I would die on. I\u2019m curious why your dad thinks his wife and stepdaughter are entitled to Anything from your Moms parents\nEdit to say I thought these were your mothers parents. Reading again it doesn\u2019t say that so im assuming dad\u2019s parents. Still the same vote though. NTA.", "At this point i think its almost viewed as a family tradition since many women in her 'family' have worn it on their wedding days. \nYour grandmather may not have lent it. But i have to ask, when you look at it, Does it belong to you? Or do you see it as Grandmother's necklace?\nIf the first, you are free to use it or lend it as you see fit. If you want it to be almost a new tradition you want to start with your necklace. Or if you're personally not willing to lend it because it feels(or dosent feel) right to you. If the second, then you will probably treat the necklace much as your grandmother would to carry on her memory that way. \n\nNeither choice is wrong.", "You\u2019re probably right that she\u2019d try to keep the necklace since there was already anger at not being left jewelry. I loaned a necklace to my SIL for her wedding and ended up gifting it to her after because now it had more sentimental meaning to her.", "I am aware that he is one of her parents.  I meant for him to buy Lori the jewellery, but allowed for the fact that it didn't have to be him.", "Well there clearly is, given that your grandfather is happy to treat one of his grandchildren like shit?", "It doesn\u2019t sound like the father and grandparents had much of a relationship. That\u2019s what \u201cLC\u201d means\u2026. Why would you assume there was a relationship between the step-daughter and the grandparents that weren\u2019t her grandparents when the stepfather and his parents are LC? None of what you suggests makes sense. It sounds like the step-daughter wants to wear a nice piece of jewellery that has no connection to her in a meaningful way. And, what is really important about a wedding, who you\u2019re marrying and the people at the wedding? Or, the jewellery you wear? As far as I know, the only important piece of jewellery at a wedding are the wedding rings\u2026.", "Relatives do not equal family. Her dad hasn't been in good terms with his mother, the woman who originally owned the necklace, for years. And she was the one who started the tradition, it's  not a necklace that has been passed down for many generations. Lori didn't have a relationship with the grandmother, and the grandmother didn't consider her family. Maybe she was an asshole who didn't accept Lori because she wasn't biologically related, maybe something else is going on. Either way, the only reason  anyone would want to wear the necklace of a person who rejected them on their wedding day is to stick it to that person after death. OP isn't an asshole for refusing to facilitate that.", "In other comments the op says that the stepdaughter was included in family events growing up and that the low contact state was very recent between the dad and his parents. It also wasn't due to a disagreement, but more that they are all strong personalities and once the kids were grown Dad just stopped socializing with Grandma on a regular basis. The stepdaughter grew up with this family being her family. The sister and cousin that she grew up with wore a family heirloom to their weddings, it was the cousins something borrowed. It's clearly been established as a tradition. Was it weird that this girl thought the girl she grew up with as a sister might have as much affection towards her as a cousin? Are you really unaware of the \"something borrowed\" tradition? Or the significance of family heirlooms and traditions in weddings? Really?", "I get that they didn't want to gift any of the pieces to her, that's their choice. And obviously these belong to you now so you are more than in the right to say who can and cannot borrow/wear any of the items.\n\nBut I am also super nosy (sorry), so is there a reason why your grandfather doesn't even want it loaned to her for her wedding day? It sounds to me like even though she's been around for over 20 years, and you say there isn't any animosity that she isn't considered family.\n\nStill NTA though, just curious and nosy.", "There\u2019s definitely animosity if your grandfather doesn\u2019t even want your stepsister to be able to borrow the necklace for a day. People may be acting nice, but it seems they never considered their daughter-in-law and her child as family.", "Are you at all aware that there is a wide field of emotional options between loving and hating someone?  OP has given no indication that she \"hates\" Lori.", "That\u2019s possible. It\u2019s also possible that OP\u2019s father and her stepmom favored Lori over OP. But ultimately it\u2019s OP\u2019s necklace now and she doesn\u2019t have to lend it out. Sometimes my mom lets me borrow her very expensive jewelry, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. As long as OP let Lori down politely, it\u2019s totally fine. Honestly the weirdest part is how in-the-middle of this OP\u2019s father has become. Makes me think he is telling Lori she is entitled to borrow the necklace.", "Who\u2019s hurt? The necklace is sentimental to OP. It isn\u2019t sentimental to Lori it\u2019s a just a necklace."]}
