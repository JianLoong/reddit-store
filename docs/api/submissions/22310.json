Your Grandma apparently had no connection to Lori despite what your Dad thinks.  As others have said, if she ever gets her hands on some of it you might actually have to press charges or sue her to get it back, and your family almost definitely would never come back from that.  At this point, there's still a chance they can let go of this and accept that your Grandparents didn't/don't consider her their Granddaughter.  They clearly feel that she should have gotten 1/3rd of the jewelry.  If Lori's actual Grandparents have/had nothing that will eventually pass down to her, that's not your fault.

I don't think there's anything unreasonable about suggesting that if she's close to her stepsister and feels bad, she should reconsider.

You could be the bigger person, set an example, tell your grandpa that your stepsister is part of the family, too or something, help him transcend himself, too. Build love and trust.

Family means what it means to them, everyone can agree or disagree with that.\n\nTelling someone they can't borrow something of yours isn't \"nasty\", unless you think that someone is entitled to everything they ask for.", "NAH - If I was 9 years old when a parent figure entered my life, I could definitely see myself seeing them as a dad.  I certainly have friends where this happened.\n\nIf I saw him as a dad, I'd see his parents as my grandparents and I'd feel incredibly hurt that I'm purposefully excluded and it's made clear that I don't get to be a part of the family.  That would have nothing to do with my choices, through some other conflict between my dad and his parents I get made to feel like an outsider.\n\nThat must be incredibly depressing and hurtful.\n\nThat said, focusing on the jewelry isn't the right solution here and there's no reason to share it if you don't want to.", "Their responses say a lot. You're not TA, they definitely are.", "NTA, How long has your dad been married to your stepmom?\n\nGet it appraised and have it in a secure location.  I'd make it clear to your dad that this was your grandparent's wish and you're honoring it and should it disappear, you'll press charges.  There's a reason why they didn't leave anything to your stepmom or stepsister and your dad has to accept it", "There is a good possibility that your stepsister would accidentally lose the necklace and would be unable to return it.  She would be so very sorry and your dad would tell you to forgive her.  25 years down the road then you would see your stepsister's daughter wearing that necklace at her wedding calling it her family heirloom.  Don't loan it out.... NTA", "NTA. Chances are you never would have gotten the necklace back.", "Nta. They are welcome to ask and you have every right to say no. And you can see that you were right to do so based on their response. For me, it's a red flag and cause for dismissal anytime someone lashes out at me irrationally. Their response shows you that they're both entitled and lack maturity. Your father wasn't even speaking to his parents, they left him/them what they wanted or nothing and now his step daughter wants something from you that she's not entitled to and they're mad. Their character makes me feel yucky", "Oof. This one got a little more complicated at the end and with your comments than I expected. Thought it would be pretty straightforward, you didn\u2019t want to lend it, fair enough, case closed. \n\nEither way, I think you are definitely NTA. It\u2019s your property, you obligated to lend it, and especially if it\u2019s important to you. Plus, you feel you are honoring someone else\u2019s wishes. HOWEVER, after reading your comments, I think your grandparents are the AHs here.\n\nYour dad raised Lori since she was 9. That\u2019s his daughter. Your grandparents don\u2019t get a say in that. I would be pretty upset too if I was your dad and people were excluding one of my children. With this in mind, your grandparents\u2019 reason seems cruel.\n\nSo for your dad\u2019s sake, I think you should ignore your grandparents\u2019 wishes and reconsider. I\u2019m not saying what you should decide, just suggesting you reconsider.", "NTA they act entitled but they are not.", "NTA. Not only don\u2019t lend it, wear it to the wedding. I\u2019m a special kind of petty when it comes to this stuff.", "NTA it belongs to you. Thats really all that matters. You don't wish to loan it, end of story.   \nPLUS how do you know she will give it back? Most people find things for their wedding to be sentimental and 99% of the time in these cases, I feel that they always pull that card.", "NTA Look at it this way. There are a few reasons she might want to wear it:  \n1 To claim it for sentimental reasons afterwards \"It's mine now\". Ridiculous, but this is AITA and we've seen that.  \n2 Because she wants a piece of granny there. Obviously Granny wasn't close to her in life. Pretending she was is fake sentimentality.  \n3 It looks good/ is expensive. That is in no way a good reason.  \nThat she is sending you angry messages just seals the deal. She feels entitled to it. She is not.", "Technically you\u2019re NTA but after reading some of your comments I think there\u2019s a lot more going on here than you\u2019re saying. Seems like you really don\u2019t like Lori and are not happy with her being part of your family. So while you\u2019re NTA you don\u2019t come across too great after reading your comments.", "NTA\n\nWhy would your step sister want to wear a necklace. I am sure it is a lovely necklace but its primary value is sentimental to you and your cousin.\n\nShe had no relationship with the grandparents and it appears that for whatever reason she had a poor relationship since the grandmother actively wouldn't have wanted the step sister to even wear it. \n\nI would imagine there is some kind of back story involved. But at any rate, I don't know why there is an expectation that grandparents have any kind of loving feels towards a step child. The reality is step children - absent unusual circumstances - would not even see step grandparents if a relationship ended through either divorce or death of the step parent.\n\nThat your step sister and father are hounding you to borrow the necklace is ridiculous. There are absolutely gorgeous necklaces one can buy that aren't expensive - high end costume jewelry :-)", "NTA, look I know it sounds unfair to her and your dad. But ultimately your grandmother would rather spit and curse your step sis marriage. In a round about way you are doing them a favor. You know well enough grandma would send bad ju ju.", "NTA because you asked your grandfather and he's not comfortable with it.  That is a good enough reason as well.", "NTA. This is not Lori's family's heirlooms. Lori is not a grand daughter. Your father was estranged from his parents when your grandmother died and came back only to get possessions.", "NTA at all. Your dad is the biggest AH in the whole post", "NTA, asking once was fine but not accepting your answer isn\u2019t.", "Have a replica made and lend her that one. Everyone will be happy. Let her know what you did later on when she pisses you off. Win win.", "NTA.  She is not related to your grandmother.  Your grandfather doesn't want her wearing his wife's jewelry.  You don't want her to wear it either.  She'll have to start her own tradition.", "NTA. Don't internalize any of that judgment about what you should do with your heirloom jewelry (hell, with ANY of your belongings).\n\nETA: neither her wedding day nor her marriage will be diminished when she does not wear the necklace.", "NTA. It was ok to ask. It was ok and quite reasonable for you to say no. Their reaction made them TA. It shows they never intended to respect you.", "NTA\n\nLook...let's forget about your grandparents', father's and stepsister's wishes.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that you simply don't want to lend it, for whatever reason. How do I know? Because if you wanted, you wouldn't even ask your grandfather, you would have simply agreed to lend your stepsister the jewelry.\n\nBut since you don't, you just don't have to. And it's ok and it will never make you the asshole.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t let her wear a family heirloom from someone not her family. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. your dad already tried that before grandma passed  and it didn\u2019t work, hence why they were LC. he knew that she and your grandfather didn\u2019t want that and they tried to disregard that and are now harassing you. i would go LC and make sure the necklace is stored somewhere safe like a deposit box or at a safe relatives (maybe MIL/FIL) home.", "YTA! Don\u2019t let anyone convince you otherwise. \n\nWhat would it matter?", "NTA, and give it to your grandfather for safe keeping until the wedding is done. You don't think she'd damage or keep this necklace. Most of the redditors think she will. Bow to the wisdom of the crowd and keep this out of her hands. Don't risk the worst-case scenario.", "They've been married for 20 years.\n\nIt's been appraised, and my home is extremely secure. It's also in a different country to where my father lives.", "Thank-you\n\nAlso, why would you want to wear a piece of jewelry from a person who didn't care enough to give you an inheritance? Why give them the metaphorical centre stage at your wedding.", "Please get it appraised and have it well secured.  Let your dad know that you'll press charges should it disappear", "OP said in a comment that it is from dads family. But he wasn't in good standing with his mother when she passed.", "You are a good person. Trying to give your dad the benefit of the doubt. But you are not in the wrong.", "Do you know why your father went low contact with his parents?", "Is it possible that she was also excluded from the family even though she was a little child when introduced to it? Their rage about the inheritance could be a reflection of their general disappointment.", "Thanks OP. Based on this, I don't think your father was an AH for asking, he may just have wanted Lori to feel like she belonged to the family. But I think his and Lori's unwillingness to accept your decision makes this NTA for me. That said, I think it would help to talk to him about it, see if you can help him understand your reasoning. It's worth considering how this might affect your relationship with your father going forward (assuming it's not something you want to put at risk; the calculus is entirely different if the relationship is already in trouble), and how it might make you feel if things didn't go do well after this.", "Lori is a STEP sister, not a half. So no connection to the grandmother / grandfater who passed along the necklace.", "Bot.

Look pretty!\u201d", "Hey, you asked, I gave my opinion. You've made it clear this is not so much about the necklace than about making sure your stepsister knows she's not family, that your grandparents were clear she was not family and you will be continuing this tradition by this gesture. Like I said, I get boundaries but this is less about the necklace and more about letting Lori know she is not family to you guys. My perspective is to be the bigger person and make a gesture to show her that she is family. That's all. Good luck. In general, you plant ice, you harvest wind.", "Maybe you wouldn't even lend it to your best friend for a wedding? That's totally fine and I don't think anyone should feel entitled to anything. \n\nYour dad should have had this argument with his parents. It's unfair to put you on the spot. It's also very poor taste of them to attack you over your decision.", "I agree. It sure seems like there\u2019s more going on here by some of the comments OP has made about Lori. I feel bad for Lori to come into this family at age 9 and to be treated as an \u201cother\u201d after supposedly having a decent relationship with the grandparents. The whole thing is just weird.", "The OP has a golden opportunity here to mend a lot of hurt using a simple gesture with a material object - and maybe even help folks who are hateful (with reason or not) be bigger and transcend themselves by showing compassion but again, this is not the trend I see in today's world. Selfish, all about themselves, not willing to be the bigger person and above all materialistic to the point of placing things above people. Maybe the stepmom did something? Who knows. But this kind of petty meanness in the guise of 'boundaries' does seem odd. As are the multitudes of folks egging the OP on to make someone feel excluded, someone who is supposedly in her own family even if just by marriage. My favorite aunt is not a blood relative, for example. We have lots of blended folks and adopted folks in my family. The more love and grace we can show each another in our short time on this plane is worth it."]}
