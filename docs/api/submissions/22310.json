They, not you, are completely selfish and have no respect for you or for your late grandmother.  Obviously, if your father is LC with his father, there is plenty of history that justifies that alienation and it strikes me as odd that he wants his daughter's wedding to be memorialize with her wearing a piece of jewellery that came from the people that he wants little to do with.  If Lori's mother doesn't have any heirloom jewellery to pass on to her daughter, then now is an excellent time for one of Lori's parents to buy some and start a tradition for future generations.\n\nNTA", "They asked, you answered.

You said no.  That should have been the end of it.", "NTA\n\nThis YOUR family heirloom, not hers.   This was a gift to YOU.  \n\nYour SS has no connection whatsoever to the original owner.  Don't weaken the sentimental value of your jewelry by just allowing others to wear it.   \n\nYour cousin shared a grandmother with you, so it had meaning for your cousin.    \n\nAnyone who would \"sent me several angry messages\" because they didn't get what they want, is not a good person.

They are not good people.  And bad people (i.e. not good) do not deserve to wear the necklace.\n\nIt's not like she promised the necklace 6 months ago and changed her mind.  She NEVER promised the necklace.

It is perfectly okay for you to have things for yourself from the maternal side of your family. In this situation, the heirloom is for the immediate-related family only. \"No.\" is a full sentence, and your father and step-sister have no right to guilt you into this. Who knows, your SS may even try to keep it for her children to \"keep the family tradition going.\" They will either get over this or not, but I would make this my hill to die on.", "NTA. I am sure your grandmother would be supportive of your decision. \n\nI am confused about the ages though. If Lori is older than you did your father have her while he was still with your mother?", "INFO: You say your dad married your stepmother when Lori was 9, and your grandmother passed away a few years ago.

Trust your gut instinct", "NTA\n\nYou made the right decision protecting the family heirloom as you Dad was comfortable making it available outside the family. \n\nLori's texts are indicative of her feelings of entitlement over your property.

Also you are honouring your grandparents", "You're NTA in this case, but I wanted to ask this first.

It sounds like he'd already told Lori she could wear it and is now p****d that you've said no.  \n\nI would also make sure that your jewellery is safely locked up - maybe even keep it at your grandparents or in another safe place, as if your dad / Lori are so determined that she's going to wear it, you can't rule out it being 'borrowed' to facilitate this. \n\nI'd also go LC with them for a while.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA, your grandmother left her jewelry collection to you and your cousin only.  She did not see Lori as a granddaughter.  You stated your dad and his parents had been LC for years.  There is not sentimental reason for her to want to wear this at her wedding.

Maybe this necklace is really amazing, but more likely it's just a nice piece of jewelry, and Lori could find something equally nice to wear from her own family. It has not sentimental value to her, since she didn't have a good relationship with the grandmother, and probably not to the father either, if he was estranged from his mother. The real issue is the grandparents not accepting the new wife and Lori (which they are maybe assholes about, who knows), and they want Lori to wear the necklace on her wedding day to get the last \"word\".", "I'd be afraid of it getting damaged.

No, my dad didn't have an affair.", "I don't think my dad would let anyone not return it, he knows what the recovery method would be lol. \n\nMy grandparents wanted the tradition of wearing the necklace (and all heirloom jewellery) to stay within the family, hence why the jewellery was divided the way it was."]}
