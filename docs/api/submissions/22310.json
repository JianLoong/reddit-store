They, not you, are completely selfish and have no respect for you or for your late grandmother.  Obviously, if your father is LC with his father, there is plenty of history that justifies that alienation and it strikes me as odd that he wants his daughter's wedding to be memorialize with her wearing a piece of jewellery that came from the people that he wants little to do with.  If Lori's mother doesn't have any heirloom jewellery to pass on to her daughter, then now is an excellent time for one of Lori's parents to buy some and start a tradition for future generations.\n\nNTA", "They asked, you answered.

Just because your grandmother didn't leave her anything doesn't mean she would have been upset about her wearing it for a day. And it sounds like whatever was going on between your grandma and dad wasn't your stepsister's fault, more likely she was caught in the crossfire.\n\nIf you're not close to either of them, I'd say stop worrying about it.
