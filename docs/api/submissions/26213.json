If you'd simply started off with not forcing your daughter to babysit your ex-wife's boyfriend's child then that might be reasonable, especially because there appear to be issues there.  However, you made this about refusing to drop your kids at her boyfriend's house.  I suspect that's what you really have an issue with doing.  Figure out where your concerns and frustrations reside, figure out which one(s) are reasonable and which are not.  Then act accordingly.  I can completely see saying, looking, if you want to hire a babysitter for all the kids and they'll sit for all of them at the boyfriend's house and that's fine but you're not OK with making your daughter sit for another person's children whom she doesn't get along with just to make it easier for you to date your boyfriend.  However, again, that's not what you said initially.  An alternative is to drop the kids at your wife's house and your older daughter sit for your other child and your ex-wife's boyfriend can work out his own childcare.  Kids are not designed to be built-in childcare but they can reasonably be expected to help around the house, including taking care of one's own children.  You sound bitter and resentful and your ex-wife sounds like she's putting her desires above raising her children.  You're divorced.  You're only say in what goes on with your ex-wife's dating should pertain to your children's welfare.

If you are being a pain about the drop off, it is going to mess up your co-parenting situation, and that makes life harder for everyone.

The 2 of them are very alike (lazy lazy lazy) so they already make the kids do almost everything (my 8 YEAR OLD is expected to do everyone\u2019s laundry, for example) when they\u2019re there, but I drew the line at that and told him I\u2019d better not hear another word about it.  HE chose this, the kids did not, and this child is not theirs, not even their sibling, and that is beyond unreasonable.  I\u2019ve really tried to make co parenting work, but he really does make it almost impossible because he always thinks he\u2019s right (he\u2019s introduced the kids to at least 40 women who he\u2019s been sleeping with, and when I said it was inappropriate he said that I can\u2019t say anything because I introduced them to my boyfriend, and he doesn\u2019t like him \ud83d\ude44.  Just to be clear, after 6 months introduced them to - not made them move in with!! - my 1 boyfriend that I\u2019ve had the entire time and he thinks that equal to him dragging every woman who\u2019ll sleep with him into their lives and home).\nThe kids hate going to his place because of it all - honestly I could write a book - and I\u2019m in the process, (with the support of the therapist he decided my oldest son needed to see because ex husband is totally unable to accept that son will ALWAYS be different owing to his ASD and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with him) of having his parenting time reduced because of it all.  The therapist was very clear with me that although ex husband is paying, my child is his client so his recommendation will be what\u2019s in the best interests of my child, not what ex husband wants, and what he thinks that is.  It\u2019s actually what gave me the push to fight, even tho his family has so much more $ and will try to use that to win, I have actually caring about my children on my side.

She doesn't want to do it.\n\n>he can go have a calm conversation with his ex\n\nIf the ex was willing to make changes, she would have. It's not the first time kid is babysitting, and yet she still is requiring that from her.\n\n>think through his legal options if she\u2019d rather stay at his more.\n\nThat's a long term solution for a situation that is happening right now. And seems to be redundant.\n\n>Instead, he wants to drop the kid at mom\u2019s, where she will then be driven to boyfriend\u2019s and expected to babysit just the same. \n\nAnd he would have shown his kid that he is not ok with the situation.\n\n>Plus she gets to deal with her parents bitching at each other. \n\n... or she gets to see at least one of her parents listening to her and actually helping her. \n\n>You really think OP\u2019s making a positive impact there?\n\nYes. Because the ex is using her child in order to get to spend more time with her new bf. And kid is already tired of this. Must be nice to have at least one of your parents willing to voice his disapproval. \n\nI feel like you are forgetting the fact that the kid is stuck going's to her mom's bf house to babysit for free when she knows all she will get is problems. If you think it's ok to let your kid suffer because you want to have fun with your new relationship, yikes. Kids comes first, bf second. Ex seems to have forgotten that.", "No. I asked how is *this* child abuse - which is specifically in the context OP has provided information about. You have gone way out on a tangent and backfilled a massive assumption. What we do know if that OP has a teenage daughter that the mom makes babysit while in her custody - which given the information provided would be a reasonable exchange regardless of payment occurring or not.", "Yeah, no, you just made up a bunch of details in your head that aren\u2019t in the post. He didn\u2019t talk to his daughter, and there\u2019s zero indication he\u2019s spoken to his ex. In fact, you\u2019re arguing this is clearly a problem that\u2019s been going on for awhile\u2026which means he\u2019s had plenty of time to file for more custody if that\u2019s what his daughter wants, no? If he\u2019s doing that, he can simply drop her off and say \u2018don\u2019t forget, the court date is coming up where you can tell the judge you want to live with me full time.\u2019 to make sure she knows he\u2019s in her corner.\n\nExcept he\u2019s full of shit and just making excuses to be petty to his ex. So that\u2019s why none of that is happening.", "You\u2019re assuming this is the first time the daughter has been forced to babysit. \n\nTo me, it sounds like it is not. \n\nHer mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s child is **not** her responsibility. \n\nForcing her to babysit (and from what it sounds like, yelling at her for things that happen out of her control **because she is a child and cannot control another child**) can definitely be abuse. \n\nI really don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t agree with me.", "You are filling in details like *yelling* and *forced* which are not what OP has described. A teenager not wanting to do something and a child being abused are not the same thing."]}
