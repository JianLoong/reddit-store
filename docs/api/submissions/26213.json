If you'd simply started off with not forcing your daughter to babysit your ex-wife's boyfriend's child then that might be reasonable, especially because there appear to be issues there.  However, you made this about refusing to drop your kids at her boyfriend's house.  I suspect that's what you really have an issue with doing.  Figure out where your concerns and frustrations reside, figure out which one(s) are reasonable and which are not.  Then act accordingly.  I can completely see saying, looking, if you want to hire a babysitter for all the kids and they'll sit for all of them at the boyfriend's house and that's fine but you're not OK with making your daughter sit for another person's children whom she doesn't get along with just to make it easier for you to date your boyfriend.  However, again, that's not what you said initially.  An alternative is to drop the kids at your wife's house and your older daughter sit for your other child and your ex-wife's boyfriend can work out his own childcare.  Kids are not designed to be built-in childcare but they can reasonably be expected to help around the house, including taking care of one's own children.  You sound bitter and resentful and your ex-wife sounds like she's putting her desires above raising her children.  You're divorced.  You're only say in what goes on with your ex-wife's dating should pertain to your children's welfare.

Discuss the babysitting arrangement. Discuss all of it, but in particular discuss that. If you are being a pain about the drop off, it is going to mess up your co-parenting situation, and that makes life harder for everyone.

The 2 of them are very alike (lazy lazy lazy) so they already make the kids do almost everything (my 8 YEAR OLD is expected to do everyone\u2019s laundry, for example) when they\u2019re there, but I drew the line at that and told him I\u2019d better not hear another word about it.  HE chose this, the kids did not, and this child is not theirs, not even their sibling, and that is beyond unreasonable.  I\u2019ve really tried to make co parenting work, but he really does make it almost impossible because he always thinks he\u2019s right (he\u2019s introduced the kids to at least 40 women who he\u2019s been sleeping with, and when I said it was inappropriate he said that I can\u2019t say anything because I introduced them to my boyfriend, and he doesn\u2019t like him \ud83d\ude44.

The therapist was very clear with me that although ex husband is paying, my child is his client so his recommendation will be what\u2019s in the best interests of my child, not what ex husband wants, and what he thinks that is.  It\u2019s actually what gave me the push to fight, even tho his family has so much more $ and will try to use that to win, I have actually caring about my children on my side.
