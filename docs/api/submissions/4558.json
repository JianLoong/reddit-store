I guess I have been living a kind of sheltered life, and I wasn't thinking about the wedding the way I should have - I was kind of viewing it as a big party, more like a birthday party, than a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that was a mistake. \n\nHanna asked me if I could get coffee with her outside of the house, and I was a little surprised that she wanted to meet that way but I obviously said yes, I was getting really worried that she wasn't going to respond at all. But I think that was the best decsion ever because Hanna and I had a great conversation, it was kind of intense but I think really necessary, about some stuff that happened when we were kids and our relationship with our mom. I won't go into all of it here but TLDR, Hanna apologized for trying to wake me up whenever she visited, I apologized for laughing about her wedding, and we both agreed that I need to A) talk to more doctors and B) move out of our mother's house.\n\nWe grew up pretty sheltered, and I hadn't realized how much it was impacting my mood and energy until Hanna started talking about what she experienced when she moved out and went to college. She left home pretty early, at sixteen, so we really didn't know each other as adults much at all. Hanna told me that when she first moved out, everything got easier with our mother, and she started going to therapy and got really into fitness and nutrition, and she realized that she felt a lot better with less contact with our family, but she got really worried about me being left home, and wanted to check up on me/encourage me to move out too, but didn't know how to communicate that, particularly since I was always sleeping when she was over.\n\nI have some money saved from freelancing and saving on rent, so I am going to think about different places to move to. My job can be done from anywhere so now that I'm thinking about moving out it feels weird that I was so stuck in my high school routine that I didn't even consider any other options.\n\nMy sleeping schedule is still super fucked up but Hanna has a friend who is a nutritionist that is willing to do a consult with me over Zoom, so that's something I'm going to do next week. I called my family doctor and asked for referrals but the only available appointment slot is like two months out, and I'm not sure if I will even be in the state at that point, so I didn't book it yet but I'm definitely going to try and get a medical team once I know what my plans are.\n\nThanks again to everyone, particularly everyone who messaged me directly with advice <3", "created_utc": 1670865751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk57qr/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_sisters/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Great news sleepyhead!", "I'm glad you two were able to work it out and you have plans to get yourself on a road to wellness.", "So glad you were able to gracefully accept the advice here and from your sister. Rooting for you!", "So happy for you!!!", "I'm so glad that your relationship with your sister is improving. Remember, nutrition can do a lot, but also in a bad way. Make sure you can go to a specialist before you start changing everything about your food.", "That's great news! \n\nI think you'll find that your sleep will change when you get into a different environment.", "I'm glad you will be able to see the doctor. I was shocked when you said you're doctor didn't think it was a big deal. And even that you didn't think it was a big deal when it impacts everything in your life in an obvious way. Good luck with the doctors.", "I'm glad you worked things out.\n\nMake the appointment with the Dr. If you can't be there cancel it with enough time that they can give it to someone else. You might still be close enough to go, and waiting lists for appointments like this can get longer.", "I\u2019m glad you talked to your sister and worked things out! Good luck with your future move!", "Glad there's a nice resolution using good old dialogue. \n\nSo here's my armchair advice of how to beat insomnia, and that is strenuous exercise to tire you out. Such as late night running for 2 hours. But wait, some of you might ask, that could be dangerous for most young women. To which I say, simply run faster.", "Great news! As someone who used to have a similar problem as you, I'd also recommend seeing a neurologist to rule out narcolepsy (which can surprisingly cause severe insomnia) because that is what ended up being my issue. Best of luck to you!", "you don\u2019t need a nutritionist lmao you need a doctor"]}
