I guess I have been living a kind of sheltered life, and I wasn't thinking about the wedding the way I should have - I was kind of viewing it as a big party, more like a birthday party, than a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that was a mistake. \n\nHanna asked me if I could get coffee with her outside of the house, and I was a little surprised that she wanted to meet that way but I obviously said yes, I was getting really worried that she wasn't going to respond at all. But I think that was the best decsion ever because Hanna and I had a great conversation, it was kind of intense but I think really necessary, about some stuff that happened when we were kids and our relationship with our mom. I won't go into all of it here but TLDR, Hanna apologized for trying to wake me up whenever she visited, I apologized for laughing about her wedding, and we both agreed that I need to A) talk to more doctors and B) move out of our mother's house.\n\nWe grew up pretty sheltered, and I hadn't realized how much it was impacting my mood and energy until Hanna started talking about what she experienced when she moved out and went to college. She left home pretty early, at sixteen, so we really didn't know each other as adults much at all. Hanna told me that when she first moved out, everything got easier with our mother, and she started going to therapy and got really into fitness and nutrition, and she realized that she felt a lot better with less contact with our family, but she got really worried about me being left home, and wanted to check up on me/encourage me to move out too, but didn't know how to communicate that, particularly since I was always sleeping when she was over.\n\nI have some money saved from freelancing and saving on rent, so I am going to think about different places to move to. My job can be done from anywhere so now that I'm thinking about moving out it feels weird that I was so stuck in my high school routine that I didn't even consider any other options.\n\nMy sleeping schedule is still super fucked up but Hanna has a friend who is a nutritionist that is willing to do a consult with me over Zoom, so that's something I'm going to do next week. I called my family doctor and asked for referrals but the only available appointment slot is like two months out, and I'm not sure if I will even be in the state at that point, so I didn't book it yet but I'm definitely going to try and get a medical team once I know what my plans are.\n\nThanks again to everyone, particularly everyone who messaged me directly with advice <3", "created_utc": 1670865751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk57qr/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_sisters/", "score": 907, "replies": ["Great news sleepyhead!", "I'm glad you two were able to work it out and you have plans to get yourself on a road to wellness.", "So glad you were able to gracefully accept the advice here and from your sister.

Good luck with the doctors.", "I'm glad you worked things out.\n\nMake the appointment with the Dr. If you can't be there cancel it with enough time that they can give it to someone else. You might still be close enough to go, and waiting lists for appointments like this can get longer.", "I\u2019m glad you talked to your sister and worked things out! Good luck with your future move!", "[removed]", "Great news!

Find out their cancellation policy.  And if you move cancel before you have pay a fee. If you don't move you can go.  ..I hope you find a nice place to live.", "Book it. you can always cancel if you find something else sooner.

I hope the wedding goes well. And yes to finding a new doctor!", "Glad to hear this update!  I too am a night owl. If I don't set alarms I'll look up and it'll be 2am without me ever noticing.   Sadly, most of the world runs day light hours so I gotta adjust.", "Also, have you talked to a counselor. Have you suffered from depression? And also, set an alarm to clock and get your ass out of bed. You don't have to stay up to all hours of the night. Cut food off at a certain time before you want to go to bed, shut off the computer and phone at that time too, and make an effort.  Set the alarm for 10:00 a.m., then go to 9:00 a.m., and and then earlier. You can make the habit", "Search for a sleep center in your area that has sleep medicine doctors and sleep psychologists. There is so much that can help!", "While you\u2019re waiting for a medical consult, come hang with us over in r/dspd. If you do have DSPD, a nutritionist is unlikely to be of help.

He's had similar sleeping patterns for a long while.\n\nWishing you and your sister the best!", "Good for you!! Also, consider talking to a doctor about a possible depression diagnosis. I thought I couldn\u2019t possibly be depressed as a teen, and I didn\u2019t really understand till I was in college that I wasn\u2019t a sad depressed, just a very tired one. \n\nAdditional tip: \nWhen you move out, make sure that your bedroom is ONLY for sleeping. Don\u2019t hang out in bed. Don\u2019t read in bed. Don\u2019t work in bed. This will make sure that you and your body associates your bed with sleeping and you can get to sleep faster.", "I had terrible insomnia for years and saw a sleep psychologist who actually helped me more than the sleep studies and specialists did. If you can't find relief through other specialists maybe try to find one in your area! My whole life changed!", "Doctors appointments everywhere are two months out.\n\nBook it. \n\nIf you move, cancel it with a few days notice and its fine.

Cancel if you move in the meantime. \n\nAnything sleep related has massive health and life consequences, so treat this matter with some urgency. Good luck.", "I have struggled with insomnia, and it is generally related to some other underlying mental issues as well. For me, it was my chronic anxiety. I have gone with like 10 hours of sleep in 7 days due to insomnia so I know. Then my sleep cycle was fucked up most of my life, I gained weight and that escalated my PCOD. It was a shit situation overall. Now finally when I live with my husband and have gone to therapy so much and have been working in a job where I have to get up at 6.30am every single day, I am finally able to get 6 to 7 hours of sleep every night which is a big win for me. Apart from a nutritionist, I will suggest also see a therapist.", "Good to hear things are moving forward... Not sure if allowed - but circle back once you dig deeper into the medical aspect of the sleep issues!! \n\nNutrition is very important and a great first step!! Yet use caution that it would be a one and done fix.  If it hasn't been mentioned yet - don't dismiss Universities (w/Medical Schools attached) as a source or a place to start for help/referrals.   Not only as full service care with \"in-house\" referrals; but some offer sliding scale costs (fees based on your income) and also many engage in research.  Many research programs are free for services and sometimes even pay patients to be involved.  (Do a search for \"sleep issues university research programs\" you can add your state/city at the end of the search to narrow it down to be more local)  Good Luck!", "OP, book the appointment with the specialist and then call every few days and ask if there are any cancellations or whatever and see if they can move your appointment up.", "Book it! These specialist appts are very hard to get. So book it now, while it's available, and if it looks like you're not going to keep it because you're moving (yay!), you can always cancel it a few days ahead of time. \n\nI read your original post and am so happy things worked out this way! Best of luck to you, sleep muffin!", "Great update! So nice that you talked, and I wish you and your sister the best of luck. I'm glad that your sister helped you see that you are not helpless when it comes to your health. It's a journey for sure, but it's *your* ship.", "Nice update--just wanted to let you know that when I was living with my parents, my sleeping habit was like yours where I slept during the day and was up all night.  It wasn't something I did purposefully but if left to naturally sleep/wake, etc... I would just end up with a schedule like yours.  Now, I do suffer from some insomnia which, thankfully, is currently under control but my insomnia was actually SEPARATE from that sleep issue.  It turns out I was depressed, anxious, etc. in the environment I was in and my natural defense/response was to basically sleep and switch into a schedule opposite everyone else's.  It took a while to \"correct\" (and then we could actually tackle the real insomnia) but once I was living on my own for a while, I did find that my schedule, while still not \"normal\" became closer to it (I still am more awake/wired at night so I tend to get most work done at night).  I always assumed I was more of a night owl and that was why I couldn't sleep at my parents' but when I saw my cousin start doing the same thing when she moved in with my parents when she had never had any sleep issues or anything, it occurred to me that it was likely a way of dealing with an environment we found toxic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't to say you are in the same situation but it doesn't hurt to keep this possibility in mind as well.  Certainly you should still look into seeing more doctors but you may find that just being away from your mom's place will end up doing wonders for your mental--and sleep- healthy.", "Hey Op. Have you ever heard of Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder? It's a chronic condition that effects the REM cycle. And what you are describing sounds exactly like it. If you do have it, it's important to understand that it is not something you can control. I know this because I have it myself. And I spent a lot of my life trying to live on a 'normal' day schedule and became incredibly sick and suicidal due to the lack of sleep. Nowadays, I have a midshift schedule and am able to get the sleep that the human body requires to live. All this to say, it sounds like you have a legitimate disability and should talk to a sleep specialist/neurologist. Every now and then, it's totally reasonable for anyone to get up early (early to you may not be early to everyone else and that is ok) especially for things as important as a wedding. But not always. And it's not ok that everyone is dismissing what seems to be a very real illness. Making up with your family is good. Going to your sisters wedding is good. But ignoring your health in general is not. Nor is your family (and everyone in this sub apparently) expecting you to always conform to a schedule that isn't possible for you on a regular basis. Illnesses come in lots of different shapes, sizes, and forms.", "NTA. You told her you would skip brunch but attend the rest of the festivities. Then she had a bridezilla attack. My husband is on his 30+ third shift year and people think he has all day to do stuff because he's home. The man works, he leaves at 8:30 pm and return home at 7:30 in the morning. He needs to sleep during the day. Insomnia is the same thing, you sleep when your body allows you. I know my thoughts are not the majority, but you take care of you. If you can, it will be great to go, but if your sister really loves you, and I'm sure she does, she doesn't want to see a zombie with huge bags around their eyes!", "Thanks for the update! It\u2019s so good to hear that you and your sisters were able to have a heart-to-heart as two mature adults.", "I agree. This was a really nice update! OP, I'm glad you're in a better place with your sis and you are on your way to changing your life for the better. Kudos and thank you for the update!", "Some doctors suck. My pediatrician dismissed my mom and my concerns when, at 13, I started vomiting randomly, for HOURS- every 5 minutes, for 8+ hours, with no obvious cause. Couldn't keep anything down. Said it was normal and I'd grow up and grow out of it. It kept getting worse over time, but pediatrician was never concerned \n\nSpoiler alert, it didn't go away in time. It's actually a super rare congenital defect. Part of my digestive tract is straight up the wrong cell type, and it only showed up once I started growing (best guess is as a kid, I was small enough that hormones that regulate that cell type elsewhere could still reach and act on the f'ed cells, but that stopped as I got bigger). I have to take meds to regulate those cells or they cause severe acidosis, which was causing the extreme vomiting. I was functionally flirting with an acute medical emergency and risking organ failure every few weeks. NBD \ud83d\ude44\n\nBy the time a doc actually caught it (after insisting I was magically pregnant for, at that point, over 6 years straight while a virgin) more than 98% of my esophagus had been chemically scarred, and parts of my throat as well. If it had been caught when mom first brought it up, we probably could have gotten a handle on it earlier and had no lasting damage.", "I\u2019ve noticed this happening to several friends. I think many doctors live with severe sleep deprivation during residency and so, they think it\u2019s normal. A friend of mine rarely Sleeps more than 3 hours a night, and MDs have told him not to worry about it", "Hi, I'm definitely going to book with other specialists, the nutritionist is just one part of the medical team I hope to put together, I just mentioned her explicitly since I already have that appointment scheduled and I think it's nice that my sister helped me connect with her friend", "Narcolepsy or Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome. I have a friend with dsps and it's a significant issue for her because she just can't sleep until 2am, because her circadian rhythm is just totally reversed.", "Ok. I just saw that you do have DSPD. And yeah, you can't expect everything (especially something big like a wedding) to be planned around you, but it sounds like your family is generally dismissive of what is a very real and very difficult illness. This wedding is one thing, but you should also have a discussion with them about how they wake up when you need to be sleeping and about how you do have a right to some accommodations. You wouldn't wake them up at 3am so it isn't ok for them to wake you up at noon. My family plans events that can be in the afternoon for the afternoon. When they can't, they help me out when I am having to deal with very little sleep. It's a two way street.", "Her symptoms are pretty standard for a sleep phase disorder. It\u2019s not something you can really just handle by going to bed earlier.", "People can become nutritionists by putting up a sign saying they\u2019re a nutritionist. Not even a few online courses are necessary.", "This is really important. Nutritionists may be well intentioned and well informed, but there's not much guarantee of that and a lot aren't. Dieticians are fully qualified doctors who go on to study nutrition and diet.", "Holy cow, I'm so sorry that happened. Nowhere near as severe but at about that age I started having random dizzy spells and spots before my eyes and a rapid heartbeat. Once it happened on vacation in the presence of a family friend who was a medical doctor so I was NOT faking it. Our pediatrician dismissed it completely, saw in the notes later he wrote \"dieting?\" like I was starving myself and sent us home.\n\n20 years later a random doctor says, \"You know you have a heart arrthymia, right?\" How no one else heard it in all those years is beyond me, but I finally felt vindicated that I was not, in fact, crazy.", "I have something like that.\n\nAfter literally 5 years of doctors and diets and pills and not having things and blood tests and sticking things up my ass they finally found out I\u2019m allergic to milk and eggs.\n\nWhy tf did it take 5 years to figure this out?\n\nI was 210 now I weigh 130. Haven\u2019t really been able to work, hold relationships, party with friends, go to a lot of family events, etc. because of this.\n\nAll it took was a fucking nurse practitioner(? I think? Couldn\u2019t see actual doctor) reading all my stuff then getting me a basic blood test. Whereas before I had countless doctors making it legitimately worse for me. It would be \u2018it\u2019s probably lack of fiber in your diet see you in 3 months\u2019 and that would fuck me up even more. Or \u2018marijuana is clearly the issue. I know you told me you only started smoking in response to the pain\u2026 but marijuana clearly started all this\u2019.\n\nReally turned me off doctors tbh, which I know isn\u2019t good. But it was beyond frustrating going to \u2018specialists\u2019 for years and no one having any clue, then my new primary care\u2019s freaking doctor-sidekick-person found the cause.\n\nAggravating!!!", "This isn't anywhere near what you went through, but my doctor was signed-off for about 2 years. During this time we had another doctor, Isabella. She was useless. I won't go into the long list of her incompetencies, but one in particular stood out to me. I was on a medication from a specialist that had a really negative effect on me and made me incredibly uncoordinated and clumsy, and resulted in me hitting my head at an awkward angle. My head was sore, but the impact went straight down my back and I heard a crack and had an awful pain. I was incredibly groggy from the medication, so I tried to ignore it for a couple of days, but by the fourth day I was in agony. I went to urgent care where I saw a nurse who was wonderful. She wanted me to get an x-ray, so got Isabella to see me immediately to schedule an x-ray right away. I get to Isabella, tell her the situation (not very well, I was still ridiculously groggy, but well enough the nurse understood and explained what happened over the phone). Isabella didn't think I needed an x-ray and said I should go home and take some paracetamol. I repeated the nurse thought it was important, and didn't she even want to see for herself? She eventually agreed to examine my back. She did this by poking me twice through 5 layers (it was January) and said \"you have a lot of tension. It's because you have large breasts\". I was 33. They hadn't just appeared the day I hit my head. I don't remember what I said but I did eventually get the x-ray that afternoon, but they made me wait 10 weeks for the results. After 7 weeks I went to a physiotherapist. Turns out I had two upper thoracic vertebrae significantly out of alignment. Two sessions with him fixed it, fortunately. I went back to Isabella because he was concerned about my C1 vertebrae and was hoping to see the x-ray. She actually blanched when she saw my x-ray (really not a good doctor)...", "Ask the doctor about some lesser known sleep disorders that fall under the group, Circadian Rhythm Disorders. \n\nYour symptoms sound similar to Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. But there are other ones in that it could. For years I thought I had insomnia until I found the right doctor and was diagnosed with Non 24-Hour sleep disorder.", "Dieticians do a lot of study and are definitely reliable health professionals, but they aren't \"fully qualified doctors\".", "I bout sent the surgical notes to the pediatrician like \"see??? I wasn't lying or making it up!\"", "It sucks when the people who should be doctors, aren't. A nurse practitioner saved my hearing in my right ear and spent way more time with me than the doctors ever did. I appreciate her so much.", "I'm glad it turned out alright for you, cause it sounds like you were lucky that you hadn't torn anything/didn't further dislocate your vertebrae and damage your spinal cord! That would have been infinitely worse than what I deal with!", "I really was lucky. I was in so much pain I was struggling to cope, and a few friends all independently recommended this physiotherapist. They all warned me his treatment is always astoundingly painful, but just as effective. They were right. He did an amazing job and for only \u20ac50 in total! It really could have been so much worse.\n\nPeople in positions of responsibility for vulnerable people (and in my mind that includes any doctor-patient relationship) not doing their jobs just infuriates me like nothing else. I'm so sorry for everything you went through!"]}
