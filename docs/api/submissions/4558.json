{"id": 4558, "submission_id": "zk57qr", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for not wanting to go to my sisters wedding because of my \"insomnia\"", "selftext": "Original [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcf9fk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_26f_sisters_29f/)\n\nFirst off, it was a big eye opener to see that so many people thought I was the asshole, and after reading your comments I agree with you. I guess I have been living a kind of sheltered life, and I wasn't thinking about the wedding the way I should have - I was kind of viewing it as a big party, more like a birthday party, than a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that was a mistake. \n\nHanna asked me if I could get coffee with her outside of the house, and I was a little surprised that she wanted to meet that way but I obviously said yes, I was getting really worried that she wasn't going to respond at all. But I think that was the best decsion ever because Hanna and I had a great conversation, it was kind of intense but I think really necessary, about some stuff that happened when we were kids and our relationship with our mom. I won't go into all of it here but TLDR, Hanna apologized for trying to wake me up whenever she visited, I apologized for laughing about her wedding, and we both agreed that I need to A) talk to more doctors and B) move out of our mother's house.\n\nWe grew up pretty sheltered, and I hadn't realized how much it was impacting my mood and energy until Hanna started talking about what she experienced when she moved out and went to college. She left home pretty early, at sixteen, so we really didn't know each other as adults much at all. Hanna told me that when she first moved out, everything got easier with our mother, and she started going to therapy and got really into fitness and nutrition, and she realized that she felt a lot better with less contact with our family, but she got really worried about me being left home, and wanted to check up on me/encourage me to move out too, but didn't know how to communicate that, particularly since I was always sleeping when she was over.\n\nI have some money saved from freelancing and saving on rent, so I am going to think about different places to move to. My job can be done from anywhere so now that I'm thinking about moving out it feels weird that I was so stuck in my high school routine that I didn't even consider any other options.\n\nMy sleeping schedule is still super fucked up but Hanna has a friend who is a nutritionist that is willing to do a consult with me over Zoom, so that's something I'm going to do next week. I called my family doctor and asked for referrals but the only available appointment slot is like two months out, and I'm not sure if I will even be in the state at that point, so I didn't book it yet but I'm definitely going to try and get a medical team once I know what my plans are.\n\nThanks again to everyone, particularly everyone who messaged me directly with advice <3", "created_utc": 1670865751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk57qr/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_sisters/", "score": 2997, "replies": ["Great news sleepyhead!", "I'm glad you two were able to work it out and you have plans to get yourself on a road to wellness.", "So glad you were able to gracefully accept the advice here and from your sister.

It was a shit situation overall. Now finally when I live with my husband and have gone to therapy so much and have been working in a job where I have to get up at 6.30am every single day, I am finally able to get 6 to 7 hours of sleep every night which is a big win for me.

Not sure if allowed - but circle back once you dig deeper into the medical aspect of the sleep issues!! \n\nNutrition is very important and a great first step!!

Not only as full service care with \"in-house\" referrals; but some offer sliding scale costs (fees based on your income) and also many engage in research.

I'm glad that your sister helped you see that you are not helpless when it comes to your health. It's a journey for sure, but it's *your* ship.", "Nice update--just wanted to let you know that when I was living with my parents, my sleeping habit was like yours where I slept during the day and was up all night.  It wasn't something I did purposefully but if left to naturally sleep/wake, etc... I would just end up with a schedule like yours.  Now, I do suffer from some insomnia which, thankfully, is currently under control but my insomnia was actually SEPARATE from that sleep issue.  It turns out I was depressed, anxious, etc. in the environment I was in and my natural defense/response was to basically sleep and switch into a schedule opposite everyone else's.  It took a while to \"correct\" (and then we could actually tackle the real insomnia) but once I was living on my own for a while, I did find that my schedule, while still not \"normal\" became closer to it (I still am more awake/wired at night so I tend to get most work done at night).  I always assumed I was more of a night owl and that was why I couldn't sleep at my parents' but when I saw my cousin start doing the same thing when she moved in with my parents when she had never had any sleep issues or anything, it occurred to me that it was likely a way of dealing with an environment we found toxic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't to say you are in the same situation but it doesn't hurt to keep this possibility in mind as well.  Certainly you should still look into seeing more doctors but you may find that just being away from your mom's place will end up doing wonders for your mental--and sleep- healthy.", "Hey Op. Have you ever heard of Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder? It's a chronic condition that effects the REM cycle. And what you are describing sounds exactly like it. If you do have it, it's important to understand that it is not something you can control. I know this because I have it myself. And I spent a lot of my life trying to live on a 'normal' day schedule and became incredibly sick and suicidal due to the lack of sleep. Nowadays, I have a midshift schedule and am able to get the sleep that the human body requires to live. All this to say, it sounds like you have a legitimate disability and should talk to a sleep specialist/neurologist. Every now and then, it's totally reasonable for anyone to get up early (early to you may not be early to everyone else and that is ok) especially for things as important as a wedding. But not always. And it's not ok that everyone is dismissing what seems to be a very real illness. Making up with your family is good. Going to your sisters wedding is good. But ignoring your health in general is not. Nor is your family (and everyone in this sub apparently) expecting you to always conform to a schedule that isn't possible for you on a regular basis. Illnesses come in lots of different shapes, sizes, and forms.", "NTA. You told her you would skip brunch but attend the rest of the festivities. Then she had a bridezilla attack. My husband is on his 30+ third shift year and people think he has all day to do stuff because he's home. The man works, he leaves at 8:30 pm and return home at 7:30 in the morning. He needs to sleep during the day. Insomnia is the same thing, you sleep when your body allows you. I know my thoughts are not the majority, but you take care of you. If you can, it will be great to go, but if your sister really loves you, and I'm sure she does, she doesn't want to see a zombie with huge bags around their eyes!", "Thanks for the update! It\u2019s so good to hear that you and your sisters were able to have a heart-to-heart as two mature adults.", "I agree. This was a really nice update! OP, I'm glad you're in a better place with your sis and you are on your way to changing your life for the better. Kudos and thank you for the update!", "Some doctors suck. My pediatrician dismissed my mom and my concerns when, at 13, I started vomiting randomly, for HOURS- every 5 minutes, for 8+ hours, with no obvious cause. Couldn't keep anything down. Said it was normal and I'd grow up and grow out of it. It kept getting worse over time, but pediatrician was never concerned \n\nSpoiler alert, it didn't go away in time. It's actually a super rare congenital defect. Part of my digestive tract is straight up the wrong cell type, and it only showed up once I started growing (best guess is as a kid, I was small enough that hormones that regulate that cell type elsewhere could still reach and act on the f'ed cells, but that stopped as I got bigger). I have to take meds to regulate those cells or they cause severe acidosis, which was causing the extreme vomiting. I was functionally flirting with an acute medical emergency and risking organ failure every few weeks. NBD \ud83d\ude44\n\nBy the time a doc actually caught it (after insisting I was magically pregnant for, at that point, over 6 years straight while a virgin) more than 98% of my esophagus had been chemically scarred, and parts of my throat as well. If it had been caught when mom first brought it up, we probably could have gotten a handle on it earlier and had no lasting damage.", "I\u2019ve noticed this happening to several friends. I think many doctors live with severe sleep deprivation during residency and so, they think it\u2019s normal. A friend of mine rarely Sleeps more than 3 hours a night, and MDs have told him not to worry about it", "Hi, I'm definitely going to book with other specialists, the nutritionist is just one part of the medical team I hope to put together, I just mentioned her explicitly since I already have that appointment scheduled and I think it's nice that my sister helped me connect with her friend", "Narcolepsy or Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome. I have a friend with dsps and it's a significant issue for her because she just can't sleep until 2am, because her circadian rhythm is just totally reversed.", "Ok. I just saw that you do have DSPD. And yeah, you can't expect everything (especially something big like a wedding) to be planned around you, but it sounds like your family is generally dismissive of what is a very real and very difficult illness. This wedding is one thing, but you should also have a discussion with them about how they wake up when you need to be sleeping and about how you do have a right to some accommodations. You wouldn't wake them up at 3am so it isn't ok for them to wake you up at noon. My family plans events that can be in the afternoon for the afternoon. When they can't, they help me out when I am having to deal with very little sleep. It's a two way street.", "Her symptoms are pretty standard for a sleep phase disorder.

Dieticians are fully qualified doctors who go on to study nutrition and diet.", "Holy cow, I'm so sorry that happened. Nowhere near as severe but at about that age I started having random dizzy spells and spots before my eyes and a rapid heartbeat. Once it happened on vacation in the presence of a family friend who was a medical doctor so I was NOT faking it. Our pediatrician dismissed it completely, saw in the notes later he wrote \"dieting?\" like I was starving myself and sent us home.\n\n20 years later a random doctor says, \"You know you have a heart arrthymia, right?\" How no one else heard it in all those years is beyond me, but I finally felt vindicated that I was not, in fact, crazy.", "I have something like that.\n\nAfter literally 5 years of doctors and diets and pills and not having things and blood tests and sticking things up my ass they finally found out I\u2019m allergic to milk and eggs.\n\nWhy tf did it take 5 years to figure this out?\n\nI was 210 now I weigh 130. Haven\u2019t really been able to work, hold relationships, party with friends, go to a lot of family events, etc. because of this.\n\nAll it took was a fucking nurse practitioner(? I think?

During this time we had another doctor, Isabella. She was useless. I won't go into the long list of her incompetencies, but one in particular stood out to me. I was on a medication from a specialist that had a really negative effect on me and made me incredibly uncoordinated and clumsy, and resulted in me hitting my head at an awkward angle. My head was sore, but the impact went straight down my back and I heard a crack and had an awful pain. I was incredibly groggy from the medication, so I tried to ignore it for a couple of days, but by the fourth day I was in agony. I went to urgent care where I saw a nurse who was wonderful. She wanted me to get an x-ray, so got Isabella to see me immediately to schedule an x-ray right away. I get to Isabella, tell her the situation (not very well, I was still ridiculously groggy, but well enough the nurse understood and explained what happened over the phone). Isabella didn't think I needed an x-ray and said I should go home and take some paracetamol. I repeated the nurse thought it was important, and didn't she even want to see for herself? She eventually agreed to examine my back. She did this by poking me twice through 5 layers (it was January) and said \"you have a lot of tension. It's because you have large breasts\". I was 33. They hadn't just appeared the day I hit my head. I don't remember what I said but I did eventually get the x-ray that afternoon, but they made me wait 10 weeks for the results. After 7 weeks I went to a physiotherapist. Turns out I had two upper thoracic vertebrae significantly out of alignment. Two sessions with him fixed it, fortunately. I went back to Isabella because he was concerned about my C1 vertebrae and was hoping to see the x-ray. She actually blanched when she saw my x-ray (really not a good doctor)...", "Ask the doctor about some lesser known sleep disorders that fall under the group, Circadian Rhythm Disorders. \n\nYour symptoms sound similar to Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder.

Settle down with the \u201cyou must see a doctor\u201d advice!   I am a fucking doctor!  I have always been very nocturnal.  It was a struggle my whole life!  So I chose a career that would allow me to have a schedule that works with my sleep.  I am an ER Dr that works nights!  I get paid more to work nights because nobody else wants to!  I got to negotiate for A LOT more money to work only nights!  I get PAID MORE because of my sleep habits!  I am very healthy and I am a champion sleeper during the daytime with my shades and shutter to make my room nice and dark.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to change anything and see a bunch of doctors to \u201cmake you better\u201d!  You already said you do freelance work which means you can work anytime that works for you.   Just know that you will occasionally have to go on little sleep when you have to do daytime things with the rest of the world because nobody seems to want to have meetings/weddings in the middle of the night to accommodate my sleep schedule.  \n\nBut I worked my life and career around my sleep cycle and you can too if you want to.  (Now luckily I don\u2019t have kids and I assume that would be different if you had kids that required sleep at normal hours.) \n\nSo take it for what it\u2019s worth, but I just want you to know that there are very normal nocturnal people out here that can turn their sleep habits to their advantage.

Always cherish your siblings :)\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery for your insomnia.", "Hey friend, don't know if anyone mentioned it yet but you should look into delayed sleep phase disorder/syndrome. It's a circadian rhythm disorder where your brain doesn't make melatonin at the \"appropriate\" time, meaning you can't sleep until very late and you feel perpetually jetlagged. It's notoriously difficult to treat too, e.g. you can't just go to bed earlier or get up earlier, sleep hygiene does very little to help most of us, \"you'll sleep when you're tired\" isn't a thing, and the vast majority of the population does not understand what this is like because they don't struggle with it. To them it looks like laziness, hence people waking you up in the middle of your \"night\" because everyone else is up why aren't you up yet you should have gone to bed earlier why were you up so late etc ad nauseum.\n\nJust putting this out there because if you DO have DSPD you will probably have a hard time finding a doctor who knows about it. It's quite rare in adults (about 0.16% of the adult population has it) because most people who develop it on adolescence grow out of it by adulthood. It's commonly misdiagnosed as insomnia or a mental health issue when it's really a neurological difference that you don't get to control. Your brain is literally wired differently than people with a \"normal\" sleep schedule.\n\nI would suggest heading on over to the r/DSPD sub for more information. You'll want to call and vet doctors ahead of time before seeing them to make sure they know about DSPD or you're likely to get misdiagnosed. You can do this by calling to talk to their nurse to confirm that this is a thing that doctor diagnoses and treats. Start keeping a sleep journal (or use an app on your phone) to log when you sleep, quality of sleep, how you feel the next day, any meds you've taken, etc. A good sleep doc will have you do one anyway so you'll be ahead of the curve when you eventually get in to see someone. There's fancy testing for it but it's usually diagnosed based on history and a detailed sleep journal. \n\nAnd for the record, as someone who has struggled with DSPD since childhood and am now in my mid 30s, I don't think you were the asshole at all in your original post. You could have had a bit more tact, but imo it is 100% okay for you to miss an event (yes, even an important one) if it will cause you physical harm. Because having to wake up in the middle of your night does cause you measurable physical harm (hellooooo immune system) and you will be absolutely miserable all day. Ask your sis if she would think it's reasonable for you to expect her at a 2 am wedding because that's what she's asking you to do.\n\nIt's okay for her to be upset and also okay for you to step back and only attend part of the wedding to accommodate your sleep schedule, but remember that ultimately she chose her wedding schedule KNOWING you have chronic sleep issues and now she's all mad that you won't just make it work for her, not realizing what a huge ask that is for someone with DSPD. It's not like you can just \"go to bed early just this once\" or \"just take a unisom\" because anything short of drugging yourself to oblivion will not work and from experience I can tell you that doing that anyway will really fucking suck.\n\nThe only way I've ever been able to maintain a \"normal\" sleep schedule is by taking multiple sleep aids around 11 pm because that's the earliest I could make it work (all under medical supervision). And even then I can only manage it months at a time, it takes months of careful medication management and self control to reach that earlier bedtime, and even one night of staying up an hour or two later screws me up and I have to start all over from square one. This experience is depressingly common with DSPD. I've been trying to make my peace with it and embrace my natural circadian rhythm because although it makes a lot of things far more challenging (i.e. literally everything you do while awake and much of it must be done during normal business hours, so you only get half the time everyone else does) at least I feel less like garbage during my \"day\". I go to bed between 2-4 am and sleep until noon at least. It's inconvenient for pretty much everyone in my life but you know what? Them expecting me to fight a literal disability that is incredibly difficult to treat in to be less inconvenient is a far shittier thing to do.\n\nBecause for real, DSPD is an actual physical disability. You're not being lazy, you're not procrastinating your sleep, you're not \"not trying hard enough\". A very important life activity (sleep) is being severely impacted by a neurological sleep disorder and unfortunately that affects any activity that happens when the sun is up, like that wedding. Attending the latter part only might be disappointing to sis but imo is a very reasonable accommodation for a DISABILITY, no different than asking for a ramp if you're in a wheelchair.\n\nGood luck to you!", "You'd be surprised how many doctors are like this. I have DSPD, a circadian rhythm disorder that is very much like what OP has described (would not be surprised if they also have it), and it is infuriatingly difficult to find a doctor who will take you seriously. It's almost always \"just go to bed earlier\" or \"get up earlier\" or \"you're just being lazy\" or my personal favorite, the referral for a psych consult. All because I Can't. Fucking. Sleep. At least, not during what's considered \"acceptable\" hours. If left to my own devices I can sleep just fine, it just isn't until 2-4 am.\n\nSleep disorders affect every facet of your life and it's something most people don't think about until they are in a position where they HAVE to think about it, i.e. they are having trouble sleeping. Doctors tend to dismiss these things because they think it's all a matter of self control and if you're staying up too late, well, you just need self control. Except with circadian rhythm disorders it's a physiological difference in how the brain is wired and no amount of self control will fix it. It's like telling someone who is having a panic attack that they just need to calm down. Never in the history of freaking the fuck out has it ever helped to be told \"you just need to calm down\". It's easier for doctors to give simplistic advice like \"follow better sleep hygiene\" or \"here take this pill\" instead of actually trying to find the source of the sleep issue and then work with it instead of against it, since clearly working against it isn't working or that person wouldn't be at the doctor.", "Oh god, OP I just saw the bit about the nutritionist friend. BAD IDEA. BAD, BAD, TERRIBLE IDEA. *Your friend is in no way qualified to help you with your sleep issues.* Abort mission! \n\nNutrition isn't going to fix a sleep disorder or millions fewer of us would have sleep disorders. I would sleep like a fucking baby if it was just a nutrition issue. That's like going to see a dentist for knee surgery. You need an actual sleep specialist who can diagnose what's going on, preferably one who knows about DSPD because you pretty much described my life and I didn't find out about DSPD until my 30s. Was always told it's just insomnia, have always been treated like your family treats you (which is very much not okay btw).\n\nStart with your primary care doctor and ask for a referral to a sleep specialist. Go into that appointment already having done some research into appropriate doctors. In particular, call every sleep specialist your insurance covers and explicitly ask if they diagnose and treat DSPD. You will likely have to hunt for one (and maybe even have to travel a bit to see them) but it's worth it to get the right diagnosis. The treatment for insomnia is very different than the treatment for DSPD. This already affects every single aspect of your life and you owe it to yourself to find the root of the problem instead of having people (like your sister and the nutritionist friend) throw misinformation at you.", "Yes, and I don't know how a nutritionist can help cure DSPD.  OP needs a sleep study.\n\nOP, as.a fellow pack member of your sleep disorder, I wish you all the luck in the world.", "Sounds like the mom was big contributing factor too, possibly a control freak who enjoyed how much control she got to exert over OP as a result of her sleep disorder.", "I got the impression that OP\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t understand healthy eating, and that OP\u2019s sister also suffered poor heath until she moved out.

You've been this way for too long.
