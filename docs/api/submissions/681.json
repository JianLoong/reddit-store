I can see why some teachers/professors would not want their students knowing where they live. \n\nI'm sticking with NTA, because I think you did this with good intentions.", "NTA. It's not as though your dad needs to be friends with this person, I don't see any reason why this should be an issue. You need to be allowed to have a social life. If the main issue is students knowing where you live I hate to break it to your dad, but the internet exists, I would bet that information is pretty readily available."]}
