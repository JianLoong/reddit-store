My boyfriend does display symptoms of autism and it apparently impacts him to the point where he couldn\u2019t get me a gift for our one year anniversary because he got overwhelmed when he went into a card shop and had to leave. But not enough to seek out a diagnosis.\n\nThroughout our relationship, my boyfriend has casually sent me autism memes and openly spoke and joked about \u2018his autism\u2019, However, I reached a breaking point and decided to address the issue head-on.\n\nMy discomfort stems from the fact that, while I genuinely believe he might be on the autism spectrum, he has not pursued formal diagnosis despite scoring 10/10 on the AQ10 test (an autism screening tool used by medical professionals in the UK). His reasoning for avoiding a formal assessment revolves around the lengthy waiting times, with potential delays of up to four years. He holds a letter stating that he is highly suspected to be autistic and should undergo assessment, but he remains hesitant.\n\nDuring our (approximately) hour-long argument, he expressed concerns about occupying a spot on the waitlist that someone he perceives as more affected might need. Yet, much to my annoyance, he has no issue confidently declaring, \"I am autistic\u201d. He brought up the fact that people in third world countries can\u2019t afford a diagnosis, and asked if they\u2019re the exception to my \u201cself-diagnosed people shouldn\u2019t say \u201cI am autistic\u201d\u201d. I said that I feel sorry for them, but I don\u2019t think that they should either.\n\nIn an attempt to find a middle ground, I suggested he use language like \"I have suspected autism,\" but he fears it may lead to not being taken seriously, especially in workplace, where he is part of a disability network that apparently doesn't require proof.\n\nWhat complicates matters further is his best friend's history of self-diagnoses. Initially identifying as autistic, this friend has now transitioned to self-diagnosing with ADHD. I couldn't help but wonder if my boyfriend's strong stance on the validity of self-diagnosis is influenced by this. His own mother even uses words like \u201cADHD\u201d and \u201chyperfocus\u201d for his brother who also has strongly suspected/self diagnosed ADHD, so she\u2019s a believer in self-diagnosis.\n\nThis was our first proper argument, and the aftermath leaves me feeling uncertain about our relationship. I agreed to keep my mouth shut from now on, but he told me that now he\u2019s hesitant to bring up his suspected autism and that he feels like I\u2019m invalidating all of his negative life experiences that he\u2019s gone through because he\u2019s always been \u201cthe odd one out\u201d. He thinks I feel this way because my autism diagnosis came as a shock to me (he said it was \u201chanded to me\u201d), and I admittedly am still somewhat in denial.  \n\nAm I truly projecting here? I apologised and told him that I never want to make him feel invalidated, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1702995682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m303b/aita_for_telling_my_selfdiagnosed_autistic/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What would change if he received a diagnosis? What tools or resources would he receive then that he can\u2019t utilize now?\n\nIf your boyfriend is already doing the work and utilizing tools that typically help those on the spectrum is helping him, then why does a diagnosis matter?\n\nIf he isn\u2019t utilizing those tools already available to him and his using his self diagnosis as an excuse instead of a reason, isn\u2019t that a bigger concern?", "Is it possible this is bothering you because it breaks \u201cthe rules\u201d? As someone who is diagnosed neurodiverse and suspected autistic, for me sometimes I get trapped in the \u201cthis is this, that goes like like.\u201d Trap. It\u2019s the \u201crules\u201d that you see symptoms, get a diagnosis, work to alleviate the issue. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done, even if we know logically that\u2019s not how it\u2019s always done. He\u2019s going out of order and skipping steps. Which, I know for me, I would have to talk my brain off the ledge about that, so to speak.", "YTA, slightly.\n\nIf you strongly believe that he has autism to the point he has a formal referral displays more traits of it than you do, then there's not much point in being critical of him saying he's autistic, at least not in an informal setting like with you or with his family. The only place it'd be appropriate to police his language is in a medical setting or a conversation about legal accommodations, where the diagnosis itself would be relevant.", "Tough one. I am NT so I fear I may lack perspective. I do think people have the capacity to self-diagnose, and you seem to agree that your boyfriend probably has autism. So I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re hung about this. \n\nSo, INFO what exactly is the problem with someone making an honest, informed self-diagnosis? He has to live in his own mind and body, if this makes to him and to you, and he doesnt feel a need for a for al diagnosis, what is wrong with it?", "You are absolutely TA. Your own experience of neurodivergence is not anyone else\u2019s, and you cannot project anything from yourself onto another. There are myriad reasons for not getting a diagnosis, including not being ready to, fear of the process, concern about how having the actual label could change things, and more.\n\nI say this as a now-diagnosed autistic: YTA. I didn\u2019t seek a diagnosis until I was 35. I knew my whole life. But I couldn\u2019t get access to the right doctors for a long time, and before that I was worried of the \u201ceveryone has autism these days\u201d brigade, and before that I thought I was managing just fine without a diagnosis (spoiler: I was not and had a breakdown at 30). Actively seeking a diagnosis is VERY different in process and time than a \u201csurprise\u201d diagnosis like yours, so leave him to do what he wants, at the pace he wants.\n\nETA: as for the disability group at work that \u201cdoesn\u2019t require proof\u201d you need to check your ableism and research more about why people shouldn\u2019t HAVE to disclose their medical history to others for their experience to be valid.", "YTA. You were autistic before you were diagnosed weren't you? The piece of paper doesn't make you officially autistic. \n\nNot everyone can afford a diagnosis. Not everyone wants a formal diagnosis for a number of reasons.  \n\nSelf diagnosis is valid.", "Part of my job is to assess children and teens for autism. Often people come to us absolutely sure they/their children are autistic, and we find that there are other things going on which much better explain their \u201cprofile\u201d (other forms of neurodiversity, mental health diagnoses etc.). Self diagnosis is very problematic: it takes a team of people to formulate an autism diagnosis, usually from different professional backgrounds. The person being diagnosed/their family are one part of that team only.\n\nHaving said that, it\u2019s important to know exactly what it is about your b/f self diagnosing that you find so difficult. Do you feel like it invalidates your struggles? Does it annoy you because you went through the diagnostic process (which can be very difficult)? Does it annoy you because you see autism as part of who you are, and want to protect what that means?\n\nFrom a medical perspective, if your b/f isn\u2019t having any difficulties he can\u2019t be diagnosed, even if he meets other criteria. (A functional impact is part of the diagnostic criteria.) if the reason he is not going for an assessment is that he is not having problems, then technically he is not autistic under current criteria. I would guess  though that he is scared of an assessment revealing that he isn\u2019t autistic, and might be having some problems.\n\nOn the same level, you mentioned that you were diagnosed by a psychiatrist. NICE guidelines say that there should be a multidisciplinary team providing the diagnosis, so your b/f could justifiably challenge your diagnosis on the grounds that it was not \u201cproper \u201c. How would that make you feel?", "Kinda yta for being hung up on this\n\nHis reasoning aside.  Diagnosis or not diagnosis doesnt change whats happening to him\n\nHow is his not being diagnosed affect anyone at all?", "I'm gonna go with NAH, since I do agree that there is merit to your boyfriend getting formally diagnosed, and at the very least he could get his name in the line for that queue, even if does take a long time.\n\nAt the same time, I don't think there's anything wrong with him self-diagnosing, especially since as you said, he's showing all the signs, has what I'm guessing is a formal referral to be tested since it's highly suspected, and you even agree he's more than likely on the autism spectrum. At least as far as for informal settings as some others have pointed out at least, like with friends and family, maybe in a more serious setting like at the doctors' or with the police.", "NAH. I do kind of think you are projecting, and honestly there are times when self-diagnosing can be problematic. But just to offer you another perspective; I have severe medical trauma because I had an incredibly painful and debilitating condition for 11 years and was completely ignored and invalidated by the medical community regarding it. I finally received a diagnosis and treatment but by then it had caused a lot of damage both mentally and physically. I received therapy eventually regarding my experience, but it's definitely left me a little untrusting and gun shy of pursuing issues with my doctors because of my experiences. Just food for thought.", "YTA - You're kind of an asshole. As a (late) diagnosed woman myself, the only reason I had a mere two years on the waiting list was because my local authority was so overwhelmed the government stepped in and paid private psychiatrists to take over the assessments. Getting a diagnosis is not quick, easy, or painless.\n\nI understand where your boyfriend is coming from, once you're an adult diagnosis feels weird. People act like the only value it has is to get you additional support in school. It can also be a very invasive process. I had an in-person interview and a second phone interview. I had pages and pages of questionnaires I had to complete - and an entire set I had to ask a parent to complete about my early years. It can be a lot to ask of yourself, and if you already feel secure in your self-diagnosis (or perhaps have no one willing or able to provide childhood information about you) I can see why you'd just leave it. \n\nYou come across as not wanting other people to be, or refer to themselves as, autistic, as if it's something only you can have any say in or talk about. You are invalidating his experiences, and his understanding of himself, which is cruel as someone who has probably experienced the same from others. It feels as though you use your diagnosis as something to hold over other people. \n\nI also find it very judgemental your comments on \"now so and so has ADHD too\" when actually ADHD and Autism have a lot of overlap. Autism still needs a lot of study and exploration, there's so much we don't understand, and historically these conditions have been considered one and the same at times because of this. I don't know, you approach this whole situation with very little compassion towards your own boyfriend, which contrary to popular belief is not a trait of autism. If you dislike him so much do him the kindness of letting him go. It's not healthy to have any diagnosis be your entire personality.", "YTA. I didn't get diagnosed with OCD until I was in my teens. By which point I'd been suffering with it for most of my life. Getting a diagnosis didn't change a single thing. \n\nI completely understand how irritating it is when people who don't have an illness claim it because it's cool or trendy or they just want attention. But you literally admitted you think he is autistic, so why would a diagnosis change anything? Most autistic people don't get diagnosed. Most autistic people in history have gone without one and that doesn't negate that they have it. If you really want to help him, help him get a diagnosis without putting him down. You're not giving him a reason to want to make it official.\n\nI waited years on a waiting list and when I was finally diagnosed it changed nothing about my life because like autism, OCD has no cure. \n\nYou're annoyed with him because you feel he's using his autism as an excuse for things that you don't. Fine, communicate that with him. You're not really upset about the lack of diagnosis. You seem upset he's using his autism as a punchline and as excuse for certain things he does. In which case he has no reason to stop unless you communicate that you're annoyed.", "YTA. If it\u2019s not important to him, it\u2019s not something he needs to pursue. Having a formal diagnosis can cause issues in other areas, for example several countries, including New Zealand, do not accept immigrants with autism. \n\nSome people are also not emotionally ready. The only way it would be a problem is if he has untreated issues he refuses to address (such as violent outbursts or abusive behaviour) 5) that need immediate treatment.", "YTA You\u2019re not the autism police and why are you surprised that an autistic person is being stubborn? I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist during an exam for a security clearance but have never mentioned it to my doctor because I don\u2019t want it in my medical records. You can\u2019t predict how information will be used. There\u2019s a lot of hostility towards people with autism and it\u2019s stupid to put it on the record if you don\u2019t need medical intervention.", "NTA - I feel like there\u2019s some excessive self diagnosis of disorders nowadays (I\u2019m diagnosed with ADHD so I get where you\u2019re coming from). If someone isn\u2019t a medical professional they can\u2019t diagnose themselves IMO", "It sounds to me like he doesn\u2019t want a formal diagnosis because he\u2019s afraid they will tell him he doesn\u2019t have autism. Then it\u2019s back to the drawing board.", "YTA. It\u2019s almost like you are testing Autism like it\u2019s a trophy. Just because he self diagnosed doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true especially if the symptoms are matching. Also the thing about stuff like Autism when you are adult is a lot of Doctors will legit refuse to actually diagnose you with it since most are kids when they are diagnosed.", "I don't think AH determination is going to help or solve anything here, so instead I'll just leave some related material. This is a good video on the subject of self-diagnosis, and I think it covers the matter pretty well: [https://youtu.be/x4ieMzbXiRA?si=cb64-ylelu8M\\_Jls](https://youtu.be/x4ieMzbXiRA?si=cb64-ylelu8M_Jls)", "YTA but I mean this gently, because OP I relate to you. I was officially \u201con the books\u201d diagnosed autistic a few years back. This came after years of struggling in the mental health system so to find a diagnosis that fit was a relief but also more than that\u2014it felt like I had my life back.\n\nSo I became defensive over the label. I thought self-diagnosis was invalid and unfair because self-diagnosed people didn\u2019t have to suffer to get the label like I did. When my sibling started suspecting they were autistic too, I cried. It sounds so silly to other people, but as an autistic person I tend to get defensive over things I feel are \u201cmine.\u201d This happens with favourite bands, TV shows, etc\u2014and it happened with my diagnosis.\n\nYou are wrong here. Your boyfriend is not doing anything hurtful to you by identifying as autistic. You\u2019re getting upset because there\u2019s no black and white \u201cproof\u201d of an \u201cofficial\u201d diagnosis (for me as someone who needs logic and facts to see something as real, I understand this). Him not getting you a card was wrong on his part, etc, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve considered that if indeed your bf is autistic too, he could struggle with the exact same things you do (like sensory overload).\n\nSometimes self-diagnosis is the only way to go with autism diagnoses. I am exactly like you in that my diagnosis was a surprise and it was also \u201chanded to me\u201d (I think this wording is insensitive on your bf\u2019s part but I understand where he\u2019s coming from in that being diagnosed as an adult is like finding a needle in a haystack, so even though he\u2019s wrong and that I\u2019m sure you had a struggle to get here just like me, you still found the needle).\n\nAlso, it\u2019s just not necessary for all adults to get diagnosed if they already believe they\u2019re autistic with low support needs. I believe in the US (you seem like you\u2019re from the UK but just adding context) this can even harm people since having the diagnosis can limit opportunities (I\u2019m not American so I\u2019m not exactly sure). If he doesn\u2019t need a specific diagnosis to attain accommodations or a place in this group he\u2019s in etc, then it really doesn\u2019t matter. I have not had any formal \u201cbenefits\u201d from having a documented diagnosis because of privacy laws (so if you already had a mental health diagnosis that allows you accommodations, getting the formal diagnosis wouldn\u2019t really matter). A self-diagnosis as an adult can just help someone learn how to accommodate themselves day to day.\n\nI think you\u2019re centring yourself a lot in this conversation which I understand. But you have said yourself that your bf seems autistic (which is why you\u2019re pushing for him to get assessed), so your defensiveness here is misplaced. If your bf\u2019s behaviour is impacting your relationship and you therefore think an official diagnosis would be necessary to make sure you can still function together, that\u2019s a different conversation. But it doesn\u2019t really seem to be (except maybe he needs some resources on how to handle things like sensory overload\u2014check out Instagram accounts for autistic adults, I learned a lot through those).\n\nSelf-diagnosis is I would say, majorly the only way a lot of people can be diagnosed nowadays. Not all countries have the resources you do (so what you said about people in third world countries not self-diagnosing was wrong). Adult women can struggle to get diagnosed (like me). Like I said, autism diagnoses in adults don\u2019t impact much (like in childhood where more support in schools might be set up). What it does is help someone identify how to live more comfortably. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nI know I\u2019m saying all of this now, but a year and a half ago I was still saying self-diagnosis was wrong and people shouldn\u2019t do it. If the self-diagnosis is done responsibly, it\u2019s totally fine and sometimes necessary (because believe it or not, the test I did was tailored for literal children!and I wouldn\u2019t have been diagnosed based off the results alone). My previous stance came from defensiveness over my own personal struggle.\n\nIf your bf doesn\u2019t want to get diagnosed officially, that\u2019s his choice. The lack of formal diagnosis is clearly not impacting his life, and I think it\u2019s noble that he doesn\u2019t want to take up space on a waiting list if he doesn\u2019t have to. His mother using ADHD terms for his brother who is suspected ADHD is fine too if it\u2019s helping them. Right now I think your attitude of needing a diagnosis to be official before accommodating needs is projecting internalized ableism (the idea of going by the book here sort of reflects the ableist systems that make it hard for adults to get diagnosed in the first place).\n\nWishing you all the best, OP! Have an open conversation with your boyfriend and try to see his perspective here. He\u2019s not harming anyone (I\u2019m assuming the memes are like the ones I\u2019ve seen and not ableist). I felt exactly like you and now I find it really comforting to see my family members comfortable with calling themselves autistic after genuinely looking into it themselves.", "NTA. Saying he's autistic without using any qualifiers such as \"suspected\" or \"I think I have\" strongly implies a formal medical diagnosis. So him saying that he has it for sure is akin to a lie and actually offensive to people who have been legitimately diagnosed. If it's so important for him to claim autism, he should pursue a formal diagnosis. If a formal diagnosis isn't something he wants to pursue, he should stop claiming autism.", "YTA\n\nAs another diagnosed autistic, it is excruciatingly difficult to get diagnosed and until they do, it\u2019s okay to look into it as much as possible and identify with the term.", "YTA.\n\nGetting an autism diagnosis has, as I'm sure you know, negative effects. It also has very little positive effects. You've stated that he has autistic traits, that he scored 10/10 on the assessment and has been told to go get assessed by a professional. He has autism. His self diagnosis is valid in this case.\n\nI have ADHD- inattentive but I have NOT gotten a formal diagnosis. What I have done is talked with a psychiatrist to get an unofficial diagnosis and medication to help treat it. My diagnosis is also valid. Getting a formal diagnosis here is expensive and every time I called the couple of places that offer it, I get told they're not accepting new clients. \n\nYou're very hung up on this, and I understand it's probably related to the fact that you have autism, but he has every reason to say he's autistic. Just let him.", "You're The Autist.\n\n I have a psych report saying I'm Autistic.\n\n So what you are doing here in this post is displaying a bucket of autism. Which is fine, it's how you are. Don't feel bad about it. If your bf is an autist dating someone he knows to be an autist then he should be fine to deal with occasional bouts of wild autism.\n\n Whether or not he does or should pursue an assessment depends on a few factors. What is the cost both in terms of effort and money and time. What is to be gained what is to be lost. A cost benefit analysis if you will.\n\n He shouldn't pursue one \"because that is what you do\". And if he truly doesn't want to he doesn't have to.\n\n Having a diagnosis doesn't allow you to now just do anything you feel like doing. Doesn't really change anything honestly, at least for me. I must admit I don't go around with a printed copy of my diagnosis to prove to peeps I'm Autistic. They all say \"you're normal\" which is weird because acting like being abnormal is bad I find insulting. I'm abnormal and I am totally OK with that. \n\n So one thing, you post stories like this in places like this you are going to get called an asshole. Autistic people being who they are get called assholes a lot. Nevermind rhe actually fucked up people .. yknow I'm just going to say we often have traumatic childhoods, we don't as frequently inflict them. I've yet to meet an Autistic person who is wantonly cruel.  \n\n So regarding your bf. Hopefully you can see that while you may feel that things should be nicely and officially categorised whether or not they are doesn't change his lived experience. If someone seems Autistic and acts Autistic and quacks like an autist and is dating an autist.... they are almost certainly Autistic. I got my diagnosis because my then gf who was diagnosed with Autism drove me to do so. While I got to know myself better by looking into it the formal diagnosis has never actually improved.my quality of life.\n\n I ended up realising that long term repeated contact with me and an ability to relate to each other basically predicts whether anyone else I know has autism. I can work it out over time. Anyone who isn't Autistic who I am friends with despite any level of fond feeling there is always a difference. Talking to someone on the spectrum I can often communicate at the speed of light. Talking to others it can take hours of times several times over days or weeks or years to communicate what takes seconds. If you pay enough attention to yourself and those around you and spend enough time around people both on and off the spectrum you'll probably find you can too sooner or later.\n\n Adhd and autism have high co-morbidity. Very high. I actually have adhd too. \n\n Anyway I don't think waiting to be assessed and going through with that is required for him to believe he is Autistic. And if he believes it and behaves accordingly what does it actually matter. He probably is Autistic. Having to be so painfully precise with speech is I think a curse. My ex gf was into painful precision. Eventually she became so anxious she was house bound. I prefer to not tie myself in knots. Compared to a more average person I am highly pedantic. No need to try and become as pedantic as I can possibly be. Nothing is gained from it.", "YTA. hi, i am a \u201csuspected\u201d autistic- as in, multiple people in my life, including my pediatrician growing up, assume i\u2019m on the spectrum. they\u2019re probably correct! and while i would like a formal diagnosis, not only are they expensive, in some places they\u2019re more of a hinderance than a help. i get being frustrated. i do. but this isn\u2019t actually going to help him get diagnosed", "yes you are given how long the wait is to get diagnosed.  particularly if there are \"other\" things as well like add/ adhd/depression etc  and also if somone is high functioning the odds go even further down. \n\nive been on that list for over a decade. and still no closer to being diagnosed formally despite it being a perfect fit \n\n&#x200B;\n\nnot that the NHS is any fucking use for anything at all.", "Autistic person here:\n\nYou mentioned yourself that he shows signs and symptoms of autism that make a diagnosis likely, that he has anxiety that affects him in his day to day life, and that the wait time in your country is very long, and I'm sure it's a very daunting and stressful task to navigate the health care system to even get evaluated. It took me until my 30s to get someone to listen to me. I still can't access an evaluator in my country. I, however, am sure I have autism, my therapist, and PCP agree that I likely have autism, but it's hard as an adult to get a proper evaluation or someone to take you seriously. I am technically \"self diagnosed\" as I don't have an \"official\" diagnosis. Sometimes, getting an evaluation and a diagnosis is a privilege that not everyone is afforded. You're being low-key ableist and gate-keepy. Apologize to your BF and start being more supportive.", "YTA. There are a lot of perfectly valid reasons to never seek a formal diagnosis: for example, some countries won't let people obtain permanent residencies with an autism diagnosis on record. An autistic friend of mine in Australia has concerns [their driver's license may be taken away with a recent ruling](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/103108100). \n\nNot having that formal diagnosis doesn't make the person any less autistic or any less affected by their autism. Why is it so important to YOU that he seeks a diagnosis?", "As a fellow diagnosed autistic woman, I think YTA. While I personally found diagnosis incredibly helpful, since there is no treatment or extra resources made available to autistic adults (at least not in my country), I don't really see what getting a diagnosis here would achieve, if he doesn't want one.\n\nIf you have the time to spare, I would suggest watching Alexander Avila's YouTube video \"TikTok gave me Autism: the Politics of Self-diagnosis\". It is a very thoughtful, informed and nuanced examination of questions of self-diagnosis.", "One of the CORNERSTONES of the autism community is that self diagnosis IS VALID af. Yes YTA.", "YTA he\u2019s hitting at the boxes a psychiatrist is going to tic. It doesn\u2019t sound like he needs intervention, why waste a doctors time? \n\nHaving the official diagnosis wouldn\u2019t change his life. He\u2019s not looking for accommodations or treatments. His self report is accurate enough.", "This is a tough one but I lean towards YTA - though granted I am biased.   \nHere is a story I hope you or others find relatable or helpful:\n\nI (30F) have a friend (31M) who was diagnosed so long ago, he was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome - but in short, he is and has always been diagnosed. I have been struggling to get my diagnosis for years. I am sure you know well about the disparity between male and female patients getting diagnosed, etc., so it was a difficult time finally getting diagnosed after years of being told it was just my PTSD or it was ADHD (even that was tough to get diagnosed).\n\nMy friend, the 31 year old, did not take it well when I initially told him I was even seeking a diagnosis. He told me I was too well adjusted, too social, too *happy*. I tried to explain that my exterior self, my persona, may be very different from what I am experiencing internally - explained about some past events that led me to even look into Autism as a possible diagnosis, the whole she-bang. \n\nThis caused a bit of a riff between us, especially when I *did* get my diagnosis and he doubled-down on his previous sentiments. I know he has serious self-loathing issues, and he often equates any and all negative aspects of himself with autism, which is just frankly untrue. Most of his issues come from having rich, unloving parents....\n\nAll this to say - everyone is having a different experience.

My boyfriend does display symptoms of autism and it apparently impacts him to the point where he couldn\u2019t get me a gift for our one year anniversary because he got overwhelmed when he went into a card shop and had to leave. But not enough to seek out a diagnosis.\n\nThroughout our relationship, my boyfriend has casually sent me autism memes and openly spoke and joked about \u2018his autism\u2019, However, I reached a breaking point and decided to address the issue head-on.\n\nMy discomfort stems from the fact that, while I genuinely believe he might be on the autism spectrum, he has not pursued formal diagnosis despite scoring 10/10 on the AQ10 test (an autism screening tool used by medical professionals in the UK). His reasoning for avoiding a formal assessment revolves around the lengthy waiting times, with potential delays of up to four years. He holds a letter stating that he is highly suspected to be autistic and should undergo assessment, but he remains hesitant.\n\nDuring our (approximately) hour-long argument, he expressed concerns about occupying a spot on the waitlist that someone he perceives as more affected might need. Yet, much to my annoyance, he has no issue confidently declaring, \"I am autistic\u201d. He brought up the fact that people in third world countries can\u2019t afford a diagnosis, and asked if they\u2019re the exception to my \u201cself-diagnosed people shouldn\u2019t say \u201cI am autistic\u201d. I said that I feel sorry for them, but I don\u2019t think that they should either.\n\nIn an attempt to find a middle ground, I suggested he use language like \"I have suspected autism,\" but he fears it may lead to not being taken seriously, especially in workplace, where he is part of a disability network that apparently doesn't require proof.\n\nWhat complicates matters further is his best friend's history of self-diagnoses. Initially identifying as autistic, this friend has now transitioned to self-diagnosing with ADHD. I couldn't help but wonder if my boyfriend's strong stance on the validity of self-diagnosis is influenced by this. His own mother even uses words like \u201cADHD\u201d and \u201chyperfocus\u201d for his brother who also has strongly suspected/self diagnosed ADHD, so she\u2019s a believer in self-diagnosis.\n\nThis was our first proper argument, and the aftermath leaves me feeling uncertain about our relationship. I agreed to keep my mouth shut from now on, but he told me that now he\u2019s hesitant to bring up his suspected autism and that he feels like I\u2019m invalidating all of his negative life experiences that he\u2019s gone through because he\u2019s always been \u201cthe odd one out\u201d. He thinks I feel this way because my autism diagnosis came as a shock to me (he said it was \u201chanded to me\u201d), and I admittedly am still somewhat in denial.  \n\nAm I truly projecting here? I apologised and told him that I never want to make him feel invalidated, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It wasn't until I was 29 (now 30) that I was reading some stories of ADHD and how it affects life and I was like \"huh that is like  some of what I struggle with\" and I went to ask my mom if I could get help going to a doctor to see it that she revealed I had already been diagnosed with it in past, that she hid it from me so I \"wouldn't use it as a crutch like many do.\" Lemme tell you that changed my whole world finding out my whole life I've had this and not known. Anxiety was easy to tell, I would litterally have panic attacks and struggle with going to doctors and such alone. I fidget so much in public settings. Depression went the same way as anxiety, easy to tell.   \n\n\nI think autism is also one of those things you can actually figure out on your own for a lot of cases, though obviously an actual diagnosis can get you the proper help you need medically if it ever was needed. However, most neurodivergency is all about learning about your coping mechanisms and what works for you. Sometimes, a lot of times, a full blown diagnosis isn't even needed to learn to deal with it. Sometimes, being diagnosed with something officially is worse for the person then just figuring out your own coping mechanisms.  \n\n\nYou've said in your comments the only way this really actually affects you is basically that you are a rule follower and it basically isn't morally right to you that he doesn't label it \"suspected autism.\" I hate to break it to you, there is no rules on the right way to deal with  neurodivergency.

You would think someone who also had autism would very much be supportive instead of dismissive of it. Instead, you are offended that he's not putting the word \"suspected\" infront of it...  \n\n\nBut I don't think you are neccesarily an AH either.   \n\n\nI think it's a matter of simply your own diagnosis came about in a different way, and thus you have a different view on it. It is hard to accept sometimes when someone is saying they struggle with the same things you do, but have no official diagnosis or confirmations that it's even true, so sometimes it can feel more like mocking.   \n\n\nBut reality is, the world the way it is...with technology and more and more information being accessable...it is getting easier and easier for people to self-diagnose a multiple of things.

On the other hand, I and your bf had to go out looking for answers when I realized I wasn\u2019t like other ppl.

Who knows?\n\nI think he should go forward with diagnosis, but I\u2019m not sure how long waitlists in your country work so maybe his reasoning is fully valid and he\u2019s doing the right thing. Either way, your reasoning falls flat. What exactly are you in denial of? Your own diagnosis?

It's not what I see. \n\n People with autism so far as I can tell prefer to often have a life with less moving parts they don't control. They use a variety of methods to achieve this goal. Sometimes this means putting a lot of emphasis on categories being precisely labelled in the (mistaken in my opinion) belief this helps. Personally I like to categorise things in a more general way. (Still probably seen as precise to others perhaps , I don't know).\n\n So our OP wants to categorise things in a way that suits her because for want of a better term it \"makes her feel better\". I don't know that this is best described as rigid thinking. While Autistic people don't tend to shy away from being openly stubborn and like anyone can be rigid of thought or very stubborn I don't know that I believe we are as a group any more stubborn than non Autistic people.\n\n From my perspective non Autistic people are often violently rigid. You either adhere to their arbitrary unspoken rules or you will suffer. No bend or chill. If you want bend or chill from people then you have to obey more obscure unspoken rules to earn the right to be cut some slack. From where I am sitting that is a rigid system. To a lot of people it's just how things are and they interact with this system without blinking or even realising it's there. \n\n When you're on the spectrum you are ultimately less relatable to people who aren't. And you are outnumbered. And so people who to me seem very rigid will punish you for not adhering to their rigid expectations. Somehow that these expectations are unspoken and inconsistent makes people think they aren't rigid. I obviously beg to differ. \n\n I don't know how rigid OP really is because I haven't spoken to them. I don't think they're being an asshole even if the sub does. Whether or not they are truly being inflexible of thought, for me at least, comes down to can new information get in there. Can they bend. Can they accept that while it might be convenient or it might feel nice to categorise their bf in a specific way that it's not the only option. And it's not really the most practical one. If they stick to their guns and won't flex then I'd label them rigid. \n\n Sorry.

It\u2019s a privilege for that diagnosis to not be used against you, I think it\u2019s critical to remember that. Official diagnoses don\u2019t really impact low-needs autistic adults (I say as one).
