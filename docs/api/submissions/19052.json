My mom married my dad and left her hometown but most of her family still live there. \n\nMy cousin West (19m) goes to college like 40 minutes from home, so he still stays there at his parents\u2019. He has a girlfriend Elena (20f). Elena has a Canadian mom and speaks French. She has a regular babysitting job with one family, the Jones. \n\nA couple weeks after I arrived, Elena asked me if I could babysit for the Jones as she has a family emergency. She told me the rate, which was quite good, and that the kids (10 and 8) were not nightmarish, so I accepted. It was to be from 6 - 11 pm. I went to the Jones\u2019 place and they acknowledged that I came with Elena\u2019s recommendation, and after the usual last minute check the parents left.\n\nI actually had an easy night. The 8 years old was tired from playing with friends all day and went to sleep early while the 10 years old was engrossed in  her new book and pretty much read until her bedtime. The parents came back on time, thank me, said they would wire the money to Elena and I could get my money from her.\n\nWhen I saw Elena the day after, she showed me the amount wired to her and the same amount in cash she had withdrawn to give me. The amount was lower than what Elena told me, by $10 per hour. I said that wasn\u2019t the rate she and I agreed upon. Elena said her rate is good because she speaks French with the kids, so Mr. and Mrs. Jones were willing to pay more. They claimed that I didn\u2019t speak French with the kids, so that\u2019s the rate for me.\n\nI told Elena I don\u2019t care for the explanation but I want the amount of money she promised me when she begged me to help her out. Elena said she can\u2019t make the Jones pay me more and I said I don\u2019t mind if the money comes from her own pocket but I will have the amount I was promised when I took the job.\n\nWest ended up paying me the $50 difference on top of the cash Elena gave me, but he called me TA for forcing his girlfriend to pay.

That's just a direct quote from OP.", "INFO: did the parents ask her to have a bilingual substitute?\n\nI\u2019ve been the parent who wanted to pay less in a similar situation when my babysitter begged me to let her husband substitute for her, but in my case the babysitter had a masters in early childhood development and years of experience while her husband *didn\u2019t feed my son* before trying to rock him to sleep *for four hours.* I didn\u2019t find out how badly he messed up until after I had paid him, and I was so gobsmacked I couldn\u2019t speak. I simply told her he was not an acceptable substitute ever again, and she needed to give me more notice so I could find someone else or provide someone with basic childcare experience. She was mortified, but didn\u2019t offer me a refund or discount on future service. If I hadn\u2019t had so much trouble getting sitters I would have let her go completely over that.\n\nAs a parent, when my sitter offers a replacement, I expect someone with similar competence, or an explanation of any differences. I expect them to understand autistic children, be able to handle pet fur/allergies on their part, and have a basic handle on what gluten is or take instructions so they don\u2019t contaminate my whole kitchen. In exchange I will pay them whatever I paid my sitter to start. I give raises over time for service, like 10% on the first year. Only two sitters have ever made it that far. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth reaching out to the parents since you don\u2019t live in the area. You got your money this time.

It would be petty to cause trouble for Elena when I assure you Elena learned from West paying $50 to you not to make this mistake again when referring people to sub for her.", "Typical french-Canadian elitism.", "NTA, however I'm not certain anyone else is truly an a\\*hole here either. Organizing babysitting like this usually isn't too \"official\"... It's quite likely Elena just assumed they would pay you the same amount. It probably wasn't mentioned to the parents either. To them a stranger was watching their kids who didn't have the same 'qualifications' (french , apparently) and they probably expected to pay less because of that with no idea she'd already told you how much she gets. I wouldn't be surprised if Elena even asked them for you why you weren't sent the expected amount and was told it was because of you not speaking French, if she only mentioned the French-bit as explanation afterward.\n\nThis just seems like a big misunderstanding from lack of proper communication. You're NTA, but if what I described above is true at all I get why Elena/West are a bit annoyed if they were just trying to be helpful to the family- and to you- and ended up losing money over it. If it was me I probably wouldn't have demanded my cousin/his gf pay me, but I tend to be more on the passive, assume-the-best-of-people-side/assume-it's-a-genuine-mistake side. I also wouldn't use her as the intermediary for transactions in the future though.", "NTA The parents are the assholes.", "NTA, chad move", "NTA. She probably gave you the price they pay you without asking the parents first or taking into account that they pay her more for probably a multitude of reasons.

It\u2019s not weird. \n\nEither Elena forgot she was getting the extra or she purposefully misled OP but either way, OP covered for someone based on a specific rate. If there\u2019s a change, it has to be discussed in advance or covered by the person who screwed up. If it helps, Elena can think of it as an emergency coverage fee or job security fee. \n\nIt could also all have been avoided by OP doing the correct thing by discussing rates and taking payment directly from the family. And refusing the work if she wasn\u2019t okay with the rate. At which point the family probably would have paid the extra not to cancel plans tbh. \n\nSo in that sense, because they both sort of screwed up even though OP less so, and also because it\u2019s her family member\u2019s SO, it wouldn\u2019t be a terrible idea to split the difference with Elena.", "The parents for sure but Elena tried to make OP eat it instead of paying the difference. OP didn't agree to a lessor amount.", "The only explanation I can really think is they are completely digital and Op doesn\u2019t have a digital wallet like many of us. So they paid Elena since they are already setup with her. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Elena did get paid the full amount and just told them to send Ops separately.", "Yeah I assumed not from how it was written and what happened (emergency, paying Elena)", "But she talks to Wes in French!", "How would it be the parents taking advantage though? It sounds like money wasn't even discussed between OP and them. I suspect, based on OP's retelling of events, that Elena was the one who got things sorted and wages settled with the parents and then just sent OP in the night of to do the babysitting. Clearly she was acting as a liaison between them in some way since they sent the payment to Elena at the end, instead of paying OP directly. They most likely assumed Elena had quoted her the correct price and then paid accordingly.\n\nElena is the one who pulled the bait and switch on OP, promising them one pay rate and then not following through on it. Whether that was done one purpose or by accident we don't know; maybe she thought OP would say no at the lower rate, maybe it genuinely slipped her mind that her rate was inflated due to her knowing french and didn't realize until the parents paid, maybe she just likes drama and wanted to see what would happen. It doesn't really matter though, she made the deal with OP, not the parents, so it's on her to uphold her word.", "*omelette du fromage*", "Exactly.

Again, they recruited them to fill their spots are responsible for this. She advertised position to fill in as a favor, and the rate.

Elena shares blame here (and honestly depending on the severity of the emergency it's entirely reasonable that she wasn't able to go through several rounds of back-and-forth arranging everything, even finding and proposing a backup at all is doing her employers a favor, though they likely view it as an obligation) for assuming it'd be the same rate & advertising that to OP without confirming first, but I definitely put more of it on the family for paying a lesser rate without being explicit and up front about it and just assuming OP would be fine with it (or not be fine with it but feel she didn't really have any recourse).\n\n>New unknown less skilled sitter is totally okay to be paid less.\n\nAnd an emergency backup sitter arriving on short notice and commuting 40 minutes  each way can get more.

In a \"real job\" in most jurisdictions. Elena would have even had pto, sick leave, etc she could potentially have used.  Helping them find an alternate on short notice is doing them a favor.\n\n>And I'm sure they discussed the rate with a person who made a deal.\n\nIf they did, then sure, 100% Elena's fault because she was intentionally misleading OP. That seems like an odd assumption to make, though. It's unclear if OP would've even refused to take the job at the actual rate if she'd known it ahead of time, or if Elena really had nobody else she could ask, or if the Joneses were even insisting she find coverage herself, so it seems odd she'd burn a bridge and cause family drama for her bf for no real reason. Especially since that ended up with her (or her bf? unclear if he actually paid or just gave Elena's money to OP) on the hook for $50.\n\nIt seems more likely to me that the family didn't discuss OP's compensation with Elena at all until they sent the money, didn't know Elena had already advertised her normal rate, and figured they could get away with paying a 17 year old the \"alternate\" rate and she wouldn't know any different (using the \"she doesn't speak French\" excuse when Elena questioned why the payment was lower than normal). Elena could have certainly pushed harder at that point but her employer was putting her in a really awkward and shitty position (why was she made the middleman for the payment, anyway? Even if they forget to get cash the night of for OP doesn't everyone with a phone have multiple of venmo/cashapp/paypal/zelle/etc these days?) so it's frankly understandable that she didn't feel comfortable and preferred to just make it up out of pocket.\n\nBut when they decided to decrease it without talking to OP they became the asshole here.\n\nalso I guess West is TA too for getting mad at his cousin for asking for money owed to her by his gf's cheapskate bosses, though it certainly wasn't money *he* owed to her so if he's the one who paid it even that is understandable though not particularly fair.", "voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir?"]}
