My mom married my dad and left her hometown but most of her family still live there. \n\nMy cousin West (19m) goes to college like 40 minutes from home, so he still stays there at his parents\u2019. He has a girlfriend Elena (20f). Elena has a Canadian mom and speaks French. She has a regular babysitting job with one family, the Jones. \n\nA couple weeks after I arrived, Elena asked me if I could babysit for the Jones as she has a family emergency. She told me the rate, which was quite good, and that the kids (10 and 8) were not nightmarish, so I accepted. It was to be from 6 - 11 pm. I went to the Jones\u2019 place and they acknowledged that I came with Elena\u2019s recommendation, and after the usual last minute check the parents left.\n\nI actually had an easy night. The 8 years old was tired from playing with friends all day and went to sleep early while the 10 years old was engrossed in  her new book and pretty much read until her bedtime. The parents came back on time, thank me, said they would wire the money to Elena and I could get my money from her.\n\nWhen I saw Elena the day after, she showed me the amount wired to her and the same amount in cash she had withdrawn to give me. The amount was lower than what Elena told me, by $10 per hour. I said that wasn\u2019t the rate she and I agreed upon. Elena said her rate is good because she speaks French with the kids, so Mr. and Mrs. Jones were willing to pay more. They claimed that I didn\u2019t speak French with the kids, so that\u2019s the rate for me.\n\nI told Elena I don\u2019t care for the explanation but I want the amount of money she promised me when she begged me to help her out. Elena said she can\u2019t make the Jones pay me more and I said I don\u2019t mind if the money comes from her own pocket but I will have the amount I was promised when I took the job.\n\nWest ended up paying me the $50 difference on top of the cash Elena gave me, but he called me TA for forcing his girlfriend to pay.

There was no stipulation about speaking French when you took the job. Wow. That's ballsy.\n\nGlad you stuck to your guns.  I'm a little surprised that West was totally fine with Elena's attempt to  take advantage of you.", "NTA. If the rate changed you should've been advised before the work started. It's not your fault you weren't advised that it was $10 extra for speaking French. It sucks that it had to come out of Elena's bf's pocket, but she promised the rate, and she was the one who ultimately paid you for the work.", "NTA, it sucks that you were told one thing and got paid less than you were expecting. If you not speaking French was an issue, it should\u2019ve been told to you beforehand. And since Elena was so desperate and you helped her out, she should absolutely pay what she told you the price was.", "honestly its on the family for deciding to give themselves a discount on the babysitting for, no real reason she should be upset with them not you  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. The parents are the worst assholes for cheating out on babysitting after not making sure you knew their \u201cspeak French\u201d stipulations.\n\nNext time confirm the rate with the family before starting. They suck for lowering it. West sucks for calling you an asshole. Elena sucks for telling you the wrong rate and not pointing it out to the parents when they stiffed you.", "NTA\n\nthat's not even a valid reason to pay less? Because you didn't...speak french?! No, you were told a certain amount and you agreed, you were not given that amount and have every right to be upset!", "Absolutely NTA, you two agreed on a price. Stipulations of you not speaking French I\u2019m sure was never mentioned.", "NTA \n\nYour contract may only have been verbal, but it was to conduct babysitting duties for a given time for a given rate.\n\nBasically, she subcontracted to you. Your contract was with her, not the parents. If they paid her less (did they??)    then that has to be her problem.", "NTA. \n\nYour issue is with the parents. You shouldn't have relied on someone else to accept payment. You should have confirmed with the parents what the rate is. The parents should pay you directly. You could still reach out to the parents. Either the parents are jerks or your friend might be taking out a little bit of profit for being the middleman. Reach out to the parents and ask if they were satisfied with your services. Ask them if they do really pay that premium for speaking French or not.", "NTA\n\nThat family gave the money for the babysitting to your cousin's girlfriend and she decided to keep some of the money for herself.  I highly doubt they said anything about language.  If it was a concern, they would have asked on the front end.\n\nThey probably were more than satisfied, wired Elana the money...and because it's her gig, Elana decided for herself that she should get a finders fee...so she came up with an excuse she thought you would buy\n\nAnd then involved her boyfriend in her deception\n\nMY advice?\n\nDo nothing.  I bet the parents of the 2 kids will one day ask you babysit again when Elana is not available.  If that happens, ask them about the French Language requirement Elana mentioned.  Don't mention the short payment.  Just say \"Elana told me you only wanted babysitters that could speak French and English.  I though I was just a one time emergency option\"\n\nTHen...let things happen the way they happen", "NTA", "NTA-  And I'd tell West that if holding people to their word makes me an AH, I'll own it all day long.. but if we're calling people names bases on what they do...what do we call somebody who makes a deal and then tries to get out of it later after services are rendered?  Thief? Fraud? We could go on...", "NTA\n\nThat's the price she gave you.", "NTA however I think you could\u2019ve talked to the parents to see if this was true or find out if she took some money for being the middleman", "NTA. \n\nElana played the intermediary, and so it is on her to settle the terms correctly. If the Jones said they would pay you less, she should have communicated that to you, and if only after the fact they said that to her, then she should have clarified with them that SHE quoted you her rate and so that is what was expected. \n\nWhoever was wrong in this situation, it wasn't you, and you didn't need to just accept the lower rate. You gave her the choice of either giving you money, or going back to the Jones family and saying there was a mistake made. Good for you for standing up for yourself!", "NTA Never again cover for Elana. I never met a French Canadian I liked.", "NTA for expecting to be paid the agreed amount. YTA for making Elena/West pay it. Your issue is with the ppl you did the work for, you could have taken it up with them before making it an issue with Elena. She showed you what they paid and gave you the full amount so it wasn\u2019t like she made a comission on it.", "YTA. It's not Elena's responsibility to pay you, if you had an issue with the amount, why didn't you contact the Jones family?? They are the people you were working for, not Elena. \n\nYou need to take responsibility for yourself. If you're taking a job, YOU speak to those people about the wedge and you absolutely do not have a middle man take the money, you give them your details to make payment directly to you.", "ESH, she shouldn't have to pay you out of her own pocket but the parents shouldn't have paid you less either. And you should have at least spoken with them to confirm the price.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
