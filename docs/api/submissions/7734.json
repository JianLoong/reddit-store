You and your sister sound like you get excessively angry on little provocation. Maybe your mother is like that as well? Can't you be a bit kinder to each other even if you dont share the same opinion about something?", "Info : how did that even come up though? \n\nYou have EVERY right to talk about whatever she did or say, so she doesnt get to be mad, but im wondering about the sis. Her husband left, she is hurt, her mother is adding on that, what made you decide now to talk to her about that, and never before ? Why werent you just there for her instead of making it about you?"]}
