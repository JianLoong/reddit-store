{"id": 34639, "submission_id": "19227em", "title": "AITA for calling my husband selfish for not wanting to go on vacation with us.", "selftext": "Background:\n\nI (37f) and husband (37m) have been married for 10 years and have 3 children. Every summer, my family takes a vacation to the beach. I'm not a huge beach fan, but our kids LOVE it, plus my mom pays for me and my siblings and our families, so it's almost a free trip (excluding travel there, which usually isn't a huge cost). Some years only some of my family makes it, but a few years ago my entire family (50+ people) went as a last trip with my grandma. Husband HATES the beach, but reluctantly went with us. \n\nHis behavior was HORRENDOUS. He wouldn't leave the condo, bailed on previously booked activities that made the cost go up for others, and didn't help AT ALL with our kids. It was basically like he wasn't there, and when he was, he was complaining the whole time. I was so embarrassed. My whole family gave me the pitying stares the whole time and tried to help me as best they could, but it was just a miserable time. Our daughters begged him to play on the beach with them and he just wouldn't engage at all.\n\nSince then, he hasn't accompanied us back. In fact, he will only go on vacations with us if it is a place of his choosing. Which is usually hiking. Don't get me wrong, I like to hike, but I'd also like to do other things. And so would the kids.\n\nNow on to the part where I called him selfish.\n\nWe are now planning our trip for this summer to the beach, and once again, he says he will not go. The kids are devastated again, because they want him to go so they can swim together and build sandcastles together. He says he just hates the beach and there's no changing his mind.\n\nI got frustrated and called him selfish because he never wants to do anything that the kids enjoy. He said I was being a jerk and there's nothing I can do that will make him like the beach. I told him it's not about liking the beach, it's about spending time with his family. He says we could skip it and go hiking instead if we want to spend time together. So I said we won't be going on anymore of his vacations.\n\nNow I feel guilty, since that was the one thing he would do with us. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm not going to deny my kids the yearly beach vacation. They look forward to it all year long. But they are quite literally the only ones there without their dad present, and they've noticed.\n\nEDIT 2: My whole extended family does not go every year. We don't spend the entire time together. There is plenty of downtime and time to be alone. I have suggested new places before and been vetoed. His family has also wanted to do a beach trip (they love the beach) but he refuses. Also, he has no trauma. He just hates the heat and sand and says it's boring.

Is he 5? The point of the trip is to make memories and its going to happen whether he likes it or not. Unfortunately for him, he is nailing in the memory for his kids as they grow up that he does not value them and actually doesn't really consider family time important if it doesn't involve something he directly chose. \n\nKids *will* remember who was there and built those memories. I agree he's being selfish but I'd also take on a whiney child. I also don't enjoy the beach, but my family also has a similar trip and I just man the items while everyone swims. He has to find the joy in it - one being that his family is there and that should matter.", "NTA\n\nI'm so curious about whole ass adults (with children!) who, apparently, never got the \"sometimes you have to do things that you don't like and be a good sport about it\" lesson growing up.\n\nHe sounds like a child, I'm sorry for those kids that he refuses to try and suck it up every so often for them. My dad was like that, put me in a weird mindset where I decided what I liked wasn't worth anything if everyone else wasn't on board. Needed to do lots of therapy to figure that out.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being incredibly unreasonable. I have a very light skin and burn super easily even in north/wester Europe (IF the sun is out, lol). I've avoided the sun since I got really bad sunburn as a teen, but I have grown to manage to deal with time in the sun and even enjoy it, because friends want to hang out outside in the summer as well as my extended family with small kids.\n\nWhy does he hate the beach? Is it the sun? Is it the sand? Is it crowded beaches? Is it the water?\n\nI think he's being totally selfish by not acquiescing to a paid-for family holiday that you and the kids LOVE, that your extended family love having you all be part of. His behaviour is that of a child. The fact he kept whining, didn't do any of the childcare for his own kids etc just so he could mope more is unacceptable.\n\nHe's behaving in an obnoxious way hoping you'll let him stay home next time. You could \"give him that\", but then I'd refuse to go on any of the trips he suggests. Good for him he likes hiking, he can do that by himself if he arranges child care, because you won't be taking full responsibility for the kids so he can go on a hike. Maybe he can take the kids hiking? But this is just perpetuating his rotten attitude.\n\nI don't know what you can do to make him act like a sociable person. If he's been specific about WHY he doesn't like the beach, you could try to cater to that/he could figure out ways to deal with that. I ALWAYS wear a big sunhat, factor 50 sun screen, sun glasses, long sleeves and long legs because I know that otherwise I will get a sunburn if I'm out in the sun for more than 30 minutes or so. This doesn't stop me from enjoying my time out at the beach, though, because I can still go swimming, play with kids and dogs, sit in the shade and be social. I don't know why your husband can't do the same...\n\nHow long is this holiday? Is this a week or less, or are we talking several weeks every year?", "Adding to this. I'm not going to deny my kids the yearly beach vacation. They look forward to it all year long. But they are quite literally the only ones there without their dad present, and they've noticed.", "NTA\nI don\u2019t like peppa pig but I put up with the whingey little twerp!\nI really don\u2019t like playing Barbie\u2019s but I sure as hell put on the stupid voices and played Barbies dream house\nI don\u2019t like football and I hate wet muddy fields at 9am on a Sunday morning but I stood there in the pissing rain and cheered my kid on!\nYou do things you don\u2019t like because that\u2019s what being a parent is!!\nKeep being a top mum and let your kids grow up with no good memories of dad doing things they like with them because he is indeed a selfish pillock", "NTA.\n\nMy mother doesn\u2019t ride roller coasters. She gets motion sickness even from driving down a hill too fast, never mind coasters. But my brother and I loved them. Most summers we would go to a theme park on our family vacation. My dad would take us on the rides and my mom would sit and people watch or bring a book. When I was a teenager, I would ask, isn\u2019t this boring for you? Wouldn\u2019t you rather be doing something you enjoy? But she would say something along the lines of, summer vacations are for making fun memories for my kids, not for me to do only what I want to do.\n\nMy mom is older and from a different school of thought that expected a full sacrifice of selfhood from parents, so I\u2019m not necessarily saying that this is the model everyone should be following. What I am saying is that it\u2019s extremely immature and obnoxious for your husband to behave the way he has on the previous trips and refuse to go on any others, even when his kids are craving his attention and involvement. Parenting is sacrifice, and one of those sacrifices is that family vacations aren\u2019t just about you anymore. \n\nI have wonderful memories with my mom from our vacations and I remember almost nothing about riding the actual rides. The love I felt from my parents is what always rose to the top.", "NTA,\n\nI HATE the beach, I would much rather be up in the mountains. But my kids love the beach, so summer is beach, winter is the mountains. It\u2019s called compromising. He could even say he go every other year\n\n\nHis kids are going to remember him not wanting to do what they want, but they are forced to do what he wants.", "NTA. Having kids means you have to compromise and do things you wouldn't normally do for their sake. They are young only once, so he needs to take every opportunity he can to bond with them and make their childhood better.", "NTA. He won't go on vacation with you and his children unless it's what HE wants to do? What a baby.\n\nI get not liking the beach. But it's not about the beach. It's about making memories with you and your kids. If he were able to get his head out of his ass long enough, he would be able to figure out how to enjoy being with you guys even if the location isn't HIS choice. He is absolutely being selfish.\n\nETA: It would be one thing if he was willing to work with you to plan a different kind of vacation. But it sounds like he isn't willing to even try anything that isn't hiking. That's not cool.", "NTA - He is obviously behaving like an AH, but I\u2019m curious what his perspective here is? Is there anything more than just him hating the beach?", "NTA. I was 32 years old when I learned my parents hated the beach and all those years of going to the shore was to be with family and because of my sister and I. \n\nThat's what good parents do.", "I agree that the beach sucks. It\u2019s sandy and gross. \n\nBut the kids like it. So dude needs to get over himself and be a dad.  \n\nNTA", "My dad was like your husband. He only wanted to do what he wanted to do. When we were really little, he took us with him. We aged a little and began enjoying different things. I do not have lovely father/daughter childhood memories. I remember times I\u2019d look to see him and realize he\u2019d left - bored. If mom pushed him, he\u2019d come, but he would pout like a toddler. Honestly, that\u2019s not fair to toddlers. I can distract a toddler and keep them happy. Anyway\u2026\n\nNTA - but do not push him to go with you. I\u2019ve been the child with a pouting grown man. It is embarrassing. It makes you feel like you\u2019re the bad kid aggravating dad. Leave him at home. You can wish all day that he could just suck it up and enjoy the kids regardless of where they are, but that\u2019s just not the man you married. You married a boring homebody that likes to wander through the woods. \n\nYour choices - \n1.  Go to the beach without him and make the best of it. \n2. Only go places he wants to go.", "NTA - That is part of being a dad (or any parent) doing some stuff that you personally don't enjoy in order to support your kids and make memories with them. I mean, I didn't find a lot of enjoyment in helping with homework, or sitting in a parking lot waiting for after school pick up, etc. Selfish is a pretty accurate response. I would never pick a beach vacation because I don't enjoy them either, but if that is what the whole family is doing, that is what you do. \n\nAnd he really needs to no hide out with an attitude the entire trip. I just don't get folks who just decide to be miserable. People have some pretty difficult lives to be pouting inside in a corner away from everyone because they don't like the beach.", "NTA\u2026 but maybe neither is he\u2026\nHe went one year, made everyone miserable because he can\u2019t maintain in that environment and so now he opts not to go. \nI feel bad that your kids want him to enjoy those things but he doesn\u2019t. \n\nMy own husband loves riding dirt bikes and camping. I flipping hate it. No, hate is too soft a word. He pushes me to go with him and the kids. If I finally give in I\u2019m miserable the whole time and can only wear my \u201cthis is a good time\u201d mask so long\u2026 about 2 hours is as long as I can make it without getting pissed off that I\u2019m absolutely filthy and I\u2019m getting drained by mosquitos despite the incredible amount of repellant I continuously apply. \nThen he gets frustrated that im a jerk. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. \n\nI don\u2019t know how your husband\u2019s relationship with your family is, but if I were to go on a trip to somewhere I hate and then throw in my in laws, I\u2019d lose my mind even more. I love my in laws but the pressure to maintain my composure would be that much greater. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster. \n\nI suggest not pressing him to go on the beach trip. Go with your kids and your folks. Have a great time. Then If you don\u2019t want to go hiking for him, don\u2019t. If he asks why, tell him you don\u2019t enjoy it. If he doesn\u2019t have to visit the beach for you, you don\u2019t have to traipse through poison oak for him.", "NTA, you don't have 3 children, you actually have 4.", "NTA, he is selfish and childish and he ruined your last vaction just to make a point.If you would be like him and woudnt like hiking ....then you woudnt have any family vacations.", "NTA. The mature thing to do would be to compromise on a vacation you both enjoy, but I\u2019m siding with you over your husband for your kids\u2019 sake. It sounds like this is one vacation a year, the kids want the beach, and want their dad at the beach, so he should suck it up and do the beach.\n\nWhen I was about 8 I asked my mom if we could go to a water park/amusement park. She doesn\u2019t like roller coasters, being wet, or getting her carefully arranged hair ruined. But she took me to the park. We had a great day and I vividly remember her returning looking like a drowned rat. My grandfather came to every one of my ballet performances, twice a year for 13 years. He didn\u2019t do this out of some great love for the ballet. My aunt played softball with her sons regularly and she has never enjoyed sports of any kind. Sometimes as a parent you engage in stuff that isn\u2019t your favorite for your kids. \n\nYour husband is a sad sack and a child. He couldn\u2019t even muster the bare minimum of politeness for your family and spend a little time in the sand when the kids begged him and yet he\u2019s saying YOU are the a-hole for not just doing scrapping something the kids have been looking forward to all year and doing the only thing he\u2019s willing to do.\n\nIs there something actually likable about this man that makes you want to be around him? I\u2019m not seeing it.", "NTA! Go to the beach and have a fantastic time. Maybe you will meet a nice guy who likes the beach, likes you, and likes your kids-- because it sure doesn't sound like you have that now.", "NTA, what kind of a parent doesn\u2019t want to engage with his kids on vacation? Then he can take them hiking and have a week away with them and you can take them to the beach.\n\nWelcome to parenting 101, it\u2019s not all about you.", "NTA. Your husband seems to be too nonchalant about how his kids would feel. I mean, it may be repetitive summer activity but engaging with his kids or otherwise leave a mark on them. He's ruining his relationship with other family members and you, too.", "I do things with my kids that aren\u2019t my cup of tea, but it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about my kids know that I will spend time with them any way I can.", "NTA you\u2019re right, he\u2019s selfish.  He can\u2019t stomach a nearly free vacay that his kids love because it\u2019s not what he likes?  No compromise of this year we do beach next year Disneyland or whatever but only hiking which kids don\u2019t typically like?", "I\u2019m appalled by his behavior on that last beach trip. Is\u2026 is he like that at home? How could he possibly feel okay about acting like a giant toddler? \n\nHonestly, selfish is the least I\u2019d be calling him with this behavior. Holy cow. NTA", "I hate the beach. Hate it. I get sunburned really easily, and I feel constantly dirty, and I always end up dehydrated and covered in bug bites. And I don\u2019t have kids. But I have nieces and nephews, and they love the beach, so I go. They\u2019re not my kids. But they ask me to, and so at least every couple of years, I suck it up and go. NTA, and I\u2019d insist on marriage counseling over this. Not because you disagree about vacations, but because his reaction to that disagreement is to refuse to parent his own kids.", "He's an AH. I've seen this behavior in my Ex and friends/families relationships (from men and women). He's doing it to punish you. He wants to ruin the trip for you with his behavior. The hiking-trips only? That's not a relaxing trip with kids; bet doesn't help with the kids much on those trips either.", " Nta. \n\nI had a friend with a husband like this.  She would suggest a day at the children\u2019s museum with the kids and he would say how it wasn\u2019t fun for him and refuse to go.  If he did agree to go, he would pout and be withdrawn with a little boy tantrum mad face.  She eventually got fed up and left him.  She is remarried to a new guy and he loves her and wants to help and is a great partner.  She is so much happier now.   \n\nYour husband thinks more of himself & his own happiness.  You are a family and he doesn\u2019t see himself as part of a the unit  - his needs come before you and the kids.  Really think about this relationship.  At the very least see a marriage counselor to hopefully make hubs see the error of his ways.", "YTA\nHave you even considered that it's not just the beach  but having to deal with extended family for 6 days.  That yearly trip to the beach sounds more like a 6 day family reunion/gathering instead of a vacation.", "NTA. What will your husband do if one of your daughters takes up beach volleyball as a passion? Or surfing? \u201cNope! I don\u2019t go to the beach!\u201d Please. Anybody saying \u201cit\u2019s not fair to make him do something he doesn\u2019t want\u201d have clearly never had children. Or they are those parents who force their kids to like what they like regardless of their kids interests.\n\nIt\u2019s nice your husband likes to hike. You don\u2019t object to that. You object to ONLY that and that\u2019s totally fair. \n\nWhat the people saying \u201cfind something you all like\u201d are missing is that this is a family trip. Your kids get to spend time with their grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles in a place they love. You don\u2019t just get to choose another place for a large family outing. \n\nYour husband is totally selfish and good for you for calling him out on it. Ask him how he plans to handle it when one of your kids inevitably develops an interest in something he doesn\u2019t enjoy. What is his plan going to be? To check out, complain, and be an asshole? If so tell him to take a nice long hike off a nice short pier", "What is with the ESH comments? As a parent, you do what your kids want. Suck it up. My parents always took my brother and me on cruises even though I get horribly sea sick and hated every second of it. I never forgot that they put their own happiness above mine for vacations. Your husband is a dick, OP. Go on vacation without him and make sure he parents his children when you guys are all at home. He sounds like a baby. NTA", "NTA\n\nGrowing up my brothers and I absolutely loved the beach, would beg our parents to go as frequently as they could take us. Dad doesn't like the beach and has a fear of the ocean, but he always dealt with it and CAME because he knew that we wanted him there. Our Dad loved camping but we absolutely hated it, but we went because we knew that HE loved it. When you care about people, it's a give and take situation sometimes. I can definitely tell you that the kids will remember these moments.", " NTA and that is wild that anyone is taking his side. It\u2019s the BEACH not the gulag. Part of being a parent is doing things that aren\u2019t your first choice because seeing your child\u2019s happiness makes you happy.

Because I love him and love doing what he enjoys.", "Your husband sounds like he was being a jerk, but honestly I would be miserable going on a vacation with 50+ family members. Especially if I didn\u2019t like the beach. And you expect him to go every year?", "NTA. Selfish is the kindest way to say how your husband is acting.  Does he really never do anything that will make OTHER PEOPLE happy?  Does he reeeeally believe, deep down, that his are the only feelings that matter? Just go and have a great time.  Leave that 4th child at home.", "NTA.\n\nThose beach trips are what memories are made of -- that time with the cousins and the extended family is so precious. Absolutely NTA.\n\nYour husband sure is, though. I'd bet he could do any number of things on that beach vacation without ever dipping a toe in the sand or surf. Almost all beach destinations have mini golf, movie theaters, hiking trails nearby... all sorts of things to do that don't involve the beach.\n\nHe is being extremely selfish here. If he didn't want to go because he didn't want to spend a week every summer with your extended family then that would be a different conversation and he would not be the A H... but that is not what this is about. \n\nCan you sugget to him that he look into hiking trails near the beach house? \n\nIts time to sit him down and discuss how you two might be able to compromise so the kids can spend time with cousins and extended family but so he's not brooding the entire time.", "NTA. Your husband is selfish and entitled, as made evident by his insistence that the only \"appropriate\" vacation is hiking. He is more concerned with his personal preferences than he is with making happy memories with his kids.

He is a crappy father, how and why have you put up with it for so long?\n\nYou hate the beach, but hey look, you go along and you do it for your kids, why can\u2019t he? You\u2019re making sacrifices, but he thinks it doesn\u2019t apply to him. He\u2019s only happy when he gets to do what HE WANTS. I think your husband is your biggest baby yet. \n\nHe is a selfish AH, tbh. He expects everyone to go hiking, something that kids undoubtedly hate, considering it\u2019s walking and we all know how lazy kids can be and sometimes they just genuinely tire easily. Yet he won\u2019t make the effort to return the favor? And the part where he flat out refused to do anything to help out with the kids AKA - refused to be a father, is way out of line. \nHe doesn\u2019t deserve you or your kids, he\u2019s a selfish deadbeat. \nHis life stopped being all about HIM the moment he got married and had kids. He can\u2019t have everything HIS way. When you have children you do the things that the KIDS like. He\u2019s not just selfish but he\u2019s also controlling. \n\nIs he like this at home too? Does he decide what gets cooked for dinner and what you all must eat? Does he decide what goes on the television? \n\nYou must have the patience of a saint to still be married to him. If I was in your place, the divorce papers would have been delivered long before now", "Some people really don't like the beach. Saltwater hurts your skin and eyes. Sand gets everywhere.

In fact, he will only go on vacations with us if it is a place of his choosing.\n\nIt sounds like he's refusing all the other options. There are plenty of vacation possibilities besides hiking and the beach. Your husband is allowed to veto the beach. So you really should stop bringing it up every year. Just because it's convenient and the kids like it doesn't mean it's a good family vacation. \n\nBut if he's vetoing every idea, then I have no idea what you're supposed to do. I'm going to assume that's what's going on here based on the quoted sentence.

It is sad that he won't suck it up and maybe even enjoy part of it.  There's a lot I've done for my family for their happiness.  I think those efforts have been well placed, personally.\n\nThat said, you married a guy who apparently won't budge on this.  Leave him home.  Go have the best time you can without his pouting face around raining on your fun.  Accept you can't change him but don't let his stance spoil your and your children's enjoyment of this gathering.  \n\nDon't be an AH and refuse to do any other type of family vacations.  That solves nothing and could actually be harmful.

He at least doesn\u2019t let his attitude about it show to anyone else, but I do get to suffer the consequences myself of inviting him to things.

If he hates the beach that much and ruins it for everyone else, why do you want him there?\n\nI absolutely hate camping.  Nothing about it appeals to me.  I know I would whine and complain the entire time because I hate the cold and dark and pretty much everything to do with camping.  I'm self aware enough to know I would ruin a trip for everyone else, so I'm very upfront about it.  I literally say, \"I hate camping, I will complain the whole time and ruin it for everyone *and I don't  want to ruin it for the rest of you.\"*  I always told my kids if they want to try camping, they can always go with my sister and her family because they love it and would make it fun.  (Obviously I would pack for my kids and send more food than they would even need that they can cook on a campfire, but I don't want to be there.)  I don't think it's the worst thing in the world to say, I can't enjoy this and I don't want to ruin it for everyone else, but I want you to enjoy it. In the same token, my boyfriend absolutely hates some things I find ridiculous, but if I know he doesn't want to go, I automatically give him an out.  He knows he's invited, but he doesn't have to come.  And with my sister, while she is an awesome camper, she hates a planned timeline of activities and refuses to commit to group activities on vacation because she likes to do whatever she wants to do.  For example, sister and BIL go on trips with friends.  One guy is super type-A and wants everything planned to a t.   She tells him, plan whatever you want, if I feel like going, I'll show up.  If not, I'll be at the beach/pool reading a book, pleasantly content and enjoying her own vacation.\n\nDoes he get upset when you go without him, or is he happy for you guys?  I guess that would be the main component.  If he gets pissy, that's a problem.  But if he's genuinely happy that you guys can enjoy this without him, I don't see the problem.

Every summer, my family takes a vacation to the beach. I'm not a huge beach fan, but our kids LOVE it, plus my mom pays for me and my siblings and our families, so it's almost a free trip (excluding travel there, which usually isn't a huge cost). Some years only some of my family makes it, but a few years ago my entire family (50+ people) went as a last trip with my grandma. Husband HATES the beach, but reluctantly went with us. \n\nHis behavior was HORRENDOUS. He wouldn't leave the condo, bailed on previously booked activities that made the cost go up for others, and didn't help AT ALL with our kids. It was basically like he wasn't there, and when he was, he was complaining the whole time. I was so embarrassed. My whole family gave me the pitying stares the whole time and tried to help me as best they could, but it was just a miserable time. Our daughters begged him to play on the beach with them and he just wouldn't engage at all.\n\nSince then, he hasn't accompanied us back. In fact, he will only go on vacations with us if it is a place of his choosing. Which is usually hiking. Don't get me wrong, I like to hike, but I'd also like to do other things. And so would the kids.\n\nNow on to the part where I called him selfish.\n\nWe are now planning our trip for this summer to the beach, and once again, he says he will not go. The kids are devastated again, because they want him to go so they can swim together and build sandcastles together. He says he just hates the beach and there's no changing his mind.\n\nI got frustrated and called him selfish because he never wants to do anything that the kids enjoy. He said I was being a jerk and there's nothing I can do that will make him like the beach. I told him it's not about liking the beach, it's about spending time with his family. He says we could skip it and go hiking instead if we want to spend time together. So I said we won't be going on anymore of his vacations.\n\nNow I feel guilty, since that was the one thing he would do with us. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We\u2019ve gone to trips where it was a mix of culture and museums. Less churches unless there\u2019s art. But we would alternate and ask the kids what they would be interested in.

I can easily see OP pressuring the husband because her parents pay for the trip and kids ( like most) like the beach so the expectation is that he should always go willingly and with a smile. Watching movies that we don\u2019t like or taking kids to an event for an hour or two once in a while is easily tolerable. 6 days every summer could be as well- but if your allotted vacation time from work is limited- it can also become draining to have that dictated for you every summer.", "Everyone seems to be fixating on the beach part and what OP and the kids want and completely ignoring that this is a colossal forced cruise ship event WITH PLANNED ACTIVITIES  with the inlaws.

What I ended of finding was that when I went solo, I knew I was responsible for everything- planned it all out, thought out all the logistics etc. It was a lot of work, but incredibly satisfying and some of our greatest memories! \n\nHowever, when my husband came along (my boys and I usually frequented Disney, the mountains, or our second home) on one of our frequented destinations, we were all super excited, but it was somewhat of a flop. What I realized was that my expectations were that my husband would take some of the stress and heavy lifting off me during the trip so I wouldn\u2019t have to be \u201cON\u201d 100% of the time. While he certainly tried, he didn\u2019t know our routine and so I found myself becoming MORE stressed because he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing it right\u201d, which honestly wasn\u2019t his fault at all- it was my expectations. \n\nI wonder, since this is a frequent destination for you, the kids and your family - Is it possible that he is a bit odd man out because he doesn\u2019t know the routine? Then sees your increase in stress and that turns him off more? I also just wonder since you stated multiple times how he\u2019s not a beach/sun person- is it at all possible he has almost a sensory processing disorder related to sand/wet sand/sun? I love tropical destinations, but actually break out in hives (SLE) and prefer the pool to the beach - my son with autism is the same- wet sand everywhere is not his idea of fun! \n\nFrom my experience, I\u2019d make this a you + kids yearly trip. You will make AMAZING memories and feel like an absolute rockstar that you did it by yourself - plus your kids will learn more responsibility as they grow because you will begin to rely on them for things and they\u2019ll rise to the challenge! I think trying to force your husband to come is only going to make it an unhappy vacation for everyone.", "Yes, he would probably do that.", "NAH. \n\nI wondered about this. I LOVE the beach but my skin was crawling just reading the description of these trips. There would be no circumstances on earth that could drag me on that trip. Not even for my kids, who are the most important thing to me in the world.\n\nA family trip like that is not a vacation. It's an obligation that he's apparently opting out of.  \n\nYou're NTA for wanting him to go and for calling him selfish (though he's being justifiably selfish imo) but YTA for saying the kids can't go with him on his trips.", "You said this very eloquently.", "I would be more inclined to believe it was the big group nature of the trip if it weren't for the part where he is unwilling to go anywhere he doesn't choose.

Yet you state that this is the only place that you all agree on continuously. Do you see how confusing that all is? \n\nAs for your husband. He is in a no-win situation. Damned if he does, damned if he don't if you will. He goes, and he has a miserable time, which causes others to also be miserable. He gets stares and hears complaints. He doesn't go, and your kids are upset, and you all still complain. The beach isn't for everybody. I, myself, can't stand the beach. Don't like the heat, don't swim, don't collect seashells, nothing.

My advice would be to stop trying to make him come with you to the beach, but he needs to be the one to break the news to your kids. Though it's not your responsibility, for their sake, suggest to him that he comes up with some other specific bonding activity to do with them to make up for it. Perhaps taking them to the pool or something.\n\nIt will suck for your kids that their dad isn't there for them in that regard, but they'll be ok because they have you to show up for them. Trust me, you being the parent that shows up will be noted and appreciated.\n\nAnd also as someone growing up with a Dad who was kind of ...emotionally absent...I so, so, so appreciated the bonding time with him that in hindsight was facilitated by my mum.

I\u2019m not sure if you live in Australia but we have crystal caverns, parks with waterfalls, treetop walks and hot mineral springs (they have spas and walking track that leads to springs that you can pump your own water).\n\nThese activities can be something the kids might like and make the trip more interesting. From some of them you can get souvenirs like crystals from the crystal caverns.", "You\u2019re forcing this issue to the point that you are causing him to dig his heels in. This is just as much on you. No one cares if the whole family is there. Do something all four of you want to do. The beach isn\u2019t it, or pick a beach on a lake in the mountains. There are plenty of other beaches.", "Then you be the parent at that moment and do the beach activities with the kids.", "So I've read through a lot of your comments, and it sounds a lot like he is willing to go anywhere that isn't the beach.  \n\n\nAnd when he did try it the once, he remembered how much he absolutely hates the beach the second he got there. So he just opted out. Because yeah of course he would, he's miserable there.   \n\n\nIf it was a day or two then I'd say yeah he should suck it up, but this is like a week long vacation. It sounds a lot like he is willing to do basically anything as long as it isn't on a beach. He also is super consistent with that, even rejecting his families attempts for beach holidays. I get your family and even you and your kids love the beach, that's great. But it sounds to me like you just aren't getting how much he hates this vacation.  \n\n\nHe would literally rather sit in bed doing nothing for 6 days then be at the beach. He chose to spend the rest of his life with you, he clearly loves you, he goes on hikes with you and spends time with you, so he clearly likes being around you. Even then, the hate he has for the beach means he would rather just do nothing then be at a beach.  \n\n\nIf you had a location like that, and you absolutely despised it, if being there made you so miserable that you couldn't hide it, couldn't fake the energy. Why would you go?  \n\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for being upset, but I also understand why he is too. It comes across to me like you desperately want him to like the beach, when he never will. Just because all the other people like it doesn't mean he has to.  \n\n\nIf you want practical advice, then try to find activities in the same area as the beach that he would be willing to do, that way you can still spend time as a family without making him do shit he hates. If your kids are into it there will probably be laser tag or paintball, maybe even bowling if he's into it. That way he can still go on the trip without being on the beach, maybe even look into getting hotels further from the shore.  \n\n\nAnd if your worried about your kids getting upset, have him get them something or make them something while you're at the beach or away on the 6 day trip if he doesn't go, that way they know their dad was thinking about them even if he wasn't there.", "Who said it has to be a family vacation with inlaws? That could be half the problem.", "I'm noticing a pattern here.  He loves hiking (relatively people free,  in nature and quiet) but doesn't like the beach,  the pool area, or the mall.  Does he generally avoid crowded, noisy, or peopled areas? If so,  I think there might be more to the story.  Some people,  whether it's due to Autism, mental health, or other issues, can't handle it to be around crowds.  Even larger family events.  For some, it's social anxiety. For others, it's a strong sensory problem or auditory processing issues. \n\nIf a grown man can't find 1 thing to like or enjoy about a beach trip/ holiday with his immediate family or a way to entertain himself, then I'd be thinking that there's more going on.  Even extremely lazy and selfish people could find something to do at nearly all expenses paid holiday. The fact that he refuses makes me think there is a lot more to the situation. \n\nNAH because I understand your frustration, and you wanted to show him what it's like.  Sounds like you guys need a big conversation. Perhaps after you've calmed, ask him to be really clear about \"why.\" From there, you might be able to think of some solutions other than hiking.  But his \"why\" might mean you go solo to the beach.  But if other than this, he's a good husband and father, you might be OK with him not going.  Kids and families can make special moments in the everyday. Really, so what if he doesn't go? It's 6 days out of a year.  If he hates it that much, don't force it. Everyone will be miserable.  And yes, you do things for your kid',  but as adult,  we have choice,  and it's good for kids to know that their parents are people with preferences too. \n\nBut if it's always his way with no compromise and he's not present in your life, then you might want to rethink how your family is operating. Good luck.", "So do something that isn\u2019t \u201ctake them to a place your husband hates.\u201d\n\nBe a family and come up with a trip you can all enjoy. If he refuses to make compromises on that, then you can come back and complain.", "but you are making him do something he clearly does not want to do. He could 100% have a better attitude about it, but I don't think he's completely being selfish, I think both of you could compromise. He should also do something he enjoys instead of it always being about the kids otherwise it's just forced.", "I think you should compromise and have him go on the trip for a day or two, max.

Can he not get a book describing all the different shells and kinds of plants and sand and pebbles that one can find at the  beach? Can he not get a couple of kites to fly when there's enough wind? Can he not get some shovels and shapes and build sandcastles? Can he not bring a book to read whilst watching his kids play? What about bringing flippers to swim faster, or a body board or paddle board or even rent a canoe/kayak? Can he not get factor 50 sun screen and wear a sun hat, sun glasses, and long sleeves/bring a screen to create shade? Can he not go on a long beach walk with a bucket to collecting shells whilst he gets an exercise (it's almost like hiking, considering it's walking)?\n\nI am sorry OP, this guy sounds lame and selfish AF.

OP is obviously a drama queen based on the way she presented this situation and her choice of words - especially the obnoxious capitalization. Husband is probably the AH for all the obvious reasons, but you also don\u2019t know what he really said about any info his. It\u2019s too clouded because of the way she biased the story so heavily in her favor.", "I love hiking and absolutely hate beaches.  It\u2019s the sand and the saltwater.  I don\u2019t even like picnics because I don\u2019t like sitting on the ground, even with a towel/blanket.", "I live 15 minutes from one of the top 10 beaches in the world.\n\nIt's fucking awful. So crowded, bathrooms are impossible to find, it's humid as hell, sand lingers for months, food's expensive as hell or you're harassed by the birds that tourists feed, I burn easily so I have to decide between a rashguard that makes me sweat to hell or applying sunscreen every 30 minutes because I'll sweat it off, and so on.\n\nHiking I can dress to my comfort level, there's generally shade available, plenty of private places to relieve yourself if needed, and if you're wearing the right boots, you aren't dragging home a sandboxes' worth of dirt in with you.", "I completely agree.  Dad is an adult with agency. He can decide not to go to the beach, even if his kids would prefer that he go, and still be a good father!!\n\nNow, it's not great that he shoots down other nuclear family trips unless they cater to his desires and interests.  That's not part of being a respectful partner, imo.  But he absolutely does not have to go on this trip and he's not an AH for declining to do so.", "I think you'll find most places don't have those.", "It isn\u2019t needed yearly to survive, but when it\u2019s free and the kids enjoy it, then saying no to the kids seems really selfish and ridiculous.", "Right, why is nobody considering how much it sucks for the dad? There are no other vacation spots that every can enjoy? I'm leaning towards ESH because OP is not making an effort to accommodate for her husband's preferences. And his behavior sucks.\n\nIf he doesn't want to come, it's on him to explain why to the kids. I like it.", "Why the hell should it be all on her? Her husband should step the fuck up for the sake of HIS OWN kids {just like OP does, as she also hates the beach} and stop being a selfish deadbeat. \n\nBeing a parent means making sacrifices, you do things for your children when you\u2019re a parent - whether you like those activities or not", "We do enjoy hiking, but that's literally all he ever wants to do. Should we skip out on our beach vacation because he doesn't want to go? I don't think that's fair to the children.", "He only does things he enjoys.", "Sorry but what is so bad about the beach that one would simply refuse to ever go there? OP's husband needs to wake up to the fact he's got kids and it's not all about him all the time. When you have kids, you don't get to be the main/sole person to decide where holidays are going to be. In this case, OP's family plan this big extended family holiday that is paid for by OP's parents so the costs are low, OPs family chooses this to be a beach holiday, OP loves the beach and so do the kids, but husband acts like a toddler who didn't get his way the whole time, refusing to take care of his own kids, refusing to engage, and acting ungrateful and whiney around OP's family (who are paying for this trip). \n\nHusband not going is pushing all the childcare responsibilities on OP for the duration of that holiday whilst he gets all that time to himself. Has he offered to reciprocate by taking the kids on a trip of similar length so OP can have the house to herself? But still, like OP said, the kids are beginning to notice they are the only kids where their dad can't be bothered to show up for having fun at the beach. Even if you don't like the beach, the kids clearly do so husband should suck it up and make it work. It's called parenting.", "His mom and dad and his sister and her nuclear family go on beach trips. He says no. I don't have it in me to do 2 solo trips a year.", "THEIR children.

He gets aggravated with my mom because she brings a lot of stuff and he hates having to help her with it. For clarification, though, my brother, brother in law, and grown nephews will also help. \n\nIt was not a tradition before we were married. It was something that came about as my siblings and cousins and I all started having children around the same time and wanted them to be close like we were growing up.\n\nMy husband does not get along with his extended family, but it's never been anything he's been sad about.", "He could not force you to visit his family.\n\nI would have put my foot down and said \u2018Fine. Stay home.I am visiting my family, yours will have to wait for you to be in the mood to visit them.\u2019", "I got caught in an undertow as a child, 7 yo or so. My older brother saw me go under and started reaching under the waves to find me. I'm not sure who made contact first, but I remember finding his leg & hanging on. \n\nMany years later, he said he almost lost his grip on me, the current was so strong. He was about 13 and hadn't hit the growth spurt that shot him up to 6'2\". If he'd been any younger or lighter, we might have both been lost. If he hadn't been right there to see me go down, I almost certainly would have died. \n\nIt took seconds. Even at that age, I was a strong swimmer, but it didn't help. I'm not sure my parents even knew it happened at the time or later. Pretty sure they would have curtailed my swimming if they had. My father swam well, but my mother could dog paddle, at best. \n\nBecause he acted so fast, I didn't end up frightened of the water. It was years later when I realized just how close I came to losing my life.\n\nAll it takes is looking away at the wrong moment. Opening a soda. Moving the cooler. Putting on some more sunscreen. A kid can go under and not come back up. If you don't see them go down, you'll only have a general idea where they were. \n\nToo many people treat the ocean or a river like a pool, especially if there are lifeguards. They can't see everything, but people seem to think they can.", "But should he be forced to suck it up and go every single year? That sounds so unreasonable to me.  I would never under any circumstances vacation with extended family let alone give up my vacation time every single year for a trip I actively hate.  Why would anyone do that?!", "I mean.....they beg him to go to the beach and he won't do that. Even when he was AT the beach. Doesn't seem like a parent who's lying in the floor playing with their kid. Ever.", "I hate the beach and my 6 year old has only visited at maybe 3 times . I know he gets really excited at the though and I can't wait to take him ,, but I really hate the beach, its so boring bit ill do it for my child", "..... you deserve better.", "I hope she doesn\u2019t cover for him but I also know even if she doesn\u2019t kids aren\u2019t dumb. \n\nPeople tried to cover for my parents but I knew they just sucked as parents", "Bluey is the absolute best!

You don\u2019t have to give up everything for your kids. Going to a reunion for your in laws every year is way too often. Being free is irrelevant if one person hates it. Every other year, fine, but not every year.", "And I\u2019m sure he thinks that it isn\u2019t fair he doesn\u2019t get to spend his limited vacation days hiking because you and the children don\u2019t want to do that. \n\nAnd? \n\nYou\u2019re going to have to do some work here to figure out a vacation everyone can enjoy. It\u2019s not going to just happen.\n\nThat involves discussions. Creating buy-in. Gathering consensus. \n\nIt\u2019s how family vacations have been planned since they were invented.", "Okay, but you're talking about vacations, which SHOULD be enjoyed. That's literally the point of them. So he's not \"selfish\" for literally not wanting to do *things he doesn't enjoy* during his limited vacation time.\n\nIf you want to do something other than hiking, that's fair. Sit down and talk to him (you know, like grown-ups) about what else he thinks he might enjoy that you could do on vacation. If he loves to hike maybe he'd like to travel somewhere that has great walking tours. \n\nBut there's nothing selfish about not wanting to do things you hate on vacation. And if you desperately want to do those things with your kids...go without him.", "this is why I said compromise, you can't just shove him into a situation so it could make everyone else happy, it doesn't work like that. You need to have a convo with him about coming to a middle ground, him being more \"open\" to doing things outside his comfort zone and you being accepting of taking baby steps. \n\nPut yourself in his shoes, and if the roles were reversed I'm sure you would want to go at a pace which he could respect but makes you push your boundaries a bit more.", "Completely understandable, 2 trips as solo parent to young kids at the beach seems too much to ask.", "Are you daft? Obviously when I say your children that's what I'm referring to. Should I have said your biological children you had together where you are both the parents instead?", "For them to not agree with switching the place up some times (even if only every once a few years) makes them join the bit-of-an-AH squad. Just sounds like a meh situation all over.\n\nIf he's otherwise doing the baseline parent things (not ignoring household chores, usually taking care of his kids etc) then I'd say it might almost be better for you to go on your own vacation instead.", "...Yeah. I'm not too surprised he doesn't get along with his own family.  Maybe there's some trauma there, maybe not.  Whether there's a justified reason or not, he doesn't want to put his kids before himself.  \n\nI just can't imagine such a childish reaction from an adult who's just punishing his own kids who want to share memories with their dad. I guess he doesn't see it that way, but I can't see it any other way.\n\nLike others have said, there's a lot of room for compromise here (beach every other year, etc.), but that requires both of you to have a calm conversation and want to compromise.  Based on his refusal to go to the beach at all and his childish, petulant behavior during the one time he went to the beach (agreeing to activities then backing out last minute, isolating in the condo), I doubt he'd be willing to compromise right now.\n\nHave you considered counseling for the two of you?  It seems like he has some issues to work through in order to be a good partner and father, and you probably have resentment/anger over this (I know I would!).\n\nI'm kinda torn between ESH (your ultimatum wasn't going to help) and NTA (what the fuck kind of dad is so selfish???).  I'm leaning towards NTA, because I think your ultimatum came after years of his childish BS and you snapped because you're so frustrated about how this is negatively affecting your kids.\n\nNTA.", "I almost lost two lifeguards who were off duty like that.  They somehow made it back.", "Because they have kids and supposedly loves them and the kids get excited for the yearly beach trip with their extended family.\n\nLook, I get it. I can't stand my husband's family of origin trips, they are rude, they don't accept the concept of people liking different things, they are too loud and are always inviting random people they know that usually makes things awkward. All in all when at its absolute best is a boring trip and my husband hates it too... And it was all fine and dandy when it was just the two of us, we just never went anymore after we did the mistake of going once. But now we have a daughter and we both know we are coming to a point we will have to suck it up and go to the trips because they are her family, she loves playing with her cousins, her grandparents and other adults want to bond and have fun with her and not going to these trips will put a damp in her relationships with her family, not on purpose, but if aunty Becky and uncle James get to spend all this fun time with little Joe but can't with her they will obviously be closer to Joe.\n\nI could just tell my husband \"too bad, so sad\" and tell him to go alone because it's his family and my family doesn't have anything similar to make it \"fair\" but going alone would make a lousy trip even harder without someone to tag team it (and we only have a fairly well behaved daughter, OP has 3 kids) but mostly I don't do it because a) I love my husband and b) I love my daughter. I would not only just do anything to make her life better and her happier but seeing how happy she gets, her enjoy all these new things and moments makes me happy too.\n\nAnd going back to OP: why does 4 people have to suck it up and go hiking every-single-time with him? Again, he is a parent. The job of sucking up and bearing is his and her, not the kids.", "I don't expect every year. But once in a while would be nice.", "Talking that way is dramatic. It\u2019s how dramatic people convey themselves online. Also, the language mirrors the level of drama quite closely. The OP is completely biased and one-sided. Some people at least pretend to have written a fair assessment of the situation, but that\u2019s not what happened here. Also, the only thing we can do is make assumptions, especially when the OP is clearly biased.", "I have sensory processing disorder and wear socks almost 24/7 because I can't stand stuff touching my feet. I still suck it up and go. I just want him to go every so often.", "If your kids are requesting it and you continually shut them down and insist on only going on vacations you choose though then that would be a problem.", "They don\u2019t go every year.", "She\u2019s literally said several times she enjoys hiking and they do that a lot. He refuses to compromise at all and do anything other than hiking because he\u2019s a selfish prick and if he doesn\u2019t get his way, then no one is allowed to be happy.", "Most parents who take their kids to Disneyland probably absolutely hate it on some level (most sane adults don't choose to use any of their limited vacation on Disneyland unless they have kids), but it's about the kids having fun, right? If your kids are having a blast, wouldn't that be the most important thing and make it at least nominally enjoyable? I'm not a parent but seems like at least some family vacations are about what kids want. And if there is a big extended family get-together offered--wouldn't it be a shame if the kids missed out just because daddy doesn't like getting salt in his eyes or whatever?", "Which shows just how lucky my brother and I were. The same kind of thing nearly took two *adults*. We were just kids!", "But he's not preventing the kids or OP from going on these trips!  \n\nOP gets to go spend time with her extended family.\n\nThe kids get to hang out with their cousins.\n\nThe only thing they're missing out on is building sandcastles with their dad. I mean maybe he could go with them once or twice and make some Fun Family Memories but in the specific scenario that OP posted he is absolutely not an AH for saying nope I want no part of this. \n\nNow should he compromise and do something all of them enjoy for their nuclear family trips?  Yes absolutely.   But for the specific issue that OP posted, he is not the AH for not wanting to go on a huge extended family trip to a place he hates!", "cool there's a difference between having methods to alleviate sensory processing issues and forcing somebody to have theirs exacerbated because my friends or family wanna go to the beach.", "Technically. They were 16 and it was at a summer camp. So, I guess they were kids too.  Although lead lifeguard who was 20 hit her head on something in the water and I and had to save her.  My father taught me never to turn my back on the ocean and give it lots of respect.", "There\u2019s also a difference between choosing and flat out refusing to consider methods to alleviate specific issues. And I didn\u2019t note that dad has any specific disorder in this case.", "Wait did I miss the part where the dad's got a disorder against the beach?", "Still older than 7 & 13, but yeah, still kids, too. I'm glad they made it out. I didn't live near the ocean. We were on vacation. I started swim classes very young, but that was in a pool, of course. It may have been my first time playing in the ocean. Possibly my brother's, too. We did have relatives in California, so he could have been there before."]}
