Her comments are hurtful.  It's one thing to find a celebrity attractive.  But to say she'd leave you for that person is giving an unnecessary emotional sting.  \n\nLet her know how you feel.  If she reacts poorly to telling her this, it gives a hint about her priorities.  If she owns up to being clueless or  insensitive and apologizes, it's one thing.  If she says you are overreacting, be aware she may dismiss your feelings as unimportant in the future too.", "NTA. What you do is ask who her hall pass would be. When she says her celebrity crush tell her yours is something like \u201ca chick I work with\u201d. Fun for all.", "I dated a girl like this and it was annoying, to the point where I ghosted her.  Zero class", "NTA, she\u2019s not being considerate. Ig some people in relationships can have physical attraction towards celebrities. I could see how that\u2019s fine. But it seems like in conversations she\u2019s almost baiting you into feeling insecure, testing the waters to see how you\u2019d react (maybe that\u2019s me assuming though \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). \n\nIn conversations between the two of you, that time should be cherished and you should get the full attention you deserve. It\u2019d be different if it was a secret admiration : most ppl have instances where they find other people attractive, even if it\u2019s just on a physical level. but whats the point in her obsessing over hypothetical scenarios so publicly and adamantly: and even to her beloved? it\u2019s insensitive: especially to say she\u2019d leave you for them.\n\nI\u2019d tell her that it upsets you like \u2018I feel upset when you express attraction to celebrities so openly, how can we resolve this?\u2019 its good to be open and direct. It\u2019ll be telling how she responds.", "You're NTA \n\n>She\u2019s said a couple times that if that celebrity was near us or expressed interest in her, she would leave me for them in a heartbeat. \n\nSo that only applies if it's a celebrity? Because it sounds like she would cast you aside for anyone who rates a bit higher on her superficial scale.\n\nI once dated some who made similar remarks. I beat him to it, and highly recommend you do the same.", "No you wouldn't. Telling you she'd leave you for them is a horrible thing to say and obviously damaging to your relationship.", "NTA this is the female equivalent of liking Ig girls tho just sayin\u2026. So keep in mind lol", "If my girl admitted a crush on anyone I\u2019d leave her.  Celebrities are people too. We live in LA, we see them all the time.", "NTA. She's probably just trying to elicit jealousy or possessiveness from you but it's immature.", "Absolutely NTA. There's a difference between just having a celebrity crush and legitimately thinking you'd leave your SO for this crush... her telling you this so unashamedly, and reposting the celeb in such a way is just disrespectful. You should definitely have a conversation with her. You're fully justified in feeling upset.", "YWNBTA.\n\nHaving any sort of parasocial relationship with a celebrity is pathetic; they don't even know or care you exist except as a statistic to exploit. Lusting after obviously hot people all the time is shallow, fruitless, and almost always diminishing to your partner. Not to mention obliviously stupid--of COURSE they look hot, of course we all wouldn't mind banging them, but also there are so many practical, pragmatic, and ethical reasons why we can't and won't.\n\nNothing wrong with you both having a little fantasy crush here or there in passing, but it is the volume and amount of time spent preoccupied with these things that make a person fairly inconsiderate, overly concerned with fantasy, and boring to be around.\n\nI doubt she will receive it well and you'll likely end up breaking up over how basic and stupid she is, but you are entitled to call out that behavior all the same. Put another way: she already has admitted that she cares more about these crushes than you, in a sense--let her have them, go find yourself someone who is more grounded in reality.", "Play her game. Just start firing off with hot ladies left and right, not just celebs, models, sports ladies. Just any lady you think is hot and never let up. Maybe she'll get the point?", "NTA\n\nIf it was just the occasional post of a celebrity she found attractive I'd say you were just being insecure, since that's pretty normal (though I admit I also don't understand celebrity crushes). But the fact she said she'd leave you for them is really crappy and honestly kind of delusional.", "NTA.  Dump her, she sounds like a complete waste human narcissist.  You can do better.", "NTA to expect a bit more respect, especially saying she\u2019d leave you for them, I suspect she\u2019s not deliberately trying to hurt you but she needs to understand that she is.", "NTA. you have to share your feelings or else this will just be an uncomfortable relationship where she keeps doing stuff you don't like", "Don't be so insecure. You don't own her. You check people out too, I guarandamntee it. \n\nStart talking about them hot gymnasts or figure skaters or beach volleyball ball players. Sorry, I've played sports all my life, so that's my type, lol. \n\nPeople can look all they want. I look, they look, we all look. \n\nTit for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've said to my husband multiple times I'd leave him for Mila Kunis (pre all the stuff with the other guy being awful drama stuff). It's all in jest and I don't think even once my husband has thought I meant it. I will, indeed, leer at any pic posted of Chris Hemsworth and show my husband so he may also leer.\n\nThe point is, she might see it as silly fun because celebrities are barely people, more like fictional characters, and she likely doesn't expect you to be trying to compare yourself to them.\n\nThese people jumping in telling you to bail on her are just being ridiculous. You haven't even had the conversation yet so how could she even know it bothers you?\n\nYou're absolutely NTA if you talk to her about how you feel on this matter, open communication is never an asshole move assuming you're not being a jerk about it. If I were to guess, she has no idea it's rubbing you the wrong way because she doesn't see these \"people\" as people (which really, for 99% of us, they're not). She's also not an asshole if she doesn't want to stop because celebrity bullshit is something she finds fun. It is possible for two people to be incompatible without one of them being an ass. If her idea of fun doesn't align with your emotional needs, that is okay and you're maybe just not compatible at this time.\n\nOr, maybe she'll be horrified she's put that stress on you because she only meant it as silliness and it's not a problem going forward.\n\nThe point is, talk to them. Either you're compatible or not.

Explain the situation and ask her kindly. If you were to start making demands about it, that would cause you to drift in A territory. On a related note, maybe look into talking to a professional about your insecurities. It could help your relationship in the long run, and possibly help you to figure out their root, which would help your overall mental health.

She wants you to be clear that she ranks you as her real life partner far below these absurd fantasy partners. That's cruel (not to mention deluded). The bottom line is she is pointedly emphasizing how little she values you. Time for you to let this relationship end for good, because you're the only one in it.
