It's not pleasant to contemplate especially as he chooses to be like this.", "There will always be times when you can't do something with others that you enjoy. When you were given no heads-up ahead of time that you were supposed to go somewhere with them, you have no time to prepare. You chose to do your schoolwork before getting ready, and this is because you didn't know what was going on (and, as I see from another of your comments, this is what's usually expected of you). There's no reason to feel guilty about situations like this.\n\nMy parents did this to me at times, they would tell me we were going somewhere after they had gotten ready and were about to walk out the door; I wouldn't know what was going on, and when I didn't get ready quickly enough and was confused, I got screamed at. This is abuse.\n\nNTA."]}
