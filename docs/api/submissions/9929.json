My best friend was a huge part of our wedding. When she got engaged, she made it clear that she wanted both me and my husband to be in her wedding. She said she wanted me on her side with the rest of her bridesmaids. But, I noticed that my friend was being distant so I asked her and she said that she didn't want to talk. I work with her cousin, so when I went to work, I asked about my friend. Her cousin said my friend was upset because my husband wasn't going to be in the wedding. I asked why, she said \"because you're not in it.\" That was the first I'd heard of it.\n\nI asked my husband and other friend who was in the wedding and they both said the decision to remove me from the wedding was made A WEEK PRIOR. My husband said that he was invited tuxedo shopping but I couldn't come. He said that if I couldn't be there, he didn't want to be in the wedding. I thought about what I was going to say and texted her. I asked why she didn\u2019t want me in it and why she didn't tell me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter I sent that text, an unknown number had called my husband. He didn't answer, I called them back. It was my friend's soon-to-be MIL, she had given her his number. She said that we did not care about our friend and that we were the reason her mental health was poor. She went as far as saying that if something bad had happened to her, it would be our fault. She said that they wanted to make sure she had a \"traditional\" wedding and that they couldn't have me up there with her. I cursed out the MIL and hung up on her. When my friend asked why I did, I just said she had no right to say what she said.\n\nLater, my friend wanted us all to meet up and talk. We spoke with my friend, her mother and a couple from their church. Immediately, me and my husband were screamed at about how we didn't care about her and how we're making this all about us. Her mom yelled at my husband that he wasn\u2019t allowed to back out of the wedding and that it isn't his decision. They said that the reason they couldn't have me in the wedding was because it went against their religion to \"honor a homosexual marriage\". I was angry, so I yelled about how it wasn't fair that they couldn't have told me the truth and that I had to hear about it from her cousin. Or I was the only one who they had to exclude. They said that they weren't excluding me. I said \"you are if my husband is there and I'm not.\" One half of the gay couple was still going to be present. They said we're taking it too personal and that we need to \"see it from their POV.\" It felt like excuses. I asked if it was because I was more fem presenting. I only got a \"well.\"\n\nWe left, I felt worse. I didn't feel like there was any closure or resolution. I'm not even sure if I want to even continue trying to salvage this friendship. I don\u2019t want to make the situation worse, but I don't even want to go to the wedding.

She even surprised your partner with the information. You do not denote someone unless they do sonething major, and you DO tell them yourself.\n\nShe acted like a dying swan when called out,  hiding behind her family because she knew that she was wrong and was too ashamed to tell you herself. \n\nHer family then blamed you as a couple for \"ruining her wedding\" by being hurt that she disrespected your relationship and messed you around. You or your husband have every right to not attend her wedding and he has every right to step down from his role. If they cannot support your relationship why the hell should you stand to support theirs?", "NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you.

You don't need that type of negativity in your life.", "NTA that logic doesn\u2019t even make sense. Your husband can be in the wedding but not you?

Find friends that support you and your husband instead of causing drama and strife.", "NTA\n\nShe's a shit friend didn't even have the decency to tell you that you weren't invited or why herself. \nYou and your hubby should ghost her.", "NTA, obviously. Telling off someone who's belittling your humanity is not making a scene. It's justified.\n\nETA: I'm tired of the idea that reacting to wrongdoing, especially extreme, egregious wrongdoing like we see here, is making a scene. The people who wronged you made the scene but didn't want anyone else to see. You drew attention to their hatefulness and made them feel bad, poor things.\n\nUnreal to me that your \"friend\" didn't even tell you that you'd been disinvited. How cowardly. She knew she should be ashamed and did it anyway.\n\nI'm so sorry. I can't imagine how heartbreaking this is. I hope you replace them with true friends who love you.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m wondering why your husband didn\u2019t tell you right away? He should have told you in my opinion. Not the cousin a week later.\n\nYour friend is not your friend now. The bigots are the ones messing with the bride\u2019s mental health. Sadly she can\u2019t stand up to any of them AND she let them bully you and your hubby at the meet up. \n\nDo something fun with your husband on that day.", "NTA\n\nYou're dealing with a bunch of bigots.\n\nAs for your friend, I'd guess she knows full well she is treating you horribly and her guilt is the reason for her not telling you herself and having \"poor mental health\". Let her suffer. If she wants to redeem herself, she has a lot of work ahead of her. So far she's been a complete coward and a terrible friend so I wouldn't be holding my breath.", "With friends like these, who needs enemies??\n\nNTA and please drop these so called \"friend\" from your life, if she isn't stopping her religious bigoted mum then she approves it indirectly. I would block her on everything and never speak to her again.", "NTA-your friend was in your wedding and was happy for you to be in hers, then a giant shift. Do you think she was bullied into kicking you out (not excusing, just wondering)? If others are paying for the wedding they seem to be dictating the rules which is why she couldn\u2019t face you. I would feel bad for her but she is trading her backbone and your friendship for an expensive party.", "My beach is gay how can i be homophobic ? Sorry for the central cee joke but she is not your friend and she dont respect you and your husband. Block her and live your life. Being religious does not mean you have to disrespect other people. NTA", "NTA. And if either of you try to keep this \u201cfriend\u201d then you\u2019re both be AH to yourselves. The DISRESPECT they have shown, and your \u201cfriend\u201d just passed the buck to her MIL because she felt embarrassed to be railroaded by their \u201ctraditional\u201d views. She lacks a spine, if she cares for you she would\u2019ve either told you as to not cause conflict or told her MIL to kick rocks. And the fact that your husband is \u201cnot allowed\u201d to not be on the wedding? I would\u2019ve probably slapped her. WHO IS SHE TO DEMAND ADULTS TO DO THINGS?\nEdited to add: your \u201cfriend\u201d also sucks by putting the monetary value of a glorified party over your friendship. If they truly cared about you and having you in the wedding they would\u2019ve declined the money and included you in it. The lack of that shows that truly they were only around for convenience and looks, if she apologizes later it\u2019s only because she realized how truly awful she was being. Do not give in.", "NTA, they're a bunch of ill-mannered bigots hiding behind their religion. If your friend had sat down with you before you heard via someone else, then MAYBE this could have been salvaged, but honestly, if she's catering to her homophobic in-laws, she's making her bed and will have to lie in it. That should not include you being part of some phony charade, you have the right to be who you are.\n\nDrop your \"friend\", it's not worth it, surround yourself with people who love and appreciate who you are, and have enough spine to not cater to bigots.", "NTA sounds like MIL overruled the bride based on religious bs and she's going with it. This friendship is over", "NTA \n\nIf she was your friend she would tell her MIL to pound sand.", "NTA.  First they renoved you from the wedding without telling you.  Then they had the audacity to tell your husband it wasn't his decision to drop out of the wedding? Honestly, your husband can drop out of the wedding and you can block the lot of them for verbally abusing you and being homophobes.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Sorry you are being treated like this.\n\nSide note - this sub has been my guilty pleasure lately and if it\u2019s taught me one thing\u2026 it\u2019s that my S/O and I will 150% be eloping when we get married lol", "NTA, you deserve friends that treat you with respect and treat your marriage with respect, you have every right to be upset and you are def not making it about yourself, MIL made it about your sexuality and marriage. These people are huge AH's and do not deserve your friendship because they are not worthy of you, you deserve so much better.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry you've been treated so badly.  Block them all, lose the \"friend\", and have a fabulous life with your husband and people who care about you.", "ESH. \n\nThey really suck for the usual homophobic wedding drama bullshit.   \nYou suck for screaming at them multiple times and thus tanking the chance to prove it to them that you are a higher moral human being.   \nDon\u2019t yell at people, even when they are being complete and utter arseholes. You catch more flies with honey.", "That was my main issue with the whole situation, was that she didn't tell me herself. I would have still been upset but I would've probably forgiven her if she told me directly.\n\nIt wasn't until the meet up that they brought up the excuse as to why that I realized that it was a bigger issue that I had initially thought. I mean, I fought to keep her in our wedding when we thought she wasn't able to be in it. It just hurt that she couldn't fight to keep me in hers.", "No excuse if this is the case. A true friend would have met up and talked it through, not given in to bigotry and letting OP find out from others. That\u2019s weak and hurtful.\n\nAnd how dare the MIL tell OP\u2019s husband he has no choice but to attend the wedding.\n\nSorry, OP, the friendship is over, do either of you really want to celebrate someone\u2019s love when they deny yours?\n\nNTA but your friend, their partner and MIL are", "Tbh then that just says their morals can be bought for the right price and I wouldn't want that person as my friend either.", "Yes! The MIL is paying for the wedding. I didn't get to mention it in the post. It was also a topic of debate during the whole argument, about how much of the decision was her or her MIL", "I didn't get to completely go in depth on the post, but to answer your question: my husband and other friend didn't tell me because they thought that I should have heard it from her directly. Everyone was under the assumption that she had already had the conversation with me. That's why the cousin even said anything.", "We definitely made sure she was in ours. There was even a point where we were afraid she wasn't going to be attending, so we had to make huge adjustments to make sure she was there. That's why being told that I wasn't going to be in hers struck a huge nerve with me.\n\nTo answer your question, I think so. The MIL has made many comments about how much the wedding will cost. So, I can only assume that she's holding that a leverage.", "I\u2019d say don\u2019t go then. This wedding would be a damned if you, damned if you don\u2019t go situation. Let them keep their drama. I have a feeling your friend might try to apologize later.", "No. Absolutely, categorically denied. People are allowed to be angry when their humanity is belittled. His best friend dumped him for being gay and fem and her family told him his life and existence are against their religion.\n\nThis is poisonous, OP. Don't let it in.", "Yelling was never my intention. I even said that I thought about what I was going to say before I said anything to her. \n\nI got defensive once the MIL decided to call. It really should have been a discussion between me and the friend, not the whole family and church. I definitely could have gone about it another way and not yelled as much but, so could they.", "Their logic is stupid and made no sense. They wanted to bully them into submission and they arent allowed to feel angry? Thats bullshit. People arent robots.\n\nA higher moral human being? They dont treat them like human beings. This is not a competition, its not their responsibility to educate them either.\n\nThis is far beyong being an arsehole. Its dehumanizing and degrading. Its monstrous bigotry. Yelling is the least i would do in this situation.\n\nAnyone with the slightest amount of self esteem would be unable to take this silently. Being a doormat never helps in these cases.", "Completely agree it\u2019s not an excuse.", "I wish I could have said more in the post, but character limit held me back. But, one point of their argument was that they went to our wedding and that they were upset that we couldn't be there to support hers.\n\nI definitely do not feel comfortable being in the situation any longer and I have already let them know that.", " NTA. She is sacrificing your friendship for her dream wedding. Yes yelling is not the best way of resolving conflict but it is understandable when you are hurting and grieving the friendship. Take care and love that your husband is standing by you.", "Unfortunately your \"friend\" is bowing down to her MIL at the cost of your friendship. I'd go have a courthouse wedding before letting someone use money to control me. \nYou should tell your friend:\n\"Look, you can have MILs money or our friendship but you can't have both... what's more important to you?\" \n\nOr\n\nLet your hubby go to the wedding and object to the marriage on grounds of manipulation. Spoil the shit out of it and look MIL dead in the eyes while doing it.", "Even if this is all MILs doing your friend is still in the wrong. You have every right to ask for an explanation. I think you need to talk to your friend without MIL and the couple from the church.", "It doesn't matter, if taking her MIL's money comes with homophobic strings, someone with character would decline, I'd personally rather elope than be beholden to someone like this MIL.", "She still owed you an explanation at the very least not just hiding from tou and hoping you won't notice", "It\u2019s not \u2018her\u2019 dream wedding. It will be her MIL dream wedding.\n\nI feel sorry a bit for the friend. Imagine having your MIL and ~~stooge~~ couple from church showing up to all your wedding conversations and going bananas? Ugh. Friend must be drowning too, I doubt she has a lot of say for real.", "What a true friend would do would be to stand up to hate and not bow down to her MIL homophobia."]}
