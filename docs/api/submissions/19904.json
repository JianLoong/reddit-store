Most of my family know as I posted it a lot on Facebook but the only person who doesn\u2019t is my grandfather.

However, this has really affected my mom who while supportive enough for me does not see the issue for me.\n\nI still decided to go and see but I did not bring my partner just to keep it civil at dinner all my cousins went and at first everything seemed fine. I stuck to the family that actually care about me as to not cause any drama. However, my homophobic aunty decided to bring up my partner while we were eating. I was calm at first but then she started showing off the photos we had took and began talking bad about my relationship and my partner. This started my grandfather to start questioning me then some of my other uncles and aunties. Before I knew it I just blew up at them and I just shouted at them about how they mentioned this on purpose and how I was just sick of every one of their jabs at my life. I was speaking to most people on the table including my grandfather, who seemed shocked but angry at my outburst. After that I just left.\n\nNow I\u2019m being bombarded with all sorts of family members. My mother was pretty upset with me for in her words ruining the dinner and many of my aunts and uncles shared the same opinion. Though speaking with my other cousins they said while it was still tense dinner carried on and it seemed my leaving had no effect rather made some of them feel better.

I'm sure this must be an emotionally difficult situation but I don't blame you at all for putting these boundaries up to your family. And if you don't want to go to your \"grandfather's\" funeral (if he can even be called that after his behavior and attitude towards you) then you don't have to go.", "ETA: OP and fellow redditors, I apologize for my brain not clearly registering a pretty important detail. I don't have the option of striking out what I've written (I'm on mobile) but I would like to put an amended response:\n\nNTA \nYou were pushed past your limit. And your future spouse is lucky that their physical presence or absence doesn't matter when it comes to you speaking up.\n\n---\n\nESH\n\nMy response is a bit different than the NTAs here. Everyone could have done better. The aunt was way out of line. The family that jumped in was out of line. The grandfather is definitely going to hell if that's his priority in the last months of his life. The mom is grieving already but she didn't attack OP so I'm more inclined to give her a little less hate.\n\nBut OP, you knew this could, or most likely would, have happened. If your family is bad enough that you were considering never saying goodbye to this bigot, even if it would make you look better and your mom feel better, you know your family is terrible. You could have been prepared a bit more for guaranteed provocation. When your aunt started, the appropriate answer would have been to call her out on how petty and disgusting she is for doing something she knows makes the grandfather more physically sick when everyone has gathered to say goodbye. Say if you could be tolerant enough of their bigotry to not bring a new family member (despite your beliefs so the grandfather could have one last day all about him), she could certainly avoid the topic. Hell, you could have made a petty jab that he's on his way out, but she doesn't have to make sure he's gone by the end of dinner. Instead of taking the spotlight that was being shined on you as a signal to give a performance, you could have stepped off stage. Your aunt won here. She wanted to hurt you because of her bigotry and make you, as well as all those you identify with, look less than/unworthy/dramatic/horrible. That they are tolerating you and justified in never accepting you. Granted you were provoked but in life we are often provoked where we choose to be the bigger person/take the high road/not dignify with a response (for example, you can't fly off your handle when your boss does something completely disagreeable to you, you have to watch out for yourself and how you come off). And the cousins that can relate? Sounds like they were all silent, so they let you handle it alone. So much for being in the same community if they can't do what even an ally would choose to do.\n\nCongratulations on your engagement though. Wishing you all the best. Soon enough there will be one less shadow being cast on your life.", "Nta. You went to an uncomfortable event to support your mom. You intentionally kept your head down and did everything you could not to let your life take the spotlight or shift the conversation to a place where it could start a fight. Your aunt went out of her way to draw attention to everything you were trying to avoid to start problems. Your aunt is the ah, not you. If anyone reaches out to talk down to you, tell them thwy need to have that conversation withyour aunt, you went out of your way not to start drama, and your aunt went out of her way TO cause drama. This is on her.", "NTA. He and them deserve what they have coming, which will be a close to 0 relationship due to hate. Don't even bother thinking about them.\n\nPS; My dad's mom died (no way we're calling her grandma) and we made a party out of it. We went to a cafe terrace and invited everyone we knew who walked by to a drink (where I'm from cafes serve alcohol). We sang and made jokes. Everyone ended up wasted. Best \"funeral\" ever. Not nice to say but we were actually relieved.", "NTA \n\nYou need to cut your losses. This was your Aunts fault and the fact they disregarded that says everything.", "I\u2019m going to buck the trend and get downvoted into the sub-basement for this. I accept that.\n\nESH. Your aunt is a meddling AH. She knew what she was doing, and it seems like she succeeded.\n\nYour grandfather is from a different time. That\u2019s all well and good, but as a human, it\u2019s incumbent on him to learn and adapt. It\u2019s sad that it seems like he might not before the end of his life, even though it also seems like he wasn\u2019t the cause of this situation.\n\nAnd you because you fell into your Aunt\u2019s trap. Because of this, the last memory you will probably have of your Grandfather is this fight. Identity and self-respect is all well and good, but the man will be gone forever within a few weeks. I think everyone deserves some peace at the end of their life.\n\nEdit: reposted without uncivil word.", "While there is tension, did you really had to tell now your mother that you won't attend the funeral?
