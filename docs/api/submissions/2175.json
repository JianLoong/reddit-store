If she said it was her intention for you to match, I would explain that you're not comfortable matching the bride on her wedding day.\n\nSeparately, I really hope she hasn't been doing this the whole time to \"upstage\" you or prove she looks better in whatever clothes she picks out for you. I'm not saying she does look better, I just hope that isn't her intention.\n\n...I need to know now... the outfits she picks out, do they compliment your body type/complexion or hers?", "NTA but have you bothered to actually talk to her and ask her why she tries to make you match? Maybe her intent isn\u2019t as malicious as you think it is. Perhaps she\u2019s trying to bond with you and be \u201ctwinsies\u201d or something. Or maybe she\u2019s evil but it\u2019s always good to try to communicate about a conflict.", "NTA. No one is required to wear something someone else picked out unless you're committing to an official role in the wedding. I would, however, ask your sister-in-law why she keeps doing this. It can be read in a few ways. It might just be her style, and she recommends it to everyone. She might just be excited to have a sister and wants y'all to dress similarly. Or she's setting you up to look stupid by \"copying\" her. Since she's always been friendly, maybe you give her the benefit of the doubt and talk to her about it.", "Do you know WHY she\u2019s so infatuated with y\u2019all being twins? Do y\u2019all have any issues? Maybe she just likes matching with you. Try opening up a dialogue about why she does this and let her know that you don\u2019t like it for whatever reasons you have and it makes you uncomfortable. Nta", "NTA. What\u2019s her excuse for wanting you to wear it? Does she pick things out for other people too?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow i was about to say something until you mentioned the courthouse wedding, because had it been a regular traditional wedding and she wanted you to wear white.......and she would have worn white....chances are you would've been made a huge fool of. Good on you for thinking quickly and getting a different dress. I'm pretty sure it was sabotage on her part. She knew what she was doing the moment she told you to wear a dress that she knew she was going to wear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtra brownie points for your parents for realizing whats going on.", "NTA.  This is so weird and controlling!  It gives me *Single White Female* vibes.  I could understand if you were her bridesmaid/witness today, but why does she want to match with you other times?  Competition?  I don't get it.", "INFO: Does she have any sisters? It could be that she really admires you and probably considers you as a younger sister. Either way NTA", "NTA. Return dress to her and say you made another choice. It's not normal to expect to dress another adult. I'm avoiding the dressing same thing as I think without that it's weird anyway. Also, that could be that she wants you two to match or something rather than look better than you. Without the same colours thing then you're still NTA cos you, as an adult, don't have to wear what your sister in law prepares for you. If my partner's sister gave me a dress to wear for random event, I'd probably not wear to that event out of principle because I can choose my own clothes.", "I'm not convinced anyone is an AH here.\n\nYou say yourself that she's really friendly and loves picking stuff out for you to wear - I dont think theres any malice here and she probably thought it was a way of bonding.\n\nYou are also free to wear what you want - next time you see her talk about it - be grateful and friendly and I'm sure she will understand.", "TBD...I don't have enough info.  Why do you let someone else dress you if you are not 5 years old.  This could have been avoided with a simple question to her about the matching outfits instead of letting  a 3rd party influence you.", "NTA  \nYour SIL has some sort of issue where you wants you to be \"twinsies\". Always wanted a sister, childhood best friend trauma, something, because this is not normal behavior. The two of you need to talk and get this resolved because if not it is going to screw up your family for years to come.", "The bride seriously picked orange to wear at her own wedding?

While I\u2019d say it\u2019s generally tradition to do as the bride says, it wasn\u2019t a huge wedding so I feel like it\u2019s slightly less big a deal.  Maybe you are misreading this though and making yourself out to always be the AH when she just wants to match with you?", "NTA\nOutside of her, did anyone else wear orange?", "DEF NTA, you probably would have got in shit anyway bc you wore something similar, If not the exact same, as your SIL  on her wedding day", "NTA she sounds pathetic", "NTA. You\u2019re a grown woman capable of picking your own clothing out to your liking. There is no obligation to wear something that someone else helped you choose if you like another look better. \n\nSounds like she wanted you two to be in similar dresses of the same color. .which is really weird to me.", "NTA\n\nI think this is going to be one of those stories when you find out there's a really bizarre reason she wanted to dress alike. Because there's no good reason for wanting that, and certainly no good reason to be offended you didn't wear it.", "NTA it\u2019s weird, usual brides don\u2019t want others in the same colour so they stand out, is she friendly on the outside but secretly resentful, is she attempting a wedge divide, luckily your family are on side, your brother is stuck in middle so can give him some slack for it but am sure deep down he knows was a bad idea to give you a similar dress!\n\nIf does it again when walk in say loudly to her omg girl, why did you choose this for me if you were wearing it, now that\u2019d put the cat among the pigeons \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d\n\nSeriously, decline her offers in the future and if she asks you what are wearing say the total opposite until she gets the hint \ud83d\ude09\n\nVery single white female \ud83e\udee3", "Might be wrong but I think your brother married a low key mean girl.

And she's pissed about that?", "NTA this is an odd thing for SIL to do unless she's a fashion designer by trade. You guys aren't dolls that she can dress up & parade around like marionettes, you're individuals who have your own sense of self & know what you like to wear. It's extremely odd that she likes to match with you too, almost like she wants to be your twin.", "It was your brothers wedding, courthouse or not. For all the times she picked something out for you this was the time to wear it.  Your friend should have minded her own business and stayed out of the wedding your sister in law obviously planned even if it was a small one. YTA . Say no to all the other times, but this one time you should have just done it.", "YTA, you should\u2019ve spoke to her first. if she wanted it that way she wouldn\u2019t have looked at it like you were trying to upstage her at all. it was honestly pretty low to take a third parties opinion instead of have a conversation, after all it was the brides wedding not the other friend.", "YTA. Did you ever ASK why she gets a similar dress? You automatically assume it's to make you look bad. Why? Is she a whole lot prettier and better built than you are? Or could it just be that she is fine with showing up with the same outfit as someone else, and that it makes her feel closer to you as a new relative?  Maybe she just likes to share the neat clothes she found with you. I mean, it's her wedding. This is the one time you should have worn what she picked out unless it was huge, white, and floofy....  Ask her why she picks out the same outfit rather than assuming she's got a problem with it. There's a large portion of the female population that frankly quit caring about it years and years ago and another decently large portion that thinks it's rather neat that someone else has the same taste and we coincidentally had the same outfit...and don't get hung up on comparing how we look to other people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You guys should have talked about the matching clothes before. She shouldn't be surprising you with matching clothes and you should have mentioned that matching made you uncomfortable. But these are both minor transgressions which we all make all the time. \n\nI don't think she'll stay mad at you, but talk about it with her.

When people look at the wedding pictures for years to come, they won't know that she asked you to do \"Twinsies\" looks for her wedding.

She could just think of OP as a sister and want to match. And if the bride says it's fine and in fact wants to match then it's acceptable to match. Problem is she doesn't tell anyone that it's intentional and people may think OP is doing it on purpose to start something.\n\nThis may not be true but it's just an alternate explanation that's also pretty reasonable"]}
