Ask her why she picks out the same outfit rather than assuming she's got a problem with it.

Doesnt matter its not white, other traditions they wear different colours, but the guests dont match with the bride - you just dont do that.", "NTA - did this woman also take your parents asside and instruct them what to wear? or is the behavour directed at you specifically?  does she think she's some kind of wardrobe planner?\n\nYour brother perhaps enjoys this kind of management but she isn't entitled to boss you around.  If you were the bridesmaid, perhaps she'd have an excuse but it was a courthouse wedding.", "YTA\n\nJust be an adult and communicate.

You guys need to talk and if it makes you uncomfortable, tell her.", "This is beyond ridiculous. The bride has no right to tell a guest what to wear to her wedding. NTA.", "NTA Because she didn't have any conversation with you about the dress, just expected you to wear it without question.

Like a small amount of agency earlier on could have headed off this issue at the pass", "She is controlling you. And its time you only decide what you want to wear. A wedding is an exception if you are bridal party or family but any other event wear what you want.", "I think the SIL was setting OP up as looking like a jealous stalker and she\u2019s been doing it for a while now which could be why her family won\u2019t let OP speak to her.

Great idea.", "There certainly is more going on than clothes! One possibility is what you described. Another is what poeadam above said, the \"twinsies\" thing.

And she felt that OP chose to reveal this on one of the biggest days of her life when emotions are running high and she expects her loved ones to be there for her.", "Right so if you wanted your actual sister (not bridesmaid) to match your clothes on your wedding day, which is bizarre in itself, and she didn't, you would make all your family harass her? That is deranged.", "Never ASSUME\u2026 it makes an ASS out of U and ME.", "Well it wasn\u2019t an exact match, but similar - which makes me think she wanted coordinating colors for pictures and not to play twinsies.", "People do weird stuff for weddings all the time. As long as the bride and groom are happy who cares? It's also a simple courthouse wedding so I doubt there was all the usual pomp.\n\nI also love it when people treat unrelated family members like NPCs who can't think for themselves and HAVE to be told how to react by one of the 2 people.\n\nYou really think the bride went to her family and went \"OP refused to wear what I told her to wear, go make hell for it\"?\n\nYou think that's less deranged than wanting to match, feeling upset they didn't match, her family not knowing the whole story and jumping to conclusions because the bride (their daughter, sister, granddaughter, cousin etc) was upset on her own wedding day?", ">why are people so scared of conversation to the point where they internalize and assume what others are thinking and feeling?\n\nThe thing is, that OP isn't scared of the conversation, but *SIL is.*  This isn't an assumption because of the following from the OP:\n\n>I tried to talk to her but her family is keeping me away so I just left.\n\nOP wants to talk about it, but SIL doesn't and got her family to keep OP away from her.  OP has texted her asking to talk about it and SIL hasn't responded.", "Ask that to the bride who glared at OP then sicced her family on OP.", "Clearly she did go to the family and said exactly that. Why would adults attending a wedding be upset about another guest wearing an appropriate dress, instead of wearing exactly what the bride is wearing. She definitely went to them, it's deranged.", "the convo should\u2019ve been before the wedding", "because there was assumptions and no convo before hand lol", "Is it really beyond belief that bride felt upset, someone noticed she felt upset, they asked what's wrong, she said OP didn't wear the dress she picked out, nobody asked OP her PoV before jumping the gun because their loved one was upset? Why do you assume the worst of people when you have no idea on what happened?", "Exactly, no conversation beforehand.   SIL should have clearly and explicitly said that  she wanted to have OP either match or coordinate for photo reasons.  Without that ask and without OP agreeing, OP is free to wear what she wants (especially to avoid matching with the SIL on her wedding day).", "That makes no sense. OP even left a voicemail trying to clear things up and SIL is avoiding it. If it was simply a misunderstanding, why is SIL and her family avoiding OP so hard?", "NTA.

Why in the absolute heck is she ever picking out your clothes?! That\u2019s so odd. And why does everyone think this is normal?! NTA.", "NTA jt sounds like sabotage not a kind gesture", "Idk, her wanting to dress you up is weird. Does she have siblings?, maybe she is overcompensating for never having one. Also unless the wedding had some kind of color code you did nothing wrong. Of course you didn't need to have the same dress but if the bride (bridesmaids etc) wore orange, I could see how that looks bad.", "My wedding dress was in red. My best friend has many beautiful dresses but if she would have asked me to choose one from hers I would have picked the one she wore, which was a different style and red shade (hers was floor length and mine was in front above knees and in the back on the floor). She asked, ASKED, if I would be mad if she wore the dress and if people could get the wrong idea (my reaction made it pretty clear the it was OK for me and my husband was in the loop too) because she was so afraid to do me wrong on my big day. I know without a doubt that I would have spoken with her would I have been the SIL and my friend OP about matching closes (like I did with the MOH/witness from my husband who had a similar dress just shorter and in a different color).\n\nNTA OP, for me it's weird to just tell a person to wear something specific to my wedding without telling the reason why the person should be wearing it. Sure she dress you on normal occasions but a wedding is something different. If she wanted to bond with you she should have told you, if you had a place in the bridal party she should have told you. To just say 'wear that to my wedding', even with the background that she dress you similar in normal occasions, is just weird to me and it makes it totally normal for me to not want to upstage the bride, knowing she had that tendency. In my eyes you did the right thing, at least in wearing something different.\nBut you really should have talked about it with her the moment she just chose a dress you should wear to her wedding.", "NTA, the fact that she\u2019s done this multiple times tells me that this isn\u2019t a coincidence. She totally wanted you to wear that specific dress to set you up and make you look bad. She\u2019s only mad because you didn\u2019t fall into her trap. She sounds demented.", "NTA, but definitely could have been handled better. Seems like you need to get to the root of the issue. It seems that the SIL likes to play dress up and coordinate colors and looks with you. Maybe she is doing that because she likes you enough to want to be twins. It might not be about trying to make you look like you\u2019re copying her or don\u2019t look as good as her. \n\nMy next question. This was a wedding. Granted a courthouse wedding, but still a wedding. Did she have a wedding theme in mind that she wanted everyone to wear to coordinate her wedding. Especially since she has a history of playing dress up with you. This might be her way of showing affection and acceptance to you, so not wearing what she picked out could have been felt like a rejection and hurt her feelings. \n\nI think this could have been avoided if you simply had asked a few simple, non defensive questions.  Why do you dress us up in matching clothes? What are you wearing? Are you sure you want me to wear a similar dress when you\u2019re the bride, I don\u2019t want to take any of the attention away from you\u2026Just like \u201cnever wearing white to a wedding\u201d, is a must live by rule, but that rule is irrelevant if the bride wants you to wear white or gives her blessing. Orange is the same concept. \n\nThis may have just been a big misunderstanding that could have been avoided if you just had a conversation and got some clarification before the wedding. It also sounds like you might have some issues with playing dress up with your SIL and that should have been addressed sooner than this, but the wedding itself was definitely the wrong time to make the stand.", "NTA\n\nThe only people I know who get their clothes picked out for them on a regular basis like this are under the age of five.\n\nEdit to add, with their bizarre reaction did they even give you a chance to say anything about the change of dress? How do they know you didn\u2019t spill something on the orange one at the last minute?  What weird behavior, at least based on what you\u2019ve posted so far.", "NTA i feel like instead of trying to copy you, it seems as she is like in love with you \u00bf?", "For a clumsy fool like me this is likely to be the truth so I\u2019d be devastated if I had to make a last minute change and ran into such a bizarre reaction from the bride, her family and my own brother.  This is Twilight Zone weird.", "That's not on her to read something that nuanced into clothes. That's on the SIL to express. OP is her own person and shouldn't have to worry about offending someone because she dressed herself.", "The problem with that is she didn\u2019t know ahead of time the bride was going to choose orange. I mean, who even expects a bride to choose orange even for a court wedding?  The color change could have better been explained by a last minute mishap and a quick change. It\u2019s a little white lie but apparently necessary to keep the peace with these people and the strange situation. If there was a specific reason a dress had to specifically be orange for an informal wedding then OP should have been told what it was at the outset.", "All the times it has happened so far it hasn't been big deals, like a family dinner or get-togethers.\n\nI don't really care for fashion so I really didn't care. Family didn't seem to care either, no rumors or gossip. I just know you don't wear the brides colors at a wedding and didn't want to risk it.", "And if she doesn't want to match her SIL? Shouldn't that be her choice?", "You really should have told her before the wedding what you were going to do. Hell, you should have told her the first time it bothered you, or any of the times since. But give her space for now, she got married today!", "This is how she controls. Just say no.", "Yeah it sounds like they didn\u2019t even let her have a chance to explain. I know so many people who have had to make last minute clothing changes due to a rip or spill.  When the brother was reaming her out I wonder if he thought to even ASK what happened. OP doesn\u2019t say. \n\nIf nobody even asked about the change, that strikes me as strange.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s also perfectly reasonable for OP to say she tried the orange and realized it clashed badly with her coloring.  Not everyone can wear orange.", "Yup of course it is, I\u2019m suggesting that it sounds like it could be a matter of perspective.", "It wasn\u2019t the SIL\u2019s friend that told OP, it was OP\u2019s friend who reminded her that SIL has done this in the past. It seems like SIL wanted a reason to be upset or be catty about OP trying to \u201cwear the same thing as the bride\u201d", "If she wants to match as a sisterly thing then why isn\u2019t she communicating that to OP? I have sisters, if they want us to match they say so. Doing it once to match in a sisterly way without telling OP is understandable, doing it constantly is not sisterly. The lack of communication that this is a sisterly closeness she is trying to achieve says that closeness is not her objective."]}
