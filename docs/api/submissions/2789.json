My house is in a warm location near beaches so everyone in the family is excited to get out of the cold and dig their toes into sand. My family is large and as expected, we all fall under different parts of the political spectrum. We might not agree with each other on some issues but we treat each other with respect and love. That is, except for my sister Kari and her husband Bob. \n\nThey strongly believe in their politics and view anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with them as being wrong and need to be taught to be correct. Even family members who are in the same political party are wrong if they\u2019re not in 100% agreement on every issue. Every get together turns into a heated debate with them on one side against everyone else even with the people who vote as they do. Frankly, it\u2019s exhausting and life draining just to be in the same room with them.\n\nTo head off any political debate this year, I included in the invitation email a ban on political discussions and a request for a monetary deposit of $500 (I picked this amount because everyone can afford it but I wanted it to be a painful loss if they lose it). I stated that this money will be returned at the end of the night if politics are not discussed. Whoever brings up politics will lose their deposit. Everyone agreed and sent me the money except for Kari and Bob. They replied that this was stupid and they don\u2019t have to pay a deposit to come to a family gathering. I answered since it\u2019s my house, it\u2019s my rules. We went back and forth until I got tired of it and uninvited them. \n\nI\u2019m here because they have children who will be affected by my decision and my parents are trying to talk me out of it. They want to see all of their grand children and they think it\u2019s cruel to prevent Kari\u2019s from coming. They even offered to cover Kari\u2019s deposit but I firmly told them no. \n\nAITA for requiring a deposit to come to TG?", "created_utc": 1668947444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z02ypf/aita_for_requiring_a_cash_deposit_to_come_to_tg/", "score": 940, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then they can know then funded someone they oppose.", "NTA great rule I may have to implement it myself! It\u2019s not like you\u2019re taking the money and there\u2019s obviously a legitimate reason trying to avoid conflict so if that makes them not want to come they were clearly going to stir shit up anyways.", "NTA \n\nGenius!!! Bob & Kari are adults & get to decide for themselves. You are not accountable for their choices or actions. Kari will need to explain to her kids & to your Mom why she is choosing politics over family\n\nETA \u2014 for the time & energy I have put in to this post I feel I should be invited to this warm place holiday feast! LOL ... this will absolutely need an update. Wishing you & yours a very Peaceful Thanksgiving!", "Ahhhhh politics and religion, 2 things that shouldn't be discussed at large family gatherings! I applaud your solution and to really make the penalty hurt, donate the $500 to their least favourite charity! NTA", "NTA\n\nI love the idea. I would suggest donating the money to a charity if someone doesn\u2019t follow through. Unfortunately, it\u2019s becoming increasingly popular for people to feel the need to force their political views on others. It\u2019s a family holiday gathering. Why not just enjoy the company of loved ones you don\u2019t see often without causing drama, arguments, and fights over something that is no one else\u2019s business. \n\nStick to your guns and do not have them come. There is no reason to ruin get together because they\u2019re whole identity is their political beliefs. It\u2019s okay to be a human and not have your whole identity wrapped up in something as divisive as politics. It doesn\u2019t matter which party they support, all the bickering is ridiculous. They\u2019re trying to further an agenda that allows the rich to continue to profit off the populace. That applies to both parties and that\u2019s not even trying to make this political. Politicians from any party stack wealth while in office. \n\nUnfortunately politics is treated more as fandom than anything. It\u2019s like having relatives argue over the Cowboys and Eagles at a family get together. No one wants to hear that. Be interested in the family that\u2019s there that you don\u2019t see often. Just in case something ever happened, I\u2019d prefer my last thoughts to be positive as opposed to an argument over something that really isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business.", "NTA.  This idea is ingenious!  Asking for a deposit, that can be returned, seems like a fantastic, and very new idea.\n\nLike you, I have a brother and SIL who disagree violently about politics with almost everyone i our family.  We cannot even mention politicians' names, or even make a comment that might slightly reference our politics since 2016.  Our family is smaller and no one enjoys a debate/argument, so we get away with a few dirty looks and snide comments.  Often I wade into the conversation with a \"Time for a Topic Change!\" and then suggest something painfully safe.. like the weather, or our local zoo, or heck anything.\n\nIt sounds like you have a perfect plan to keep the conversations non-confrontational.  This is also excellent for all the children involved.  What kids need to see relatives in all-out arguments about politics?\n\nNTA for putting family peace first.", "If your parents cover this deposit you will get political debate. The reason everyone else agreed to pay is because they are exhausted by your sister and her husband. Because this is a pretty bizarre request, let's be honest. Only to stave off assholes would you not baulk at this. Your sister and BIL are the ones depriving the children of TG with family because of their obnoxious behaviour. Your parents will have to suck that up. Or bring the kids alone and give the parents a \"break.\" NTA", "NTA. This is brilliant honestly. If your mom needs them there, she can front the money and address her kid. I hope that $500 goes to a shelter nearby. Beach communities are disproportionately affected by homelessness in some cases since it doesn\u2019t get so cold.", "NTA. Actually that's pretty reasonable and good incentive not to discuss politics. If they can't afford it I would understand but then like, you just negotiate amounts.", "NTA. Your parents can go visit them if it\u2019s so important to see the grandkids. The peaceful interaction of your TG will be worth the sacrifice of Kari and Bob. Enjoy dude", "So who gets to keep the money if someone does go there talking about politics?? Not sure what TG means. Would that answer my question?", "I think this is an AH move TBH, though I\u2019m very sympathetic to wanting to avoid politics at thanksgiving.", "I'm leaning towards NTA\n\nI personally think the amount of money is too much,  and would never pay it (not even for a deposit), although I hate political debates during family holidays. Too much of a controlling move for me personally.\n\nHowever, the fact that EVERYONE else eagerly paid it shows that you had a real problem with your sister, and everyone in the family was already fed up with her.", "NTA. I think some might take exception with the deposit idea, but that's not the issue anyway, it's Kari & Bob's refusal to agree not to discuss politics. Frankly even if they did proffer the deposit I'm pretty sure they'd wax eloquent, then call you AH when they forfeit it. I just don't think it would effective with people that full of themselves.", "NTA but a great decision \ud83d\udc4d I will copy that for my Christmas get together", "NTA. Donate the losses to charity, tell them if they don't get involved you'll donate to the opposing political party and if they do you'll donate it to homeless people or a pet shelter.", "Nta it sounds like no one else has a problem with it because they know they\u2019re not gonna lose anything. K and B are just using the deposit as an excuse because they want to continue being combative. That being said, you could also just as easily make a rule that anyone that starts a political conversation will immediately be asked to leave. Im sure those who have no issues with the deposit will agree while those two will still have some kind of issue.", "NTA - Your house. Your rules.", "Why not just exclude Kari and Bob from Thanksgiving?  What an odd way to handle things.  YTA for making things unnecessarily complicated.", "NTA, Kari and Bob obviously can\u2019t take the hint that the debate is only interesting for them.  If your parents do cover, remind Kari and Bob that any political discussion will result in a forfeiture. Remind the rest of your guests.  Have a charity picked out that the money will be donated to.  If anyone tries to debate firmly shut it down, tell them to take it outside, and remind them you will be giving them the receipt for their charitable donation if they continue.", "NTA but if you have gotten to the point of fining them if they wont stop the subject of politics... do you really want them there?", "Coming from a family so tumultuous that major appliances have been thrown down the stairs during \u201cdiscussions,\u201d I applaud your efforts to keep the peace.  The only way a person would take issue with a place-nice deposit would be if they had zero intention of doing so. NTA.", "NTA and this is brilliant. If we still hosted I would totally steal this idea. In your case I would let your parents pay the deposit though and I'd probably say that any forfeited deposits will be donated to the opposing party of the person who lost their deposit. So if they are super conservative I'd donate it to the most liberal Democrat group I could find and vice versa. Seriously amazing plan.", "Your house your rules.  As for the children that's not your concern that's the parents selfish WAYS  affecting them and won't be the last.  It was nice of your d dad to offer the deposit, but you can't allow bullies opportunities to bully.\n\nHave a peaceful holiday with your family\n\n\nNTA", "NTA.

And their refusal to pay it is a definite indicator they think they are above rules. If you parents are so upset they can pay the fine every time the entitled blowhards spout off!", "this is so weird and tacky and inappropriate to put a financial barrier on who can come to your Thanksgiving dinner, i get why you're doing it but i seriously cannot imagine anyone going along with this", "I understand not wanting people to talk politics but a $500 retainer for thanksgiving is so tacky.", "NTA and put the use of the money (to be shared with the rest of the civil guests) via EDIT into your post.\n\nYou really found a nice and easy way to keep thanksgiving clean!

You wouldn't allow Kari's mom to pay for her so I have to assume that the same rule applies to everyone else?\n\nWhat if you have a very rich relative who gives you the $500 and happily talks politics all night? Are you going to take their money and let them continue talking or are you going to kick them out? \n\nWho exactly is being asked to pay? Everyone over the age of 18? Do couples have to pay $1,000?

If it was my kid, I'd tell them to pay up and stop talking politics.", ">They even offered to cover Kari\u2019s deposit but I firmly told them no.\n\nIf you do this, be prepared for them to only talk about politics just to make a point (they sound like the kind of people who would do that). Same if you remove this rule now.\n\nIt is sad for the children though, but I don't see a solution for them. Even if they're at an age where travelling alone (or with other family) would be possible, I doubt Kari and Bob would allow it. Hopefully if you hold strong, this is a lesson they'll only need to learn once, and next year they'll pay the deposit.", ">They want to see all of their grand children\n\nThat's unfortunate for them.

Small price for her to pay to yap about politics while everone else can't.\n\n>What if you have a very rich relative who gives you the $500 and happily talks politics all night?\n\nConsidering it's only Kari and their family that apparently causes problems, this question seems pointless.

Do you keep everyone's money?\n\nIf you smash the walls of your apartment before leaving, will the landlord keep your security deposit?

No one coming is poor or rich. We\u2019re also close so I basically know their financial situation so I know they can afford to deposit $500 and I was correct since they all did. The $500 covers the family (mom, dad, kids, etc). The minors attending are young and not interested in politics. They\u2019ve never talked and it before and there\u2019s little chance they will now.

Lots of folks think of that as a political issue when it's only political because we've made it such. What about healthcare? If I'm talking about a health issue and how I wish there was universal healthcare, am I going to get a fine? \n\nAlso, who is tracking this?

I'm asking if that is a universal rule.\n\nI think you need to understand that I'm also asking this question for all the people who think this is a good idea. Everyone seems to think it's the bee's knees without actually considering some of the consequences. Let me put it this way, what if Kari wins the lottery and decides that $500 is a perfectly reasonable fee for her to say whatever she wants at that meal? If she makes the deposit, is she actually allowed to say whatever she wants or will she be kicked out, shunned, etc. Because the problem I see here is not that people don't pay enough to speak but rather that one person in particular is speaking about something that OP finds uncomfortable. If paying the deposit isn't going to stop her from speaking then isn't the deposit pointless and unnecessary for everyone else? It doesn't stop the problem it just ensures that only rich people can pay to make a problem.\n\nSo, a single person would pay the same amount as a large family with lots of adult children who happen to live at home? Doesn't quite seem fair to the single person who has to pay the full amount when the family can pool their money, each individually paying much less. \n\nWhy would it be different? Um, because family is not a business and having rigid and extreme rules that you don't apply to everyone is pretty manipulative? And, just so I'm clear, you're saying that OP would and should keep thousands or tens of thousands of dollars from her family because they decided not to follow her rules for one meal? And, everyone here thinks that's a great idea? \n\nI don't think shushing a teen who's interested in politics is very effective.", "who's going to find you here you said your family is on board with the plan", "It proves the insanity of this place thinking charging people 500 dollars to go to a family dinner is normal.

I love OP\u2019s idea & effort but you can\u2019t control other people so let the games begin!!", "I\u2019m not ignoring anything.... it\u2019s not my party. I do not know these people. IMO I believe she has a good plan for what she is trying to accomplish, however I think it\u2019s just common sense understanding that no one can control other people. You could come up with every \u201cwhat if, what about\u201d scenario & still not be able to predict how this will all work out. So this plan could fail miserably or be a wonderful success. It\u2019s up to the people who are attending. So.... Unless your attending OP\u2019s family dinner & need more clarification of how to behave, how she handles any of the \u201cflaws\u201d you have mentioned is her problem to deal with, not yours. If you or anyone here wants to use this idea for your family gatherings, then make up your own rules that will work for your family. Otherwise, either you think she\u2019s an AH or not based on the information she provided."]}
