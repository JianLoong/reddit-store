It's been only us ever since my husband passed away in a car accident five years ago. Losing him was very hard, but we have slowly been able to come to terms with it.\n\nLately, Anna has picked up the habit of wearing her dad's clothes. Nothing much, just things like hoodies and some shirts of his. I don't mind, because it's a good way for her to keep her father close and she doesn't look weird in them\n\nLast week there was a family gathering at my mom's house. Anna went wearing one of her dad's old shirts and a pair of jeans shorts. When we got there we said hi to everyone together, then she went to hang out with my nieces and i stuck with the adults\n\nWhile I was talking to my sister, one of my cousins Beatrice (45f),decided to butt in the conversation to talk about the way Anna was dressed. Beatrice is, for the lack of better terms, a bitch that uses her religion as a way to mind other people's business, so that did not surprise me, but it still annoyed me. She has 5 kids (One son and four daughters), so she thinks she's the best person to give parenting advice in the entire family\n\nShe went on a whole spiel about how I'm a bad mother and how I should stop Anna from wearing male clothes because that would result in her ending up as a Lesbian or worse, it could be a way for her to adhere to transgenderism while under my roof. Now, i wouldn't care if my daughter was gay, or a son, but like hell am i allowing someone to say that shit about her just from the way she dresses\n\nI just sort of snapped and told her \"Look, who's talking about being a bad mother, isn't your son a bum? Didn't all of your daughters run off just to get away from your annoying ass and shitty parenting? Better a gay kid than whatever the hell you got going on.You're the last person i want any advice from, stay in your lane,\" plus a bunch of other things i can't remember right now because i was that mad\n\nAs y'all can imagine she didn't like that, she started crying then left. Now i'm getting flack from some people in her side of the family for being so mean to her, because even if what i said is true i shouldn't have snapped at her like that when she was just being concerned about me and my kid, when i know she's been having a hard time with her family and that i should apologize, now i'm wondering if i'm in the wrong here\n\nSo, aita?", "created_utc": 1679504647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ypbor/aita_for_calling_my_cousin_a_bad_parent_and/", "score": 539, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
