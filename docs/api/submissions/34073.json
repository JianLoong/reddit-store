Do now waste one second of your life worrying about what they think.\n\nIt's like worrying about what your ex-MIL thinks of you.", "NTA. If they don't want your business, that is their problem. They want the financing because they can make money off the interest and I'm sure the salespeople get bigger commissions. And you being willing to walk out if they didn't give you want you wanted is a completely legitimate negotiation tactic. So, yes, paying cash up front is 100% your choice, and, yes, this is one of those sneaky dealership tactics.", "The dealer makes additional money off of financing.    Dealers are hard up enough for sales, that if you threaten to walk, I'm sure they'd accommodate you.", "NTA The dealerships have added pressure to move cars at the end of the month. I have walked out of more than one dealership when the salesman and the sales manager try to start silly nonsense. It doesn't matter to me if someone gets a commission, I'll find a place that will sell me what I want on my terms.", "NTA, dealerships get a small amount of the finance deal profit. A lot of the time this amount factors strongly into the sale price for them.

They make less money when you pay cash but you absolutely have the right to do so. Yes, it\u2019s a sneaky dealership tactic!

Even if it would be a crime.", "NTA, but they get kick backs from the financing companies, that's why they wanted you to finance at least some of it.", "NTA - they get more of a commission if you finance through them.

As others have mentioned, dealerships get profit from the financing companies.  The dealer will get a rate from the bank (the \u201cbuy\u201d rate) and then sell that financing to you at a markup (the \u201ccontract\u201d rate).  As car prices have increased, this financing profit has become a larger part of dealership profits. \n\nIn the future, it might get to the point that a dealer might refuse to sell a car without financing.  In that case, read the financing contract very carefully.  The vast majority have no penalty for early/prepayment.  In that case , go ahead and sign the financing contract, wait two weeks then call the financing company for the \u201cpayoff.\u201d  This will be the totall amount financed plus a very small amount of accrued interest.  You then pay the whole thing off and enjoy your car.  The dealership, which has already been paid the total amount of financing profit up front from the bank, will have that amount \u201ccharged back.\u201d  And they will be very salty.  \n\nThis is why some dealerships ask customers not to pay off loans until three months have passed.  \u201cIt would really help us out if\u2026.\u201d   After three months they can\u2019t be charged back.  But there\u2019s no reason for you to do that, it would be more interest charges to you.  \n\nSource:  I used to be a finance manager at an Acura dealership a long time ago.", "Needed the reassurance. I\u2019ll be honest that it was the weirdest car buying experience I have ever had.", "I lol\u2019d.", "LOL I left my reading glasses in the other room and I thought your response read \"kick balls\" not \"kick backs\"...", "Salesmen are motivated by the incentives that enhance their commission like getting you to fiance with their preferred credit company. I am sure the look on their face was priceless when you said okay, I'll keep looking. The internet levelled the playing field with car sales, some dealerships haven't quite caught on yet.", "LOL, well, kick balls would not have left the salesmen so hot and heavy to get it.", "Nta - they gave you a hard time because the financing company makes money when you finance or lease", "NTA. My husband & I have paid in full by check for the last 2 cars we\u2019ve bought. (Probably makes it sound like we\u2019re rich, but one was covered by severance pay from a job layoff where we had to return 2 company cars -ouch- and the other was  cash-out from refinancing our mortgage a few years ago)  ANYWAY- it\u2019s totally fine, and not unusual. And it\u2019s awesome to not have a car payment!", "No, you are NOT wrong (or TA!) for paying cash for a car; my husband and I did exactly the same thing (and our dealership did NOT give us a hard time about it!) The dealership will make more money if they can stretch out your payments, but that only profits them - not you.\n\nYou are NTA, and your dealership was very, very foolish to have antagonized you the way they did! If they'd been more sensible, they'd have realized that hassling a customer is a good way to LOSE that customer now, get NO repeat business from them in the future AND get a scathing review from them on Yelp. Congrats on your new car and please ignore what those boneheaded car dealers said!", "NTA - but dealerships sell loans, not cars.  This is why they were upset", "NTA but getting a car at MSRP right now actually is a deal", "NAH\n\nThe financing is part of the negotiations and where most of the dealership's margin is. Paying cash kills that margin and coming in with that is a surprise to them. It's reasonable that they would want to renegotiate to get that profit margin back, and you're not TA for holding them to their previous quote.", "NTA. Go ahead and \"finance\" the car to get the incentives, make sure there's no prepayment penalty, then pay it off when your first payment is due.", "These were posted on a tech subreddit some years ago, and is quite a rollercoaster: [Tales from a dishonest Used Car Dealership](https://aroundincircles.net/tales-from-a-dishonest-used-car-dealership-stories/)", "\ud83c\udfafperfection. I absolutely detest buying cars. Doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m an elderly woman, but it\u2019s been a sucky experience since I bought my first car a beat up \u201857 Volvo from a guy who treated me like an incompetent child who couldn\u2019t drive a stick or use a choke. \n\nNow, I have never ever not once financed a vehicle. I drove beaters until I could afford a better car. I\u2019m fortunate now, retired, and can pay cash for what I want. \n\nLast time I went to buy a very expensive late model used car as a special treat to myself, I went in completely educated, knowing exactly what I was looking for and I started by saying \u201cthis car is what I want, this is what I\u2019m wanting to spend and I\u2019m telling you right now, if you pull any kind of hard sell, I will walk and that\u2019s a promise. Also, I\u2019m paying cash\u201d. \n\nHe didn\u2019t seem interested in what I knew I could easily find *somewhere* in the Bay Area if not at this large dealership and of course was trying to sell me something else, knowing I had money. Whatever, I\u2019ll tolerate your obnoxious zygote ass - but the *second* he asked me about calling my motherfucking husband for a \u201cmore workable\u201d price point, I scolded the hell out him very loudly and specifically so all in earshot could hear and absolutely kept my promise. \n\nThis was like 5 years ago. My cousin,  a 60+ year old tattooed up biker/ \u201ccar guy\u201d found my vehicle elsewhere and got me the deal I was looking for. I\u2019m done buying cars myself. Done. \n\nI would have loved to have somehow fucked with that first guy. Thanks for the tip, for sure, you never know\u2026\u2026!", "Thank you for introducing me to this account of hilarity."]}
