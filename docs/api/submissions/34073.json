Do now waste one second of your life worrying about what they think.\n\nIt's like worrying about what your ex-MIL thinks of you.", "NTA. If they don't want your business, that is their problem. They want the financing because they can make money off the interest and I'm sure the salespeople get bigger commissions. And you being willing to walk out if they didn't give you want you wanted is a completely legitimate negotiation tactic. So, yes, paying cash up front is 100% your choice, and, yes, this is one of those sneaky dealership tactics.", "The dealer makes additional money off of financing.    Dealers are hard up enough for sales, that if you threaten to walk, I'm sure they'd accommodate you.", "NTA The dealerships have added pressure to move cars at the end of the month. I have walked out of more than one dealership when the salesman and the sales manager try to start silly nonsense. It doesn't matter to me if someone gets a commission, I'll find a place that will sell me what I want on my terms.", "NTA, dealerships get a small amount of the finance deal profit. A lot of the time this amount factors strongly into the sale price for them. If they had know from the start you were a cash buyer they probably would have upped the price somehow.\n\nWhat you did was absolutely fine and quite common. They just didn\u2019t get as much profit from you as they probably wanted.", "NTA More dealership tactics. They make money off the financing so can sell the car for less & make it up in interest payments. Regardless, they didn\u2019t lose any money on the deal.", "NTA. Hold firm. They make less money when you pay cash but you absolutely have the right to do so. Yes, it\u2019s a sneaky dealership tactic! Those cads.", "NTA.\nAnything that you will do at the dealership never would be TA. Even if it would be a crime.", "NTA, but they get kick backs from the financing companies, that's why they wanted you to finance at least some of it.", "NTA - they get more of a commission if you finance through them. Dealerships are just for marketing and really a scam that increases the cost by 30-40%.", "NTA. You\u2019re a paying customer, and you had the financial resources to pay in full.

As others have mentioned, dealerships get profit from the financing companies.  The dealer will get a rate from the bank (the \u201cbuy\u201d rate) and then sell that financing to you at a markup (the \u201ccontract\u201d rate).  As car prices have increased, this financing profit has become a larger part of dealership profits. \n\nIn the future, it might get to the point that a dealer might refuse to sell a car without financing.  In that case, read the financing contract very carefully.  The vast majority have no penalty for early/prepayment.  In that case , go ahead and sign the financing contract, wait two weeks then call the financing company for the \u201cpayoff.\u201d  This will be the totall amount financed plus a very small amount of accrued interest.  You then pay the whole thing off and enjoy your car.  The dealership, which has already been paid the total amount of financing profit up front from the bank, will have that amount \u201ccharged back.\u201d  And they will be very salty.  \n\nThis is why some dealerships ask customers not to pay off loans until three months have passed.  \u201cIt would really help us out if\u2026.\u201d   After three months they can\u2019t be charged back.  But there\u2019s no reason for you to do that, it would be more interest charges to you.  \n\nSource:  I used to be a finance manager at an Acura dealership a long time ago.", "Needed the reassurance. I\u2019ll be honest that it was the weirdest car buying experience I have ever had.", "I lol\u2019d.", "LOL I left my reading glasses in the other room and I thought your response read \"kick balls\" not \"kick backs\"...", "Salesmen are motivated by the incentives that enhance their commission like getting you to fiance with their preferred credit company. I am sure the look on their face was priceless when you said okay, I'll keep looking. The internet levelled the playing field with car sales, some dealerships haven't quite caught on yet.", "LOL, well, kick balls would not have left the salesmen so hot and heavy to get it."]}
