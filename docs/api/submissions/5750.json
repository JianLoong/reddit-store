She has the right to feel her feelings and remove herself from a painful situation. \n\nWhat type of person she is has no bearing on this. If it does, you're an unnecessarily cruel person.\n\nYou could've done this in a phone call or in person at a different time, or at the very least given your SIL a heads up. You had other options, which wouldn't have reminded your SIL of 6 entire lifetimes of love that she will never experience.", "YTA\n\nIt's common courtesy to give people who you know will struggle with the announcement a private heads up. How did you talk about this announcement in length and not figure that out? Of course she is going to be hit by a tsunami of pain when she sees your announcement on a t-shirt, for crying out loud.\n\nHad she known, she could have decided not to come or asked you to announce before she arrived so she wouldn't have to be part of all the fuss and could just enjoy Christmas dinner. \n\nOr you could have just done your 'fun' announcement when you were alone with your parents on any other day and called your SIL afterwards. There are so many options that show that you care about her feelings. She is right to be mad, because you've demonstrated that you don't care.", "I\u2019m torn between Y-TA and E-SH. You could have done this a lot more sensitively. Instead you chose to do it in a dramatic, everyone scream and shout way. A big out of the blue and no way to escape giving a raw reaction way. You should have had a quiet word with them and either delayed your announcement to a special meal with just your parents or allowed your sibling and SIL to excuse themselves/hang back a bit. These situations are complicated and nuanced. SIL needs to be reasonable but it could not have hurt you guys or diminished your announcement in the least if you had shown just a little consideration. You forced them into an experience you knew would be painful for them.", "You\u2019re going to get particular responses here from people who probably mostly don\u2019t have kids and haven\u2019t had a miscarriage.\n\nBut if you posted in a pregnancy forum the advice you would have received pretty universally would have been to at least give SIL and brother a private heads up rather than blindsiding them on Christmas with your celebration T-shirts.\n\nI\u2019m sure you have no idea what it is like to have a miscarriage, to go through the physical and mental anguish that goes along with it. \n\nIn general I think announcing at Christmas is kind of tacky because it\u2019s a family holiday and it\u2019s not all about you and IMO it\u2019s kind of shitty to pull all focus to yourselves even if we don\u2019t touch the fact that your SIL has had 6 miscarriages. \n\nBut when you add that fact in along with the fact that you couldn\u2019t even give her a heads up so she could choose not to come or go in better prepared, for me this is a clear YTA.", "Oooh, I'm going to swim against the stream with ESH.\n\nSIL needs serious therapy, but she isn't wrong to feel her feelings.  And you WERE insensitive. \n\nI don't think you were malicious, so I can't go full YTA. But you discussed it beforehand, you both knew it would hurt her, and you did it anyway.\n\nIn a situation that delicate, a call or text to her,  or some other communication would have been more appropriate.  You're excited and deserve your moment in the sun.

Nothing more, nothing less. It's very kind to do so. \n\nSo I guess I think YTA because of this, not because It was announced at Christmas or because SIL had miscarriages.", "You should have warned the family members who had six of their babies die. YTA.  SIL is acting over the top and full on but she is also in immense pain because you shocked her with a very sensitive topic instead of forewarning her. And for the record, I got a puppy after my miscarriage too and it wasn\u2019t for attention but just to hold a little life once more. You\u2019ve obviously never experienced this sort of loss.", "\u201cSo we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.\u201d\n\nYeah, you were gloating.

But I do agree with your SIL. I think this is a common mistake people make. They are so worried about other peoples grief they make assumptions. I do agree with the SIL that they should have gotten a heads up. As someone who has had miscarriages- it doesn\u2019t feel great when people are walking on eggshells for you. But I also get that (maybe) you haven\u2019t experienced this kind of loss - so you\u2019d have no idea. \n\nI think you just apologize and hopefully she (SIL) can move on.

All of her behavior screams \u201cunhinged\u201d. I feel bad for her but that\u2019s a lot of trauma dumping to aggressively hostile text someone about \u201c6 dead children\u201d. That\u2019s disturbing to hear that. Also she definitely wouldn\u2019t have been happy for you if you texted her before Christmas. It just would\u2019ve been a different reason she was upset! Because it\u2019s not about the timing or the heads up\u2026 it\u2019s just that you guys are pregnant and she\u2019s not. I hope you can encourage your brother to get her help. Congrats on your baby", "YTA.\n\nYour SIL needs help, clearly. Her own infertility issues do not mean you have to tamp down your own joy. \n\nBut you were extremely insensitive, bordering on cruel, popping that on her with no warning in a group setting. You should have told her privately beforehand so it didn't hit her like a Mack truck with other people watching.", "It wasn\u2019t wrong to announce it. But YTA because SIL is right, you were insensitive because you could have given a heads up. It seems like you know this because  you attempt to justify your actions by bad talking you sil in the beginning of your post.", "Yta.  Should have let her know privately first before announcing to everyone. \nA text the week before would have given her enough notice to get her mask in place.", "YTA.\n\nYour SIL (and presumably your brother; why isn\u2019t he factored into this) is always going to be upset over pregnancy announcements, even if she\u2019s happy for the parents to be.\n\nAll you owed her and your brother was a little heads up and an opportunity for them to process your news privately first. That way they could at least grieve their losses and then put on a happier face in front of the whole family.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do that, so I might have made an E S H judgment, EXCEPT THAT YOU MADE BABY ANNOUNCEMENT T-SHIRTS AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS. That is such an A-Hole move under the circumstances. Like, wow.", "ESH. \n\nWhen publicly announcing a pregnancy in the presence of someone suffering from infertility, the kind and compassionate thing to do is give them a heads up and let them know what\u2019s coming so they could decide if they want to present for the announcement. A call or text a day or two ahead would suffice. Or pick a time when they\u2019re not present and then tell them privately after the fact if you\u2019re worried about them ruining the surprise. You say you and your wife discussed how to go about it in regards to your SIL, but it seems you just decided to disregard her feelings completely. I understand you\u2019re fed up with her attention seeking behavior but 6 miscarriages is a lot of grief and heartbreak and your brother suffered those loses as well. Couldn\u2019t you have at least taken his pain into consideration? \n\nIf SIL truly acts how you describe then she sucks for that. If the text was just an airing of grievances and explaining why she and your brother were hurt, I\u2019d say no big deal but she\u2019s taking a pretty hostile tone towards your wife and it comes off as more of an attack. I understand she\u2019s hurt but she could have said she was happy for you but the announcement brought up a lot of difficult feelings for her and she would have appreciated a heads up.", "YTA. It would have cost $0 and 2 minutes of your time to send SIL a heads up text.", "YTA. Compassion and kindness are free. If you were in her shoes how would you have wanted to be treated. You have every right to announce your baby any way you want. No one can dictate how you announce your pregnancy but a world full of \u2018 I\u2019ll get mine first\u2019, isn\u2019t the one you should want your child to enter into. Your SILs response was not even cruel or mean, just a heartfelt expression of the pain caused. You are here because you know you handled this badly.", "YTA. Anyone who knows anyone who is dealing with infertility (and multiple dead children) knows that the best way to share this type of news is in a way that allows the person to process in private. They can be happy for you but also absolutely fucking devastated for themselves.\n\nThe sensitive thing would have been to call or message them the day before with the news so they could process in private and decide if they could be a positive addition to the celebration. \n\nYou just decided to sideswipe them in the middle of a family celebration. Not cool. Congratulations on your pregnancy OP, but please be more sensitive to people who may have to work through complicated personal emotions in order to celebrate your baby.", "YTA. If your family didn't have someone in it who has buried 6 kids trying to have a baby then this kind of public announcement might be ok. But given the context, it's inconsiderate at best. I don't get the need to make an \"event\" of it. Tell the people who need to know privately and take off the pressure of the \"big public scene\" aspect.", "This is a rough one all around. BUT, knowing that this is a very sensitive issue for brother and SIL, OP definitely could\u2019ve sent a heads up text to brother and let them decide if they wanted to be there for the announcement or not. \nAlso, I think it\u2019s important to highlight that based on the description of SILs reaction day of, she isn\u2019t trying to draw attention to her at all. Instead trying to take herself out of a situation that is probably very traumatic for her, and then once she is unable to pull herself out of a trauma response, taking herself out of the situation.

Giving a heads up would have been the right way to go. I have suffered baby loss and infertility and would have literally just walked out if something like that was sprung on me. Some people might think it selfish of me but, after everything I've been through, I need people to give me a bit more time to process pregnancy announcements.", "INFO So, did you have an hour to tell everyone before SIL arrived? If so, why didn\u2019t you tell them then?", "ESH. Yeah, SIL is overboard. That text is way too much. But she\u2019s also not entirely wrong. You could have let her know just before they were due to come over, or a week ago so she had time to process. My sister just had a miscarriage and we\u2019re TTC and I spend a crazy amount of time thinking about how we\u2019ll tell her.", "When will people learn not to co-opt existing events/holidays?", "YTA. It seems very clear that you, your wife, your brother and your SIL could have all reasonably determined that this news was likely to upset SIL. Her needs and feelings don\u2019t have to come before yours, but as she correctly pointed out in what I think was a very direct but fair text, you could have given her a heads up or announced before they arrived. At a minimum if she knew you planned on announcing your pregnancy at this gathering she could\u2019ve chosen to not be present. You deserve to celebrate and have it be a big deal that you are expecting and it seems like you made choices that turned your announcement into drama and less fun for everyone", "Im thinking maybe ESH. Your SIL definitely needs therapy and that text was over the top but she actually made some good points. A heads up would have been nice. Even though you\u2019re not obligated to do so, giving her and your brother time to process this could have made this better. I just read at least 6 articles and the number one thing they all say to do is to tell them privately and give them time to process before big announcements. Also it wasn\u2019t your intention but the shirts IMO were more gloating than verbally announcing it.", "NTA I think we might secretly have the same family because my sister acts the same way. I've cut contact with her for other reasons but she constantly belittled everything anyone else ever did. You're happy? No your not because I had a shitty day! You're upset? You don't know the meaning of upset because I had the worst week! \n\nPeople like that cannot be pleased and should not dictate your life. Celebrate your milestones and its her problem how she reacts. You weren't gloating or pointing and laughing at her issues.

While it\u2019s sad that SIL and your brother are having difficultly conceiving, it\u2019s not right for them to make you seem like bad people for announcing something they were bound to discover anyway. Congratulations on the pregnancy, and i hope all goes well.", "I thought her message was mature and heartfelt and doesn't reflect your description of her past behaviour.

Im all for announcing pregnancy whenever you want. That being said, you absolutely should have warned them/ gave them a head up. You said you had SIL in your thoughts but you really didn\u2019t. Your SIL was very respectful in how she handle it and didn\u2019t seem like the attention whxxx you tried to make her out to be. To me it\u2019s sounds like you did this personally to snub her", "NTA. My husband and I were infertile for 15 years before our son was born. Other people in our lives were allowed to get pregnant, announce it, and be excited. Was it sad for us? Sure. But that didn\u2019t mean the world stopped. The only thing I avoided were baby showers (ironically not because of the expectant couple/baby but because other people always wanted to ask about my family planning plans). You guys were not assholes for being excited.", "First:  You had every right to announce the pregnancy. \n\nBut you could have reasonably expected that your SIL would be upset. You decided that this was your time to be in the limelight and her reaction was that unhinged letter. \n\nShe had the last laugh too by upsetting you and playing drama queen and casting her long dark shadow of 6 losses on your happiness \n\nBest thing is to ignore her 100% NO reaction of any kind. Don't get drawn in by other family members either. You stick together.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy,  it is a wonderful and amazing experience!", "NTA. If you had given her a warning ahead of time, they probably wouldn't have gone to Christmas at all, so in their eyes you would have ruined their Christmas either way. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. It's awful that they've been through so much, but it doesn't mean you don't deserve to be happy, or that they shouldn't be happy for you. It seems like they're so wrapped up in their grief that they can't see the joy of a baby entering the family. Sometimes trauma brings out the worst in us, and people react to situations in ways they regret later.", "NTA honestly, you're not responsible for other people's feelings when it comes to your life.

Also what's up with SIL getting pets when she learns someone's pregnant i don't think that's a healthy way to cope", "NTA. But making and wearing t-shirts to wear at an x-mas party? That is borderline gloating and rubbing it into your SIL's face. Also depending when she had lost her 6th child and especially at what gestation time would hugely depend on how close you are on the line.

Were you supposed to just quietly show up with the new baby in nine months and just not tell anyone so you don't hurt her feelings?   That doesn't make sense to me.

They have a valid point in saying that the holidays are hard enough as it is when coping with pain like this and you went ahead and ruined this holiday for them. You did. You did do that. This situation could have been easily avoided or at the very least not as painful for them had you either: spoken to them privately beforehand about your intentions to do a pregnancy reveal during Christmas, or announced it on any day that wasn't Christmas itself. Christmas is about things like family and bonding with family, that doesn't mean \"everybody except the relatives that you don't like that much because they're coping poorly with trauma and loss.\"\n\nGet this, the way you describe the behavior of these two can very much serve as a description of your own behavior. \"she's a center of attention kind of person\" \"try to make herself look like the best person in the room\" It would not be hard to argue that these statements apply pretty easily to what you did over Christmas.\n\nI also note that you described their behavior as: \"If anyone else gets attention she tries to take it away from them, usually by putting them down verbally\" Whereas her actual reaction here was to silently leave and take some space for herself. That's arguably far more mature than immature in terms of what responses could come out of somebody who hasn't recovered at all from their trauma when they're slapped directly in the face with a massive trigger during a day that's supposed to be happy for them. Which I'm sure you also interpret as a ploy for attention. It seems like any response that isn't her pretending to be happy and not traumatized isn't going to be good enough for you and you will find any way you can to twist and warp her behavior into something far worse than it actually is.\n\n>We didn't want to upset her but we also didn't feel like it was right to let her dictate our actions and make it impossible to celebrate the life that we're creating.\n\nHave these people ever directly come up to you and said, \"If you ever get pregnant you're not allowed to tell anybody until we get pregnant?\" \"If you ever get pregnant you're not allowed to celebrate this around family?\" That sure doesn't seem to be the case otherwise those details would've likely been present in your story to emphasize why these two's behavior is just so downright atrocious. You claim you tried so so so hard to be considerate towards these people while they're these horrible unreasonable dictators with you when after all that thought the very reasonable idea of \"let's tell them beforehand so they can at least brace themselves for the announcement during Christmas\" didn't occur to you? A lot of what you've described about these people applies to you. Y'all definitely have a warped perspective about your own behavior and choices here.", "NTA", "YTA If you knew she had 6 miscarriages and didn\u2019t reach out and give her a heads up before announcing it to everyone. It would have given her time to process it in private so she could celebrate with you in public. You should apologize.", "NTA.", "YTA. The kind thing to do would have been to tell her first.

So they weren't just announcing it, they were rubbing it in people's faces. I think the SIL was justifiably upset and I think she handled it pretty well under the circumstances. She didn't disrupt the holiday, she didn't go on a massive rant. She sent a text that was pretty rational given how she must have been feeling. \nOP, I'd give you a break here if you'd just announced it quietly but the t-shirts? That's a YTA move.", "NTA.

Just ignore her. She'll either move on or continue to give you the silent treatment. Seems like a win either way.", "NTA, OP. You were damned if you do, and damned if you don't. I completely empathize with your SIL, but she was going to be hurt no matter when you announced it. If you gave her the heads up a day before, I doubt that she would have come for Christmas at all. She would have still said that you ruined Christmas for her, because she couldn't bear to be around you, knowing that your wife is expecting. She's upset that you sprang this on her, but she would have been upset no matter how you made the announcement. There are no good ways to announce something like this to someone who clearly carries as much trauma as your SIL does. Even the gentlest of announcements would still have upset her. You have every right to enjoy the announcement, and everyone saying that it was too showy can go eat a sock. You're allowed to be excited, joyous, and yes, showy. Your SIL's trauma is hers to deal with, especially when she would seemingly never be able to find it in herself to be happy for you. Don't let her take away your joy and excitement.", "NTA, why should you have to be secretive because she has health issues.

Hide away the whole pregnancy and when the baby arrives, hide the baby away because SIL can\u2019t have children?

Congratulations!", "NTA", "NTA. ignore SIL, do not give her any more attention than you give other people.", "NTA \n\nNo amount of head's-up or informing SIL beforehand would have mattered.

Does she expect every person that gets pregnant in the family to let her know first?  People have babies and why I get that can be hard for her, she needs to work on it not try to drag you two down during your happy moment. She didn\u2019t even say congratulations. I hope you don\u2019t let SIL take this joyful moment away from both of you.", "NTA - would a heads up text have helped? Maybe. But it\u2019s not required.

Expecting that nobody discuss pregnancy without getting her permission is not going to happen, and will leave her without female friends, which will not change if she does finally successfully conceive.

From a woman who has experienced that loss, your SIL is TA.", "Nta\n \nBut do agree  it would have been a kind thing to do to give her a heads up that you were going to announce so she could process it and not be blind sided or not come if it is that hard for her. \n\nWith that said your not required to do that. It's just a kind thing to do.", "NTA. I had 2 miscarriages before I had my daughter. The second one was twins, so a total of 3 babies.

That's how relationships work. Congratulations on your pregnancy!", "YTA. \n\nI agree with your SIL. You should have told them first privately and then announced it.", "yeah i don\u2019t understand how people can so quickly call SIL the only AH in this situation when OP supposedly tried to keep her in mind only to blindside her with the news of their pregnancy. doesn\u2019t mean there was any malicious intent like you said, but it was a pretty insensitive oversight that i hope OP can be more aware of going forward. \n\nlike there\u2019s a hell of a difference between letting SIL\u2019s struggles prevent you from celebrating the family you are creating and being mindful of how you approach triggering subjects. doesn\u2019t mean you have to bend over backwards to appease her and SIL rightfully so needs to deal with her own pain or disappointment with a licensed professional, but being kind and giving a heads up would\u2019ve cost nothing in this scenario.", "This is it. SIL had a point in her text: OP very well COULD have given her a heads up. That was a reasonable thing to be hurt about. Obviously she\u2019s lashing out and she needs to get help, so I don\u2019t condone her behavior, but it was fair for her to feel hurt by this because they knew it would be hurtful.", "I am really struggling with this as well. The first part of this post is \u201cwe talked about SIL/kept her in mind/discussed how to be sensitive to her loss\u201d then the solution(?) they came up with was to blindside her with tshirts at Christmas in a group reveal. \n\nLike really OP? \n\nHonestly this made me question the rest of the post and OP\u2019s assessment of SIL.", "I was so confused about t-shirt part. OP was all, we don\u2019t want to upset SIL, we just want to announce our pregnancy, but then he and his wife made t-shirts because they were\u2026 not gloating? How does this logic make sense? A simple announcement would just be saying the words \u201cwe\u2019re pregnant.\u201d", "Yeah the shirts are just SO far over the top...we get it, OP likes attention...it's inconsiderate at best and smug gloating at worst. I'd have to be there in person to tell you how bad it was exactly, but it wasn't good either way.", "I am surprised this is the only comment mentioning this. It wasn't a simple sharing of good news--OP had tee-shirts made for a big reveal. It was performative. You go through the trouble to do that and don't do it before SIL arrives or tell her in advance so she can process, that's a choice. An asshole choice.", "100% this. There are so many ways to tell family you're expecting a child that don't involve making merch.", "She is allowed to bask in her pregnancy. Her own pregnancy isn\u2019t about her SIL and she doesn\u2019t need to apologize for her pregnancy or for how she feels about it or for sharing that gleeful feeling with her family.", "Totally agreed. If OP and his wife had just given her a head\u2019s up- and an option to not be present for the announcement- that would have been the kinder approach.", "Disagree.  Absolutely would not give a heads up.  What an incredibly awkward conversation.  Way too hurtful.\n\nThe way OP approached the situation was far more graceful.", "OP legit thinks announcing a pregnancy with t-shirts is a sensitive way to break the news to someone who has suffered SIX miscarriages. You're calling SIL unhinged after her measured response? His judgement of her in the opening paragraph only serves to try and invalidate her feelings and skew our judgement. OP, YTA.", "This! That text was totally unhinged and people are way too busy taking up for the SIL to notice certain details. She placed all of the blame on the wife YET they were at OP's and her husband's mother's house. She then turned it around to make it about her with not going to any functions or that she didn't feel love in that house, which again isn't the wife's fault. She's not entitled to a heads-up and even if she got one, she still would have made it about her.", "Nope. I disagree with your assessment of being \"unhinged\". She grieved privately in the bathroom and excused herself early. She sent a thoughtful and fairly rational text. She does have six dead children. She's driving the point home as to how hurt she's feeling. I agree with her when she says a heads up would have been nice. As someone who has been involved in r/pregnant subs during both successful pregnancies, it doesn't take long before coming across advice on how to break the news of pregnancy to someone close who has only experienced loss. That advice? Send a text. \n\nI've used this advice myself affer reading of other's experience. It worked as well as I had hoped it would. My friend was able to process the news on her own time, respond emotionally without the pressure of feigning excitement, then text me when she was ready. \n\nOP: YTA. It's a holiday. It's meant to be shared amongst those you love. It's something to look forward to and enjoy. Being blindsided with news of someone's pregnancy after SIX miscarriages would be upsetting for anyone in that situation. I think it's fair to come to the conclusion that OP and family were not considerate.", "Yeah I gotta agree with you on one thing for sure \u2014 SIL needs major therapy. I\u2019m tentatively saying NTA for OP because, as someone with diagnosed PTSD from experiencing a lot of death/loss, the person who\u2019s responsible for my triggers is me. I can\u2019t expect the world to tiptoe around me, it\u2019s unreasonable. This goes for SIL too who, of course, has gone through something unimaginable six times over. But, getting coping skills to handle my triggers is why I\u2019m in therapy and it\u2019s helped me IMMENSELY. SIL definitely needs to go to therapy and get coping skills that don\u2019t include sending unhinged text messages like that.", "It's the t-shirts that put OP in AH territory", "Completely agree with this comment, YTA. You decided you don\u2019t like her personality as tou find it too much. So you used that to justify being inconsiderate. If you she had a character you did like, would you have given her a message to warn her in advance so she had time to process the news? I think you would have handled it differently, and that\u2019s why you gave the context of her being attention seeking. Which means you chose to surprise her rather than warn her. Which makes you an AH. Also the T-shirts are ridiculous. When is anyone ever going to wear them?", "Yes, this. OP is clearly the AH. If he and his wife had taken even two minutes to Google how to approach this sort of situation with sensitivity, they would have seen the common advice mentioned over and over of telling the SIL in private so she had time to process the news. Instead they not only sprang it on her, but they made t-shirts! OP clearly doesn\u2019t like SIL from the way he puts her down as a way to justify what they did. Which is probably why he didn\u2019t care about approaching this with tact.", "SIL also appears to have discussed how hard it is every time someone brings up anything remotely related to either pregnancy or good news of any flavour. SIL was going to be upset no matter when this announcement was made. I empathize with the SIL, that's a tremendous amount of grief to carry, but if the OP wants to announce that they're expecting when the family is gathered together already? That's there prerogative. SIL needs counseling, if she cannot separate their announcement from a personal slight. SIL's situation should not mean that the OP has to lose all of the joy in the fact that they're expecting, and that includes the grandiose announcement. SIL's position is tragic, but the world doesn't stop turning because of it.", "We actually didn't. One person, asides from my brother and SIL, wasn't present until after they got to the house. We wanted the entire family to be there, and I honestly thought being surrounded by loved ones would be the best way to soften the news for her, and we also believed giving an advanced warning wouldn't have changed the situation hence wanting everyone to be there.", "Thank you! The fact that people actually think the SIL is entitled to a heads-up is mind-boggling. She once again made it all about her and threatened not to come to any more family functions and yet people think that was a rational text message?", "My thoughts too", "It's genuinely wild that people are saying NTA here. I would be completely disgusted with OP's behavior if I was one of the people in the room-even if SIL is drama or whatever. It could have cost them five seconds to send a text. And honestly, the text message isn't that bad...she clearly needs therapy, but the point about how OP should have sent her a heads up text was bang on the money.", "I\u2019m so sorry for you and your wife\u2019s struggles but to say that OP is an AH for not giving them a heads up blows my mind. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if OP gave his SIL a heads up as she would have likely skipped Christmas to shift attention back to her. I cannot imagine the pain that OP\u2019s SIL endured but she needs to grow up and realize that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. \n\nNTA.", "What? SIL wrote in her text that she would have liked an head up. Did I miss something or have you interpreted this way wrong?", "She was always going to be blindsided with the news of the pregnancy and there was no circumstance in which she was going to feel handled sensitively or fairly. Her text makes that clear.", "Yeah, the tee-shirts are what firmly planted it into YTA territory for me", "Yes, t-shirts with your pregnancy announcement as a Christmas gift are soooooo graceful. \n\n/s", "Yeah, I don't get some of the comments on here. Even if they did text her, do people honestly believe she would be able to endure seeing the praises and well wishes? People are truly living in lala land.", "As someone who has had three miscarriages and whose friend announced her pregnancy on what would have been the third one\u2019s due date - no. That text was unhinged. And your Reddit pregnancy communities aren\u2019t doing you favours identifying what\u2019s reasonable. \n\nOP considered how to announce, but isn\u2019t required to tip toe around the biggest and happiest announcement of her own life just because someone else will be unhappy.", "I call BS here.  SIL would never be ok with any pregnancy announcement other than her own.  Check her track record in the post.  OP and spouse have no responsibility for SIL's feelings at all.  They don't impact the fact that she is pregnant and still going to have a baby.  Whether it's announced via text or in person does not change the fact at all.\n\nAnd where is Bro in all this?  Not one word from him.  SIL claims to be speaking for both.  That is also very telling.  Plus all the \"me\" and \"I\" statements. SIL would be responding this same way no matter when or how the news was dropped.\n\nI have had miscarriages myself and yes it can be debiliatingly upsetting to hear someone else announcing they are expecting while you are dealing with the aftermath of your own body's failure to sustain the life you want so desperately to carry for 9 months.  I get it.  But OP was damned no matter what she did.  If she gave SIL a heads up text, she wouldn't have come for Christmas and probably told the parents why.  Or she would have sat in the corner crying or bemoaning her sad fate.  Either way, it sucks the joy out of what should be a happy announcement.  \n\nOP is NTA for wanting to spread the happy news.  The AH is, unfortunately, the SIL who made the moment all about her, as OP feared.", "That text was not rational nor welcomed. People have the right to announce their happy news any way they see fit.

Who's to say she wouldn't have done something vindictive? \nThis weird culture of considering everyone's feelings before your own happiness is getting out of control. They didn't rub it in her face or gloat. \nDo you honestly think she'll be ok as the pregnancy progress? When they find out what they having? When they are picking out names? During the baby shower or when the baby actually gets here? Oh, and let's not forget first birthdays and the like. \nSIL needs therapy not sending texts about how she blindsided when it wasn't her business to begin with.", "6 miscarriages is NOT the same thing as 6 dead children.", "Lorrrrrd, you seem like the drama just as much as OP's sister.", "I gave my sister a trigger warning that there was a \u201cgranddog\u201d gift for my parents this year because she\u2019s bummed her circumstances don\u2019t currently allow her to have pets.
