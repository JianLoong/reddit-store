That sucks, I know, I'm not discounting that at all. That being said she's a center of attention kind of person, she will shit talk other people all day long and try to make herself look like the best person in the room. If anyone else gets attention she tries to take it away from them, usually by putting them down verbally, or by getting another dog or cat. Most of the animals she has were obtained right after other people she knew got pregnant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, wife and I got pregnant, discussed at length with how we should approach this, keeping my SIL in mind was the main topic of conversation. We didn't want to upset her but we also didn't feel like it was right to let her dictate our actions and make it impossible to celebrate the life that we're creating. So we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChristmas time, we come over to my mom's place, do present exchange, then change shirts. My mother was very happy but I could see the look on my SIL face, upset. She didn't say anything and just shut herself in the bathroom, then left early later on in the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext day she sends this message to my wife.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"To say I\u2019m disappointed, is an understatement.

Springing you\u2019re pregnant on (bro) and I like that was uncalled for and completely ruined not only mine, but (bro) Christmas. You could\u2019ve sent me a heads up text about this, so we had time to process this. And if your excuse is \u201coh I didnt want it to ruin the surprise for mom\u201d, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s a completely invalid fear. Because I would never ruin a surprise like that. Not only that, but you also saw how that affected me, and you wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. You\u2019re excited, sure. But read the room (wife). I cant tell you how much that damaged our relationship, and honestly. I dont know how many holidays I\u2019m going to be there for now because of what you did. What you did was completely selfish and careless. It showed me you really don\u2019t care about me. And honestly, had we gotten a heads up text, I\u2019d be happy for you. But right now? I\u2019m not. You both ruined Christmas for us. Idk why you thought that was such a good idea. You also had AN ENTIRE HOUR to do it before we got there. I had to leave early because I couldnt stand being there for another minute in a house that I didnt feel loved in.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only time we talked about it was when my family was asking questions, due date, gender, etc., it's not like we were talking about it throughout the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole (are we the assholes) for having decided to do the pregnancy announcement anyways?", "created_utc": 1672113900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw63qs/aita_for_announcing_our_pregnancy_at_xmas_knowing/", "score": 3134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How is having empathy for someone allowing them to dictate your actions?", "Eh, YTA. Your SIL has been through losses that you will never imagine. Even therapy isn't a magical fix. She has the right to feel her feelings and remove herself from a painful situation. \n\nWhat type of person she is has no bearing on this. If it does, you're an unnecessarily cruel person.\n\nYou could've done this in a phone call or in person at a different time, or at the very least given your SIL a heads up. You had other options, which wouldn't have reminded your SIL of 6 entire lifetimes of love that she will never experience.", "YTA\n\nIt's common courtesy to give people who you know will struggle with the announcement a private heads up. How did you talk about this announcement in length and not figure that out? Of course she is going to be hit by a tsunami of pain when she sees your announcement on a t-shirt, for crying out loud.\n\nHad she known, she could have decided not to come or asked you to announce before she arrived so she wouldn't have to be part of all the fuss and could just enjoy Christmas dinner. \n\nOr you could have just done your 'fun' announcement when you were alone with your parents on any other day and called your SIL afterwards. There are so many options that show that you care about her feelings. She is right to be mad, because you've demonstrated that you don't care.", "I\u2019m torn between Y-TA and E-SH. You could have done this a lot more sensitively. Instead you chose to do it in a dramatic, everyone scream and shout way. A big out of the blue and no way to escape giving a raw reaction way. You should have had a quiet word with them and either delayed your announcement to a special meal with just your parents or allowed your sibling and SIL to excuse themselves/hang back a bit. These situations are complicated and nuanced. SIL needs to be reasonable but it could not have hurt you guys or diminished your announcement in the least if you had shown just a little consideration. You forced them into an experience you knew would be painful for them.", "You\u2019re going to get particular responses here from people who probably mostly don\u2019t have kids and haven\u2019t had a miscarriage.\n\nBut if you posted in a pregnancy forum the advice you would have received pretty universally would have been to at least give SIL and brother a private heads up rather than blindsiding them on Christmas with your celebration T-shirts.\n\nI\u2019m sure you have no idea what it is like to have a miscarriage, to go through the physical and mental anguish that goes along with it. \n\nIn general I think announcing at Christmas is kind of tacky because it\u2019s a family holiday and it\u2019s not all about you and IMO it\u2019s kind of shitty to pull all focus to yourselves even if we don\u2019t touch the fact that your SIL has had 6 miscarriages. \n\nBut when you add that fact in along with the fact that you couldn\u2019t even give her a heads up so she could choose not to come or go in better prepared, for me this is a clear YTA.", "Oooh, I'm going to swim against the stream with ESH.\n\nSIL needs serious therapy, but she isn't wrong to feel her feelings.  And you WERE insensitive. \n\nI don't think you were malicious, so I can't go full YTA. But you discussed it beforehand, you both knew it would hurt her, and you did it anyway.\n\nIn a situation that delicate, a call or text to her,  or some other communication would have been more appropriate.  You're excited and deserve your moment in the sun. But it costs nothing to be kind", "YTA\n\nThere are hundreds of threads on reddit about how to announce pregnancy when someone in the family struggle with infertility. \n\nUsually it all comes down to one thing; give the ones who struggle a heads up. Nothing more, nothing less. It's very kind to do so. \n\nSo I guess I think YTA because of this, not because It was announced at Christmas or because SIL had miscarriages.", "You should have warned the family members who had six of their babies die. YTA.  SIL is acting over the top and full on but she is also in immense pain because you shocked her with a very sensitive topic instead of forewarning her. And for the record, I got a puppy after my miscarriage too and it wasn\u2019t for attention but just to hold a little life once more. You\u2019ve obviously never experienced this sort of loss.", "\u201cSo we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.\u201d\n\nYeah, you were gloating. You rubbed her face in your pregnancy.\n\nYTA for doing that. You could have easily announced the pregnancy with tact.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily the asshole\u2026You weren\u2019t malicious and you were thoughtful about how to approach it. [ETA: thoughtful = they thought about it and acknowledged it would be hard on SIL\u2026just executed poorly]\n\nBut I do agree with your SIL. I think this is a common mistake people make. They are so worried about other peoples grief they make assumptions. I do agree with the SIL that they should have gotten a heads up. As someone who has had miscarriages- it doesn\u2019t feel great when people are walking on eggshells for you. But I also get that (maybe) you haven\u2019t experienced this kind of loss - so you\u2019d have no idea. \n\nI think you just apologize and hopefully she (SIL) can move on. But you should def apologize for not just talking to her about it.", "Yta. You could have been sensitive but you chose not to be", "NTA and WOW sil needs severe therapy. Like SEVERE. All of her behavior screams \u201cunhinged\u201d. I feel bad for her but that\u2019s a lot of trauma dumping to aggressively hostile text someone about \u201c6 dead children\u201d. That\u2019s disturbing to hear that. Also she definitely wouldn\u2019t have been happy for you if you texted her before Christmas. It just would\u2019ve been a different reason she was upset! Because it\u2019s not about the timing or the heads up\u2026 it\u2019s just that you guys are pregnant and she\u2019s not. I hope you can encourage your brother to get her help. Congrats on your baby\n\nETA: thanks for the awards guys! And to the people wishing me ill and hoping for a miscarriage for me in my replies and messages, congratulations!! Your dreams have come true!! I have before. Which is why I know it\u2019s not okay to trauma dump.", "YTA.\n\nYour SIL needs help, clearly. Her own infertility issues do not mean you have to tamp down your own joy. \n\nBut you were extremely insensitive, bordering on cruel, popping that on her with no warning in a group setting. You should have told her privately beforehand so it didn't hit her like a Mack truck with other people watching.", "It wasn\u2019t wrong to announce it. But YTA because SIL is right, you were insensitive because you could have given a heads up. It seems like you know this because  you attempt to justify your actions by bad talking you sil in the beginning of your post.", "Yta.  Should have let her know privately first before announcing to everyone. \nA text the week before would have given her enough notice to get her mask in place.", "YTA.\n\nYour SIL (and presumably your brother; why isn\u2019t he factored into this) is always going to be upset over pregnancy announcements, even if she\u2019s happy for the parents to be.\n\nAll you owed her and your brother was a little heads up and an opportunity for them to process your news privately first. That way they could at least grieve their losses and then put on a happier face in front of the whole family.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do that, so I might have made an E S H judgment, EXCEPT THAT YOU MADE BABY ANNOUNCEMENT T-SHIRTS AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS. That is such an A-Hole move under the circumstances. Like, wow.", "ESH. \n\nWhen publicly announcing a pregnancy in the presence of someone suffering from infertility, the kind and compassionate thing to do is give them a heads up and let them know what\u2019s coming so they could decide if they want to present for the announcement. A call or text a day or two ahead would suffice. Or pick a time when they\u2019re not present and then tell them privately after the fact if you\u2019re worried about them ruining the surprise. You say you and your wife discussed how to go about it in regards to your SIL, but it seems you just decided to disregard her feelings completely. I understand you\u2019re fed up with her attention seeking behavior but 6 miscarriages is a lot of grief and heartbreak and your brother suffered those loses as well. Couldn\u2019t you have at least taken his pain into consideration? \n\nIf SIL truly acts how you describe then she sucks for that. If the text was just an airing of grievances and explaining why she and your brother were hurt, I\u2019d say no big deal but she\u2019s taking a pretty hostile tone towards your wife and it comes off as more of an attack. I understand she\u2019s hurt but she could have said she was happy for you but the announcement brought up a lot of difficult feelings for her and she would have appreciated a heads up.", "YTA. It would have cost $0 and 2 minutes of your time to send SIL a heads up text.", "YTA. Compassion and kindness are free. If you were in her shoes how would you have wanted to be treated. You have every right to announce your baby any way you want. No one can dictate how you announce your pregnancy but a world full of \u2018 I\u2019ll get mine first\u2019, isn\u2019t the one you should want your child to enter into. Your SILs response was not even cruel or mean, just a heartfelt expression of the pain caused. You are here because you know you handled this badly.", "YTA. Anyone who knows anyone who is dealing with infertility (and multiple dead children) knows that the best way to share this type of news is in a way that allows the person to process in private. They can be happy for you but also absolutely fucking devastated for themselves.\n\nThe sensitive thing would have been to call or message them the day before with the news so they could process in private and decide if they could be a positive addition to the celebration. \n\nYou just decided to sideswipe them in the middle of a family celebration. Not cool. Congratulations on your pregnancy OP, but please be more sensitive to people who may have to work through complicated personal emotions in order to celebrate your baby.", "YTA. If your family didn't have someone in it who has buried 6 kids trying to have a baby then this kind of public announcement might be ok. But given the context, it's inconsiderate at best. I don't get the need to make an \"event\" of it. Tell the people who need to know privately and take off the pressure of the \"big public scene\" aspect.", "This is a rough one all around. BUT, knowing that this is a very sensitive issue for brother and SIL, OP definitely could\u2019ve sent a heads up text to brother and let them decide if they wanted to be there for the announcement or not. \nAlso, I think it\u2019s important to highlight that based on the description of SILs reaction day of, she isn\u2019t trying to draw attention to her at all. Instead trying to take herself out of a situation that is probably very traumatic for her, and then once she is unable to pull herself out of a trauma response, taking herself out of the situation.

Giving a heads up would have been the right way to go. I have suffered baby loss and infertility and would have literally just walked out if something like that was sprung on me. Some people might think it selfish of me but, after everything I've been through, I need people to give me a bit more time to process pregnancy announcements.", "INFO So, did you have an hour to tell everyone before SIL arrived? If so, why didn\u2019t you tell them then?", "ESH. Yeah, SIL is overboard. That text is way too much. But she\u2019s also not entirely wrong. You could have let her know just before they were due to come over, or a week ago so she had time to process. My sister just had a miscarriage and we\u2019re TTC and I spend a crazy amount of time thinking about how we\u2019ll tell her.", "When will people learn not to co-opt existing events/holidays?", "YTA. It seems very clear that you, your wife, your brother and your SIL could have all reasonably determined that this news was likely to upset SIL. Her needs and feelings don\u2019t have to come before yours, but as she correctly pointed out in what I think was a very direct but fair text, you could have given her a heads up or announced before they arrived. At a minimum if she knew you planned on announcing your pregnancy at this gathering she could\u2019ve chosen to not be present. You deserve to celebrate and have it be a big deal that you are expecting and it seems like you made choices that turned your announcement into drama and less fun for everyone", "Im thinking maybe ESH. Your SIL definitely needs therapy and that text was over the top but she actually made some good points. A heads up would have been nice. Even though you\u2019re not obligated to do so, giving her and your brother time to process this could have made this better. I just read at least 6 articles and the number one thing they all say to do is to tell them privately and give them time to process before big announcements. Also it wasn\u2019t your intention but the shirts IMO were more gloating than verbally announcing it.", "NTA I think we might secretly have the same family because my sister acts the same way. I've cut contact with her for other reasons but she constantly belittled everything anyone else ever did. You're happy? No your not because I had a shitty day! You're upset? You don't know the meaning of upset because I had the worst week! \n\nPeople like that cannot be pleased and should not dictate your life.

While it\u2019s sad that SIL and your brother are having difficultly conceiving, it\u2019s not right for them to make you seem like bad people for announcing something they were bound to discover anyway.

Other people in our lives were allowed to get pregnant, announce it, and be excited. Was it sad for us? Sure. But that didn\u2019t mean the world stopped.

You guys were not assholes for being excited.", "First:  You had every right to announce the pregnancy. \n\nBut you could have reasonably expected that your SIL would be upset. You decided that this was your time to be in the limelight and her reaction was that unhinged letter. \n\nShe had the last laugh too by upsetting you and playing drama queen and casting her long dark shadow of 6 losses on your happiness \n\nBest thing is to ignore her 100% NO reaction of any kind.

You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. It's awful that they've been through so much, but it doesn't mean you don't deserve to be happy, or that they shouldn't be happy for you. It seems like they're so wrapped up in their grief that they can't see the joy of a baby entering the family. Sometimes trauma brings out the worst in us, and people react to situations in ways they regret later.", "NTA honestly, you're not responsible for other people's feelings when it comes to your life.

But anyone struggling with fertility issues is due at least the courtesy of a text before you spring a pregnancy announcement on them. \n\nAnd by the way, did you ever stop to consider how much this also hurts your brother?", "~~E/S/H~~  YTA\n\nObviously SIL and your brother can't reasonably expect everyone around them to never get pregnant until they do or to keep those pregnancies an utmost secret solely on their behalf. The world doesn't cater to them and it's time they realized that, no matter how difficult and traumatizing what they've went through is. It is on them to build their resilience and to find a way to vocalize and assert their boundaries (within reason) to those around them so that they can participate in family functions without this being such an impactful recurring issue for them.\n\nHowever, you are most certainly an AH here too. They have a valid point in saying that the holidays are hard enough as it is when coping with pain like this and you went ahead and ruined this holiday for them. You did. You did do that. This situation could have been easily avoided or at the very least not as painful for them had you either: spoken to them privately beforehand about your intentions to do a pregnancy reveal during Christmas, or announced it on any day that wasn't Christmas itself. Christmas is about things like family and bonding with family, that doesn't mean \"everybody except the relatives that you don't like that much because they're coping poorly with trauma and loss.\"\n\nGet this, the way you describe the behavior of these two can very much serve as a description of your own behavior. \"she's a center of attention kind of person\" \"try to make herself look like the best person in the room\" It would not be hard to argue that these statements apply pretty easily to what you did over Christmas.\n\nI also note that you described their behavior as: \"If anyone else gets attention she tries to take it away from them, usually by putting them down verbally\" Whereas her actual reaction here was to silently leave and take some space for herself. That's arguably far more mature than immature in terms of what responses could come out of somebody who hasn't recovered at all from their trauma when they're slapped directly in the face with a massive trigger during a day that's supposed to be happy for them. Which I'm sure you also interpret as a ploy for attention. It seems like any response that isn't her pretending to be happy and not traumatized isn't going to be good enough for you and you will find any way you can to twist and warp her behavior into something far worse than it actually is.\n\n>We didn't want to upset her but we also didn't feel like it was right to let her dictate our actions and make it impossible to celebrate the life that we're creating.\n\nHave these people ever directly come up to you and said, \"If you ever get pregnant you're not allowed to tell anybody until we get pregnant?\" \"If you ever get pregnant you're not allowed to celebrate this around family?\" That sure doesn't seem to be the case otherwise those details would've likely been present in your story to emphasize why these two's behavior is just so downright atrocious. You claim you tried so so so hard to be considerate towards these people while they're these horrible unreasonable dictators with you when after all that thought the very reasonable idea of \"let's tell them beforehand so they can at least brace themselves for the announcement during Christmas\" didn't occur to you? A lot of what you've described about these people applies to you. Y'all definitely have a warped perspective about your own behavior and choices here.", "NTA", "YTA If you knew she had 6 miscarriages and didn\u2019t reach out and give her a heads up before announcing it to everyone.

So they weren't just announcing it, they were rubbing it in people's faces. I think the SIL was justifiably upset and I think she handled it pretty well under the circumstances. She didn't disrupt the holiday, she didn't go on a massive rant.

She's upset that you sprang this on her, but she would have been upset no matter how you made the announcement. There are no good ways to announce something like this to someone who clearly carries as much trauma as your SIL does. Even the gentlest of announcements would still have upset her. You have every right to enjoy the announcement, and everyone saying that it was too showy can go eat a sock. You're allowed to be excited, joyous, and yes, showy.

OP was all, we don\u2019t want to upset SIL, we just want to announce our pregnancy, but then he and his wife made t-shirts because they were\u2026 not gloating? How does this logic make sense? A simple announcement would just be saying the words \u201cwe\u2019re pregnant.\u201d", "Yeah the shirts are just SO far over the top...we get it, OP likes attention...it's inconsiderate at best and smug gloating at worst. I'd have to be there in person to tell you how bad it was exactly, but it wasn't good either way.", "I am surprised this is the only comment mentioning this. It wasn't a simple sharing of good news--OP had tee-shirts made for a big reveal. It was performative. You go through the trouble to do that and don't do it before SIL arrives or tell her in advance so she can process, that's a choice. An asshole choice.", "100% this. There are so many ways to tell family you're expecting a child that don't involve making merch.", "She is allowed to bask in her pregnancy.

If OP and his wife had just given her a head\u2019s up- and an option to not be present for the announcement- that would have been the kinder approach.", "Disagree.  Absolutely would not give a heads up.  What an incredibly awkward conversation.  Way too hurtful.\n\nThe way OP approached the situation was far more graceful.", "OP legit thinks announcing a pregnancy with t-shirts is a sensitive way to break the news to someone who has suffered SIX miscarriages. You're calling SIL unhinged after her measured response? His judgement of her in the opening paragraph only serves to try and invalidate her feelings and skew our judgement. OP, YTA.", "This! That text was totally unhinged and people are way too busy taking up for the SIL to notice certain details. She placed all of the blame on the wife YET they were at OP's and her husband's mother's house. She then turned it around to make it about her with not going to any functions or that she didn't feel love in that house, which again isn't the wife's fault. She's not entitled to a heads-up and even if she got one, she still would have made it about her.", "Nope. I disagree with your assessment of being \"unhinged\". She grieved privately in the bathroom and excused herself early. She sent a thoughtful and fairly rational text. She does have six dead children. She's driving the point home as to how hurt she's feeling. I agree with her when she says a heads up would have been nice. As someone who has been involved in r/pregnant subs during both successful pregnancies, it doesn't take long before coming across advice on how to break the news of pregnancy to someone close who has only experienced loss. That advice? Send a text. \n\nI've used this advice myself affer reading of other's experience. It worked as well as I had hoped it would. My friend was able to process the news on her own time, respond emotionally without the pressure of feigning excitement, then text me when she was ready. \n\nOP: YTA. It's a holiday. It's meant to be shared amongst those you love. It's something to look forward to and enjoy. Being blindsided with news of someone's pregnancy after SIX miscarriages would be upsetting for anyone in that situation. I think it's fair to come to the conclusion that OP and family were not considerate.\n\nETA - We aren't going to change each other's minds here. I'm no longer responding but I stand by my evaluation. Yes, she needs therapy, but I see a plea for empathy. I see someone who thought in all their time and talks with one another, these are people she thought could understand. She isn't mad at them for getting pregnant. She isn't placing blame for why she can't get pregnant. I see her as someone expressing her level of pain from people she thought would be able to show greater compassion. It didn't happen that way. She's hurt. Hopefully there is room for growth and the family will see better days ahead.", "Yeah I gotta agree with you on one thing for sure \u2014 SIL needs major therapy. I\u2019m tentatively saying N T A for OP because, as someone with diagnosed PTSD from experiencing a lot of death/loss, the person who\u2019s responsible for my triggers is me. I can\u2019t expect the world to tiptoe around me, it\u2019s unreasonable. This goes for SIL too who, of course, has gone through something unimaginable six times over. But, getting coping skills to handle my triggers is why I\u2019m in therapy and it\u2019s helped me IMMENSELY. SIL definitely needs to go to therapy and get coping skills that don\u2019t include sending unhinged text messages like that.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sort of leaning away from N T A but I\u2019m not sure in which direction. Having shirts was kind of a dick move, but again, SIL needs therapy and I don\u2019t think OP and his wife were intentionally trying to goad SIL or shove it in her face.", "It's the t-shirts that put OP in AH territory", "Completely agree with this comment, YTA. You decided you don\u2019t like her personality as tou find it too much. So you used that to justify being inconsiderate. If you she had a character you did like, would you have given her a message to warn her in advance so she had time to process the news? I think you would have handled it differently, and that\u2019s why you gave the context of her being attention seeking. Which means you chose to surprise her rather than warn her. Which makes you an AH. Also the T-shirts are ridiculous. When is anyone ever going to wear them?", "Yes, this. OP is clearly the AH. If he and his wife had taken even two minutes to Google how to approach this sort of situation with sensitivity, they would have seen the common advice mentioned over and over of telling the SIL in private so she had time to process the news. Instead they not only sprang it on her, but they made t-shirts! OP clearly doesn\u2019t like SIL from the way he puts her down as a way to justify what they did. Which is probably why he didn\u2019t care about approaching this with tact.", "SIL also appears to have discussed how hard it is every time someone brings up anything remotely related to either pregnancy or good news of any flavour. SIL was going to be upset no matter when this announcement was made. I empathize with the SIL, that's a tremendous amount of grief to carry, but if the OP wants to announce that they're expecting when the family is gathered together already? That's there prerogative. SIL needs counseling, if she cannot separate their announcement from a personal slight. SIL's situation should not mean that the OP has to lose all of the joy in the fact that they're expecting, and that includes the grandiose announcement. SIL's position is tragic, but the world doesn't stop turning because of it.", "We actually didn't. One person, asides from my brother and SIL, wasn't present until after they got to the house. We wanted the entire family to be there, and I honestly thought being surrounded by loved ones would be the best way to soften the news for her, and we also believed giving an advanced warning wouldn't have changed the situation hence wanting everyone to be there.", "Thank you! The fact that people actually think the SIL is entitled to a heads-up is mind-boggling. She once again made it all about her and threatened not to come to any more family functions and yet people think that was a rational text message?", "My thoughts too", "It's genuinely wild that people are saying NTA here. I would be completely disgusted with OP's behavior if I was one of the people in the room-even if SIL is drama or whatever. It could have cost them five seconds to send a text.

It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if OP gave his SIL a heads up as she would have likely skipped Christmas to shift attention back to her.

SIL wrote in her text that she would have liked an head up.

I get it.  But OP was damned no matter what she did.  If she gave SIL a heads up text, she wouldn't have come for Christmas and probably told the parents why.  Or she would have sat in the corner crying or bemoaning her sad fate.  Either way, it sucks the joy out of what should be a happy announcement.  \n\nOP is NTA for wanting to spread the happy news.

I dread Christmas every year because of family like you. You are incredibly inconsiderate and weirdly sound jealous of your SILs attention for her miscarriages. I promise she would trade in all the attention for a successful pregnancy. \n\nAll you had to do was give her a heads up. That\u2019s it. People with infertility learn to adapt through the pain but it really sucks when people who you are close to, who you\u2019ve shared your pain with do not understand what you are suffering. We don\u2019t expect everyone to stop and adapt their lives for us. We are happy for you, we want you to have a successful pregnancy but we also would like time to process that news in private. To decide whether it is in the best interest of everyone for us to attend something if we think it\u2019ll be too emotional. We don\u2019t want to pull the attention because of emotion. \n\nHow about doing a quick google search to understand how people with infertility feel. There is a reason why it seems like so many people with infertility are irrational or need therapy. We feel like we are screaming into a void that nobody hears or cares to understand. Every where we look there are reminders of what we can\u2019t have. It\u2019s not just having a child it\u2019s every stage of the process. Its completely rewriting our story and what our live will look like. \n\nAdditionally every miscarriage sends your hormones on a roller coaster. \n\nAlso her pets aren\u2019t to steal attention. It\u2019s a way to cope with her pain. I have too many pets and it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve survived the last 3 years. Just because you can\u2019t have a child doesn\u2019t mean the yearning to care and nurture goes away. Sometimes that\u2019s the best you can do. \n\nBefore anyone suggests fertility treatments or adoption just don\u2019t. We\u2019ve all looked into it, we\u2019ve all weighed what is the best decision for ourselves. Both are expensive & take a very long time. Both have extensive exclusion criteria. Neither guarantee a child. They are not an option for everyone.", "YTA\n\nIt would have cost you nothing to send your SIL a text beforehand. You described her as some kind of unhinged crazy cat lady that replaces her sadness with pets and will always take the spotlight - instead, she didn't say anything and left early. Doesn't sound like a drama queen to me?\n\nHer letter also paints a different story. While I do think that she needs therapy, she sounds very composed telling you what other options there were. She's right on every point.\n\nIt's common courtesy to inform people who will obviously be hurt by such an announcement. Instead, you went all out with matching t-shirts. You argue that you didn't talk about it all day, but I'm assuming you wore the t-shirts?", "YTA for not giving her a heads up", "YTA. You made shirts announcing a pregnancy? Yeah, you were gloating. Especially at the holidays. As someone who has suffered multiple miscarriages before my rainbow baby, holidays were the hardest. You're reminded of everything you don't have when you wake up to silence, instead of a baby crying for you or young children excitedly wanting their presents. When you walk into a store and you see the presents advertised for children, and know you have nobody to buy them for. When you see the Christmas adverts with the happy families, and feel like yours is empty. The hardest is when you walk past the baby clothes that say things like: \"My first Christmas!\", and your heart breaks a bit further and it's all you can do not to sob. Because your baby didn't get a first Christmas, they won't get any Christmas, because they died inside of you. Their tiny heart stopped beating right inside of you, and nothing, and I mean *nothing* hurts more than that. You feel as though you failed them, failed yourself, failed your partner, you just feel like a failure and holidays without the baby you've dreamed of so hard and almost unbearable. Then when you're already doing so well to cope through all of that, you have someone waltz in wearing shirts saying they're pregnant, and it's a complete shock and surprise to you? That's like a punch in the face. You could've waited until after the holidays, you could've sent a text first. What you did was down right insensitive to your SIL and *YOUR OWN BROTHER* because he will be feeling that pain too. Wearing those shirts instead of just doing a verbal announcement (and letting them know first) as just a giant \"Look what I have!\". Grow up.", "I'm going to go a little against the grain here and say YTA. Yes, the SIL does probably need therapy to help the grieving process (not because of her reaction, which was very rational imo as well as her text, but because this is a huge loss and therapy will help) but you went about this in a very insensitive way. She has made it known to you how they BOTH feel especially around the holidays. You didn't HAVE to do it on Christmas but I'm not even saying you're the asshole for that. You're the asshole because she's absolutely right in that you should have sent her a courtesy text. It doesn't take very long to send a simple message letting her know in advance. Like she said, she wouldn't have ruined a surprised like that for you. You're both insensitive assholes for not letting them know ahead of time after they let their very valid feelings be known.\nI also completely disagree with the comments saying SIL text was unhinged or uncalled for. She put her feelings into words very rationally and she made it all very clear. She pointed out the 6 dead babies because that's exactly what they are.", "YTA. And you expressed it through a fucking t-shirt. What\u2019s next? A surprise gender reveal right on her front lawn with pink colored confetti raining only on her house?", "She did not seem at all like someone who wanted the spotlight on herself. She went to the bathroom so noone would see her cry, she left early in order not to ruin it for anyone else.\n\nHer text is well phrased, she explained why she would not enjoy your or your wife's company for the foreseeable future, and why she does not feel as if her feelings are considered.\n\n6 miscarriages. Jeesh. Like, I had one, and I am still out of order on Christmas and New Year. On Christmas, and New Year  I was pregnant. And 1 week later, I suddenly wasn't.  And every fucking Christmas I'm  thinking about that.\nI get that you might think 'Its not a real baby, why is she making a big deal out of it?'. And you're right, it's not a baby yet. But it is the possibility of a child, a person, that is in your mind already as soon as you know it is in your belly. And then suddenly that possibility is gone. And she had that 6 times!\n(I noticed you didn't mention when the last one was.)\n\nAnd you claiming you didn't talk about it all evening is bullshit. You had freaking t-shirts made. Which you wore. Which she would have seen all evening.\n\nYTA.\nIt seems like you already don't like her much (as per your first paragraph). And it seems like you wanted everyone to fall over themselves for your luck and since she cannot give you that because she is hurting, you think she is the bad guy here.", "YTA - Beyond me how you went from \u201cwe were trying to be very conscientious and tactful because we knew this would be deeply triggering to SIL.\u201d To \u201cso anyways we made tshirts\u201d \n\nJust send a text. The fact that you didn\u2019t, coupled with the exaggerated description of her at the beginning and the spectacle of it make it sound like you both enjoyed the pain you caused her and don\u2019t want to admit it.", "YTA imo.\n\nHaving struggled with getting pregnant and having miscarriages, I might be a little more sympathetic to SILs feelings than you are, but you have spoken to her about this. You knew her feelings on the matter. It wasn't hard to speak to her beforehand, give her a heads up. We have done so with a few friends who we knew struggled with infertility. It does not ruin a surprise, it gives people the chance to put on a brave face.\n\nTo me you weren't malicious, although I feel mentioning that SIL needs to be centre of attention by getting a pet crosses into 'mean' for me. You realise it is a coping mechanism for her? I realise it isn't healthy, and SIL might want to look into therapy, but her text doesn't make her the AH, nor does her leaving early.", "YTA. You knew this was going to be hard for her and infertility is devastating for those suffering. You could have been more sensitive.", "YTA. That\u2019s the nicest thing I can say.", "YTA, why did you feel it was necessary to announce this at Christmas, and also making shirts for the occasion seems very over the top", "YTA\n\nSIL \u201cshe\u2019s a centre of attention kind of person\u201d she didn\u2019t try to be the centre of attention - she excused herself and left early being unable to cope with the news\n\n\u201cKeeping my SIL in mind\u201d at what point in how you announced it did you keep her in mind not wanting to upset her?\n\n\u201cSo we made t-shirts announcing it\u201d t-shirts?? You didn\u2019t just tell your family your wonderful news, you got it printed for all to continually see, you were 100% gloating with the way you did it.\n\nYour SIL was grieving her 6 losses. Christmas is when she would have been imagining her children opening their presents and having a family. \n\nShe told you she would have appreciated you telling her before hand. That\u2019s all. A 2 minute conversation where you were better people and actually thought about someone other than yourself. \n\nYou are not AHs for announcing your pregnancy. As someone who has lost babies, we understand life goes on and other people will have the news you are desperate to have but it doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t hurt like hell. You are absolutely the AHs for not being kind and telling your SIL before hand and for doing the whole rubbing it in your face t-shirt thing.", "INFO. how much have you tried to put yourself in your brother and SIL's position? You're super excited right now - so were they about their pregnancies. Imagine you lose your baby now. How that feels. Your disappointment. Watching your wife in pain. Now imagine it happening 6 times  And then your brother turns up in a t-shirt announcing his wife's pregnancy, blindsiding you when you were trying to be happy.\n\n\nDid this factor into any of your thinking? Did you consider how you'd want to hear it in his situation?", ">So we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.\n\nYou made tshirts!! Of course you were gloating and rubbing it in. Maybe that wasn't your original intention but a t-shirt definitely screams \"Look at me\" \n\n\n\n>You could\u2019ve sent me a heads up text about this, so we had time to process this. And if your excuse is \u201coh I didnt want it to ruin the surprise for mom\u201d, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s a completely invalid fear. Because I would never ruin a surprise like that.\n\nShe's absolutely right. There's no reason why you couldn't have given her the heads up. She didn't even make a scene just left.", "YTA, not for announcing the pregnancy, but the way you did so. The T-Shirts thing was a dick move.\n\nYou imply that your SIL is an attention seeker, so are you. \n\nYour SIL is right. You could have given them an heads up beforehand.\n\nYou could have even said, \"mom, we wanted to tell you something before Bro and SIL get here,\"  but no. You went for the look at us T-shirts and made SIL really uncomfortable.", "ESH. The SIL is probably really depressed about her six dead children and that's why she tries to bring other people down but you guys could have warned her ahead of time because you knew she would be upset", "NTA. But also, it could have been different. I have a sister who had several miscarriages. She was subject to watching all of our siblings grow their families and she couldn\u2019t carry a child. \n\nWhen I got pregnant, I told her first, in a kind and caring way. I let her react, respond, and grieve once again. After she was okay with it, which I knew she would be, I announced it to the rest of the family. \n\nThat sister is still all about herself. It\u2019s kind of a thing when you don\u2019t have your own kids to be all about. \n\nA little sensitivity can go a long way.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter how they found out, they have had 6 miscarriages, and were never going to be happy for you, because they are not in the right frame of mind to be so. I agree with them that maybe you could have told them previously, or maybe even told your parents after Christmas. But I really don\u2019t think that wouldn\u2019t have also been a \u201cbetrayal\u201d in their minds as well. The tshirts may have been a bad idea.", "NTA, SIL needs to understand that not everything baby related needs to get vetted by her first.  While having miscarriages and not being able to conceive is horrible, you checking in with her before hand would set a bad precedent.  You having a baby doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her not being able to have one.  It seems like you aren\u2019t taunting her or rubbing it in her face.  I\u2019m just not sure why she thinks her feelings are more important than you sharing your happiness", "Nta", "NTA. You did something nice to announce your pregnancy. Lots of people do it on Christmas. Your SIL needs some major therapy though. MISCARRIAGES ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE DEATH OF CHILDREN. And after 6 of them is she finally pursuing another avenue to motherhood? Honestly for her to say that shit hurts and invalidates everyone who has lost ACTUAL children.", "NTA.\n\nSIL:  \u201cHonestly, had we gotten a heads up text, I\u2019d be happy for you\u201d\nNarrator:  \u201cThis was a lie.  SIL will never be happy for OP and wife and will, forever-more, make their pregnancy and their child about her.\u201d\n\nYou are allowed to be excited and enjoy your pregnancy and birth experience and you are allowed to include your family in your excitement and joy.  You are not responsible for your SIL\u2019s issues.", "YTA. \n\nAs someone who has been through similar experiences on both sides. All you needed to do was prep your SIL before you announced it to everyone. \n\nInsensitive AHs.", "NTA. You can't put your life and family aside because of SIL's infertility issues. She needs to get therapy to deal with her trauma.", "Yta, as a person who has two children but also had some fertility issues I can't tell you how cold this is. You knew this was going to be tough for sil so you had t shirts made and you did it in front of them. It sounds like you actually wanted to hurt her. \n\nSeriously don't understand the elaborate pregnancy announcements, what happened to just telling people? First thing you need to learn as a parent is no one cares as much as you do, you don't need a gender reveal, giant baby shower, elaborate pregnancy reveal. If you need to have something specifically made up then that's a big indicator your taking it too far. You could have easily done this when they weren't around. Its clear you don't like sil and it seems like you did it on purpose", "NAH, OP. I see a lot of people saying the opposite, and I can see what they\u2019re saying.\n\nBut that news wasn\u2019t going to be good no matter how she got it. I understand her being hurt and going off to another room if she was overcome. But she was always going to have a hard time with almost every moment of someone else\u2019s pregnancy. She\u2019s been through extreme trauma.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to keep your happy news in the dark. Is she within her rights to be hurt? ABSOLUTELY. But does her hurt mean she is incapable of being happy for you? No. Her hurt feelings aren\u2019t on your shoulders. Your news is not about her.\n\nAgain- she is perfectly within her rights to feel her feelings. But she does not have the right to make it your problem.\n\nShe needs help, and I mean that with no judgement. She has been through a lot and these sorts of feelings are ones she should be talking with a therapist about. She needs to be working through these feelings in a healthy way, not venting them at someone who has what she wants. Maybe talk to your brother about them attending therapy together. Or suggest he float the idea to her of therapy, because anyone who has been through what she\u2019s been through would need help to process and grieve in a way that isn\u2019t self-destructive.\n\nWas she right to trauma dump on you? No. But that doesn\u2019t make her an AH. Just a woman who is struggling in grief.", "Sorry but she has a point \n\nAlso, when was her last miscarriage ?", "YTA for the t-shirts, that's taking things way too far. Had your SIL not been there I'd have said they're just tacky but whatever, wearing a baby announcement on your shirt for the day is OTT in normal circumstances but downright cruel in this particular one. If you'd have just told people with you know, words, like adults usually use to communicate, then that would not have been an AH move at all and maybe you could have enjoyed the holiday with your SIL. This way you made sure she'd have the visuals to deal with just to really rub it in her face.", "NTA, I think you should be able to express your joy.  \nMaybe you could've indeed send her a heads up, but somewhere I think it would not have mattered at all. She wouldve been mad anyway", "NTA. I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re not allowed to share your excitement with your people if you want to. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have shared it with your SIL at all, but it\u2019s a normal thing to discuss when you\u2019re around family.  But why you need to break the news to your sister in law before your own mom is beyond me. I feel like this is the sort of stuff people share at family gatherings. \n\nIs your SIL on the younger side or is she deep in \u00ab\u00a0geriatric pregnancy\u00a0\u00bb territory? If she\u2019s like in her 20s I can see why she\u2019s really freaked out about her situation but if these miscarriages all happened after like age 40, it kind of casts a different light on the situation. \n\nAnyway, people are giving you way too much shit about this. The t shirt idea was goofy though, ngl. Are you from the Midwest?", "NTA. There\u2019s not a way OP could\u2019ve announced it that wouldn\u2019t have hurt her SIL.", "NTA\n\nWhy do they need to prepare themself for it idk they're gonna feel some type of way about news on pregnancies anyway. And that's fine, if you did give a headsup it would've been nice I guess. But their reaction is still over the top.", "NTA. She needs to get over herself. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate how other people celebrate. Yes having miscarriages is sad but she\u2019s being a bit dramatic and selfish. I would honestly ignore her.", "NAH. The way you describe the SIL there was probably no way you were going to win .  If you sent her a text\u2026How could you send something like that so coldly and impersonally.  Didn\u2019t she deserve to hear it in person?  If you only told grandma\u2026What?  It a secret?  My point is that I don\u2019t think you would have found a way that she would have liked.  I\u2019m so sorry she had so many miscarriages but they were not your fault.  But now you can\u2019t be excited about your baby?", "NTA", "NTA, you have the right to be happy about your baby. She does need therapy I agree but I feel that she is too self centered to care about anyone else\u2019s joy. She\u2019s looking to make everything about her.", "NTA, so what stunt is she going to pull next year when it\u2019s baby\u2019s first Christmas?", "ESH - I think there was no winning on this situation. Had you let her know before hand to process the news you don\u2019t know that she wouldn\u2019t of reacted badly. It\u2019s easy for her to say she\u2019d of been happy but you don\u2019t know. You made a decision to announce when you did and it\u2019s backfired. You might of been better not doing it at a Christmas Day get together, and done it all privately and separately.", "ESH\nSIL reaped the rewards of her past behaivior and her text implies she needs therapy if for no other resson than to deal with her grief\n\nBrother - where was he in all this? I\u2019m guessing you guys aren\u2019t close or he would have said something Christmas day\n\nYou - in what world did you think this wouldn\u2019t ruin xmas? You said you only answered questions when asked but did you change out of your tshirt? You wore a billboard that she had to look at. I would have spilled something on your shirt and then left. Also, why Christmas? You knew what you were doing was hurtful. Own it. And maybe get some therapy yourself about your lack of compassion, relationship with your brother/family and need for attention.\n\nThat said, congratulations on the baby.", "ESH", "INFO: how recently was the last miscarriage?", "Yeah YTA. It's pretty basic common sense to not spring a pregnancy on people suffering from infertility. Like she said, a heads up text or call would've been so easy and solved the problem. You must be exceptionally dense if you can't realise that they might've wanted to process their envy in private so that they could focus on being happy for you in company.\n\nI've dealt with infertility for a long time and all of my pregnant friends did this automatically. It's just common sense, seriously.\n\nThat said I do think her text was over the top. But the sentiment is valid.", "While I sense a bit of resentment and bitterness from OP as a sibling, the sister\u2019s text was also marinated in selfishness. So I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say ESH cause we can all learn to be kinder and extend a little more grace to one another.", "Grieving is ok. Crying in the bathroom or leaving earlier is ok. But demanding anything from people because of your grief is not. Sending texts like that to a pregnant woman celebrating one of the happiest things in her life is not. That\u2019s a truly shitty attempt to ruin the celebration just because you can\u2019t have the same, and that\u2019s what\u2019s called an asshole move in my world. \n\nNTA.", "YTA, you knew she has had six miscarriages, SIX. A heads up would have been the kind thing to do. Especially during the holidays.", "Absolutely YTA. You knew this would be hard for her emotionally so you SURPRISED HER WITH T SHIRTS. Holy shit. If she\u2019s been struggling with infertility for years, it\u2019s 100% reasonable to expect that her family won\u2019t do wildly insensitive surprise shit during the holidays. Her text is completely reasonable. You are awful.", "NTA, yes the subject is sensitive for her but you're allowed to be happy and enjoy your own good news.\nCongratulations!", "So you brainstorm about pregnancy announcement ideas, you feel really chuffed with yourselves to go for the t shirt method on Christmas. \nYou design the shirts, you pick the shirts up from shirt printing store, you put them on, and reveal them.\nAt any point did either of you think \"hey should we give SIL a heads up? You know she's been through it with pregnancies\" \nNa fuck it! \nNo her emotions are not your responsibility, and no your joy shouldn't be diminished by someone else's grief.\nBut fuck me read the room and spend 2 seconds of your time just being aware of how your actions may impact other people.", "NTA. Contrary to her apparent belief, it *isn't* all about her.", "Esh", "Nta i would of gone oh brill then we wont get events ruined by your attention seeking self then.", "Esh. You have every right to celebrate being pregnant. HOWEVER\u2026 tshirts? C\u2019mon. Don\u2019t you think you could have done that with your mom separately. You didn\u2019t need her in audience. It really sounds like it was done maliciously", "ESH. Did SIL overreact? Yes, obviously. But T-SHIRTS? Your discussion about sensitivity can\u2019t have gone far if you got T-shirts printed.", "ESH. SIL sounds like a handful and probably wasn't going to react well whenever you chose to announce it, but Xmas is probably a tough time for her thinking about the babies she would have been able to spoil and celebrate with if she hadn't miscarried. YTA for declaring your impending parenthood on a tee shirt. A discreet word to your mum so she knew your happy news, but maybe could have asked to have keep it on the DL until SIL and her husband left would have been more appropriate.   \nCongrats on your new addition.", "So wait... Your SiL is supposedly the one that's attention seeking?  The same one that quietly went into the bathroom and DIDN'T make a scene?  While you and your wife decided to be \"sensitive\" by making t-shirts and wearing them to Christmas to announce your pregnancy?  Without giving your SiL who has had 6 miscarriages any form of heads up?  Are you sure you got the attention seeking one right?  YTA", "Let\u2019s be real. Had you sent a heads up text that would have started a whole other set of problems. It was a lose lose. Congrats on your pregnancy! NTA.", "YTA. \n\nYou had other options here to still let you announce to the REST of the family on Christmas Day. \n\nShe isn\u2019t an AH for having those feelings AND she tried to manage her reaction in private but did you seriously think she wasn\u2019t going to address it with you?\n\nEmotionally insensitive and uncaring. You did NOTHING to show care or support for her in a situation you KNEW would be hard for her regardless.", "YTA. You call SIL an attention seeker when you are the ones who need t-shirts and a group reveal that hijacked Christmas. Hmm.", "ESH. It is clear you don't like your SIL. Maybe its warranted, my brother's child's mother was like that. But you know that it had a high chance of affecting her, and your conclusion was \"we can't let her dictate our lives\". The points she brings up in the texts are valid. Though she does seem to be being extra dramatic and bridge burn-y about it.\n\nIf you had just announced your pregnancy to tour family, I might have knocked it down to not the AH, but with the pageantry of the shirt and the wardrobe change, its just a bit much to have not reached out to them to see if it would bother them.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t need to do the T-shirt\u2019s and if you felt that you really did need to do them, a little kindness never hurt anyone. Could you expect for her to be this hurt? Ehhh arguable either way but at the end of the day you did hurt her by not giving her a heads up.\n\nDid she need to send the text talking about the six miscarriages? Absolutely not. Her triggers are her triggers and personally (as someone who\u2019s had miscarriages and lost their fianc\u00e9 in the same year) she needs to deal with those in a healthy way. And that\u2019s coming from someone who\u2019s been very happy to celebrate other close family members pregnancies.", "YTA.", "NTA, though I am torn between N A H and N T A.\nI do understand SIL and her pain (I had a friend who acted the same way regarding her own difficulties of getting pregnant and got insanely angry whenever someone she knew got pregnant and made it about her), but knowing how SIL likes to talk b.s. about others and always wanting the center of attention, I do feel she is TA for her reaction. However, I feel you could have given her the heads-up out of courtesy with the explanation that you and your wife know how sad SIL had been over losing her babies, but you really wish to celebrate your own pregnancy and hope she could find it in herself to be happy for you and know you wouldn't announce it to spite her. It might not had worked, but then at least you would have done everything you could.\n\nInfertility and miscarriages are sensitive subjects and some people can't handle these things well, so again I do feel for your SIL. And even if I personally feel you could have announced it a little bit better, you did try and had her in mind with how you did it, so I don't think you and your wife are TA.", "YTA seriously, this is the most considerate way to announce the pregnancy you could come up with? I would love to see the options you discarded because I honestly can\u2018t think of a less considerate way to announce your pregnancy. \n\nAlso I personally think it\u2018s quite tacky to announce news like this at a family function you aren\u2019t hosting in the first place but that\u2018s not what makes you an asshole in my eyes, but kinda make me consider if you aren\u2019t the attention seeking one in the family.", "ESH\n\nI don't think SIL should expect everyone to tiptoe around her and her husband's feelings when it comes to pregnancy. BUT choosing to make t-shirts (which are a constant visual reminder for SIL) vs verbally telling your parents moves you into AH territory.", "NTA. SIL is a drama queen. Not to take away from her loss but to deny others the joy of their own family is soul draining. Why should your child be less important?? I would block the woman and not entertain her nonsense any further", "Honestly YTA. Announcing it at Christmas knowing it would ruin her Christmas? Mean. Doing with T-shirts so that she absolutely cannot escape the news for the whole evening because she will see it every time she looks at you?  You wanted her to leave be honest. \"Not gloating just announcing\" with T shirts ???

What you did was insensitive, even if you didn't mean it.", "YTA - you picked a terrible time to announce it where no one could be truly happy for you due to the uncomfortable and sad circumstances of SIL. And the t-shirts, wow, that\u2019s just mean.", "That's a tough one but I'm gonna say NTA. As someone who's had miscarriages before, it really hurts to hear when other people are pregnant when all you want is to be pregnant yourself, but nevertheless I was always happy for them. After all, adding a baby to the family is a good thing.\nAlthough I have to say that you should've texted SIL before Christmas and tell her so she wouldn't be caught off guard. Six pregnancy losses are lot and I can understand the pain.\nCongratulations to you and your wife!", "YTA\n\nThe polite thing to do is give your brother and SIL a heads up. Infertility is very difficult and losing that many pregnancies has likely been traumatic for both of them.\n\nYou can still announce it as a surprise for everyone else. I understand that you dislike your SIL but she's a human being with feelings.", "I'm going with ESH. SIL sounds insufferable with always needing to be the center of attention but come on. Send them a text beforehand. They did go through six miscarriages. That wouldn't have ruined the surprise for anyone else.", "I was fully ready to say Not the AH, but the t-shirt announcement tips it to ESH with a WTF. I think SIL cannot expect others to not get pregnancy and celebrate, but you could have announced it in a less obnoxious way.", "NTA.\n\nHer trauma is not your burden to carry. It's sad that she has had 6 miscarriages, but she has to accept the fact that life moves on around her and she will witness pregnant women all the time regardless of her situation. You deserve to announce when and how you want to. Are you supposed to hide your child from her forever too? I'll probably get DV for this but 6 miscarriages is not \"6 dead children.\" Stillbirths are, but not miscarriages.

SIL text does show how irritating she is, however, as someone who's suffered 4 losses and years if infertility, and who is currently 6 months pregnant with friends and family suffering infertility, I can confirm that announcing in front of the struggling person is thoughtless and hurtful.

It allowed my face to fall without you seeing, because my first thought when I hear about your new baby is my dead babies. Then, by the time I see you, I can make sure that's all filtered out and my focus is 100% happy about you and your new baby.

The fact SIL claims to have \u2018six dead children\u2019 indicates she would not take the news in any format well. And she\u2019s in serious need of grief counselling. I had to deal with 7 colleagues on maternity leave at the same time (in a team of 11), when dealing with my own infertility issues. It\u2019s hard, but it wasn\u2019t their problem.

We finally conceived a baby with IVF in August. Whom passed away in November. I had a second trimester miscarriage which literally ended yesterday. I can certainly relate to SIL\u2019s feelings. If my sister (or SIL if I had one) had sprung a pregnancy on me at an event, I would have been devastated. We are absolutely allowed to be happy for someone else while being sad for ourselves. Emotions are complicated. And sometimes we just need a little bit of privacy to deal with them on our own before dealing with them in public. \n\nWhen my sister DID announce her pregnancy, she had the courtesy, respect, and kindness to tell me about it before announcing it at her son\u2019s birthday party. She gave me a call a few days before to make sure I would be ok at the party. I quickly congratulated her and said I would need to call her back because I knew at that minute I couldn\u2019t be the supportive sister I needed to be. I cried for 10 minutes and called her back to have a proper conversation with her. I won\u2019t lie - that pregnancy was hard on me. Seeing my family interact with her baby (she\u2019s 1 now), knowing they won\u2019t with my baby is hard on me while my miscarriage is so fresh. But I am mostly able to control those emotions around my family because I know what I\u2019m getting in to there. Those emotions are separate from me being happy for my sister (and only a tiny bit jealous) and my love for my niece and nephew. \n\nThere are so many missteps in this scenario, OP. You spoke about how SIL would feel (no mention of Bro, which is crazy because those were his kids that were lost too) beforehand with the announcement, came to the conclusion that she would be upset, then did exactly what you felt like anyways. This isn\u2019t a distant cousin or random neighbour that we are talking about, but YOUR BROTHER and his wife. A pair of people I would assume you want a relationship with. You could have called or texted them beforehand to let them have the dignity of having a private meltdown instead of a public one. But you didn\u2019t. You were with your parents an hour before your brother got there. You could have announced it to the expectant grandparents then, then spoken more privately when your brother arrived, but you didn\u2019t. You could have announced it in a less obnoxious way than t-shirts, which I imagine would have been worn all day reminding the couple any time they looked at you. But you didn\u2019t. You could have chosen to do this any day other than a family holiday, but you didn\u2019t. It would have been so easy to have a sliver of compassion. Your brother and sister-in-law could have been there for you and fully supportive throughout your pregnancy if you had just done something to give them a heads-up. But you chose to think of them, and then not care. This wasn\u2019t a matter of you not realizing they would be hurt. You thought about how they would react and decided that it didn\u2019t matter and you were going to do the exact thing you knew would cause them pain. For that, YTA.", "Completely disagree, after a miscarriage a little bit of notice on a pregnancy announcement goes a long way. \n\nShe would still be happy for them to be having a baby but she would also still be incredibly upset, she\u2019s grieving. \n\nA bit of notice would have allowed her to process the information, be upset in private and compose herself ready for the announcement on the day as she would have got the tears out of her system. \n\nCertainly not unhinged", "I really, REALLY don't understand why not being able to have kids is something that is treated differently from any other 'want' in life. Having a kid is a WANT, not a need. I do not get why people are allowed to go so crazy when if it was ANYTHING ELSE it would be clear they desperately need an intervention.\n\nI get that life can be disappointing. I'm disabled. I can't work, I can hardly leave the house. I experience debilitating pain and fatigue every single day. Do I get a little sad when I see younger family members getting married and buying houses and going travelling and having careers? Of course. It's a reminder of all the things I'll likely never be able to do. But I would NEVER take it out on them or expect them to not announce what was going on in their life because of me. If I went to cry in the bathroom cause someone is healthy and I'm not, everyone would tell me to stop being a selfish brat. But if someone wants a baby suddenly it's okay? I just...

That is so obvious and basic a thing to do. They handed out **pregnancy announcement t shirts to people who\u2019ve had 6 miscarriages!** This could not have been a less tactful way to handle it.

Friend K and I arrived at the same  time and just before I had to put on a brave face and walk into the party, she blurted out to me, \"I'm pregnant!!\"\n\nIt's been five or six years and I'm still bitter that she pulled the rug out from under me RIGHT when I needed to keep my shit together. \n\nOP and his wife are AHs for sure. I think SIL's text strays a bit into AH territory as well but SERIOUSLY, it would've been so easy to text her a heads up.

In her text she specifically says she would have liked a text about it and that she would have been happy for OP. There is a world of difference in being \u201cblindsided\u201d from a text at home where she can cry and be upset and respond emotionally, and being \u201cblindsided\u201d at Christmas dinner in front of your whole family where you have to then go cry in the bathroom.\n\n\nThe news was gonna upset SIL, they knew that 100%, and it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s upset by it.

It doesn\u2019t seem so- If she had gotten the news in private, she wouldn\u2019t have been on the spot having to deal with all the emotions in public. That\u2019s the blindside. Advice is ALWAYS to tell people privately beforehand in a situation like this, not hand them tacky t shirts and expect them to deal. SIL dealt with it as well as anyone could have, she didn\u2019t take any attention and excused herself to be upset. You\u2019re acting like she threw a tantrum in front of everyone.", "Exactly this!!!!", "I am not sure there is a way for people to understand this. How unfair it is to not be allowed to feel their full joy because of someone else's trauma that they had nothing to do with.\n\nPeople will get married in front of widows and divorced people. People will graduate university when others in the family have dropped out. Pregnancies and births are going to happen.\n\nThe world is difficult. Living means there will be hardship and death. \n\nBecause of hardship and death, it is that much more important to be joyful when you can and not to stifle it. Empathetic people will recognize that joy is just as valid an emotion as sadness. As long as it is not in an inappropriate place, let them feel their joy unrestrained.", "And she gets those pets to fill a void each time, not to try and steal attention.

The holiday isn't just about them simply because they're at a good point in life and brother and SIL aren't. \n\nOP claims that SIL is desperate for attention and tries to force attention to herself, but that's exactly what OP was doing here at the expense of his own brother and his SIL. They **knew** this would trigger them. They knew this would **hurt** them. They claim they're walking on eggshells and dealing with dictators while making bedazzled t-shirts to surprise an announcement at a holiday that's meant for everyone to enjoy - not just them. Op claims SIL is melodromatic and attention-seeking, when in reality when she was triggered while her emotional guard was down and she was having a good time she made the very gracious choice of removing herself from the space without saying a single word. And in that text she sent she also described how they kept talking about the pregnancy throughout the entire celebration. The timeline basically went: they barely waited until gift opening was over for them to make the **rest of the day** entirely about themselves at the expense of others. This didn't end at the t-shirt announcement. It went on for the whole day. I see that as apathetic at best, and intentionally malicious at worst. They didn't even have the decency to tell them ahead of time that they intended to co-opt a holiday time that these two were looking forward to so at the very least they could have made the decision for themselves how they wanted to safeguard their emotions or if they even wanted to participate in this gathering with the knowledge that this was going to happen. \n\nYou're repeatedly trying to justify OP's behavior by emphasizing that SIL isn't in a healthy or stable mental state. No shit she isn't, and it's because of them. She wouldn't be in such a state during an otherwise happy holiday if they had acted with basic consideration towards her and Op's brother leading up to the holidays by informing them ahead of time, or simply making their announcement on the 23rd or the 26th instead. It's a selfish claim to say that people should have the luxury of not confronting the consequences of their terrible decision-making of **knowingly** triggering somebody. \n\nWhy are SIL and brother so undeserving of having a happy holiday in your eyes? \n\nOP and his wife also need to get therapy real quick before they raise a child with massive entitlement and apathy issues.", "My immediate thought was that you should have warned her in advance.

To the extent that lots of people pretend the holidays aren't happening, avoid being around other people with children, and don't look at social media AT ALL over Christmas because they can't handle seeing other people's children and all the pregnancy announcements either. Now, I think sometimes these people are a little over the top, eg I have been told off for taking my child to IVF appointments when I didn't have childcare, as it is triggering to people in the waiting room. And I am supposed to include a trigger warning on posts if I am going to mention having a living child. But given the level of pain I have seen people experience over the holidays it definitely seems that the way this announcement was done, with T-shirts, and hjacking Christmas, would upset almost everybody experiencing IVF and/or multiple losses. Everybody seems to agree too that they prefer to get a text in advance with baby news, so they can process privately and also decide if they want to skip family events. This is A Thing. SIL didn't behave in an unusual way. This is how a lot of people experiencing infertility and multiple losses react to baby news, especially during the holidays.

He doesn't give any real examples of her attention-seeking behaviour and in this instance she acted maturely and didn't try to take any attention away from them. On the other hand, OP didn't tell her about the announcement in advance, because she might not have come and he and his wife just couldn't handle not being able to rub their happiness in her face, tacky t-shirts and all.

It just makes it seem like you KNEW you didn\u2019t show any care for her and your brother and were justifying it by pointing out she\u2019s been annoying in the past when other people have announced pregnancies. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if you think your SIL is a crap person who isn\u2019t worthy of you making an effort to be kind to her but don\u2019t kid yourself that you did make an effort. \n\nI can\u2019t think of a more casual and uncaring way to tell her than via festive t-shirt.\n\nI\u2019m happy for you and hope the pregnancy goes well. I\u2019m so heartbroken for your SIL and bro. I can\u2019t imagine how painful it would be to suffer six miscarriages while trying to start a family. Truly traumatic and so unfair.", "YTA majorly. \n\nIf you know something is going to trigger grief in someone - the *absolute worst* time is during the holidays. Christmas, New Years. Doesn't matter. Grief hits hard at the holidays for *many* people, you don't need to add to that by surprise triggering more grief. \n\nYour brother and SIL likely were dealing with their grief privately and managing their emotions to be there for Christmas and be able to enjoy it. A surprise like that just ruins the entire holidays. Now, forevermore, this will be the Christmas they look back on as the worst Christmas ever because they couldn't enjoy it. Because of your actions. \n\nOn a personal note: I say the above last part because I've experienced it. My (ex) friends announced their pregnancy in my home on New Years Eve. I couldn't escape for the entire evening, so the only redeeming part of your story OP is that your SIL at least had that going for her.", "You\u2019re a profoundly tacky asshole, OP. \n\nAfter having discussed how to conduct the appropriate announcement, you and your wife resolved to make t-shits and hijack a family holiday - not gloating, of course. \n\nThe correct way to handle the announcement would have been with a phone call to the Brother and a New Year\u2019s message to the family.", "YTA. It was insensitive (Xmas day) and a little bit cruel (rubbing her face in it with T shirts? Really?).", "she's right. you could have announced it with your tacky tshirts in the hour before they got there, then pulled them aside when they arrived to let them know in a muted, considerate way. i don't think that's an unreasonable ask. YTA. you can be excited and happy to announce your pregnancy but you did not have to do it right in front of their faces, and you know that.", "YTA.   She\u2019s right.  Could have given a quick call a few weeks or days before to let them process it.", "YTA. You could have warned her or your brother. You knew it would hurt them and did it anyway.", "YTA. Your wife should have told her first and you guys could have announced it at not-christmas. Wife didn't go to her when she knew she was upset in the bathroom. The t shirts are a lot to spring on someone with this kind of miscarriage trauma instead of just saying, were having a baby BTW. I think the SIL should be happy for you, but she feels blindsided and forgotten. \nAnd taking due dates etc. Is kinda stealing the moment of everyone's Christmas for awhile. I also don't see an issue with someone getting a pet when someone else gets a child as long as the pet owner isn't being rude. It feels a little like, based on your description of SIL, you have already made up your mind about her and didn't care at all about her feelings or fertility issues and are cold hearted.", "YTA for not giving her the consideration of a text beforehand. Or even pulling her aside and letting her know. She is probably so shocked and thrown off she didn\u2019t know what to do, only that she\u2019s very hurt by two people she thought would have the heart to give her some kind of heads up. \n\nAnnouncing at Christmas was absolutely NOT an A move. But you should have said something to her first.", "YTA. But, I have had 2 miscarriages and know how I preferred people handling things like this. I think a private text or communication to the SIL would have been appropriate here for the heads up so she wasn\u2019t taken by surprise. Finding out feels like a gut punch and I can only imagine dealing with that in front of family on what is supposed to be a happy holiday.", "YTA You knew it would hurt. You made t-shirts and announced the pregnancy on Christmas. You didn\u2019t give her or your brother a heads up. She\u2019s had 6 miscarriage.", "YTA. For the timing (Christmas was the wrong day for this, especially because you knew the holidays are already a hard time for her) and for not letting your SIL and brother know about it beforehand. She didn\u2019t even do anything particularly dramatic in response, she just went into the bathroom for a bit to try to collect herself then left early when she couldn\u2019t, but you\u2019re acting like she made a scene. And answering all kinds of questions about the pregnancy IS talking about it for a while. When you saw that your SIL was upset, you should have dropped it until she left. To top it off, you had t-shirts, which served as a reminder of what she couldn\u2019t have every time she looked at you or your wife. So even if you hadn\u2019t been talking about it, she still had that clear reminder. There were so many better and more sensitive ways to handle your announcement and you honestly chose the worst time and way. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your SIL follows through on her threat to not spend the holidays with you anymore because what you did was so incredibly unkind.", "YTA", "YTA. You said you both thought about how to announce, so you made T-shirt\u2019s and surprised everyone on Christmas??? That\u2019s like the most tacky way to do it. You should have texted her privately so she could process before hand. She sounds insufferable, but you absolutely made it way worse.", "YTA \nOp and his brother should have had a private talk about the pregnancy prior. Just a quick heads up. Shirts should not have been made. There are plenty of cute ways to announce your pregnancy that aren\u2019t quite so hurtful imo. Would sil have been pissed and hurt? Possibly but you would have come off looking like a real life caring human instead of an ah.", "YTA. My husband and I have been through this and even hearing an acquaintance or pregnant is difficult. \n\nWhile you should be able to announce things and not feel controlled by another\u2019s feelings, you were insensitive and dismissive of the massive amount of pain infertility and repeatedly losing pregnancies had on someone. It can consume their life and become isolating. \nThis doesn\u2019t mean we weren\u2019t happy for others who were pregnant and able to start their family, but it did usually open up significant pain and suffering in us as well.\n\nYou should have given your brother and sil a heads-up so they could prepare themselves for feeling very strong, very sad emotions.", "YTA because you could have handled this better by giving them a heads-up beforehand. \n\nWas the lengthy text uncalled for? Maybe. Does SIL need therapy? That\u2019s possible but not your problem. \n\nAlso the bit about animals was really weird. I was ready to read that SIL has a full house of cats and that you wanted to find a way to avoid exposing your pregnant wife to toxoplasmosis. Which would be a real concern. But no, just a rather pointless rant.", "YTA  - it\u2019s clear you and your wife have not experienced a pregnancy loss. After having 2 losses myself, I got pregnant again. I knew my husband\u2019s cousin\u2019s wife (who I\u2019ve never met) had multiple losses around the time I got pregnant. I had my husband talk to his aunt to talk to the wife BEFORE we publicly announced so she could grieve in her own way. We showed a woman we\u2019ve never met more consideration than you showed your SIL.", "YTA.", "YTA. I'm sorry OP, I know you tried but.... Nothing about what you did was sensitive. You announced it on Christmas day, in front of a person with infertility issues. Yes, your SIL needs therapy, definitely, but nothing about her reaction here screams 'Attention seeker', like you label her. I don't mean to discredit your evaluation of her character, since you know her and we don't, but her response here seems fairly sane and rational. And, shirts? Really? I thought you guys wanted to be discreet. \n\nYou didn't have to bring it up in front of her and your brother, because it's a holiday. Everyone deserves to be happy during the holidays, and a reminder of past trauma/current difficulty is a sure-fire way of hurting people. You could have either told her before Christmas/text her as she said, or afterwards. You didn't even have to announce it to everyone all at the same time. You could have also told everyone else before she arrived, as she also suggested. You were quite insensitive.", "YTA. As many others have mentioned, it\u2019s not just the failure to give someone a heads up here, it\u2019s the total disregard for the feelings of someone who is going though one of the worst things imaginable. \n\nHave you ever stopped for a second to think of what this couple has been through? One miscarriage is devastating. Six is just unimaginable, and I feel for your SIL and brother beyond anything I can express. \n\nNot only did you not give them a chance to process their emotions beforehand, and the ability to skip out if they felt they couldn\u2019t handle it, but you announced this at Christmas, with bloody t-shirts, and then you have the audacity to describe your SIL as a \u2018centre of attention kind of person\u2019. I mean, what in the name of fuck do you think that makes you?! \n\nThe lack of empathy is utterly astounding, and to add to this you then used a perfectly reasonable, calm and eloquent text to try and make your SIL sound bad? She\u2019s absolutely spot on - if you really couldn\u2019t have the decency to give them a heads up, why the actual hell did you decide to *wait until they had arrived* to make an announcement that you *knew would devastate them*. \n\nYou could have given them them the chance to get their feelings in order and be happy for you, but instead you utterly trashed that relationship. \n\nYou should be deeply, deeply ashamed of yourselves, you irredeemably selfish assholes.", "YTA you could\u2019ve sent a heads up text", "YTA for not giving her a private call or text as a heads up. You had time to make tshirts but not a text? Come on now.", "YTA.  She gets a pet after someone announce a pregnancy and your conclusion is she does it for attention?  Even if you have the emotional IQ of a drunk hippo it should be obvious that she gets pets as a place to put all that grief and need to love.   The fact that you try to portray her sadness as a \"need for attention is really gross\" and makes me wonder what will happen when your baby turns out to be actual work and nor just a source of attention for you. Her text was correct.  It is common courtesy to give someone with a history of miscarriages a heads up for things like this.  Learn to be less awful BEFORE your become responsible for another Han being, please", "YTA. \n\nWhy not warn her?", "YTA. You clearly don't care about her feelings, and you sound like you actually hate her. I think her text was justified. You didn't make it a big deal? Bruh you had SHIRTS made.

Makes more sense that she does it out of grief and trying to fill a hole in her heart.\n\nThat letter sounded honest and rational to me. \n\nAnd yes, the t shirt thing is gloating. And yes, in a similar situation I would have warned them first and given them time to process in private. \n\nOP YTA and I don't think you have much self awareness or compassion.", "YTA. You knowingly brought drama into someone else\u2019s house on a major family holiday. Nothing you say about your SIL can make that okay. It was your job to work around her issues, not set them off with tacky t-shirts.", "YTA. \n\nI've gone through multiple miscarriages as well as a loss this year at 21 weeks. The holidays and family gatherings are especially difficult. \n\nYou knew your brother and SIL would be there. You knew how painful it would be and you still announced the way you did. You could have just as easily announced another time without them there. What you did was callous. \n\nI would imagine after six miscarriages, it would be normal to have some deep trauma that would impact how you interact with other people. Vindicating your decision because your SIL wants to be the centre of attention is bizarre reasoning for what you did. \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy, I hope that it's a healthy, full-term pregnancy that results in a live birth of a healthy baby.

This is not treading on egg shells, this is empathy and giving them a heads up. OP & wife could still announce their pregnancy during the holidays if they wished, but bro & SIL would've been able to choose whether to be there at that point or not, eg. they could've gone for a walk or left before the announcement or just chosen to be there.\n\nEither way, wearing tee shirts to announce it is incredibly crass, IMO. I've never suffered a miscarriage, let alone six, but I could not wear a tee shirt announcing my pregnancy in front of someone who had suffered that. Not classy.

At worst I would say completely tone-deaf, and at worst almost malicious. \n\nThe general etiquette when you know someone in your life is struggling with infertility is to give them a heads up re:announcement and the option to not be present for the more general announcement. If you had done this she may still have reacted badly, but you would not be in the wrong. \n\nIf you want to preserve the relationship you and your wife need to apologies profusely and then give her and your brother some time and space to process without expecting them to immediately forgive you.", "Calling you the AH, at this tine, seems a little harsh.

It was painful for my wife.  You know what she did?\n\nShe hid in the bathroom for about 30 minutes to process it.  Doing so is the opposite of attention-seeking, it\u2019s about needing a place to grieve that doesn\u2019t spoil the moment for someone else.\n\nThe difference here is you *knew* about your SILs miscarriages.  And you rubbed it in her face with no warning.  That\u2019s monstrously AH behavior.\n\nLots of folks on here are saying your SIL needs therapy.

Losing 6 babies is just absolutely horrific.", "Okay first of all, your SIL needs like a *lot* of therapy and my heart hurts for her. \n\nHowever, it would not have changed your announcement in the slightest to give her a heads up. You knew she was gonna react poorly due to her own trauma, that's why you and your spouse discussed it at length. You should've reached out and I can totally see - as someone who has also suffered through loss like that - that getting a t-shirt while not expecting it could be triggering. \n\nI'm gonna go with NAH though.

Think of those first moments you will have together. They have had that 6 times and then had to grieve them.\n\nYou were thoughtless...and yes, a gigantic AH", "YTA. a heads up would be nice to those close to you experiencing infertility. it would be really hard for them to process everything when it\u2019s a surprise.", "I'm part of IVF and infertility subreddits and yea, what she sent your wife is pretty common with women in those groups who have had recurrent miscarriages/losses. Infertility is hard mentally and emotionally, and a lot of women have a hard time separating their feelings of anger, disappointment, and jealousy to be able to be happy for someone else. They are not in the right head space to be happy for you, and that's okay. Please don't hold this against her or let it ruin your relationship. Give her some time to come to terms with everything. She is grieving and trying to come to terms that she still isn't pregnant. \n\nI agree that grief/infertility therapy could be really good for her. \n\nI don't think what she sent you was terrible. She stated why she was hurt and what could've helped avoid the current situation with her feelings. She's not trying to tell you you couldn't announce, just that a heads up would have been nice and I don't think thats an unreasonable ask. \n\nSoft YTA. I don't think you were intentionally malicious but this is a lesson learned for next time. Congratulations on your baby!", "YTA. how anyone else can defend your insensitive actions are truly baffling", "NTA and this coming from someone who lost several pregnancies and never gave birth to a child I could bring home.  There comes a point in time where you have to deal with your infertility issues and not expect others to walk on eggshells.  Yes, some holidays were more difficult than others.  But her issues don't supersede the joy you should be experiencing in announcing and planning for your own children.  Her comment about future holidays is likely because if all goes well, you will have a child next Christmas.  That's on her and she needs to find a way to deal with it.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to tread on eggshells and treat grown family members like babies, especially when you did nothing wrong.

A heads-up would have been the nice thing to do.", "YTA and a giant one at that. I'm just curious why you didn't announce it before your SIL and brother arrived. Clearly you had plenty of time. \nYou gave no heads-up, waited until they arrived to make your announcement, had custom made shirts and you have the gall to say SHE'S an attention seeker.", "She is an AH for not seeking therapy about this. PPD is real regardless of an actual physical presence of a child. Your hormones and body change. Hers changed and never fully developed 6 TIMES. \n\nYou are the asshole for making a damn shirt. Like not wanting to make a big deal of it or anything just casually wear a shirt saying it all day all night so if she wanted to have a convo with you she was forced to stare at your poor choice in clothing ALL NIGHT. What a dick move. Announcing it is one thing. Wearing it and parading it all night is 100% different.", "Well yes, I think YTA. It would have been so easy for you to give her a heads up but you didn't want to do that because you are pissed that SIL always wants to be the center of attention. Announcing a pregnancy on christmas to someone who had 6 miscarriages is cruel.", "In the situation you described YTA - not sure what kind of person your SIL is but it is clear that you have a low opinion of her and you knew it would hurt her but you felt she didn\u2019t deserve compassion.", "YTA. Absolutely you should have given her a heads up text. That\u2019s all she was asking for (which isn\u2019t unhinged) and would have taken two seconds. She is traumatized and you ruined Christmas for her. If you are feeling resentful of her, then imagine trading places. Imagine you\u2019re the one with 6 dead babies and she\u2019s the one who is announcing a pregnancy.", "YTA. You knew it would hurt her - you discussed it ahead of time - and did it anyway. \n\nA little tact and compassion goes a long way. And yes - making t-shirts you both wear is, in fact, gloating.

Self absorbed jack wagons like you are why the world sucks.", "YTA. You announced a pregnancy knowing they\u2019ve struggled on a holiday that\u2019s known to be hard for those struggling with infertility knowing everyone would be talking about it in front of her all day long. You went as far as changing clothes to announce so it wasn\u2019t subtle (definitely came off as gloating) or anything. Like she said y\u2019all had plenty of time to tell family before they arrived and chose to do it with them there. Does she need therapy? Probably because 6 losses is hard. Do you need to be a better sibling/in-law? Also a hard yes.", "YTA people have by far the most compelling argument, so that's my vote\n\n\nOP you fucked up", "YTA\n\nYou should never have announced your pregnancy in front of your sister in law at Christmas. No matter how shitty of a person you think she is, she\u2019s had 6 miscarriages. That\u2019s a pain I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone.\n\nHer text message afterwards was over the top. Instead of focusing on her and her feelings, she went on the attack. But, you do deserve it.", "Going to go with YTA.\n\nHaving had 3 losses ourselves, there are times and moments when the emotions can still feel just as fresh and raw even years later. I cannot imagine the emotions involved in 6 losses. \n\nWhen my niece had her daughter, I couldn\u2019t hold her for the first couple of weeks because one of our losses would have been the same age and it was painful. I had to reprocess the grief again before I could hold her. In no way was I angry or upset about/towards my niece, but I knew I needed to manage my grief first. \n\nSix losses is a lot of grief. I do hope for her sake she\u2019s in therapy to help with the grief as it is very real and can be intense. \n\nI voted YTA because she\u2019s right, a heads up would have been more than appropriate. She could have had time to process her emotions before she got to the party so she could have shared in the joy and excitement with you and the others. I completely understand where she\u2019s coming from and agree with her. Her needing time to grieve first is not about her wanting the be the center of attention. It\u2019s not about her being less excited and happy for you. \n\nGrief over the loss of babies is very, very real. You both owe her an apology and please stop thinking her grief is some way she is seeking to be the center of attention.", "yta.  First, you try to make your sil look bad.  And you offer no proof and then you plan an announcement that you know will hurt her, to make Christmas all about you.  You really exspected her to jump up and down with joy?  And then, she did the best thing she could, she removed herself from the situation.  But that's not good enough for you.", "I won't say YTA because you have every right to enjoy this pregnancy as anyone else. But I won't call your sister TA because I don't know what she is going through. As someone who has had multiple miscarriages I can totally understand what SIL was feeling. However, I would have never reacted this way.thats just me, I can't speak for your SIL she may need some therapy for the trauma she has faced. \n\nI did however refuse to attend any baby showers or visit any new babies during this time due to my mental health.\n\nSo now knowing what I have been through, I could never do an announcement like this ever, especially knowing someone is suffering. \n\nThe way I can explain it to you is, imagine you didn't know how you would be able to feed your kids that week because you are struggling to make ends meet and someone is explaining how good their luxury family vacation was last week. I know it's totally different however that is the feeling I felt when I was suffering. Longing for something that comes so easy to others. \n\nExcept you have to suffer being told your baby no longer has a heartbeat, then having to go through the traumatic experience of delivering that baby at whatever stage of the pregnancy if you don't opt for d&C, confirming all tissue and foetus has expelled from body,  explaining to everyone that you are no longer pregnant, mourning that baby at every mother's day, Christmas, Easter, birthday that could have been. But then trying to do it all again. It's a constant cycle of torture, grief and depression. And the worst time of my life that I never thought I would personally live to recover from. \n\nI think it should be common courtesy that if you know someone is suffering you prepare them in advance. I have done that many times with my pregnancies to women who were also suffering and they really appreciated it. I know I would of had someone confronted me in this manner. \n\nUnfortunately unless you have been through it, you won't know how it feels. \n\nI hope you never understand the feeling and wish you and your wife a healthy pregnancy and a healthy happy little bundle of joy.", "ESH. She should start therapy because obviously what she has been through it is very hard for someone who is trying to become a parent and her trauma shouldn't be your responsibility or your duty to take care of it, and I understand her feeling but the message wasn't the best response of course.\nOn the other hand I don't understand why you had to announce it at an event where it was supposed to be about everyone and to be together to celebrate something compley different. \nBut if you wanted a live reaction from everyone,  idk make a video conference or something, if you wanted to have their attention that much. \n\n It may be also that I simply don't understand the American mentality where you guys make such a big deal out of this and create scenarios on how to announce a pregnancy (same as those gender reveal parties that nobody understands the need outside of usa). \nLike why is it that hard on simply communicating, without any plan or preparations.  But maybe that is just me, but these acts scream attention and make people believe they are more important than they are.", "YTA. First, you bashed your SIL in the post and her reaction was actually VERY understated. She removed herself from the room to have her privacy to express her hurt feelings and grief. Then, rather than ruin the mood of the day, she left since she wasn\u2019t able to plaster on a smile. \n\nSecond, her text was very rational and she was expressing her feelings and her hurt that you showed no empathy for her. She didn\u2019t come across unhinged or irrational. Instead she was trying to communicate how deeply hurt she was that you gave not even ONE thought to how you could\u2019ve shown her an OUNCE of grace. \n\n\nThird, making T-shirts was a VERY in your face way to announce your news in front of someone who has had SIX miscarriages. You say your SIL is attention seeking but making shirts is attention seeking behaviour. \n\nYou have every right to be happy for your pregnancy. And it doesn\u2019t cost you anything in terms of your right to celebration to send her a heads up and show SIL some kindness by acknowledging how hard your news is for her. Nothing she did rose to the level of attention seeking behaviour you slandered her with. Your behaviour instead shows you to be an unreliable narrator who is biased against your SIL and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you just want her to get over her miscarriages bc it makes YOU uncomfortable to have to consider anyone else\u2019s feelings but your own.", "YTA\n\nIt would have been kind to tell her ahead of time. I feel like you'd have been more empathetic if you liked her as a person, but you don't so don't feel the need to treat her well.", "You really should\u2019ve given them a heads up or done it at another time, something less public.\n\nPeople who have long term struggles with fertility and hold loss can experience PTSD akin to that experienced by cancer patients. \n\nIf you knew they\u2019d suffered losses and hay this time of year is hard WHY would you do that in front of them?

YTA", "I have struggled with secondary infertility and couldn't get pregnant for over 5 years after my first born.  When it finally happened, I never announced it on Facebook or in a group setting and called people one on one. I know how much it sucks scrolling past announcements and I kept that in mind for everyone I know struggling. I'm also not over the top and think gender reveals are dumb.\n\nI also have a BIL & SIL struggling with fertility and have had multiple miscarriages. I am not very close with SIL per say but I still keep her in mind, knowing how much it hurts.\n\nT-shirts on Christmas is the last way we would choose to announce it to the family.\n\nSay we did, I know that I wouldn't recieve a text like that after because SIL & BIL are able to show joy about their future niece or nephew\n\nWe know it hurts so we did and do keep them in mind.", "You carefully talked about it and your decision was T-shirts right in front of her, lol WOW.\n\nStill ESH because experiencing loss doesn\u2019t give you the right to dictate other peoples happiness. My husband died 3 weeks before Christmas in 2018.

Therapy isn't some magical thing you go to once and then all your problems just vanish, it's a long process, especially if you've experienced 6 misscarriges. I've only had to go through one, I can't imagine the mental trauma of going through 6, constantly getting your dreams and hopes up over and over only to have them crushed - not to mention the changes your body goes through with hormones, bleeding and everything else...\n\nI think that if you know anyone with any sort of trauma, it's fair to give them a heads up if they're going to be exposed to anything that might trigger it. For example, I have a friend who was attacked by a dog when she was a child. To this day, she's still terrified of dogs, even with therapy.. If I'm inviting her over and I know another friend will bring their dog, I'll let her know so she has time to mentally prepare for it, and maybe we'll put the dog in a separate room or at least make sure it doesn't jump on her and sits on the other side of the room. This doesn't mean that we are hating the dog or somehow telling the other friend that there's anything wrong with her having a dog, it's just respecting that people are different and have different experiences.\n\nEveryone is calling the SIL unhinged, but as someone who went through similar trauma I sort of understand how she feels. She went to family to celebrate christmas and got surprised with this with no time to mentally prepare. A lot of people are just assuming she's jealous, and yeah, that is probably a part of it... but more than anything, talking about pregnancies will probably trigger the trauma and memories of what she's been going through the past years. If she had been given a heads up, she could've had that reaction in her own home where she can cry without feeling ashamed over it. All she's really saying in her message is that she was hurt and would've wanted to be able to know and react to the news earlier so she didn't have to break down crying on christmas with family around. Then with time to process the initial thoughts to her own trauma, she could have focused on OP and the happy news. She feels hurt that OP didn't think about how she would feel, and she probably feels bad that she wasn't able to react to the news the way they deserved to be reacted to. It was an unfortunate situation that could've been avoided with a simple text.

Not like some of the stories I've seen on Reddit.", "I feel as if it would have turned into another fight of not telling SIL (hiding the truth) or ruining Christmas for SIL either way (not coming if being told before they were doing it)", "Hiding it is not the only option. I am sure you know that.", "I think people are choosing to miss this.", "\u201cSomewhere down the road\u201d vs \u201chey check out these t-shirts and merry Christmas are two majorly different things\u201d. \n\nWhat SIL asked for, a heads up, was totally reasonable. It would look like this:\n\n\u201cHey bro, I have some news. I know it\u2019s going to be difficult to hear but we are pregnant. I know how much you and SIL have been through, and I wanted you to be the first to know so you\u2019d have time to process it before everyone starts talking about it. Love you man\u201d", "There\u2019s so much daylight between \u201cwait till child is 10\u201d and wearing announcement t-shirts at a family Xmas gathering with no warning. In fact, SIL asked to be told EARLIER not later. She would have preferred to know beforehand which really any decent person would have done.", "The OP stated that SIL shames others whenever they have good news and lives to be the center of attention. The woman needs to learn that life is just not going to bend for her always. Sounds like OP and his wife are done with her. Others would be as well. Many are taking the miscarriages into account without the other behavior described. There is such a thing as common decency while also not caving to the perpetual trashtalker/victim complex of some people.", "Because it would just piss of Sil and make her think she was specifically being targeted. You can't win with people like her", "Also the fact that they were there an hour before she showed up and had time to announce it then", "I think people are missing that SIL also has a history of getting a new pet **every time someone announces a pregnancy**. What part of that says \"she's coping just fine and is rational and mentally healthy\"?", "This. Such a reasonable request", "Yeah OP says that. And then he describes a woman quietly excusing herself and leaving early. Maybe OP is distorting the truth and is an asshole."]}
