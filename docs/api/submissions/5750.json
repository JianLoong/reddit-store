That sucks, I know, I'm not discounting that at all. That being said she's a center of attention kind of person, she will shit talk other people all day long and try to make herself look like the best person in the room.

We didn't want to upset her but we also didn't feel like it was right to let her dictate our actions and make it impossible to celebrate the life that we're creating. So we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChristmas time, we come over to my mom's place, do present exchange, then change shirts.

You\u2019re excited, sure. But read the room (wife). I cant tell you how much that damaged our relationship, and honestly. I dont know how many holidays I\u2019m going to be there for now because of what you did. What you did was completely selfish and careless. It showed me you really don\u2019t care about me. And honestly, had we gotten a heads up text, I\u2019d be happy for you. But right now? I\u2019m not. You both ruined Christmas for us. Idk why you thought that was such a good idea.

She has the right to feel her feelings and remove herself from a painful situation. \n\nWhat type of person she is has no bearing on this. If it does, you're an unnecessarily cruel person.\n\nYou could've done this in a phone call or in person at a different time, or at the very least given your SIL a heads up. You had other options, which wouldn't have reminded your SIL of 6 entire lifetimes of love that she will never experience.", "YTA\n\nIt's common courtesy to give people who you know will struggle with the announcement a private heads up. How did you talk about this announcement in length and not figure that out? Of course she is going to be hit by a tsunami of pain when she sees your announcement on a t-shirt, for crying out loud.\n\nHad she known, she could have decided not to come or asked you to announce before she arrived so she wouldn't have to be part of all the fuss and could just enjoy Christmas dinner. \n\nOr you could have just done your 'fun' announcement when you were alone with your parents on any other day and called your SIL afterwards. There are so many options that show that you care about her feelings. She is right to be mad, because you've demonstrated that you don't care.", "I\u2019m torn between Y-TA and E-SH. You could have done this a lot more sensitively. Instead you chose to do it in a dramatic, everyone scream and shout way. A big out of the blue and no way to escape giving a raw reaction way. You should have had a quiet word with them and either delayed your announcement to a special meal with just your parents or allowed your sibling and SIL to excuse themselves/hang back a bit. These situations are complicated and nuanced. SIL needs to be reasonable but it could not have hurt you guys or diminished your announcement in the least if you had shown just a little consideration. You forced them into an experience you knew would be painful for them.", "You\u2019re going to get particular responses here from people who probably mostly don\u2019t have kids and haven\u2019t had a miscarriage.\n\nBut if you posted in a pregnancy forum the advice you would have received pretty universally would have been to at least give SIL and brother a private heads up rather than blindsiding them on Christmas with your celebration T-shirts.\n\nI\u2019m sure you have no idea what it is like to have a miscarriage, to go through the physical and mental anguish that goes along with it. \n\nIn general I think announcing at Christmas is kind of tacky because it\u2019s a family holiday and it\u2019s not all about you and IMO it\u2019s kind of shitty to pull all focus to yourselves even if we don\u2019t touch the fact that your SIL has had 6 miscarriages. \n\nBut when you add that fact in along with the fact that you couldn\u2019t even give her a heads up so she could choose not to come or go in better prepared, for me this is a clear YTA.", "Oooh, I'm going to swim against the stream with ESH.\n\nSIL needs serious therapy, but she isn't wrong to feel her feelings.  And you WERE insensitive. \n\nI don't think you were malicious, so I can't go full YTA. But you discussed it beforehand, you both knew it would hurt her, and you did it anyway.\n\nIn a situation that delicate, a call or text to her,  or some other communication would have been more appropriate.  You're excited and deserve your moment in the sun.

Nothing more, nothing less. It's very kind to do so. \n\nSo I guess I think YTA because of this, not because It was announced at Christmas or because SIL had miscarriages.", "You should have warned the family members who had six of their babies die. YTA.  SIL is acting over the top and full on but she is also in immense pain because you shocked her with a very sensitive topic instead of forewarning her. And for the record, I got a puppy after my miscarriage too and it wasn\u2019t for attention but just to hold a little life once more. You\u2019ve obviously never experienced this sort of loss.", "\u201cSo we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.\u201d\n\nYeah, you were gloating.

I do agree with the SIL that they should have gotten a heads up. As someone who has had miscarriages- it doesn\u2019t feel great when people are walking on eggshells for you. But I also get that (maybe) you haven\u2019t experienced this kind of loss - so you\u2019d have no idea. \n\nI think you just apologize and hopefully she (SIL) can move on. But you should def apologize for not just talking to her about it.", "Yta. You could have been sensitive but you chose not to be", "NTA and WOW sil needs severe therapy. Like SEVERE. All of her behavior screams \u201cunhinged\u201d. I feel bad for her but that\u2019s a lot of trauma dumping to aggressively hostile text someone about \u201c6 dead children\u201d. That\u2019s disturbing to hear that. Also she definitely wouldn\u2019t have been happy for you if you texted her before Christmas. It just would\u2019ve been a different reason she was upset! Because it\u2019s not about the timing or the heads up\u2026 it\u2019s just that you guys are pregnant and she\u2019s not. I hope you can encourage your brother to get her help. Congrats on your baby", "YTA.\n\nYour SIL needs help, clearly. Her own infertility issues do not mean you have to tamp down your own joy. \n\nBut you were extremely insensitive, bordering on cruel, popping that on her with no warning in a group setting. You should have told her privately beforehand so it didn't hit her like a Mack truck with other people watching.", "It wasn\u2019t wrong to announce it. But YTA because SIL is right, you were insensitive because you could have given a heads up. It seems like you know this because  you attempt to justify your actions by bad talking you sil in the beginning of your post.", "Yta.

That way they could at least grieve their losses and then put on a happier face in front of the whole family.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do that, so I might have made an E S H judgment, EXCEPT THAT YOU MADE BABY ANNOUNCEMENT T-SHIRTS AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS. That is such an A-Hole move under the circumstances. Like, wow.", "ESH. \n\nWhen publicly announcing a pregnancy in the presence of someone suffering from infertility, the kind and compassionate thing to do is give them a heads up and let them know what\u2019s coming so they could decide if they want to present for the announcement. A call or text a day or two ahead would suffice. Or pick a time when they\u2019re not present and then tell them privately after the fact if you\u2019re worried about them ruining the surprise. You say you and your wife discussed how to go about it in regards to your SIL, but it seems you just decided to disregard her feelings completely. I understand you\u2019re fed up with her attention seeking behavior but 6 miscarriages is a lot of grief and heartbreak and your brother suffered those loses as well. Couldn\u2019t you have at least taken his pain into consideration? \n\nIf SIL truly acts how you describe then she sucks for that. If the text was just an airing of grievances and explaining why she and your brother were hurt, I\u2019d say no big deal but she\u2019s taking a pretty hostile tone towards your wife and it comes off as more of an attack. I understand she\u2019s hurt but she could have said she was happy for you but the announcement brought up a lot of difficult feelings for her and she would have appreciated a heads up.", "YTA. It would have cost $0 and 2 minutes of your time to send SIL a heads up text.", "YTA. Compassion and kindness are free. If you were in her shoes how would you have wanted to be treated. You have every right to announce your baby any way you want. No one can dictate how you announce your pregnancy but a world full of \u2018 I\u2019ll get mine first\u2019, isn\u2019t the one you should want your child to enter into. Your SILs response was not even cruel or mean, just a heartfelt expression of the pain caused. You are here because you know you handled this badly.", "YTA. Anyone who knows anyone who is dealing with infertility (and multiple dead children) knows that the best way to share this type of news is in a way that allows the person to process in private. They can be happy for you but also absolutely fucking devastated for themselves.\n\nThe sensitive thing would have been to call or message them the day before with the news so they could process in private and decide if they could be a positive addition to the celebration. \n\nYou just decided to sideswipe them in the middle of a family celebration. Not cool. Congratulations on your pregnancy OP, but please be more sensitive to people who may have to work through complicated personal emotions in order to celebrate your baby.", "YTA. If your family didn't have someone in it who has buried 6 kids trying to have a baby then this kind of public announcement might be ok. But given the context, it's inconsiderate at best. I don't get the need to make an \"event\" of it. Tell the people who need to know privately and take off the pressure of the \"big public scene\" aspect.", "This is a rough one all around. BUT, knowing that this is a very sensitive issue for brother and SIL, OP definitely could\u2019ve sent a heads up text to brother and let them decide if they wanted to be there for the announcement or not. \nAlso, I think it\u2019s important to highlight that based on the description of SILs reaction day of, she isn\u2019t trying to draw attention to her at all. Instead trying to take herself out of a situation that is probably very traumatic for her, and then once she is unable to pull herself out of a trauma response, taking herself out of the situation.

Giving a heads up would have been the right way to go. I have suffered baby loss and infertility and would have literally just walked out if something like that was sprung on me. Some people might think it selfish of me but, after everything I've been through, I need people to give me a bit more time to process pregnancy announcements.", "INFO So, did you have an hour to tell everyone before SIL arrived? If so, why didn\u2019t you tell them then?", "ESH. Yeah, SIL is overboard. That text is way too much. But she\u2019s also not entirely wrong. You could have let her know just before they were due to come over, or a week ago so she had time to process. My sister just had a miscarriage and we\u2019re TTC and I spend a crazy amount of time thinking about how we\u2019ll tell her.", "When will people learn not to co-opt existing events/holidays?", "YTA. It seems very clear that you, your wife, your brother and your SIL could have all reasonably determined that this news was likely to upset SIL. Her needs and feelings don\u2019t have to come before yours, but as she correctly pointed out in what I think was a very direct but fair text, you could have given her a heads up or announced before they arrived. At a minimum if she knew you planned on announcing your pregnancy at this gathering she could\u2019ve chosen to not be present. You deserve to celebrate and have it be a big deal that you are expecting and it seems like you made choices that turned your announcement into drama and less fun for everyone", "Im thinking maybe ESH. Your SIL definitely needs therapy and that text was over the top but she actually made some good points. A heads up would have been nice. Even though you\u2019re not obligated to do so, giving her and your brother time to process this could have made this better. I just read at least 6 articles and the number one thing they all say to do is to tell them privately and give them time to process before big announcements. Also it wasn\u2019t your intention but the shirts IMO were more gloating than verbally announcing it.", "NTA I think we might secretly have the same family because my sister acts the same way. I've cut contact with her for other reasons but she constantly belittled everything anyone else ever did. You're happy? No your not because I had a shitty day! You're upset? You don't know the meaning of upset because I had the worst week! \n\nPeople like that cannot be pleased and should not dictate your life.

While it\u2019s sad that SIL and your brother are having difficultly conceiving, it\u2019s not right for them to make you seem like bad people for announcing something they were bound to discover anyway. Congratulations on the pregnancy, and i hope all goes well.", "I thought her message was mature and heartfelt and doesn't reflect your description of her past behaviour.

Im all for announcing pregnancy whenever you want. That being said, you absolutely should have warned them/ gave them a head up. You said you had SIL in your thoughts but you really didn\u2019t. Your SIL was very respectful in how she handle it and didn\u2019t seem like the attention whxxx you tried to make her out to be. To me it\u2019s sounds like you did this personally to snub her", "NTA. My husband and I were infertile for 15 years before our son was born. Other people in our lives were allowed to get pregnant, announce it, and be excited. Was it sad for us? Sure. But that didn\u2019t mean the world stopped. The only thing I avoided were baby showers (ironically not because of the expectant couple/baby but because other people always wanted to ask about my family planning plans). You guys were not assholes for being excited.", "First:  You had every right to announce the pregnancy. \n\nBut you could have reasonably expected that your SIL would be upset. You decided that this was your time to be in the limelight and her reaction was that unhinged letter. \n\nShe had the last laugh too by upsetting you and playing drama queen and casting her long dark shadow of 6 losses on your happiness \n\nBest thing is to ignore her 100% NO reaction of any kind. Don't get drawn in by other family members either. You stick together.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy,  it is a wonderful and amazing experience!", "NTA. If you had given her a warning ahead of time, they probably wouldn't have gone to Christmas at all, so in their eyes you would have ruined their Christmas either way. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. It's awful that they've been through so much, but it doesn't mean you don't deserve to be happy, or that they shouldn't be happy for you. It seems like they're so wrapped up in their grief that they can't see the joy of a baby entering the family. Sometimes trauma brings out the worst in us, and people react to situations in ways they regret later.", "NTA honestly, you're not responsible for other people's feelings when it comes to your life.

Also what's up with SIL getting pets when she learns someone's pregnant i don't think that's a healthy way to cope", "NTA. But making and wearing t-shirts to wear at an x-mas party? That is borderline gloating and rubbing it into your SIL's face. Also depending when she had lost her 6th child and especially at what gestation time would hugely depend on how close you are on the line.

Were you supposed to just quietly show up with the new baby in nine months and just not tell anyone so you don't hurt her feelings?   That doesn't make sense to me.

It is on them to build their resilience and to find a way to vocalize and assert their boundaries (within reason) to those around them so that they can participate in family functions without this being such an impactful recurring issue for them.\n\nHowever, you are most certainly an AH here too. They have a valid point in saying that the holidays are hard enough as it is when coping with pain like this and you went ahead and ruined this holiday for them. You did. You did do that. This situation could have been easily avoided or at the very least not as painful for them had you either: spoken to them privately beforehand about your intentions to do a pregnancy reveal during Christmas, or announced it on any day that wasn't Christmas itself. Christmas is about things like family and bonding with family, that doesn't mean \"everybody except the relatives that you don't like that much because they're coping poorly with trauma and loss.\"\n\nGet this, the way you describe the behavior of these two can very much serve as a description of your own behavior. \"she's a center of attention kind of person\" \"try to make herself look like the best person in the room\" It would not be hard to argue that these statements apply pretty easily to what you did over Christmas.\n\nI also note that you described their behavior as: \"If anyone else gets attention she tries to take it away from them, usually by putting them down verbally\" Whereas her actual reaction here was to silently leave and take some space for herself. That's arguably far more mature than immature in terms of what responses could come out of somebody who hasn't recovered at all from their trauma when they're slapped directly in the face with a massive trigger during a day that's supposed to be happy for them. Which I'm sure you also interpret as a ploy for attention. It seems like any response that isn't her pretending to be happy and not traumatized isn't going to be good enough for you and you will find any way you can to twist and warp her behavior into something far worse than it actually is.\n\n>We didn't want to upset her but we also didn't feel like it was right to let her dictate our actions and make it impossible to celebrate the life that we're creating.\n\nHave these people ever directly come up to you and said, \"If you ever get pregnant you're not allowed to tell anybody until we get pregnant?\" \"If you ever get pregnant you're not allowed to celebrate this around family?\" That sure doesn't seem to be the case otherwise those details would've likely been present in your story to emphasize why these two's behavior is just so downright atrocious. You claim you tried so so so hard to be considerate towards these people while they're these horrible unreasonable dictators with you when after all that thought the very reasonable idea of \"let's tell them beforehand so they can at least brace themselves for the announcement during Christmas\" didn't occur to you? A lot of what you've described about these people applies to you. Y'all definitely have a warped perspective about your own behavior and choices here.", "NTA", "YTA If you knew she had 6 miscarriages and didn\u2019t reach out and give her a heads up before announcing it to everyone. It would have given her time to process it in private so she could celebrate with you in public. You should apologize.", "NTA.", "YTA. The kind thing to do would have been to tell her first. Sure you don\u2019t seem to like her and she has some bad personality traits but you should have given them a heads up out of kindness.", "Regardless of how you feel about the SIL's previous reactions or her behavior, the fact remains that the OP KNEW she would be upset, did NOT give her a quiet heads up, and didn't just mention it and let the excitement blow over, THEY PUT IT ON SHIRTS that they then wore for the rest of the day. So they weren't just announcing it, they were rubbing it in people's faces. I think the SIL was justifiably upset and I think she handled it pretty well under the circumstances. She didn't disrupt the holiday, she didn't go on a massive rant. She sent a text that was pretty rational given how she must have been feeling. \nOP, I'd give you a break here if you'd just announced it quietly but the t-shirts? That's a YTA move.", "NTA. You need to text back a diatribe about how she shit talks and has to be the center of attention.

Just ignore her. She'll either move on or continue to give you the silent treatment. Seems like a win either way.", "NTA, OP. You were damned if you do, and damned if you don't. I completely empathize with your SIL, but she was going to be hurt no matter when you announced it. If you gave her the heads up a day before, I doubt that she would have come for Christmas at all. She would have still said that you ruined Christmas for her, because she couldn't bear to be around you, knowing that your wife is expecting. She's upset that you sprang this on her, but she would have been upset no matter how you made the announcement. There are no good ways to announce something like this to someone who clearly carries as much trauma as your SIL does. Even the gentlest of announcements would still have upset her. You have every right to enjoy the announcement, and everyone saying that it was too showy can go eat a sock. You're allowed to be excited, joyous, and yes, showy. Your SIL's trauma is hers to deal with, especially when she would seemingly never be able to find it in herself to be happy for you. Don't let her take away your joy and excitement.", "NTA, why should you have to be secretive because she has health issues. And you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about \u201cblindsiding\u201d anyone, your excitement and wanting to tell your mother are perfectly reasonable. \nThe fact that you had to discuss telling your mother while considering someone else is sad. He and she should be excited for you regardless of their health issues that you did not cause.", "NTA.  What does she especially your wife to do? Hide away the whole pregnancy and when the baby arrives, hide the baby away because SIL can\u2019t have children?

Sil wouldn\u2019t be happy for you either way.  You can\u2019t pause your life to make her happy. Congratulations!", "NTA", "NTA. ignore SIL, do not give her any more attention than you give other people.", "NTA \n\nNo amount of head's-up or informing SIL beforehand would have mattered.

You have no responsibility to her feelings or protecting them. \n\nWatch Gianna rancic interview about having another miscarriage and hearing her sister say she is pregnant for the 4th time . She took her feelings out of it and congratulated her sister, as she should", "NTA, I feel bad for SIL and 6 miscarriages is a lot but she needs therapy, not a heads up. Does she expect every person that gets pregnant in the family to let her know first?  People have babies and why I get that can be hard for her, she needs to work on it not try to drag you two down during your happy moment. She didn\u2019t even say congratulations. I hope you don\u2019t let SIL take this joyful moment away from both of you.", "NTA - would a heads up text have helped? Maybe. But it\u2019s not required. It sounds like she needs serious counseling. She\u2019s not dealing with her fertility issues well.  While she was likely upset, she\u2019s definitely overdramatizing what happened. The whole \u201cI didn\u2019t feel loved \u201c, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it \u201c, calling your wife selfish.  It is self pity and casting herself as a victim. You didn\u2019t do anything to her. You announced your pregnancy.", "NTA. Their infertility really sucks for them, but they need to get a handle on their feelings. Next Christmas there will be a baby that grandma will be doting on. Other holidays throughout the years your kid will be there. You will post happy family pics on social media. And all that will really suck for them, and majorly hurt. That\u2019s how I felt for the many years I went through it before I finally had my son, and that\u2019s how many other people who struggle with fertility issues feel every day. It\u2019s so painful.

Gotta walk on eggshells for SIL right?", "Nta sister needs help", "NTA but have a word with your brother. He needs to make sure his wife understands that her expectations are unrealistic. Expecting that nobody discuss pregnancy without getting her permission is not going to happen, and will leave her without female friends, which will not change if she does finally successfully conceive. Everyone else is not going to wait for her issue to end in successful pregnancy, so she needs to stop expecting that to happen. From a woman who has experienced that loss, your SIL is TA.", "Nta\n \nBut do agree  it would have been a kind thing to do to give her a heads up that you were going to announce so she could process it and not be blind sided or not come if it is that hard for her. \n\nWith that said your not required to do that. It's just a kind thing to do.", "NTA. I had 2 miscarriages before I had my daughter. The second one was twins, so a total of 3 babies.

That's how relationships work. Congratulations on your pregnancy!", "YTA. \n\nI agree with your SIL. You should have told them first privately and then announced it.", "yeah i don\u2019t understand how people can so quickly call SIL the only AH in this situation when OP supposedly tried to keep her in mind only to blindside her with the news of their pregnancy. doesn\u2019t mean there was any malicious intent like you said, but it was a pretty insensitive oversight that i hope OP can be more aware of going forward. \n\nlike there\u2019s a hell of a difference between letting SIL\u2019s struggles prevent you from celebrating the family you are creating and being mindful of how you approach triggering subjects. doesn\u2019t mean you have to bend over backwards to appease her and SIL rightfully so needs to deal with her own pain or disappointment with a licensed professional, but being kind and giving a heads up would\u2019ve cost nothing in this scenario.", "This is it. SIL had a point in her text: OP very well COULD have given her a heads up. That was a reasonable thing to be hurt about. Obviously she\u2019s lashing out and she needs to get help, so I don\u2019t condone her behavior, but it was fair for her to feel hurt by this because they knew it would be hurtful.", "I am really struggling with this as well. The first part of this post is \u201cwe talked about SIL/kept her in mind/discussed how to be sensitive to her loss\u201d then the solution(?) they came up with was to blindside her with tshirts at Christmas in a group reveal. \n\nLike really OP? \n\nHonestly this made me question the rest of the post and OP\u2019s assessment of SIL.", "I was so confused about t-shirt part. OP was all, we don\u2019t want to upset SIL, we just want to announce our pregnancy, but then he and his wife made t-shirts because they were\u2026 not gloating? How does this logic make sense? A simple announcement would just be saying the words \u201cwe\u2019re pregnant.\u201d", "Yeah the shirts are just SO far over the top...we get it, OP likes attention...it's inconsiderate at best and smug gloating at worst. I'd have to be there in person to tell you how bad it was exactly, but it wasn't good either way.", "I am surprised this is the only comment mentioning this. It wasn't a simple sharing of good news--OP had tee-shirts made for a big reveal. It was performative. You go through the trouble to do that and don't do it before SIL arrives or tell her in advance so she can process, that's a choice. An asshole choice.", "100% this. There are so many ways to tell family you're expecting a child that don't involve making merch.", "She is allowed to bask in her pregnancy. Her own pregnancy isn\u2019t about her SIL and she doesn\u2019t need to apologize for her pregnancy or for how she feels about it or for sharing that gleeful feeling with her family.", "Totally agreed. If OP and his wife had just given her a head\u2019s up- and an option to not be present for the announcement- that would have been the kinder approach.", "Disagree.  Absolutely would not give a heads up.  What an incredibly awkward conversation.  Way too hurtful.\n\nThe way OP approached the situation was far more graceful.", "OP legit thinks announcing a pregnancy with t-shirts is a sensitive way to break the news to someone who has suffered SIX miscarriages. You're calling SIL unhinged after her measured response? His judgement of her in the opening paragraph only serves to try and invalidate her feelings and skew our judgement. OP, YTA.", "This! That text was totally unhinged and people are way too busy taking up for the SIL to notice certain details. She placed all of the blame on the wife YET they were at OP's and her husband's mother's house. She then turned it around to make it about her with not going to any functions or that she didn't feel love in that house, which again isn't the wife's fault. She's not entitled to a heads-up and even if she got one, she still would have made it about her.", "Nope. I disagree with your assessment of being \"unhinged\". She grieved privately in the bathroom and excused herself early. She sent a thoughtful and fairly rational text. She does have six dead children. She's driving the point home as to how hurt she's feeling. I agree with her when she says a heads up would have been nice. As someone who has been involved in r/pregnant subs during both successful pregnancies, it doesn't take long before coming across advice on how to break the news of pregnancy to someone close who has only experienced loss. That advice? Send a text. \n\nI've used this advice myself affer reading of other's experience. It worked as well as I had hoped it would. My friend was able to process the news on her own time, respond emotionally without the pressure of feigning excitement, then text me when she was ready. \n\nOP: YTA. It's a holiday. It's meant to be shared amongst those you love. It's something to look forward to and enjoy. Being blindsided with news of someone's pregnancy after SIX miscarriages would be upsetting for anyone in that situation. I think it's fair to come to the conclusion that OP and family were not considerate.\n\nETA - We aren't going to change each other's minds here. I'm no longer responding but I stand by my evaluation. Yes, she needs therapy, but I see a plea for empathy. I see someone who thought in all their time and talks with one another, these are people she thought could understand. She isn't mad at them for getting pregnant. She isn't placing blame for why she can't get pregnant. I see her as someone expressing her level of pain from people she thought would be able to show greater compassion. It didn't happen that way. She's hurt. Hopefully there is room for growth and the family will see better days ahead.", "Yeah I gotta agree with you on one thing for sure \u2014 SIL needs major therapy. I\u2019m tentatively saying N T A for OP because, as someone with diagnosed PTSD from experiencing a lot of death/loss, the person who\u2019s responsible for my triggers is me. I can\u2019t expect the world to tiptoe around me, it\u2019s unreasonable. This goes for SIL too who, of course, has gone through something unimaginable six times over. But, getting coping skills to handle my triggers is why I\u2019m in therapy and it\u2019s helped me IMMENSELY. SIL definitely needs to go to therapy and get coping skills that don\u2019t include sending unhinged text messages like that.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sort of leaning away from N T A but I\u2019m not sure in which direction. Having shirts was kind of a dick move, but again, SIL needs therapy and I don\u2019t think OP and his wife were intentionally trying to goad SIL or shove it in her face.", "It's the t-shirts that put OP in AH territory", "Completely agree with this comment, YTA. You decided you don\u2019t like her personality as tou find it too much. So you used that to justify being inconsiderate. If you she had a character you did like, would you have given her a message to warn her in advance so she had time to process the news? I think you would have handled it differently, and that\u2019s why you gave the context of her being attention seeking. Which means you chose to surprise her rather than warn her. Which makes you an AH. Also the T-shirts are ridiculous. When is anyone ever going to wear them?", "Yes, this. OP is clearly the AH. If he and his wife had taken even two minutes to Google how to approach this sort of situation with sensitivity, they would have seen the common advice mentioned over and over of telling the SIL in private so she had time to process the news. Instead they not only sprang it on her, but they made t-shirts! OP clearly doesn\u2019t like SIL from the way he puts her down as a way to justify what they did. Which is probably why he didn\u2019t care about approaching this with tact.", "SIL also appears to have discussed how hard it is every time someone brings up anything remotely related to either pregnancy or good news of any flavour. SIL was going to be upset no matter when this announcement was made. I empathize with the SIL, that's a tremendous amount of grief to carry, but if the OP wants to announce that they're expecting when the family is gathered together already? That's there prerogative. SIL needs counseling, if she cannot separate their announcement from a personal slight. SIL's situation should not mean that the OP has to lose all of the joy in the fact that they're expecting, and that includes the grandiose announcement. SIL's position is tragic, but the world doesn't stop turning because of it.", "We actually didn't. One person, asides from my brother and SIL, wasn't present until after they got to the house. We wanted the entire family to be there, and I honestly thought being surrounded by loved ones would be the best way to soften the news for her, and we also believed giving an advanced warning wouldn't have changed the situation hence wanting everyone to be there.", "Thank you! The fact that people actually think the SIL is entitled to a heads-up is mind-boggling. She once again made it all about her and threatened not to come to any more family functions and yet people think that was a rational text message?", "My thoughts too", "It's genuinely wild that people are saying NTA here. I would be completely disgusted with OP's behavior if I was one of the people in the room-even if SIL is drama or whatever. It could have cost them five seconds to send a text. And honestly, the text message isn't that bad...she clearly needs therapy, but the point about how OP should have sent her a heads up text was bang on the money.", "I\u2019m so sorry for you and your wife\u2019s struggles but to say that OP is an AH for not giving them a heads up blows my mind. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if OP gave his SIL a heads up as she would have likely skipped Christmas to shift attention back to her. I cannot imagine the pain that OP\u2019s SIL endured but she needs to grow up and realize that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. \n\nNTA.", "What? SIL wrote in her text that she would have liked an head up. Did I miss something or have you interpreted this way wrong?", "She was always going to be blindsided with the news of the pregnancy and there was no circumstance in which she was going to feel handled sensitively or fairly. Her text makes that clear.", "Yeah, the tee-shirts are what firmly planted it into YTA territory for me", "Yes, t-shirts with your pregnancy announcement as a Christmas gift are soooooo graceful. \n\n/s", "Yeah, I don't get some of the comments on here. Even if they did text her, do people honestly believe she would be able to endure seeing the praises and well wishes? People are truly living in lala land.", "As someone who has had three miscarriages and whose friend announced her pregnancy on what would have been the third one\u2019s due date - no. That text was unhinged.

SIL would never be ok with any pregnancy announcement other than her own.  Check her track record in the post.  OP and spouse have no responsibility for SIL's feelings at all.  They don't impact the fact that she is pregnant and still going to have a baby.  Whether it's announced via text or in person does not change the fact at all.\n\nAnd where is Bro in all this?  Not one word from him.  SIL claims to be speaking for both.  That is also very telling.  Plus all the \"me\" and \"I\" statements. SIL would be responding this same way no matter when or how the news was dropped.\n\nI have had miscarriages myself and yes it can be debiliatingly upsetting to hear someone else announcing they are expecting while you are dealing with the aftermath of your own body's failure to sustain the life you want so desperately to carry for 9 months.  I get it.  But OP was damned no matter what she did.  If she gave SIL a heads up text, she wouldn't have come for Christmas and probably told the parents why.  Or she would have sat in the corner crying or bemoaning her sad fate.  Either way, it sucks the joy out of what should be a happy announcement.  \n\nOP is NTA for wanting to spread the happy news.  The AH is, unfortunately, the SIL who made the moment all about her, as OP feared.", "That text was not rational nor welcomed. People have the right to announce their happy news any way they see fit.

I can\u2019t even imagine how heart broken she felt considering she\u2019d had 6 miscarriages.\n\nShe will be excited that you are having a baby and pleased for you but also visibly distraught because of what she\u2019s going through. \n\nThis is certainly not a \u201ccenter of attention\u201d kind of thing. \n\nI had to give up my job for 6 months because I couldn\u2019t bare being around so many babies and pregnant people and tbh I don\u2019t know how long that would have gone on for had I not fell pregnant with my rainbow baby. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t being dictated to, it would have simply have been showing a bit of compassion and understanding for what they are going through.

I know my friends want to get preagnant as well, if they announced it during the celebration, I would be happy for them, but it would hurt like a mf.\n\nUnless the losses happened a while ago (though I assume this is an ongoing thing and they are still trying, which in itself is hard), you ruined the celebration for them. In this situation, it would have been better to choose a different event for the announcement.", "YTA. Infertility is hard, super hard, especially around the holidays. I dread Christmas every year because of family like you. You are incredibly inconsiderate and weirdly sound jealous of your SILs attention for her miscarriages. I promise she would trade in all the attention for a successful pregnancy. \n\nAll you had to do was give her a heads up. That\u2019s it. People with infertility learn to adapt through the pain but it really sucks when people who you are close to, who you\u2019ve shared your pain with do not understand what you are suffering. We don\u2019t expect everyone to stop and adapt their lives for us. We are happy for you, we want you to have a successful pregnancy but we also would like time to process that news in private. To decide whether it is in the best interest of everyone for us to attend something if we think it\u2019ll be too emotional. We don\u2019t want to pull the attention because of emotion. \n\nHow about doing a quick google search to understand how people with infertility feel. There is a reason why it seems like so many people with infertility are irrational or need therapy. We feel like we are screaming into a void that nobody hears or cares to understand. Every where we look there are reminders of what we can\u2019t have. It\u2019s not just having a child it\u2019s every stage of the process. Its completely rewriting our story and what our live will look like. \n\nAdditionally every miscarriage sends your hormones on a roller coaster. \n\nAlso her pets aren\u2019t to steal attention. It\u2019s a way to cope with her pain. I have too many pets and it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve survived the last 3 years. Just because you can\u2019t have a child doesn\u2019t mean the yearning to care and nurture goes away. Sometimes that\u2019s the best you can do. \n\nBefore anyone suggests fertility treatments or adoption just don\u2019t. We\u2019ve all looked into it, we\u2019ve all weighed what is the best decision for ourselves. Both are expensive & take a very long time. Both have extensive exclusion criteria. Neither guarantee a child. They are not an option for everyone.", "YTA\n\nIt would have cost you nothing to send your SIL a text beforehand. You described her as some kind of unhinged crazy cat lady that replaces her sadness with pets and will always take the spotlight - instead, she didn't say anything and left early. Doesn't sound like a drama queen to me?\n\nHer letter also paints a different story. While I do think that she needs therapy, she sounds very composed telling you what other options there were. She's right on every point.\n\nIt's common courtesy to inform people who will obviously be hurt by such an announcement. Instead, you went all out with matching t-shirts. You argue that you didn't talk about it all day, but I'm assuming you wore the t-shirts?", "YTA for not giving her a heads up", "YTA. You made shirts announcing a pregnancy? Yeah, you were gloating. Especially at the holidays. As someone who has suffered multiple miscarriages before my rainbow baby, holidays were the hardest. You're reminded of everything you don't have when you wake up to silence, instead of a baby crying for you or young children excitedly wanting their presents. When you walk into a store and you see the presents advertised for children, and know you have nobody to buy them for. When you see the Christmas adverts with the happy families, and feel like yours is empty. The hardest is when you walk past the baby clothes that say things like: \"My first Christmas!\", and your heart breaks a bit further and it's all you can do not to sob. Because your baby didn't get a first Christmas, they won't get any Christmas, because they died inside of you. Their tiny heart stopped beating right inside of you, and nothing, and I mean *nothing* hurts more than that. You feel as though you failed them, failed yourself, failed your partner, you just feel like a failure and holidays without the baby you've dreamed of so hard and almost unbearable. Then when you're already doing so well to cope through all of that, you have someone waltz in wearing shirts saying they're pregnant, and it's a complete shock and surprise to you? That's like a punch in the face. You could've waited until after the holidays, you could've sent a text first. What you did was down right insensitive to your SIL and *YOUR OWN BROTHER* because he will be feeling that pain too. Wearing those shirts instead of just doing a verbal announcement (and letting them know first) as just a giant \"Look what I have!\". Grow up.", "I'm going to go a little against the grain here and say YTA. Yes, the SIL does probably need therapy to help the grieving process (not because of her reaction, which was very rational imo as well as her text, but because this is a huge loss and therapy will help) but you went about this in a very insensitive way. She has made it known to you how they BOTH feel especially around the holidays. You didn't HAVE to do it on Christmas but I'm not even saying you're the asshole for that. You're the asshole because she's absolutely right in that you should have sent her a courtesy text. It doesn't take very long to send a simple message letting her know in advance. Like she said, she wouldn't have ruined a surprised like that for you. You're both insensitive assholes for not letting them know ahead of time after they let their very valid feelings be known.\nI also completely disagree with the comments saying SIL text was unhinged or uncalled for. She put her feelings into words very rationally and she made it all very clear. She pointed out the 6 dead babies because that's exactly what they are.", "YTA. And you expressed it through a fucking t-shirt. What\u2019s next? A surprise gender reveal right on her front lawn with pink colored confetti raining only on her house?", "She did not seem at all like someone who wanted the spotlight on herself. She went to the bathroom so noone would see her cry, she left early in order not to ruin it for anyone else.\n\nHer text is well phrased, she explained why she would not enjoy your or your wife's company for the foreseeable future, and why she does not feel as if her feelings are considered.\n\n6 miscarriages. Jeesh. Like, I had one, and I am still out of order on Christmas and New Year. On Christmas, and New Year  I was pregnant. And 1 week later, I suddenly wasn't.  And every fucking Christmas I'm  thinking about that.\nI get that you might think 'Its not a real baby, why is she making a big deal out of it?'. And you're right, it's not a baby yet. But it is the possibility of a child, a person, that is in your mind already as soon as you know it is in your belly. And then suddenly that possibility is gone. And she had that 6 times!\n(I noticed you didn't mention when the last one was.)\n\nAnd you claiming you didn't talk about it all evening is bullshit. You had freaking t-shirts made. Which you wore. Which she would have seen all evening.\n\nYTA.\nIt seems like you already don't like her much (as per your first paragraph). And it seems like you wanted everyone to fall over themselves for your luck and since she cannot give you that because she is hurting, you think she is the bad guy here.", "YTA - Beyond me how you went from \u201cwe were trying to be very conscientious and tactful because we knew this would be deeply triggering to SIL.\u201d To \u201cso anyways we made tshirts\u201d \n\nJust send a text. The fact that you didn\u2019t, coupled with the exaggerated description of her at the beginning and the spectacle of it make it sound like you both enjoyed the pain you caused her and don\u2019t want to admit it.", "YTA imo.\n\nHaving struggled with getting pregnant and having miscarriages, I might be a little more sympathetic to SILs feelings than you are, but you have spoken to her about this. You knew her feelings on the matter. It wasn't hard to speak to her beforehand, give her a heads up. We have done so with a few friends who we knew struggled with infertility. It does not ruin a surprise, it gives people the chance to put on a brave face.\n\nTo me you weren't malicious, although I feel mentioning that SIL needs to be centre of attention by getting a pet crosses into 'mean' for me. You realise it is a coping mechanism for her? I realise it isn't healthy, and SIL might want to look into therapy, but her text doesn't make her the AH, nor does her leaving early.", "YTA. You knew this was going to be hard for her and infertility is devastating for those suffering. You could have been more sensitive.", "YTA. That\u2019s the nicest thing I can say.", "YTA, why did you feel it was necessary to announce this at Christmas, and also making shirts for the occasion seems very over the top", "YTA\n\nSIL \u201cshe\u2019s a centre of attention kind of person\u201d she didn\u2019t try to be the centre of attention - she excused herself and left early being unable to cope with the news\n\n\u201cKeeping my SIL in mind\u201d at what point in how you announced it did you keep her in mind not wanting to upset her?\n\n\u201cSo we made t-shirts announcing it\u201d t-shirts?? You didn\u2019t just tell your family your wonderful news, you got it printed for all to continually see, you were 100% gloating with the way you did it.\n\nYour SIL was grieving her 6 losses. Christmas is when she would have been imagining her children opening their presents and having a family. \n\nShe told you she would have appreciated you telling her before hand. That\u2019s all. A 2 minute conversation where you were better people and actually thought about someone other than yourself. \n\nYou are not AHs for announcing your pregnancy. As someone who has lost babies, we understand life goes on and other people will have the news you are desperate to have but it doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t hurt like hell. You are absolutely the AHs for not being kind and telling your SIL before hand and for doing the whole rubbing it in your face t-shirt thing.", "INFO. how much have you tried to put yourself in your brother and SIL's position? You're super excited right now - so were they about their pregnancies. Imagine you lose your baby now. How that feels. Your disappointment. Watching your wife in pain. Now imagine it happening 6 times  And then your brother turns up in a t-shirt announcing his wife's pregnancy, blindsiding you when you were trying to be happy.\n\n\nDid this factor into any of your thinking? Did you consider how you'd want to hear it in his situation?", ">So we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.\n\nYou made tshirts!! Of course you were gloating and rubbing it in. Maybe that wasn't your original intention but a t-shirt definitely screams \"Look at me\" \n\n\n\n>You could\u2019ve sent me a heads up text about this, so we had time to process this. And if your excuse is \u201coh I didnt want it to ruin the surprise for mom\u201d, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s a completely invalid fear. Because I would never ruin a surprise like that.\n\nShe's absolutely right. There's no reason why you couldn't have given her the heads up. She didn't even make a scene just left.", "YTA, not for announcing the pregnancy, but the way you did so. The T-Shirts thing was a dick move.\n\nYou imply that your SIL is an attention seeker, so are you. \n\nYour SIL is right. You could have given them an heads up beforehand.\n\nYou could have even said, \"mom, we wanted to tell you something before Bro and SIL get here,\"  but no. You went for the look at us T-shirts and made SIL really uncomfortable.", "ESH. The SIL is probably really depressed about her six dead children and that's why she tries to bring other people down but you guys could have warned her ahead of time because you knew she would be upset", "NTA. But also, it could have been different. I have a sister who had several miscarriages. She was subject to watching all of our siblings grow their families and she couldn\u2019t carry a child. \n\nWhen I got pregnant, I told her first, in a kind and caring way. I let her react, respond, and grieve once again. After she was okay with it, which I knew she would be, I announced it to the rest of the family. \n\nThat sister is still all about herself. It\u2019s kind of a thing when you don\u2019t have your own kids to be all about. \n\nA little sensitivity can go a long way.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter how they found out, they have had 6 miscarriages, and were never going to be happy for you, because they are not in the right frame of mind to be so. I agree with them that maybe you could have told them previously, or maybe even told your parents after Christmas. But I really don\u2019t think that wouldn\u2019t have also been a \u201cbetrayal\u201d in their minds as well. The tshirts may have been a bad idea.", "NTA, SIL needs to understand that not everything baby related needs to get vetted by her first.  While having miscarriages and not being able to conceive is horrible, you checking in with her before hand would set a bad precedent.  You having a baby doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her not being able to have one.  It seems like you aren\u2019t taunting her or rubbing it in her face.  I\u2019m just not sure why she thinks her feelings are more important than you sharing your happiness", "Nta", "NTA. You did something nice to announce your pregnancy. Lots of people do it on Christmas. Your SIL needs some major therapy though. MISCARRIAGES ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE DEATH OF CHILDREN. And after 6 of them is she finally pursuing another avenue to motherhood? Honestly for her to say that shit hurts and invalidates everyone who has lost ACTUAL children.", "NTA.\n\nSIL:  \u201cHonestly, had we gotten a heads up text, I\u2019d be happy for you\u201d\nNarrator:  \u201cThis was a lie.  SIL will never be happy for OP and wife and will, forever-more, make their pregnancy and their child about her.\u201d\n\nYou are allowed to be excited and enjoy your pregnancy and birth experience and you are allowed to include your family in your excitement and joy.  You are not responsible for your SIL\u2019s issues.", "YTA. \n\nAs someone who has been through similar experiences on both sides. All you needed to do was prep your SIL before you announced it to everyone. \n\nInsensitive AHs.", "NTA. You can't put your life and family aside because of SIL's infertility issues. She needs to get therapy to deal with her trauma.", "Yta, as a person who has two children but also had some fertility issues I can't tell you how cold this is. You knew this was going to be tough for sil so you had t shirts made and you did it in front of them. It sounds like you actually wanted to hurt her. \n\nSeriously don't understand the elaborate pregnancy announcements, what happened to just telling people? First thing you need to learn as a parent is no one cares as much as you do, you don't need a gender reveal, giant baby shower, elaborate pregnancy reveal. If you need to have something specifically made up then that's a big indicator your taking it too far. You could have easily done this when they weren't around. Its clear you don't like sil and it seems like you did it on purpose", "NAH, OP. I see a lot of people saying the opposite, and I can see what they\u2019re saying.\n\nBut that news wasn\u2019t going to be good no matter how she got it. I understand her being hurt and going off to another room if she was overcome. But she was always going to have a hard time with almost every moment of someone else\u2019s pregnancy. She\u2019s been through extreme trauma.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to keep your happy news in the dark. Is she within her rights to be hurt? ABSOLUTELY. But does her hurt mean she is incapable of being happy for you? No. Her hurt feelings aren\u2019t on your shoulders. Your news is not about her.\n\nAgain- she is perfectly within her rights to feel her feelings. But she does not have the right to make it your problem.\n\nShe needs help, and I mean that with no judgement. She has been through a lot and these sorts of feelings are ones she should be talking with a therapist about. She needs to be working through these feelings in a healthy way, not venting them at someone who has what she wants. Maybe talk to your brother about them attending therapy together. Or suggest he float the idea to her of therapy, because anyone who has been through what she\u2019s been through would need help to process and grieve in a way that isn\u2019t self-destructive.\n\nWas she right to trauma dump on you? No. But that doesn\u2019t make her an AH. Just a woman who is struggling in grief.", "Sorry but she has a point \n\nAlso, when was her last miscarriage ?", "YTA for the t-shirts, that's taking things way too far. Had your SIL not been there I'd have said they're just tacky but whatever, wearing a baby announcement on your shirt for the day is OTT in normal circumstances but downright cruel in this particular one. If you'd have just told people with you know, words, like adults usually use to communicate, then that would not have been an AH move at all and maybe you could have enjoyed the holiday with your SIL. This way you made sure she'd have the visuals to deal with just to really rub it in her face.", "NTA, I think you should be able to express your joy.  \nMaybe you could've indeed send her a heads up, but somewhere I think it would not have mattered at all. She wouldve been mad anyway", "NTA. I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re not allowed to share your excitement with your people if you want to. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have shared it with your SIL at all, but it\u2019s a normal thing to discuss when you\u2019re around family.  But why you need to break the news to your sister in law before your own mom is beyond me. I feel like this is the sort of stuff people share at family gatherings. \n\nIs your SIL on the younger side or is she deep in \u00ab\u00a0geriatric pregnancy\u00a0\u00bb territory? If she\u2019s like in her 20s I can see why she\u2019s really freaked out about her situation but if these miscarriages all happened after like age 40, it kind of casts a different light on the situation. \n\nAnyway, people are giving you way too much shit about this. The t shirt idea was goofy though, ngl. Are you from the Midwest?", "NTA. There\u2019s not a way OP could\u2019ve announced it that wouldn\u2019t have hurt her SIL.", "NTA\n\nWhy do they need to prepare themself for it idk they're gonna feel some type of way about news on pregnancies anyway. And that's fine, if you did give a headsup it would've been nice I guess. But their reaction is still over the top.", "NTA. She needs to get over herself. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate how other people celebrate. Yes having miscarriages is sad but she\u2019s being a bit dramatic and selfish. I would honestly ignore her.", "NAH. The way you describe the SIL there was probably no way you were going to win .  If you sent her a text\u2026How could you send something like that so coldly and impersonally.  Didn\u2019t she deserve to hear it in person?  If you only told grandma\u2026What?  It a secret?  My point is that I don\u2019t think you would have found a way that she would have liked.  I\u2019m so sorry she had so many miscarriages but they were not your fault.  But now you can\u2019t be excited about your baby?", "NTA", "NTA, you have the right to be happy about your baby. She does need therapy I agree but I feel that she is too self centered to care about anyone else\u2019s joy. She\u2019s looking to make everything about her.", "NTA, so what stunt is she going to pull next year when it\u2019s baby\u2019s first Christmas?", "ESH - I think there was no winning on this situation. Had you let her know before hand to process the news you don\u2019t know that she wouldn\u2019t of reacted badly. It\u2019s easy for her to say she\u2019d of been happy but you don\u2019t know. You made a decision to announce when you did and it\u2019s backfired. You might of been better not doing it at a Christmas Day get together, and done it all privately and separately.", "ESH\nSIL reaped the rewards of her past behaivior and her text implies she needs therapy if for no other resson than to deal with her grief\n\nBrother - where was he in all this? I\u2019m guessing you guys aren\u2019t close or he would have said something Christmas day\n\nYou - in what world did you think this wouldn\u2019t ruin xmas? You said you only answered questions when asked but did you change out of your tshirt? You wore a billboard that she had to look at. I would have spilled something on your shirt and then left. Also, why Christmas? You knew what you were doing was hurtful. Own it. And maybe get some therapy yourself about your lack of compassion, relationship with your brother/family and need for attention.\n\nThat said, congratulations on the baby.", "ESH", "INFO: how recently was the last miscarriage?", "Yeah YTA. It's pretty basic common sense to not spring a pregnancy on people suffering from infertility. Like she said, a heads up text or call would've been so easy and solved the problem. You must be exceptionally dense if you can't realise that they might've wanted to process their envy in private so that they could focus on being happy for you in company.\n\nI've dealt with infertility for a long time and all of my pregnant friends did this automatically. It's just common sense, seriously.\n\nThat said I do think her text was over the top. But the sentiment is valid.", "While I sense a bit of resentment and bitterness from OP as a sibling, the sister\u2019s text was also marinated in selfishness. So I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say ESH cause we can all learn to be kinder and extend a little more grace to one another.", "Grieving is ok. Crying in the bathroom or leaving earlier is ok. But demanding anything from people because of your grief is not. Sending texts like that to a pregnant woman celebrating one of the happiest things in her life is not. That\u2019s a truly shitty attempt to ruin the celebration just because you can\u2019t have the same, and that\u2019s what\u2019s called an asshole move in my world. \n\nNTA.", "YTA, you knew she has had six miscarriages, SIX. A heads up would have been the kind thing to do. Especially during the holidays.", "Absolutely YTA. You knew this would be hard for her emotionally so you SURPRISED HER WITH T SHIRTS. Holy shit. If she\u2019s been struggling with infertility for years, it\u2019s 100% reasonable to expect that her family won\u2019t do wildly insensitive surprise shit during the holidays. Her text is completely reasonable. You are awful.", "NTA, yes the subject is sensitive for her but you're allowed to be happy and enjoy your own good news.\nCongratulations!", "So you brainstorm about pregnancy announcement ideas, you feel really chuffed with yourselves to go for the t shirt method on Christmas. \nYou design the shirts, you pick the shirts up from shirt printing store, you put them on, and reveal them.\nAt any point did either of you think \"hey should we give SIL a heads up? You know she's been through it with pregnancies\" \nNa fuck it! \nNo her emotions are not your responsibility, and no your joy shouldn't be diminished by someone else's grief.\nBut fuck me read the room and spend 2 seconds of your time just being aware of how your actions may impact other people.", "NTA.

You have every right to celebrate being pregnant. HOWEVER\u2026 tshirts? C\u2019mon. Don\u2019t you think you could have done that with your mom separately. You didn\u2019t need her in audience. It really sounds like it was done maliciously", "ESH. Did SIL overreact? Yes, obviously. But T-SHIRTS? Your discussion about sensitivity can\u2019t have gone far if you got T-shirts printed.", "ESH. SIL sounds like a handful and probably wasn't going to react well whenever you chose to announce it, but Xmas is probably a tough time for her thinking about the babies she would have been able to spoil and celebrate with if she hadn't miscarried.

A discreet word to your mum so she knew your happy news, but maybe could have asked to have keep it on the DL until SIL and her husband left would have been more appropriate.   \nCongrats on your new addition.", "So wait... Your SiL is supposedly the one that's attention seeking?  The same one that quietly went into the bathroom and DIDN'T make a scene?  While you and your wife decided to be \"sensitive\" by making t-shirts and wearing them to Christmas to announce your pregnancy?  Without giving your SiL who has had 6 miscarriages any form of heads up?  Are you sure you got the attention seeking one right?  YTA", "Let\u2019s be real. Had you sent a heads up text that would have started a whole other set of problems. It was a lose lose. Congrats on your pregnancy! NTA.", "YTA. \n\nYou had other options here to still let you announce to the REST of the family on Christmas Day. \n\nShe isn\u2019t an AH for having those feelings AND she tried to manage her reaction in private but did you seriously think she wasn\u2019t going to address it with you?\n\nEmotionally insensitive and uncaring. You did NOTHING to show care or support for her in a situation you KNEW would be hard for her regardless.", "YTA. You call SIL an attention seeker when you are the ones who need t-shirts and a group reveal that hijacked Christmas. Hmm.", "ESH. It is clear you don't like your SIL. Maybe its warranted, my brother's child's mother was like that. But you know that it had a high chance of affecting her, and your conclusion was \"we can't let her dictate our lives\". The points she brings up in the texts are valid. Though she does seem to be being extra dramatic and bridge burn-y about it.\n\nIf you had just announced your pregnancy to tour family, I might have knocked it down to not the AH, but with the pageantry of the shirt and the wardrobe change, its just a bit much to have not reached out to them to see if it would bother them.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t need to do the T-shirt\u2019s and if you felt that you really did need to do them, a little kindness never hurt anyone. Could you expect for her to be this hurt? Ehhh arguable either way but at the end of the day you did hurt her by not giving her a heads up.\n\nDid she need to send the text talking about the six miscarriages? Absolutely not. Her triggers are her triggers and personally (as someone who\u2019s had miscarriages and lost their fianc\u00e9 in the same year) she needs to deal with those in a healthy way. And that\u2019s coming from someone who\u2019s been very happy to celebrate other close family members pregnancies.", "YTA.", "NTA, though I am torn between N A H and N T A.\nI do understand SIL and her pain (I had a friend who acted the same way regarding her own difficulties of getting pregnant and got insanely angry whenever someone she knew got pregnant and made it about her), but knowing how SIL likes to talk b.s. about others and always wanting the center of attention, I do feel she is TA for her reaction. However, I feel you could have given her the heads-up out of courtesy with the explanation that you and your wife know how sad SIL had been over losing her babies, but you really wish to celebrate your own pregnancy and hope she could find it in herself to be happy for you and know you wouldn't announce it to spite her. It might not had worked, but then at least you would have done everything you could.\n\nInfertility and miscarriages are sensitive subjects and some people can't handle these things well, so again I do feel for your SIL. And even if I personally feel you could have announced it a little bit better, you did try and had her in mind with how you did it, so I don't think you and your wife are TA.", "YTA seriously, this is the most considerate way to announce the pregnancy you could come up with? I would love to see the options you discarded because I honestly can\u2018t think of a less considerate way to announce your pregnancy. \n\nAlso I personally think it\u2018s quite tacky to announce news like this at a family function you aren\u2019t hosting in the first place but that\u2018s not what makes you an asshole in my eyes, but kinda make me consider if you aren\u2019t the attention seeking one in the family.", "ESH\n\nI don't think SIL should expect everyone to tiptoe around her and her husband's feelings when it comes to pregnancy. BUT choosing to make t-shirts (which are a constant visual reminder for SIL) vs verbally telling your parents moves you into AH territory.", "NTA. SIL is a drama queen. Not to take away from her loss but to deny others the joy of their own family is soul draining. Why should your child be less important?? I would block the woman and not entertain her nonsense any further", "Honestly YTA. Announcing it at Christmas knowing it would ruin her Christmas? Mean. Doing with T-shirts so that she absolutely cannot escape the news for the whole evening because she will see it every time she looks at you?  You wanted her to leave be honest. \"Not gloating just announcing\" with T shirts ???

What you did was insensitive, even if you didn't mean it.", "YTA - you picked a terrible time to announce it where no one could be truly happy for you due to the uncomfortable and sad circumstances of SIL. And the t-shirts, wow, that\u2019s just mean.", "That's a tough one but I'm gonna say NTA. As someone who's had miscarriages before, it really hurts to hear when other people are pregnant when all you want is to be pregnant yourself, but nevertheless I was always happy for them. After all, adding a baby to the family is a good thing.\nAlthough I have to say that you should've texted SIL before Christmas and tell her so she wouldn't be caught off guard. Six pregnancy losses are lot and I can understand the pain.\nCongratulations to you and your wife!", "YTA\n\nThe polite thing to do is give your brother and SIL a heads up. Infertility is very difficult and losing that many pregnancies has likely been traumatic for both of them.\n\nYou can still announce it as a surprise for everyone else. I understand that you dislike your SIL but she's a human being with feelings.", "I'm going with ESH. SIL sounds insufferable with always needing to be the center of attention but come on. Send them a text beforehand. They did go through six miscarriages. That wouldn't have ruined the surprise for anyone else.", "I was fully ready to say Not the AH, but the t-shirt announcement tips it to ESH with a WTF. I think SIL cannot expect others to not get pregnancy and celebrate, but you could have announced it in a less obnoxious way.", "NTA.\n\nHer trauma is not your burden to carry. It's sad that she has had 6 miscarriages, but she has to accept the fact that life moves on around her and she will witness pregnant women all the time regardless of her situation. You deserve to announce when and how you want to. Are you supposed to hide your child from her forever too? I'll probably get DV for this but 6 miscarriages is not \"6 dead children.\" Stillbirths are, but not miscarriages. She said that as an emotional manipulation tactic to drive home her point and hurt you. Her angered is misplaced.\n\nIf she is THIS affected by your pregnancy announcement, then SHE needs therapy. Bad. She would have been upset still even if you told her ahead of time. It's not the announcement she is triggered by, it's your pregnancy. \n\nCongratulations.

The fact SIL claims to have \u2018six dead children\u2019 indicates she would not take the news in any format well. And she\u2019s in serious need of grief counselling. I had to deal with 7 colleagues on maternity leave at the same time (in a team of 11), when dealing with my own infertility issues. It\u2019s hard, but it wasn\u2019t their problem.

We finally conceived a baby with IVF in August. Whom passed away in November. I had a second trimester miscarriage which literally ended yesterday. I can certainly relate to SIL\u2019s feelings. If my sister (or SIL if I had one) had sprung a pregnancy on me at an event, I would have been devastated. We are absolutely allowed to be happy for someone else while being sad for ourselves. Emotions are complicated. And sometimes we just need a little bit of privacy to deal with them on our own before dealing with them in public. \n\nWhen my sister DID announce her pregnancy, she had the courtesy, respect, and kindness to tell me about it before announcing it at her son\u2019s birthday party. She gave me a call a few days before to make sure I would be ok at the party. I quickly congratulated her and said I would need to call her back because I knew at that minute I couldn\u2019t be the supportive sister I needed to be. I cried for 10 minutes and called her back to have a proper conversation with her. I won\u2019t lie - that pregnancy was hard on me. Seeing my family interact with her baby (she\u2019s 1 now), knowing they won\u2019t with my baby is hard on me while my miscarriage is so fresh.

This isn\u2019t a distant cousin or random neighbour that we are talking about, but YOUR BROTHER and his wife. A pair of people I would assume you want a relationship with. You could have called or texted them beforehand to let them have the dignity of having a private meltdown instead of a public one. But you didn\u2019t. You were with your parents an hour before your brother got there. You could have announced it to the expectant grandparents then, then spoken more privately when your brother arrived, but you didn\u2019t. You could have announced it in a less obnoxious way than t-shirts, which I imagine would have been worn all day reminding the couple any time they looked at you. But you didn\u2019t. You could have chosen to do this any day other than a family holiday, but you didn\u2019t. It would have been so easy to have a sliver of compassion.

I can't work, I can hardly leave the house. I experience debilitating pain and fatigue every single day. Do I get a little sad when I see younger family members getting married and buying houses and going travelling and having careers? Of course. It's a reminder of all the things I'll likely never be able to do. But I would NEVER take it out on them or expect them to not announce what was going on in their life because of me.

Given her record (per OP) she'd probably still find a way to try and make OP sound like an asshole, but she'd have far less to stand on.", "did we read the same text? she specifically mentions that she would\u2019ve preferred a heads up so she would have time to process it and be happy for them. \n\ni absolutely don\u2019t disagree that the rest of her text makes it evident that the problem isn\u2019t just the way OP handled the situation and most likely is an indication that she needs professional help to sort out her trauma and how she processes it\u2014hence ESH instead of YTA. \n\nbut like i said, it wouldn\u2019t have cost OP anything to be kind and give the heads up. that\u2019s not to say SIL would have been magically fine with everything, but it still would\u2019ve been the kind thing to do. \n\nyou can\u2019t control how others react, only how you act. doesn\u2019t mean OP or anyone else should have to walk on eggshells to avoid SIL\u2019s negative reactions, but there\u2019s a hell of a difference between that and just completely blindsiding someone who this would obviously be triggering for. \n\nat the end of the day, the way OP approached the situation was an insensitive oversight, but it doesn\u2019t mean he is necessarily a malicious asshole. he can definitely learn to be more sensitive to SIL whilst still rightfully celebrating their new family.", "Yes but fight or flight would have hit when she found out. I think they should have given her a heads up.", "It is different to recieve the news during an event you thought you could celebrate on and not have to think about what has happened to you than to recieve the news at a time when you can take your time to work through your emotions. Or be able to organically remove yourself from the company of others without them noticing. Leaving in the middle of a party to cry in the bathroom vs going home from just meeting up.", "Her text listed the ways she wouldn\u2019t have been blindsided- and they are the ways that are advised to let people know who have suffered miscarriages. Texting her or her husband while she\u2019s at home and can be upset in private is the most obvious thing to do, rather than hand her a pregnancy t shirt while she\u2019s surrounded by people\u2026!", "SIL sounds like the type of person who would also wail \"how could you send me something like that via text?\"", "My guess is people are taking miscarriage as a pregnancy that ends before the 20th week (definition used in the US), so not as bad as a stillbirth. Still, they are also underestimating the impact that 6 interrupted pregnancies can have on someone's mind", "At some point there\u2019s a grey area between a miscarriage and a stillbirth, we don\u2019t know where SIL was at with hers but I agree, it doesn\u2019t matter. The loss as is as big as she feels it was.\n\nHow far along is OP\u2019s wife in her pregnancy that they made tshirts announcing? If she loses the pregnancy is she allowed to grieve, or is it just a miscarriage that she needs to get over?", "The moment you see that heartbeat it is your child, you can start imagining them in your lives, what they\u2019ll look like, what they\u2019ll be, your family. When you miscarry you aren\u2019t just losing a foetus, you are grieving the loss of your child and the future you started to dream of. \n\nI had a miscarriage and that was bad enough, but I\u2019d hate to imagine how bad it would be to have a stillborn or lose a child.", "Yes, one of my friends had a stillbirth at 9 months and it was horrendous. But OP said miscarriages, so that is what I based my comment on.", "I don't think they were gifts, the wife and husband just changed. otherwise it wld be a terrible way to announce it", "I think people get hurt by people unintentionally. I think she expressed her pain in a reasonable enough way.", "Being pregnant is not the issue.  Given the circumstances, how on Earth was consideration not given to speaking with the SIL privately in advance?", "SIL could have chosen whether or not to participate in family Christmas and could have avoided the event had she gotten a heads up. I don't see how being a bit considerate is a bad thing in this situation.", "She didn't make it all about her though- she sent a text message later expressing her feelings. She's allowed to have feelings. This is just a shitty situation for everyone.", "Yah the 'track record' is one side  of the story told by OP, we don't know the truth so take that 'track record' with a grain of salt", "I wonder if people are missing the fact that the SIL had time to cool off before sending the text. It's not necessarily unhinged if written in the middle of being blindsided and in your feelings. It *is* unhinged to do it once you've had some time to think. \n\nNot giving her a heads up is a bit shitty, given that OP knew it would likely hurt her feelings. Even if she's a drama llama, it's just basic courtesy if you *know* something is going to slap someone in the face. That said, SIL is way out of line with that message, especially the \"feeling unloved\" and shit like that. If this were a pattern of things, maybe, but it sounds like they've been supportive of her and her husband. \n\nBut I'm also not one for announcing shit on the holidays simply because it can turn the holiday into the \"announcer's day\" if you aren't careful (depending on the family). Maybe I've just been in situations before where multiple people have \"big announcements\" that then end up \"competing\" for attention. If you want a big to-do, then schedule a specific time.", "And from here on out SIL can choose to attend/take part in all things baby related. I don't disagree that therapy is a good option.", "The text is pretty rational and I think 99% of people would respond that way. OP is NTA for announcing but SIL is allowed to feel really bad about it and express that. \n\nSaying its not the SIL's business is absurd, they literally announced it to her.", "The T-shirts are a problem for me - definitely gloating", "You think someone asking for a heads-up is irrational? Wow.", "One thing OP should do is to NOT announce the baby's name before the birth!  Just watch SIL throw a fit because the name, whatever they pick, is one that she wanted to use.", "I'm into drama because I was considerate of my friend's feelings?", "I don't see any cursing or any implication of \"yelling.\" I see a response from someone pleading for empathy from a place of deep pain. But I don't see anything that points to \"unhinged\". Can you help me understand?", "We don\u2019t know at what stage the miscarriages occurred.  Forced birthers may very well have considered them children for all we know.", "We once had this discussion at university: when does a fetus become a baby?  It was during a wider discussion on the mechanism of breech labour; does  the buttocks of the baby or the buttocks of the fetus descend and rotate, etc.  \n\nAnyway, no matter what the technical definition it doesn't matter; to a pregnant person it becomes a baby as soon as that second line appears on the pregnancy test.  Families start to dream of what their child will be, who they will look like, what they will sound like, etc.  There's a whole future and many possibilities, and so much love.", "No it\u2019s not, no she doesn\u2019t.  A massive \u2018ta da\u2019 reveal win no warning is insensitive at best and malicious at worst.", "It's reddit so you're gonna get down votes for using trigger warning (and I will say its not really a trigger so much as something that might be upsetting) but your heart is in the right place. As someone who hates being blindsided, having a heads up can be a godsend when dealing with the holidays. Otherwise, I run the risk of being a \"downer\" simply because my initial, stunned reaction isn't super positive looking (usually deer in headlights).", "How is that a great analogy? Baby showers that are a surprise to the *guests* would be pointless; they wouldn\u2019t know to bring gifts. That\u2019s not a shower.", "How do you give a \"heads up\" for news? Information doesn't work that way. At some point she's going to transition from not knowing to knowing. And wherever that happened she'd be \"blindsided\".\n\nIf OP had given her a \"heads up\", she'd have claimed that that heads up blindsided her.\n\n And it's no-one else's responsibility to cater to her ridiculousness anyway. OP's good news is not her bad news and OP and his wife expecting a child is not SIL's miscarriage.", "Exactly this. It's so easy to minimise grief when it's someone else's. If OP loses this baby I can't imagine he'll have quite the same sentiments.", "Fair, I just see people saying miscarriage a lot when they mean stillbirth & am finding OP a bit of an unreliable narrator when it comes to SIL.", "You think it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d to send a pregnant woman a text message about dead babies and personal trauma and self obsession, purely for doing something as normal and everyday as announcing her pregnancy? \n\nIs the pregnant woman personally responsible for the SIL\u2019s infertility? Does their being pregnant impact in any way on SIL\u2019s ability to have children?\n\nAs I said before, SIL\u2019s feelings are valid, she is entitled to her emotions, but our rights have a limit and that limit is when they begin to cross the threshold and begin to impinge on the rights of others to go about their daily lives.", "I lost one child before my eldest was born, and many many more in the 12 heartbreaking years between him and my youngest. I fully understand the pain and grief involved. \n\nI also fully understand how it messes with your head and drags you into a pit of bitterness and jealousy. I get how much it hurts right to the core of your being when someone else gets pregnant so (seemingly) easily.\n\nBut getting pregnant isn\u2019t doing something wrong. Announcing a pregnancy isn\u2019t doing something wrong. OP and his wife are not to blame for SIL\u2019s pain and don\u2019t deserve to be rebuked for sharing their news with the people they love. That\u2019s a perfectly normal thing to do.\n\nCompassion and empathy don\u2019t stop people from going about their normal activities, that\u2019s not compassion, it\u2019s enablement. \n\nThink of it this way, if SIL had been at a restaurant and overheard a stranger\u2019s pregnancy announcement, her emotions would have been triggered just the same amount. Would she have been entitled to subject a random stranger to the diatribe she sent OP\u2019s wife? Would her pain make that justified?\n\nOf course not, so why isn\u2019t her family deserving of the same respect and understanding that would be given to a stranger? Compassion and empathy are a two way street and OP and his wife were not acting maliciously. \n\nIf she had said something like \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you guys, but I\u2019m also struggling with my own emotions right now, so please don\u2019t take it personally if I\u2019m a bit distant while I take time to process\u201d that would\u2019ve been valid, but attacking them isn\u2019t.", "Also OP gave no real examples of her putting people down or wanting to be the center of attention other than she\u2019s got a pet\u2026", "By your own logic there's no true...", "Thank heavens it was a rational response and not an unhinged one then.", "There is no handling differently.  They announced it just as they would normally have done.  That SIL is upset by it doesn't mean they have to temper their happiness or the family's happiness.\n\nAny way that it was announced would have got a similar reaction.  Bet if they had given her a head's up, she would have caused a stink in some way... like not showing up for Christmas.

How would you feel if you went to an event that _turned out_ to be a baby shower. Your pedantry is causing you to fully miss the point.", "I think the six dead children piece is a desperate cry for empathy. It sounds like she expected some from her brother and SIL. She's allowed to feel sad when hearing other people are getting pregnant. No, no one made that happen, and it doesn't seem as though she's placing blame on anyone for her infertility. But I don't think it's outlandish to expect more compassion from a family member. \n\nI've only had one miscarriage. The grief is real and it is painful. Thankfully I went on to have two children but I will never understand the pain of never having even one. Not everyone who experiences loss is going to be able to hold their head high.

If that seems so hard to you I imagine you aren't a very nice person to be around.", "From the sounds of it, I think SIL and wife have a relationship and from the text, it sounds like the wife was the one talking about the baby, not OP and that text is not a blow up, it sounds pretty rational", "Perhaps she sent it to the wife in the expectation that they **might have had a little bit of bloody empathy** for her predicament.", "And people are allowed to feel hurt and express their disappointment. I'm just saying I fail to see what's \"unhinged\".", "What makes you assume that OP and wife had no empathy or sympathy for SIL? Seems the opposite is true since they were quite close up until the pregnancy announcement. Had they shown no empathy or sympathy for SIL thru her six miscarriages that would not be the case. \nThey announced a pregnancy, should they have skipped the t-shirts? Probably. However the SIL\u2019s sadness in no way makes the text to the pregnant woman/not her brother ok. That was cruel.", "I absolutely see both perspectives on this, hell, I\u2019ve lived the SIL\u2019s perspective.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that her actions were wrong. Trauma doesn\u2019t give people the right to early access to other people\u2019s medical information, it doesn\u2019t justify hijacking their life milestones, and it doesn\u2019t make it ok to personally attack a pregnant woman, not even via text.", "After trying to shame people for the millionth time it stops working.
