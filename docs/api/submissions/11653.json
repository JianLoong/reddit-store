I was maid of honor at my best friend\u2019s wedding last weekend and I was determined to make sure it went off without a hitch. \n\nSo the bridesmaids started getting ready at 7 and I was the first one done. My maid of honor sent me to go check on the guys in the grooms suite as the rest of the women finished up because her husband and her friends are admittedly not the best planners so we feared they might not have been budgeting time properly. \n\nWell I get there (after knocking and being let it) and they\u2019re all laughing at this one groomsman \u201cMax\u201d (26m).  He didn\u2019t know you were supposed to get pants altered so his pant legs were comically long. The wedding photos were supposed to start in like an hour at this point. \n\nI am a seamstress as my job so I found the length and told him if he took them off I would alter them for him. He said sure let me just drive back to my place and get sweatpants to wear while I did that. I told them I had literally no time for that and to take them off here so I could fix them now and he\u2019d be ready. \n\nSo he just kind of stood there awkwardly without his pants. I found out later that another groomsmen was pooping in there for like twenty minutes so that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t hide out in there. He was awkward around me at the reception. I think what I did is entirely justified to meet the schedule but all the groomsmen and bridesmaids have since told me I embarrassed the guy. AITA?\n\nEDIT: can\u2019t answer this again lmao.

It's common courtesy for a man to leave the room if a woman undresses and it should be common courtesy for a woman to leave the room if a man undresses.\n\nMax isn't an asshole for being uncomfortable in that situation, and I'd say the easiest solution would have been for OP to leave the room.

I needed to either pin it together or get sewn in.\n\nI was just going to use some safety pins but as it turns out the bride\u2019s uncle-in-law was a tailor and he was the only one with both the time and expertise to sew me into it. \n\nHe was rather curt and bossy because he was pressed for time, so it was indeed a bit awkward, but I\u2019d rather have a legit professional awkwardly sew my boobs in rather than risk having the whole guest list see my nipperonis or walk around with uncomfortable safety pins all night. He did a great job and everything worked out fine!", "NTA, he could have covered up with a towel or pillow case if he was really that shy.\n\nIn his defense, you could have just pinned the hem so he didn't need to take them off or sew in the hallway so he wasn't in the same room as you were pantless.", "What you did was awesome! You solved the problem then and there, but also, you're kind of TA. It's the situation that forced you to be one. It's okay to be TA at times.", "NTA\n\nFellow sewist here. We are the rare group along with doctors and sex workers that get to ask people to take off their pants 5 minutes after we meet them. (Paraphrasing a quotation)", "NTA. You saved the brides sanity whether she knows it or not. Well done.", "NTA - I\u2019m assuming he had his underpants on.", "He was embarrassed?\n\nWho cares. Someday he\u2019ll grow up and realize the answer was no one.", "NTA but I can get being embarrassed.", "You go girl!", "NTA.\n\nThis is badass, ma\u2019am.  True A-team performance.", "Good grief. When I was in high school theater I ended up in the boys\u2019 dressing room for as long as it took to do each of their stage makeup, since they had no idea how to do it. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. You were prepping for an event, not getting intimate. NTA.", "I'm wondering if the genders were reversed we'd see as many YTA and yes, men can be seamsters, like me.\n\nDress doesn't quite fit right? Take it off I'll sort it all the whole some lady walking around clothsless all because I insisted on doing the alteration on the spot.", "You were in a hotel... known for having big cloth things like blankets and fluffy white towels all over the place. If he was embarrassed, and an adult, surely he could have arranged something suitable to his modesty. Or any of the other adults who were present and laughing at him.\n\nHis bashful ineptitude are a distant third place in consideration to getting the photos done for the couple.", "This doesn\u2019t make sense. What did he wear on the way to the venue? And if you were maid of honor, who sent you to check on them? It says maid of honor", "NTA, if he was so uncomfortable why did he just stand there?", "NTA", "NTA if you are a seamstress I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it all before. You had a job to do as MOH and YOU NAILED IT!", "NTA for fixing this sitch in a pinch.", "This is interesting.  However, you were doing him a favor and it's not like u asked him to be nude. Also, asking for a change of pants is absurd.\nHe's not wrong for being unaware of his pants situation but he didn't handle it right either.  Don't worry you did nothing wrong.  In fact you didn't really do anything at all", "NTA. Small dick energy.", "Are you sure it's not anxiety? He didn't have other clothes? There was no towels?", "I was ready to say YTA when I started reading. But you are clearly NTA. Well done.", "NTA", "It\u2019s weird he didn\u2019t wrap a towel or sheet around himself \u2026 NTA", "NTA you practically saved the wedding.", "NTA - it was about the pants being fixed and not trying to embarrass him.  If it's a room I'm sure he could have stood behind a curtain of course not with the window open and the behind showing but rather just covering up in the corner if he wanted more privacy or even asked you to take the pants to another area to sew while the boys hangout in the room.  \n\nPanic bride sees pants off and you sewing - \"No worries, just wanted to make sure they were perfect for your day! Go back to the room, everything is all right.\" Fast needle work. \n\nYou were laser focused on making the wedding go smoothly, so I don't think you're an asshole. But then again, I'm shy but not overly shy about my body where if there's cloth around I'm good to duck behind the bed/chair.  But I knew a girl who when my friend went to hand her something she asked for shut the door hard while changing and didn't want anyone to see her body.  Which we respected, just were caught off guard.", "NTA. It\u2019s your job as the maid of honor to make things go smoothly, and you did exactly that.", "NTA", "This is all thanks to capitalism kiddos. This is why I will stick to the courthouse.", "No. As a seamstress you've seen clients in all states of undress. We have to when we are fitting, altering, and tailoring clothing. We're like nurses. Nudity stops being significant to us. You maybe should have told him this fact. He probably doesn't get undressed around tradespeople normally, but it's common in our trade.", "YTA. If gender was reversed here, all the people saying he should have done this or that would be saying something else. I don't know where you're from, or what's the guy culture but where I come from you did something which is very disrespectful.", "NTA if he really didn\u2019t want to then he wouldn\u2019t have taken them off.", "NTA.  Dude here who has both been a groomsman and had groomsmen.  You are pretty badass.  You handled it like a good NCO and got shit done.  Respect.", "NTA and I don't see a problem. Maybe he's shy but he'll get over it", "NTA. He'll get over the little embarrassment.", "OP is 100% NTA, if someone ran in, altered my pants for me for FREE, right before an important event where I\u2019ll be photographed alongside the groom. I\u2019d be thankful not awkward.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a grown woman. She was perfectly capable of saying \u2018could you step out\u2019 or \u2018let me get a towel  first\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019. \u201c", "Plus he's embarrassed now, but if things went differently he would've potentially been embarrassed for years to come every time someone looked at a photo from that wedding with him in his comically long pants.", "He wasn't selfish; clueless or ignorant maybe  but in no way was he selfish", "Seriously. He was standing in a hotel room that presumably had towels and an entire bed full of sheets and blankets. Heck, there were possibly even robes in the closet. He failed to problem solve the length of his pants before the wedding, and then at the wedding failed to solve something basic like \u201chide under the blankets.\u201d Why should it be on OP to suggest a solution of five-year-old could figure out when she\u2019s got more important responsibilities to focus on?", "There\u2019s this Bob Dylan song called \u201cIdiot Wind\u201d that keeps playing over and over again in my mind as I think about this dude. \u201cWe\u2019re idiots babe. It\u2019s a wonder we can even feed ourselves.\u201d", "Bringing them back to the brides suites means letting the bride find out there is a last minute problem on the wedding day. Part of the job of being a maid of honor is to keep problems far, far away from the bride. OP has stated in comments that she kept the bride from finding out this happened, which I think is a good thing - keep stress down for the couple getting married.", "Apparently he drove there in them.", "She didn't bully him, she just didn't let him leave the venue and risk ruining the pictures. She said \"you can't go home for sweatpants.\" He decided to stand around awkwardly instead of wrapping a towel or sheet around his waist, asking her \"can you step out for a minute so I can hand you the pants and cover myself up?\", or borrowing pants. Those were his choices, not her bullying him.", "Excellent point about the role reversal scenario. He didn\u2019t have to stand there awkwardly waiting and a woman mostly likely would not have done that. Cover up with literally anything laying around and laugh it off. No harm done.", "No. A professional tailor telling you \"we have to be at pictures in one hour, your dress needs to be hemmed, I can do it, but I need the dress off of you\" would not be an AH. I would be profusely thanking him for saving my ass while fashioning myself a toga out of a bedsheet until my dress was ready.", "Why not leave them as is for the photos so he can look like the silly doofus he is?  \n\nI know everyone is different, but I would love an immortal shrine to my friends dumb moment.", "It's because many people don't have actual principles\n\nThey don't see \"it's unfair to make someone disrobe when they are uncomfortable\" and find it wrong.\n\nThey see a guy who make a dumb decision who was uncomfortable doing something most people wouldn't really care about, and the principle of the matter goes out the window.", "He could have covered up with many other things in the room (towel, sheet, jacket) and the rest of the grooms party was there. He stood there awkwardly instead of doing something about it and covering up somehow. He agreed to be in the wedding party which is an agreement to dress accordingly and follow the rules of the ceremony.", "You've never gotten clothes tailored, have you?", "I meant to say the bride sent me it was a typo", "did he walk up and demand you take off your dress in front of him?", "yea man walks in and tells women to take off her dress. you would not have the same opinion.", "He wore the pants to the venue. It was a typo. I am the maid of honor and the bride sent me", "Wish I knew", "Tbh I really don\u2019t know. I was just told after that he was embarrassed. At the time I thought he made the conscious choice to stand around in underwear", "you would certainly change your tune if roles were reversed. a groomsman walks into a womens changing room and demands one of them take off their clothes in front of him.", "I\u2019m so glad we are laughing about sexual assault in this thread.\n\n/sarcasm", "Or shut himself in the bathroom. He had options.", "You did the right fucking thing. It may have been *slightly* embarrassing for him, but that was the result of him doing the least in the days leading up to the wedding. He\u2019ll probably never forget to get pants tailored again. \n\nI had a posse of 26 yr old men mad at me because I wouldn\u2019t give them the room key to put \u201cgay sex shit\u201d (that was their quote to me) in their honeymoon suite. And I ratted them out to the brides mom when they went to the front desk to ask for it. Sorry, bro, no one is being offensive AND pulling a lame prank on my watch. We went up and sprinkled the rose petals from our bouquet and lit some candles. Would do it again in a heartbeat.", "So NTA.  You really helped ensure the big day went smoothly, did not add to the stress on the bride, and made sure everything remained on schedule.  That is a clear good job IMO. If there some no-nonsense boss attitude to get it done, in that situation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue.  As long as you were not being cruel or mean spirited, which definitely does not seem to be the case here, some clear cut direction and action was exactly what the situation warranted.", "This is the way. Shit is going to go wrong, making sure it doesn\u2019t make it to the couple is _supposed_ to be the job of the entire wedding party.", "As a fellow seamstress, NTA. I warn clients we will get cozy and it ain't personal. He FAFO imo", "You are a classy person Toble! NTA", "If I wasn't inclined already I would give you (and the rest of the wedding party) a NTA for this alone", "Oh, god, but wool pants and duct tape in the summer. I only had to suffer 2 days of it but the sweat.", "I wish I had thought of that when I was the quartermaster in the marching band!", "gender has nothing to do with it and she was not expecting him to say yes. you're acting as if she had another motive, she was just trying to help him feel comfortable since other people were laughing at his ill-fitted pants. stop making this more extreme than it was, they were all adults and he needed to communicate his discomfort after he let her tailor the pants.", "Yep!\n\nIn this situation, yes, of course.", "Yeah, I've seen tons of naked ladies. that doesn't mean everyone has to be comfortable with me seeing them", "For Christ sakes. Women have MALE gynos. Not my preference, but I\u2019ve gad a few strange men get all up in my business with a speculum and head light. It\u2019s not fun but you suffer through it for the greater good.", "I got the impression the groomsman was actively pooping at the time. I wouldn't want to stand in a bathroom and watch someone poop for twenty minutes either lol.", "Honestly, I'm getting vibes off this. The absolute interpretation of \"this is the suit I must wear, no alternatives\" plus the mind freeze when uncomfortable (I've got no pants on this is terrible give me back my pants so I can cover up because they are the pants for the suit I must wear) suggests he's not neurotypical to me. \n\nEither way, I wish his friends had thrown him a towel to cover up.", "The pants might not of been as bad as what she's making them out to be. Also buying men's clothes is a pain in the ass. He probably bought the suit off the rack. Last year I had to buy a new suit for work. I had to get a pair of pants that were a little bit too big. Because they didn't have my size. Not every place does alterations. You probably to a place like JCPenney's or Macy's to get his suit. You probably bought what they had.", "The reality of the situation he was in was that either he remove his clothing despite being uncomfortable, or he cause problems for the wedding he's supposed to be a groomsman in due to his own stupidity and lack of planning by looking like a clown as he walks down the aisle and then in all the photos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe pressure isn't really coming from OP, it's the situation he got himself into. When OP said he couldn't leave, what was meant is that if he left, went home, and came back before getting his pants fixed, he would miss the photos for the wedding. THAT'S the pressure. It's not really OPs fault.", "AITA? I busted into the brides suite and demanded a bridesmaid to take off her dress while I altered it. She had to stand there in her underwear.", "OR YTA votes are sensitive to the fact that not every man is comfortable having someone demand his pants and have to stand in front of them in his underwear.", "Victim blaming", "He used it correctly.", "So if I did the same thing to a woman, that would be okay?", "Is this how women should handle creepy men trying to take their clothes off?", "Lol, downvoted for answering my question. Reddit is weird.", "this is actually so strange. you demanded a guy take off his pants in front of you.  YTA certainly. I just dont understand why you would think its okay. if you were a guy and she a girl im sure you would have been thrown out the wedding.", "I wouldn\u2019t call it a \u201cdemand\u201d, but after he finished pinning he let me know that he was ready to get to sewing and that I needed to take off my dress. I already understood the basics of how sewing works and knew that I would need to take it off, and I had made sure I had a robe ready. I promise I wasn\u2019t traumatized. He was very professional.\n\nEdit: and yes, he did technically walk lol", "I meant if you're type A personality is due to anxiety.\n\nAnyway what's done is done and it's awkward. Maybe you should apologize.\n\nI can't believe no one mentioned it to him when he rented or bought the suit.", "my comment has nothing to do with sexual assault??? it was a joke suggesting he\u2019s embarrassed about his underwear choices. i won\u2019t pretend that it\u2019s nice to make jokes about someone\u2019s discomfort at all but i don\u2019t joke about sexual assault, i really hope he wasn\u2019t. so unless you\u2019ve got more info than the post, your making a heavy assumption about this man.", "Why would he wear different clothes and change at the venue?", "Dr. Becky is that you?", "Hell, he could\u2019ve climbed into a bed, under the blankets.  He had lots of options to maintain his privacy. NTA, OP.", "Aaaaand I'm off to write a bad romance novel with this idea. Maybe Sandra Bullock could star in the movie adaptation.", "Right? They're in a hotel. Pull a sheet off the bed and make a toga. Done.", "He could have sat on the floor behind the hotel bed to block the view. Asked her to turn around and sew them in the hall. Like I\u2019m female and if the roles were reversed I\u2019d pass the too long dress out through a crack in the door to the seamstress groomsman. With the lock thing locked if I really was uncomfy.", "As a woman, I don\u2019t give two shits the gender of the person helping me when I have fucked up. Especially when they are engaging in their professional role. It\u2019s why - somehow - male gynecologists exist.", "Huh? \u201cOne of the pants weren\u2019t as bad as what she\u2019s making them out to be\u201d? I literally cannot make sense of this.\n\nYeah, buying suits off the rack isn\u2019t that easy\u2026which is why a lot of places sell those long ass trousers that need alteration. It\u2019s not difficult to get them altered. You just take them to your local dry cleaners and usually they can fix them for you in 24 hours. If not, tailoring shops are a dime a dozen and I\u2019ve even had them do rush jobs while I wait if they are inclined to help you out in an emergency.", "Come on that's way too logical of a question", "\u201cHem in the damn hallway.\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "He\u2019s not a victim of anything besides his own ignorance", "That\u2019s valid but why did you directly respond to my question without answering it. Was that a mistake", "So you don't wrinkle the wedding clothes I guess", "I\u2019ve been matron of honor twice, I\u2019ve never arrived at a wedding dressed nor did any of the groomsmen and bridesmaids\n\nYou get ready there as you have to arrive early to make sure shit is ready and take pics, arriving already dressed is odd to me (esp as anything could happen)", "Because wedding clothes are fancy, expensive, and/or uncomfortable.  Most people want to be in them for as short a time as possible and not risk staining or damaging them.", "I'm unfamiliar with Dr Becky...  is it a compliment or an insult to be compared to her?", "Did OP mention where they were getting ready? For my mom's wedding, we got ready at home and then drove to the church. For my sister's wedding, we all got ready at said church. It may be either situation here, and there may not have been many options for covering up.\n\nDid nobody bring a jacket since it was winter, and I still see snow outside my window? Were there really *no* options that anybody could have offered, or a corner or plant he could hide behind? A table he could sit at?\n\nOP is NTA, but the rest of the party kinda suck for seeing that he was uncomfortable and doing nothing to help.", "\nAs a woman I would never just stand there awkwardly pantsless when I could just ask for a moment to find a towel or bathrobe to cover myself with.\n\nIt\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault (or even something she was aware of) that someone was pooping in the bathroom. This wasn\u2019t a coercive relationship with an unequal power dynamic, he had every ability to ask for a moment to cover himself up and weirdly chose not to.", "You have dry cleaners around you. My town doesn't even have one. I have no idea where you live. But it's a pain in the ass in my area to get clothes altered. People keep forgetting how big America is. Just because there's something in your area doesn't mean they have it everywhere.", "How many weddings have you been to where the clothes DIDNT FIT the day of?  None. Because no one shows up in too long suit pants.", "That\u2019s better.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a grown woman. She could have just said no to taking her clothes off, or covered up.\u201d\n\nSounds ridiculous, right?", "That sounds a lot like rapists excuses. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t want it why didn\u2019t she say no or try to stop me?\u201d", "Why?", "so what would you have done if one of the groomsmen walked into your womens dressing room demanding you or one of them to take off their dress in front of him?", "Exactly, or get them dirty, spill something on them.  It\u2019s just much \u201csafer\u201d to change at the venue to minimize any potential issues.", "The title says it was the groom\u2019s suite. I assume that meant hotel, but I suppose it could just be a getting ready room. The attached bath makes me think it was a hotel.", "Right? He took the pants off himself I'm pretty sure.", "She found the length by asking about his height and inseam.", "If the seamstress was a man Reddit would have tore him to shreds for having a Type A personality lmao.", "I\u2019m not getting \u201cYukon\u201d vibes from this OP. And at any rate, only one of the groomsmen seemed to have any trouble, so this isn\u2019t a tailoring access issue. Honestly, I\u2019m wondering what the fuck is wrong with the groom here. How does he let his buddy show up to his wedding looking like that and not think, \u201cHmmmm. I should probably let someone know about this issue.\u201d", "As someone who sews and could be in either position I would have asked for a moment to remove my dress so it could be fixed and then covered up with a friends clothes or a sheet until the alterations were done. If the tailor was diligently focused on sewing the dress and not staring at me then, while I would be embarrassed at myself for getting in that position, I wouldn\u2019t be mad at them. If the Tailor however wouldn\u2019t let me change in privacy and cover up, and then leered at me that would be a different story. OP probably should have left the room after taking the measurements, but it seemed they were distracted and in a time crunch. The groomsman was only told he couldn\u2019t go home, not that he couldn\u2019t take them off in privacy. It seems neither was really thinking straight. I feel like the groomsman is more embarrassed by the situation and the teasing he probably got from the other groomsmen than OP, but OP is an easy target.\n\nNAH. OP did what had to be done and was only focused on that. The groomsman screwed up and got embarrassed and neither was thinking properly of a way that would have made things more comfortable. None of the groomsmen stepped up either and just laughed at their friend. If anyone are assholes it\u2019s them.\n\nHonestly OP not only saved him more public embarrassment but also probably saved him a pretty penny since altering wedding stuff isn\u2019t all that cheap.", "If I had messed up that badly and thats how it could be fixed I\u2019d suck it up and deal with it", "How does knocking on the door and being admitted = barging in? \n\nShe also didn\u2019t use the quote you attributed to her either. She told them that there was not enough time for him to go home to get sweatpants and he needed to take the pants off there, at the venue.  The guy could have asked her to turn around while he took his pants off, put on a robe, or sheet, or asked for an article of clothing from another groomsmen if he was embarrassed to be in his underwear in front of her.  He also could have gone into the restroom with the pooping groomsman to take off his pants, or to wait while she altered the pants.  There were a lot of options available, other than just standing there in his underwear while she helped correct his mistake of not having his pants tailored.  Just my opinion."]}
