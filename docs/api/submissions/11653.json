He didn\u2019t know you were supposed to get pants altered so his pant legs were comically long. The wedding photos were supposed to start in like an hour at this point. \n\nI am a seamstress as my job so I found the length and told him if he took them off I would alter them for him. He said sure let me just drive back to my place and get sweatpants to wear while I did that. I told them I had literally no time for that and to take them off here so I could fix them now and he\u2019d be ready. \n\nSo he just kind of stood there awkwardly without his pants. I found out later that another groomsmen was pooping in there for like twenty minutes so that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t hide out in there. He was awkward around me at the reception.

He is definitely an AH for not dealing with the problem.\n\nHowever, I still believe there were ways for this to be handled that were less humiliating for him. If someone had or could have acquired safety pins, for example, the pants also could have been pinned, at least for photos and the ceremony. An imperfect solution, but one that would have done the job. You are still TAH because, as you concede, you have tunnel vision and don't think about people around you when it doesn't suit you. In this case, it led to making someone really embarrassed and uncomfortable. That's pretty definitionally AH behavior.", "Have you ever had a suit tailored? They can absolutely hem/quick stitch a fix for this scenario in a pinch while you are wearing the pants. Would it be perfect? No. Camera ready? Yes. But OP has some military bridesmaid toxic attitude that needs to be checked. If she is actually a seamstress she knows deep down taking the pants off was excessive perfectionist bs. That\u2019s why she posted here.", "This isn\u2019t just about covering up. You still have to actually take your clothes off to cover up and someone was in the bathroom pooping.

YOU may be comfortable with this, but not everyone is going to be and you have no right to make that decision for someone", "If that woman completely dropped the ball the way this guy did?
