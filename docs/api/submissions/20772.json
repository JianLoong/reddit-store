I\u2019ll call my boyfriend Fred and his brother Sean.\n\nA couple days before the concert,  Fred and Sean went out drinking, while I was studying for my exam. I\u2019m studying law and had an important exam coming up the next day. Sean was staying at our place (he has 1 month off) and came home by himself very drunk. I asked where Fred was, and Sean said he\u2019d be home soon. Fred came home 30 minutes later. He fell on his bike. Blood everywhere, and he\u2019d hurt his shoulder. I tried waking up Sean to ask for my bike key, so I could go get a bandage for Fred, but he told us to leave him alone. I couldn\u2019t go to the pharmacy then, it was too far away in the middle of the night if I had to walk, so I just took care of my boyfriend and cleaned his wounds.  He didn\u2019t want me to call an ambulance. \n\nFred went to the hospital the next morning, because the pain was too much. Nothing was broken, and he was told to stay home from work and relax his shoulder. We then went to a concert that weekend. I asked him if we should stay home, and told him it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for me. He insisted on going. When we got there, he asked me to stay on his left side through the whole thing. I said I couldn\u2019t promise that, but I\u2019d do my best. I met a friend of mine and was chatting to her, when somebody accidentally bumped into his arm, and he yelled out \u201cyou fucking cunt!\u201d, and now he\u2019s mad at me for not looking after him. His brother went to the concert as well, but everything is my fault now. \n\nI said I\u2019m a little disappointed in his brother because he didn\u2019t help at all and if he was in so much pain, he shouldn\u2019t be going to a concert with thousands of people. Now my boyfriend won\u2019t talk to me at all because I didn\u2019t protect his arm/took care of him and I disrespected his brother.

If this was a GA show you gave him the out to stay home. You are allowed to still have fun at the show you are also attending.
