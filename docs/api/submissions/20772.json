I\u2019m studying law and had an important exam coming up the next day. Sean was staying at our place (he has 1 month off) and came home by himself very drunk. I asked where Fred was, and Sean said he\u2019d be home soon. Fred came home 30 minutes later. He fell on his bike. Blood everywhere, and he\u2019d hurt his shoulder. I tried waking up Sean to ask for my bike key, so I could go get a bandage for Fred, but he told us to leave him alone. I couldn\u2019t go to the pharmacy then, it was too far away in the middle of the night if I had to walk, so I just took care of my boyfriend and cleaned his wounds.  He didn\u2019t want me to call an ambulance. \n\nFred went to the hospital the next morning, because the pain was too much. Nothing was broken, and he was told to stay home from work and relax his shoulder. We then went to a concert that weekend.

His brother went to the concert as well, but everything is my fault now. \n\nI said I\u2019m a little disappointed in his brother because he didn\u2019t help at all and if he was in so much pain, he shouldn\u2019t be going to a concert with thousands of people.
