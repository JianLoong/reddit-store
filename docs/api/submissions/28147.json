You *want* to take 2-3 days a month to do nothing, just for yourself (I think this is completely normal btw, this is known as a \"Sunday\" and people usually get four of them a month lol), but you haven't started it yet. There isn't some set-in-stone plan she's made which your proposed day is conflicting with, like \"I wanna chill out and do nothing on the 23rd, even though you planned to go somewhere with me, I'm ditching that\". She's raising hypotheticals (\"*What if* I want to make plans\", etc.)\n\nI don't know what else is going on in your relationship, but if this situation is exactly the way you've outlined it, then you have a perfect right to have 2-3 days a month to do nothing. If she wants to plan something, it just shouldn't be on one of those days, which is hardly a big hurdle.", "Not at all!  That\u2019s called self care and it\u2019s important to have it when you need it. \n\nI don\u2019t think your GF is the AH either- she seems like she might be struggling to have her needs met without knowing how to communicate it.", "NAH but some things don\u2019t warrant any announcement at all. If you\u2019re planning a self care day on a Friday for example, and your gf asks to make plans a few days prior, you could just say \u201cit\u2019s been a long week - think I\u2019ll just stay in and veg this weekend. How about [other day]?\u201d. \n\nThis is a lot less dramatic than \u201cgoing forward, I\u2019ll be taking 2-3 days a month to myself\u2026 \n\nYou\u2019ve both created something out of nothing here.", "NTA\n\nBurnout is serious,and taking early steps to avoid it is just common sense.", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed some time to yourself.  It's healthy.  You can play what-if games until your GF is blue in the face, but the point is, 2-3 sat or sun of each month is your time.  She can deal.\n\nHowever, that's not a blank check to shirk your chores.  Do your dishes, cook when it's your turn, pick your clothes up off the floor.  No free pass there, my friend.", "NTA my dude. Those days are the fucking best sometimes! I often find if I give myself those kinds of days I give those around me more time and effort the rest of the time.", "NTA - Taking 2-3 days a month to recharge and have some personal time is a reasonable way to prevent burnout, especially considering your busy work schedule and exams. It's essential to prioritize self-care, and your girlfriend should be understanding of your need for this occasional downtime. It's not about excluding her; you've communicated that she's free to do as she pleases during these days. It's essential for both partners in a relationship to have space for self-care and personal time.", "NTA- you aren\u2019t even taking that many days to your self! Your mental health comes before anyone else I\u2019m sorry but how are you going to hang out and make nice plans with your girlfriend if you are not mentally well and drained the fuck out. You\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to entertain your (presumably) grown-ass GF. She is not a guest.  (ETA: I really commend you on your self-awareness and proactive self-care. This is what will keep you from becoming a miserable burned-out shell of a man who your girlfriend complains never has the energy to do things with her anymore.)", "NTA! She should take the opportunity to do the same for herself as well! Encourage her to meet up with some friends or family so that she can have some downtime too! \n\nMaybe once a month you can plan something relaxing for the both of you? Movie day at home with loads of snacks? Couples spa day? Gaming together? This may make her feel more included also.\n\nEven couples who live together need their individual time every now and then! Try to approach the conversation in a calm manner and reassure her that it's not about wanting time away from her.", "NTA\n\nYou have communicated your intentions and she should respect that. As you have also stated that you will still be helping out with the chores and engaging with your partner; you just don't wish to be social I really can't see the problem.\n\nPerhaps ask her if she had anything she wanted to do on her own, any projects, hobbies or social outings with friends etc she had put on the back burner.\n\nThen suggest something special you can do together once you resume dual activities.", "No you need time to yourself- self care is important !", "NTA\n\nYour GF is a big girl and can entertain herself for 2-3 days.\n\nThat she seems unconcerned with your need to decompress is a red flag.", "Ugh, total dependency on someone for your happiness is cringe...  \n\n\nYou aren't wrong for this.. You work hard and noticed YOUR body running down from working. There's nothing wrong with doing nothing 2-3 times a month. If she wants to do something with you, just plan it outside of your days to yourself. You planned those, so it shouldn't be expected that you give up personal time for relationship time. They are NOT the same time dedicated.", "NTA\n\n2-3 days a month is more than reasonable.", "NTA, you can vocalize the need for self care, but you also have another person living with you. She's probably seeing it as \"2-3 days out of the month my bf will ignore me\" so just be a little sensitive to that as well. \n\nBut yeah, you'll need at least 2-3 days a month to yourself if you're starting Baulder's Gate.", "NTA. Your time is yours to do as you please.", "\nNTA- You are not doing nothing, you are relaxing. If you didn't need it every once in a while, you would naturally do something else with your time.\n\nIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, that day to relax is refered to as the sabbath. You, and everyone else was to stay home with your family, relax, and recharge your batteries. They knew what they were about, everyone needs that.", "Your girlfriend is an adult and doesn't need a babysitter. She will be fine.", "NTA - Those are Sundays in my house where we do not do anything we don\u2019t want to do. We sleep we vegetate we recharge we hang out. \n\nNo one has expectations on any the other person - they can ask if someone wants to join them but there\u2019s no judgement if anyone says no.. I like to stay home and read or watch tv or sit in the yard or sleep and my SO will take his classic car out and putter around maybe take kids out to eat if they all want to \u2026 my adult kids do what they feel like doing. Dishes? Nope. Laundry? Nope. Phones? Nope. It\u2019s the no responsibility no nagging nothing day.", "NTA, I live with my girlfriend of 4 years. We have Tuesdays off to spend together, I'm off Wednesdays and she's off Saturdays. We each take our individual days off to do what we want, sometimes that's being together until the other has to work, sometimes it's not. I usually take Wednesdays to ride my motorcycle and I don't have to feel guilty about not being with her. Everyone needs time alone to decompress, sounds like she's being selfish.", "NTA - she could choose to watch movies all day with you or she can do her own thing.", "NTA\n\nTaking care of your mental health is really important, and it can take YEARS to recover from burnout.", "NTA. It's completely reasonable. You have 27+ days of of the month to plan out something with her, jeez.. AND you're communicating that and not just ghosting her for 3 days out of the month.\n\nI used to take a day off every month when kids were in school and husband was at work just to have time to myself with no interruptions. Then hubby would get to calling to chat and finally had to explain, it's not about you, but I really NEED a day a month to myself (really was like 8 hours), not even talking on the phone, lol.", "NTA. My partner and I started doing this a long time ago. Obviously we enjoy doing things that involve going out, or even find some enjoyment in the regular tasks like errands, grocery shopping, you name it. But we are constantly finding time to enjoy individually. She has her She Shed in our place where she can play videogames, watch her movies/tv shows on the projector, read a book, whatever, while I take care of the house and the dogs.\nShe sometimes lets the dogs in so I can do the same by myself in the living room or our bedroom. I understand that is not for everyone, but it does wonders for us.", "If you need this and don\u2019t expect her to leave, not talk to you or something like that, I don\u2019t see the problem. It\u2019s normal to do things separately from each other, healthy even. She needs to let you have this time. NTA at all.", "NTA, but I think a little more communication on your end would help. She sounds like a planner.\n\nYou are off most months, what, 8 days? And you are thinking of recharging for 1/4 of those days, maybe a little more, certainly less than half. And that\u2019s a good thing! Just reiterate to her that you are still open to being social and going out on the other days, but just to check with you before she buys concert tickets, movie tickets, RSVPs for events and parties, etc. And that your mental and physical health are important, and that she is of course free to spend the days you are chilling at home with friends or doing a hobby.", "Are you taking time off work to relax or are you declaring certain weekend days to be your off days? Are you flexible with these days off? Is it just a matter of you wanting to stay home for a weekend or is it that you're holed up in your room all weekend not allowing her to interact with you?\n\nI feel like the range of possibilities is so wide, it's really hard to say who's being unreasonable without more info.", "NTA. Too many people think they HAVE TO DO something all the time.\nOkay, do it. I'm doing something else, self-care.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshe is fine to do the same.", ">She just repeated that I was being unfair by have 2-3 days where I refuse to do anything without any concern for her despite her living with me. I just see it as me needing some time to recharge each month and if my gf asked for the same then I would understand.\n\nDoes she work on the weekends? If so I can understand her feeling frustrated as she won't get to spend as much time with you. \n\nHonestly it is very important to have alone time/recharge. \n\nPerhaps also get some blood work done. Low iron count could be contributing to your feeling of exhaustion.", "Your girlfriend sounds like a proper pain in the backside. I mean how do you have to explain or justify yourself to her? Ugh. Relationships are such a pain.", "NTA, self-recharge time is important. Your gf will also be motivated to become less dependent on someone for her entertainment.", "Plain and simple, NTA.  26+ year veteran nurse here and I need 1 day per week to just recover from working bedside nursing in a large hospital so I can continue to be at my very best at work AND home.

Hugs \ud83e\udd17", "NTA.\n\n>what about if we wanted to make plans\n\n>what about if there was something happening that we wanted to attend\n\nYour girlfriend is being extremely selfish and putting her wants above your needs, not to mention the masquerading of her wants as if they were yours.", "No. I have never understood this about the women I have dated\u2026 \n\nIt always seems like I was their main form of entertainment when we lived together. They hate when a guys hobby doesn\u2019t involve them at all. And rarely seem to have solitary hobbies of their own. \n\nIf they want to lay around all day it\u2019s fine, but if I want a day to do my thing (that doesn\u2019t involve them) it\u2019s a problem lol. \n\nShe\u2019ll get over it. Just do your thing. And make sure to pay attention to her the other days. Work with her, don\u2019t just say I\u2019m not doing anything m,w,f.

You can\u2019t just not be her boyfriend for 3 days. She chose to move in with you because she wanted to share a life with you. Are you going to talk to her, watch tv, cook meals and eat together or just completely check out? Because I imagine that would feel isolating for her", "Your GF is lacking a big dose of empathy. She sounds very self centered.", "NTA - Now I'm single but I do this every Sunday. Laundry is the only \"work\" I do on that day, all of my other projects get put down for a day.  Its good to unplug the brain before starting a new work week.", "NTA. I think her concerns are a bit overblown. If you schedule something and it's unavoidable, you can just move one of your rest days. The key is that you get 2-3 days of them a month. That's not unreasonable. You're not going to be fully scheduled for 27 days of any given month.\n\nI don't think it's reasonable to say \"during my rest days I refuse to get anything at all done around the house, even small amounts of dishes or picking up\", but you never suggested or even implied that that would be the case.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed time to yourself, but your phrasing basically insinuates you refuse to be an active partner for days at a time every month. Can\u2019t really blame her for getting upset that you\u2019re planning on being unavailable that often. I think if you approached it more casually and just kind of did it rather than telling her you\u2019re planning that, she wouldn\u2019t be that upset. \n\nYou just didn\u2019t need to announce it the way you did, I think that\u2019s the main issue. She probably assumes the reason you\u2019re telling her is to warn her you just won\u2019t be around for her, which isn\u2019t fair to do to a long term partner.\n\nI think you should take into consideration that there were multiple people in this thread that heard what you said and thought \u201che doesn\u2019t want to be a partner for a few days every month.\u201d That\u2019s likely what she heard too, because quite frankly I don\u2019t understand why else you would communicate with her what you\u2019re intending. You could just do it. She clearly isn\u2019t the only one that got that from what you said.", "NAH - I completely understand what you are saying. But this can be a really hard thing to negotiate in a relationship - especially if she is recharged by getting out and doing things/being social and you are recharged by being home and relaxing. \n\nTry explaining (maybe again) that this isn't about not spending time with her, but about having time where you can relax without having to be \"on\" with other people. That when you are at home alone or with just her you can relax in a way that you can't do around other people. \n\nAsk her to be open minded about it for a few months and then the two of you can reassess. If she pushes back, point out that you have already tried NOT taking this time, and it isn't working for you.", "NTA\n\nI don't get why people think, relationship=a Venom type situation.\n\nYou're allowed to take a break from everyone, even your partner. If they have an issue with it, that means they need entertainment more than they need the person.", "I block out my calendar every Sunday to let every concerned party know that's my day to myself. I don't want to do anything for or with anyone on that day .\n\nI do a lot of volunteer work, and help my grown son, my nibling, and my sweetheart all the time.\n\nI just need one day a week to myself.  I might catch up on housework, laundry, spend time on my hobbies or in the garden.  I might just binge watch a show and eat snacks all day.  Whatever I want.\n\nThere are weeks when I do make plans on my day, then I just take the next day off.\n\nIt's been working out fairly well, I've been able to take at least half of the days I wanted.  My mental health is much better and everyone gets a better version of me.", "YTA, you are living with your gf. You can't realistically just tell her to just act for a whole weekend, every month, as if you don't exist. Plus, that put her in the \"stuff that drains you\" category, which is maybe true, but an AH thing to say to your gf.", "NAH, whenever I see these post I always think the same thing. You deserve a break from work and studying, but you don\u2019t just get a break from dating someone. You still should go on dates, plan something, do something special, cook something, or literally anything. Telling your partner that you don\u2019t want to plan anything or do anything involving them for up to 10% of the month is just never going to go well. You should do something special with her before you do your self care days.

I don't guilt trip her for going out to decompress, and she doesn't guilt trip me for needing some to myself to hike with the dog or read or whatever.", "NTA. Good god if you can't even have 2 or 3 days a month to recharge what in the hell is the point?  Your gf sounds like a giant ball of pointless drama. I'd consider finding a partner who can go ten minutes without you attached to their hip.", "NTA - Why does it sound like she\u2019s mad because she won\u2019t have you around to entertain her? Is she not an adult who is capable of having her own hobbies or doing her own things?", "NTA. i have no idea why people are even discussing this. a few days of vegging per month is extremely reasonable", "Rgrh", "I\u2019m going to weigh in from the perspective of when I was young and poor, my BF and I (now Hubby), had 1 tv, dial-up internet and a landline phone (no cells) which was tied to the internet. If he wanted to play online games (we\u2019re talking almost 20 years ago) then it took up all of those things and we lived in an extremely small apartment: if you are taking up all the the entertainment and/or space when you co-habituate then YTH, if she can reasonably entertain herself without either of you bothering the other then NTH. Now we have the luxury of having space and multiple ways of entertaining ourselves. \n\nAlso, food? Is she cooking? Are you? Ordering in? Are you only thinking of yourself when it comes to food? There are multiple ways of being selfish here. You both need to communicate and be good partners to each other. Mutual respect and communication saves a lot of relationships.", "NTA.  But if it were me I'd do it staycation style and stay at a hotel.  I don't understand why she can't schedule those days to hang out with friends or go do things you may not enjoy.", "INFO: How does your PTO work? Is it banked hours. If you took 2-3 days a month would you be running out of days to plan a vacation, if an emergency happens and you could not go to work would it be deducted from your PTO or do you have a seperste sick bank?", "NTA - only unhealthy thing here is your girlfriend\u2019s reaction.", "NTA Man, please. You take your time and she can accept that or buzz off.", "right like op is making a huge deal out of nothing. he is just describing prioritizing chilling at home on the weekends a few days a month but he chose to phrase it as \"for the foreseeable futures i'm doing my own activities several days a month and refuse to leave the house even if something comes up\" is suuuuuper weird and now he is having a problem. I see why he needs to plan his relax days, this man has zero sense of chill.", "Her boyfriend is going through a stressful time and all she can talk about is herself and how she's affected, seems kinda like asshole behavior to me.", "Its a relationship, not the military...", "NAH? No, she's definitely an AH for monopolizing her boyfriend's time and making him feel bad about it :|", "Your scenario wouldn't happen so I don't know why you just decided to make it up.", "Strong vein of co-dependency here. She could easily do all of these things by herself, and having separate plans/interests is generally a healthy thing to do in relationships.", "You tell em go getter! Get a third job op, if you haven't worked yourself to death by now you're a lazy bum!!! Reddit is hilarious", "Just to clarify, most of these days would be on a weekend as opposed to me using annual leave during the week for them", "So I have zero sense of chill because I communicated my plans to my girlfriend?", "disagree. I think from the gf's POV her bf just told her \"Hey for 2-3 days a month I don't want to hang out with you because i need to recharge even though we live together\" and if my fiance told me something like that i would be like what the fuck? Obvi people need their own space and time, and I'm sure the gf knows that. But the way op is just laying down the law with this blanket statement of \"for the foreseeable futures i'm doing my own activities several days a month and refuse to leave the house even if something comes up\" is suuuuuper weird. It's fine to have a self care day, those are great and so healthy, but to be this inflexible is very odd and i see why she is concerned.\n\nLike why couldn't he have just said \"I'm getting more burnt out at work, I think it would be a good idea to prioritize relaxation at home a few times a month. For me that looks like playing video games, watching movies, and ordering in.\" That would be normal. He is turning something healthy into something aggressive.", "I suppose you can always stress quality time over quantity. For example those days your doing your solo thing make the effort to have meals together at least.", "Makes no difference...same answer.  I'm sure she's a grown woman and should be able to function perfectly in society without you glued to her.  If not, you have bigger problems  :)", ">\"Hey for 2-3 days a month I don't want to hang out with you because i need to recharge even though we live together\n\nI'll be staying home  and not making plans.

She has no concept that people go home and don\u2019t constantly talk with others. When we got close she always asked why I didn\u2019t text her back and I just had to be real and tell her that I\u2019ve got other stuff going on, namely my evening hobbies, and I don\u2019t keep my phone on me. That\u2019s when I realized that she doesn\u2019t do anything outside her phone, and so she doesn\u2019t understand why other people don\u2019t respond.

I think that getting in the habit of doing everything together is a common habit for couples, but spending time apart is also good and healthy. \n\nPersonally, my partner is usually the one who would spend a day off napping and watching movies and whatever while I would rather go out. So for a while, we'd just do what he wanted to do all day and maybe go out a bit at night, but eventually I started going on walks in the afternoon and go places (museum, fancy bakery, pub with friends (the latter my partner would get invited to)) while he napped and we'd eat and maybe one or both of us would go out or maybe we'd stay in. It didn't happen every weekend that we'd do totally different things (sometimes I'd stay in or he would go out), but it was nice while it lasted (we have a toddler now so we can't do this as well). \n\nAnyway, maybe if OP reassures his gf that she's invited to stay in and do nothing too or points out some activity she's been more interested in than he has and suggest that maybe she could head out if she wants to do something while he chills at home, then she might come on board with this plan. Who knows, she might have been putting off some friend hang outs because she's in couple mode and this might encourage her to plan some? As long as she gets the day to chill in her way, it doesn't sound like this should be a problem.", "Lmao you soft af so fragile, how did you get hurt so easily", "How much quality time do you get together during the week? I think it\u2019s a completely valid ask by you, but I also understand her freaking worrying if that\u2019s taking out a pretty big chunk of the quality time you get together", "He was abusing her :( https://reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/s/ma41SDfVEd", "We have every evening together during the week then spend pretty much every day on weekends together", "Okay gotcha! It sounds like she needs to accept it and adjust then. Were you clear about how much you can interact? The phrasing about taking the day to yourself may have thrown her off- I know you clarified you\u2019re not kicking her out, but I would also be confused on like if I was supposed to leave you alone the whole day, if I could still be in the same room, etc. I feel like the logistics aren\u2019t exactly super obvious when you\u2019re living together in a relatively small space", "You didn't explain, yourself or anything. You made a judgement (that I 75% agree with) and then wrote a condescending \"reminder\" about an element that was pure supposition based on gender stereotypes and not supported by information in the post at all.\n\nMy post was not about your judgement in the AITA format. It was about you insinuating that \"time for myself\" meant skipping out on responsibilities when OP had clearly stated that their partner's issue was with OP taking time for himself, as opposed to time for them as a couple. Note the \"we\" in her reasoning, entirely committing the fact that he gets to decide on his 50% of the \"we\".\n\nIn my experience, people that accuse others of knee-jerk reactions and refuse to \"spoon-feed\", more often than not, have exhausted logic and insist on their authority instead.
