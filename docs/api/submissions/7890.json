I was torn because I\u2019ve worked with him for 3 years without any issues and it was the first disagreement we had. So thanks everyone who said I\u2019m not the AH and put my mind at ease.\n\nOnto the update. After our uncomfortable conversation, I went to a training programme in another state so I didn\u2019t see him until the next Monday. I drove to work as usual and he also came in (by Uber, I found out later). We didn\u2019t speak until lunch, when to my surprise, he apologized to me.\n\nHe said he was stressed about fixing his car (he had to replace the radiator and wait for the part) and having to spend more money on rides. He admitted that he has never taken the bus! He moved to this city 3 years ago for the job and never had to use public transport since he\u2019s always had a car. So he was feeling anxious and took it out on me, I guess. He said I didn\u2019t deserve it and I accepted his apology.\n\nSo he still Ubers to work since he doesn\u2019t want to get up early. But I offered to send him to the bus station near my place after work and he can take an Uber home from there (it\u2019s easier to get a ride at the station instead of from our work). He graciously accepted and offered to chip in for gas, but I said it\u2019s fine since we\u2019ll be going the same way. So he bought me lunch instead! I ended up sending him for 3 days then he got his car back.\n\nSome people might say I shouldn\u2019t offer to help him but it wasn\u2019t a bother for me and who knows if one day I might be his position. Our working relationship is stronger now and I\u2019m glad we could both move forward in a better place.\n\nThat\u2019s my update, have a great day.", "created_utc": 1674288729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hma7a/update_aita_for_refusing_to_pick_up_my_coworker/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Nice update, glad it all worked out!", "Always nice to see a wholesome ending.
