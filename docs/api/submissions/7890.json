I was torn because I\u2019ve worked with him for 3 years without any issues and it was the first disagreement we had. So thanks everyone who said I\u2019m not the AH and put my mind at ease.\n\nOnto the update. After our uncomfortable conversation, I went to a training programme in another state so I didn\u2019t see him until the next Monday. I drove to work as usual and he also came in (by Uber, I found out later). We didn\u2019t speak until lunch, when to my surprise, he apologized to me.\n\nHe said he was stressed about fixing his car (he had to replace the radiator and wait for the part) and having to spend more money on rides. He admitted that he has never taken the bus! He moved to this city 3 years ago for the job and never had to use public transport since he\u2019s always had a car. So he was feeling anxious and took it out on me, I guess. He said I didn\u2019t deserve it and I accepted his apology.\n\nSo he still Ubers to work since he doesn\u2019t want to get up early. But I offered to send him to the bus station near my place after work and he can take an Uber home from there (it\u2019s easier to get a ride at the station instead of from our work). He graciously accepted and offered to chip in for gas, but I said it\u2019s fine since we\u2019ll be going the same way. So he bought me lunch instead! I ended up sending him for 3 days then he got his car back.\n\nSome people might say I shouldn\u2019t offer to help him but it wasn\u2019t a bother for me and who knows if one day I might be his position. Our working relationship is stronger now and I\u2019m glad we could both move forward in a better place.\n\nThat\u2019s my update, have a great day.", "created_utc": 1674288729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hma7a/update_aita_for_refusing_to_pick_up_my_coworker/", "score": 1147, "replies": ["Nice update, glad it all worked out!", "Always nice to see a wholesome ending.

(But you know I won\u2019t.)", "Love your update. He saw and owned his mistake. You were gracious and even offered help that wasn't a problem for you. The grace just kept growing between you. Wonderful!", "Agree! And I would\u2019ve done the same thing as OP. If someone offers a genuine apology, I don\u2019t just write them off as being evil.\n\nPlus, as a public transit user, I get that it can be terrifying to anyone who hasn\u2019t ever used it, and learning how to public transit when super stressed is not a fun time. I\u2019m glad he was open to the bus station idea that OP suggested once things settled down!", "Thank you for the reference.\n\nAfter the updates it seems his coworker just didn\u2019t want to spend his money on rides to work, thought he couldn\u2019t guilt his friend into it, and got pissed when OP gave an alternate suggestion \n\n(^bus ^to ^OPs ^locale ^thus ^coworker ^needing ^to ^wake ^up ^early (his OG complaint and spending some money^). \n\nOP, you are far\nToo gracious than I am.", "Exactly this!

This was a great solution and it must be a relief not to be at odds with your colleague. \n\nThe bus anxiety is a real thing.  There was a post on Reddit a year or so ago about somebody being very anxious to ride the bus in their new city because they were worried about messing up the initial entry (buying the ticket, scanning, talking to the driver etc).  While some very kind Redditors gave them details advice on the procedures for that specific sigh, there was a general discussion about what to do in new cities.  Turns out, a lot of people very closely watch several people getting on various buses before doing it themselves. I, for one, am very thankful for the switch to electronic scanning in a lot of cities - one less thing about which to feel\nlike an idiot.", "This was a great update! Also a great reminder that sometimes we act like AHs not because we\u2019re bad people, but because we\u2019re just going through it and aren\u2019t handling it well. Glad he owned up to his shit, and glad you helped make something positive out of it!", "I'm autistic and have to eat crow a lot when I get overstimulated.

Glad to hear everything worked out well. You seem like a really upstanding person.", "Depending on the car he should absolutely learn to replace that radiator himself. It's general not a difficult removal and install if you follow directions, of which there are pretty much videos for every single car in existence on YouTube as long as he isn't driving a supercar. It will be about a thousand times cheaper than Uber. Ive replaced radiators in my apartment complex garage in 45 minutes since the HOA has banned doing car work in the garage", "I really get good vibes / feelings from nice updates.", "I'm sorry but what tf does eat crow mean what is happening to those poor birds", "Sounds like you kind of suck"]}
