I was torn because I\u2019ve worked with him for 3 years without any issues and it was the first disagreement we had. So thanks everyone who said I\u2019m not the AH and put my mind at ease.\n\nOnto the update. After our uncomfortable conversation, I went to a training programme in another state so I didn\u2019t see him until the next Monday. I drove to work as usual and he also came in (by Uber, I found out later). We didn\u2019t speak until lunch, when to my surprise, he apologized to me.\n\nHe said he was stressed about fixing his car (he had to replace the radiator and wait for the part) and having to spend more money on rides. He admitted that he has never taken the bus! He moved to this city 3 years ago for the job and never had to use public transport since he\u2019s always had a car. So he was feeling anxious and took it out on me, I guess. He said I didn\u2019t deserve it and I accepted his apology.\n\nSo he still Ubers to work since he doesn\u2019t want to get up early. But I offered to send him to the bus station near my place after work and he can take an Uber home from there (it\u2019s easier to get a ride at the station instead of from our work). He graciously accepted and offered to chip in for gas, but I said it\u2019s fine since we\u2019ll be going the same way. So he bought me lunch instead! I ended up sending him for 3 days then he got his car back.\n\nSome people might say I shouldn\u2019t offer to help him but it wasn\u2019t a bother for me and who knows if one day I might be his position. Our working relationship is stronger now and I\u2019m glad we could both move forward in a better place.\n\nThat\u2019s my update, have a great day.", "created_utc": 1674288729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hma7a/update_aita_for_refusing_to_pick_up_my_coworker/", "score": 3245, "replies": ["Nice update, glad it all worked out!", "Always nice to see a wholesome ending.

(But you know I won\u2019t.)", "Love your update. He saw and owned his mistake. You were gracious and even offered help that wasn't a problem for you. The grace just kept growing between you. Wonderful!", "Agree! And I would\u2019ve done the same thing as OP. If someone offers a genuine apology, I don\u2019t just write them off as being evil.\n\nPlus, as a public transit user, I get that it can be terrifying to anyone who hasn\u2019t ever used it, and learning how to public transit when super stressed is not a fun time. I\u2019m glad he was open to the bus station idea that OP suggested once things settled down!", "[deleted]", "Exactly this! Nice to see grown people acting mature, taking accountability and resolving issues.", ">Some people might say I shouldn\u2019t offer to help him but it wasn\u2019t a bother for me and who knows if one day I might be his position.

This was a great solution and it must be a relief not to be at odds with your colleague. \n\nThe bus anxiety is a real thing.  There was a post on Reddit a year or so ago about somebody being very anxious to ride the bus in their new city because they were worried about messing up the initial entry (buying the ticket, scanning, talking to the driver etc).  While some very kind Redditors gave them details advice on the procedures for that specific sigh, there was a general discussion about what to do in new cities.  Turns out, a lot of people very closely watch several people getting on various buses before doing it themselves. I, for one, am very thankful for the switch to electronic scanning in a lot of cities - one less thing about which to feel\nlike an idiot.", "This was a great update! Also a great reminder that sometimes we act like AHs not because we\u2019re bad people, but because we\u2019re just going through it and aren\u2019t handling it well. Glad he owned up to his shit, and glad you helped make something positive out of it!", "I'm autistic and have to eat crow a lot when I get overstimulated. It's embarrassing but necessary.", "Its nice when people act like human beings and work things out. Well done both of you! Definitely NAH!!", "Nice! :)", "Awe cute. I love when situations get resolved amicably", "Awesome update.", "Takes a lot of empathy to be able to project your best intentions onto somebody else's poor behavior, but it takes far more guile to do it safely with finesse.\n\nGg, 1CC.", "love a good redemption arc. big dubs to you both.", "Great. Glad to hear everything worked out well. You seem like a really upstanding person.", "Depending on the car he should absolutely learn to replace that radiator himself. It's general not a difficult removal and install if you follow directions, of which there are pretty much videos for every single car in existence on YouTube as long as he isn't driving a supercar. It will be about a thousand times cheaper than Uber. Ive replaced radiators in my apartment complex garage in 45 minutes since the HOA has banned doing car work in the garage", "I really get good vibes / feelings from nice updates.", "I'm sorry but what tf does eat crow mean what is happening to those poor birds", "Sounds like you kind of suck", "Definitely nta.  You help me have faith that people can work out problems and be nice.  Huge karma points for you!!", "IMO it\u2019s good to acknowledge genuine apologies. It\u2019s hard to do and a lot of people don\u2019t graciously accept them. A lot of people also don\u2019t grow up having that kind of vulnerability recognized or valued. You did a good thing and maintained your boundaries. Well done.", "Well done. You need to work with him. He is human. You took the kindness route", "You're a good person. Real life is not black & white like this sub likes to pretend it is. Good outcome here.", "great update!", "Champion results. Glad the two of you worked it out, largely due to him owning his behavior, and then you actively offering to help as you could.", "Love this update \ud83d\udc4f", "Good on you for accepting his apology and remaining a good friend", "Brilliant thinking coming up with a solution that has strengthened your work friendship, great way to keep the place toxic free \ud83d\ude0a", "Nice update.", "Well, then you kind of suck imo. Coworker apologized. And people make mistakes, I'm sure you made some mistakes as well and aren't a Saint either. And especially during stressful times people are prone to mistakes. And sure, some mistakes can't be forgiven. But this is really not that big of a situation.\n\nOP now again has a good professional relationship with co worker. Your suggestion to be less gracious can only result in a more strenuous working situation and who wants that?", "An a phrase it means the same thing as to eat your words.  The origin is a little murky but mostly revolves around crows not being appetizing (and I guess the Christian bible says don't eat them?) and having to suffer through eating a crow (with or without scotch bonnet peppers) as a result of making a bold claim.", "This is lovely. Everyone can be an asshole when frustrated, and we are all guilty of taking our frustrations out on people who don't deserve it. I love that he owned it and apologised.", "Love this. Being alive is complicated and your compassion speaks volumes. We all have our bad moments, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re bad people. \u2665\ufe0f", "Great update", "Nice update", "That's an awesome update! I see nothing wrong with helping him, since he apologized to you and evem offered to chip in for gas.", "I'm so pleased that it worked out! Glad your co-worker apologized", "Yeah, I would definitely want a buddy to show me the first time on a city's public transportation. I grew up in the country and distant suburbs and it just isn't a thing. Train/bus schedules might as well be written in Chinese for all I understand them.", "I will hold a grudge for eternity, but if you apologize and mean it, it's like whatever it was never happened.", "This reminded me of my first time using Public Transportation.  \n\nMy 10yo son and 17yo daughter met up with my siblings and their kids in Chicago for a 3 day weekend.  The town where I was from (in TX) didn't have Public transportation.  \n\nDaughter wanted to go to the Art Museum because there was a display of Ansel Adams photos.  We were going to meet up with everyone at Shedds Aquarium at a certain time. \n\nWe get to the museum with no problems from our hotel room. I ask a person at the Museum which bus to take to to the Aquarium.  They told me to get in the Blue Line (or whatever it was). \n\nWe hop on the bus.  However,  about an hour later, we were told to get off the bus.  (I can't remember why.  End of the line? Or on too long?) We got off in a suburban neighborhood.  I have no idea where we were.  I am unsure whether to just wait for the next bus. Or try and find a store. Or knock on someone's door and ask Where am I, and how do I get back to the City.  (This was before cell phones). I was starting to panic a bit.  \n\nThen I see a Taxi coming down the street.  I had never been in a taxi. What i knew about hailing a taxi I've seen in TV shows or movies. I go to the curb and stuck my arm out. To my surprise,  the taxi stopped. Took us to the Aquarium.  Found out,  I should have crossed the street first,  then got on the Blue Line bus, which wound have taken me right to the Aquarium.\n\nThat was an experience.  LoL", "I understand 100%!! I grew up in a rural town too, no public transit, just easier to own a beat up car to get around. Once I moved to the city I fell in love with public transit, just figuring out the routes, and then once the confidence kicks in I can relax and listen to music, play on my phone, stare out the window. I\u2019m probably weird, but I hate driving more than taking the bus haha.", "Yeah, I agree with you! From what I can tell maybe he was stressed about car repair costs and was trying to save money by having OP bend over backwards to cater to him, but once he got some perspective, he realized he was being unreasonable and apologized. Having to take the bus when he\u2019s never had to before could also be stressful, especially since during the pandemic so many public transit options have been gutted and remain short staffed.\n\nCould coworker have handled it better? Definitely. But he also made an effort to fix it after (uber and offering to pay for gas, buying OP lunch).", "I learned how to do that rather young, when your brain is constantly firing off and you think you know so much information but people are constantly correcting you. So i started just double checking things in my head lol and half the time im like oh, im glad i didnt say anything cuz after I know I would have been wrong once I thought about it", "I am glad that he apologized and that you were still willing to help him even after all the drama. You're a good friend.\n\nUnrelatedly: it's 2023 and it's never been easier to take a bus somewhere, so it amazes me when some people regard it as an arcane ritual. I know it's not a life skill that everyone picks up, but the schedules and routes are available online, and in lots of cities you can get an app that will _tell you where the bus is_ and how soon it will be coming.\n\nWhen I was in kindergarten, our teacher took the whole class to the post office and gave us each 22\u00a2 so we could buy a stamp and mail a letter home. Just to teach us how mail worked. I wish kids got taught about public transit the same way.", "Glad all's well that ends well. You acted well in response to his apology and showed there were no hard feelings. Good on you both", "Any time issues can be solved calmly and both parties are happy with the outcome it is no one else\u2019s business if they don\u2019t agree.", "Great update! Again NTA.", "That's really nice to hear. Good for you both!", "Good to hear. It never feels good when you're at odds with someone you work with. Well done.", "This is a very sweet ending. Love to see updates like this", "I'm glad that things worked out much better than expected! Great to hear that he realized that he was being a jerk and was 100% willing to try new things and that even though he was a jerk you still wanted to help. Good on you both.", "Great update. Way to be a good person.", "So do I! They feel so rare sometimes. :)", "I know you aren't OP, but\u2026 YTA.", "Thank you for an update showing that you are mature and kind!", "What do you mean \"kind of\"?", "Some people might say that, yes, but you did the right thing. There was no damage done to you, and he sincerely apologised. This is what apologizing is for; nobody is infallible. Refusing to help him even when it no longer costs you anything, would just mean you are holding on to what happened, and you say nothing happened before (would be a different scenario if it was a recurrent thing). And yes, you may find yourself in the same position, be it the car position, or the being rude because you were stressed position. Working things out is the adult thing to do.", "Such a good update. I work from home with coworkers across the country (none in my own city), so I wouldn't ever find myself in this predicament, but I'd like to think if I went back to working in a physical office and my car broke down, that I'd have a coworker like you who would be gracious enough look past my anxious outbursts. You're a very giving person, OP. <3", "I grew up in a small town, and it can be pretty nerve-wracking to figure out bus and subway routes in big cities. I don't know the neighborhoods, the landmarks are unfamiliar, the maps are tiny and not to scale--it just seems like a disaster waiting to happen. It is a big relief when I have a travel companion or a local friend to tag along with the first time to take the edge off. One friend specifically took me to the bus station when I arrived and walked me through getting the reloadable card (providing an estimate of how much I likely needed for the week) and made sure I knew which bus lines went back to his neighborhood if I ever got lost. It was so much less anxiety-inducing.\n\nThat said, I was on a trip with friends and figured out the NYC subway system with zero assistance (that time) and got us exactly where we needed to go over the course of 3 days, and it remains a personal triumph given some of the trouble I've had in other places.", "I'm not autistic and I'm the same way. I always say and do things I don't mean in the heat of the moment."]}
