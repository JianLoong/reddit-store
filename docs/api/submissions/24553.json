The day after you get married, nobody cares that you were the bride. They care about how you treated them during your wedding planning and wedding day.

If you are a step-parent, especially to a child that has lost a parent, then you need to go slow and let the child set the speed of your relationship. The ex-stepmom pushed and pushed and wouldn't take no for an answer, even after they were divorced. And now this: yet more emotional blackmail, trying to force OP to play happy families.\n\nIf she isn't over this situation and ready to accept that OP doesn't think of her as a parent - TWENTY YEARS after the event - then she needs serious therapy. Because that's effing delusional.\n\n(Also, she wasn't some na\u00efve child when she married OP's dad. She was a grown woman in her thirties who must have known that her husband didn't actually want to remarry but was doing it under pressure from his family.)", "It\u2019s your wedding not hers. She needs to stop forcing her mother into your life.", "She wasn't forced into the marriage and i'm guessing she was okay with the groom marrying reluctantly. Yet, she still tried to force OP, who was a 10yo child who just lost her mother, to play happy family with her and had a kid with a man who didn't love her. So this is on her too, no one forced her to stay married for years (or even to get married in the first place). Why would op care one way or the other? This woman has done nothing but force herself into her life, not respecting her, since day 1.", "NTA,But I must say that your dad is very shitty of a person to do that to his ex. His ex need to let this go and find her peace.", "NTA the half sister is in this situation BUT your dad is 100% the biggest asshole here. He decided to impregnate a woman he didn\u2019t love, making it harder for her to leave. Then to make it worse he continuously verbally abused her in front of you and your half sister. To be real here, fuck that dude\u2026", "Be kind, but stand your ground.  Let your half sister know that you'll be disappointed if she chooses not to attend your wedding but that she's an adult and you'll respect her choice.  If she asks again remind her that's already been decided and don't further engage.", "NAH except your dad", "NTA. I'm so over people trying force a bride/groom into inviting <insert person inappropriate to attend>.", "NTA", "NTA. They\u2019ve been divorced longer than she was in your life. So weird she is still obsessed with you. \nAlso, your wedding means your rules. So tacky sending your sister to beg for an invite. Like why would you want to be at an event you KNOW you\u2019re not wanted at?! Embarrassing \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding, your decision.\n\nIf your sister can't respect your decision, then she shouldn't come.", "NTA you barely had a relationship, you don't want her there. I don't see why you would \"benefit\" by former stepmother being there, as your half sister says.", "NTA, it's your wedding & only you & your fiance get to decide who is invited. If your half sister keeps pushing, tell her she no longer has a choice - she is uninvited. And have some kind of bouncer or security at the door to block them in case they show up!", "NTA. I can understand why, if she saw you as her daughter, she would feel bad about not being invited - but personally if that was me, I would feel WORSE if I received an invite and it was only because you were guilted into it. If this is a guilt trap like people have suggested to get you to invite her to the wedding - she either doesn\u2019t ACTUALLY view you as her daughter, or she\u2019s a really shitty mom.", "What do people do without event invitation rules?? The host of the show sets the rules and that's it, you're the guest.", "Exactly, plus, she has her own daughter! Right there, in front of her!", "This lady hasn\u2019t been in OP\u2019s life in like 20 years. Surely you don\u2019t expect OP to invite *everyone* she\u2019s ever had in her life who didn\u2019t mistreat her? Also, it\u2019s a small wedding. Friends and family. This lady is neither.", "Dad's mistake is not OP's fault. And OP has her own reasons for not liking her. Honestly, your comment makes you an awful person.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Me too.", ">threw insults around that I would rather her not be there than invite her mom.\n\nOh good. She can comprehend the spoken word just fine. NTA", "Wow. YTA. That poor woman didn't deserve you two garbage humans. You should marry your father.", "NAH but your dad is", "NTA.\n\nYou know what you want, half-sis is pushing (guessing your dad's ex is pushing it, too), and you don't have to put up with them.\n\nThey AREN'T family, especially if your own father doesn't stay in touch with them.", "Nta it your wedding day your guest list end of story", "NTA. And why would this woman even *want* to be at a wedding, knowing that the bride doesn't want her there? It's really odd.", "You laid out the rules and understood she might not be able to attend.   She can't attend...  NTAH.", "NTA\n\nYour father should never have been pushed to move on before he was ready, even if he never was, it just shouldn't have been done, and in my opinion the true monsters here are your aunt and grandparents for pushing this unhealthy situation into being.\n\nThat said, you've been clear about your stance with your fathers ex, you didn't see her as a mother and had no deserve to enable such an attachment. Your Half-sister was likewise being egregiously manipulative, and she needed to be shut down lest you enable this bizarre belief she can make you and your ex-step-mother suddenly have a bond.", "NTA", "NTA  \nYour half-sister does NOT get to dictate your guestlist.  \nShe can do that at her own wedding.", "NTA\n\nThough this wasn't the situation that I thought it would be. I thought that your dad's ex had cheated on him or been an abuser, so he didn't want her at the wedding.\n\nInstead it was your dad who was the (emotional) abuser and you picked up his dismissive attitude about your former step-mother from him.\n\nWhy she would want anything to do with you given the contempt with which you treated her is beyond me. I guess she's a kinder person than me.\n\nSounds like you could have had another loving person in your life, but you threw it away. Since it's already in the trash, best you keep it there and don't have her come.", ">And ignore the Y. T. A. responses that are saying that your ex stepmom has been perfectly nice to you so therefore she \"deserves\" to have a closer relationship with you/be invited to your wedding. You never owe someone a relationship, regardless of how kind they are to you.\n\nYeah, these threads get a passel of, \"he/she was there longer than your bio-parent and put effort into buying your love, so you owe them appreciation\" types every time a thread concerns step-parents. They then say, \"everyone in this thread is in their teens so they don't understand!\"", "It's the 2 decades for me. How can the ex-stepmom still insist on some type of bond after all those refusals on OP's part...", "NTA - I don't understand why people think that stressful events like a wedding are a great situation to try and force people to pick up fractured relationships.\n\nIf your sister wants you to have more of a relationship with her and her mother, she should invite you to a lunch, or something like that.  You may, of course, decline.", "Me too and NTA OP. Glad your dad always had your back and didn't pressure you to replace your mom with your stepmother. His family  that pressured him into moving on are definately YTA."]}
