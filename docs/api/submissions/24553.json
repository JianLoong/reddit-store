The day after you get married, nobody cares that you were the bride. They care about how you treated them during your wedding planning and wedding day.

It seems clear she still cares about your well-being and has no ill intent towards you. It's not possible to know all the ins and outs of your family dynamics, but if coming to your wedding would mean a lot to her and your sister, is it really that big of a deal? Unless you expect her to make a scene, I would encourage you to think about it some more just to see if it's a nice gesture you could be ok with. You absolutely don't have to and inviting her doesn't suddenly change your relationship with her, but she's one of the adults who did her best to contribute to making you the person you are now and she's also your sister's parent.

You're not obligated to invite anyone to YOUR wedding that you don't want to be a part of it. Whether they are blood relatives or not, you have who YOU want at your wedding. \n\nI have a feeling, based on your edit, that your half sisters mum wants to play the 'mother of the bride' role. Your half sister also probably hears how much her mum cared and loved you and wanted to continue being your 'mum' and felt that because your mum had died and was no longer in your life, she wanted to take that role. And even though she knew your dad didn't love her, she wanted to keep the role of playing your 'mum'. Whether it's coz she thought it made her look good 'taking on a child whose lost her mum, and continuing to even after divorce' or whether it's coz she genuinely cared and loved you we don't know. Either option is possible. But after not having spent any time with you or visitation for several years as you were growing up and into adulthood, you'd think she'd have given up on playing the 'mum' role to you. \n\nBut it seems your half sister is being pressured by her mum to try and rekindle the relationship, and trying to get her to convince you to include you at your wedding. \n\nI can almost guarantee she will try and play the mother of the bride role. \n\nAlthough what you said to your half sister was perfectly fine, and you just let her know that if she didn't want to come to the wedding without her mum you'd understand, and not hold it against her, she's obviously taken that to be you don't care about her enough to want her at your wedding. \n\nIf you want to smooth things over with her, I'd suggest talking to her and saying that you're sorry for her feeling like you don't want her at your wedding, that you obviously would live for her to be a part of your special day. But that unfortunately you don't want her mother there, and when you said 'you dont have to come to the wedding if you can't come without your mum, I'll understand' that you didn't mean her to take it that you don't want her there, it's just you don't want her mum there, and as she was saying she couldn't leave her mum behind, you didn't want her to feel guilty if she felt she couldn't go and leave her mum. That you would love for her to attend, but unfortunately you don't want her mum to attend, but she needs to decide whether she wants to come by herself, or if she'd rather stay with her mum, and that you'll understand either way. But she needs to respect the fact that you don't want a relationship with her mum. You don't see her as your mum, and she never will be. It's nothing against her as a person, and she may well be a lovely mother to her, but she's not your mum, and you don't want that type of relationship with her, and it's not fair to try and push that on you. Plus it has been many years now since she was married to your Dad. If she's willing to come alone, you'd love her to be there, but if she chooses not to, you understand. But she needs to respect your wishes of not trying to push a relationship between you and her mum from now on. \n\nHopefully that discussion may help smooth things over with her so she knows you do want her at your wedding, and you do care about her (assuming that's the case lol) and you've also made it clear about her not trying to push a relationship with her mum going forward, but its been said in a respectful way, so youre not bad mouthing her mum, its just you dont see her as your step mum or a mum figure and dont want that relationship with her. Otherwise this will continue to happen, esp if you have children etc she'll be wanting to see the 'grandkids' so to speak. \n\nEither way, it's your wedding and you should have only the people who you want there. The people you love and care about and have a good relationship with that you want there. It's your day, not her mothers.", "Looks like your dad was the AH in your childhood and not your former stepmother. \n\nYou don't have to invite her if you don't want to, and your half sister is out of line for trying to emotionally manipulate you into doing it, so you're NTA.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm really not sure *why* this is so important to you. Not that it's my business.", "I was thinking that the former stepmom wants to be there because \"her daughter's\" getting married.", "In fairness, this thread is full of children.", "Eh, dad is also kind of the asshole for treating his ex like crap while they were together. He's a major reason the two of them never bonded, I'll bet. OP is NTA here.", "Are you the AH? Yes and No\n\nNo, because you have every right to select who is to come to your wedding.\n\nYes, because of the way you have treated your ex-stepmother for nearly all of your life.\n\nYour dad married her in bad faith. Sure, he was pressured by his parents, and married before he was ready. But his giving in to the pressure, instead of standing up to his parents, is no excuse.\n\nHe then married your ex-stepmother, and proceeded to ignore her, ignore her standing in the relationship, didn\u2019t even attempt to love her, BUT STILL CHOSE to have another child with her.\n\nYour ex-stepmother entered the marriage in good faith. She became your stepmother in good faith. You came into her life when she met your father, and there is nothing to say she didn\u2019t care for you or love you, nor any evidence that she was trying to replace your mother. But, as a child, you took you father\u2019s example and were as cold and distant as he was.\n\nWhen your ex-stepmother finally realised that there was no saving her marriage, that she would always be a second-rate, inferior member in her matrimonial life, she left. \n\nAnd what did your father do? He withheld you!\n\nWhat did you do? You didn\u2019t oppose it!\n\nNow, surely as an adult, you can clearly see that your father was an abuser, that perhaps your ex-stepmother understandably wants to foster a relationship with the child she had come to allow in her life all those years ago, despite the child\u2019s coldness, and came to love, even after she got rid of the foul, distant, cold man in her life, she didn\u2019t deserve.\n\nAs a free-thinking adult, you have no excuse to still take the cue from your father\u2019s actions and remain cold hearted.", "Based on the timeline, your dad married his ex when you were 7.5, and then divorced her when you were 10.5 years old.

Honestly it is Opie's day and if she wants to say no thank you I do not want you at my wedding then it is her choice. I blame the father's family for they forced a man that did not want to move on or say goodbye to the love of his life into marrying a woman that he was not emotionally available. And it is just like how kids will perceive the emotions of their parents and Opie realized that that stepmother or except mother is not her mother just another human being that came into our life and left. So whoever spelled it was I blame the family but the father yeah he is bit of an a-hole but still I would not blame Opie it is her choice", "He didn't withhold me. That woman is not my mom. She was never going to replace my mom. I never asked for a new mom and I never wanted one.

But as the person who loved my father, as the person who is sis\u2019 mother, as the person who cares and loves me, I can respect you and have a relationship with you on those terms.\u201d?\n\nI honestly think that your ex-stepmother wasn\u2019t the only victim of your father\u2019s abuse."]}
