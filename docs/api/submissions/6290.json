If there is some kind of time sensitive event like a medical appointment or dinner with friends does your partner have to do something to get you there on time? I\u2019m sure you make compromises for your partner on other issues, but what is the balance like in this relationship?

To me, this post really isn\u2019t about whether it\u2019s realistic to live without a clock or not.

Diagnosing mental disorders and illnesses hinges on whether or not the symptoms of that disorder is negatively impacting your life, and yours absolutely is.
