If I'm doing chores or an activity not involving clock equipped electronics, it is nice to just have to take a look at a clock to know how much time has passed, especially if I have other plans for later. Many mornings, right after using the restroom, my first impulse is to reach out for an actual clock. \n\nPlus, as someone else said, phones are a distraction and one may want to check time without relying on their phones. Oftentimes I encourage myself while doing chores, like \"ok I am doing [something I don't like] for 30 minutes and then I can take a break.\" Believe me, if I had to check my phone to see how much time I had left, I would stop right there.", "You need to seek professional help. Period. You have no right to demand that your neuroses control your partners life as well as yours.", "You can say that this isn\u2019t about your mental illness all you want, but you are forcing something out of the norm onto your partner, without discussion because of YOUR issues - the root issue here is your mental illness. \n\nDid it ever occur to you that people like to avoid their phones/computers so as to not get sucked into screen time? Phones are big time wasters and can be stressful for folks - I know that I avoid my phone at home a lot for this reason, to increase my productivity. If I didn\u2019t have my kitchen clock, I\u2019d be lost. Why do people need to accommodate your needs and you don\u2019t need to accommodate or consider theirs?\n\nThis sounds like you need to seek out a psychiatrist and psychologist. In my limited knowledge, I\u2019m willing to bet this isn\u2019t actually about clocks and has a root issue that a mental health professional can assess and identify.", "Except it\u2019s not just YOUR home, you share it with a partner who wants/needs a clock to function in HER day to day. Given your edit basically saying you don\u2019t want to seek proper help and instead use a system that works for you but greatly inconveniences your partner. YTA. You\u2019re being very selfish using words like *safe* when you\u2019re creating an unsafe environment for your partner by being unwilling to compromise and attempting to manipulate her into agreeing by acting like her having a clock is dangerous for you.", "I dont understand. You stand there like, hypnotized by the clock or what?", "I am really curious what this means ... what do you mean by \"sucked into a spiral\"??? \n\nAre you stressed out by time? Even if you don't have any real deadlines or meetings? \n\nRegardless of your AITA, I know you said you already had help and this is your best coping mechanism, .... BUT, if you have this much trouble living in the regular world, you need to keep looking for help until something works. \n\nThis doesn't sound like a good, viable solution. Imagine someone telling an alcoholic, just don't go outside if alcohol triggers you because it's everywhere. You need to find a healthy balance that you can make basic chores and errands without being at your limit. \n\nHaving your work room be a safe space, or also the bedroom is one thing and reasonable. It's not reasonable to lord over the house and your partners' wishes.", "then that is somwthing you need to see a therapist for, not force onto your partner. the issue here is that you aren't seeking help and instead are choosing to make your partner adapt to your lifestyle, which is an unreasonable one at that. you have to realize that at this point it's either seek help and stay with your partner or choose your hourglasses and daylight cycles over them.", "It is! I mean atleast for me it is. The clock in my bedroom broke last week and the new one doesn't arrive until Wednesday. I was completely reliant on that clock for the time, Because When I work or am focused on a task, I usually keep my phone away to avoid distractions, unlocking your phone everytime you need to see the time, or using your phone early in the morning/late at night when you aren't fully awake yet and don't want to lose your sleep is a pain.\n\nOP needs a way to manage her issues without taking away her partners rights. It might seem small to us, but imagine dealing with it all the time. It's their house also.", "As opposed to being obligated to take your phone or computer literally everywhere in the house? What if it\u2019s charging? Some people really don\u2019t like to rely that much on technology.\n\nTo me, what is a bigger deal than wanting clocks down is the fact that OP refuses to get actual help for this issue that is literally affecting their household function and the people around them.  Their partner shouldn\u2019t HAVE to \u201cjustify\u201d wanting clocks around - it is very normal to have clocks around. They\u2019re on microwaves, ovens, walls, etc. It\u2019s their home too.\n\nThey went on for *paragraphs* making excuses for not getting professional help, talking about how *lucky* they are to have learned to cope. Demanding that your partners make changes and sacrifices for you is not how you \u201ccope\u201d with something like that.\n\n> I  can't see how this is such a big problem as she will still have her phone and her computer and the difference it is going to make to my life not being tempted to look at the time is hopefully going to be huge. \n\nThey \u201ccan\u2019t see\u201d it even though their partner had straight up told them it\u2019s a big deal to them. \n\n\n> Am I wrong here and is what I'm asking a far bigger deal than I expected? She's not taken her clock down yet and says that I'm an asshole for needing her to.\n\nIt\u2019s a far bigger deal to their partner, who lives there too. So yes, it\u2019s as big a deal as your partner is making it. Coming here and asking strangers whether their partner had a right not to want to take all their clocks down when they have already expressed that it is a big deal for them is invalidating their partner\u2019s voice in their own home.\n\n> A lot of people are saying that I should go and seek professional help. \n\nA lot of people are correct.\n\n> I have dealt with this issue for a long time in my life and have spoken to people who have helped with my anxiety but not with this issue. \n\nYour anxiety around this issue is the issue. They can teach you methods of coping with this issue that don\u2019t involve avoiding ever confronting this issue.\n\n> It's very difficult to access specialist support here \n\nI can understand that, but that\u2019s not a reason to just not seek specialist support. It\u2019s difficult but it\u2019s not prohibitive. If it is presenting an issue with your partner, keep trying. With everything virtual these days, there are options.\n\n> and I have had to come up with my own systems with hourglasses, planning around sunrise etc. \n\nWell you live with someone else now. And they have their own system. \n\n> And I know that this is unorthodox and I am very lucky to be able to cope this way \n\nThis doesn\u2019t sound like coping. It sounds like avoiding.  If someone is agoraphobic, avoiding ever going outside is not \u201ccoping.\u201d \n\n> but it helps me a lot and has changed my life. \n\nHow is this possible when there are clocks everywhere? Do you not ever have appointments with specific times?\n\n> This is why I want to expand and make my home a safer place.\n\nIf your home isn\u2019t already like this, how had this system \u201cchanged your life?\u201d\n\n> I appreciate people trying to help but gently want to remind people that my post isn't about whether I can seek support and it's about whether I have underestimated the importance of clocks to people and if I am being unreasonable to want to have visible time in my home tracked by only sand and daylight hours\n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide that. This is AITA. Not \u201chave I underestimated\u2026\u201d. You presented a situation. Using the information given, people decide whether or not you have been an asshole in this interpersonal conflict.\n\nAlso, this is contradictory and doesn\u2019t make sense. Your partner is telling you they absolutely do not want to adapt their home the way you are asking. \n\nYou are framing the reason you want to override their needs in their own home with the fact that you have these anxieties. \n\nSo, why would you think it is okay for your partner to be making sacrifices and significant changes for you (whether or not you think they\u2019re valid is irrelevant - they\u2019re valid to your partner, and it\u2019s incredibly belittling of you to ask strangers on the internet to validate them) if you aren\u2019t willing to continue making sacrifices and changes (ie continuing to seek out specialist help) for them?", "I am inclined to say that it is not necessary to have them up everywhere, but it becomes an issue when there is a blanket ban on them.", "So your new way of \u201cdealing\u201d with this is to further succumb to your time issue?

Growing up, there was an unwritten rule that my father believed there should be a clock within the peripheral vision no matter where you were in the house. Our bathroom had 3. Most were very decorative and looked ordinary. But when I moved out, I found myself missing the clocks. I have more than average, but only one in the bathroom.", "I mean, that\u2019s fair. It seems like there are so many ways they could compromise on this if there was some understanding of why she needs/wants to clock. Like they make bedside clocks that don\u2019t show the time unless you tap them, so maybe that would work.", "If I relied solely on my phone for the time I'd never get anything done! A phone is a distraction that I avoid looking at unless I'm having a down time period. I don't want to be slaves to a phone.\nIf I want to know the time I want to be able to just glance at my wrist. Also the idea of only having one time reference point sounds awful - how would you know it was right??", "Ah I missed this detail.

The most immediately obvious one is him getting some actual treatment for OCD.", "> Or a watch? \n\nThat\u2019s still a visible clock that OP would be tempted to look at, which would affect their ability to be around each other (if not, if the argument is that OP could just choose not to look at or fixate on it, then they should be doing that with the REST of the clocks in the house).\n\n> I don't think it would be a big deal for many people to get rid of clocks. \n\nIt\u2019s a big deal for their partner.
