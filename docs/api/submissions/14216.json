I like her a lot for the most part, but this instance has caused issues.\n\nRose gets hot easily and prefers to have the windows down. It doesn\u2019t matter what vehicle, what kind of weather temperature wise she needs them down. In her own, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal because she\u2019s driving. \n\nI don\u2019t mind the windows being down if we\u2019re driving through town. However, I cannot drive with windows down on the highway. I have ADHD and so driving in itself is a bit of a challenge. I\u2019ve learned how to deal with minor distractions but one I cannot get over is the sound of the windows down on the highway. \n\nI\u2019ve explained this to Rose and offered to even turn on the AC if she\u2019s truly that hot. She says she needs the windows down or else she\u2019s going to overheat. I\u2019ve told her to either wear layers in the car or again, I\u2019ll put on the AC. She\u2019s continued to do so, even after several talks with both her and Alex. My brother just kind of shrugs and says \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d Both have said there is no condition behind this preference.\n\nAs I said, Rose is a fun person, so the three of us and my girlfriend, \u201cPaige\u201d (30F) will go out often. At first, we took turns driving if we weren\u2019t Ubering somewhere but given this whole window debacle, I had stopped offering. Then Murphy\u2019s law went into place. The only available car was mine last night.\n\nWe picked up Alex and Rose, who sat in the backseat. As usual, Rose turned down the window. I told her I would be rolling it up when we got on the highway and she said that was fine and even did it herself when we pulled on. 2 minutes later, I hear the window coming down and that awful whooshing sound. I told her to put it back up and she started whining \u201cBut I\u2019m hot!\u201d I pointed out that the AC was on and that wasn\u2019t enough for her. She still refused. We came on a bit of traffic. I don\u2019t know if all cars have this, but mine has one where you can prevent the backseat from opening and closing the window. I assume it\u2019s a feature mostly for people with kids.\n\nI rolled up the window and used the feature. I don\u2019t think Rose realized I had done it, as it\u2019s a silent manuver, she just knew I rolled up the window. A little later, she tries to put it down again and it obviously doesn\u2019t work. She\u2019s getting frustrated. I tell her that it\u2019s not going to roll down and I won\u2019t unlock it until we get off the highway. She starts freaking out, telling me she\u2019s so hot and I need to open the window NOW! I tell her no and crank up the AC some more if she\u2019s that hot. Alex kept telling her to calm down, she\u2019s fine, etc. Rose whined the entire way, even when we got off the highway and I unlocked the windows. She didn\u2019t even touch them.\n\nWhen we got to our destination, Rose took an Uber home in a huff. She texted me later saying I\u2019m an asshole and if I expect her to get over being hot in the car, why can\u2019t I get over the distraction of the highway.

I would tell them you are never driving with her as a passenger again. Your safety supercedes her comfort. Your medical issues supercede her preferences.", "NTA at all, she sounds like\u2026 a lot to deal with. You offered perfectly good compromises and as the driver, what you say goes. Period. If she wants the windows down on the highway, she can drive!\n\nPlus AC is way better at cooling a person than a rolled down window\u2026", "NTA\n\nIt's your car. That's really it.\n\nRose , at 24, should have already learned that the world will not always bend to her whim.  If she knows she gets hot in cars, she should get herself a couple of pretty fans or even one of those rechargeable cooling gizmos.", "NTA. I personally have really bad ears and I can\u2019t drive at all with the windows down unless I\u2019m going 10 miles or less. Your maneuvering a multi ton metal death machine, so your concentration takes precedence over her being hot. Also, the AC should be enough.", "NTA. If rose needs that much cooling she should be seeing a doctor. If you genuinely need to cut out distractions while driving, then that takes priority and rose needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nTruly, I would live in front of an air conditioning vent if I could. I keep my bedroom window open in the winter. I HATE to be hot. But Rose is absurd. Does she have some kind of medical condition? Is she like this in other places or just in the car? Is it possible it's car sickness? Either way, WTF.", "NTA. Her being hot in the car is uncomfortable at worst. You being distracted while driving on the highway can end up with all four of you being a bloody smear. Of course the needs of the driver outweigh the needs of the passenger in this situation.", "NTA. You need to concentrate, and that's a distraction.   Can she sit in the front seat so the AC vents hit her directly?", "NTA. As the driver, whatever you say goes. She can go buy a handheld fan or even one of those mini battery powered ones if she\u2019s so fussy.", " Nta. She can deal with being uncomfortable for a little bit.  At least your car has ac. My friends previous car would overheat if we ran the ac constantly.", "NTA- since you\u2019re the one driving your needs come first you need to be confortable", "NTA.\n\nI hate the AC and need the window down, but not my car, not my decision. Unless it was a 5 hours drive, she can deal with the window closed.", "NTA. The driver's comfort comes first, because you are responsible for the lives and safety of your passenger. If you are distracted or uncomfortable, you can't reasonably provide that.", "NTA. As the driver, your comfort trumps hers.", "NTA at all. she doesn\u2019t have a condition making her overheat\u2026 but you DO have ADHD, a condition that makes it difficult to overcome distractions. it\u2019s already ridiculous bc you\u2019re the one driving and it\u2019s objectively annoying to have the windows down on the highway, but her thinking it\u2019d be just as easy for you to get over it as her makes no sense.", "NTA. Rose does not sound like a \u201cfun\u201d person at all. \n\nIf this incident caused her so much distress, she should see a doctor.", "I also get extremely overheated, especially when I have to rush or feel rushed, or if I\u2019ve just gotten out of the shower or something. Like, genuinely sweating buckets overheating. But I\u2019d still never tell someone I have to have the window down if they said it was distracting. She just needs to drive herself. NTA.", "NTA  from a person who always has the window down while I'm driving.  If you're the passenger in someone else's car, you go by their rules for driving. I understand getting too hot, but it isnt like you told her she can't have windows down at all, just not on the highway.", "\" I expect her to get over being hot in the car, why can\u2019t I get over the distraction of the highway. \"  \n\n\nAnd here's the difference between being the driver, and the passenger.  If the passenger is distracted by their discomfort, well, the passenger is distracted by their discomfort.  If the DRIVER is distracted by their discomfort, then oh shit look out for that truck augh augh we're all going to die.  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA you are the driver and you said the noise bothers you and offered solutions if she doesn't like those solutions she can just drive herself. \n\nI absolutely cannot stand the windows down even off highway, it's an auditory sensitivity I've always had, and the sound is physically painful. I fully understand your pain.", "I turn down my radio volume all the way and open all windows (during daytime) when im reversing bc im paranoid of accidentally not hearing someone behind me and hitting them. Doesn't matter the weather. So if I have a passenger, sorry, but you're gonna have to deal with those few seconds-a minute of freezing cold or intense heat without AC/heat on. NTA. You dont mess with the comfort of the driver. Especially on a high/freeway.", "NTA. Your car your preference.", "NTA I use a/c A LOT. Always have. If I am hot in someone else\u2019s vehicle, I take a jacket off. Yes, if I give someone a ride who I think might be cold, I offer them to adjust the temperature.", "I wonder if what she means by hot is actually a form of car sickness. I get easily car sick especially with the windows up and it makes me feel sweaty and nauseated and like I can\u2019t breathe. So she may be experiencing something like that that the car temperature itself doesn\u2019t help.\n\nThat said I would -never- roll the window down if the driver had asked me not to (for any reason, but especially if I knew the reason why was safety related!) nor would I pout and carry on like a pork chop if I asked and was told no. NTA whatsoever!", "OP, get some sturdy fans, keep them in your car for Rose to use.\nWhen she gets hot she can move the AC cooled air around in front of her face. \n\nINFO- is there any chance at all your driving makes her nervous and she is getting hot flashes from anxiety?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
