Your offer to turn up the AC is accommodating, but what she is doing, pretending there is no other solution, is a power move. She doesn\u2019t want her body temperature accommodated, she wants you to capitulate to what she wants. First rule of any chronic ailment is to ask to be accommodated in the least restrictive method to others. She also agreed, then tried to underhandedly do what she wanted anyway thinking there was nothing you could do to stop her. She\u2019s also a grown up, whining about not getting her way is unacceptable. Tell her in the future she needs to either act like an adult or stay home.

That being said, OP should simply refuse to drive her anymore.", "It very well could be something like that. I know when a panic attack is building up  in me one thing that helps is fresh air, due to the sensation of air hunger that comes with panic attacks or intense anxiety. Still, if that was the case she could make it known so that at least OP understands it's not just some weird power struggle/whining. However as someone who also has ADHD I don't even drive because distractions can be really distracting, to the point where myself and everyone in the car and others on the road would be in danger, and she needs to understand that. It's extremely difficult to drive with ADHD and if someone does have a system that works, let them have it.", "If that's the case, she needs to start using her big girl words and say \"I have claustrophobia,\" and ALSO figure out a reasonable accommodation when her needs conflict with those of the driver.
