I like her a lot for the most part, but this instance has caused issues.\n\nRose gets hot easily and prefers to have the windows down. It doesn\u2019t matter what vehicle, what kind of weather temperature wise she needs them down. In her own, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal because she\u2019s driving. \n\nI don\u2019t mind the windows being down if we\u2019re driving through town. However, I cannot drive with windows down on the highway. I have ADHD and so driving in itself is a bit of a challenge. I\u2019ve learned how to deal with minor distractions but one I cannot get over is the sound of the windows down on the highway. \n\nI\u2019ve explained this to Rose and offered to even turn on the AC if she\u2019s truly that hot. She says she needs the windows down or else she\u2019s going to overheat. I\u2019ve told her to either wear layers in the car or again, I\u2019ll put on the AC. She\u2019s continued to do so, even after several talks with both her and Alex. My brother just kind of shrugs and says \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d Both have said there is no condition behind this preference.\n\nAs I said, Rose is a fun person, so the three of us and my girlfriend, \u201cPaige\u201d (30F) will go out often. At first, we took turns driving if we weren\u2019t Ubering somewhere but given this whole window debacle, I had stopped offering. Then Murphy\u2019s law went into place. The only available car was mine last night.\n\nWe picked up Alex and Rose, who sat in the backseat. As usual, Rose turned down the window. I told her I would be rolling it up when we got on the highway and she said that was fine and even did it herself when we pulled on. 2 minutes later, I hear the window coming down and that awful whooshing sound. I told her to put it back up and she started whining \u201cBut I\u2019m hot!\u201d I pointed out that the AC was on and that wasn\u2019t enough for her. She still refused. We came on a bit of traffic. I don\u2019t know if all cars have this, but mine has one where you can prevent the backseat from opening and closing the window. I assume it\u2019s a feature mostly for people with kids.\n\nI rolled up the window and used the feature. I don\u2019t think Rose realized I had done it, as it\u2019s a silent manuver, she just knew I rolled up the window. A little later, she tries to put it down again and it obviously doesn\u2019t work. She\u2019s getting frustrated. I tell her that it\u2019s not going to roll down and I won\u2019t unlock it until we get off the highway. She starts freaking out, telling me she\u2019s so hot and I need to open the window NOW! I tell her no and crank up the AC some more if she\u2019s that hot. Alex kept telling her to calm down, she\u2019s fine, etc. Rose whined the entire way, even when we got off the highway and I unlocked the windows. She didn\u2019t even touch them.\n\nWhen we got to our destination, Rose took an Uber home in a huff. She texted me later saying I\u2019m an asshole and if I expect her to get over being hot in the car, why can\u2019t I get over the distraction of the highway.
