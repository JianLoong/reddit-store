Or gets motion sick fast and fresh air helps.", "NTA - I\u2019m curious though, because I have a weird form of claustrophobia where I will get anxious if I\u2019m in a car without the windows down. I wonder if she has something similar, but doesn\u2019t know how to describe it? \n\nNot excusing the behaviour though. I only drive on the highway with the window cracked when it\u2019s my car and I\u2019m driving. When I am a passenger, I use it as an opportunity to build resilience and battle the phobia/anxiety. It\u2019s a struggle, but I would never ask other people to suffer for my own problem.", "NTA.  I HATE windows down while driving.  My husband does the same and I lock those windows on him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit to add: you should def always have the AC on in the car though", "My job involves dealing with claustrophobic people on a daily basis. I'm almost certain she's claustrophobic to some degree. Still think NTA, she needs to figure herself out and learn to communicate better because clearly the issue isn't simply that she's hot. Mild claustrophobia can be overcome for most people in my experience, but you have to be aware of what's really going on to work on it.", "I'll normally default to rules of the driver being comfortable above anybody else as that's the safest thing to get to your destination. Like you OP, i can't stand the wind whooshing in the  car at speeds over 50mph, let alone when some cars have wind buffeting. \n\nNTA", "NTA- You told her why you couldn't have the windows down. She should learn to listen.", "NTA you don't mess with the concentration of the person keeping you alive in a moving vehicle. Especially if it's their vehicle and they're driving. Just deal with it, it's not eternity.", "NTA. If you ever HAVE to have her in your car again, maybe try putting her in the front passenger seat with the AC blowing directly on her face? Some cars don't get much AC in the back, it gets stuffy, but never to the point I'd have a window down on the highway.", "NTA. I have a medical condition where one of the side effects is heat intolerance (i have puked and fainted from being too hot, it\u2019s not fun). i always ask if it\u2019s ok to have a window down, or cracked at the least. if the answer is no, it\u2019s not my car and i won\u2019t argue. i\u2019ll just strip a layer if i have to/i\u2019m able to. usually my friends know, so they\u2019ll offer to turn down/off heat or turn on ac for a little bit until i\u2019m at a better temp. she doesn\u2019t have a medical concern, and she\u2019s being an ass abt it. NTA for you, all the AH for her imo \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you offered a compromise, she said no and in turn made it more hazardous for you to drive", "Right? Like I get violently motion sick if I\u2019m not sitting where I can get either a straight view and cool air or feel the engine of the car (it helps if my brain can predict if the driver is slowing or stoping and tricks my brain into calming down the nausea) with cool air. If she was someone who got that motion sick then I would say E S H because OP was making it impossible for her and she for him. \n\nbut it just sounds like this woman wears her coat  in the car and doesn\u2019t remove it. Which is her issue. She needs to be able to cool herself down or pack a small handheld battery fan. \n\nAlso does she do this in sweltering heat because then it\u2019s really just about her wanting to stick her head out a window rather than \u201ccooling down\u201d \n\nI have actually had to ask people to roll up windows so the cold air would be more effective because I\u2019m on the verge of puking or needing to pull over. But if someone wasn\u2019t comfortable with that as a driver I would offer to drive since I can predict my own movements. I don\u2019t make it other people\u2019s problems. \n\nNTA OP.", "[removed]", "This is what I am thinking. Rose needs to see a doctor and have some tests run to figure out why her body isn't regulating her temp.", "I am wondering if she has a touch of claustrophobia.", "And AC is more fuel efficient than driving down the highway with windows down", "That said I would -never- roll the window down if the driver had asked me", "Same. It nauseates me.", ">windows open for her isn't less important than windows closed for you.\n\nYes it is. It's not her driving, it's not her car, he's not her parent, he's not her partner. She can kick rocks with her weird controlling behaviour.", "If she's hot then the AC should be fine. Putting the windows down is a hazard for op", "Exactly! I've been on both sides of this coin. I have ADD and have difficulty driving on highways if the windows are open, and I get super carsick if I'm a passenger and having the window open mitigates that for me. \n\nSo I always offer to drive (I fairly regularly go on 15+ hour road trips and drive the whole time myself because it's better to drive the whole time than drive half the time and spend the other half nausious with a headache). If I can't drive then I cede to the preferences of the driver. If I feel like I'm going to be sick I warn them with as much advance as possible and ask them to open the window or pull over. I don't get into a battle of the wills over window controls like an 6yo then get pissed when the driver treats me like a child.", "I\u2019ve always found the sound of windows down like nails on a chalkboard, and the faster the car is moving the worse it is. I had no idea other people felt the same way until this post!", "I doubt it's her body. OP said he cranked the AC up for her, and AC is way more effective than windows. This isn't about actual physical heat. It's something in her head.", "It may well be regulating her temperature just fine. My baseline temperature is 2\u00b0F cooler than the average person\u2019s, meaning I always feel warmer.\n\nHow a typical person feels at 74\u00b0F is how I feel at 72\u00b0F.

She is just interpreting it as \"hot\"", "True! I think they did something about that on Mythbusters years ago.", "Maybe she just does not like closed spaces? I am a bit like this, but I can manage. However, she is being enabled too much.\n\nNTA, and it's time to tell your brother you are not driving his girlfriend anymore.", "Even if there was a medical reason, it does not supersede the need to drive safely. I absolutely couldn\u2019t drive with the windows down on the highway either. The wind keeps me from seeing properly and my hair gets in my face. There\u2019s a reason that normal people have their windows up on the highway. She either needs to drive every time or figure out a solution that doesn\u2019t distract the driver", "She fat bro?", "Unless there's a motion sickness issue,  I would not even ask twice.", "Stolen from u/elephantjungle1660.", "That sounds less like a physical issue and more like a mental one for her, tbh.

It\u2019s the opposite for warmer-than-body temperatures: the difference in temperatures for me is greater, or more extreme, compared to the average person.\n\nMore extreme difference means less comfortable.", "This is such a great idea! I definitely experience issues where I feel suffocated without airflow, its not even really about temperature but I need to feel either the AC directly or a breeze from a window on my face in order to be comfortable (so sitting in a backseat in a car where the vents are only in the front is a bit miserable even though the car might be cool). I was wondering if she might be similar to me but hasn't done the reflecting to figure out the verbiage/express her actual needs/build a tolerance for discomfort. \n\nIt's not much of an issue in my life but for the rare occasion I'm in a backseat long enough for it to matter I'm gonna have to buy one!", "Totally! She really needs to manage her anxieties", "NTA. As the driver, your comfort trumps hers."]}
