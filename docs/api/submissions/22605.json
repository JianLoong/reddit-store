Catching up, reminiscing, NOTHING SEXUAL. Everything seemed great & I thought we were re-connecting. \r  \n\r  \nA week later, I asked if she wanted to meet. She agreed & I was excited. I made reservations at a restaurant I knew she would like & texted her to confirm. She replied \u201cITS A DATE\u201d. I get to the restaurant, text her \u201cIm here\u201d & ask for her ETA. NO RESPONSE. I message, text, & call her. NO RESPONSE. I wait in my car wondering whats going on? Is she hurt? Is her battery dead? Any excuse I could think of to justify this behavior. After an hour of waiting I went home. \r  \n\r  \nThe next morning I wake up to texts from her apologizing for not showing up, but no explanation. I ask if shes ok. She replies shes fine & changes the topic. \r  \nWe kept talking after that & I once again ask her to meet. She says she would love to. This time, I dont drive to the restaurant until I get confirmation, but that confirmation never came. \r  \nThe next morning its Deja Vu. Apology texts, but no explanations. \r  \n\r  \nThrough our conversations I learned that shes in financial trouble. I tell her that if things go well between us id be happy to help, but seeing as how shes living with her EX, I haven't seen her in 6 yrs & shes bailed on me multiple times, I would need to regain my trust for her. She replies- \u201cI don\u2019t need a sugar daddy. Im capable of taking care of myself.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nSkip to a week later, I get a call at 2am from her asking if she could come over. I say yes.

She said she would love to. \r  \nThe next day, she asks if I could drop her off at the airport. I said yes! The day arrives that I\u2019m supposed to drop her off and ONCE AGAIN\u2026.NOTHING. I hear back from her 2 days later claiming she broke her phone. \r  \n\r  \nSHE DID THIS 4 MORE TIMES. \r  \n\r  \nThis is the part where I may be the asshole. Two days ago she sends me a screenshot of an email she received from her landlord claiming they are starting Eviction proceedings. I replied \u201cim sorry this is happening.\u201d The following morning she sends me a message calling me an asshole for not offering to pay her rent. I replied that she has bailed every time we were supposed to hang, all we do is text, & I dont trust her based on her past behavior. \r  \nAfter calling me names & arguing with me she said. \u201cIF YOU REALLY CARED ABOUT ME, THEN YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN MONEY, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.\u201d I thought that a was a ridiculous statement! My friends & family are on my side.

Her  repeated poor behavior should have made you bounce long ago. You have value. You do not need to tolerate being treated so poorly. \n\nI disagree with your colleague.

No one is worth this much drama...", "NTA\nShe is the AH.  She isn\u2019t interested in you she is only interested in your money.

Sorry to say it, but it sounds like she\u2019s playing you to try to get money out of you. I\u2019m in a social work-type job, and I\u2019ve seen strangers run scams exactly like this to some of my clients. Unfortunately, some are way too trusting and have given hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to their \u201cgirlfriend\u201d only to never hear from her again. If she\u2019s willing to take your money but not meet you in person, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not you she\u2019s interested in.", "Also be wary of that coworker who said you should have paid. No one in their right mind would think that. You work with a scammer", "Nta. She dong need a sugar daddy.", "You're definitely NTA for not taking responsibility for her financial disaster. \n\nPlease don't get involved with her further - something is going on, addiction, mental health, something isn't right here.", "NTA\n\nIf you wanted a relationship, empathizing and offering her to crash with you would have been generous, sure. Offering to pay her rent? Not a normal thing to expect.", "I\u2019m going to give you some free advice, I\u2019ve shared this with friends who have also considered getting back together with an ex, they never follow it, and eventually things go bad. \u201c. There is a reason she is your ex\u201d. Say it out loud to yourself ten times then delete her phone number.", "NTA \n\nShe told you she didn't want/need a sugar daddy, that she could take care of herself.  She can't say this and then get upset with you for not giving her money.  You're better off without her. Just cut all ties and move on.", "Bro, the fact you had to ask if YTA speaks volumes. Get as far away from this toxic person as possible. Block her number, and dont answer her in any way, shape, or form. You are not some coat she can try on whenever she wants.\n\nDo better for yourself...", "NTA but if you give her even a penny it would be the dumbest decision ever.  You could set yourself on fire with all the red flags she is showing.", "She didn't come because she couldn't find an excuse to get away from her partner. They aren't exes, she was just saying that to get something out of you. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nShe's playing games and you keep falling for it. She's an ex for a reason. Cut ties, block her, and move on.", ">I tell her that if things go well between us id be happy to help\n\nSorry to say, but this part is kind of assholish OP. Kind of comes off as if you are holding money over her head when you know she is in bad financial straits. Her reply was appropriate.\n\nAs far as the rent goes NTA. You don't owe her rent money lol, especially after she's been flaking on you. Honestly, I would have given up after the second time. Sounds like she is playing games with you, and you may have too much lingering attachment to her. I would just cut her out of your life at this point.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
