We were having a good wedding until the speeches happened. Now i thought it was common sense to not do this, but during the best man's speech he decided to propose to his girlfriend. She said yes and all hell broke loose.\n\nFrom that point on, no one paid attention to me or my husband nor paid attention to the event times. People starting eating early, the speeches were cut short after he proposed, on top of that he got the dj to play him and his girlfriend \"their song\". Which incited a whole bunch of couples to do the same. For about 3 hours it was just couples running to the dj to play \"their song\" and hogging the dance floor. When me and my husband finally got a chance to dance people were to exhausted and didn't pay attention, they instead went to eat.\n\nAfter several hours of this, i told my husband I didn't really want to be here anymore, and he agreed. We ended up leaving, the only person we said goodbye to was our parents. Nobody even noticed we had left.\n\nNow here's the problem. 3 days after the wedding a cousin of mine had asked me when did i leave my wedding, as she never got to say goodbye. I told her we left early because nobody was paying attention nor cared enough to. She said ok and hanged up. Now we've been getting calls from all our relatives telling us we're immature and need to lighten up. That we should be happy our wedding made people this romantic.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1693725429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168qd4r/aita_for_leaving_my_own_wedding_early/", "score": 2908, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That said, you, your husband or the maitre de should have stepped in, taken the mic and gotten the wedding back on the rails. If you weren't paying someone else to manage the event, it falls to you and your husband as the hosts. That doesn't make the best man less of an asshole, but I don't think the other couples have quite the same responsibility you think they do. They must have thought it was fine when nobody ever stepped in, and i can't blame them - you never said otherwise. The only expectation people have about weddings is that the honored couple decides where the line is drawn and their word is law. Otherwise insane asks and developments are not only acceptable at weddings, they're typical. So a wedding isn't off the rails until the honored couple raise their voices and say it is. I think you did have a responsibility to assert yourself and ask people to stick to the event schedule, and while you have a right to leave the event whenever you want, you ARE the hosts, so it's actually rude to do so without saying anything!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: the topic is literally \"AITA for leaving early\" not \"AITA for being upset when the best man proposed at my wedding and started making song requests\"\n\nthey were the fucking wedding couple. They watched their wedding go off the rails without taking the reins and then left their own wedding without saying ANYTHING and now they're blaming everyone else at the wedding - the entire guest list - because the wedding went off the rails while they failed to step in and, yeah, people are calling feeling blindsided about it. If you're at a wedding and people are calling in their own songs and the wedding couple are right there not protesting, do you REALLY think you're going to step in on their behalf? Realistically? Likewise, when everyone's getting up to get food, you might glance at the wedding schedule and say \"oh, it's not supposed to be time yet\" and you might look for the wedding couple and ask for confirmation, but when the wedding couple aren't on the mic asking people to stop taking food, eventually you're going to get up and fill up your own plate before all the food disappears. At any other event you ultimately hold the hosts responsible for keeping the event on schedule. A wedding is no different.\n\nthey way they left was inappropriate and the guests are not responsible for managing the wedding for them. It's their wedding, they manage the vendors and the event itself. If you go to a convention and things stop happening according to the event plan, people are not going to just stick to the event plan. They're going to do what they see other people doing. If someone calls fire in a crowded theatre AND THE THEATRE DOESNT GET ON THE INTERCOM TO SAY OTHERWISE, people aren't going to sit there and wait for the movie to start just because it's what was scheduled. They're going to watch people exit the theatre and follow suit. This is literally group psychology 101. It's why decent people get roped in to mob behavior, it's why bullying happens and it's the same reason this wedding happened the way it did. Not my circus, not my monkeys. It was their circus, and these were their monkeys to manage. The people who originally acted out are responsible for their own behavior, but the hosts are responsible for keeping the wedding on the rails and dictating what is acceptable behavior, and by the sounds of it, they totally checked out.", "YTA. You're all TA. Esh. Sheesh", "I guess you are the asshole for not getting photos with your family.", "Everyone sort of sucks here ,this is one of my biggest issues with weddings in general.

That feeling when you're at a party with your spouse it doesn't matter if there are 50 people or 0 there . You're happy just being there with them. I have often said it doesn't matter the active or the event it's about who you are with. \n\nOne thing people should take away from this story is if you don't want anyone to purpose at your wedding make that very clear on the invite.

The father had gone NC decades ago, and the mother did not bother to show up. I'm still pissed now, ten years later and declined to leave the DJ a Yelp review as he asked.

The speeches were cut short after the best man went off script, and it sounds like after that the wedding went off the rails as people got out of their seats to congratulate the best man and his new fiancee. The next thing on the schedule would have been the dances. According to the OP, for THREE HOURS people were doing requests and dances before the wedding couple danced.
