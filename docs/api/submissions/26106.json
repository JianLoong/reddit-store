We were having a good wedding until the speeches happened. Now i thought it was common sense to not do this, but during the best man's speech he decided to propose to his girlfriend. She said yes and all hell broke loose.\n\nFrom that point on, no one paid attention to me or my husband nor paid attention to the event times. People starting eating early, the speeches were cut short after he proposed, on top of that he got the dj to play him and his girlfriend \"their song\". Which incited a whole bunch of couples to do the same. For about 3 hours it was just couples running to the dj to play \"their song\" and hogging the dance floor. When me and my husband finally got a chance to dance people were to exhausted and didn't pay attention, they instead went to eat.\n\nAfter several hours of this, i told my husband I didn't really want to be here anymore, and he agreed. We ended up leaving, the only person we said goodbye to was our parents. Nobody even noticed we had left.\n\nNow here's the problem. 3 days after the wedding a cousin of mine had asked me when did i leave my wedding, as she never got to say goodbye. I told her we left early because nobody was paying attention nor cared enough to. She said ok and hanged up. Now we've been getting calls from all our relatives telling us we're immature and need to lighten up.

Might be a human one but I don't think they wanna go through the trouble.", "I was wondering this exact thing as well, sadly.", "Make sure it's something owned by Disney, so if it ends up online, it'll get flagged and removed for copyright infringement.", "I this Polkarama by Weird Al would be a great choice here", "OP technically you don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d the raw images from the photographer, you\u2019re just paying for the service. (Used to be a photographer.). However, you might be able to make sure those images never see the light of day. And would (as nicely as you can) remind the photographer that his/her contract is with you and they shouldn\u2019t be selling any of those images to anyone else since you paid for their time, not the best/worst man. \n\nAnd frankly, I\u2019d see if the tog would be amenable to deleting those files altogether. I mean, are you ever going to want the post-speech images or are they just going to trigger you?  I had a couple of things from my wedding (not nearly so serious) and 51 years later, they still bother me.", "I was thinking of the Pok\u00e9mon polka song which I think is also by weird al", "I didn't know that.  He should do that.", "Yes, in the US at least. Part of the standard photography contract. It\u2019s a professional service and generally that\u2019s all you\u2019re paying for\u2014the service and some product but not the originals, which are generally copyrighted. But in a case like this, most photographers would be helpful I think at making sure that those professional images of the proposal and surrounding hoopla don\u2019t get into the hands of the others. \n\nWord of advice\u2014read your photography contract carefully before signing. Almost all photographers are honest but you need to understand what you are and aren\u2019t paying for in the US."]}
