She was texting her dad about this older man (40) she was talking to and saying how she was falling in love with him. He was very concerned and reached out to my mom to see if she was aware of what was going on. (They are recently divorced and it has been very messy) My mom claimed that there was no harm as they were only friends and they were only talking. He asked my sister and I if we knewthis guy but we didn't know him either. My half sister was telling us more stuff like how she agreed to be his girlfriend, how they went to the beach, etc. The last text she sent was she was going on vacation with this guy and to never expect to hear from her again. We kept asking our mom and she kept saying she knew the whole situation and it was fine. My sister and I were so concerned that this guy was going to take her away that we called the cops to help us figure out what to do. The cops showed up at my mom's place of work to question her and showed up at this guy's house to question him too. Thanks to the cops were abel to find out that my half sister was actually stalking this guy who turned her down because he knew she was under age. (She works at a cleaning company who cleans the gym he works out at). He gave the cops his phone and computer to show he wasn't hiding anything and they let him go. He had his lawyer draw up papers to sue my half sister. (He was getting death threats and threats to shut down his business because of her \"joke\". We told him if he sued we would testify on his behalf) My half sister told everyone that it was \"joke\" and that we shouldn't have taken it seriously. My mom thinks it's hilarious and that it was a wonderful prank. I tried telling her that she almost destroyed an innocent man's life by lying but she claims that my half sister didn't lie. I told my mom she should have punished my half sister and her response was to ask if she should beat her like how she beat me and my sister. I told her no that she should take away her phone, ground her from social media or something but she won't becuse actually the only ones who were in trouble were my sister and me.I told my mom that I hope my half sister gets sued so she can learn that there are consequences for her actions. My mom demands an apology from both of us for calling the cops and for beingon this guy's side. Few people told us we did the right thing but other friends and family have my mom's side and believe we are in the wrong.
