By noticing PINS (events and behaviors that often precede violence), individuals can better predict violence before it occurs and, therefore, take the necessary precautions and actions to stay safe. The Gift of Fear also describes de Becker's MOSAIC Threat Assessment Systems, which have been employed by various celebrities and government agencies to predict and prevent violence.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Forced Teaming - This is when a person implies that they have something in common with their chosen victim, acting as if they have a shared predicament when that isn't really true.

Let's go in.\"\n\n*- We're neighbors!*   \n*- We're doing our laundry/garbage/shopping together!*   \n\n\n* Charm and Niceness - This is being polite and friendly to a chosen victim in order to manipulate him or her by disarming their mistrust.\n\n*- I'm checking in on you! I'm making sure you're safe!*   \n*- \"he always gets very touchy and tries to hug me or hold my hand whenever we meet.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Too many details - If a person is lying they will add excessive details to make themselves sound more credible to their chosen victim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Typecasting - An insult is used to get a chosen victim who would otherwise ignore one to engage in conversation to counteract the insult. For example: \"Oh, I bet you're too stuck-up to talk to a guy like me.\" The tendency is for the chosen victim to want to prove the insult untrue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Loan Sharking - Giving unsolicited help to the chosen victim and anticipating they'll feel obliged to extend some reciprocal openness in return.\n\n*- Checking in, making sure you're safe. Walking with you to the garbage/laundry*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The Unsolicited Promise - A promise to do (or not do) something when no such promise is asked for; this usually means that such a promise will be broken. For example: an unsolicited, \"I promise I'll leave you alone after this,\" usually means the chosen victim will not be left alone. Similarly, an unsolicited \"I promise I won't hurt you\" usually means the person intends to hurt their chosen victim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Discounting the Word \"No\" - Refusing to accept rejection.\n\n*- He agreed to leave you alone and then SHOWED UP IN YOUR APARTMENT.*", "NTA", "i was rather surprised too.

This is dangerous. He knows your routine now and everything you do. Take precautions, seek help.", "NTA! What?! Going into your apartment and waiting for you? That\u2019s super weird behaviour, your friends should be supporting you on this. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening, it\u2019s so, so stressful to have issues with neighbours - especially older male neighbours when you\u2019re a young woman. \n\nWhen I\u2019d just had my first baby (I was young at that point - I could legally buy alcohol but I got IDed each time I did!) I had a male neighbour about 50 years old, and he would come through out back gate and then walk in our back door, whenever he wanted. I might be breastfeeding the baby, or in my underwear - he would just walk in any talk at me for hours until my husband came home. I asked him not to, my husband asked him not to, but he just ignored it. I found it really scary. Then when I moved into a flat by myself, the man downstairs didn\u2019t like me and reported me to the landlords for anything even slightly wrong that I did. Leave the hall light on? Reported. Visitors pressed the wrong button? Reported. He could see a bra through my window (and I was on the first floor, with blinds on my windows\u2026.he would have had to really peer in to see it) - reported! I was afraid to move or breathe in the end, I hated it. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I have any advice, other than that you should not feel pressured to accept his friendship and advances. It will encourage him to be more weird. Lock your doors, interact in a really minimal way\u2026and keep a rape alarm close by, probably? Some men are so frightening.", "*\\*Mark would come over to my place unannounced many times and ring the bell for multiple minutes or so , sometimes i was busy showering during these moments , sometimes i wasnt even home and he would ring my dorbell and BANG against my door. (i have a digital alarm / camera system which records whoever rings on my door)\\**\n\nCreepy! Stalker behavior!  If your apartments are built in a way that someone can hear the shower running, he was hoping you'd come out and answer the door less than fully dressed\n\n*\\*if i asked him why he did that , and if something happened , he just replied he wanted to see me. alright , not so bad.\\**\n\nNo, very bad!  The only reason for ringing for an extended period or pounding on your door is if there are very good reasons to think that something bad is happening in your apartment - like there are visible flames, water running out from under your door, or a hazardous smell in the hallway\n\n*\\*Eventually mark began leaving his door open all day long , his couch was almost right away towards the door , he could therefore always tell when i was leaving and coming back. at first i believed he just wanted to let some air come through , but no , that wasnt the case.\\**\n\nYou're cluing in here! Stalker behavior again.\n\n*\\*whenever i opened my own door to leave or come back inside he would rush into the hallway to talk to me. When i bring out the trash he follows me , when i do my laundry he suddenly is there too , whenever i go shopping he suddenly has to go shopping in the same supermarket. Let alone the fact that he always gets very touchy and tries to hug me or hold my hand whenever we meet.\\**\n\nSo many red flags!  Following you and trying for physical contact without permission or an ongoing relationship is not okay!\n\n*\\*I was very uncomfortable and decided to let him know that i didnt want to continue our 'friendship' if he acted this way. He seemed puzzled but apologized , he said he was very thankful for how i welcomed him and how i helped him settle in , and that he got probably a bit too excited.\\**\n\nGood for you!  But he's playing \"puzzled\" and dismissing your concerns by saying he was just grateful for a welcome and \"too excited\".  Don't believe this!\n\n*\\*With that me and mark didnt talk for a while except for the ocassional \"hello\" and \"bye\", if we crossed paths. i was hopeful things would be normal again , but no. \\**\n\nHe was just letting things cool off a bit before resuming his hunt.\n\n*\\*Last night i was doing my laundry in the community washroom. i took around 20-30 minutes since i had a lot of laundry , when i came back upstairs , i saw that the light in my appartement was on. i was certain i didnt have it on when i left.\\**\n\nDanger! Trust your gut next time and call for someone to go into your apartment with you if it's not as you left it.\n\n*\\*Thats the big shocker. i unlock my door \\**\n\nHe LOCKED THE DOOR behind him so he would be sure that only you would walk in on him in your apartment\n\n*\\*and suddenly mark stands in my appartement looking around. i got so freaked out i screamed.\\**\n\nGood for you!  Be loud when you're in danger! Don't worry about offending others or being perceived as over-reacting - too many young women have \"polite-d\" themselves into a worse situation.\n\n*\\*Apprently i didnt properly close the door\\**\n\nI wouldn't count on that! Get your locks changed!\n\n*\\*and mark ended up somehow seeing. (was he peeking? i dont know.) \\**\n\nYES! he was monitoring your movements\n\n*\\*anyhow , he decided to go inside to 'check', if everything was okay.\\**\n\nUm, no, he went inside to nose around your stuff, possibly to scope out how to plant cameras, possibly to plan other 'events', possibly just to touch the things you touch.  If he was \"checking\" he would have left the door open, he would have called out to you, and he would have left as soon as he saw you weren't home.  Check your doorbell cam for whether he called your name or slipped in and how long he was in the apartment\n\n*\\*i ended up loosing it and called him all the names in the book. a creep , disgusting , a stalker. i threw him out of my appartement and that was that for now. i told my friends about the incident , but they ended up calling me sensitive and just being scared of men , since he was trying to be nice.\\**\n\nAgain, GOOD FOR YOU! Stand your ground and be loud! However, recognize that you and Mark are alone on your floor and that reduces the number of people who might hear you.  It's time to move to a different floor (minimum) or a different building (preferable)\n\n**Your friend are either na\u00efve or stupid.

A police report is appropriate.  Changing your locks is, too.  Adding other security to your door would be smart.  Report this to your apartment management.\n\nWhile you probably won't get this answer from management, I wonder whether Mark scoped out the building and chose an apartment on your floor because he saw that you were the only resident there (whether he asked management about the neighbors or looked through windows or something else, I couldn't guess)\n\nBe safe, OP.

He is trying to SEEM like he is being nice  so that you look bad when you shut him down. He\u2019s literally stalking you and then gaslighting you about his actions being normal friendliness.", "No. She told him he wasn't welcome. If he's THAT bad with social clues, he can't live independently and needs help.", "I have many autistic friends\n\nDo you wanna guess how many of them entered into my home without my consent or presence? Throw a number.", "Just want to ditto that is this a STALKER situation.", "This! The first thing I thought when he started with the banging on the door was stalker! Report him to the police AND the building management", "Yeah I am really surprised that wasn't part of the post. I would have checked that asap and included in the post. I have a feel if she did check it, she would see that he saw her left and ran into her apartment.\n\n100% creep.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from, but if he moves, he still knows her place of residency and that won\u2019t stop a stalker from coming back. Having her relocate can increase the chance that he won\u2019t get to her because he doesn\u2019t know where she lives now. If he finds out her new place of residency, that\u2019s just more evidence to demonstrate that OP is definitely dealing with a stalker.", "While true, if the landlord moves him to a different unit then he will still know what unit she is in. Hopefully if she moved units then he wouldn't at least not right away", "Yep. I would place bets. I'm 50f btw. I just didn't get to this age without a lot of disgust.  He sounds like a predator", "You aren\u2019t wrong about that.  Wanting him to go away without escalation on his part is the problem.", "Not to sound over the top, but please make sure he didn\u2019t put a camera anywhere.", "I would add that finding anyone as anything is terrifying.", "And get some pepper spray.", "Yup he didn\u2019t notice the door opened, he straight up opened it and went inside once he saw her leave, this dudes dangerous, everything before the talk where she laid down the boundaries I could let go of maybe he\u2019s socially awkward or ok maybe he\u2019s JUST a nice guy, but anything after that is a major red flag, any sane man would be so embarrassed and awkward from being told to back off like that so you know there\u2019s something wrong where he thinks it\u2019s perfectly fine to reassert himself into her life like that jus t because he thinks \u201cnow time has gone by and the coast is clear\u201d", "Against her will", "Or worse. This has Lifetime Special written all over it!", "I think that perhaps that might be a stretch. It sounds more likely to me that that Mark may be neurodivergent and doesn\u2019t know boundaries. \n\nThat is no excuse, and OP is absolutely entitled to her reaction. Even as a man I would be freaked out to find someone I\u2019ve asked to keep their distance from me standing inside my home. \n\nMark trespassed on her property at a minimum, first thing would be to call the police and have them officially inform him. Then, NAL, but I don\u2019t think that a TRO would be out of order in this situation. If Mark is ordered to stay 500 feet away from OP at all times, he will have no choice but to move.

He escalated the matter the moment he entered your apartment, whether you left the door slightly ajar or not (which I doubt you did). Obviously, from now on, lock your door when you leave to do laundry or take out trash, but even if you didn't lock it that one time, he had no right to enter your apartment. \nShow the police the video. Heck, it probably clearly shows if the door was properly closed or not. Take whatever legal action you're entitled to take.\n\nEdit - re-reading your post, you say you had to unlock your door to get in? That surely must mean you locked it when you left, or AT LEAST left it closed behind you. If you took your keys with you, you were expecting to need them upon return. He let himself in, turned on lights that weren't already on & locked the door behind himself! He did these things with BAD INTENTIONS! Please, please contact the police and tell them everything you posted here about the incident, along with showing them the video!", "This.  It\u2019s not too late to call the cops.", "Send Mark to your friends house and see how they like it.", "Same, sis.  This rang every one of my warning bells.  And I was also waaaaayyy too trusting at 21.", "Definitely be worried about this. No one goes in to check to see if there's any problems and locks the door....", "That isn't the least bit over the top.", "I hate that this thought that too!", "Fucking hell, that sounds so creepy and so possible given OP's experience so far. Until you get away, OP, please check out every corner of your apartment.", "I\u2019d be hiring someone to go through my apartment to look for them. My eyebrows just got higher and higher the more I read through the post.  This guy screams stalker and her friends are saying she\u2019s exaggerating??!  NTA AND she needs to drop her friends.", "I had to do this once. To check, look at every outlet in the house and make sure anything plugged in is yours. This also goes for extension chords/anywhere with a usb entrance. Cameras wont last long without power so you can feel secure if you do this and dont find anything.", "It\u2019s not a stretch. She said he\u2019s unnecessarily touchy and tries to hold her hand. Those are not the actions of a friend, those are the actions of a potential suitor. Stop playing devils advocate for this guy, it\u2019s pretty apparent that he\u2019s a creep. Fuck off with that \u201coh he might be autistic give him a break\u201d that is no excuse for being touchy and literally invading someone\u2019s apartment.", "Neurodivergence often makes it more difficult to read signals properly, but that's not the issue here. OP clearly, verbally indicated his behaviour was unwanted. At that point, ND or not, he knew he should stop. It's not fair to actual ND people to blame stalking on neurodivergence.", "I'm autistic and I know damn well not to go into other people's homes without permission.", "It's SO creepy!   I would totally freak out and spray him in the face with pepper spray.   I have dealt with a stalker / mentally unstable man, before and would NOT take this lightly.  Do not hesitate to call 911.  \n\nI have a next door neighbor with felony stalking charges and I called 911 several times.   Don't be scared to dial.   I had to call the first time when the neighbor had a ladder up to the window when I was taking a bath.\n\nThe \"friends\" are terrible to be so dismissive of OP.\n\nYou are not sensitive.   His actions are ILLEGAL.\n\nPress charges!   Trespassing at least.", "> which I doubt you did\n\nYou're probably right.  OP, he may have obtained a copy of your key.  Please insist on having the locks changed right away.", "That was my thought!\n\nMy husband and I are in an apartment and one day we came home to see our neighbor\u2019s door had clearly been smashed open and was wide open. It was like 11 p.m. and there had been an ex that had been sitting outside her door and banging on it for a few hours the days leading up, so we immediately yelled into the apartment asking if she was home and ok. We didn\u2019t hear anything so we called the police.\n\nThankfully she wasn\u2019t home and the ex just robbed a bunch of electronics and has left her alone since, but there\u2019s no way we would have went into her apartment and locked the door behind us?\n\nIf she had responded that she needed help when we called in, we would have entered to help her, but without that consent there is no reason we would have felt justified in doing something like that.", "Yes, you\u2019re right, I forgot about that part.  Although it is still indicative behavior of someone on the spectrum. \n\nI hoped that I was pretty clear that it was **not** an excuse nor acceptable behavior. Which is why I offered some fairly aggressive actions in response. \n\nNothing in my comment says, \u201cgive him a break.\u201d  FFS, I said to call the police and gave advice on how to get him kicked out of his home. How in the the hell is that giving him a break? \n\nI\u2019d hate to see what your version of being harsh is, beheading? \ud83e\ude93", "I\u2019m not. I thought that I pretty clearly said that neurodivergence was **not** an excuse. And I\u2019m truly sorry, but I don\u2019t see where I\u2019m blaming ND people for stalking behavior, the two are not co-related. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the Director of HR in me who after 45 years feels the need to look into the underlying issues of individuals behavior. I\u2019m trained annually to dissect harassing conduct into individual elements and develop a plan on how to move forward with the best interests of all parties. \n\nIn this particular situation, the best interest of the OP is served by removing the potential threat as soon as possible. If this were an employment situation, I would be terminating Mark. Maybe as the employer I may know of some circumstances with Mark, or they may just be my determination as a trained observer, but they are irrelevant to the issue at hand. My obligation is to remove the danger to others. \n\nI\u2019m not defending Mark, I\u2019m not excusing the behavior, I\u2019m not blaming ND people for stalking.

My neighbor noticed and, since they don't have my contact info, they let admin know. Admin contacted me to check if I was okay and if it was an error.

(Not went)", "JUST BECUASE SOMEONE DOESNT FOLLOW SOCIAL NORMS DOESNT MEAN THEY\u2019RE AUTISTIC. Get the fuck out of here with this glamourization of creepy behavior and trying to make it explainable. You sound like a fucking r/niceguy from the peanut gallery trying to stick up for his own kind. If we could behead creeps that nonconsentually touch women I think the world would be a much better place.", "Bro calm down. He is obviously not on the creeps side. I also got the same vibes from the story. Nobody is glamourising anything."]}
