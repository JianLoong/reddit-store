By noticing PINS (events and behaviors that often precede violence), individuals can better predict violence before it occurs and, therefore, take the necessary precautions and actions to stay safe.

Let's go in.\"\r  \n\r  \nCharm and Niceness - This is being polite and friendly to a chosen victim in order to manipulate him or her by disarming their mistrust.\r  \n\r  \nToo many details - If a person is lying they will add excessive details to make themselves sound more credible to their chosen victim.\r  \n\r  \nTypecasting - An insult is used to get a chosen victim who would otherwise ignore one to engage in conversation to counteract the insult. For example: \"Oh, I bet you're too stuck-up to talk to a guy like me.\" The tendency is for the chosen victim to want to prove the insult untrue.\r  \n\r  \nLoan Sharking - Giving unsolicited help to the chosen victim and anticipating they'll feel obliged to extend some reciprocal openness in return.\r  \n\r  \nThe Unsolicited Promise - A promise to do (or not do) something when no such promise is asked for; this usually means that such a promise will be broken. For example: an unsolicited, \"I promise I'll leave you alone after this,\" usually means the chosen victim will not be left alone.
