Whenever we go on family holidays, I always end up on the couch and/or sharing a room and my sibling and their spouse get a room to themselves. This has happened on every single family holiday/get together since they got married. Whether we\u2019re staying at an Airbnb or at a family member\u2019s house, it\u2019s always assumed I\u2019ll take the couch and they\u2019ll take the guest bedroom. \n\nNow the current situation: months ago we planned a trip with our cousins (+ partners). My sibling said they weren\u2019t sure they would come and they missed every single \u201cdeadline\u201d for confirmation before booking that we set. They always said they\u2019d let us know if they decided to come in the end. My cousins and I continued planning the trip and booked a 2 bedroom apartment. The master bedroom with a king bed and en-suite bathroom. The other bedroom with 2 queen beds and en-suite bathroom. The couch has a pullout double bed as well. \n\nMy cousins (2 cousins + partners) and I agreed we\u2019d split the bill equally per person and pull papers from a bowl to see who got the master. I got the master bedroom and they will be sharing the guest room. The trip is coming up in a week and yesterday my sibling said they want to join after all. We\u2019re all happy they want to come along and we gave them all the relevant info. Now, prices for booking last minute are very high compared to the fare we got when we booked months ago so my sibling wants to stay with us since they know the apartment fits 8. That\u2019s fine with us but when I told my sibling they\u2019d get the couch, it\u2019s like they short circuited and they couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d have a bedroom to myself while they (+ spouse) get the couch. In their head, as the only single person on the trip it\u2019s understood I\u2019d take the couch in the living room. \n\nWhen I explained how we distributed the rooms and that I wasn\u2019t giving up the bed, my sibling started calling me an asshole and accused me of not wanting them to come. I think this is ridiculous and they\u2019re welcome to pay for a room elsewhere if they don\u2019t want the couch. My cousins are staying out of it but did say they understood where my sibling was coming from. My parents are telling me to take the couch, keep the peace and enjoy the trip. While no one (other than my sibling) is calling me an asshole, I do feel like they\u2019re judging me for not giving up my room so I figured I\u2019d ask internet strangers if I\u2019m really being an asshole or if I\u2019m justified in wanting to keep the bed.", "created_utc": 1691461625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l4xiy/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_room/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sucks because it seems like your sibling has your cousins on their side somewhat, which will just make the trip awkward at times. Good luck.", "Nta. Keep the big bed. It's their own fault there's not enough rooms. Maybe they should stop being selfish. You should also demand that your family treat you better.", "NTA\n\nThe siblings shoulda made up their minds earlier and you could have gotten a 3 bedroom.", "NTA \u2014 You snooze you lose the master bedroom. \n\nIf they don\u2019t want to sleep on the couch then they can book themselves a hotel room or an Airbnb. they should have been involved in planning the trip instead of inserting themselves into your plans at the last minute. They had plenty of time to say \u201cyes we\u2019d love to join you!\u201d but instead they wasted time waffling about and when they finally came to a decision the place was booked and the rooms were full. \n\nGet yourself one of those travel locks that can secure any door because I can guarantee they\u2019ll try to take the suite if they stay with y\u2019all. Also make it absolutely clear that since they chose to tag along at the last second they will have to accommodate your sleeping arrangements and at this point, if they still don\u2019t want to sleep on the couch then they can book themselves a hotel room or an Airbnb for the trip or just skip this trip because they sound like such walking headaches if they did get alternate sleeping arrangements they\u2019d either be complaining (if they lose) or gloating (if they win) the whole trip. \n\nAlso, you deserve a bed! It\u2019s crazy to me that it\u2019s ALWAYS you sleeping on the couch, that\u2019s just not right. When my partner died and I had to move back in with my parents my dad offered to take the couch so I could take the big bed until I got my old room set up (I said no, we moved my old mattress to another room until my space was ready and I could replace my ancient mattress). Like, it shouldn\u2019t always be you on the couch, it sucks that couples get preferential treatment. My MIL didn\u2019t give a damn about couples, first come first served last ones there got the converted couches in the basement so it was always a race to her place for the holidays to get the best room next to the fireplace. \n\nAnyway I\u2019ve gone off track, NTA. \n\nTL;DR NTA, ya snooze ya lose, tell them to take the couch or take a hike to their own hotel room or airbnb.

It was the little sister and partner who were last to answer and had the living-room\u2026 24h upon arrival she had a full tantrum then meltdown requiring the room we had. That was the start of the ugliest behaviours I had witnessed. From both siblings and their partner, while we were clear about not wanting to engage while they were refusing to stop yelling and screaming -like talk to us. They went nasty, insulting and physically menacing.", "NTA - not at all.  Your sister is late to the party and everything had already been decided.

There will be plenty of room for both of them on the pull out couch", "NTA\n\n\n\nMy family and friends don't suck and I honestly can't grasp how you can expect an adult person to pay fully and be okay with not even getting a bed. Especially if you get involved after everything is planned.", "NTA. Screw them. They procrastinated, they get the couch. They are welcome to book a different location to stay.\n\nJust because you are single does not mean you should get the short end of the stick in these situations.", "NTA your sibling is out of luck.", "NTA - 30+ is the point where couches don\u2019t work anymore. Demand a bed now and in the future, your parents/family seem like AHs to me if they don\u2019t understand this.", "NTA.

I would always be made to sit on the hump in my aunt's z28, in front of the gear shifter in my dad's truck, etc. Being the \"short stick\" sucks!", "Yeah, that\u2019s my thought as well; if sleeping on the couch is apparently so degrading that it is room for allegations that OP is trying too force their sibling out of the vacation (that they never RSVPed for), it should be equally degrading for OP to always end up on the couch, and apparently no one really wants them to come to the family vacations and holidays! They have been hinting this by putting them on the couch for years! /s\n\n\u2026or is it just that the brother (and parents) doesn\u2019t see OP as an equally important part of the family, because they don\u2019t have a significant other and/or a child? (Evidenced by the \u201cshort circuiting\u201d - what? Are you worth your own room like a human being, just like me?! Outrageous! /s) \n\n\u2026or is it some kind of older sibling - younger sibling cr*p, that really should stop mattering once you\u2019re out of the teens, and *really* should stop mattering when you\u2019re both in your thirties!!\n\n\u2026or maybe the brother waited until last minute to RSVP so that he could tag along at a vacation that was already paid for, and that he wouldn\u2019t have to put any effort in planning and dealing with booking fees and trip advisor readings? That would be cheaper because you booked for fewer people? They ARE paying part of the apartment, I hope? \n\nNTA"]}
