Now she\u2019s working at the high school I\u2019m suing and our pregnant principal will inevitably be involved. I personally tried to avoid her getting involved but it doesn\u2019t seem possible. End tldr\r  \n\r  \nSimply put, at age 20 I fucked up. Hard. Didn\u2019t take college seriously, and I failed out. Totally expelled.\r  \n\r  \nI realized my horrible mistake then and I still do now. I admit, I attempted harassing multiple college s for readmission until I got cease and desist letters from literally all of them. This was when I was 22.\r  \n\r  \n3 years into the future, now I\u2019m 25. I moved cross-country, California to Florida (driving no less but that\u2019s a different story). Mainly because I figured colleges there do not know me and I can finally start over. I spent years working to afford college again, at least partially. It\u2019s hard work too, I work everyday, except Saturdays, for 12 hours sometimes. All to fix my mistakes I made when I was 20.\r  \n\r  \nRecently I almost got accepted into a community college, which I will work my way up from. I tried to get my high school transcripts only to discover they\u2019ve since been encrypted by ransomware. I tried asking what they will do to mitigate this problem, seeing it\u2019s their own fault. They told me they\u2019d do nothing. So I began a lawsuit process.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where my old friend comes into the picture. She works at the high school and knows the principal well. The principal is pregnant with a child and apparently she will inevitably get involved. Old friend is not happy that I\u2019m effectively suing a pregnant woman, potentially causing the baby to die from all the stress of a lawsuit.\r  \n\r  \nI tried explaining my point, that I made serious mistakes when I was 20, and that I\u2019ve spent five years trying to fix them. Then when the high school we went to fucks up and almost ruins my future, all they say is \u201coops sorry\u201d. There must be consequences for their screwups, just as I had consequences for mine. She got even angrier, saying that I am going way too far with this. She even said I\u2019m worse now than I ever was when I was \u201c20 and immature\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nHow can I explain how serious this whole situation is? I know adulting is hard for everyone but I can see it in her eyes, she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have to fight for EVERYTHING.

Moreover, saying that she could lose her baby due to the stress of the lawsuit is a bit exaggerated.\n\nThe school is 100% responsible for the loss of information and should have a plan to recover it. You're definitely not the only affected student; there could be hundreds or even thousands.\n\nYour lawsuit isn't about revenge or money; it's about the information you need, and they refused to provide alternatives. Don't pay attention to your 'friend'; this persons doesn't know your entire story and clearly doesn't care about your future or well-being.\n\nDo what's best for you, OP. Keep working hard, and I hope you can continue with your studies", "NTA\n\nThis has nothing to do with the pregnant woman and everything to do with the school and the school district.  The pregnant woman will need to do work, of course, but that's her job.  You need this to move forward, it was their responsibility to keep your information safe, now they need to do their job to rectify the situation.  You are doing nothing to the pregnant woman except asking her to do her job.", "NTA\n\nWhat does her pregnancy have to do with anything. You aren't suing her, you are suing the school, she just happena to work there. If she's still able to do her job then that includes dealing with lawsuits etc.", "INFO: Why would you be suing the individual high school? After this many years, the school doesn't have your transcripts, the district does. Mine were 20 years old and I had to go through the district and they had to physically pull a file from the basement to get them. It took awhile, but I got them. Also, as someone else said, your former college likely has them as well. \n\nThe principal should absolutely not have to be involved in this at all. Someone who makes a heck of a lot more at the district level should be handling it.", "how many times are you going to post a similar variation of this story??", ">The principal is pregnant with a child\n\n*(I'm sorry LOL, but am I the only one who got stuck on this? I'm glad it's a child as opposed to . . . a pinecone? A raccoon?)* \n\nHer pregnancy has nothing to do with you or the case. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nFirst things first. Your high school transcripts will continue to be needed/important down the road. School, jobs, everything. You will likely need them and need proof of grades/graduation to do most of anything out there, so keep working toward getting them. \n\nSecond, the issue at hand of your transcripts being unavailable is not the pregnant principal's fault I'm assuming. It is not like SHE herself did something specific to them, right? Assuming not, her involvement SHOULD have been limited to, \"we tried to get his transcripts. We cannot, I forwarded his concern to XYZ.\" It's not like she can just magically fix whatever was wrong with them. \n\nThird: The pregnant lady involvement has only gotten to this point because she decided to be rude about working with you to come to a realistic solution. Everyone screws up, especially when they are 20. Her lack of willingness to work with you based off who you were 5 years prior is poor character and decision making on her part. She herself elevated her Involvement in this, you did nothing wrong. She could have handled this much better than \"sorry, tough luck.\" like WTH are you supposed to do at that point, just go on with you life never getting a copy of your transcripts? \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong. You made mistakes in the past, owned up to them, and are working toward bettering yourself. And she (and the school) as individuals involved in the education field should respect that and help you out. Not just tell you tough luck and move on.", "INFO\n\nThis would be a suit against the entire school district. And would have very little to do with the pregnant principal. This overall makes very little sense - why is the principal even a concern?", "Lots of holes, OP not responding, gut says fake.", ">I\u2019m effectively suing a pregnant woman\n\nINFO: Are you suing the principal personally or in her role as principal? And, if it's personal, why?", "Stop talking to employees of a school you are suing.  How on earth did your lawyer not explain this to you? You are going to say the wrong thing and screw your life up all over again. Stop talking to people who work at the school. All of them.  Stop.  \n\nNTA, unless you keep talking to her.", "Before I can make a judgment I need evidence that this isn\u2019t AI, because it sure reads like it. \n\nI\u2019m also trying to figure how in the hell you end up getting cease and desist letters from colleges.", "NTA\n\nImagine being pregnant and suddenly you can do whatever you want because you are holy and untouchable...\n\nYou didn't ipregnate her.", "If this is real, YTA. If it\u2019s not, YTA. Sounds like a horribly written victim fantasy and at best it\u2019s main character syndrome where you\u2019ve done so much to better yourself but are still a total jerk. \n\nFrankly I don\u2019t understand any reference to the friend or pregnancy from this story. You want to sue a school for a HS transcript, that a friend works at and the principle (another person presumably) is pregnant? Schools get sued, it\u2019s not wholly on the principal to deal with that and infantilizing someone because they\u2019re pregnant is just bizarre. Your friend would have nothing to do with this unless they\u2019re somehow related to record retrieval. \n\nLast nite, if you spent so much time obsessively applying to colleges, why don\u2019t you have a record of your transcript? Again, whole thing screams fake and attention seeking IMO.", "how, is she also the lawyer ? nta, pregnant is not an excuse in this case, + she will take maternaty leave soon anyway", "I imagine this has more to do with the lawsuit sounding frivolous and vindictive. If your transcripts are literally unavailable, and unable to be recovered, there is likely a less angry way for you to work to a solution with the college you\u2019re attempting to attend", "NTA stop letting your \u201cfriend\u201d guilt trip you. For legal reasons I would stop communicating with anyone at the school. Let lawyers do their thing.", "NTA. \n\nThey can work with you, or not. If you have a strong case then go with it. I\u2019m not sure why they won\u2019t work with you through it, but I\u2019m also not sure why it\u2019d be your problem to help her navigate pregnancy. If this is stressful enough to cause genuine worry about the health of her baby then the school needs to do a better job of protecting their employees. \n\n\nAlso ditch your friend. Unless there\u2019s something huge missing here they have big weirdo energy.", "Info.  How can you afford to sue?", "NTA, but you may not have to go through with a lawsuit. Do you still have your diploma? I went back to community college as an adult, and given the amount of time that had passed, my transcripts would've been a pain in the ass to get. When I contacted the community college I would be attending, they accepted a copy of my diploma and that was all they needed. Try contacting your college admissions office and explaining the situation, see if there's any solutions they might have.", "NTA. Absolutely not. You are not suing a pregnant woman. You are suing an institution that is represented by an employee who is evidently considered fit to work by her employer. If she were not capable of doing her job while pregnant, then she would be on maternity leave. \n\nIndeed, to refrain from suing on the basis of her pregnancy is disrespectful and antifeminist, because it implies that she is not fully capable of doing the job she is trusted and paid to do.", "NTA.   \nAs you say, they should accept the consequences of screwing up.", "You're not suing a pregnant woman, you're suing a school district.  They are required to furnish your transcripts and I'm sure there are a bunch of others who are stuck also because they can't get their transcripts.  NTA at all.  The principal may not get involved in it at all.  It sounds like something the IT department, the superintendent, and their lawyers will handle.  Not sure though.", "Nta\n\n\nHer pregnancy isn't your concern.", "Nta", "YTA for overreacting. You seem to go from 0 to 100 in overreacting. \n\nYou\u2019ve been accepted to Community College. Do they need your grades from H.S.?\n\nIn any case, the School District - not the individual school - is responsible to make it right.  The superintendent should draft a letter on letterhead, stating that you graduated. \n\nCommunity College probably doesn\u2019t need your GPA or transcript.  And a 4 year college will care about your CC grades not your H.S. transcript. \n\nIf that letter isn\u2019t sufficient, then sit for the GED.", "INFO\n\n> Then when the high school we went to fucks up and almost ruins my future, all they say is \u201coops sorry\u201d.\n\n**_After_** you graduated?\n\nP sure no public school *owes* you transcripts.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The people dealing with the lawsuit at the school districts end are going to be people who's specific job description involves dealing with lawsuits, and whatever higher ups made the decision that they are not going to do anything about recovering the encrypted records.\n\nEdit: Even if the principal was directly involved in this lawsuit you're still NTA. You need those records. Someday her unborn child will probably need records, I'm sure if they ran into a similar situation getting them their mother would totally encourage them to sue. But I just wanted to point out why your friend's take is irrational and absurd.", "NTA", "NTA this could ruin your whole life potentially you should sue", "NTA. Your friend is honestly very silly about their way of understanding this. First of all, you\u2019re not suing the principal. You\u2019re suing the school district.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t explain anything else any further to your friend because she has essentially chosen a side and does not see you as a victim. I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t the only person who was effected by their fuck up and it\u2019s hindering you from progressing. She\u2019s immature to think you should just move on from this without fighting for something you deserve. \n\nAlso, guilting you into feeling like you could possibly cause harm to a baby because of this is low AF. Pregnant women have dealt with stress for literal centuries, sometimes it effects the baby negatively, sometimes it does not. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to the woman and their doctor to decide if they need to take a step back due to stress.

Obviously NTA. Your backstory as well as who the specific principal of the high school currently is are both irrelevant here - you need your transcript for a legitimate reason (college admissions), and your high school isn't giving it to you or doing anything to remedy this, forcing you to persue a lawsuit to resolve that.", "Sue the baby too", "In many places there is only one high school in the district.", "Pregnant with ransomware.", "I graduated from college years ago, and I have never  been asked for my transcripts except when I applied for grad school.
