All you are doing is fostering resentment between your kids and exerting your dominance through control of the bank. That may work for awhile, but as soon as your son has financial independence I doubt he\u2019ll have a good relationship with you and your family. Maybe you\u2019re okay with that.", "YTA. Be prepared to lose your son forever over something absolutely ridiculous.", "YTA. Did you see your son naked or something and now have to assert your dominance somehow? Your insecurity is showing. Is this how your father treated you? Did it make you feel good?", "It doesn't sound like there were any conditions regarding attending his brothers graduations when his trip was booked.\n\nIf this is the case then YTA.\nYou can't just go moving the goalposts & putting conditions on things retrospectively to blackmail him into doing what you want.", "ESH I'm really torn on this one. I can see that you are frustrated that he doesn't want to be a part of a family event. And your son is being a selfish jerk for not wanting to go to the graduations, which I'm sure his siblings are excited to have him at.\n\nYou are showing him that if he is unwilling to give to the family, in the form of his attendance to support his siblings, he can't expect to get from his family by you paying for a trip that's important to him. I totally see the logic here. Why should he benefit from his family when he doesn't want to be there for other members of the family?\n\nHowever, your son arrived at this decision because the importance of family has not been reinforced by you and his mother in the past. Now you want to enforce this in the most damaging way possible. \n\nYou went straight to the nuclear option, without trying other methods of persuasion, and now you've backed yourself into a corner. If you change your mind you'll look weak and if your son does attend under this threat he will be there grudgingly at best and always resent you for being so heavy handed. If he doesn't attend and you keep him from going on the trip he will  blame you, not his own actions, and likely never forgive you, causing permanent damage to your relationship.\n\nIf your son does not want to voluntarily attend because he loves and wants to be supportive of his siblings you have a bigger problem if he's so disconnected from your family. Denying the class trip won't fix that, it would just force his physical presence. \n\nYou could try to frame this as a teaching moment to your son and explain that if you want to experience the benefits of being a part of a family you have to nurture the relationships by being supportive of one another. You could say the disappointment you would feel not going on your trip would reflect the disappointment of your siblings, etc., etc. and you were trying to show that to him. That's a long shot, though, and I don't see how you're going to turn this into a positive.", "YTA. FFS.

A lot of comments are talking about how meaningless elementary graduations are and y\u2019all are weird. Yea, they\u2019re silly showcases of what we deem small accomplishments, but these are HUGE milestones for those kids. They tend to dress up because they did a thing! Its the end of a chapter and the beginning of another in their short lifespans. And it\u2019s so exciting to them and to their parents because their tiny person has done a thing! It\u2019s may be stupid to you (general you, not OP), but adults still go to show support. That\u2019s the point. Not for you to have fun. These children aren\u2019t putting on a Broadway production. I get that it\u2019s boring for your older son, but you really could\u2019ve explained why his presence would be appreciated as a show of family support instead of forcing him. And taking away his trip will only make him more resentful. I\u2019m including your older son as an AH because he\u2019s old enough to know that sometimes you have to attend things you think are \u201clame\u201d.

Just because you think that your 18 year old should be close to his younger half siblings doesn't mean he will be and by attaching a monetary award (vacation) to a forced closeness, you are just ensuring resentment. There are so many ways to approach a situation and you chose to threaten a financial punishment, knowing that neither he nor his mother can pay for the trip. Your responses all read as \"I pay for him so he is mine to control\" which tells me that you lead your family with sticks and fear, rather than love and compassion. And to your point of how many teenagers go no contact, I can tell you more way more than what you think, and teenagers turn into adults who go no contact with aging, lonely, bitter parents.", "This is the dumbest ultimatum I have heard in a long time.
