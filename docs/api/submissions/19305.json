All you are doing is fostering resentment between your kids and exerting your dominance through control of the bank. That may work for awhile, but as soon as your son has financial independence I doubt he\u2019ll have a good relationship with you and your family. Maybe you\u2019re okay with that.", "YTA. Be prepared to lose your son forever over something absolutely ridiculous.", "YTA. Did you see your son naked or something and now have to assert your dominance somehow? Your insecurity is showing. Is this how your father treated you? Did it make you feel good?", "It doesn't sound like there were any conditions regarding attending his brothers graduations when his trip was booked.\n\nIf this is the case then YTA.\nYou can't just go moving the goalposts & putting conditions on things retrospectively to blackmail him into doing what you want.", "ESH I'm really torn on this one. I can see that you are frustrated that he doesn't want to be a part of a family event. And your son is being a selfish jerk for not wanting to go to the graduations, which I'm sure his siblings are excited to have him at.\n\nYou are showing him that if he is unwilling to give to the family, in the form of his attendance to support his siblings, he can't expect to get from his family by you paying for a trip that's important to him. I totally see the logic here. Why should he benefit from his family when he doesn't want to be there for other members of the family?\n\nHowever, your son arrived at this decision because the importance of family has not been reinforced by you and his mother in the past. Now you want to enforce this in the most damaging way possible. \n\nYou went straight to the nuclear option, without trying other methods of persuasion, and now you've backed yourself into a corner. If you change your mind you'll look weak and if your son does attend under this threat he will be there grudgingly at best and always resent you for being so heavy handed. If he doesn't attend and you keep him from going on the trip he will  blame you, not his own actions, and likely never forgive you, causing permanent damage to your relationship.\n\nIf your son does not want to voluntarily attend because he loves and wants to be supportive of his siblings you have a bigger problem if he's so disconnected from your family. Denying the class trip won't fix that, it would just force his physical presence. \n\nYou could try to frame this as a teaching moment to your son and explain that if you want to experience the benefits of being a part of a family you have to nurture the relationships by being supportive of one another. You could say the disappointment you would feel not going on your trip would reflect the disappointment of your siblings, etc., etc. and you were trying to show that to him. That's a long shot, though, and I don't see how you're going to turn this into a positive.", "YTA. FFS.

It\u2019s may be stupid to you (general you, not OP), but adults still go to show support. That\u2019s the point. Not for you to have fun. These children aren\u2019t putting on a Broadway production. I get that it\u2019s boring for your older son, but you really could\u2019ve explained why his presence would be appreciated as a show of family support instead of forcing him.

There are so many ways to approach a situation and you chose to threaten a financial punishment, knowing that neither he nor his mother can pay for the trip. Your responses all read as \"I pay for him so he is mine to control\" which tells me that you lead your family with sticks and fear, rather than love and compassion. And to your point of how many teenagers go no contact, I can tell you more way more than what you think, and teenagers turn into adults who go no contact with aging, lonely, bitter parents.", "This is the dumbest ultimatum I have heard in a long time.

Either A. he's going to go and be miserable and possibly make everyone else miserable or B. he's not gonna go, OP will cancel the trip and Liam will resent OP for years and their relationship will be strained.\n\nThe fact that Liam simply walked away at news like this, tells me that he half expected this temper tantrum that OP is throwing and that this is a typical reaction from OP. Based on that and his comments about his ex, Liam's mother, it seems to me that he prioritizes his new girlfriend/wife/relationship and their kids over Liam. \n\nI'd even go as far as to speculate that maybe, OP left Liam's mom for the mother of the younger boys, maybe even cheated on Liam's mom with her.

Kids need boundaries, consistency, consequences (both positive and negative), and a loving but firm parental figure. \n\nYou\u2019re trying to teach your kid the importance of family, meeting expectations, and how to not be a selfish person. \n\nWhat you\u2019re asking is for your son to contribute to the family by *caring* and *showing up.* That\u2019s not a huge ask. \n\nHe is obviously excited about graduating. It\u2019s odd that he can\u2019t understand (or sad because he doesn\u2019t care) but they are excited about their little graduations too. \n\nHe wants people at his graduation that he loves. How can he not see that this is important to your smaller kids too? He sounds a tiny bit entitled and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re out of bounds having higher expectations of your child. \n\nI wish you had made him come back and had a talk about what all had just happened and how to handle stuff like that in the future. \n\nI think you should consider sitting down with him and modeling how to communicate effectively when he\u2019s angry or frustrated. The way that he coped with his frustration was to walk away from you mid conversation, \u201ctattle\u201d on you to your ex who should be a supportive coparent, and stonewall you after. That\u2019s not healthy. You\u2019ve got to help him grow some more or he\u2019s going to really struggle to communicate at work and in relationships. \n\nI think you should ask him to come over. Let him know that you both may have gotten a little too heated. That you want to talk to him and work through this because you love him. Reach out to him again. I know you can fix this.", "Imo NTA. What\u2019s the big deal with an 18 year old attending an elementary or preschool graduation? I went to my sister\u2019s snd little cousin\u2019s preschool graduations because it\u2019s a family compromise and also I love them and see no problem with attending. Idk about in the US but it is quite common where I\u2019m from for the whole family to go to these kind of events snd I think your reaction is valid.", "YTA, no graduation actually matters other than high school and college. Elementary school graduations are insufferable and a total waste of time. I\u2019ve never even seen a preschool graduation but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same. You\u2019d really take away a senior trip, something I\u2019m sure he\u2019s looking forward to, over something so petty? You sound like an insufferable asshole of a father. Let me speak from experience. I was supposed to go on a week long senior trip to Aruba after high school with my friends. My passport didn\u2019t come in time and I wasn\u2019t able to go. I cried myself to sleep every night that week because all my friends were on an island and I was stuck at home feeling lonely all day. I can\u2019t say your son will be that impacted, but this could be a serious relationship ending mistake if you go through with it. This is not a \u201clittle school trip\u201d, it\u2019s essentially a last hurrah before he goes off to college and doesn\u2019t see his friend again. Have fun when your son goes non-contact on your controlling ass.", "Correction\u2026 you have one kid graduating.  YTA", "And its a very new thing. My nieces didn't go theirs because they themselves thought it was stupid and asked my sister to not make them do it. They would rather go camping and huckleberry picking.

I don't understand the number of people saying these events don't matter and the younger kids won't care if he goes and shouldn't go to his grad cause it will be long. I'm 14 year's older than my sister, she was 5 when my high school grad happened and she sat through the whole thing happy as anything to be part of a big moment for me. She's fourteen now, I'm 29, and graduating from grade 8 (Middle school) into high school. I suffer from super bad anxiety that keeps me from leaving the house some days but you better believe I'm going to be there proud as hell.", "He should not be making any more kids", ">there are a few things we do in healthy groups, family included\n\nThat's not what OP is asking, though. He's not asking if he's an A for asking his son to attend a children's graduation. He's asking if he's the A for holding an event important to his son hostage in order to make him go. I think there's a significant difference between the two. If the children have a good relationship, I think it would be a good idea, but if they don't have a good one, then forcing a relationship by holding a trip hostage is *not* the way to do it. All that's going to happen is that the oldest *will* resent his father and might possibly hold a grudge against the younger sibling. \n\nIf he doesn't want to go, and that somehow ruins the brothers relationship, then that'll be something that the brothers will have to deal with on their own.  \n\n\nThis issue isn't about the family event, it's what OP is doing to make the matter worse.", "I have a child. And I think dad is an ah. \n\nThe issue, for me, is not the request of participation. It\u2019s that the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. The trip was a done deal. Now dad is mad at the son and trying to punish him. Find another consequence. This is simply punitive. Punitive punishments are handed out in bouts of anger and attempts at control. \n\nShould the son go? Yes. Do we know the family dynamic that brought him to the point of not wanting to attend? No. Should he be more grateful and suck it up for what dad wants? Probably. But taking away the trip makes dad an ah. \n\nActually, esh.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is saying the request for him to attend is unreasonable, it\u2019s the way OP chose to respond to him that is unreasonable. Obviously not many 18 yrs old senior is just dying to go to kid\u2019s graduation. \n\nOk let\u2019s say 18 yrs old son attend his siblings graduations and then go on his trip, you think he\u2019s ever coming back to attend any family events after that once he is out of the house/college? I know I wouldn\u2019t. There goes that \u2018closeness\u2019 and family bonding OP so desperately wanting to foster. There was another way for OP to approach this but using the stick was easier for him. It\u2019s his money and he is using it to browbeat his son into submission rather than talking to him. Then he\u2019ll wonder why his son doesn\u2019t respect him. \n\nYour kids do remember your shitty parenting and will act accordingly once they\u2019re far enough away from you.", "for real, just watched the latest vanderpump rules reunion and I\u2019ve been thirsty for drama all night, it\u2019s wonderful", "Why not turn this around? How stubborn is the son to walk away from a trip worth thousands for a 2-hour activity for a sibling?", "That\u2019s asking wayyyy too much. Clearly the only reasonable solution is for the son to go no contact because he might not get his free trip to the Bahamas. \n/s", "University is pretty cool because you get to wear robes. Never watched one though, probably less fun if you're not pretending you're a wizard.", "We're they from a different mom who is hated by the dad?", "For all we know there are much deeper issues here with the half siblings and whether or not Liam feels included in dads new family and circumstances around the divorce and how that impacted Liam. OP doesn\u2019t exactly sound like he has a flourishing coparenting relationship with Liam\u2019s mom. Maybe Liam is being a shitty teen, maybe it\u2019s deeper family dynamics with how dad treats Liam compared to his younger kids. They likely should have been in family therapy a long time ago.", "Yeah I'm down with celebrating 13 years of accomplishment. It's the true end of an era. Any \"graduation\" ceremony before that is stupid", "And then he will blame the ex wife for not paying for it. I hope he loses all of his money.", "Also if the teen is graduating high school, this doesn't sound like a \"school trip\" in the sense of the school organising it. This sounds more like what in my country is called Schoolies week, where school leavers organise a trip somewhere to celebrate. It's like the moment between the ending of their childhood education and the beginning of having to figure out an adult life. A way bigger transition than moving from one school grade to another.", "It speaks volumes though that the son is willing to miss the trip to the Bahamas rather than go to the graduations, which is a direct indication there's serious bad blood between this kid and all the other family. Therefore, I'm inclined to believe that OP is a major a-hole to his kid."]}
