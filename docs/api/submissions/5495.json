I even ordered a krumkake iron (which finally came, we've been snowed in for over a week now). I'm seriously considering not even *trying* to use it. I'm just dreading being told that I \"don't have to do this\", when yes, I *do* want to do this.

I just don't want to try to balance handling hot pans and hotter irons and frying oil and cooling racks with a toddler running around in the kitchen incessantly touching *everything*... or a toddler throwing hours of screaming fits in the Baby Corral every time I pick up the rolling pin.

Same thing with my dad, who ostensibly comes up to watch our daughter, but is getting more and more needy and childlike himself and seems to find something to go sulk about whenever I actually need him to watch the kid.

The actual baking takes like 1-2 days if I can devote myself to it 100%, and the only ingredients I had to go actually buy this year (and not dig out of the pantry) we're ground ginger and heavy whipping cream.", "This! It sounds like OP\u2019s husband also has things he wants to do (his projects that OP thinks aren\u2019t important just because it\u2019s cold for some reason) but OP has decided her cookies take priority and he should give up two days of his time being a full time single parent to help her.

Maybe a neighbor could watch your child for a couple hours and you could watch their child another time when they need help? Or, if you know any neighborhood teenagers, my first babysitting job was one where I watched the children while their parents were working from home.

Sounds like it was a misunderstanding with your husband too and he was being protective, so maybe NAH save your mum how doesn't want to lend you her krumkake iron to make your Grandma happy.", "How many hours are you in the kitchen", "OK, let's make it fair, then.  She wants a whole day away from kiddo to do what she wants.  In exchange, is she offering him a whole day away from kiddo to do what HE wants?  Or is it your opinion that only the mom deserves time to do what she wants?", "Right.  She wants him to watch the kid a whole day so she can do a project that only she cares about.  If they're equally responsible, then wouldn't it have been right to offer (in return) to watch kiddo for a whole day at a later time, so he could do something he cares about?  Or is the \"equally responsible\" thing only valid when it helps mom do something she enjoys?", "I really wish those were options, but we live in pretty much bumfuck rural nowhere and never got time to get to know more than a few of our neighbors - and the only neighbor who is close enough to watch the kiddo is on the other side of the state right now.", "That is in fact what the post says :)", "You have any thoughts on a mother who doesn't want to hang out with her kid?  The way the OP reads, she wants time away from kiddo.  Fine.  Is she offering (in return) for the father to also have time away from kiddo?  Or is this a one-way deal where she gets to relax and he just has to suck it up?", "Ok, I can see lots of people have the opinion that the dad should help, and that's fair.  But seeing this monster project is a project that only mom cares about, she's doing it purely for herself.  So keeping that in mind, did she offer to watch kiddo all day (a later day) in exchange for father doing so?  After all, if both parents must split childcare equally, then her insisting on him giving up a whole day in exchange for nothing doesn't feel quite right.\n\nBefore I have a million people downvote me, to explain where I'm coming from.  My own two kids were born about a year apart.  When my wife was pregnant with number two, she loudly proclaimed (and she told everyone who would listen) that she never should have  had children.  Not even one.  That she realized (too late) that she wasn't cut out to be a mom.  Hokey Dokey.  So I was working full-time, she was a SAH mom.  I didn't want her to feel too put-upon.  So I took over all the  cooking, cleaning, the bulk of the childcare (when I was home).  She still wasn't happy, because she had to watch the kids while I was at work.  So at first, we put the kids in daycare while I was at work and she was at home watching soap operas.  But she didn't feel like bothering to take the kids to daycare or pick them up.  And I couldn't always do that, as I was often away on business.  So I hired two full-time nannies.  We had a nanny in the house to watch the kids every day Sunday through Saturday.  My wife didn't want to do anything, and her father was encouraging her to sit on her ass all day every day as that's the way it should be.  \n\nEventually, she felt that doing nothing all day was way too stressful for her, so she  abandoned me and the kids to go live with her parents about 400 miles away.  She didn't bother to ever call me or call the kids or in any way check on us to make sure we were still alive.  I didn't feel it was right to have the kids raised by nannies, so I quit my job and lived off my savings for a year so I could be a single dad raising two kids in diapers.    \n\nWatching a screaming toddler is a chore.  I get it.  It would be nice to pass that off to hubby so you can bake cookies all day.  But in return, does hubby get a day away from screaming toddler to do his thing?  Fair is fair.  And that's not the way I read the OP.  To me, it seems she is making up an important project that only she cares about in a way to shirk her duties.\n\nBut I freely admit my view could be a bit biased based on my own experience.  The mother of my children wanted NOTHING to do with them until I filed for divorce.  As soon as I filed for divorce, her attorney told her how much they could rape me for child support if she took the kids that she didn't love.  And just like magic...all of a sudden the kids were the most important part of her life.", "Soooooo... What's your favourite cookie that uses cardamom? I like the flavour so I'm intrigued.", "Oh no, not ONE DAY of him watching his kids. How will he go on.", "Overwhelmed watching his own kids? Come on... he's a man, not a child.", "Yeah, he deadass didn't realize it was about my grandma until just a little bit ago. The krumkake iron arrived, and it's broken. And now that I told my mom that (after she both refused to let me borrow hers *and* balked last week at spending an extra $20 to get me a cheap new one of my own that would arrive before Christmas) the one I ordered is broken, suddenly she's all sweetness and spare time to bake up a batch or three of them.", "If you're keeping score in a relationship, that's super toxic. Unless OP states different, I'm sure they both get to do what they want to do. Actually, I think OP doesn't get to do as much as husband because the way his attitude is about baking some dang cookies. His attitude screams volumes.", "You don\u2019t know what she offered but it\u2019s laughable if you think that as a woman, she\u2019s not doing the majority of the childcare.", "Welp, must've missed that part!", "OP literally states he has his own errands he wants to do and such. So I'm sure he gets the time alone he needs to accomplish them. Parents are still allowed to have hobbies. And keeping score is a toxic trait to have in relationships.", "He gets pretty much all the time to do his projects, *the rest of the year*. \n\nAlso, I'm so sorry you got hurt like that. That sucks.", "OP wants husband to watch the kids for 2 days straight and give up the time he is spending on his own projects. \n\nWhy are her baking projects more important than whatever projects he\u2019s working on? \n\nHe should watch his kids as a father, but she\u2019s unreasonable for asking for 2 full days off from watching the kids who are also hers.", "Lol yes. I'm a parent and get overwhelmed that's normal. Especially if one parent is devoting days to baking and already on edge. It's one thing for a few hours but days and since Halloween? Come on now that's a lot especially with toddler(s).", ">Yeah, he deadass didn't realize it was about my grandma until just a little bit ago. \n\nHas he pulled his head out of his ass and apologized for how he was acting?", "Well, that throws a different spin on it.  He should be willing to help in that case.  And thank you for your kind comment.  The worst part about what I went through is now I pay money every month so that my kids can be raised by a woman who doesn't even love them...", "Yes and yes.", "Your husband is in for a rude awakening.

Don\u2019t come over if he isn\u2019t going to help.", "Probably a tie between krumkake and fattingman, but I've only ever had those once that I remember, and it was the last year that grandma actually did any cookies.", "\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 yes cause that's what's happening here. If this was a man wanting to do something women would tear him apart for it but it's mommy so obviously she's on the right\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "That's literally what it is. She wants one day alone to do a thing and he can't handle it.", "No it isn't lol. For starters if she's been in \"people pleasing mode\" since Halloween then it's been going off and on on for a minute and she says herself it'll take at least a couple days. Either way if this was a man everyone would be flipping out over his selfishness.", "NTA You\u2019re never the asshole for asking the Dad to parent his child.", "NTA but this is a relationship problem with your husband (and boundary problem with your dad, but that\u2019s a far second). Your husband should be your partner not whatever is going on, full stop.\n\nAlso you should probably stop referring to baking cookies as your little \u201cpeople pleasing habit\u201d. That\u2019s pretty awful on a lot of levels. And if you\u2019re diminishing your work, why would anyone else respect it?", "YTA why can't you make a small batch for just grandma ?\n\nLeave all the extras nobody wants the Cookies."]}
