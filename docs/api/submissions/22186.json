I am a new mom to twin boys (they are 7months). They are beautiful and they're my everything, but I've long been needing a bit of a break and to catch up with my mom who lives out of state. I was set to leave with my younger sister helping me pack and drive. My husband agreed that he was happy to look after the babies and that I should have a good time there. We agreed that I'd stay over the weekend.\n\nI'm enjoying catching up, things are going well, when I get a text from my husband saying he's thinking of getting a sitter. I'm a new mom like I said. I really do not want my boys to have a sitter so soon. It might be silly but I'm sticking to my guns, so I called my husband and told him under no circumstances are we having a stranger look after our kids. It's only 2 days and it's not as if he has to work. He told me his head hurts 'so bad'.\n\nWell, yeah, mine does too after enough wiping diapers and listening to them scream but you don't see me complaining! We argued for a bit but I think I got my point across and he relented. I had a great time at my mom's and when I got home everything was fine. Babies sleeping peacefully, house looking beautiful. Told ya so. Ran to my hubs and gave him a big kiss. But he was in a funk. His head's killing him, he wants to sleep. He told me it was so frustrating that I didn't let him get a sitter or a nanny to help him. \n\nThe way I look at it, I just gave him a nice reality check into what it's like being the mother. I love my job but it's not easy. I don't think I was the asshole leaving him with the babies. He did a good job, it's just not an easy job no matter which way you look at it. But he's been moody and thinks I showed my selfish side.

He still pushed through it.\n\nIt sound like you have a good support system and from your post your husband doesn\u2019t sound like that kind of man who makes his wife take on all the burdens. \n\nYou come across like you love to play martyr to me.

He develops a migraine (a condition which would impact his ability to care for children) so he just wants help. His wife forces him to not get help for vague reasons. And yet he is T A?\n\nI\u2019m going with YTA. Why would you refuse to allow your sick partner help watching the kids? Especially since you get help from your sister often. There is no good reason to have prevented a sitter besides your desire to make your husband miserable.", "YTA , after reading your comments that you have your sister helping you out a lot, your husband is at work for long hours but does help you out as a decent father should and that he's now currently lying down in a dark room covering his ears for all appearances suffering a migraine. That's a bit more than a \"headache\" that's debilitating level of pain that even my own mother of 4 would get myself as the oldest or a neighbour to keep an eye on the kids if Dad wasn't home.\n\nYou even admit in your comments you did this on purpose to \"prove he could do it\" but disregard the fact you have potential support when under the weather via your sister and husband, then you double down and refuse him support when feeling under the weather\n\nYou then also admitted he did a good job, the house was tidy etc. I have to ask , why do you hate your husband? Why did you marry and procreate with somebody who you seem to derive such pleasure in having to prove yourself better than? \n\nHe's right, you have certainly shown him a side of your personality that is quite frankly disgusting, you would rather compete than support and he won't forget that. In your bizarre efforts to show him how good you are I think you just created your own countdown.", "Going to go against the grain and say YTA.\n\nNot for expecting him to watch the babies, that\u2019s a given. Nor for saying no to the sitter, but rather your reason as to saying no and your attitude.\n\nFrom this entire post it seems to me like you wanted him to suffer as much as you\u2019ve suffered over the past few months. And especially the told ya after he took care of them without the sitters, just seems condescending. \n\nBased off of your comments, it seems like the sitter wasn\u2019t going to be there to relieve him of every duty, just to allow them to rest before he takes back over. Most likely similar to how your sister regularly helps you. \n\nUnless you didn\u2019t include some information, it seems like you just wanted him to suffer because you had.\n\nAs for those saying it\u2019s his first time parenting, OP already stated that he helps her when he gets home from work.", "Colossal YTA", "YTA you said usually it\u2019s you and your sister looking after the twins with husband helping once he\u2019s finished work.

How is that fair?", "[removed]", "YTA. \n\nIf you\u2019re suffering from terrible migraines trying to deal with the kids, nobody would blame you if you asked for help. The same is true for your husband. This mentality of \u201cif I could gut it out, so must you\u201d isn\u2019t good.\n\nI also think you\u2019re mistakenly assuming that he got a really bad headache because of dealing with the kids. He might\u2019ve just happened to suffer a really bad headache at that time and that\u2019s gonna affect anyone\u2019s capacity to do work. Its not wrong to ask for help in that situation. If its shown that his headaches are caused by him caring for the kids then yeah, he might need to learn to deal with that in the future because as a parent he has a responsibility. But you automatically assumed the worst.\n\nSimilarly, you assumed that his headache is as bad as yours and since you were able to deal with it so he must too. There\u2019s no point of comparison, you don\u2019t know how bad his headache was. He could just be overly dramatic or he be suffering a full on terrible delibitating migrane. Again, instead of giving him the benefit of the doubt you straight away assumed the worst.", "As someone who\u2019s suffered from migraines my whole life (they\u2019re mostly better now but when i was a kid i would get them more often and nothing would help and i\u2019d literally be puking my guts out from the pain of the migraine) I have to sympathize with him, though I don\u2019t know how serious his headache was. \n\nWhen other people hear \u201cheadache\u201d I think they are talking about something very mild but when I think \u201cheadache\u201d I think of something that can potentially have me in agonizing pain all day with no end in sight if I don\u2019t nip it in the bud. So it would really piss me off if someone told me my headache was no big deal because nobody else is in my body experiencing my pain but me. \n\nBUT, again idk how serious his headache was but I just generally think it\u2019s not a good idea to tell people to suck it up with their pain because you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re experiencing or if they HAVE been sucking it up but it\u2019s becoming unbearable.\n\nDon\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t have let him get a little help if it was a serious migraine, especially if he stayed in the house with the help and it\u2019s not like he was asking you to cut your trip early. Sounds kinda like you just wanted to prove a point to him or something which doesn\u2019t seem super healthy because if you want him to appreciate all you do there are better ways to go about it like talking.", "\"Headache is what he meant.

Why, for him, it's \"not like he has to work\" while for you it's you heroically watching your children, with the help of your husband, and the help of your sister, making it THREE adults watching two children, rather than your husband who had to watch them on his own? Why do you get credit for watching them all the time but the other two people don't?  \nIn a comment you said: I wasn't trying to be mean at all, I was just saying \"See, I knew you could do it!\"\n\nYour husband pushed through pain and discomfort, took care of two seven month year old siblings for a weekend, everything was neat and done and taken care of, and with \"Told ya so\" you implied that you KNEW it would be because your husband is a great husband, putting the kids above his own wellbeing if you make him.

Normally you wouldn\u2019t hire a babysitter just because you have a headache or a cold or feeling a bit trash. That is not an option for most people. You just manage. \n\nThen there is the question how unwell he really was. Was he capable of taking care of the kids? Was it just uncomforable for him or was it dangerous/irresponsible for him to have the kids?

Dealing with two 7 month olds while having a migraine sounds horrible, like the man could be puking over the toilet and unable to see clearly or open his eyes but sure, he\u2019s fit to look after the babies! This man is an equal partner who does his fair share and supports you, you decided to be unsupportive of him. If you don\u2019t care about him feeling like he\u2019s dying then consider that your babies could have been injured or hurt because daddy wasn\u2019t capable of handling them while his head was splitting open.

Even an hour or so of lying on the dark and quiet could have helped.", "I won't say YTA, but you're not NTA either. You commented that parents don't get days off when you're literally taking days off to visit your mom. Nothing wrong with it, but you aren't holding yourself to the same accountability that you hold him to. He works, comes home and does his father duty, and doesn't hold that over your head. Being a SAHP is definitely a full-time job, but that doesn't discredit that he also has a full-time job. You are making it seem like him going to work is a daily escape from responsibility. That's what I do find fair with your sentiment. \n\nAlso, knowing and expressing that you aren't up for a task that you previously thought you were isn't a bad thing. He felt comfortable enough to share his vulnerability as a possibly ill-equipped parent, and your response can be summarized as \"suck it up.\" I do get the stranger thing because my partner has expressed a similar feeling on the subject, so I'll acknowledge merit to your reasoning. But there was most likely another option to satiate both sides. Another relative, friend, quick interview over FaceTime, neighbor, etc. But because you wanted him to feel your pain for some reason, you didn't open yourself to compromise. \n\nHonestly, I'm going to upgrade you to YTA because that one comment pushed one of my few buttons hard enough for me to type this long, stupid response. Lowkey, it's not that big of a deal, and I see your side, but I dislike when people would rather have others feel their pain instead of helping create a solution that is better for all.

Yes I have a amazing partner, who does nothing in the house (they work), and I dont let them!

Why is it like a firefighter, your always fighting what you can see, and preventing what you cant see.\n\nThe parent going to work at times miss so much, first words, first steps first day of school.

You used this to punish him for his lack of support. You decided that if you can cope with that, so should he, even if he does not have experience or if he is less capable to deal with this new situation ( think about depression, anxiety etc rather than time and effort).

I was set to leave with my younger sister helping me pack and drive. My husband agreed that he was happy to look after the babies and that I should have a good time there. We agreed that I'd stay over the weekend.\n\nI'm enjoying catching up, things are going well, when I get a text from my husband saying he's thinking of getting a sitter. I'm a new mom like I said. I really do not want my boys to have a sitter so soon. It might be silly but I'm sticking to my guns, so I called my husband and told him under no circumstances are we having a stranger look after our kids. It's only 2 days and it's not as if he has to work. He told me his head hurts 'so bad'.\n\nWell, yeah, mine does too after enough wiping diapers and listening to them scream but you don't see me complaining! We argued for a bit but I think I got my point across and he relented. I had a great time at my mom's and when I got home everything was fine. Babies sleeping peacefully, house looking beautiful. Told ya so. Ran to my hubs and gave him a big kiss. But he was in a funk. His head's killing him, he wants to sleep. He told me it was so frustrating that I didn't let him get a sitter or a nanny to help him. \n\nThe way I look at it, I just gave him a nice reality check into what it's like being the mother. I love my job but it's not easy. I don't think I was the asshole leaving him with the babies. He did a good job, it's just not an easy job no matter which way you look at it.

I don\u2019t get rest or any special treatment and I handle most things alone so yea maybe it\u2019s hard for me to empathize", "Ummm..you know that dark rooms help with other kinds of headaches right? And exhaustion? My sister is prone to migraines, I'm not. I get  headaches a lot due to a slipped disc in my cervical spine though. Dark room, cold cloth over the eyes, and quiet are at home remedies for most headaches....", ".... You are aware headaches when taking care of infants is normal, right? Put me in a room with a crying baby and I'll have one within 5 minutes. Still would have to take care of it if I was the parent though.. He wasnt running a fever or having a migraine. He probably had a tension headache from the crying, which is (sadly) part of the job.", "He said he had a headache are you a doctor.", "She wanted a break from the kids that is why what is so odd about that", "Once again you fail to answer a simple questions. And FYI you do boy need to be a doctor to recognize migraine symptoms. As you can see there are more of us who saw the same thing. And you know why? Cause we've had them.", "Again, if he was not planning to leave the house, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big of a deal as you think it is. He wasn\u2019t going to be like peace out, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, random stranger.\n\nIn fact, him being there with the sitter is one of the best ways to vet the person, get to know them, see how they interact, and start to form a trusted relationship for future babysitting needs. If it had gone well, OP could have been there the next time. Not the dangerous situation you\u2019re making it out to be.", "Have you seen the OP\u2019s other comments? It sounds very much like it was a migraine. \n\nHonestly, no one can even know for sure but would it kill OP to show a bit of empathy and not assume the worst?", "are you?", "Ok so fuck his feelings? He works all week and after work helping with the kids.  Is he not entitled to a break?   Honestly if I was him I would have just hired the help.  And as far as the wife she sure can too, it\u2019s a two way street.", "That\u2019s true. I just don\u2019t trust anyone with my kid or other ppl kids for that matter. I see way too many horror stories about thing\u2019s happening to kids because parents were just a little too trusting. Hell I\u2019ve been the kid of the too trusting parent so maybe I\u2019m biased about the whole thing.", "Nope and since OP said he hubby told  her it was a headache unlike you I did not diagnose it as a migraine", "Yep fuck  his feelings he can take a break next weekend last weekend was her turn.", "Well, crimes against children are overwhelmingly perpetrated by people the family knows. Obviously strangers can do bad things too, but numbers show that usually isn\u2019t the case.\n\nAnyways, thanks for the interesting convo. Have a good one!"]}
