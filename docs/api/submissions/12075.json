Its been confirmed by OP that this is what the wife is upset about:  \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p3hgm/aita\\_for\\_willing\\_my\\_estate\\_to\\_my\\_children\\_rather/jbvwhpn/?context=3", "We don't know that he didn't work with an attorney (although OP I do recommend doing this if you haven't) \n\nI don't think OP is short sighted. He's taking care of his children and ensuring other family members can't try and claim they have rights to the inheritance after he's gone.", "Op has already stated his brother will be executor if that were to happen. I\u2019m assuming he also has his brother being in charge of the inheritance until his kids become of age? (Am I right OP?)", "grandparents. Wife is getting all of the community property. By law he only had to leave her half of his share. Instead he is leaving all to her and making sure his family legacy stays in the family.", "OP can come back and explain how he set it up if he cares to do so.  But if he didn\u2019t do it properly and he dies while his kids are minors, he wife likely would have a support claim against the assets that could get very legally messy.", "He went to an attorney and set it up to ensure his children are the beneficiaries. He already stated that he lives in NM so certain claims aren't even allowed, and with the inheritance being from an uncle he was smart to designate it because otherwise cousins could potentially try to claim it upon his death. \n\nI understand your point, but you're assuming a lot of things that OP wouldn't know from an attorney. He set up his will with his brother as executor and worked with his lawyer, I'm sure they went over all of the specifics necessary. \n\nAnd for info, OP said in comments about the lawyer and his brother as executor."]}
