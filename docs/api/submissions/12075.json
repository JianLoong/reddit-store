These are her assets as much as they are his to do with what they choose. He is not \"giving her\" anything that she does not already own. By default 100 percent of community property goes directly to the surviving spouse after death. So that is literally the least he can do.

Many attorneys will advise against willing away any percentage of community property to anyone but a surviving spouse because it makes defending a will difficult and can be seen as \"disinheriting\" or \"alienating\" a spouse. There are a lot of rules with doing this and you are limited in how you can will away property. \n\nI would feel really differently if there was a big age gap or there were other children involved.
