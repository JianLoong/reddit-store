When you die without a will they have to decide how to apportion your money. The courts determine what is fair. NM has determined that individual or separate property passes partially to the spouse (1/4) and 3/4 to children. The intention of the law is to assume that you would want some of your inheritance to be passed to your spouse. \n\nSeparate property is a legal term. How each kind of law treats separate property is different.", "Yes, agreed 100%. Much of this I've explained/agreed to with more nuance in my other comments. I think it's most problematic that brother is the executor on the estate. This means that not only can the brother decide how the trust is set up, the terms of distributions, etc, he is also responsible for cataloging and distributing their marital assets to her if husband were to die. If he drags his feet or doesn't know what he is doing a lot of money that is actually marital funds will be tied up until the estate is settled. Average estate work takes 18 months to settle. Much longer if the trustee doesn't move quickly. \n\nIf there is disagreement between the wife and the brother about what is a marital asset and what is not the brother's decision stands unless the wife challenges it in court. Examples: is a car bought during the marriage marital property? Generally yes, but could the brother argue that it is not and was actually bought with royalty money preventing the wife from selling the car, yes. Could the brother determine furniture in her house is actually separate property? Yes, and he could take it and sell it, even if sentimental to the wife. Could the brother decide that an account that is solely in the husband's name is separate property and under the trust instead of marital income? Yes, then she would have to take the brother to court to contest that. Would she win? Probably, because in each scenario a judge will side with her about what the actually law would be. But she wouldn't have oversight over what is happening. That is scary for surviving spouses and definitely should have been a conversation. \n\nThe wife could still be the executor of his estate while keeping the brother as the trustee of the proceeds from the royalties. Frankly, they shouldn't be relying on a will to set these rights up in trust for their kids. If she had been there during the meeting with the attorneys they could have discussed what the best way to set up the trust would be. \n\nThe crux of the \"asshole\" determination for me is that he left her out of the discussion. Maybe she agrees with the children getting the funds but doesn't want little Susie to be able to blow all the money when she turns 18.
