{"id": 14975, "submission_id": "12ol7b4", "title": "WIBTA for leaving them to their own mess and taking the cat?", "selftext": "Last week my mother asked if I could take care of her house while she and my stepdad went on a much-needed vacation. This is a normal thing for us with them going on vacations every couple months and me taking care of the house and any pets, no payment needed. Recently they adopted the most lovable adorable cat who is apple of my dad's eye. This cat is the best sweetest lil guy who loves hugs and cuddles and I absolutely adore him. To my allergy's protest, I let little man cuddle me and ride around on my shoulders while I move about the house taking Benadryl and using my inhaler.\n\nThe cat is not the problem, the problem is what my stepsister and her boyfriend do every time my parents go on vacation. Once the suitcases are in the trunk the wheels hit the road, those two are in the house eating everything, making messes, leaving the doors open, and making themselves at home.\n\nMy parents have been gone for less than 24 hours, and I have only been out of the house to sleep and take care of my own pets. In the time I was gone the house is a complete mess. The sink and dishwasher are full of dirty dishes, there is mud and leaves all over the floors, the garbage is overflowing, and to my horror the sliding back door was left slightly open. Luckly, the cat was too scared to leave the house. As soon as I walked in the door this morning, he came running to me hungry and locked out of the bedroom where his bed because that's where my stepsister and her boyfriend have holed up.\n\nI made sure to cuddle the little guy to help calm the fear he had and fill his toppled over feeder. Begrudgingly I started cleaning up the mess but when I made it to the second bathroom with its toilet unflushed and shit streaks all over the rim of the seat, I lost what little cool I had left. I've tried banging on the door to tell the two to leave but from what my deaf ass can tell is that their refusing to come out and they won't answer the any texts.\n\nSO would I be the asshole to take the cat back to my house with me until my parents get home and let them deal with the mess that is stepsister and her boyfriend?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWell, my mom and I had...a talk. She agreed that the two shouldn't be in the house BUT since they have the garage code that's on them. She said we've already spoke about this with their last vacation. When it comes to the stepsister and her boyfriend I'll have to deal with it until she and dad get home.\n\n\"I know that with you being there, everything will be fine when we get back.\" As long as the house is clean she says all is good, she and I will have to have a talk about this whole \"ordeal\" when she gets home from her cruise. In her mind it's just a little allergy and I'm being sensitive. Everything is going to be fine.\n\nYeah, I wouldn't really use the word fine to describe anything here. I'm finding out just how far I can push my cat allergy and it's not going so well.\n\nSo for the comment that said it felt like they were doing it on purpose...you were right it seems my mom is. Sadly I don't think my dad has any idea what's going on but that tends to be how things are with those two.\n\nLooks like my mom lost her housesitter after this vacation. I'll clean it and leave a list with pictures of everything that needs cleaning or fixed while they were gone that way my dad can see it all as well.\n\nAS FOR THE KITTY. Little man is doing just fine and is a ball of furry energy. My fiance is going to be taking care of him when they're off work so I can get breaks and quarantine myself away until I can calm my hives and swelling. I'll only have to be full contact with the little guy for 8ish hours a day so here's to Benadryl and my inhaler for helping me make it through.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo sorry everyone!! I didn't word that last part right.\n\nI am not cleaning up the nastiness that is the stepsister and boyfriend, I am cleaning up the kitty mess. He is an anxious eater and digger so I cleaned up the kitty food and litter on the floor. I didn't want there to be anything the two could blame on the cat.\n\nNo worries the list of things is what I found needing to be cleaned with pictures and today's date so they can see the progression of the mess.", "created_utc": 1681672023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ol7b4/wibta_for_leaving_them_to_their_own_mess_and/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
