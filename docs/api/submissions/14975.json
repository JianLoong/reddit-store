This is a normal thing for us with them going on vacations every couple months and me taking care of the house and any pets, no payment needed. Recently they adopted the most lovable adorable cat who is apple of my dad's eye. This cat is the best sweetest lil guy who loves hugs and cuddles and I absolutely adore him. To my allergy's protest, I let little man cuddle me and ride around on my shoulders while I move about the house taking Benadryl and using my inhaler.\n\nThe cat is not the problem, the problem is what my stepsister and her boyfriend do every time my parents go on vacation. Once the suitcases are in the trunk the wheels hit the road, those two are in the house eating everything, making messes, leaving the doors open, and making themselves at home.\n\nMy parents have been gone for less than 24 hours, and I have only been out of the house to sleep and take care of my own pets. In the time I was gone the house is a complete mess. The sink and dishwasher are full of dirty dishes, there is mud and leaves all over the floors, the garbage is overflowing, and to my horror the sliding back door was left slightly open. Luckly, the cat was too scared to leave the house. As soon as I walked in the door this morning, he came running to me hungry and locked out of the bedroom where his bed because that's where my stepsister and her boyfriend have holed up.\n\nI made sure to cuddle the little guy to help calm the fear he had and fill his toppled over feeder. Begrudgingly I started cleaning up the mess but when I made it to the second bathroom with its toilet unflushed and shit streaks all over the rim of the seat, I lost what little cool I had left. I've tried banging on the door to tell the two to leave but from what my deaf ass can tell is that their refusing to come out and they won't answer the any texts.\n\nSO would I be the asshole to take the cat back to my house with me until my parents get home and let them deal with the mess that is stepsister and her boyfriend?", "created_utc": 1681672023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ol7b4/wibta_for_leaving_them_to_their_own_mess_and/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents don\u2019t want to come home to a missing, (runaway out the open door!) cat, now, *do* they! \n\nAnd take photos of the house and how it is trashed. I would say to wait to clean until right before they come home, since you *were* asked to \u201ctake care of the house\u201d, but, damn, there has to be a limit?! You don\u2019t even live there. Be glad.\n\nBut it sounds like the adult stepsister, (and maybe her BF, *too*) do live there. That stepsister wasn\u2019t asked to take care of the place-well, it says a lot.

Let those disgusting, foul pigs suffer the consequences when your folks get home.", "NTA Seems like your only move.", "NTA. Take the cat home. Tell your parents the house is disgusting and you're not a maid.", "How long are they out of town? If your stepsister and her boyfriend are that irresponsible/messy to the point where you dont believe they will remember to feed the kitty, give it water and clean its litter (which is very important otherwise they can get infections etc) then take the kitty with you and care for it in the meantime. \n\nNo matter what- NTA. Youre looking out for an animal that cant care for itself and something your dad cares about alot.", "NTA. Take pics of the chaos stepsister & bf are causing. Then send your mom the pics with a promise that the cat is safe at your place. You shouldn't have to clean up their messes. Poor kitty is relying on you to take care of him & I'm glad that you are willing to step up for him. Allergies notwithstanding.", "NTA. I would text/call your parents and tell them what you are doing and why. Take pictures to go with it.\n\nYou were there to keep an eye on things, not be a maid to your stepsister. If they want maid service, they have to pay for it.", "NTA. Save the kitty and take him home with you. Leave the mess but notify mom and stepdad who is staying in their house and making the mess. Don't clean up after the slovenly twosome, they are counting on you not wanting the mess when your mom comes home. Give kitty an extra treat and pat for me.", "NTA, take the cat, take pictures send them to your parents. Make sure to document if something got broken and that's it.", "NTA save the cat", "NTA. Seriously, shit streaks? What are they, even pigs aren't that nasty.", "NTA. Hopefully when your mom comes home, she will demand the keys from your stepsister so she won't be doing this again when your mom is gone. Your sister sounds entitled and is taking advantage of you and your mom. \n\nSo glad you're taking the cat so he can be safe. Agree with another redditor who said it sounds like your stepsister is on drugs. The mess you described is not normal adult behavior.", "NTA and its time the dirty couple is dealt by your parents. Its not upto you to clear their mess as its not your house and not your problem.", "NTA\n\n\nThe only responsible thing to do is to take the cat with you, since you can't be sure the door will be closed and you want to make sure kitty is safe, because that is what your parents entrusted to you. And of course you don't want to intrude on stepsister and boyfriend's private time, so you won't be stopping by the house uninvited, and obviously they are keeping the house occupied so parents don't have to worry about a vacant house.\n\n\nTake pics to send to parents, and tell them of your plans so they don't worry about kitty. Any other fallout is not your concern.", "NTA take the cat & all of its supplies. Send your parents a text explaining what you are doing & why, today. Send them photos of the condition of the home & let them know you are not a babysitter & will not be cleaning up after your stepsister.\n\nAsk them if they want you to call the police to have the stepsister & bf escorted out & you can change to code on the doors or if they want to deal with them when they return home.", "NTA. But call your parents and tell them what's going on as well. She's going to take off the day before they get back, and it's going to look like you left the house a disaster. Even if you have to let the kitten and your pets roam the house in shifts. Also, get the baby supplies (bowl, bed) to keep at your house. Future pet sitting gets easier without you having to worry about step sis and her house takeover again.", "Take pics and send them to your parent. You are NTA", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause you PROMISED to take care of the house. Be more careful with your promisses next time.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here.  ESH. You agreed to take care of the house and the cat.  You\u2019re responsible for the house and cat.  How did stepsis and her bf get in the house?  Did you let them in?  Do they have a key?  This happens \u201cevery time\u201d they go on vacation?  Why are you not discussing this up front with your parents?   \n\n\nYou need to be very firm that you will not be housesitting while they have access to the house.  If your parents want them to have access (ie, they have a key), then they need to have them housesit.  If they don\u2019t have a key, you were extremely foolish to let them in, knowing how they act.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
