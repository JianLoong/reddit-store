So even though it is church's rules, it was your parents' rule that you not cut your hair.  You are 15, not 18.  Which means that they are still accountable for you.  I say that, because yes it is your body, but you are still a minor.  Your parents don't trust you anymore.  Maybe this one incident was minor to most people, but you knew when you went that this was going to be the reaction you were going to get at home.  There was no going back because the hair was gone and there was no putting it back on.  I say this, because you are not the first one to do this.  My younger sister would put pants on when she got to school, then take them off in last period in the school bathroom.  Sound familiar?  I am going to say NAH, because it is hard to grow up with holiness standards, but at the same time you can't break rules (small or big for any reason) and expect your parents to still trust you.

Your brain is a physical organ that can get sick, with chemical reactions it that can go wrong. You would go to the doctor for a broken leg, right?
