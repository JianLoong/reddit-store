A few weeks ago, we were called to a fire in an apartment complex, and I was on the floor where the fire started when a fellow firefighter (let\u2019s call her Mary) was attempting to lift debris off an unconscious woman. I couldn\u2019t tell if the woman was alive, as we were on the floor where the fire started and the smoke was obscuring my vision.\n\nMary told me the woman was still breathing and once she got her out from under the debris, I confirmed it. I was lifting the woman out of a window towards the ladder truck when I heard a scream from Mary, and saw that more debris had fallen and her leg was pinned. I rushed back once the unconscious woman was secure and tried to help Mary, but she insisted I get out as the smoke was getting too thick. I continued to try and help her until the doorway i was underneath collapsed, and Mary was almost completely buried. She wasn\u2019t responding to me at this point, but I managed to check her pulse and she was still alive. I received an order over my radio to evacuate, and at this point the smoke was so thick that I could no longer see Mary. \n\nAfter a few more attempts of trying to save Mary, I left through the window and climbed down. \n\nOnce the fire was out, some of us went back in, and luckily Mary was still alive. They carried her out and she was taken to hospital, and unfortunately the leg that had been pinned had to be amputated. Mary is still in the hospital, as she\u2019s suffering from severe burns and inhaled a severe amount of smoke. \n\nOn Sunday, I was approached by Mary\u2019s brother at my house (God knows how he got my address), and he told me Mary might not ever be able to come back to work due to losing a leg. He kept saying that I could have done more to save her and that I was a coward for leaving before I could help her.\n\nI really thought I did everything I could, but now I\u2019m doubting myself. Could I have done more? Could I have saved her from losing a leg? I\u2019m really confused now, and could use an outside opinion. My captain and everyone else at the firehouse think I\u2019m in the right, but Mary\u2019s brother is so insistent that I\u2019m an asshole in this situation.

You should not feel any guilt. If you hadn\u2019t followed your supervisor\u2019s commands to exit the dwelling you may have died. Let that sink in. You did as you were told, and you did the right thing.

Your captain and colleagues are, and they say say you followed correct procedure (yes, I'm paraphrasing here), and they would be the ones who have real knowledge of what it's like in those situation.   \n\n\nThe only other thing that comes to mind is when they tell you (in airplane safety videos) to put your own mask on first before helping others - that's because you can't help others if you pass out, and then you're both in trouble.  Same here.  If you had stayed on when it was deemed unsafe, you too could have been pinned by falling debris, or overcome in some way.  Mary herself knew this, and told you to go.  And lastly, if you don't obey orders like this, then you put the rest of the team at risk (coming back in after more than one of you), and they can't trust you in the future.", "NTA, you are a hero.

He probably will end up apologizing later.", "Mary is alive. You did save her life! You couldn\u2019t free her leg in the thick smoke, but you stayed with her as long as you could. And when a supervisor says to evacuate, you must obey the command. Otherwise you could lose your job. If you had stayed, you could have lost your life.

We were the only two on the floor at the time as most of the other firefighters were working on evacuating people from lower floors, it was a 7 floor building, we were on the 5th floor. We were in full mask and oxygen, so breathing wasn\u2019t a problem for me, but Mary\u2019s oxygen and mask were gone when I got to her with the unconscious victim. I\u2019m not sure if it was an accident, or if Mary had given them to someone. Either way, I think she should have kept them on as it severely endangered her life. When we had the unconscious person on the ladder, the rest of the firefighters were focused on either putting out the fire or tending to survivors. The firefighter on the ladder was ordered to immediately bring the unconscious woman down as she had bruising on her abdomen that indicated internal injuries, so we had to get her transported quickly. I\u2019m unsure when they mayday was called, as I was too focused on putting out the fire to think about how much time had passed.

If I could have done more. You couldn\u2019t have. You did everything and sometimes we can\u2019t save everyone. \nYou are a hero.\nShe is a hero.", "The problem is she's in most likely an American. And we have shit health insurance. She's going to be settled with probably a six or seven figure medical bill. Many parts of the United States use volunteer firefighters. She might be able to recover.
