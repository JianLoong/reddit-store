This is where you guys come in on whether ITA or not. \n\nSo we moved in with my in-laws when my son was 10 weeks old. We were visiting them when my son was 2 weeks old, my MIL was holding my son who then started crying. 4 times I asked her for my son back she igored me, this is my first child after all. My husband got up and went to take him off her and she pulled away (my son is still crying and all she kept saying was its cramps) my FIL told her to give him back to me she said no no I calm him. She then put my son down to change him, I got up and took him back and he stopped crying.\n\nOver the next few months, she made it a huge deal that my son should be sleeping through the night at 6 weeks old because her son did (my husband) and that its my fault he's not sleeping through the night. She then proceeds to tell me what i can and cant dress my child in and also what he should and shouldnt be eating. I have stopped her from picking him up, she is not allowed to pick him up and of she does he's taken off her.\n\nShe went onto her husband and started giving out shit about me because of what I said and he's on my side which has pissed her off even more lol.

I mean, ours started to go 6hrs or more after 7 weeks, but every baby is different! Our pediatrician told us you either get a good day sleeper or a good night sleeper, no in between lol.
