We are in the middle of building our own family home so have moved back in with my in laws. This is where you guys come in on whether ITA or not. \n\nSo we moved in with my in-laws when my son was 10 weeks old. We were visiting them when my son was 2 weeks old, my MIL was holding my son who then started crying. 4 times I asked her for my son back she igored me, this is my first child after all. My husband got up and went to take him off her and she pulled away (my son is still crying and all she kept saying was its cramps) my FIL told her to give him back to me she said no no I calm him. She then put my son down to change him, I got up and took him back and he stopped crying.\n\nOver the next few months, she made it a huge deal that my son should be sleeping through the night at 6 weeks old because her son did (my husband) and that its my fault he's not sleeping through the night. She then proceeds to tell me what i can and cant dress my child in and also what he should and shouldnt be eating. I have stopped her from picking him up, she is not allowed to pick him up and of she does he's taken off her.\n\nShe went onto her husband and started giving out shit about me because of what I said and he's on my side which has pissed her off even more lol. She would say come to mama about herself, I had to tell my son no that's your nanny and I'm your mummy. Oh and to top it all off she wore white on my wedding day.\n\nAITA\n\n\nEdit: for those saying I'm using her for free. I'm not, I pay rent to her as well as money for food. I also do the house cleaning and cooking and anything else she needs help with so I am not using her for free. Also I do not hate her never said I did just being made to feel like I'm a shit mum because I'm dressing him in shit clothes that are not up to her standard etc. I adore this woman, its just since I've had my son shes turned against me.", "created_utc": 1704525297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zub02/aita_for_stopping_my_mil_from_holding_my_child/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a textbook r/justnomil", "The first parts seem like overreacting. The second sounds like bland and aggression. Yet they\u2019re willingly sharing their home, so it\u2019s complicated in how to respond without waging a war. Sounds like this is also outside the States due to the English being a little off. Is it common for MIL to be this overbearing and passive aggressive in more traditional countries?", "I'm paying rent so not using for free and I don't hate her I freaking adore her. I help around the house with everything cooking, cleaning etc. I do everything with but I'm a new mum and when your a new mum and have someone tell you your doing everything else you going g to feel like shit. I never once said in the post I hate her.

Until then we can't afford to rent anywhere at the moment.", "She only went like this after I had my son she completely changed. I wasn't expecting her to wear white on my wedding day either as she had been so sweet and respectful to me in the 14 years I'm with my husband. She showed me a completely different outfit to the one she wore on my day when I was 4months pregnant. It was the first time she ever did something like that on my wedding day and I just ignored it as we have got along for 14 years. I didn't have a choice to move in with them. We are building a house and I don't have any other family to stay with as they are in a different country. So only family I have is my husband, my son and my in-laws. So have  just moved in with them for the moment.", "I slept through at 7 hours", "[deleted]", "If you do adore her then I would suggest having a long conversation with her.\n\nI would tell her I adore you. I think you would be an amazing asset helping up with baby boy but you\u2019re going to have to accept the boundaries and rules I am sitting here.  List those boundaries in writing. That away she can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t say this. (I actually did this with my teenagers when they started driving! I sent the rules and boundaries in text messages. And made them acknowledge them and then screen shot that message to keep). Tell her she has until April to show great improvement. If she don\u2019t then you and your family will go no contact or limit contact.\n\nLet her know that you would love for your child to have an amazing relationship with his grandparents but she has to understand that your the parents and your in charge.\n\nIf you don\u2019t get things situated under control then the person you adore will not be in your life. Even over to go to a therapist to mediate conversation with her. Make sure you mention how hurt you were about the white at the wedding! Tell her how disrespected you fell.\n\nIf all this doesn\u2019t work then you can honestly say you did everything you can to make sure your son had his grandmother in his life. Your husband will respect the efforts you made with his mother. He will see you tried. This will go along way for him because it will show how much you love him.\n\n\nI think sometimes, even if you don\u2019t have to be, being the bigger person helps. At least you know in your heart you did everything you possibly could to improve your relationship. \n\nBut at the end of the day only you can decide if the mil you knew before you married her son is worth trying to get that person back. \n\nI would also say until mil has proved herself and earned your trust back she should never be left unsupervised with baby boy. It may be year if ever you fell comfortably with leaving her alone with him. And that\u2019s ok. She should just be happy that you cared enough to establish a relationship with her after the stunts she tried.", "So you moved in while pregnant and your son is 11months? Are you able to rent somewhere for a few months while you finish your house? A year there with these issues is just going to get scary worse as you come ckose to leaving.", "These type of women always get worse when a child is born. I hope your hubby has your back in dealing with her. Y\u2019all need to have a serious talk about boundaries and what the consequences will be. You should probably also have a back up plan if things go sideways before the house is ready. Every time you push back she\u2019s going to ramp up her efforts. Wearing white, calling herself mama, and not giving you your crying baby are all signs that she\u2019s been jealous and secretly competing with you in her mind.", "[deleted]", "she\u2019s not using her if she\u2019s paying rent , where did it say she doesn\u2019t work , she\u2019s also allowed to assert boundaries because at the end of the day it\u2019s her child", "Thank you, I think will definitely write it down and  maybe go to a therapist because then hopefully having a stranger there she might actually listen than having family there. I honestly do adore her she's the closest thing to a mother and we do almost everything together. Just need to her stop what she's doing and back a bit and let me be a new mum. But again thank you so much for this :)", "No my son was 10 weeks old when I moved in. No I'm not able to rent its too expensive and I'm a stay home mum as I had to leave my last job due to being bullied by the team leader.", "I'm paying her rent not using her for free", "I have to look them up on the internet by giving the initial on reddit.  I guess I've gotten old!", "I am deleting that i dodnt see in the post she was paying rent. I thought she said she wasn\u2019t paying rent because she was a sahm!\n\nI have since apologized to op for assuming wrong.", "First I want to apologize I honestly thought you were staying for free. So I should not have assumed.\n\nI think having a therapist is a good idea. Honestly if a grandparent is a good grandparent the kids can benefit.\n\nI would also ask the therapist to explain to mil hose her behavior is toxic and confusing to your little one.\n\nBut I also want to commend you it sounds like your willing to work on your relationship when you really don\u2019t have too. Your mil should appreciate that you are willing to work things out so she can continue to be a part of your life. Your family is lucky to have someone that shows compassion when they don\u2019t have to!\n\n\nI truly wish the best for you and your family! Just to remember to be honest with her and even work through the little thing. Little things let go become big issues later on!", "Is there any other family nearby (aunts, cousins, etc.) that could let you stay for a while?", "Please add that to your original post. That makes a big difference", "No need to apologise, it was my fault, I should have mentioned that in my og post but was trying to get bottles etc ready this morning when I wrote it before my little one woke up just been so forgetful lately lol thank you for saying that. I will do anything to have her in his life, even our life because my mum abandoned me and my brothers when I was a teenager and my brothers were like 9 and 6 at the time by sending us to a different country and wanting nothing to do with us. So I'm glad he has a grandmother in his life. I know she will do anything for him as its her first grandchild but saying that she really needs to take a stand back. She is great help when I need her to watch him for me and any tike she goes shop's she wants to bring him with her and I'm all for it. But it's the comments of how I'm doing everything wrong and he shouldn't be eating this and that or go change he im not bringing him to the shops wearing that etc.", "No I'm in Ireland and they all live in England unfortunately. My brothers and I came over here 16 years ago and my brothers all went back over when they hit late teens and now I'm the only one over here.", "When I became a grandmother I told my DILs and daughter that what I did 30plus years ago is not how things are done. So when it comes to helping we are all learning. Because my way is no longer done. So I know no more then they do.\n\nIf your mil is a reader suggest some baby books to help her understand that things are different.  I read baby care books with my first grandchild. Because I didn\u2019t want to do something wrong. \n\nHonestly you\u2019re doing good momma. Just remember at the end of the day as long as baby is happy, healthy, and feed it was a good day. Don\u2019t put to much pressure on your self. Every kid is different. As long as the baby is loves(and sounds like he is very loved) then the rest you will figure out as you go. \n\nBut honestly I think when you get your own home it will greatly help. My grandmother always said that no home was big enough for 2 families. I believe this to this day. You and your family need your space to establish your routine and your traditions. So hang in there it will get better!", "No one else from husband\u2019s family?", "Thank you this means alot. Yeah she doesn't believe on SIDS or flat head syndrome. She says it's made up to scare people and that public health nurses don't even know how to raise their own kids. As much as I love her I have never heard her speak like this till after my son was born.", "Yeah but unfortunately not room with them. I only have to stay here a few more months and then I'm out of here. Might even celebrate with a couple glasses of wine when we do lol"]}
