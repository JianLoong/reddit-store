Things can be much more or less expensive even by just altering things a day or two, or their chosen lodging may not be available.

(But I do say this as someone who absolutely believes that adult birthdays are not a big deal.)", "Info: are you actually 13?", "I think YTA for being bitter that your in laws don\u2019t celebrate your birthday, and then for taking it out in your son who would otherwise get to a enjoy a nice vacation with his grandparents.", "Is there any reason to think that he would be unsafe going on this trip? \nDo you have concerns that they are in capable of caring for and keeping him safe?\n\nIf this is just about your birthday then YTA", "NTA I think your instincts are probably right and it\u2019s deliberate. Hopefully they\u2019ve now got the message and won\u2019t try it again.", "Yeah, you are nta here.\nYou have a valid reason because it is important to you! That\u2019s it\u2026 id doesn\u2019t matter what others think about birthdays, it matters what you think!\nAnd you in-laws are Aholes for demanding and booking before even asking you.\nDoesn\u2019t matter that your husband knew they wanted to take your son.. he also didn\u2019t know the dates because they didn\u2019t ask/told them to him..\nDo what feels good for you\ud83d\udc4d", "the problem here is that your husband knew and forgot to tell u.  the other problem is he if he knows it bothers u each birthday they do stuff like this he doesnt shut it down and stand by u. you and your husband need to communicate about this as well as perhaps sitting the in laws down and telling them there is a pattern here and your feeling upset about it.", "I am older but I dont understand the whole adult birthday thing.  We might go out to eat for my birthday, typically anywhere from a week before to a week after depending on whats going on.  Why cant you celebrate the weekend before with the family?  Then let your son go on vacation - honestly what is the big deal?  This is irreplaceable time with his grandparents.  I would love to still have my grandparents to spend time with.\n\nI just think you are being a bit selfish.  I get wanting love on your birthday but can't that love be flexible by a few days?  Yes they can vacation at another time but they dont, it is what it is, the only persons behavior you can change here is your own.", "Why is it so important that your son spends your birthday with you? It's nice when the family is together, but is it really worth making him miss a vacation with his grandparents just because you need him there?", "Sorry, that was very rude of me. And good on you for wanting to spend it with family.", "It\u2019s a day. That can be celebrated on any day. This is the lesson I\u2019ve had to teach myself and my kids who now live in two households. I never wanted them to feel any bad feelings about not being with me for a holiday or my birthday. Yes, my ex is so spiteful that they weren\u2019t even allowed to call me on my birthday. So, guess what? I just change what day a holiday or birthday is. And my kids are happy. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re missing out or left out. You can make that one day for yourself any calendar day. And I say this as someone who has a birthday similar to yours. You\u2019re being selfish, and you\u2019re not seeing the big picture. Let your kid have opportunities. If you keep making his life about you and your needs only coming first, you will be resented, and there will come a point that you\u2019ll not see him or hear from him at all for your birthday. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re allowed to feel how you feel. Express to the ones you love about how it\u2019s important to feel celebrated, and figure out a way to do that. \n\nBut yes, YTA. Your children are not your property. They deserve to be treated like humans with wants, too.", "My twins also love their grandparents and you\u2019re right, they\u2019re going to hate they won\u2019t be going with them. So I will also have to deal with 2 other upset kids for the duration of the holiday because they will miss out.", "Yeah, they're probably doing this shit on purpose.  NTA.\n\nI think you should have a talk with them to find out why they feel the need to use your son in an effort to hurt you (because that's what they're actually doing).  This is a pissing contest that's gone nuclear.", "Info: when is your birthday? Is this like Memorial Day weekend? It seems like this is their preferred time of year for a vacation. Is there is a reason for that beyond evading your birthday? I feel that there is a buried lead here. We see this birthday issue for people born on/near holidays all the time. It just kinda sucks to be born on Christmas for instance. \n\nUgh, I think the biggest problem I have is that scheduling a vacation with multiple people around work schedules, school, kids summer camps, etc. is difficult. Like, if I called up my brother to take my nieces on a vacation, I\u2019m sure there would only be a few weeks available in the summer, because of all of their activities and their vacation plans.\n\nYou\u2019ve said \u201coh you\u2019ll miss my birthday\u201d but have you said \u201cI wish you would be there for my birthday, it\u2019s important to me\u201d? As someone who doesn\u2019t really care about birthdays, if someone said that to me I\u2019d be like \u201coh yeah that\u2019s unfortunate, anyway\u2026\u201d", "Oh completely and I can guarantee it comes down to the fact that I had cousins who regularly travelled in January and would miss my birthday parties. \n\nHonestly the fact they aren\u2019t around on my birthday is fine. But let me have my kids with me so I can enjoy the few years I have left with them under my roof to enjoy them with.\n\nI didn\u2019t know my husband when he was younger. But knowing my MIL she would have made a fuss about her kids home on her birthday. Heck, we always make sure we go to their place on her birthday.", "This 100%\nI have a friend whose Birthday is the 1st January, she has never celebrated on the day.", "Wrong comment mb!", "What a weird take. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for children and adults alike to miss things with friends because of a parent\u2019s birthday.", "Making a deal about your birthday as an adult is unseemly IMO. \n\nI am aware then most people disagree.", "Life would be easier if I was.", "What\u2019s wrong with her wanting to see her kid on her birthday? Her IL try to take her son on vacation every year on her birthday. That is fucked up. They don\u2019t do it on their sons birthday. Why do you think they always choose to do it on OP birthday ?", "God forbid a parent wants to celebrate another year of life with their child, what a horror and abusive person (/s).", "yup that is what i expect will happen. and even after the 13 year old returns and talk about his fantastic time they will be hurt even more", "Can I ask why? Adulthood has so few opportunities to focus on celebrating oneself, and so many responsibilities. \n\nI agree that anyone saying \u201cit\u2019s MY DAYYYY\u201d and asking people to bend over backwards, that\u2019s unseemly- but to just want family close for a quiet celebration? I guess my question is where you draw the line. Is it the simple point of acknowledging the birthday? \n\nI ask because OP doesn\u2019t seem to want all the focus on her, she just wants some basic acknowledgment, reflected in her family\u2019s planning/logistics"]}
