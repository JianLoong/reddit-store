I guarantee Ali was actively looking for somewhere else to move and this was an offer she couldn\u2019t pass up. If family helps why doesn\u2019t everyone else help pitch in to get them an apartment etc?

That\u2019s a sad situation and if the family is so concerned why not help her apply for housing and assistance? No one is responsible for her and her children just her and those who fathered them. Hope she figures it out! Free yourself from guilt and stand on your boundaries. Good luck.", "Lol, so your aunt wants you to:\n\n- take in 4 ppl\n- give up your bedroom to them\n- move your office to the living room\n- most likely get rid of the dogs (as soon she remembers them or emma sees them they will demand this)\n- living with a newborn and most likely providing free childcare bc she is exhausted from taking care of 3 kids\n- feeding them on your expenses\n- and as the cherry on top: you should pay for everything  for the unforseenable future\n\n\nHahaha, the audacity! \n\nNTA\n\nI guess its time for emma to find out who the dads are and bring them to court for childsupport.", "NTA. Congratulations to Ali on figuring out that she needs to live her own life free of the parasite that is Emma.\n\nStand strong. Do not sacrifice your own (and your wife's) lifestyle, peace, and home for Emma. You have your responsibilities, she has hers. Just because she has shirked hers for years does not mean that you should do harm to your own family to support her.\n\nAs others have said, DO NOT let them through the door, even for a visit. Never let these people in your house for a single second. You do not owe anyone, even 'family,' your life, home, and resources. Emma's mother can figure out how to support Emma, maybe by finding a shelter/transitional housing or whatever public housing assistance is available. Her situation really sucks, but there is nothing you can do about it without making your situation suck...and that's just not a reasonable request (much less demand). Emma and her mother are overly entitled and clueless.", "NTA. Your cousin is responsible for her own life choices. If it had been a one time down on her luck situation and she needed a little help for a limited time, I could maybe see your aunt's side; but that's not the case.

Your cousin has made some stupid decisions in her life, and just because she has been allowed to sponge off one cousing doesnt mean she is allowed to sponge off you. \n\nIf family feels that you should pay for her and make egregious accomodations for her, they are welcome to host her at their houses.", "NTA- this sounds like a her problem,  not a your problem.

You will not be able to make her leave !! \n\nDo not let her enter the house at all cost !!", "Ok she has two kids and a baby on the way so she need to go and declare herself homeless and get housing. \nNTA don't let her stay.

And there is no need to financially support them either.", "NTA and stand firm. If they want to help her out so badly THEY can take her in or find her an apartment and pay the rent. Either way its not your problem.", "NTA.  For all the reasons that you said.  Your place is too small for another adult and 2 kids, and then a baby.  Emma has created the life she is living.  If she is in the United States, Medicaid and public housing may be in her future.  They will go after the fathers for support.  If you let her move in, she will never move out.  If Emma does show up, **do not let her in the door**.  Blake will know what to do.", "NTA, not even remotely. It\u2019s not your fault she can\u2019t support herself and her own kids.\n\nYou are not responsible for the kids she chose to have. You are not responsible for your aunts child. You are not financially responsible for an entire family you didn\u2019t choose to have. You also physically and logically cannot make it work. \n\nAdd onto that her guilt tripping you and trying to just show up so you don\u2019t have an option.", "NTA stand your ground and not even open the door if they show up in case they try to barge in. Depending in which country your are there are probably social housing options available for a single mother with childs. Not your problem anyway, your poor other cousin had to move to another state to get rid of her", "NTA.  This is not a family helps family situation.  This is a family mooching off of family situation.  Emma is a grown ass woman with two children living off of her cousin who chose to focus on having sex instead of getting a job to support her and her children.  Now she is a pregnant with a 3rd child she can't support and no place to live. I understand accidents happened but if you have two children and no job to support them than  dating or sex should be the last thing you are thinking about. \nYour primary focus should be on providing for yourself and your children. The best advice you could give her is to consider adoption in hopes of giving at least her new baby a chance at a better life.", "NTA.  If she can get knocked up by three different men, that's three people to pay child support.  Aunt can take her \"family helps\" attitude and shove it,  she can move in with her daughter then.", "NTA.  Sad.  Emma made a mess of her life all by herself.  IMO someone should call child services if that is available in your country.", "NTA. Emma needs to figure out her life or move in with her mom. It\u2019s none of your business. I just can\u2019t understand having kids you can\u2019t take care of. Don\u2019t sacrifice you marriage and peace of mind for Emma and 3 kids.", "NTA what on earth makes these people so entitled? They dont get to steamroller your life just because Emma makes unsound decisions. No I'm sorry, it's not on you to mop up the mess. Unfortunately Emma is going to have to solve this one for herself. \n\nFolks who think you're a jerk are welcome to open their home to Emma and her children. I wouldnt worry about negative opinion. It's my experience that if people are going to talk nasty about you, then they have probably already talked nasty about you over stuff before now. Reasonable people are generally reasonable no matter what occurs. If folks are being nasty, they were already nasty, you just hadnt seen it.\n\nNo, Emma needs to contact the authorities who deal with social housing. It's time for her to stand on her own two feet.", "NTA. But damn your Aunt is ! How is it a way to ask to let someone in YOUR house rent free !?\nHope they won't show up.", "NTA.\nLet all the family that think 'family helps family' all chip in for an apartment for her and to pay her bills... see if they change their tune then.

My head is freaking exploding!  Good for you for standing your ground so clearly.  If aunt is that worried about them, she can put them in her bedroom, build an addition to her house, rent them an apartment--what the F ever.  This is so not your problem!!
