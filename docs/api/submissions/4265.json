When I was younger my mum and dad always compared me to my sister \u2018The Golden Child \n\nI never had a birthday party or even got a gift if I did I would have to give it to my sister. Pretty much if I wanted a present I would have to get money for it myself.\n\nAs soon as I got a job my parents said I had to start paying rent and getting food for breakfast, lunch and dinner if I wanted to eat. So I had to work for everything I wanted.\n\nAt the age of 18, my parents kicked me out and I went to live with my boyfriend, to who I am now married too, and we now have a 5-year-old and twins on the way.\n\nSo my parents were never there when my oldest was born or when I got married but they were there when my sister got married and had her baby. She also still lives with my parents and her husband and her nor her husband have jobs to support themselves. One day, my mom and dad invited me, my husband and our oldest to their house for Thanksgiving. My parents started the conversation off by saying how beautiful their grandchild was and how much prettier my sister was compared to me. My mom said \u2018Since your pregnancy you\u2019ve been starting to look old. Look at your sister she still looks like she is 14.\u2019 By how my husband looked he seemed visibly uncomfortable with the comment she made. We were just about to leave when my Dad asked me if I could give him some money or they would end up homeless. I replied saying \u2018How do you not have any money for the house you earned a lot when you were a doctor\u2019 He said that my sister used it for her expensive clothes for her and the baby. I replied angrily stating that \u2018Why should I even give you a cent you never cared to waste atleast one on me\u2019 The whole room went silent full of rage  me and my husband left the house and went back home. Most of my family members decided to call me and shout at me for not helping them even though they never cared about me. My sister later on called me to tell me I was being a spoiled brat that I couldn\u2019t even help them a little and that I don\u2019t need all the money I have. I hung up and blocked everyone who was bashing me online. So AITA?\n\nEXTRA INFO:\nDad is retired,Mom is a teacher and like I said sister and BIL don\u2019t work.
