My 10yo daughter has a light unibrow. A year ago she started saying kids were making fun of it and she wanted it gone. After making sure SHE was sure, and letting her know plucking hurts, she finally convinced me that she really wanted it. It grows back quick, I only do it when she brings it up to me(when it bothers her). If you're sister is that uncomfortable, she may be getting bullied for it. I did also tell my kid that most women have mustaches that they bleach, shave, or wax, so she didn't feel too bad about her brows", "NTA. Doesn't matter what your mom thinks. If your little sister wants it off, she should have the autonomy to do so. 14 is plenty old to be making decisions about your own appearance. But she should be aware that having it is not an issue. She should be removing it because she wants to,  not because she feels pressured by beauty standards.", "NTA - I got bullied soooo bad her age for facial hair. This would help with that, although with these emotionally abusive parents I'm not sure her mental health will fair well anyway...", "NTA - it\u2019s cruel to not allow your sister to remove her facial hair if that\u2019s what she wants.", "NTA\n\nIf adult females are allowed to shave or remove body hair, then are THEY saying that 'body hair isn't ok'?  Why is it different if someone younger does it?  This seems hypocritical and lacking in logic at the least.\n\nIf it was a religious or philosophical principle (ie you NEVER got rid of the hair) then I could understand it.  But, this is not a hill to die on.  She is becoming a young woman and may notice that others around her do not have as much hair, she may even have had others draw attention to it.  You as an older woman were introducing her to her basic feminine ways.\n\nShe does live with your parents and thus has to be subject to the rules of their house.  I'm sorry that they reacted like they did.  In a calmer moment, I would ask your Mom, what precisely is her objection to the removal of hair, given that it causes your Sister anxiety?", "NTA. Your sister asked you for it and it bothers her, and you helped.", "I would say NTA. When I was younger I would always, always get bullied for the hair. I'm Hungarian so we got the thick hair. I had leg hair from when I was 11 and my parents would never let me do anything about it until I was 15. But of by that time the damage was done. \n\nI was so self conscious about it, I wished I had a sister like you. Because how it worked for me if I was actually allowed to do something about it to stop the bullying, then I still probably wouldn't be so self conscious. \n\nI've done a lot of work on myself, and the fact that I'm still so adamant and self conscious about the hair is because my inner child is still so hurt and wounded from it. Am I trying to work on it, yes. But if I was allowed to do something about it to not get bullied, I know as an adult I wouldn't actually give two shits. \n\nI understand that it might be a culture thing, but your sister was pleading for help. She's probably hurting inside just like I was so your parents ignoring that? Not okay. I hope you're able to open their eyes a bit to see that they are neglecting their child. \n\nOr at the very least, get them to explain why they have such issues with it. Then your little sister can understand why and maybe she can at least defend herself against the bullies. (If there are any, I'm assuming yes because kids are jerks and that's how most female children are treated on topics like these.) \n\nWe need to build up self confidence, which is really hard when the people you spend mass majority of your day with beat you down. \n\nHair grows back, always does. So protect your peace and don't get trauma bonded to the shame of having hair, if that means we gotta do it to avoid the situations, then so be it. If there's an issue, then do what you need to to feel your peace. People don't tend to have a proper sense of self until even late 20s. We don't have good foundations to build on and we're still trying to figure out who we are. When we get pushed down it just makes it harder to find who we are.\n\nWhen we do have the sturdy sense of self though, it's a lot easier to no longer give a **** about what others say about/to you. \n\nDon't know if that made sense, but that's my view point of it. Synopsis for action would be I'd highly highly suggest properly sitting down with your parents and try to have a healthy talk with them as well as a talk with your sister.\n\nI'd talk to your sister first, ask her why she feels so uncomfortable with the hair, get her to actually explain it. If there's bullies or something of that sort. Go from there. If it is something to do with bullies or something of the sort, then talk with your parents. Don't start off with what your sister said, see their side first to avoid bringing up defenses.\n\nJust say, hey I know I ended up stepping on your toes with this situation. I'd really like to properly understand where this rule is coming from so that I know in the future. Can we do that? \n\nThen hopefully once they explain it then you can slid in and explain possibly how your sister is feeling. Open their eyes to her side. \n\nIf they refuse, well sadly there's not a whole lot you can do except be there for your sister and support her because she ain't getting the support she needs from your parents. It's lonely not having your family be there yet not. \n\nSo do your best, I hope you the best and you're a wonderful older sister. Your sister is very, very lucky to have you. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA ur parents suck and should care more about their own daughters feelings, i get it might be culture though.", "NTA. We girls got to keep them mustaches WAXED, ya hear. If we want to. That has nothing to do with teaching that body hair is or isn't okay. It's a personal preference, and poor girl preferred no, and you were a good big sister and tried to help", "NTA \n\nAs someone who has the same problem. I wish my mom let me do that. It destroyed how I viewed myself. This wasn't you pushing it, but her.", "Technically both.\n\nNTA, for what you did for your sister and the reason you did. You\u2019re just being a good older sibling.\n\nYTA, \n\nRegardless if you agree or not. You aren\u2019t her parent and knowingly did something they weren\u2019t going to approve. You overstepped your place. \n\nNot saying that I agree with your parents rules (definitely don\u2019t) . But gotta be unbiased and you did cross the line.

It\u2019s just hair.", "NTA it is a cultural thing it seems. You didn't harm your sister at all or her views just letting you know. I grew up with only boys and they used to tease me non stop even got there friends to call me names. I think the peak of my hair removal journey was when I was in 7th grade, I had hella hair bad which also if you're Southeast Asian and you noticed your sister's dark hair and she did too it might be an actual medication condition. See during my journey I didn't know I had PCOS a hormonal condition. So my facial hair and arm hair and any hair on my body was actually like way worst than some teenage boys. My mom was the same way ignored my pleas even though I had HAIRY face. Soooo back to my story so I'm in art class it's dead silent we meditating on a song we just heard, my bully since 3rd grade looks over at my arms and yells YOURE A WEREWOLF! HOLY SHIT YOUR ARMS ARE DARKER THAN MINE! He was a bully but it didn't stop there he got the whole school to rally and make me cry yelling WEREWOLF ARMS HAIRY CHIPMUNK FACE! literally my whole class was chanting that. Safe to say it was actually the pretty popular girl that lived next to me that showed me how to shave. I'll never forget her.", "NTA....if you didn't pay for her to get it waxed, she would have found a way to do it herself.\n\nI'm Middle Eastern and my mom was the same way when I was growing up....I just started pushing back around 15 years old, did whatever I felt like.\n\nShe continued trying to be controlling (even after I had a family of my own, including 3 kids). I cut her off completely a year ago and have never looked back.\n\nI hope your parents see how much damage their controlling behavior can cause before it's too late.", "Nta. I also got bullied.", "I'm pretty sure it's just a cultural thing. Apparently, with all my other asian friends and myself, we all had the same experience so I never really looked into the deeper meaning.", "Yeah, it's definitely a cultural thing which I guess is why my parents reacted so badly to it.", "I totally get it. This is kinda why I feel super conflicted about what went down and wanted to hear everyone's opinions. Hopefully they eventually call me and listen to me and my sis", "Is your mom also against threading? \n\nMy mom hated the idea of shaving cause she was worried about me cutting myself. And it took awhile for her to accept that I was \u201cgrown\u201d enough to handle it. But taking her to a professional negates that issue so\u2026. \n\nNTA btw. That would definitely be one of those things I\u2019d ask forgiveness for instead of permission. Especially bc hair grows back?  Unfortunately even on your face\u2026 \n\nDoes your mom have facial hair issues too? Bc I\u2019d argue that she should keep it if she wants to be so body hair positive. She\u2019s an adult and much more capable of being strong in standing up to society than a 14yo would be. And teens are just awful when it comes to finding something \u201cdifferent\u201d to harp on about someone. Asking your sister to deal with that is cruel if it can be helped.", "Yeah because it kinda seems the reason for the rule is coming from a place of \u201c be happy and confidant with how you look\u201d . \nI got this from what you posted on them saying you were basically telling her body hair is bad.\n\nIt\u2019s just that they\u2019re taking it to the extreme. I\u2019m all for body positivity but I shave my unibrow lol.\nSince that\u2019s the case, as long as they\u2019re open to communication, common ground should be possible.", "The thing that's kinda hypocritical about her is that she, herself, gets waxed. She's just against it because of cultural differences and claims that its inappropriate for a young girl to get waxed or threaded or even shave. \n\nI wasn't allowed to shave my legs growing up, but we grew in a predominantly poc community so it didn't bother me. However, they recently moved into a more white neighborhood, which I can explain why my sister feels more of the urge to blend in.", "I think it's coming more from a cultural, conservative perspective. The main argument was my mom claiming it's inappropriate that young girls get rid of body hair or wear makeup. Even the nail colors have to be very neutral tones. \n\nI've been talking to my dad on the phone and apparently he really didn't mind or notice, but it was my mom that's not really willing to listen right now which is hard. I also tried convincing her that it's not that big difference between shaving/waxing when you're 14yo vs 18yo since my mom gets waxes herself, but she's claiming it's too inappropriate for a young girl."]}
