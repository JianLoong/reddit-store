My 10yo daughter has a light unibrow. A year ago she started saying kids were making fun of it and she wanted it gone. After making sure SHE was sure, and letting her know plucking hurts, she finally convinced me that she really wanted it. It grows back quick, I only do it when she brings it up to me(when it bothers her). If you're sister is that uncomfortable, she may be getting bullied for it. I did also tell my kid that most women have mustaches that they bleach, shave, or wax, so she didn't feel too bad about her brows", "NTA. Doesn't matter what your mom thinks. If your little sister wants it off, she should have the autonomy to do so. 14 is plenty old to be making decisions about your own appearance. But she should be aware that having it is not an issue. She should be removing it because she wants to,  not because she feels pressured by beauty standards.", "NTA - I got bullied soooo bad her age for facial hair. This would help with that, although with these emotionally abusive parents I'm not sure her mental health will fair well anyway...", "NTA - it\u2019s cruel to not allow your sister to remove her facial hair if that\u2019s what she wants.", "NTA\n\nIf adult females are allowed to shave or remove body hair, then are THEY saying that 'body hair isn't ok'?  Why is it different if someone younger does it?  This seems hypocritical and lacking in logic at the least.\n\nIf it was a religious or philosophical principle (ie you NEVER got rid of the hair) then I could understand it.  But, this is not a hill to die on.  She is becoming a young woman and may notice that others around her do not have as much hair, she may even have had others draw attention to it.  You as an older woman were introducing her to her basic feminine ways.\n\nShe does live with your parents and thus has to be subject to the rules of their house.  I'm sorry that they reacted like they did.  In a calmer moment, I would ask your Mom, what precisely is her objection to the removal of hair, given that it causes your Sister anxiety?", "NTA. Your sister asked you for it and it bothers her, and you helped.", "I would say NTA. When I was younger I would always, always get bullied for the hair. I'm Hungarian so we got the thick hair. I had leg hair from when I was 11 and my parents would never let me do anything about it until I was 15. But of by that time the damage was done. \n\nI was so self conscious about it, I wished I had a sister like you. Because how it worked for me if I was actually allowed to do something about it to stop the bullying, then I still probably wouldn't be so self conscious. \n\nI've done a lot of work on myself, and the fact that I'm still so adamant and self conscious about the hair is because my inner child is still so hurt and wounded from it. Am I trying to work on it, yes. But if I was allowed to do something about it to not get bullied, I know as an adult I wouldn't actually give two shits. \n\nI understand that it might be a culture thing, but your sister was pleading for help. She's probably hurting inside just like I was so your parents ignoring that? Not okay. I hope you're able to open their eyes a bit to see that they are neglecting their child. \n\nOr at the very least, get them to explain why they have such issues with it. Then your little sister can understand why and maybe she can at least defend herself against the bullies. (If there are any, I'm assuming yes because kids are jerks and that's how most female children are treated on topics like these.) \n\nWe need to build up self confidence, which is really hard when the people you spend mass majority of your day with beat you down. \n\nHair grows back, always does. So protect your peace and don't get trauma bonded to the shame of having hair, if that means we gotta do it to avoid the situations, then so be it. If there's an issue, then do what you need to to feel your peace. People don't tend to have a proper sense of self until even late 20s. We don't have good foundations to build on and we're still trying to figure out who we are. When we get pushed down it just makes it harder to find who we are.\n\nWhen we do have the sturdy sense of self though, it's a lot easier to no longer give a **** about what others say about/to you. \n\nDon't know if that made sense, but that's my view point of it. Synopsis for action would be I'd highly highly suggest properly sitting down with your parents and try to have a healthy talk with them as well as a talk with your sister.\n\nI'd talk to your sister first, ask her why she feels so uncomfortable with the hair, get her to actually explain it. If there's bullies or something of that sort. Go from there. If it is something to do with bullies or something of the sort, then talk with your parents. Don't start off with what your sister said, see their side first to avoid bringing up defenses.\n\nJust say, hey I know I ended up stepping on your toes with this situation. I'd really like to properly understand where this rule is coming from so that I know in the future. Can we do that? \n\nThen hopefully once they explain it then you can slid in and explain possibly how your sister is feeling. Open their eyes to her side. \n\nIf they refuse, well sadly there's not a whole lot you can do except be there for your sister and support her because she ain't getting the support she needs from your parents. It's lonely not having your family be there yet not. \n\nSo do your best, I hope you the best and you're a wonderful older sister. Your sister is very, very lucky to have you. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA ur parents suck and should care more about their own daughters feelings, i get it might be culture though.", "NTA.

I grew up with only boys and they used to tease me non stop even got there friends to call me names. I think the peak of my hair removal journey was when I was in 7th grade, I had hella hair bad which also if you're Southeast Asian and you noticed your sister's dark hair and she did too it might be an actual medication condition. See during my journey I didn't know I had PCOS a hormonal condition. So my facial hair and arm hair and any hair on my body was actually like way worst than some teenage boys. My mom was the same way ignored my pleas even though I had HAIRY face. Soooo back to my story so I'm in art class it's dead silent we meditating on a song we just heard, my bully since 3rd grade looks over at my arms and yells YOURE A WEREWOLF! HOLY SHIT YOUR ARMS ARE DARKER THAN MINE! He was a bully but it didn't stop there he got the whole school to rally and make me cry yelling WEREWOLF ARMS HAIRY CHIPMUNK FACE! literally my whole class was chanting that.

Unfortunately even on your face\u2026 \n\nDoes your mom have facial hair issues too? Bc I\u2019d argue that she should keep it if she wants to be so body hair positive. She\u2019s an adult and much more capable of being strong in standing up to society than a 14yo would be. And teens are just awful when it comes to finding something \u201cdifferent\u201d to harp on about someone.

The main argument was my mom claiming it's inappropriate that young girls get rid of body hair or wear makeup. Even the nail colors have to be very neutral tones. \n\nI've been talking to my dad on the phone and apparently he really didn't mind or notice, but it was my mom that's not really willing to listen right now which is hard.

Kids go through so much. Helping her not be self conscious and possibly stopping her from being bullied are both necessary. I understand why your parents are upset, but honestly you're NTA for this one. Maybe when she's older she'll feel more confident and not want to remove her body hair.

By that I mean, no legal system on earth would stand by you that this rule makes them unfit and require outside intervention.

When she was in third grade (8 years old) the girls in her class started teasing her about it. I bought her a razor and taught her how to use it *that day.* Her father blew up!

Maybe get her a tweezer and teach her how to pluck appropriately (not over pluck) that way she can keep up with the maintenance discretely if she chooses", "NTA\n\nYou did right by your sister, and your parents rules are insane.", "Nta. 14 is definitely old enough to decide on whether they want body hair or not, plus it grows back. Shaving and waxing isn\u2019t permanent and it\u2019s honestly something everyone should learn about/how to do(the shaving part) just in case they decide they want to do so in the future, that way they can do it safely. Not allowing someone to learn those options can lead to injuries later on when they\u2019re older, or even issues with their body image since if they\u2019re unhappy with their appearance it\u2019ll effect their whole life", "Nta. She\u2019s old enough to make decisions about her own body hair.", "NTA. I was bullied severely for having arm hair when I was in 3th grade. It's blonde... I can't imagine how it must be to have darker hair. The beauty of self esteem is that it's what makes US happy. Hence the self part.", "NTA. 14 (past puberty) is plenty old enough to have autonomy over your own facial hair. And your mom is cruel to make her go around with a mustache...

Your little sister was feeling self-conscious about it, and you took her to get it waxed. Doesn\u2019t sound like you said anything negative about having body hair, and your mom\u2019s rule seems a bit overly strict. You helped your sister stand up for her own bodily autonomy!", "I think that's a really great way of putting it. After the incident, I texted my sister to let her know that she wasn't in the wrong for wanting to get rid of it, but to also understand that there isn't anything wrong with natural body hair. She told me that she appreciates what I said, and that she'll try talking to my mom one on one so hopefully things get better.", "Exactly. Of course it\u2019s important to teach kids to not care so much abt others\u2019 opinions on how you look, it\u2019s still important to take into consideration the fact that bullying in school can be detrimental. One remark abt body hair in middle school is enough to make someone insecure abt it for decades", "I mean, 14 years old is literally legally old enough to make medical decisions independently so long as you have demonstrated maturity and understanding. So really I'd argue that it's actually not the parents' place to enforce these kind of rules on what their 14 year old does with her body, given that the changes she wants to make are completely reversible.", "As an older sister, I\u2019m sure you know that for a lot of body stuff, the only way to be comfortable with your body/ comfortable not adhering to beauty standards can be to just\u2026 grow past it. When I was 14 I swore I would never have visible body hair. At 35 I kinda like rocking underarm hair. But both have been my choice about what I was happy with at the time. \n\nI think you should also talk to your *mom* about the fact that currently, the only person really pressuring your sister about adhering to beauty standards is your mom herself. Preventing your sister from what she wants to do with her body isn\u2019t somehow noble because it\u2019s in defiance of beauty standards. And it\u2019s making her sad!

Some students let it roll off (as far as I can tell by not giving an outward reaction), but a lot of the girls have cried and I\u2019ve spent many days comforting them the best I can (I\u2019m white and I feel I cannot relate in a way that truly reaches their feelings). \n\nHowever, my son, who\u2019s 11, finally just got over his latest \u201cbody issue\u201d of wanting me to either wax, shave off, or dye his arm hair.

I spoke often with him in this latest issue to get him through it, I compromised and said since it\u2019s winter right now with long sleeves that he give it until short sleeve season to think it over, then we\u2019d find a solution. \n\nWe are white, his arm hair is barely a dark blonde, hardly noticeable. \n\nBut it\u2019s his body, so mostly he calls the shots. \n\nBy the time spring came, he was suddenly over it and is now concentrating on random zits and his toe nails. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Cool, you can argue that.

Some ppl don\u2019t get a lot of unwanted body hair until menopause. Some get it younger. \n\nIf there are safety concerns in terms of razors or products, that\u2019s one thing. If this were something that would potentially damage her skin, that\u2019d be another. You can\u2019t even make the argument that there is anything inherently and inappropriately sexual about removing eyebrows and lip hair. \n\nWhen is this magic age where she will be allowed to remove unwanted body hair?
