My 10yo daughter has a light unibrow. A year ago she started saying kids were making fun of it and she wanted it gone. After making sure SHE was sure, and letting her know plucking hurts, she finally convinced me that she really wanted it. It grows back quick, I only do it when she brings it up to me(when it bothers her). If you're sister is that uncomfortable, she may be getting bullied for it. I did also tell my kid that most women have mustaches that they bleach, shave, or wax, so she didn't feel too bad about her brows", "NTA. Doesn't matter what your mom thinks. If your little sister wants it off, she should have the autonomy to do so. 14 is plenty old to be making decisions about your own appearance. But she should be aware that having it is not an issue. She should be removing it because she wants to,  not because she feels pressured by beauty standards.", "NTA - I got bullied soooo bad her age for facial hair. This would help with that, although with these emotionally abusive parents I'm not sure her mental health will fair well anyway...", "NTA - it\u2019s cruel to not allow your sister to remove her facial hair if that\u2019s what she wants.", "NTA\n\nIf adult females are allowed to shave or remove body hair, then are THEY saying that 'body hair isn't ok'?  Why is it different if someone younger does it?  This seems hypocritical and lacking in logic at the least.\n\nIf it was a religious or philosophical principle (ie you NEVER got rid of the hair) then I could understand it.  But, this is not a hill to die on.  She is becoming a young woman and may notice that others around her do not have as much hair, she may even have had others draw attention to it.  You as an older woman were introducing her to her basic feminine ways.\n\nShe does live with your parents and thus has to be subject to the rules of their house.  I'm sorry that they reacted like they did.  In a calmer moment, I would ask your Mom, what precisely is her objection to the removal of hair, given that it causes your Sister anxiety?", "NTA. Your sister asked you for it and it bothers her, and you helped.", "I would say NTA. When I was younger I would always, always get bullied for the hair. I'm Hungarian so we got the thick hair. I had leg hair from when I was 11 and my parents would never let me do anything about it until I was 15. But of by that time the damage was done. \n\nI was so self conscious about it, I wished I had a sister like you. Because how it worked for me if I was actually allowed to do something about it to stop the bullying, then I still probably wouldn't be so self conscious. \n\nI've done a lot of work on myself, and the fact that I'm still so adamant and self conscious about the hair is because my inner child is still so hurt and wounded from it. Am I trying to work on it, yes. But if I was allowed to do something about it to not get bullied, I know as an adult I wouldn't actually give two shits. \n\nI understand that it might be a culture thing, but your sister was pleading for help. She's probably hurting inside just like I was so your parents ignoring that? Not okay. I hope you're able to open their eyes a bit to see that they are neglecting their child. \n\nOr at the very least, get them to explain why they have such issues with it. Then your little sister can understand why and maybe she can at least defend herself against the bullies. (If there are any, I'm assuming yes because kids are jerks and that's how most female children are treated on topics like these.) \n\nWe need to build up self confidence, which is really hard when the people you spend mass majority of your day with beat you down. \n\nHair grows back, always does. So protect your peace and don't get trauma bonded to the shame of having hair, if that means we gotta do it to avoid the situations, then so be it. If there's an issue, then do what you need to to feel your peace. People don't tend to have a proper sense of self until even late 20s. We don't have good foundations to build on and we're still trying to figure out who we are. When we get pushed down it just makes it harder to find who we are.\n\nWhen we do have the sturdy sense of self though, it's a lot easier to no longer give a **** about what others say about/to you. \n\nDon't know if that made sense, but that's my view point of it. Synopsis for action would be I'd highly highly suggest properly sitting down with your parents and try to have a healthy talk with them as well as a talk with your sister.\n\nI'd talk to your sister first, ask her why she feels so uncomfortable with the hair, get her to actually explain it. If there's bullies or something of that sort. Go from there. If it is something to do with bullies or something of the sort, then talk with your parents. Don't start off with what your sister said, see their side first to avoid bringing up defenses.\n\nJust say, hey I know I ended up stepping on your toes with this situation. I'd really like to properly understand where this rule is coming from so that I know in the future. Can we do that? \n\nThen hopefully once they explain it then you can slid in and explain possibly how your sister is feeling. Open their eyes to her side. \n\nIf they refuse, well sadly there's not a whole lot you can do except be there for your sister and support her because she ain't getting the support she needs from your parents. It's lonely not having your family be there yet not. \n\nSo do your best, I hope you the best and you're a wonderful older sister.

Of course it\u2019s important to teach kids to not care so much abt others\u2019 opinions on how you look, it\u2019s still important to take into consideration the fact that bullying in school can be detrimental. One remark abt body hair in middle school is enough to make someone insecure abt it for decades", "I mean, 14 years old is literally legally old enough to make medical decisions independently so long as you have demonstrated maturity and understanding. So really I'd argue that it's actually not the parents' place to enforce these kind of rules on what their 14 year old does with her body, given that the changes she wants to make are completely reversible.", "As an older sister, I\u2019m sure you know that for a lot of body stuff, the only way to be comfortable with your body/ comfortable not adhering to beauty standards can be to just\u2026 grow past it.

And it was a way for me to tell her that women do get hair on their faces, she just doesn't know or because women will sometimes hide it. My friends and I even joke about how we get rid of them. Of course if she gets one(which is likely given genes) I'm hoping he hair is light enough it's not noticeable. I also told her that sometimes when a woman is old enough, they can get chin hairs. I told her when I was younger I picked my eyebrows really thin because they were like caterpillars and I was embarrassed, but how I wish I hadn't because now it doesn't grow back every here and there. And that facial hair on a girl/woman is fine as long as THEY are fine with it. I also told her she's beautiful the way she is, but she was extremely bothered by it so I gave her relief. I'm all about body positivity for her because I have really bad body dysmorphia and I don't want that for her.", "Visibility of facial hair and how people feel about it is pretty dependent on what part of the world you\u2019re in. I\u2019ve lived in countries where every woman I knew owned a small razor to remove eyebrow and hairline hair.

Like. My mom was the same way and after the fact, like 5 years later her only reasoning to not let me shave was that she didn\u2019t want to buy the razors. Waxing can be expensive if you get someone to do it and borderline dangerous if done yourself, so I get that. Dying can be difficult to do as well, and can damage the skin if done incorrectly and of course the fumes. But why not hand over a razor? It\u2019s not hard to shave, and you could supervise and take the razor back after if you have any self harm concerns. (Which is the rare valid reason to not let people shave) When your son gets to the age where he grows facial hair, if he isn\u2019t already, are you going to let him shave? My mother made me go around with the worst neckbeard because again, she didn\u2019t want to buy me razors.

Maybe it came through that way in text!  I live in Michigan, so I guess yeah, it would depend on where someone lives!  Honestly, I didn't even start doing anything with mine until about 10 years ago. After I had my daughter I developed a hormonal dark spot before my nose that had taken 2 years to lighten up with product, and I would have to shave it to basically help remove skin layers(I don't know how to describe it honestly, but the product was like a chemical peel as well). Anyways, when it went away, I just ended up keeping the habit of doing it like once a month. But yes, every female I know lightens it or gets rid of it.

I wish I had an older sister like you. \n\nYou gave your sister something your mom did not. You gave her autonomy and helped build her confidence. You didn't tell her body hair was gross and women shouldn't have it, you allowed her to decide if she wants facial/body hair, by doing so she was given the confidence to do something for herself.\n\n I would tell your sister that body hair is natural and ok to have, but it is also perfectly ok to choose to remove it/maintain it as well. Your sister is entering in to a challenging age and having someone older but closer her age she can trust and talk to about these things will greatly benefit her. Moms arent always right and most moms mean their best, but we don't always see things the way our children do and when that happens it's great for our children to have some slightly older that understands their perspective and aid them in achieving what is best for them.

I feel so badly for people that have dark facial hair on their face. Nothing wrong if they decide to keep it or whatever but there is nothing wrong with getting rid of it either.
