{"id": 615, "submission_id": "yh8pm8", "title": "AITA for not agreeing to be involved in my sister's social circle?", "selftext": "I (24 F) got in a very explosive nasty fight with my sister (31) about this.\nWe come from a severely dysfunctional family that has left us with the expected trauma. I've become very introverted as a result and struggle with a lot of social anxiety. I recognize it's something that I need to work on however I'm just not ready to play the perfect hostess for my sister whenever she wants me to. Especially when all her coworkers are women much older than me. For some reason she is very gung-ho about me meeting them despite the fact I always tell her I don't want to. I don't have the situational know-how, the tactful conversation skills or the social battery to keep up with 40 year old married women with children. It's just very uncomfortable for me especially when she tells me they are very judgemental who even backbite and spread rumours about other coworkers that has even cost some their jobs.\n\nSo, in addition to the social anxiety, I am nervous. I don't want to risk her work relationships with my awkward mouth and it doesn't help when my sister herself insults me later. She has the habit of recounting anything dumb or awkward I said and complain why I said whatever I said. It's always such a mental strain interacting with her friend group because of the repercussions I could face for any poor wording. So to avoid all the potential mess I might bring I told her it's easier if she simply does not involve me at all with her colleagues. I don't involve her in my (admittedly small) friend circle and It feels like she's pressurizing me to act the way she wants. I'm not comfortable about any of it.\n\nShe exploded, called me abnormal and many other hurtful things. She told me I'm just justifying my introverted tendencies although I was just trying to explain my stance. Further went on and called me a basket case for being unable to stop myself from crying during arguments, the only help she extented about it was to tell me to \" just stop.\" Called me overly sensitive And mimicked my crying in a mock. I understand she wants me to learn to be more social but I don't see this being the way to do it.\nI also got heated at the constant invalidation and told her to forget about ever expecting me to indulge her requests or entertaining her friends. Those are my boundaries and I won't be emotionally blackmailed into bending them.\nShe told me that she should stop calling me her sister since I don't even know how to talk normally with people and she can't rely on me for social interactions.\nSo apparently being a sister comes with conditions that I don\u2019t meet. The conversation just devolved into more toxicity and Unsurprisingly, we have stopped speaking to each other.\nI can't help but resent her. If I don't do what she wants, I'm not worth being called family. And I'm so confused. Is asking to be left alone really such an offense? \nAita for just wanting to come out my shell in due time and not through forced interactions with people not even my age I don't relate to?", "created_utc": 1667117518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh8pm8/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_be_involved_in_my/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her requests make no sense. Why does she want you hang out with them so much?\n\nNTA", "NTA. You sound like you\u2019re doing great. Your sister sounds like she needs serious therapy. Keep those boundaries up and do what is best for *you*.", "NTA. It is super bizarre for me that she is pushing this so hard. Forget the social anxiety, I don\u2019t know what 24 year old would enjoy the thought of hanging out with a bunch of 40 year old marrieds with kids. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have. And I don\u2019t blame you at all for having anxiety at the thought of socialising with them. She has no right to dictate who your friends are. If she really cares about your social life, she should be encouraging you to go to therapy to work through your issues, and encouraging you to get out and make your own friends your age.", "NTA, it's her social circle and not yours for a reason. You don't have anything to do with those people and if you don't want to interact with them you don't have to, no matter what your sister thinks. She wants to control her life so bad that she doesn't see the line she crosses with your boundaries. My sister is exactly the same, always wants to have her way, if she doesn't get it, she insults, throws tamper tantrums, or ignores the person until she gets what she wants.\n\nOne time (about 5 years ago) I told her firmly to stay out of my decisions for my life, that she can't control what I do or how I act, that it's none of her business. From that day on she has blocked me everywhere and never spoke to me again. Even when our parents celebrated their accomplishments, she couldn't just forget the fight for one day and stay civil, she made a huge scene and left every time I was there.\nIt hurt my parents bad, yes. But I can tell you I live so much more comfortable now, that I can express myself as I am and not how she wants me to be (like your sister wants you to be extroverted, mine wants that for me too).\nIf it is possible for you, I would recommend lowering your contact with your sister, for your own mental wellbeing.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to attend social situations with your sister's coworkers. That is absurd.", "NTA\n\nIf I were you I'd consider staying the f away for your sister, she is clearly insensitive and she's straight up abusing you\n\nshe doesn't deserve to be your sister and you deserve a better family \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, and it sounds like your sister is toxic af. Even family can be cut out, I've gone no contact with my brother because everytime were together he just constantly takes pops at me making me look bad Infront of his mates just so he looks a better person. So I stopped going, apparently I'm the bad brother because I don't want to be his verbal punch bag Infront of his pals. I'm guessing your sister is pretty much the same. Cut her out, stay civil when you see her at family events and don't rise to her shit. Ignore it has hard as that can be, I just say ok to every insult now and walk away.....\n\nI'm talking from experience and in the end you enjoy the peace. Don't ever let nobody force you into situations you don't want to be in......\n\nAnd just for the record..... Who in the right mind would want to hang out around people who gossip to get people fired. Why would anyone want to put themselves in that nuclear toxic circle? ...... You did the right thing in my opinion, if you want to sort it out then write down the exact reasons in a letter then give it her and say only respond with a letter this way the opportunity to shout is gone and you both get time to think before you write. But be totally honest", "NTA. My sister and I have our own social circles and though yes we are welcomed in both I would not force her into mine if she didn't want to and vice versa. Your sister wants to fit in and expects you to do that for her at the cost of your own well being. That's not what sisters do.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to justify your introverted tendencies but you do have to honour them, and your sister is refusing to do that.\n\nIt sounds like she herself is somewhat shy and insecure (even if she appears extrovert) and is struggling to set boundaries and form healthy friendships. I would guess she wants you to be present as kind of backup or to increase her standing or weight in discussions because she isn\u2019t feeling confident to socialise on her own, and is resentful when you choose to respect your own need for space because she doesn\u2019t have the skills or courage to do that for herself.", "NTA. Your sister is just mad that you're not going to be her good little slave. How did she trick you into service? Did she hypnotize you? Were you under duress? I can tell that you're a doormat person. Just let people bully and walk all over you. It sounds like you're not a victim.

Even without your trauma which you acknowledged, it would be understandable not want to meet them \n\nPut it plainly to your sister. She goes out of your way to tell you these are gossip mongering, judgemental vipers and then acts surprised you don't want to be involved? Your sister can catch a friggin grip. It's like saying this ice cream tastes like shit, ya wanna bite?", "NTA for all the obvious reasons everyone else already said. \n\n I initially wrote a lengthy post criticizing this question, but that was too much negativity for me. Still i think its worth pointing out some of these points.  The question is very simple considering the length of the post. Most of the description is irrelevant or speaks to OP's character, but really the rule is: you dont have to do things you dont want to do, if there is no obligation to.  Here you have no obligation to hang out with your sister's social group so its an ez NTA judgement.  Yet the post goes on and on about social anxiety or trauma, or emotional blackmail. girl please. I get it, you feel shitty and uncertain about the situation even if it isnt your \"fault\", but you should talk to someone instead of writing out this super long self-gratifying post trying to farm internet sympathy. Its not a question for AITA. its a question for a friend, trusted person, or therapist. Using reddit for that role can have wildly different results.\n\nI was 24 once and i was a socially awkward idiot. But i did as most do and just kept on living until one day I looked back and realized how much I've learned and how far I've come. Then I looked forward and realized how much I still have to go. And in that moment i learned what true regret was, but also what it meant to have hope for the future. It was the day i became a true adult.  I think OP is doing fine or on the path to be fine.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine not to hang out with your sister's coworkers.", "NTA sis is", "NTA your sister is a bully who doesn\u2019t/won\u2019t accept you as you are. I have a sister like that, if I\u2019m  not doing everything her way in her mind I\u2019m just wrong, and she tries to force me to do everything her way. People like that don\u2019t change. It\u2019s probably better to limit your interactions.", "Nta your sister is a bully", "She says she feels like the odd one out since all her colleagues have families that drop in for pleasantries when they ask them to and I'm cruel and insensitive to not behave like a normal family member for her.", "Tbf we both need the therapy lol. But I'll try to keep your words in mind.", "Omg. That's so sad to hear you and your parents had to go through that. but I'm glad to hear at least you're in a happier mental frame, I hope your parents grow to not feel too hurt about her outbursts anymore as well.\nYes, With the way things are going I have a feeling I'll have to take your recommendation into action sooner or later.", "Well, ig it's good to know the draining experience provided someone some type of amusement at least.\nShe's my older sister and I do love her. There was a time when We had no one else but each other. I have a lot to be thankful to her for. She was my best friend.\nI don't really believe I'm a \"victim\" anyway. In a weird and hurful situation atm but I'm not a victim. I just wanted to do the right thing. Get an impartial 3rd person view. Get some ideas on what to do.\nThank you for your input though ig.", "Tbh i didn't see it like self gratifying? But ig i see how it could look that way.\nIt's also not an easy \"nta\" for me because I've heard on plenty of days on end abt how much of an a-hole I am for not involving myself or trying to be sociable for my sister's sake. I didn\u2019t come from this \"easy\" as you say, doctrine about not having to do something you don't want to. Sacrifice and doing what you're told was more in vogue where I'm from.\nBoundaries was something I learned much later and am still learning. I'm still not entirely sure what's okay.\nI'm actually genuinely at a loss here.\nThis is my first reddit post and I copied the format of others I've heard or seen \ud83d\udc80 I guess I did a poor attempt at the copy. Tbh I thought it's supposed to be lengthy or my question might get over looked or unposted \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\nI suppose there definitely must be unnecessary babbling in there but in my mind I was trying my best to give people a clear picture about what happened and what I wanted to say.\nI agree i should speak to my therapist about it. The next sesh is in a while, will definitely have to babble to her about it too. Was really torn atm and the anonymity of the famous reddit pulled me in. \nBut thanks. I didn\u2019t think it could be seen in this light. Good to know where I fell short.", "Well now she won't have to. She did threaten to just not call you her sister so now she can push through with her own threat", "Ah hahahaha! That's hilarious. The colleagues that backstab and gossip and will outright cost someone their job? That's normal for her. Sounds like she has replaced her dysfunctional family of origin with a dysfunctional family of choice. Also sounds like she fits right in with them.\n\nYou on the other hand, you aren't seeking a new dysfunctional family. And the wonderful thing about families of choice? It's the choice-part. You get to choose who you let into your life.\n\nYour sister has made her choice. Her choices don't obligate you.", "Oh so her insecurities are totally normal, but yours are not\u2026. She is an AH and a big hypocrite\n\nNo one has to learn to be less introverted, there is nothing wrong with being introverted\n\nWould it be a good thing to get therapy to heal from your toxic childhood.. absolutely, but not as some goal to become extroverted so she can show her family off \n\nShe is just perpetuating the toxicity and needs therapy for that", "I know the feeling but I actually kicked my sister out and went no contact. I love my sister too and all we had growing up in foster homes was each other but I'm still not her doormat to let her walk all over me any which way she pleases. Of course, you're not a victim.

Idek. I just don't get it...", "Idk if I'm already defensive from the 4 hour argument I've just had or you're trying to rile me up to show some backbone.\nbut whichever one it is,\nit's working XD\nI was firm before about not doing what she wants me to do if it's uncomfortable. I'm resolute and as set in steel as Colossus's d*ck now about it.\nUnironically, Thank you for your infuriating response and the unfair psychoanalysis lol", "I understand. The good thing is, you don't need to get it. Those are her choices and preferences, and it's her potential headache down the line. \n\nAs much as I find it interesting and fascinating to try to understand why people do what they do, sometimes there's just no understanding it and I can just observe and decide whether I want to be around for it.", "My work here is done. I just wanted to help you find that energy. Now you have it. It's there. Just need to use it. I'm on your side here. I want you to not get bullied. Especially by family."]}
