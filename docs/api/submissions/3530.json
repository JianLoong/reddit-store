She used one of my grandfather\u2019s (My mom\u2019s Dad) middle name as his first name and picked a new non-family middle name agreed upon by her and her boyfriend. \n\nMy sister is done having kids. She is one and done. 100% never having another kid. She has been adamant about it ever since. \n\nI am currently 5 months pregnant with my first baby, also a boy. When my husband and I found out we were having a boy the first name was a no brainer, Milo (non-family name). It holds a lot of meaning between my husband and I. Now we had to come up with a middle name. We spent a long time trying to find one we liked. We knew we wanted a family name of some sort. So we tried out a few from both sides, but ultimately landed on my Dad\u2019s stepdad\u2019s middle name, Dawson. \n\n(Just some background, my Dad\u2019s bio-dad was kind of a POS. I never knew him I only ever knew my \u201cstep-grandfather\u201d. I hate calling him \u201cstep\u201d because he was very much my grandpa in every sense of the word.)\n\nDawson was one of the family names that my sister picked out those 15+ years ago and didn\u2019t use when her son was born. I told her that we were toying around with Dawson before we permanently decided on it and she kind of just shrugged it off. Once we made the final choice, she blew a gasket. \n\nShe told me that I didn\u2019t look hard enough for a another middle name and that I didn\u2019t try to talk my husband out of picking the name Dawson. She took it personally, like I chose the name to hurt her. She was also upset that I didn\u2019t take the middle name she wanted for my son, and that once again, I was picking someone else over her. \n\nAfter we got into a fight about the name she, again, brought up that she is never going to have another kid and that she has months until my son is born to make peace with the fact that I chose that middle name. But she still brings up the fact that I stole the name from her. \n\nAITA for picking Dawson even though she picked that name to use but didn\u2019t use it when her son was born and is 100% done having kids?", "created_utc": 1669745037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8170w/aita_for_not_picking_a_different_middle_name_for/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
