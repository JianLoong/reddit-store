If he just put it on on his own without asking, you're N-T-A. If he asked you and you said yes and the two of you sat down to watch the movie but then you pulled out your laptop, Y-T-A.", "YTA\nJust communicate that you still have work to do. That you told him days ago doesnt mean you are still not finished. Don\u2019t just agree on spending time with him when you do not have time. Just pulling out the laptop is disrespectful. Set your boundaries how you like them but talk about it. You seem stressed. Thats a normal thing but don\u2019t take it out on him.", "YTA couldn\u2019t you have done it before or after the movie? why did you have to do it during the movie?", "Going for YTA, not at all for prioritising the work, but for how you communicated it.\n\nYou should have either let him know in advance that you didnt have time for a full movie, or at least not immediately be defensive when he was asking why you pulled it out in the middle of an activity together. If my partner suddenly dropped attention in an activity together, I would ask the question as well. I think a lot here is communication. Not saying it is impossible to multitask this, but at least like give him context in a non-defensive way when you do so without notice.\n\nFrom the story it at least sounds he isn't irritated that you have to put time in work, but rather how you handled it and immediately went defensive for a reasonable question.", "YTA. You asked if he wanted to watch a movie, then went to work mode halfway through and overreacted when he pointed it out.\nIf you are not done with work, just say so beforehand.", "YTA, yea you overreacted for sure. I mean, idk how the rest of the argument unfolded, but him just saying \"hey, what's up, I thought we were xyz\" and you immediately getting on the defensive and turning a rational concern into a big thing is ....kinda immature. Now, I'm guessing there are other elements at play and maybe there's been more lead up to the whole thing but...as an isolated incident it sounds like he was just expressing a concern and you got overly sensitive right off the bat. Also it's a couple days before Christmas, so to me it's pretty fair to not want you focused elsewhere, and unless he didn't breach his feelings appropriately, which it kinda sounds like he did....yea sorry op..\nAlso it's fair for you to address you need to set boundaries with your time, so...set a goddamn boundary. Either watch the movie with him or say \"hey I don't really have time for this right now, can you give me a half hour to finish this thing?\". What you did is the opposite of setting time boundaries. It's trying to do both at once, and then getting upset when you're mildly and calmly called out on it...? YTA, all day", "YTA. just wait until the movie is done.", "YTA fill out the forms before the movie or tell your boyfriend \u201cwe can watch a movie but I have to fill out these forms while we watch.\u201d If you communicated what you needed to do first, then you are setting expectations. If I\u2019m watching a movie with my SO as quality time and he pulls out his computer, I probably would ask \u201caren\u2019t we watching a movie?\u201d It would be on my boyfriend to let me know whatever deadlines he had without being defensive or rude about it.", "NTA for pulling the computer out. YTA for turning a fair question into a big argument. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry but this job application is really wearing on me and I\u2019m having trouble getting into the movie because of it. I want to be able to enjoy the game tomorrow so I was trying to multitask. Can we finish the movie another time?\u201d \nSome people (myself included) think movie time at home should be like movie time in the theater. Put the phone and computer down and enjoy. But A) that\u2019s not realistic and B) the majority of times you can pause the movie and come back to it if something comes up.\nSo I get why he asked the question, and I also hope he would have understood if you had explained it calmly instead of being set off as you said.", "YTA huge over reaction. Either wait until the movie is over, or explain that you somehow had forgotten to finish this very important paper work for your dream job. Not sure how you forgot if it\u2019s so important, but yes you over reacted.", "Yeah... YTA", "YTA", "Okay. Personally I don't think taking out your laptop is a big deal. My wife and I watch movies and do other things (play on our phones or knit or write) all the time. To us, quality time is being able to sit down and enjoy something together. \n\nBut yikes you waaaaaaaaay overreacted. All he did was ask a question. YTA", "YTA for being rude. It\u2019s plain rude to work on your laptop during a movie together. If you needed to work, you should\u2019ve just said you don\u2019t have time to watch a movie with him. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "You have to see how that would make him feel like you weren't interested. If you had things to do, you could have done that first, then watched the movie.", "YTA - per your comments, it was your idea to watch a movie and spend that time together. Days earlier, you mentioned the need for more self-care, which to most people means unplugging and relaxing\u2014not working in your down time. Then, you abruptly decided to pull out your laptop and do work, and when he asked about it, you got mad at him. \n\nSounds like you already knew what you were doing was rude, and that\u2019s why you immediately got defensive.", "Not enough INFO here to really judge the fine line of reaction. But I am leaning towards YTA for starting to watch the movie with him and then switching to work midway. Also for being so touchy (with no reason given for it here). He just said he thought you were watching a movie together and instead of saying something like: \"I know, sorry. Gotta get this stuff done...\" You made a fuss out of it. If work is more important to you than spending time with him then that's your choice but be honest about it.", "YTA. It's incredibly rude, if you're doing something with someone, to just suddenly pull out your laptop, especially if you're doing it together. If he was reading with a movie in the background sure, but this is essentially the equivalent of pulling your laptop out in the middle of a romantic date and ignoring your partner for half an hour while they eat. Sure you're taking a bit here and there so you're 'multitasking' but you're not a very good date.\n\nThat said, that's a minor thing. You could've easily said 'I just realised I have important work to do, can we finish the movie later?'. That would've been fine. Instead you got defensive when he quite correctly was bothered about how rude you were. You could easily have communicated like an adult and instead you escalated, and now here you are.\n\nAlso you can't just call everything 'setting boundaries.' Your boundaries were just 'I'm going to not prioritise you because I have more important things.' Maybe you don't have time for a boyfriend right now?", "ESH\n\n>We were supposed to go to an NFL game tomorrow for Christmas and this turned into such a bad argument that he left and I think we will be breaking up.\n\nI mean, clearly y\u2019all had bigger problems.  But yeah, I\u2019d think it rude if I was spending time watching a movie with my SO and they all of a sudden decided it wasn\u2019t important to do that and they were going to fill out paperwork instead.\n\nIf the paperwork was so important, then you should have done that *before* you agreed to watch the movie.  And if you forgot (it happens), then you should have apologized, told your BF that you\u2019re sorry but you forgot about this really important paperwork that just HAD to be completed in the next hour.\n\nI mean, I assume it was that time-sensitive, right?  That it had to be completed and sent within the next couple of hours?  Otherwise, I\u2019m not sure why you had to do it during the middle of the movie and not at the end.", "YTA even though I am a fan of mullitasking myself. It would be ok to use your words and say: babe, I didn't have time to finish it, let me just do it while we are watching, it will take like 15 minutes and it's purely mechanical job, won't really distract me. Then, if he got angry, he would be the asshole.", "YTA. Just do it before the movie or if you just remembered / found out that you have to do it apologize and ask to pause the movie. Or wait until after the movie if it's not urgent. You don't have to do anything differently when it comes to your actions, just add some common courtesy.\n\nThis is as rude as walking out in the middle of someone's sentence and then attacking them for being weirded out by it because you needed to pick your kid up from daycare, and do they want to be prioritized over your kid?! No, they just want a curteous \"Sorry, I have some errands to run, can we finish this conversation later?\" before you storm out.\n\nIn the same way, your SO just wants \"Sorry, I know I suggested the movie, but I just remembered I needed to fill out some forms for my new job application. Can we take a break while I do it?\" He could've used the bathroom or made you two some snacks or whatever while you did it and then you could've continued your activity together with the full attention of both parties.", "I think a bit of both. NTA for pulling out your laptop to do important work that means a lot to you. \nYTA for losing it on him over his comment. It sounds like either you're super stressed and took it out on him, or this has been building in you for a bit and his remark was the straw that broke the camels back. You should have expressed whatever feelings you had in a better way.", "Slight ESH.  There are people who want to watch the movie together - and only the movie.  There are people Who say, yes let\u2019s watch the movie and I can do some other stuff at the same time.\n\n\nThe first group will always feel insulted/disrespected because they think it means you don\u2019t really want to spend time with them.   \n\n\nInstead, you need to say no I can\u2019t watch the movie now because I have to do these forms.", "Ish-There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to get some task done but you could of reacted in a different way.  Setting boundaries is about communication. You could say \u201cI want to be 100% present with you and I won\u2019t be able to until I\u2019ve completed this task.\u201d The goal is to slow down and think before reacting. It will take time and practice.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with sitting in bed and multi-tasking. The movie clearly wasn\u2019t holding your attention.", "NTA. Sounds like BF is being a little selfish.  Why would he demand that you watch a movie when he knows that the paperwork for your dream job needs to be completed?  If you are breaking up, you would be free to find someone a bit more understanding and a bit more sharing.  Merry Christmas.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why unless you are in a movie theatre you would need to give a movie your undivided attention.

God forbid the poor people who end up dating you, lollzz", "If the movie wasn't a priority to you and instead you wanted to work then why did you agree to watching it in the first place?", "YTA you could have done the paperwork after the movie.

I did.  She'd already told her boyfriend that she had too much on her plate, and needed time to get shit done.  But I can understand why she agreed to watch the movie, or at least spend time with the boyfriend.  Boyfriends often react poorly when you hit them with \"I don't have time for you right now\".\n\nSo I suspect the OP was only with the boyfriend that night as she was (ironically) trying to avoid conflict.  Putting myself in that situation as the boyfriend.\n\nWe are watching movie.  Girlfriend pulls out laptop.  I ask her what she's doing.  She tells me she needs to complete paperwork for her new job.  How do I respond?  Without any thought really, I grab the remote and pause the movie...\n\nIt's obvious that what she's doing is more important than the movie, so I give her time to do her paperwork.  \n\nBut that's not what happened.

Acknowledge that and remember that if there\u2019s a moving forward as a couple.", "YTA for how you reacted. Look I get it I have ADHD and personally I find it hard to focus on a movie the whole time and will take out my phone however you need to communicate these things with your partner in a less assholy way. If you wanted to finish the paperwork you could have told them that and paused the movie.", "YTA. Let's look it at from your boyfriend's POV.\n\nYou just pulled out the laptop out of nowhere and disregarded the entire fact you both were supposed to be watching a movie together. This sounds like date night at home. Date night is supposed to be intimate times away from distractions to spend quality time with each other. Even if it's 'lounging around watching a movie casually' as put it. This intimate time with your partner.\n\nDream job or not, you have to be clear and communicate properly even when you have important things to do. If you simply planned ahead and told yoir boyfriend that you need to put a raincheck on movie night to complete forms, I'm sure he'd have understood.\n\nIn fact, if you hadn't been so defensive and started an argument in your reply to him, he may have understood even if you brought it up right in the middle of the movie. \"Omg babe, I totally forgot I was supposed to fill in these forms for *insert job*. I'm gonna be in so much trouble if I don't do these now. Can I please quickly pull out my laptop to finish it, or if you would prefer we can put a rain check on movie night. I'm so sorry, but I promise I will make it up to you\".\n\nYou see how meaningful communication literally changes the nature of the entire conversation? All you had to was be the bigger person, be proactive and be thoughtful of your partner's feelings when you are the one having to change plans.

You were inconsiderate, but the worst part of it really is just how hard you tried to vilify him over nothing and paint him out to be a bad boyfriend for daring to say anything, even though what he said wasn't an attack on you at all, it was just a simple question.  You then tried to use terms like boundaries, self care and being assertive to make yourself feel like you were in the right and if he upset you, then he must be bad because those are good words you've wrongly applied to your actions.

I think it's pretty sad.\n\nI think being on your phone/computer throughout a movie is similar.  It's time to spend with a friend/partner, not ignore them and the movie.

I would too.", "I believe in another comment she said she only remembered it at the last minute...but yeah many better ways to go about this.", "Tbh this could just be me but it depends on if it is like a new movie or a movie you have already seen because sometimes we have it on just to play kinda in the background and just passively watch it, me and my family do that when it is a movie we have seen a thousand times.
