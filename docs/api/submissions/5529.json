If he just put it on on his own without asking, you're N-T-A. If he asked you and you said yes and the two of you sat down to watch the movie but then you pulled out your laptop, Y-T-A.", "YTA\nJust communicate that you still have work to do. That you told him days ago doesnt mean you are still not finished. Don\u2019t just agree on spending time with him when you do not have time. Just pulling out the laptop is disrespectful. Set your boundaries how you like them but talk about it. You seem stressed. Thats a normal thing but don\u2019t take it out on him.", "YTA couldn\u2019t you have done it before or after the movie? why did you have to do it during the movie?", "Going for YTA, not at all for prioritising the work, but for how you communicated it.\n\nYou should have either let him know in advance that you didnt have time for a full movie, or at least not immediately be defensive when he was asking why you pulled it out in the middle of an activity together. If my partner suddenly dropped attention in an activity together, I would ask the question as well. I think a lot here is communication. Not saying it is impossible to multitask this, but at least like give him context in a non-defensive way when you do so without notice.\n\nFrom the story it at least sounds he isn't irritated that you have to put time in work, but rather how you handled it and immediately went defensive for a reasonable question.", "YTA. You asked if he wanted to watch a movie, then went to work mode halfway through and overreacted when he pointed it out.\nIf you are not done with work, just say so beforehand.", "YTA, yea you overreacted for sure. I mean, idk how the rest of the argument unfolded, but him just saying \"hey, what's up, I thought we were xyz\" and you immediately getting on the defensive and turning a rational concern into a big thing is ....kinda immature. Now, I'm guessing there are other elements at play and maybe there's been more lead up to the whole thing but...as an isolated incident it sounds like he was just expressing a concern and you got overly sensitive right off the bat. Also it's a couple days before Christmas, so to me it's pretty fair to not want you focused elsewhere, and unless he didn't breach his feelings appropriately, which it kinda sounds like he did....yea sorry op..\nAlso it's fair for you to address you need to set boundaries with your time, so...set a goddamn boundary. Either watch the movie with him or say \"hey I don't really have time for this right now, can you give me a half hour to finish this thing?\". What you did is the opposite of setting time boundaries. It's trying to do both at once, and then getting upset when you're mildly and calmly called out on it...? YTA, all day", "YTA. just wait until the movie is done.", "YTA fill out the forms before the movie or tell your boyfriend \u201cwe can watch a movie but I have to fill out these forms while we watch.\u201d If you communicated what you needed to do first, then you are setting expectations. If I\u2019m watching a movie with my SO as quality time and he pulls out his computer, I probably would ask \u201caren\u2019t we watching a movie?\u201d It would be on my boyfriend to let me know whatever deadlines he had without being defensive or rude about it.", "NTA for pulling the computer out. YTA for turning a fair question into a big argument. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry but this job application is really wearing on me and I\u2019m having trouble getting into the movie because of it. I want to be able to enjoy the game tomorrow so I was trying to multitask. Can we finish the movie another time?\u201d \nSome people (myself included) think movie time at home should be like movie time in the theater. Put the phone and computer down and enjoy. But A) that\u2019s not realistic and B) the majority of times you can pause the movie and come back to it if something comes up.\nSo I get why he asked the question, and I also hope he would have understood if you had explained it calmly instead of being set off as you said.", "YTA huge over reaction. Either wait until the movie is over, or explain that you somehow had forgotten to finish this very important paper work for your dream job. Not sure how you forgot if it\u2019s so important, but yes you over reacted.", "Yeah... YTA", "YTA", "Okay. Personally I don't think taking out your laptop is a big deal. My wife and I watch movies and do other things (play on our phones or knit or write) all the time. To us, quality time is being able to sit down and enjoy something together. \n\nBut yikes you waaaaaaaaay overreacted. All he did was ask a question. YTA", "YTA for being rude. It\u2019s plain rude to work on your laptop during a movie together. If you needed to work, you should\u2019ve just said you don\u2019t have time to watch a movie with him. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "You have to see how that would make him feel like you weren't interested. If you had things to do, you could have done that first, then watched the movie.", "YTA - per your comments, it was your idea to watch a movie and spend that time together. Days earlier, you mentioned the need for more self-care, which to most people means unplugging and relaxing\u2014not working in your down time. Then, you abruptly decided to pull out your laptop and do work, and when he asked about it, you got mad at him. \n\nSounds like you already knew what you were doing was rude, and that\u2019s why you immediately got defensive.", "Not enough INFO here to really judge the fine line of reaction. But I am leaning towards YTA for starting to watch the movie with him and then switching to work midway. Also for being so touchy (with no reason given for it here). He just said he thought you were watching a movie together and instead of saying something like: \"I know, sorry. Gotta get this stuff done...\" You made a fuss out of it. If work is more important to you than spending time with him then that's your choice but be honest about it.", "YTA. It's incredibly rude, if you're doing something with someone, to just suddenly pull out your laptop, especially if you're doing it together. If he was reading with a movie in the background sure, but this is essentially the equivalent of pulling your laptop out in the middle of a romantic date and ignoring your partner for half an hour while they eat. Sure you're taking a bit here and there so you're 'multitasking' but you're not a very good date.\n\nThat said, that's a minor thing. You could've easily said 'I just realised I have important work to do, can we finish the movie later?'. That would've been fine. Instead you got defensive when he quite correctly was bothered about how rude you were. You could easily have communicated like an adult and instead you escalated, and now here you are.\n\nAlso you can't just call everything 'setting boundaries.' Your boundaries were just 'I'm going to not prioritise you because I have more important things.' Maybe you don't have time for a boyfriend right now?", "ESH\n\n>We were supposed to go to an NFL game tomorrow for Christmas and this turned into such a bad argument that he left and I think we will be breaking up.\n\nI mean, clearly y\u2019all had bigger problems.  But yeah, I\u2019d think it rude if I was spending time watching a movie with my SO and they all of a sudden decided it wasn\u2019t important to do that and they were going to fill out paperwork instead.\n\nIf the paperwork was so important, then you should have done that *before* you agreed to watch the movie.  And if you forgot (it happens), then you should have apologized, told your BF that you\u2019re sorry but you forgot about this really important paperwork that just HAD to be completed in the next hour.\n\nI mean, I assume it was that time-sensitive, right?  That it had to be completed and sent within the next couple of hours?  Otherwise, I\u2019m not sure why you had to do it during the middle of the movie and not at the end.", "YTA even though I am a fan of mullitasking myself. It would be ok to use your words and say: babe, I didn't have time to finish it, let me just do it while we are watching, it will take like 15 minutes and it's purely mechanical job, won't really distract me. Then, if he got angry, he would be the asshole.", "YTA. Just do it before the movie or if you just remembered / found out that you have to do it apologize and ask to pause the movie. Or wait until after the movie if it's not urgent. You don't have to do anything differently when it comes to your actions, just add some common courtesy.\n\nThis is as rude as walking out in the middle of someone's sentence and then attacking them for being weirded out by it because you needed to pick your kid up from daycare, and do they want to be prioritized over your kid?! No, they just want a curteous \"Sorry, I have some errands to run, can we finish this conversation later?\" before you storm out.\n\nIn the same way, your SO just wants \"Sorry, I know I suggested the movie, but I just remembered I needed to fill out some forms for my new job application. Can we take a break while I do it?\" He could've used the bathroom or made you two some snacks or whatever while you did it and then you could've continued your activity together with the full attention of both parties.", "I think a bit of both. NTA for pulling out your laptop to do important work that means a lot to you. \nYTA for losing it on him over his comment. It sounds like either you're super stressed and took it out on him, or this has been building in you for a bit and his remark was the straw that broke the camels back. You should have expressed whatever feelings you had in a better way.", "Slight ESH.  There are people who want to watch the movie together - and only the movie.  There are people Who say, yes let\u2019s watch the movie and I can do some other stuff at the same time.\n\n\nThe first group will always feel insulted/disrespected because they think it means you don\u2019t really want to spend time with them.   \n\n\nInstead, you need to say no I can\u2019t watch the movie now because I have to do these forms.", "Ish-There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to get some task done but you could of reacted in a different way.  Setting boundaries is about communication. You could say \u201cI want to be 100% present with you and I won\u2019t be able to until I\u2019ve completed this task.\u201d The goal is to slow down and think before reacting. It will take time and practice.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with sitting in bed and multi-tasking. The movie clearly wasn\u2019t holding your attention.", "NTA. Sounds like BF is being a little selfish.  Why would he demand that you watch a movie when he knows that the paperwork for your dream job needs to be completed?  If you are breaking up, you would be free to find someone a bit more understanding and a bit more sharing.  Merry Christmas.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why unless you are in a movie theatre you would need to give a movie your undivided attention.

I did.  She'd already told her boyfriend that she had too much on her plate, and needed time to get shit done.  But I can understand why she agreed to watch the movie, or at least spend time with the boyfriend.  Boyfriends often react poorly when you hit them with \"I don't have time for you right now\".\n\nSo I suspect the OP was only with the boyfriend that night as she was (ironically) trying to avoid conflict.  Putting myself in that situation as the boyfriend.\n\nWe are watching movie.  Girlfriend pulls out laptop.  I ask her what she's doing.  She tells me she needs to complete paperwork for her new job.  How do I respond?  Without any thought really, I grab the remote and pause the movie...\n\nIt's obvious that what she's doing is more important than the movie, so I give her time to do her paperwork.  \n\nBut that's not what happened.

Look I get it I have ADHD and personally I find it hard to focus on a movie the whole time and will take out my phone however you need to communicate these things with your partner in a less assholy way. If you wanted to finish the paperwork you could have told them that and paused the movie.", "YTA. Let's look it at from your boyfriend's POV.\n\nYou just pulled out the laptop out of nowhere and disregarded the entire fact you both were supposed to be watching a movie together. This sounds like date night at home. Date night is supposed to be intimate times away from distractions to spend quality time with each other. Even if it's 'lounging around watching a movie casually' as put it. This intimate time with your partner.\n\nDream job or not, you have to be clear and communicate properly even when you have important things to do. If you simply planned ahead and told yoir boyfriend that you need to put a raincheck on movie night to complete forms, I'm sure he'd have understood.\n\nIn fact, if you hadn't been so defensive and started an argument in your reply to him, he may have understood even if you brought it up right in the middle of the movie. \"Omg babe, I totally forgot I was supposed to fill in these forms for *insert job*. I'm gonna be in so much trouble if I don't do these now. Can I please quickly pull out my laptop to finish it, or if you would prefer we can put a rain check on movie night. I'm so sorry, but I promise I will make it up to you\".\n\nYou see how meaningful communication literally changes the nature of the entire conversation? All you had to was be the bigger person, be proactive and be thoughtful of your partner's feelings when you are the one having to change plans.

The boundary should be work should either come first or wait until *after* the relaxation period.", "NTA multitasking during a Christmas movie should not be this big of a deal", "This was really rude and disrespectful. I often wonder, reading stuff here, how many of these problems could be mitigated, if not resolved, by just some basic politeness. It's rude to stare over someone's head when they are talking to you, rude to stare at your phone in company, rude to pull out a laptop for work when you've committed to some rec time with a partner. At the risk of sounding like a scold, it does seem that a lot of people could use a refresher on this basic level of social interaction. So yes, YTA. But if you and your bf are breaking up over this, you've got a lot more problems than your lack of manners.", "It sounds like the relationship was on the rocks to begin with. Maybe this was for the best", "NTA, we regularly have our phones oe computers out while we're watching a movie. Just watching a movie and doing nothing else is hella boring. And if you had something important to do it makes you even less the AH.", "What about \u201cCan we please, watch this later? I want to get something done asap as I want ti get it out my mind\u201d. Learn to Comunicate!!!!!!!!", "YTA. Why did you agree to watch a movie if you had work to do? If it's a couple activity, it's rude to disengage in the middle of it without acknowledging what you're doing.", "YTA. You should have at least mentioned that before the movie starts you had to do some quick paperwork. Or just told him that you would do both. Just opening and beginning was rude.", "YTA\n\nYou could have used your words as you did here, to say you remembered you had stuff to do.", "ESH.\nAll this takes is some clear communication imo", "YTA. \nLiterally all boils down to communication. Express how you want to watch the movie but you just remembered that paperwork. Say hey can we take 10 minutes so I can finish it and then we can unpause? Sorry babe, I just know I won\u2019t be able to focus on the movie if I\u2019m thinking about this paperwork! Easy, done, no bullshit, all understanding. \n\nBut it does seem like you don\u2019t want to communicate with him anymore. You say, here we go again!, so if you feel like all he does is criticize, then you should let go.", "YTA- he wanted to spend quality time with you and you made it clear to him that it was not important to you. talk, speak. you could have said \"hey it slipped my mind but i really need to do this just quick so i do not forget can we pause the film, i want to give the film and you full attention but this will be distracting me the entire time\"", "YTA- You should of communicated with your boyfriend if it had to he done right then and there. It was your idea to watch the movie in the first place.", "YTA. Your lack of time management is not his problem. You could have done the forms before you started the movie, or waited until the end. Or if you absolutely had to do them that very moment, asked him to pause the movie for a bit.", "NTA - how is 5 minutes doing something on your laptop a big deal? To finish up work?", "Or just tell him \u201cHey, I need to fill out these forms, I\u2019m going to get my laptop\u201d and he really shouldn\u2019t make it a huge thing if it\u2019s for a new job, but OP seems to be thinking he\u2019d read her mind and just started doing something else randomly. If they spend a lot of time together, I think he should be okay with her having her laptop maybe be it was bizarre the way OP made it all about some larger frustrations and didn\u2019t communicate at all.", "Based on her history it seems the issues are more than just this. It seems like you guys need to sit down have a damn conversation about your lives and communication because your sex life is apparently terrible, you're switching around on medications which alone is going to cause issue, but it just all around seems like there's issues between you guys that you aren't discussing.\n\n\n\nBut yes, YTA. I get that you realized that you had to finish something made movie but you're the one who suggested the movie and wanted to do it. Then pulled out a laptop to work on something mid movie with your partner. Its just plain rude and makes it seem like you don't even care to be spending time with them.", "Based on her history it seems the issues are more than just this. It seems like you guys need to sit down have a damn conversation about your lives and communication because your sex life is apparently terrible, you're switching around on medications which alone is going to cause issue, but it just all around seems like there's issues between you guys that you aren't discussing.", "This is stupid. She is talking about her future, her career, he could be a little more supportive.", ">You could've easily said 'I just realised I have important work to do, can we finish the movie later?' That would've been fine.\n\nIt would have been tolerable,  what would have been fine is saying beforee the movie started,  \"hey I just need to get these forms for the new job done first,  can you wait 20 minutes\"", "She was the one who asked if he wanted to watch the movie", "They\u2019re not TA for wanting to finish up work, they\u2019re the clear AH here bc they don\u2019t communicate and then respond RUDELY to a simple question (that didn\u2019t sound malicious/rude in any way). ALSO let\u2019s not forget OP wad the one who suggested the movie to begin with!", "Right like idk why the top comments are Op is the asshole. If you\u2019re watching something you can easily multi task. Plenty of people do it on the daily.", "OP suggested to watch the movie which means they asked BF if he wanted to watch a movie with them, and then decided halfway through that 'Oh I should pull out a laptop and do some work' which fun fact- it's distracting. I multitask during movies at home, by myself even, but if I watch a movie with someone else, and I hear the tiny click clacks of their keyboard and the glow of their screen while we're supposed to be watching a film together? No bueno, I'll just turn the damn thing off and throw on video games.", "is today like your first day on the planet or are you legit having a hard time understanding why someone would be upset if they were trying to spend quality time with you after you *offered*, and in the middle of it you just started doing some mundane ass task that absolutely could wait a little while longer. then you had the audacity to get irrate with him when you're the one who asked to put on a movie. you need to get your priorities straight and take some responsibility for yourself. instead you threw a tantrum over your boyfriend simply wanting to spend time with you. so yeah, YTA.", "\"I thought we were watching a movie?\"\n\nI'm guessing there's a greater than 50% chance that it wasn't something he was super excited to watch but did because you wanted to and it was a date night and/or you told him to put his phone away at some point and focus on being together.\n\nYTA", "You see now where you fucked up right OP?", "If it was so important, you should've mentioned it BEFORE the movie.", "Wow", "This.  \n\n\nAsk for an \"intermission.\" Toilet break, get snacks/drinks, fill out forms. Whatever. Just ask first.  \n\n\nOP, YTA.", "Oh come on, finishing to watch a movie then doing the forms isn't going to impact her future negatively, assuming they weren't due immediately. She could have finished spending time with her boyfriend and then done the forms.", "Certainly wouldn't be someone that isn't interested in me putting effort into getting my dream job, that's for sure.", "This is what I don\u2019t get. OP offered to do something with her SO together, when they were both off work so it would count as time spent with each other. And yet, she doesn\u2019t actually want to spend that time doing the thing she herself suggested. \n\nIf she had stuff to do in the 1st place, then why offer to do something at all? If filling out the forms were such a priority, then do that first or do that instead, rather than have a half-assed time together.\n\nIf I were the bf, I\u2019d be pretty offended, too. At the very least, saddened that my SO isn\u2019t seeing the time we\u2019re spending watching the movie as something to give her attention to not because of the movie itself, but because it is time spent together.", "Or have done them before the movie. It\u2019s not like she was forced to sit down for the movie", "You\u2019re getting downvoted because you keep saying the bf is the one that wanted to watch the movie. After dinner SHE asked HIM if they wanted to watch a movie. She\u2019s was acting like an ass and you keep trying to defend this lady", "I\u2019m with you. The reactions to this one have really surprised me.", "I guess the paperwork is not that important than. You can't have it both ways.", "Without bothering to tell him, just dropping it on him like that? Rude.", "\u2026 So you forgot about the paperwork that\u2019s \u201cso important to you,\u201d and blamed him for you deciding to cut out on quality time to work instead?", "Doing an activity together vs. two people doing separate activities. It\u2019s messed up.", "You are right.  I  don\u2019t get the reactions.  I sure don\u2019t feel obligated to watch a movie \u201ctogether\u201d when I have something else more compelling.  Or I am not into the movie.  I hardly ever watch anything without a crossword puzzle, needlepoint, etc.  nobody in my world minds, thank goodness.", "And i am sure it wasn\u2019t due right that minute, she could\u2019ve definitely waited until the movie was over.", "I mean i guess your marriage is different but yeah me and my husband would both be off put if we were watching something together and the other one decided to focus their attention on something else midway through. It\u2019s different if we just have something playing that we\u2019ve watched before but if we sit down to watch a new movie or show together then yeah we both focus on that.", "I legit dont get why you're getting downvoted for this like.. are people not aware that not everybody can focus the same way and actually some people NEED to be doing multiple things at once to achieve \"focus\"? and that being on a laptop in front of a movie with your spouse is basically *exactly the same* as being in front of a movie without it? And that not everyone enjoys consuming media in the exact same way and that being forced to pay full attention to every second of a movie actually can make the movie worse?\n\nif i tried to just watch a movie without also stitching/reading/drawing/taking notes on something/doing nonsense on my phone I would have a meltdown that would lead to a seizure, a migraine, or just a whole lot of nope. If this made my husband mad we'd have to just get divorced and like.. nobody I know just sits still with their partner watching a movie being forbidden to do anything else. Is this some american nonsense or some non-neurodivergent nonsense i just dont understand?", "Yes she has. You're just a pushover with very little self-respect for yourself and have acclimated to this behaviour over time. But that's fine if it works for you, but this is not acceptable for most couples.", "Many people can multi-task. I knit and watch TV and concentrate well on both. I can also interact with viewing partners while knitting. I cannot however be on my phone and pay attention to a movie/show. Not sure if I could fill out forms and pay attention and interact.", "This world is becoming such a strange, strange place. To get angry at someone for filling out a form for their dream job because they\u2019re not properly focused on a Christmas movie? Some people have important things to get done, life is not ideal all the time but I promise sitting and watching a movie while your partner finishes some important paperwork isn\u2019t the end of the world", "But that\u2019s not the issue for me, but the fact she went off on him, that she immediately got defensive and even accused him of being unsupportive.", "what a wild and totally inaccurate generalisation. I mean.. i dont know a single couple or person that would find it offensive or deem there to be a lack of self respect if one or both members of a couple were to be on laptops or phones (or reading or crafting or whatever) while watching a movie. neurodivergence can make it *impossible* to focus in the way people in this thread seem to think everyone HAS TO and hanging out watching a movie while doing other shit is.. enjoyable? super chill? completely normal and accomplished daily by happy thriving couples??", "I wasn\u2019t aware being off put and thinking something was the end of the world were the same thing.  Probably because they aren\u2019t and you\u2019re trying to overdramatize what I said to seem more in the right. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nBut  yeah  my husband has a really busy job actually and often gets emailed to do things in the evening. Anytime that happens when we are watching something together he communicates that to me and we just pause it until he\u2019s finished or save the rest of it for another day. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had a discussion or anything about how to handle that, that\u2019s just what seems like the natural thing to do for both of us.\n\nThis scenario happens to us not infrequently and like we literally just communicate with each other and it\u2019s never been an issue. I\u2019ve never gotten mad at my husband for having to do work and he respects our quality time enough to not start ignoring what we\u2019re doing midway through. \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f", "it's not the end of the world, it's just rude. he values spending uninterrupted time with her; if she doesn't then they're just not compatible.", "Yeah, that seems like a super healthy way to go about it. Seems like OPs bf wants her main focus on him though, if she\u2019s already had to speak with him about boundaries and needing to focus on getting work done a few days ago. I\u2019d be annoyed too if someone was constantly pestering me over dumb things\n\nEdit: also the end of the world comment was about OPs boyfriend, not your relationship. Sorry about the confusion", "They\u2019re literally watching a movie! They\u2019re not focused on eachother\u2026 they\u2019re focused on a movie. And she\u2019s obviously not, and is feeling stressed about being behind at work. And her bf thinks she should be fully focused on *a Christmas movie* because he wants her to? To me, it\u2019s rude to expect your SO to focus on a movie rather than the work she\u2019s mentioned multiple times about stressed about, but to each their own"]}
