I was sceptical at first but seeing this as a rare opportunity I messaged her and to my surprise it all checked out.\n\nAfter exchanging a few messages we arranged a meetup to collect the Lego. I got there, checked out all the sets and it all went smoothly. I walked away with what I can only describe as a dream come true for any Lego Star Wars fan.\n\nOnce at home, I went through all the sets organising, admiring and listing them. There were a couple sets I had wanted for years that were included and although I sold on most of the collection I kept a couple that I felt sentimental about finally having.\n\nFast forward to today, and I have received a message from the mum. She explained how she had sold the Lego collection as a rash form of punishment for her son. Apparently he had done something so incredibly heinous it warranted his collection being pawned off. She told me how her son has been distraught since losing his Lego and she had no clue how much the collection was really worth.\n\nI sympathise with the kid as I myself have lost Lego sets moving house or to an upset Dad and I know how devastating it can be. I can't imagine losing a collection like this. The problem is I have already sold off the majority of the collection, and really wouldn't like to give up these sets I've kept for myself. The mother is exploding at me for selling on her son's sets and I feel like a POS.\n\nI am unsure how to proceed. I genuinely bad for the kid, but the only thing I can offer is the three sets I have left, two of which I have always wanted.\n\nTL;DR I bought and sold a Lego Star Wars collection that turned out to belong to a kid whose mother sold it as punishment. Now she wants it back, but I've already sold most of it and want to keep some sets for myself.\n\nEdit: She is now asking for some of the money I made from selling the sets and is increasingly aggressive. I feel bad for the poor kid but I shall be blocking the mum without returning anything.", "created_utc": 1688844837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ud683/aita_for_selling_a_kids_lego_collection/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the kid is distraught, it's the mom's fault for selling his Legos.\n\nNow, if you feel really really *reaaally* bad, you can sell the remaining Lego sets back to the mother, so that at least some of them return to the kid's hands. But that's up to you.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t responsible for her bad parenting and rash decisions. If you understand the pain of losing something precious, it might be a kindness to a child to at least give him something but again, not on you.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t sell her son\u2019s legos. You sold yours. She\u2019s the one who done fucked up.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn\u2019t buy it someone else would of. His mom is the true AH here from what you have said so far.

She\u2019s already exploding at you for selling something that she sold to you. Doesn\u2019t acknowledge her own fault here.", "NTA. \n\nIt would be \"nice\" of you if you wanted to give them back.

She just found out she just can\u2019t easily replace them and is trying to take it out on you. Totally not your fault. If these are out of production Lego sets I\u2019d let the mother learn from her mistake and check out the after market mark ups. That\u2019s why she\u2019s mad and that\u2019s on her. Take toys away and give them back when the child has learned their lesson\u2026 that\u2019s not a hard concept. Unless they stole a credit card and bought the toys.

She isn't wanting to make up for what she did - she just wants more money to reward herself for bad parenting.\n\nNTA.

And possibly the kid for what they did. Just block her on facebook and carry on with your life.", "NTA block the woman and forget about it", "NTA Generally, in situations like this, all sales are final period, and she has no recourse legally to any items that she sold. this could also be a wonderful teaching moment for the mother.  Because as parents, we make mistakes, and we have to account for those mistakes. And it would be a teaching moment for her child  to learn that even as an adult we make mistakes, and once you've made a mistake, you have to move on from that and do the best that you can. But if it will truly haunt you, then you can always sell them back to her. But you also have to think. Is it going to truly haunt you after you sell them back to her? That you once had this prized possession and now no longer have it. Is her mistake going to cause you to do something that you too question, will regret in the near future? Only you can decide the answer to that question.\n\nAlso, will having only a few sets from a once vast collection be enough to appease the child. And therefore appease the mother. Or are you giving up something important to you and he's still gonna be mad.", "NTA 100%!  She just wanted more money from the sets once she learned how valuable they were.", "NTA. She sold it to you and you no longer have all of it.  She chose to make a rash decision and is trying to make you pay for it.
