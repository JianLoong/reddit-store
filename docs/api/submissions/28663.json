He can healthily and openly communicate his thoughts and feeling to family without being ashamed and you can\u2019t handle that? My whole family kisses on the cheek when we see each other and as we are leaving. I have no problems telling a brother or sister they look or will look handsome/beautiful. I don\u2019t understand being upset with this as all.", "YTA- wow. the fact you would never call your bro handsome speaks more about you then Jon.\n\nNothing wrong with him saying his sister would be beautiful in a dress or kissing her on a forehead. YOU are making this something more then it isnt.", "YTA how did you even get to the married point in this relationship?  I'm struggling to even see your first point - that he called his sister beautiful in the context of her wedding dress?", "YTA. There's nothing incestuous about their relationship from what you have provided. You sound jealous of your husbands sister and his love for her.", "Lol what...? I have a brother and I've told him he's handsome and I've kissed his forehead. He's my brother! I tell my friends when they look cute! I even tell my dad he looks handsome when he dresses up. It doesn't mean I'm hitting on anyone.... \n\nThis is just crazy overreacting. You might not be very close with your sibling like that but some people are. Stop trying to make it something gross. It sounds like you're insecure.", "YTA. Why are you sexualizing this relationship? People have different kinds of relationships with family, that\u2019s totally fine. Complimenting your sister isn\u2019t weird . Kissing her on her forehead isn\u2019t remotely sexual. You\u2019re the only one adding a sexual overtone to this- you\u2019re literally accusing your husband of being sexually attracted to his sister.

Unless you genuinely think they're doing something sketchy, there's nothing suspicious about ppl, especially siblings, spending time together without other ppl \"supervising\" them.

You need to chill out or you're going to make everyone miserable.", "Breathe.  You are getting jealous of a healthy relationship between siblings.

You find it weird because of ... who knows... your upbringing most likely.  \n\nTelling a sister she is beautiful and giving her a kiss on the forehead is normal. I do that to my brothers (I'm a dude).   \n\nWhat you have is a seriously damaging world view.", "YTA\n\n\n\nThey are being normal, and you are not. People who do not have healthy,  loving relationships with their immediate family have a hard time recognizing it in other families.", "YTA.  Imagine when OP has children. She'll be sexualizing her daughter because Daddy kisses her on the forehead. Or God forbid. He has a shower with his infant daughter.  Ugh.", "Um youre the asshole for sexualizing their sibling relationship lol you just seem bitter :/", "YTA what even", "Yta, can you elaborate on why people mistake them as a couple?", "Folks, is it incest to be affectionate with a sibling?\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nI agree with you husband. \n\nYou are overreacting because you are jealous and insecure maybe that they have a healthy sibling relationship that you don\u2019t or never had. \n\nYou are disgusting for thinking and claiming that they have a romantic/sexual relationship. \n\nYour husband is right to be pissed because his partner just said that he is cheating and having a romantic/sexual relationship with his sister who is also getting married. Also implying that he is cheating on you. \n\nYou need therapy to fix what ever thought process that makes you think that healthy sibling relationships are romantic/sexual.\n\nI hug, kiss, hang out, and play fight with my siblings. These things are normal for siblings even as adults. It\u2019s unfortunate that you don\u2019t have a strong enough bond to do these things with your siblings. \n\nAgain you need therapy for yourself and marriage counseling because what you said has probably had created a huge negative impact on your marriage and it could possibly ruin the marriage since its disgusting and appalling that you would ever think, feel, and believe such a thing. \n\nIf I were your partner I would be thinking of divorce. But divorce will happen if you make an ultimatum between you and sister or refuse to seek therapy personally and marriage counseling. However, there is a chance your husband and other people may think and act differently to this situation.", "YTA and a gross one at that. Nothing you wrote here is remotely inappropriate,  except how you treated your husband. You need to get over your insecurities.", "I was prepared to read some sweet home Alabama type mess and all you got was your husband saying his sister would look beautiful in a dress and that he kisses her on the *checks notes* forehead???

Please talk to someone, preferably a licensed mental health professional, about this to figure put why you're sexualizing your fianc\u00e9's relationship with his sister, this is just weird.", "YTA.

You have some serious issues to see a problem with this. Good luck with your relationship after this.

I had an extremely dysfunctional family, though I'm more envious of this kind of relationship. To start a fight over the belief that it's inappropriate... You're gonna have to decide if you can accept that many family's actually love each other and show it, or end it, because I promise you, he's not going to choose you if you give that type of ultimatum.", "Oh my stars! your husband loves and shows affection to his sibling.", "Bro, get the fuck over yourself.", "You can put your big red flag away now.

If they sleep in the same bed, make out and/or walk around naked then fine think this. \n\nMy brothers told me I was beautiful at my wedding and kissed me on the forehead before.", "YTA but gently, this is natural affectionate behaviour between siblings who love and care for each other. It shows a level of maturity and caring that is something to be proud of. It's a healthy dynamic and nothing weird or worrisome. It's a testament to their characters and upbringing that they are confident people who know when to compliment each other and be affectionate. I have no doubt that there is plenty of teasing, fighting, annoying each other wrestling etc. Natrally people who are comfortable with each other and are a similar age will be mistaken for a couple or related. Don't be uneasy with this. Show your love too. The world can be a difficult place and having a caring family / extended family can make a difference.", "The playfighting part could be weird if it's proper wrestling, but pushing each other away in a playful way, no weird. Kissing on the forehead, not weird. Saying an outfit would look beautiful, not weird. \n\nSiblings being mistaken for a couple, not just not weird but it happens to most siblings if they hang out and are the same age and kinda \"type\" but don't look so similar that you can tell straight away that they're siblings.\n\nThere might be something else that's making you feel like it's a bit off, but nothing you've described is actually weird. \n\nAnd Jon is totally normal for not wanting to talk to you after you accused him of incest. And, I mean, incest or wannabee incest is the accusation, don't pretend otherwise.", "Ugh play fighting and kissing on the head would make me uncomfortable but I also come from a family that didn\u2019t show love physically.
