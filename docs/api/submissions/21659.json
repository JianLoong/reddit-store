{"id": 21659, "submission_id": "14u32uv", "title": "AITA For Saying My Cousin's Side Hustle Is Morally Questionable?", "selftext": "Yesterday, I (F21) was at a family party for one of my younger cousin's birthday.\n\nWhile there Taylor Swift released cardigans for her new album (cardigans are a big deal in the fan base). I was trying to purchase one, but they sold out.\n\nAt this point I was inside, so I decided to go outside where my two cousins, Mark (M26) and Austin (M28) were sitting. Austin knows I am a pretty big Taylor Swift fan and asked me if I had gotten a cardigan. When I said no, Mark asked me if I wanted to buy one from him. I asked him what he meant, and he said he had bought 8 to resell.\n\nNow I understand needing money. I understand that sometimes you need to do things to have an income. But this is not the case for Mark. Mark works in corporate America with a 6 figure income (that he LOVES to brag about). Mark is also a trust fund kid and went to a top 10 college because he was a legacy. Also, these cardigans are $70. So ignoring shipping/tax, he dropped $560 on these. If he needed money, then he wouldn't have been able to afford to spend that kind of money on them in the first place.\n\nI made a face and he asked what was wrong. I asked him if he did the same thing with concert tickets. He responded yes like it was nothing and went on to tell me that he was able to make over $800 per ticket he resold.\n\nI did not get tickets to any of the concerts and was devasted because that was all my little sister had wanted for her birthday. I know Austin at least knows about this, and I thought Mark had known too since they were there when she sobbed because she didn't get them.\n\nAt this point is when I might be TA.\n\nI was pissed and told him that people like him are the scum of the Earth and that he needs to check his morals. I also told him that I hope his child (M7) never turns out like him.\n\nMark got up and walked into the house. When he left, Austin told me I was an asshat for saying that he needed to check his morals. I feel like I should say that Austin never said anything about the scum of the earth comment or the comment about his kid.\n\nWhen I got home last night, Mark's mother started sending me a bunch of texts telling me that she never wants to hear from me again and to never expect any money from them again (the only time they gave me money was my graduation two months ago).\n\nWhile I do regret bringing his kid into it, and fully know that the comment about the child was wrong, AITA for calling him out for his side hustle basically being preying on fans?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit since it has been mentioned a couple of times:\n\nWe live in NY so ticket scalping above 10% of the original price is illegal here. So his practices are technically illegal for the tickets alone.

Weird.", "You\u2019re going to get a lot of mixed opinions on this because it comes down to  the subjective question of \u201cis it okay to be individualistic and selfish\u201d. I would say being selfish is a disgusting trait that makes the world worse for everyone. Your cousin is capitalizing on extorting money from young girls. I also find it gross and reprehensible. But our society has normalized taking advantage of other people, getting yours and getting out. So it\u2019s understandable that some people perceive this as normal behavior. \n\nMy parents raised me by the golden rule- \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you\u201d and so I would never buy something at cost and sell it for a 800% profit.

Scalpers are utterly abhorrent, and I agree with you - I hope his kid turns out nothing like this exploitative AH too.

He buys items and resells them.  What do you think store's do?  Why do you think stubhub exist? He takes the risk that he will not able to resell the items, he spends his time on this and there is nothing to indicate he does it in morally questionable way.", "YTA. You were rude and this is literally how the world works. Pick any object you own and it's probably changed hands a minimum of 3-4 times before you received it, having it's price marked up each step of the way.\n\nIf he is an AH, then Taylor Swift is a bigger AH for selling $70 sweaters that were probably made in Honduras by people making $2/hr.", "Ugh, this is why we don't like swifties.", "For calling Mark out on his side hustle YTA. He isn\u2019t doing anything wrong or illegal, he is purchasing goods and selling them for a profit, nothing wrong with that. However Mark is aware that you and your sister are huge fans and that these goods are hard to get. It would have been nice of him, since he buys multiple items, to at least offer to sell you one at cost (no profit) when he purchases them since you tried but couldn\u2019t get it bcuz they sell out so quickly. It would be even nicer if him if he gifted one to you or your sister for a birthday or holiday, but that would be completely his choice and couldn\u2019t be expected of him. For him to profit off of you I think would be kind of an AH move since he has more product he can still make money on and you seem to be pretty close family. And you already seem to realize that it wasn\u2019t cool to bring his son into it when you got upset, and you didn\u2019t ask about that anyways.", "YTA.  What Mark is doing is perfectly legal. As long as he's not hijacking desperately needed medicines (ala Pharma Bro and insulin), food, and/or other goods, that's how the marketplace works. People resell stuff all the time.\n\nA Taylor Swift cardigan is a completely-discretionary purchase. You do not need one; you want one. From a moral standpoint, such a purchase can be seen as a waste of money on an unnecessary piece of merch. To tell someone to check their morals for reselling a completely unnecessary item that you want to buy is, quite frankly, rich.", "Would you still feel this way about him IF he had gifted you the cardigan and tickets for you and your sister? \n\nSoft YTA. What he is doing sucks, but I feel there is some jealousy here re his background, current financial situation etc. also he is not doing anything illegal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
