She needs someone who has basic comprehension skills, and isn\u2019t so lazy that they can\u2019t do the bare minimum", "If you insist that there should be no more than 3 servings to avoid leftovers (him) wouldn\u2019t it be the right way to separate the chicken into serving sizes before freezing?", "The thing is I am married and I\u2019m the one with the ADHD", "He does insist I do things his way. The only reason the chicken needs to be portioned out in the first place is because he doesn\u2019t like leftovers so now I just make enough for the 3 of us to eat a meal.", "Yes!", "Are you also implying that it\u2019s logical to dump your things in your parking spot when the other side is open or flush paper towels? How about agreeing to clean the bathroom if the other folds and hangs all the clothes we have when we got our drawers and taking 2 weeks to follow through? Saying you\u2019ll build the nightstands and not wanting help but also taking another 2 weeks to get it done? Maybe starting the dishwasher that\u2019s half empty and leaving a pile of dishes in the second sink? Or moving and then taking a rug full of sand upstairs instead of shaking it out first? Leaving a bucket full of candy where the dog can get it? I\u2019m sure I\u2019m sooooo controlling and want things done my way all the time because all of that is the way regular people run their home.", "Idk maybe one of us shouldn\u2019t eat or we should just give a piece to the dogs bc that\u2019s totally logical. 3 servings per meal for 3 people. I used to make more so we could have leftovers but he says he doesn\u2019t like eating the same thing twice so now we just make enough for dinner.", "If they are using three chicken breasts for each recipe, then putting three in each bag is probably the way that works for their household.  \n\nAs far as riding in a vehicle is concerned, it\u2019s generally not wise to do something the driver has said affects their driving negatively and has asked you not to do.  It\u2019s a safety issue.  If you feel the driver\u2019s request is unreasonable, that should be addressed when they are not actively operating a motor vehicle on a public roadway.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t care what your gender is; I\u2019m calling you out if you\u2019re flushing things that shouldn\u2019t be flushed.", "If the roles were reversed, everyone would be calling him a controlling asshole.", "When I have to spend 20 minutes hacking at chicken with a knife or sitting there washing the plastic, styrofoam, and paper off the chicken or I have to work extra hours because the chicken has frostbite it\u2019s a negative affect. When I have to park diagonal every day bc he dumped his gear on both sides of the garage it affects me. When I have to spend 30 minutes unclogging the toilet it affects me.", "2 weeks lol but we\u2019ve been married for 2 years.", "Oh yikes. Well I guess he can\u2019t be upset I nag either since it\u2019s such a small problem.", "I do all of the driving?", "No he went and separated it while frozen and put 3 in water to thaw and the rest in a ziplock in the freezer while still frozen", "If he doesn't respond or do what he said he would until he is nagged why wouldn't his partner just go directly to nagging? They train their partners to be nags (Because they ignore everything beforehand) & then complain that their partners are nags. Not accepting their own part in bringing about that dynamic.", "If he gave a shit, he\u2019d do it right.", "Okay, boomer.", "Then you need to prep and cook your own food. Let him have the crappy chicken, you have your own properly-prepped chicken. Let him eat his own screw ups.", "I mean what\u2019s the issue with the styrofoam? Like it takes a little longer to thaw but what else? I don\u2019t see that being an issue", "Just because you accept it doesn\u2019t mean everybody has to.", "He\u2019s not a child, but she\u2019s ended up with someone who has the practical knowledge and common sense of one. The way I see it is that she takes the time to teach him or she gives up entirely. She can\u2019t be angry at him for not already knowing something she\u2019s already been taught, though I\u2019d sure be angry at whoever raised him who skipped teaching him how to be a functional adult.", "She needs someone who follows commands you mean,", "Sure, but what a crazy hill to die on.", "Oh no, I totally feel you (I\u2019m definitely you in this scenario). I\u2019m just saying he obviously doesn\u2019t feel this way. And you\u2019re hardlining that you\u2019re way is the only way \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA but I don\u2019t think he is either.\n\nEdit: spelling/ grammar/ autocorrect/ exhaustion", "I\u2019m sure in your kind that sounded like a good defense but I think you proved the commentator right.", "I'm implying that you are both young. It takes time to learn how to run a household, and you personally do not have all the answers on all the correct ways to do so. \n\nI was married at 23, and it took a few years for us both to find our groove. I, too, thought I knew the right way to do everything, which caused a lot of resentment. Be right about everything, and good luck with your marriage. \n\nI am sure he has a laundry list of all the things you do that drive him nuts, too.", "I missed who the third person was, apparently.", "I agree on all three points. Somewhere I missed a third person to feed.\n\nDoesn't mean she isn't controlling on how everything needs to be done a certain way.", "If you want it done your way then do it yourself. He does it his way.", "Why are you following up on his actions? If he froze the chicken, he is the one who should be taking it out and hacking at it. That way he will see a natural consequence to his actions. And if he finds the effort of hacking at chicken less annoying than putting chicken into bags, then his method works for him.   \nAnd why are you unclogging the toilet if he clogged it? Why are you stepping in half way through these things? Just let him experience the full thing.", "Why is this a question?", "So? \n\nYou cant get mad at a child for acting like a child, but if you want an adult relationship, you need to choose better. \n\nHe is a big loser, but you picked him", "And why doesn't he drive?", "Whew! Glad that\u2019s the case.", "Separating a solid block of frozen chicken, that has fused to the moisture absorbing pad and the styrofoam and the plastic, is a huge pain. It also gets freezer burn because the packaging isn't designed to protect from that.", "No parking, clogged toilets, dirty bathrooms, denying help but not doing it, moldy dishes, sandy bedrooms, and poisoned dogs are good ways to do things. Got it.", "I\u2019ve been running a house hold since I was 12 taking care of 13 kids. I always ask him if he has any issues with me or if there\u2019s things I can do better and he says that there\u2019s nothing.", "Our roommate", "Because when I can\u2019t eat or park or flush the toilet after I use it there\u2019s not really a way to just avoid it.", "Because he said learn to drive", "You said learn to drive. I obviously know how to drive if I do it all.", "The Styrofoam, little pad thingy, and chicken become one irritating block. Not to mention most packages should have enough for several meals if you are only cooking for a few people. Two minutes to separate it or q half hour of fighting with frozen chicken", "Look you came her for judgement. Why are you fighting it so hard? Plenty of people, including myself believe your side has merit. But You also come off as impatient and controlling and his statement about walking on eggshells around you rings true. Is it so hard to admit to yourself that perhaps your approach is wrong? Or that the differences are irreconcilable and he isn\u2019t 100% to blame for that?", "So the one person in the world with nothing to improve. Wow.", "Maybe he answers that there\u2019s nothing because he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to you about this stuff. It\u2019s just chicken and you yell against him, when it comes to something important what are you going to do? Relax, talk to him. Find a middle ground. You are married, not acquaintances", "Then break up and move out before it's too late. \n\nRelationships are a two-way street, and I'm not seeing a whole lot of that in this post.", "What does he do then when the toilet is clogged? Does he just hold it in until you unclog the toilet? What about when chicken needs to be defrosted, does he just starve? \n\nOnce again, why are you stepping in and finishing the annoying parts? Let him do the easy parts, and the annoying parts.", "That the point you want to be stuck on? And sorry no, just because you do it lots doesnt mean you do it right. You make it sound like his fault is giving directions too early? Come on now\u2026", "I\u2019m not fighting it so much as just being super confused on whether you actually practice the above?", "There is no middle ground. \n\nOP needs stuff done her way \n\nOP needs it done now \n\nOP needs someone who already sees things her way. \n\nOP needs someone who enjoys being told what to do. \n\nThe good news is, that dude is out there.  I think a lot of guys should jump at that deal.", "Did you miss the whole post? It\u2019s not about the Iranian yogurt.", "Agreed. These two sound like they are poorly matched and both need some more time to grow up and mature. They\u2019re both so young. Hopefully they haven\u2019t yet scrambled their DNA and can make a clean break.", "So if you drive the same way you do every day and the person in the passenger seat tells you 600 ft and 2 full turn offs early you wouldn\u2019t be frustrated? Are you assuming I\u2019m not a good driver because I\u2019m a woman. Sorry to tell you driving is literally my job.", "Probably you are right. I can\u2019t imagine if they are going to have kids what the situation would be. They are far more important than a roommate too", "Personally, this is why I think no one should get married before college or before they're 30.", "For the sake of sanity, lets say you can drive. I also said you chose a partner poorly, and you havent argued that point once. What does that tell you????"]}
