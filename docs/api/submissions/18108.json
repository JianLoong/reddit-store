It is indeed their house and their rules, but in that case, there's two things you can do. You can not stay in the house and instead get a hotel to sleep in, or your girlfriend can chill at your place while you're at your parents house for a day or two.", "Not sleeping together because you aren't married is a pretty common rule in many families. \n\nBut, I'd go to the show and stay at a hotel for a few days, that way you can limit how much exposure your gf has with your family and you can get some time away from them if things go bad.  NTA because I dont think you should make your gf stay with them when you know they wont 'play nice'.", "NTA. Is staying in a hotel for a few nights an option?", "NTA - Either do the hotel or tell your sisters exactly why you aren\u2019t going without sugar coating it. They need to know who they\u2019re living with.", "NTA\n\nIf staying in a hotel isn\u2019t possible, just don\u2019t go. I\u2019m sure you have to\u201dwork/study/do an internship/something\u201d you can\u2019t possibly get out of. Just pick something your parents can\u2019t fix with money or otherwise solve for you.\n\nAsk them to FaceTime you during the show and send them flowers.", "NTA but do you have zero friends you might also visit and stay with? Or could you handle the cost of a motel a night or two? \n\nThe sleeping apart isn't that unusual (though you could both be in the same room with your sisters, just on separate pads/air mattresses), but the no kissing or affection is ridiculous. No full-on making out, sure, but no affection at all? Come on. \n\nAnd you should tell your parents that times have changed since they were children in their parents' houses!", "NTA, but I think you\u2019re framing this wrong. You say your three siblings would be fine sleeping like that, and have been in the past. I don\u2019t disbelieve you, but a lot of 13yo girls would less than happy and perhaps even significantly uncomfortable about sharing a bedroom with their 17yo brother, even if they wouldn\u2019t have cared when they were 11. The fact is, the sleeping arrangement could be justified, and framing it this way seems immature and entitled. You\u2019re assuming they would all be ok with it, but you can\u2019t really know that for sure.\n\nThe real issue here is your parents\u2019 bigotry. There is no reason to continue exposing yourself to that, and if I were you, I\u2019d be suspicious of their motives in suddenly wanting to meet your gf. It seems like they would likely turn that bigotry on her just as hard as they have on you, perhaps even in an intentional effort to sabotage your relationship. I mean, you\u2019ve left a reply to a comment implying that you aren\u2019t sure you would even consider going alone, so why would you want to expose your gf to that sort of abuse from them? I think you\u2019re using the sleeping arrangement as an excuse to avoid discussing the real issue. That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but it\u2019s not conducive to personal growth, either. You\u2019re not the asshole for being uncomfortable returning home, your parents are assholes for being bigots, but the sleeping arrangement isn\u2019t the real issue.\n\n~~INFO: Have you considered a hotel room?~~", "Your parents are TA. But why can\u2019t your girlfriend stay at your place for a few days while you visit your sisters?", "NAH I don\u2019t think your parent\u2019s rules for a significant other in the house are unreasonable. You don\u2019t share a bed & no PDA. That seems about right to me. \n\nI can also understand not wanting an uncomfortable night\u2019s sleep.\n\nI think going to see your sisters\u2019 performance is way more important than your sleeping arrangements, though.\n\nI also don\u2019t think your gf has to come with you just because she\u2019s staying at your place for the summer. If you think your parents won\u2019t be hospitable, go home on your own for one night only. Yeah, it\u2019s not much of a trip. But you\u2019re supporting your sisters without being around your parents enough to be too bothered.", "Nta, I saw you said hotel is too expensive.
