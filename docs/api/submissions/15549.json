Her main mode of transportation is/was a car that's in my name and paid for by me, but she's the only one who uses it since I have a truck that I use. This past week while on her way home from her job, she got into an accident while making a turn at an intersection with a sharp corner around some trees that's difficult to see if there is oncoming traffic. The way she describes it she believed to be in the clear and started slowly inching forward at the same time a van came speeding around the corner. Between the angle of the hit and how fast the van was going, nearly the entire front of my car was taken off though fortunately no one was injured. She called me sobbing and panicking, she could barely speak while she told me what happened. \n\nI rushed over to pick her up and we got a tow truck sorted for the car, which is definitely totaled, and she was still shaking from the whole ordeal and profusely apologizing. She's been in a couple car accidents before as a kid, but this was the first where she was behind the wheel. I know she wasn't being reckless, that intersection absolutely sucks. The accident was just that, an accident. The car is what it is, but I was just glad my daughter was alright. Since she was still shaken up I took her to dinner at one of her favorite restaurants that we don't go to very often to help her calm down, which did help her mood quite a lot.\n\nI assumed everything was fine until I get a call from her mother, my ex-wife, berating me for essentially rewarding our daughter for wrecking the car. She was always the type to insist that giving someone treats after bad behavior would encourage said behavior, which I understand to an extent for little kids, but my ex-wife ended the call by basically saying I've just encouraged her to damage any future car she's driving to go to a nice dinner. I don't believe my daughter is the type to do that, she was already kind of a nervous driver to begin with and this situation has likely only escalated that, but when I met up with some buddies they agreed my ex-wife has a point and I probably shouldn't have taken her to dinner right after the accident since she was still technically at fault and should've been more careful. This now has me doubting my actions, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1682309040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12x2g0u/aita_for_rewarding_my_daughter_after_her_car/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your ex sounds insufferable. Who is going to wreck their car repeatedly to get a free dinner\u2026", "NTA\nThey\u2019re called accidents for a reason. \nShe wasn\u2019t intending to smash her mode of transport, she made a judgement in error and what seems a very small error, just with a big outcome. \n\nYour ex needs to calm down. Your daughters in one piece and a car is replaceable. \n\n(This is from someone who use to cut people out of accidents for a job. You see what is important and what is not)\n\nPunish the intent, not the outcome.", "NTA this is not \"bad behaviour\" this is an accident it was not intentional. She didn't make a bad choice she made what she and you based on your comment was the best choice she could and there was a bad outcome. Supporting her during this time and being there emotionally will help her", "NTA. Punishing her for an accident, which is likely not her fault at all, will crush her confidence. You focused on what was important to you- your daughter's safety; your ex is hung up on the car. You are a sensible dad- keep rocking!", "NTA\n\nAnd your ex sounds like a piece of work \ud83d\ude2c \n\nYou said it yourself, this was an accident. Your daughter didn't screw up in any obvious way, and it was a bad intersection, and these things happen. It was nice of you to take her out and try and make her feel better.", "NTA, you were trying to make her feel better. your daughter is probably not so crazy she would ruin a car for a dinner, she is an adult and assuming she works and is in her right mind, she knows if you spend all ur money on her crashing cars, there won\u2019t be any money left for dinner. like what lol", "NTA, you weren't rewarding a bad behavior, you were supporting and comforting after an accident.", "NTA - she had been in a shocking and scary incident where it doesn\u2019t sound like she had been reckless, she just judged a difficult intersection wrongly. It wasn\u2019t bad behaviour, it was an accident. She needed reassurance and comfort and you did the right thing IMHO. The shock of what happened will stay with her for a long time.", "NTA\n\nYou weren\u2019t rewarding her or encouraging her to get in more accidents you were comforting her. There\u2019s a huge difference.\n\nWhile I do agree with the premise that you shouldn\u2019t reward bad behavior this is not a behavioral issue. This was an accident and thankfully no one was hurt. \n\nI do suggest having her take a defensive drivers course to boost her confidence and awareness while driving. It will help her a lot.", "NTA. I see part of the reason you might be divorced.", "NTA. Car accidents are just--they can be so bad, and if everyone walked away with their health and their lives, my god that's worth a moment of gratitude and appreciation. There's nothing more terrifying and congrats on being the kind of dad who knows what's \\*really\\* important.", "NTA She had a traumatic experience and you were kind. You actually helped move the trauma thru her body where (not trying to be too woo woo here) it can get stuck. You agree that intersection is dangerous, even though technically she\u2019s at fault. What would be better is to avoid that intersection if possible all together. Also, report the blind spot to the proper authorities bf someone gets killed.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter WASN'T 'misbehaving' to get punished for (or in this case not rewarded) she had a bad experience and needed a pick me up, which you provided. AND SHE IS AN ADULT. Your time for 'rewarding' or 'punishing' was over FOUR years ago, but your ex doesn't seem to realize that. \n\nYou aren't an AH for being kind to someone who had had a VERY rough day. Also, your daughter isn't 16 driving recklessly. She's 22. Your EX is your EX (and I can see why tbh). Your ex doesn't have any say in  you and your ADULT daughter's relationship or eating habits.\n\nYou are definitely NOT an AH here, but your ex is for butting into your relationship with your daughter, your business (car is YOURS), and your dinner plans (seriously!? You can go to dinner where and when you want). I can see why you divorced her.\n\nStick to your guns, OP. \"This is none of your business.\" Is totally an acceptable response to everything your ex said.", "NTA. Positive reinforcement e.g rewarding good behavior works because the being receiving it interprets it that way. Your ex-wife is reducing your daughter to a simple animal by suggesting that she would interpret that as a reward. Humans are complex and we can understand nuances in behaviors. As can many animals though to a lesser degree.\n\nYour daughter isn't going to interpret it as a reward because that makes no sense lol.", "NTA - She probably can't afford to buy a nice car, and it's important to be able to get around. And it wasn't completely her fault.", "NTA. Accidents are terrifying enough in itself to make someone aware to be extra careful next time they drive. She is facing repercussions emotionally already\u2026 what she needs most now is support, which is exactly what you\u2019re doing! Glad to know your daughter is physically okay and I hope she won\u2019t take too long to get back behind the wheel, otherwise she may grow resistant to driving again due to fear. \n\nAlso I would definitely take this opportunity to invest in a dashcam for the future!", "NTA. It would be one thing if she was drag racing or under the influence(I say drag racing only because it's a thing there I live\ud83d\ude44) but like you said, it was an accident. It was total trauma for her. Listen.... It could have went another way and you may have never had dinner, or any meal, with your daughter ever again. I see it as you being caring and letting her have emotional relief from the accident. One time I was almost part of a huge accident caused by cars in front of me on the freeway... I almost got hit but swerved and when I looked in my rear view mirror, I was the only one driving away. I pulled off the exit to a gas station and had a massive panic attack. I didn't drive for weeks after that, and I wasn't even the cause of the accident. You're a good dad.", "NTA. her mother should be glad her daughter\u2019s safe. that sounded like a bad accident. you absolutely had the right to take your daughter out to her favourite restaurant after that shitshow. glad to hear her mood improved after that, i cant imagine how terrifying that must have been.", "NTA, you\u2019re a good dad and you made an incredibly difficult situation easier for your daughter. She clearly is taking responsibility and feels bad enough on her own. I still remember exactly what my parents said on the phone when I called them after my first accident, she will remember the kind thing you did for the rest of her life!", "Rewarding? \n\nWas the dinner at a 3 star restaurant with a 7 course tasting menu paired with wines for each course?\n\nBecause last I checked, even a really crappy car costs more than a REALLY fancy meal.\n\nRisking life and limb for some food? You have bigger problems if that is what you expect to happen...", "NTA. And your \u201cbuddies\u201d suck. Good on you for prioritizing your daughter\u2019s mental well-being.", "NAH - I do get your ex-wife's position. You could argue that it is rewarding bad behaviour.\n\nHowever, your daughter is an adult, and she definitely knows she made a mistake, one she's not likely to make again.\n\nYou didn't take her out to dinner to reward her. You took her there to calm her down and to get over the shock she had just experienced. For all you know, you've prevented it from becoming a trauma.\n\nIn any case, punishing your daughter or yelling at her wouldn't have done anyone any good.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I swerved to miss it and ended up in the ditch and my axle fell off my car. I was really shaken up and my mom had the same approach as you in making sure that I was okay and calm. I think you handled this the best way possible. It's been almost 6 months and I still sometimes get really nervous when I drive now. I can't imagine how bad it would be if my parent had yelled at me.
