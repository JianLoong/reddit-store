The accident was just that, an accident. The car is what it is, but I was just glad my daughter was alright.

I don't believe my daughter is the type to do that, she was already kind of a nervous driver to begin with and this situation has likely only escalated that, but when I met up with some buddies they agreed my ex-wife has a point and I probably shouldn't have taken her to dinner right after the accident since she was still technically at fault and should've been more careful.

She didn't make a bad choice she made what she and you based on your comment was the best choice she could and there was a bad outcome. Supporting her during this time and being there emotionally will help her", "NTA. Punishing her for an accident, which is likely not her fault at all, will crush her confidence. You focused on what was important to you- your daughter's safety; your ex is hung up on the car. You are a sensible dad- keep rocking!", "NTA\n\nAnd your ex sounds like a piece of work \ud83d\ude2c \n\nYou said it yourself, this was an accident.

It wasn\u2019t bad behaviour, it was an accident. She needed reassurance and comfort and you did the right thing IMHO. The shock of what happened will stay with her for a long time.", "NTA\n\nYou weren\u2019t rewarding her or encouraging her to get in more accidents you were comforting her. There\u2019s a huge difference.\n\nWhile I do agree with the premise that you shouldn\u2019t reward bad behavior this is not a behavioral issue. This was an accident and thankfully no one was hurt. \n\nI do suggest having her take a defensive drivers course to boost her confidence and awareness while driving. It will help her a lot.", "NTA. I see part of the reason you might be divorced.", "NTA.

There's nothing more terrifying and congrats on being the kind of dad who knows what's \\*really\\* important.", "NTA She had a traumatic experience and you were kind. You actually helped move the trauma thru her body where (not trying to be too woo woo here) it can get stuck. You agree that intersection is dangerous, even though technically she\u2019s at fault.

Also, your daughter isn't 16 driving recklessly. She's 22. Your EX is your EX (and I can see why tbh). Your ex doesn't have any say in  you and your ADULT daughter's relationship or eating habits.\n\nYou are definitely NOT an AH here, but your ex is for butting into your relationship with your daughter, your business (car is YOURS), and your dinner plans (seriously!? You can go to dinner where and when you want). I can see why you divorced her.\n\nStick to your guns, OP. \"This is none of your business.\" Is totally an acceptable response to everything your ex said.", "NTA. Positive reinforcement e.g rewarding good behavior works because the being receiving it interprets it that way. Your ex-wife is reducing your daughter to a simple animal by suggesting that she would interpret that as a reward. Humans are complex and we can understand nuances in behaviors. As can many animals though to a lesser degree.\n\nYour daughter isn't going to interpret it as a reward because that makes no sense lol.", "NTA - She probably can't afford to buy a nice car, and it's important to be able to get around.

It would be one thing if she was drag racing or under the influence(I say drag racing only because it's a thing there I live\ud83d\ude44) but like you said, it was an accident. It was total trauma for her. Listen.... It could have went another way and you may have never had dinner, or any meal, with your daughter ever again. I see it as you being caring and letting her have emotional relief from the accident. One time I was almost part of a huge accident caused by cars in front of me on the freeway... I almost got hit but swerved and when I looked in my rear view mirror, I was the only one driving away. I pulled off the exit to a gas station and had a massive panic attack. I didn't drive for weeks after that, and I wasn't even the cause of the accident. You're a good dad.", "NTA. her mother should be glad her daughter\u2019s safe. that sounded like a bad accident. you absolutely had the right to take your daughter out to her favourite restaurant after that shitshow. glad to hear her mood improved after that, i cant imagine how terrifying that must have been.", "NTA, you\u2019re a good dad and you made an incredibly difficult situation easier for your daughter. She clearly is taking responsibility and feels bad enough on her own. I still remember exactly what my parents said on the phone when I called them after my first accident, she will remember the kind thing you did for the rest of her life!", "Rewarding? \n\nWas the dinner at a 3 star restaurant with a 7 course tasting menu paired with wines for each course?\n\nBecause last I checked, even a really crappy car costs more than a REALLY fancy meal.\n\nRisking life and limb for some food? You have bigger problems if that is what you expect to happen...", "NTA. And your \u201cbuddies\u201d suck. Good on you for prioritizing your daughter\u2019s mental well-being.", "NAH - I do get your ex-wife's position. You could argue that it is rewarding bad behaviour.\n\nHowever, your daughter is an adult, and she definitely knows she made a mistake, one she's not likely to make again.\n\nYou didn't take her out to dinner to reward her. You took her there to calm her down and to get over the shock she had just experienced. For all you know, you've prevented it from becoming a trauma.\n\nIn any case, punishing your daughter or yelling at her wouldn't have done anyone any good.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like your daughter was already upset and felt bad about the accident. Taking her to dinner to decompression/cheer her up is not rewarding her, it\u2019s human decency and kindness.

I think what you did was kind.  You saw how shook up she was and you wanted to comfort her and get her mind off things.  Comforting someone is not the same as rewarding them.   She wasn\u2019t misbehaving, she was just in an accident.  She didn\u2019t set out to cause mischief that day so she shouldn\u2019t get punished.
