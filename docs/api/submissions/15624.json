I'm glad that works for you, but frankly, most people should be splitting costs as close to 50/50 as possible (assuming their income is roughly equal anyway). If someone doesn't want their money to go to the mortgage for whatever reason, then what they do contribute should be equal to what the partner is putting towards mortgage as judged by the person who owns the property (this is unnecessary if it's a purely financial situation, but in your case you're also doing chores and errands that I assume your partner doesn't want to do, and they value that as good enough to be equal to them paying mortgage). In either case, you're paying money and getting nothing in return, the difference is that if you *don't* break up, you now have claim to the investment, and you can also say that you helped your significant other contribute to a shared asset. \n\nBasically, paying rent that goes towards mortgage should be the default idea, and any agreement otherwise should not be assumed.
