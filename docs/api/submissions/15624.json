Dude. I'm of the *general* opinion that costs of living should be split equally. That means the mortgage, utilities, food, etc. She may be unable to contribute enough. She likely isn't paying anything while living with her dad so having a big monthly nut to cover is scary and possibly not possible. Finances destroy soooo many relationships. This is already starting out on the wrong foot. Also, you've been together for six (6) months. That's nothing. Why is everyone so eager to live together? That, too, destroys so many relationships. You're not ready; just my opinion.", " NTA Inform her that no matter where she rents, she probably paying someone\u2019s mortgage.", "NTA. Unless y'all are married and your finances are based in joint accounts, you are two separate people. You are well within your rights to ask her to pay rent. If she is refusing, I'd see that as a red flag tbh.", "NTA for wanting to split the housing costs. \n\nBut if you do, draw up a tenants agreement because if she just gives you money to pay the mortgage, she can gain ownership rights. It can vary by state so consult a real estate attorney.", "You\u2019ve known her for half a year and she is going to dictate terms to you? No. Do not move this person into your life so soon. If ya do, you\u2019d better have a lease. NTA", "NTA - I just moved in with my boyfriend. He owns the condo we live in. He never had to ask me for rent, it was something I offered because this is his asset and I\u2019m renting the space I use. In exchange, I get a cheaper rent than market value. Your girlfriend is trying to mooch off of you. Don\u2019t move her in, she isn\u2019t ready for this level of commitment.", "NTA \nIt is a perfectly reasonable request to split the rent if she is moving into YOUR place.", "NTA. Your house your rules. If she can\u2019t accept that then you lose a potential housemate; maybe a GF too. Such is life, some losses end up being blessings.", "NTA \nIf you\u2019re considering living together, it\u2019s time to have serious conversations about finances & long term goals. Whether or not this relationship leads to marriage, living together will impact both of your finances\u2026 how well you communicate & compromise will effect your futures. \nIt\u2019s better to know NOW if your goals & plans to achieve them are compatible. \nThings don\u2019t have to be an even split, some couples use a percentage based on income, others depend on the primary \u201cbreadwinner\u201d\u2026 together you can decide what works best. \nWhatever you decide, I highly recommend having individual checking & saving accounts & a joint account that you both contribute to for bills, groceries, etc.", "If she covers the food and utilities that would total up to whatever half the mortgage is then that would equal out. However I've heard of some entitled people that don't feel they need to pull their weight.\nThere is also some that feel \"half\" isn't fair when you consider what each person brings home. I've heard people splitting bills based on a percentage. If that mashes sense. Yall need to sit down and write down Household bills and find what works and you both agree to.", "NTA If she dont want to pay rent she got no rights to move anything", "NTA. 6 months? is she for real?\n\nShe can pay rent that you choose, and of course contribute to groceries, or she can date you from afar.\n\nUnless you're marrying her this year, this is the only way.", "NTA\n\nThis early in a relationship, and with her having another option (living with her dad) it makes sense to split things.\n\nIf she's looking for a relationship where she is financially dependent, she needs to be clear about that and date men that are also seeking that.", "Your gf shouldn't pay your mortgage unless she is getting a stake in your home. If you're comfortable with that, speak to a lawyer & draw up some papers. If you're not, let her pay bills & food.", "How much is your mortgage and how much would comparable rent be?\n\nIf you\u2019re charging her half the mortgage and it\u2019s considerably more than the rent she would pay elsewhere then you\u2019re definitely the arsehole. YTA\n\nI think it\u2019s creepy to get your GF to pay off your mortgage like this. She will be your tenant, not your GF.

She is using you for a free place to stay and it is 100% reasonable to expect to split the rent. You need to be firm with her before she moves in.", "Is she moving in with you because her dad started to charge her rent?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Splitting it is pretty much how it works with anyone--especially if she eventually wants to get married. Teamwork is 50:50.", "NTA\n\nDid she tell you what her income is? Can she not afford rent and that\u2019s why she said she\u2019d pay for groceries?", "NTA, she can either agree to actually pay to live with you, whether that's taking over the utilities or something else, or not move in!", "NTA. It also might not hurt to speak to an attorney about your liability in this scenario if you can afford it. I don't want to make assumptions, but all things considered it may be a good idea. At least you will be prepared should things turn south and you wind up with someone you have to evict to get rid of.", "NTA. Her response to you being relieved and grateful is... a red flag. I would consider giving her two options: not moving in, or paying rent like she would anywhere else, especially since you're her partner and partners split costs.", "NTA, but tell her you only eat fresh lobster that she will have to pick up daily for all three meals.", "NTA. She is demanding free accommodation. You guys need to have a serious discussion about finances and expectations **BEFORE** you start living together.", "NTA", "YTA, why the hell would you charge rent for a SO? If you like her and possibly love her are you gonna have her sign a tenants agreement when your married? I mean come on now, not everything is a 50/50 split in life and you\u2019re the one inviting her into your home, that\u2019s like inviting someone to dinner and not covering the bill. Hopefully she finds someone better and with more chivalry in their system.", "I'm pretty sure policies vary, but in my city, every tenant must pay their rent. If she is living there, she must pay rent. If that's the policy, then NTA.", "Info: \n\nWould you be willing to pay her rent if you guys moved into her house?", "NAH. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to pay your mom\u2019s mortgage with you. She doesn\u2019t have to. In other circumstances she\u2019d have say in the cost, location, etc about where y\u2019all lived. You are also allowed to have financial boundaries with someone coming into your living space. Stuff like this determines your compatibility, are you both working together toward a solution or trying to make unilateral decisions? It has to work for both of you and there are lots of ways to do it.", "[deleted]", "I don't think such costs should be split 50:50 bur split based on each person's ability to contribute. That said she should pay something towards rent, food and utilities.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Frankly, I'd be concerned about a partner that expects you to provide her with a home after just six months.", "NTA. She's looking for a free ride. If you buy a house don't put her name on it lol.", "NTA. So I'm living in the same situation. Obviously I don't charge her exactly how much she paid previously but to both of us it was quite obvious to split what she was saving. E.g. previous rent 1500 so it makes sense to split the 1500 saved to 750. Though we agreed on 500 since she mostly buys groceries.\n\nAlso I take it as a \"upkeep and utilities\" payment and definitely not mortgage.", "Guy why are you moving a girl into your house you don\u2019t know? You don\u2019t know this girl. Her reaction to you telling her she won\u2019t be living for free is telling isn\u2019t it? Is her p supposed to be her rent payment? And yes make her pay rent if you are dumb enough to let her move in..", "This is the most reasonable, common sense response/outlook. Seems to me OP's gf is trying to get away with contributing as little money as she can, in a sneaky way.", "Because he gets a house at the end of it, and she doesn't?", "I think people should move in with each other much sooner to understand if they're compatible. Imagine having a relationship with someone for years and only then finding out you cannot live together, such a waste of time.", "This is very important.  You should have an agreement in writing with your parents as to whether you are going to get the house at some point if you keep paying the mortgage.  And you need to have a written rental agreement with your gf to make sure she doesn't get any kind of rights to ownership by paying part of the mortgage.  Do consult a lawyer!", "OP doesn't own the house, he is paying his mum rent in the form of covering the mortgage.", "I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how rent works in most circumstances though", "actually none of them gets the house, his mom does. And why wouldn't she pay? she lives there, she pays the rent. easy!!!", "Bit of a reach to say that op gets the house when there is no information to say that op takes ownership at any point in the future.", "Isn\u2019t that what rent is?  Rent an apartment one gets a place to live and no equity.", "Yeah rent should help cover the food and bills, the mortage is his problem since it will be his property. She needs to help pay but not for something she's not part of.", "With a landlord one isn't shagging? Sure.*\n\nWith a committed romantic partner? Absolutely not. \n\nAnd if anyone reading this has a similar set up, please reconsider. \n\n*And even then, I have my reservations.", "I think this would need to be clarified, but I doubt OP is paying off his Mum's mortgage & getting nothing out of it - if he is, he also needs to speak to a lawyer.\n\nWhy wouldn't she pay rent? Because she's helping to pay her partner's mortgage & getting no equity. If he wants help, she should get a stake in the ownership. If he doesn't, they can work out another contribution to the household.", "It's not the same when you're in a relationship with someone. Your partner shouldn't be your landlord. If you're helping them buy a house, you should have a share in that house. Pro-rated, of course.", "Doesn't say it will be his property.", "You aren't owed anything just because you're in a relationship. If *she* wants to move in with him, but he's more hesitant about it and would like financial contributions to take some weight off the arrangement (after all, once you're moved in, even more so than usual you're moving as a unit, right?), that's their arrangement to figure out. Now, if *he* was pushing her to move in with him, but then also demanding rent as a consequence, that'd be an AH move. But you don't owe someone free rent and board just because you're shagging them.", "It's not paying off their mortgage, she lives there, she benefits from a service. You really don't understand how housing works, your logic is 'she shouldn't pay rent because she has sex with him, well, he has sex with her and offers housing on top of it. (and he didn't even ask for deposit) :)))", "If you're in a relationship & you're helping your partner pay for something - you're entitled to a share. Especially if without you, they were paying & with you & your money, they get a reduction in their payments. That's what partnership is. \n\nIt doesn't matter who asked who, it doesn't matter who is reluctant, (if someone is reluctant they should speak up), if your partner is paying a share of the mortgage, they should share in the equity.\n\nIf not, she can contribute to the household some other way.", "Of course it's paying off the mortgage. \n\nHe said it himself, \"it would be a relief to split the rent with her\". If that's how he feels, she should get a stake. \n\nIf he doesn't want her to have a stake, she should make contributions elsewhere.\n\nThis is a relationship, he's not her landlord."]}
