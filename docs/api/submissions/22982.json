We've been together for 2 years and I didn't suspect anything out of the ordinary. I knew he didn't have a good home life so I never questioned it. We would always be at my place because he was \"uncomfortable\" being at home with his parents. (keep in mind he told me he still lived with his parents but helped pay rent). Everytime we would go on dates I would pay. I didn't really mind because I'm financially very well off and have never had a hard time in my life. My love language is giving gifts so spoiling him and paying for dinner dates never really bothered me. As of lately I've been seeing girls get princess treatment on TikTok and getting pretty jealous of it considering my boyfriend never pays for anything or does any of that and it made me question our relationship. I shrugged it off as I didn't wanna be rude or force anything because if he wanted to he would, right? I started to get suspicious because we've been dating for 2 years and I've never been to his house and met his parents. Everytime I brought it up he would just shrug it off or tell me he didn't wanna talk about it so I had Enough, I tried looking for his family on Facebook and found them after a few searches because his last name is very rare. I texted the first person I saw and assumed it was his mom. She replied to me 2 days later asking who I was so I told her I was dating her son. She absolutely went off on me saying random bullshit about my boyfriend that I was so confused about, I knew he didn't have a good home life but I didn't know it was this bad. One thing that caught my eye in every horrible thing she said was how she and the rest of the family hasn't had contact with him in over 4 years. I decided to not approach him about it because he has really bad anger issues and I didn't wanna set him off into a rage since I went behind his back and texted his mom. I waited till after our usual dinner date because he would always \"walk\" home even after I offered to drop him off so many times but he would refuse saying he \"lived close\" and \"it's fine I could use a walk\". I said alright but when he was walking away I decided to follow him \u201chome\" and keep my distance so he wouldn't know I was following him. It took him 10 minutes but I saw him walking into a homeless shelter. I felt betrayed that he would lie to me about where he lived and that was the final straw that opened my eyes. I was done. I did so much for him. Fed him, bought him new clothes, always bought him flowers, always paid for meals and showered him with attention and he couldn't even just do the bare minimum by not lying to me. We've been dating for 2 years and he didn't want to think of telling me at any point. Safe to say this was my final straw and I don't think I can see myself providing for a man for my whole life. I texted him and broke it off while listing my reasons. His anger issues spiked up per usual so I blocked him to keep my peace. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1690153667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157tau7/aita_for_leaving_my_poor_and_homeless_boyfriend/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s not an AH for not wanting to admit he\u2019s homeless. Let\u2019s have some compassion about the shame he must feel. He is an AH for having anger issues. As far as money and who spends it on who, there are literally millions of men that pay for everything, so who cares. That doesn\u2019t make him bad or an AH. \n\nYou\u2019re an AH for reaching out o his parents behind his back, especially if you don\u2019t know the whole story. He may be homeless because his parents were abusive. He may have trauma and doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it.\n\nThe biggest thing that makes you AH is going on IG and seeing \u201cprincess treatment\u201d and that making you question your relationship.

You ignored a lot of red flags and you dance around his \u201canger issues,\u201d you took two years to wonder why you hadn\u2019t been to his home or met his family\u2026.good for you for getting out now, but you were willfully blind for a while, and going behind his back to find out the truth is a good example of the lack of emotional maturity on your part that got you into this situation. \n\nBut he\u2019s also an AH for lying about something so big for so long", "Lol, princess treatment on TikTok. That app where everything is real?", "You didn\u2019t respect his not wanting to talk about his family, so you contacted them behind his back. That\u2019s not ok.\n\nSecondly, you mention he has bad anger issues. Why are you sticking around knowing this? \n\nHow do you date someone for two years, with all the flags you have described? \n\nESH. You for going behind his back and him for keeping a secret like this.", "NTA. He has anger issues and lied to you all this time. At some point you need to come clean with your partner. You're looking for an equal and he can't be that.", "NTA. He lied to you for TWO YEARS! Good for you for dumping him. \n\nI could understand if he was shy to admit his living situation, but no one deserves to be deceived by their partner for that long. Not a strong foundation for a relationship if there\u2019s no honesty.", "ESH.  \"I texted the first person I saw...\"  No.", "YTA.. You have no idea why he's homeless, what he might be doing to end his homeless days. Finding a job is hard when you're homeless, I know I've done it, and it's really embarrassing to tell a girlfriend, seeing as a lot of girls today want the \"Princess treatment\", that you are on the streets. Now he shouldn't have waited 2 years to let the cat out of the bag, but he did and a good girlfriend would have talked about it.. BTW who's idea was it to spend money(dinners,gifts,outing,est) yours or his?", "NTA - though the anger issues that you tiptoe around are even more alarming than the lies. Definitely don't bother with him again. Keep him blocked, stay away, immediately cut contact if he tries to call from another line. Good luck moving forward!", "NTA. He had two years to be honest with you. And he chose to lie after lie after lie. I'm sorry you went thru this.", "NTA! You did the right thing by leaving him. I know you might feel guilty, but he used you, and that's unforgivable.", "NTA\n\nNot having a home is obviously a very important thing to know about one's SO.

I think you made the right choice. Especially since he has that anger issue. You don't need that in your life.", "NTA - why did you ever let this go on for so long? Do you have no self-respect?

I'm sure that you deserve so much more, you deserve to know where your partner is from, where he lives, who he lives with, where he works (and YES he should work and support himself), etc. He's been treating you like a Sugar Mama and it's NOT ok.", "No. He's no good. He was only using you.", "You're NTA and your boyfriend is TA for lying to you for so long.

I\u2019m glad to hear you did not forgive him that lying and want to continue with him. The anger issues are a huge scary red flag.", "First of all do not model your life off of TikTok.
