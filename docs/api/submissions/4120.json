I often discuss confidential information with clients and doctors.  I am not a doctor myself.  \n\nIn July of this year I finally had an opportunity to for employment that would give me the option of working from home.  \n\nI sat down with my wife and explained that this was a good thing for us.  I would be home three more days every week.  I would still be going into the office on Tuesday and Thursday.  But the other days I could skip out on the commute.  I could help with the my daughter in the morning and throughout the day. I could help with supper. I could see my 4 year old daughter more. \n\nNot all the time of course. I was still going to be working.  But our car would be home three extra days.  My wife could take our car and drop off our daughter with our parents or a sitter if she needed.  \n\nWe say and talked to my daughter and explained that even though I was home I could not spend all my time with her.  I explained that if the door was closed she needed to  knock quietly and ask permission to come in. And to accept it if the answer was no.  \n\nMy daughter understood. My wife did not.  She was constantly coming into the office when I was in meetings.  I had to excuse myself to get her out of the room.  More than once I saw my daughter trying to keep her out of my room.  One time my wife was trying to carry my daughter into the room and my kid was holding onto the door jamb so she didn't get in trouble for coming in when the door was closed.  \n\nI finally put a lock on the door.  She said she didn't like being locked out of a room in her house.  I explained that the door being closed and a sign saying that I was in a meeting didn't stop her.  She finally got the point. Until this thanksgiving. \n\nI was working on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and she needed to go buy something for our meal the next day.  And for some reason could not take our daughter with her. Or drop her off with either set of grandparents.  Or a drop in day care where we have a spot. \n\nShe instead decided to shake my locked door and knock until I answered.  I muted my meeting opened the door and told her to leave me alone until the end of the day.  She left and texted that my daughter was watching tv in the other room.  \n\nI talked to my boss and I went back to work at my workplace starting last week.  \n\nI hate being away from my daughter and my wife. My wife hates being limited to using Uber on the days I'm not home.  Or depending on our parents.  \n\nNow she is mad at me for going back to the office. I told her that it's her fault for not understanding that I was WORKING from home. Not just playing games in my home office.   \n\nI feel like an asshole and she says I am. But I am the sole breadwinner for our family.  If I got laid off because of her we would be in financial hardship.\n\n#EDIT\n\nWhy are people messaging me about a spray bottle?

If she had overheard any identifiable patient information you could have been liable for privacy issues (HIPAA if you're in the USA) which can be a fireable offense for employers. I'm presuming your wife is a SAHM which is perfectly fine as long as you're able to bring in income that meets your family's needs; without employment, you'd be kinda screwed on finances.", "NTA but this reeks of a larger pattern of problems that you should look into marriage counseling for...", "NTA.

Your wife is in need of some.kind of intervention. Because basically forcing you to go back to the office and then insulting you for it? That's abusive. She's not working against her own interests for fun, she's doing it for power and control.", "NTA. It says something that your 4 yr old daughter is better at following directions than your wife is. She has no one but herself to blame for the situation. You have to protect your job and she is incapable of respecting your working hours.", "NTA.  You wife couldn't respect your boundries and forced you back into the office.  I work from home and my wife doesn't leave for work until 9:45am.  We had similar issues but I rarely kept the door shut.  When I would shut the door, my wife knew I was probably in a meeting and wasn't to be disturbed. She understood that I was at work and need privacy at times.\n\nThe fact that your wife couldn't leave you alone while you are working is what drove you back to the office.  That's on her.", "NTA, sad your child understands work is work better than your wife!", "1. NTA, she's the one who failed to understand that work from home is **WORK** from home, not \"be at home and do work when you have a free moment\".\n\n2. The spray bottle thing is a reference to a recent post where someone in your situation did just that and sprayed his wife with a spray bottle when she tried to interrupt him.", "NTA but your wife is freaking dense and IS the AH.

It would be WWIII in my house if my spouse behaved like that.", "The spray bottle is a reference to another post where OP's wife refused to let them get a lock, so they sprayed them eventually\n\nYour solution is much better definitely NTA. Phones and messenger apps exist. There's no reason she NEEDS to come in at all.", "Your wife seems stupid", "NTA.\n\nI'm genuinely confused why your wife, whose bills you pay (and that of your whole family), cannot understand or respect that you provide for the family by a job, a job which you do frequently from home, in an environment that actually (by law, based on HIPAA) requires you to keep a professional and confidential environment. As you yourself said, your four-year-old can understand this.\n\nI would understand if this was a hardship/temporary COVID work-from-home situation, where you both had valid reasons to both be needing a similar space. But it seems you do have the space for a dedicated home office, and your wife isn't respecting this space or your boundaries.\n\nWhile I don't think you are TA, before going back to the office, I would have had a serious conversation with your wife about her lack of boundaries. To me, that seems grounds for a marital counselor to understand what's really going on. Is she codependent? Does she crave attention or affection that she might have reason to believe she's not getting? Are there childcare responsibilities or other things overwhelming her? Does she (whether consciously or not) want to sabotage your work?\n\nFor most families, WFH where both partners are home at the same time is a relatively new phenomenon that requires adjustment. But something deeper seems to be going on with your wife, and it's worth figuring out what that is.", "NTA. What kind of healthcare? Any chance your wife is very nosy and wants to eavesdrop on what patients are saying? Otherwise sounds like she can\u2019t handle having you nearby but not being with you at the same time.", "NTA she might be an adult but she\u2019s got to learn from the logical consequences of her actions.\nIf you wait you would all be dealing with the natural consequence which is you being unemployed", "Yeah I think closed door should be a pretty clear do-not-disturb indicator.", "NTA. Your wife was actively sabotaging your job. Her lack of respect and boundaries created this situation. You have a serious wife problem. She is will to jeopardize the only income in the house and is now upset that you wouldn\u2019t let her destroy your job.", "NTA. Her behaviour was endangering the family's livelihood! And she refused to respect that. Ultimately, her choices dictated yours. She needs to own her irresponsible behaviour and the consequence of it.", "NTA. The 4 year old understood better than the adult. That\u2019s really all you gotta tell her. I mean come on.", "NTA. She kept crossing your boundaries, now she lost the privilege.", "LMAO your edit.

I'm truly stunned at the number of posts I see like this. How is it that a partner can be so incredibly dense, especially when a 4 year old child gets it!?", "NTA. If your 4 year old daughter understands what a closed door means- and even tries to stop your wife/her mom- there\u2019s no reason why she can\u2019t too.

At first, it was only 1-2 days at home, but for the last 6-7 years, it\u2019s pretty much full time at home, only rare occasions going into the office. We have 2 children (15 & 7). \nWhile he\u2019s working, texting is the only acceptable form of communication if his office door is closed. If the door is open, we do a quick knock before asking whatever questions. \nYour wife doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend that while you may be in the home, you are still \u201cat work\u201d.

It speaks volumes that your four year old understood the assignment and your wife didn't. \nAs for the sprayer, much like a cat, your wife doesn't seem to give a f*ck about what you're doing and why you're doing it.

You are not the asshole at all, I truly don't get why she's so comfortable fucking with you when you are the only thing keeping your family housed.\n\nYou are doing the right thing by protecting your employment, but it sounds like you need to talk about her going back to work since she doesn't value your employment and does not respect the work you are doing. If she puts no value on how the sausage is made, she needs to start making her own sausage. That way hopefully y'all can amass the money to go to couples therapy and then send her to individual therapy. Because the root issue as to why she was willing to fuck with you like this needs to be found out and addressed", "Not only understand, but act on it and try prevent it being breached when she recognised it was happening. She's not going to get much success when contending with a full grown woman, but kudos to her for trying.", "Yep. Not going to lie, this is something I would find difficult to recover from in a marriage.\n\nNot the issue of home, or work, or working from home\u2026 but that my fully grown adult wife, with chin I am meant to be raising a functional human being, could be this wilfully ignorant.\n\nThis is not a difficult concept. Door closed = working. Working = not available. It\u2019s not as if she would waltz into OP\u2019s actual workplace, drop the kid off in the waiting room, and peace out to get groceries. Literally the second or third time this happened, I would have been having a serious sit down chat with her to figure out what in fucking tarnation she thought she was playing at. \n\nLike you said, their 4 year old daughter understands.

But my fiancee understands what me working from home means. She doesn't bother me, if she needs to ask someone or come in for any reason or needs me to come out, she will text me. The only thing she does that irritates me is when she wants me to do chores on my long days. Like i get a couple breaks a day, and i am absolutely not spending them cleaning shit. I will do chores and stuff on my short days, but my long days I'm basically up and at work the same time she is getting to work, and i don't get off until 4-5 hours after she gets off work. I don't have time for that. \n\nBut all that being said, NTA, your wife couldn't learn and now she has to deal with it.
