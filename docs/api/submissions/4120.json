I often discuss confidential information with clients and doctors.  I am not a doctor myself.  \n\nIn July of this year I finally had an opportunity to for employment that would give me the option of working from home.  \n\nI sat down with my wife and explained that this was a good thing for us.  I would be home three more days every week.  I would still be going into the office on Tuesday and Thursday.  But the other days I could skip out on the commute.  I could help with the my daughter in the morning and throughout the day. I could help with supper. I could see my 4 year old daughter more. \n\nNot all the time of course. I was still going to be working.  But our car would be home three extra days.  My wife could take our car and drop off our daughter with our parents or a sitter if she needed.  \n\nWe say and talked to my daughter and explained that even though I was home I could not spend all my time with her.  I explained that if the door was closed she needed to  knock quietly and ask permission to come in. And to accept it if the answer was no.  \n\nMy daughter understood. My wife did not.  She was constantly coming into the office when I was in meetings.  I had to excuse myself to get her out of the room.  More than once I saw my daughter trying to keep her out of my room.  One time my wife was trying to carry my daughter into the room and my kid was holding onto the door jamb so she didn't get in trouble for coming in when the door was closed.  \n\nI finally put a lock on the door.  She said she didn't like being locked out of a room in her house.  I explained that the door being closed and a sign saying that I was in a meeting didn't stop her.  She finally got the point. Until this thanksgiving. \n\nI was working on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and she needed to go buy something for our meal the next day.  And for some reason could not take our daughter with her. Or drop her off with either set of grandparents.  Or a drop in day care where we have a spot. \n\nShe instead decided to shake my locked door and knock until I answered.  I muted my meeting opened the door and told her to leave me alone until the end of the day.  She left and texted that my daughter was watching tv in the other room.  \n\nI talked to my boss and I went back to work at my workplace starting last week.  \n\nI hate being away from my daughter and my wife. My wife hates being limited to using Uber on the days I'm not home.  Or depending on our parents.  \n\nNow she is mad at me for going back to the office. I told her that it's her fault for not understanding that I was WORKING from home. Not just playing games in my home office.   \n\nI feel like an asshole and she says I am. But I am the sole breadwinner for our family.  If I got laid off because of her we would be in financial hardship.\n\n#EDIT\n\nWhy are people messaging me about a spray bottle?  She's not a cat.\n\nEdit #2\n\nThanks for the information about the other post that fit removed.  I am not going to do that.  I am going to buy a second car.", "created_utc": 1670358534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeh4oq/aita_for_giving_up_on_working_from_home_because/", "score": 3964, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Work is important and I always knew growing up with my mom (obviously way before video calls, but on the phone) that if she was on the phone with work dialing-in for a meeting and I was around, unless it was a true emergency, I was either to remain silent or go away until the call was over. I knew, understood, and could respect these boundaries even at the age of 4 years old. I knew not to mess with her livelihood. Your wife is an adult who understands how important having a good supportive job is.", "NTA. Your wife is more immature than your 4 year old.", "I have worked from a home office since 1992. From day one, the rule was door closed = do not disturb. It's not a hard rule to understand or follow.\n\nMy daughter was born in 1997. She knew since before she could talk that door closed = don't bother mommy.\n\nFor me the hardest part was hearing a crash, followed by toddler cries, and not taking action. Because if it was an actual emergency nanny would let me know; and the point of hiring a caregiver was to have someone I trusted to give care whether I was physically present in the house or not.", "I THINK people are saying get a spray bottle so that if she enters you spray her, of course she\u2019ll get upset, but, hopefully she learns.", "I was working from home in 2005, husband and 2 teenagers at home.  If my music was upbeat, 70's rock, they knew they could come in and ask a question.  If I was listening to classical music, leave mom alone, she is stressed.  It worked.  In fact, during one very stressful time, my cat died, and they didn't tell me for 2 days.  LOL Rational respectful people.", "She's got nothing better to do than interrupt her husband at work. What a dim wife. NTA", "NTA. Both my wife and I work from home. She works from her home office and I work out of my garage (now machine shop). I don\u2019t have zoom meetings. If I have a call I\u2019m on the phone, usually standing on the driveway. My wife is in zoom meetings most of the day. If I\u2019m in the house and I hear that she\u2019s on a call I don\u2019t talk to her. I send her a text. If my wife hears the machines going she knows that I can\u2019t talk to her either so she sends a text. \n\nIf neither are true then we talk. It\u2019s not hard to understand and be courteous to each other.", "Wow...well that's infuriating. I'm mad for you just reading all of this. NTA!", "NTA: you explained that when your door was closed, it as a clear sign that you can not be disturbed at that moment. If your daughter can recognise that, there is no reason your wife couldn't.", "NTA, as that title belongs to your wife as she has shown no respect for you or your job.", "NTA. You set reasonable boundaries that were so simple and clear a 4 year old could understand them. As a grown woman she has no excuse for her behavior. Now she can live with the repercussions.", "This reminds me of the one user who started working from home and his wife didn't understand the closed door rule so he started spraying her with a water when she opened the door", "NTA: OMG your wife sounds very entitled and arrogant.  I simply don't understand what she was thinking.  That is so sad. I feel bad for you!", "NTA! But ur wife certainly is!! Like u said ur the sile breadwinner in ur household and if u don't work, you'll be on the streets. Ur wife needs to respect that and has to also respect the fact that that there was a room that was designated for ur home office and um sure she would get mad at u if the tables were turned. \n\n As for ur daughter, it sounds like to me she's more mature and has more common sense than ur wife and she's ONLY 4. \n\n I believe u did a wonderful thing for ur daughter by going back to work in the office. If u continued to stay at home for work, u could of lost ur job, which meant u could of lost ur home, which meant ur daughter would of been living on the streets and it sounds like to me ur wife doesn't really care about her own child because all of this is just simple common sense, and u also did a great thing for ur own mental health. Someone who has someone barging in on them all the time and not listening to an utter word they say all the time would get pretty annoying. So u just think about the best things u did in this situation which is more than the bad u did and the good that u did in ur situation out weighs the bad majorly", ">Why are people messaging me about a spray bottle? She's not a cat.\n\nLol. Even cats aren't that stubborn. \n\nNTA. She didn't listen. She faced the consequences.", "NTA\n\nI also work from home but 100% of the time. I swear my kids (13 and 11) think I just sleep all day or dink around. Why do they have to do chores when they come home since I've been home all day? I should gotten them all done. \n\nNo kids. I'm WORKING from home. Do you want me leaving when you get on the bus at 7:30 and me not being home until 6 like I was pre-pandemic? No? Then do what you're supposed to do and I'll do what I have to to keep a roof over our heads.", "NTA", "NTA. My own wife understands this. We even moved our stuff to separate rooms so we don\u2019t bug each other. We even have hand signals for each other for when we\u2019re busy, in a call, just a moment, or not now.\n\nEven my cats understand to knock or meow outside the door if they want something (yes, they CAN and HAVE turned the handle to open the door before).", "100%. NTA.", "It's sad wifey ruined what was such a good situation for the whole family.", "Yeah. Does she have a reason for continuing to interrupt, because anything short of a kitchen fire is reason to stay away. It sounds like she has some serious issues with respecting boundaries.", "I can only see knocking on the door if it was a circumstance that would make me call them to come home immediately if they were in the office.  Like, this is an actual emergency.  Someone is going to the hospital.  There is a fire.  Something horrible is happening and I need my spouse *now.*\n\nNot realizing there is no cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving.", "Oh my God, we both work from home. Why do we not have a chocolate fountain?", "Ok ok, but think about a cheese fountain. That would be even better. I\u2019d break down the door for a cheese fountain if I were that wife", "Gotta disagree here... being home alone all day, caring for their child, without a car? I saw mention of using Uber.. but I can totally understand how she may feel trapped in the house with no car 5 days/week.", "I may take you up on that.", "What makes it worse is that the 4yo is more mature about this than an adult \ud83d\ude02", "I agree 100%. The first thing that came to mind was \"what a turn off\", if my partner acted like this our sex life would be effected, for at least a while. Nothing dries me up like irresponsibility. It also comes off as intentional, let's face it, the 4 yo could understand, are you seriously telling me she didn't know what she was doing when she stood there shaking that door? Nah. Ewww. Gross. No thank you.", "I couldn\u2019t agree more here. Every point is spot on. The sense of entitlement is through the roof. I bet she wouldn\u2019t be swanning around the same way if he lost his job. Unfortunately it sometimes takes something so drastic for someone like that to realise what\u2019s at stake. I think this guy gives far too much, even offering to help out in the day when he\u2019s working. What a guy. I don\u2019t feel like he should give in so easily. Sit with the uncomfortable conversation and aftermath for a while to add extra years onto his life, being able to spend time with his kid, it\u2019s his prerogative!", "Cats are smarter than that.  They domesticated themselves and developed a cry that sounds like a baby to get our attention.  meow. (smile)", "The *anxiety* I\u2019d be facing!", "Or a bit of a mix eh", "I was just thinking about this one lol", "As someone who's been the 4 year old, it's not necessarily a \"going places\" behavior, but could also be a \"I absolutely recognize this behavior causes conflict and pain and I'm going to do my kiddie-best to avoid that\" behavior.", "yep. Went through exactly this with my abusive soon to be ex. She demanded that she be my priority at all times. If I didn't leave work whenever she needed something, or didn't answer every text or call immediately, it proved I was putting my job before her", "I've worked at home for years in a room that is in the main house. My husband was out of work some of that time. He never interrupted me, because he's an adult ;)", "Very strict indeed. I worked at an insurance company when HIPAA came about. They did auto and medical insurance. After HIPAA, they separated the auto dept to one half of the building and medical to the other. Employees on the auto side were not allowed to ever go to the other side, first offense got you fired.", "HIPAA", "Yeah, that's the one that came to my mind because I didn't read the wife being sprayed post. That was a fun read", "No he can\u2019t. HIPAA doesn\u2019t have a private cause of action that an individual can pursue. There are some states that create private cause of actions, but without more info, this comment is misleading.", "As someone who also works from home and my partner keeps walking in and distracting me, albeit in a loving way with kisses or hugs, I get OP. NTA.", ">what in fucking tarnation\n\nCame here to say this. When my son was a newborn we slept in the living room because my wife needed 8+ uninterrupted hours of sleep before her 13+ hour shift in a hospital. I was on baby duty by myself for 23 hours straight. But she only worked 2 or 3 days a week and never consecutively. Her job kept us fed, we stayed as balanced as we could, we managed. I breeched that closed door exactly 1 time, when my fever was 105\u00b0 from mastitis. \n\nI also would consider this person too much of an entitled dumbass to remain married to.", "HIPAA Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is NOT to be taken lightly and wifey is just not giving even a quarter of a fuck. Then, when OP installed a much-needed lock, she flips the fuck out! If I cannot trust you to not leave me alone during my clearly set work time boundaries, so clear a literal 4 year old understands them, how can I trust you are respecting my work privacy/legal boundaries? I am seeing all the marinara flags.", "Had she asked for a car before? Did she say that's why she was bugging you while you were working?", "make your wife get a job.", "A stern talking isn\u2019t effective in this case. She is an adult who has made it clear she wouldn\u2019t listen. Something like divorce threats would make it.", "Most of the ones I've seen prior to this have been women working at home and the husbands barging in, I saw one recently that was very similar to this with the kid(s) understanding but the husband barging in. Makes me wonder if this is one of those troll posts where they switch the genders to see if there's a different reaction", "HIPAA", "Conflict resolution is a good skill to have! /s\n\nI have also been that 4 year old and I got a nice shiny spine from it."]}
