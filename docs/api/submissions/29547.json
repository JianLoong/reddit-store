But while they did not mention it directly, they made it sound like my wife or mom would feel  \\*less\\* or \\*not as important\\* if they were in the back seats.  \n\n\nI told them both that was childish and immature, that I loved them both and both are important to me equally. but that it would have had been nice for either my wife or mom to automatically take the back seat and offer the front seat to the other, because that would have been seen as less \"entitled\" or \"egocentric\", then I said that since that did not happen and they both are not getting into a solution and it was getting super late, I would throw a coin and whoever wins gets the front seat for the trip, did the coin flip and my mom won, so she went in the front seat and needless to say the tension during the trip was awful.  \n\n\nLater in the beach my wife said that I was an a\\*\\*hole for putting my mom first before her, and that she feels im still a \" mommy's boy \", I told her that was rude and her insecurities were starting to get to me, that I have never shown to her any preference for my mom over her, it has always been equal, because I genuinely love them both, my mom had always taken care of me since I was born and my wife will be the one I have a new family with, it sounds so stupid to have to choose one over the other  \n\n\nShe was upset and did not want to sleep on the same bed as me, when she asked to me go sleep somewhere else, I told her politely \" I would prefer for us to talk and fix this instead of sleeping , but if you want to sleep first, then I will not sleep somewhere else, if you want to go sleep somewhere else, go for it\".  \n\n\nThat did not sit well with her, she did not say a word, simple got up and went to sleep on the couch, I would like some input, so, reddit AITA ?", "created_utc": 1698098389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eweu8/aita_for_having_mom_sit_on_the_front_passenger/", "score": 350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing is, I don't know why your mother wanted to sit in the front, so I don't know if she was an AH or not, but if she did it just because she's used to it, then I really think she overstepped.\n\nIn this instance, anything you do will be taken badly by either party, but I would highly suggest you first try to appease your wife because that's the person you're supposed to spend the rest of your life with and showing her little consideration will take a toll on your relationship (you could see that yourself).

It's mean to make your elderly mom sit in the rear because her back might hurt, but if your elderly dad also rides with you, then it's totally ok to make mom sit in the rear (where her back might hurt), so that dad can sit in the front, because, actually what's driving this decision is not care for the elderly, but status.  Men are higher status than women so men go in the front seat. Older people are higher status than younger people so older people go in the front seat. Wives are lower status than mothers so wives go in the back. \n\nIn practice, it actually makes the most sense for the young, healthy person to sit in front because she's the one who'll be navigating. She's also the one who'll have to turn around to distribute crackers. I've sat in the back for long drives and I love it because it means I don't have to worry about the driving at all, but the front passenger is always bothering me to ask how to turn on the cold air, where's the hand sanitizer, do I have a blanket back there? Can I unbuckle myself to pass it to the front? And so on.", "No *auto*matic rule i think you mean.", "Same here, because typically the younger people are more agile and can sit in a smaller backseat whereas the older people can sometimes have mobility or comfort issues that are better suited to the passenger seat.

While I understand where other posters are coming from, in my country there's no need to be discussed. The eldest always in the passenger seat unless they really insist they don't mind otherwise.

I wouldn't see it as appropriate without a physical/medical necessity. The passenger seat is the copilot seat. Your chosen partner is your copilot. If you don't want them as such, you don't marry. \n\nIt's disrespectful to the spouse for anyone who doesn't have a NEED to impose themselves.

It says so much about this dude\u2026 and his mom", "Naw. I think all 3 of them are assholes.", "Omg I hate this mindset. Being older than someone else does not mean you need to be respected. Respect is earned and a 2 way street. \"She should have automaticly given the front seat to your mom\" even you are saying right there that it is in fact the wife's seat and she is the one with the authority to give it away. Its not the moms to just take! By just trying to take it the mother disrespected the wife first and the wife is simply matching energy. \n\nIf I have a really nice sound system, and someone close to me way throwing a party... I would probably offer the use of the sound system.

But I think the difference is that there are those of us who aren't in contentious situations with our in laws; we show them love and respect and they do the same. Then there are those who don't, for whatever reason, have the same situation. Then it's a symbolic contention. \n\nI've always insisted my in laws take the front seat, especially if the vehicle itself presents physical challenges for a parent. I know my very real husband would do the same. I also know our parents on both ends would gently and graciously put up a fight we wouldn't accept. Not everyone has the benefit of this. If the matter exemplifies a larger pattern of disrespect and no one is really physically hindered, then my parent or my spouse's would understand they are our guest.

His default should\u2019ve been to side with his wife.", "While this is the grownup thing to do, when it is a power struggle between you and mil it feels like a loss to give up the front seat.  My husband would give me the keys and let me drive and sit in the back.", "But it's your decision to do so.\n\nI do too, but my husband NEVER decided for me. I offer, and I usually have to insist because my MIL and my mom always say it's my spot (or his when I'm driving).\nGiven the fact that MIL was actually fighting for it, it's clear it was a power play and done on purpose.\n\nIf my husband ever said \"I love you both and I'm going to toss a coin to...\" while also assuming he gets to dictate what I do with OUR assets.

My MIL and I once (jokingly) argued insisting that the other one sit in the front.", "I bet that you are American.\nThis is a car.......NOT an airplane. There is no co pilot driving. Assuming that the OPs parents are elderly, 99 percent of elderly have medical issues just by the way of being elderly. Their bones are either frail or they have obesity and hard to fit into back seat.\n\nAs an eastern European woman, there is no way that I would feel threatened by a husbands relationship with his mum in this sense. Mummies boy is different. This is about having concern and respect elders.", "I might have told them they both had to sit in the back and told the 12 year old to sit up front.", "Ego lol obviously. OP should have just sat in the back and let someone else drive", "This was my first thought when I read this reply- noticed he wasn\u2019t willing to hand over the driver\u2019s seat. \n\nI\u2019m also someone that suffers from motion sickness though, so at least my husband takes that into consideration.", "The power struggle thing is weird. My husband and mom only argue about taking the back seat. He insists she rides up front as the elder and she insists he ride next to me. It\u2019s always brief and \u2018argue\u2019 is the wrong word but the opposite of this sounds strange. To insist on the front seat sounds childish imo.", "I love this idea.", "Haha! This is exactly what my husband does, and also I like driving. But, I didn\u2019t know the front seat had anything to do with who is more important. I thought the people in the back were important, given that celebrities and rich people always sit in the back. I don\u2019t think they have these problems lol. \n\nI would go NTA but maybe there is something else going on here, your wife shouldn\u2019t be insecure for no reason, not over a front seat. Neither should your mom stir up a ruckus either, hence, I think it\u2019s deeper.", "This was my thought!!! Is it not her car as well? Why does he get to decide? Just weird behavior from everyone.", "My son is an only child and I\u2019m still his Mums favourite \ud83d\ude02 behind our children of course.", "As I said. I am 64. I ran a 5k Saturday. I can sit in backseat.", "Oh hell no!! I definitely wouldn't be in the same car with her either!!! Won't let me into my house? These hands just got rated 'E' for everyone. Some problems solve themselves \ud83d\ude02", "Also from CA and spouse always sat up front in any relationship dynamic I was privy to witnessing. If ever it was different it was for elderly or spouse asked the other or offered to sit in back depending on the circumstances, but it was always the partners designated seat.", ">> The oldest person gets offered the most comfortable seat, doesn't matter who they are in the family. End of story\n\nSeriously. It's as simple as that. This fighting for status thing is ridiculous.", "That's a gross thing to tell kids. Many different kinds of love exist. The love between parent and child and the love between husband and wife are very different. The love I feel for my children is deep, strong, and nurturing. And it really is a beautiful thing. The love I feel for my husband is passionate, intense, and empowering. They're in no way comparable.\n\nAlso, \"why not allow\" the mother to have the seat is an admittance that the seat is the wife's to give away. The mother feeling entitled to just take something that was not offered to them is horribly disrespectful, and I don't blame the wife for not showing her respect in response.", "It's probably because you scared the misogynist troll who got his gang of incels to report you.", "You make a good point that I feel is being missed by so many people. Yes, OP should have his wife\u2019s back, but my goodness his mom AND wife were acting like children. I can\u2019t believe the whole drive was tense over this gigantically stupid thing. I stayed mad for hours about stupid stuff when I was 12, but now I\u2019m an adult and I also love and respect my MIL. So maybe ESH except the 12yo who seemed to have been the only adult. \n\nLike seriously, if I wasn\u2019t clear, I can\u2019t roll my eyes hard enough that this had to be a post. And for the record, I think it\u2019s a little weird OP\u2019s wife didn\u2019t choose to sit in the back to chat with her sister.", "That's much different. That's something offered to you by both of them out of love and respect. I'd give my MIL the front seat for the same reason. But the entitlement and arguing over it, is icky. And honestly OP seems quite amused by the whole thing so I bet ge gets off on having them \"fight\" over him and try to be number 1", "I always think - awww normal families when I see post and replies, then I filter it thru 2 decades plus with my in laws.\n\nI used to sit in the back, having a normal mother, grand, and great grandmother I got that older people sit in the front it's respectful.  \nThen I got my lovely JNMIL who viewed me as competition, I missed that letting her sit in the front was to her mind- winning.  \nSo now I sit in the front, Jesus, Kali, and Loki could come my MIL will always sit in the back.  \n\n\nBet OP's wife has a whole lot more to add to this post about her relationship with his mother, and why she decided to not back down.", "My 1 son and my dear DiL both insist I sit in front.  My other son and DiL I sit in back cuz I don't ever want to be seen to challenge her and I'm fine in the back with the grandkids anyway.", "There is difference, you are disabled and you need the front seat. OP's mother is plainly rude for going for front seat.", "This is the exception to the rule, and being a normal human being I bet you\u2019ve never tried to get into a competition over who your son loves more.", "Yeah, absolutely agree. As I mentioned in another comment above, my MIL has vertigo and I rather her be in the front than trying to make a point on hierarchy and having her sick in the car. It's about circumstances and mutual respect. This was kid-whining stuff. And the coin? Ugh.   \n\n\nBig props for the mutual love here!", "I was in my twenties when this happened, my dude. Chronically ill, me.", "Eh. Being old doesn't entitle you to respect. First and foremost, respect is a 2 way street! Arguing that she should sit up front and force his wife to sit somewhere other than beside her husband? That's one of those yellow flags of emotional incest. Whys she expecting to be treated like his wife?", "Official recommendation (and law in some states) is for kids to sit in the back until 13. \n\nBut yeah, after that fight I would have been inclined to make them both ride in the back, on the basis of them both being 10 years old so the 12 year old beats them out.", "Yes really weird they would argue over who gets to sit there, that is so sad.", "My wife always puts mom in the front seat.", "Plus wife had her guest in the back seat. Why wouldn\u2019t she sit with her?  I\u2019m sure sister didn\u2019t want to sit with MIL the whole way.", "Exactly.  It's harder for older people to get in and out of most vehicles' back seats.  I always sit in back if we have our parents with us and I'm not driving.  It's just polite.\n\nIf the wife has a problem with motion sickness while in the back seat, she could drive.  Then both women get front seats.  Problem solved.", "Especially with a two door car. It easier for an older person to get out from the front seat.", ">The last time I was angry about not sitting in front I was probably 13.\n\nYep, reading this I flashed back to every time I've been in a car with people in the past however long (not often), and realised I haven't witnessed a fight for the front seat between adults... basically ever? Maybe somebody got offended and I didn't notice that they weren't given the front seat, but the stalemate here was weird.", "The theme of this post is CHILDISH. \n\nMy brothers and I used to run to the car and knock each other down to get in the front seat. My mom would get so so mad. Like fuming mad. She\u2019d have stuffed us all in the trunk if it were legal. \n\nMy daughter and nephew who are close in age made a contract when they were like 10 where they agreed to always sit in the back together instead of fighting over the front. I was pretty impressed with them. The result was my slightly younger niece always getting the front since they were often all together. And everyone was always happy. Hey, maybe I can ask my daughter if she still has a copy to show OP\u2019s wife and mom.", "I always have my grandma in the front even when riding with my partner", "We usually let older or taller members ride shotgun because it\u2019s polite where I am.", "In my family it was 100% the opposite. My grandpa always offered the front seat to my grandma if one of my parents was driving. He would happily climb in back with the kids.", "I am American and always get in the back when a parent or someone older than me is also a passenger. Where I live, it is considered basic respect and good manners to do so.\n\nEven when I was in my twenties and my parents were in their early fifties, I did this.", "Especially since she's the only one who called SHOTGUN.", "\\^ This right here!", "Ok??? Are you ops mom?", "The fact that OP's wife said she thinks he's a mommy's boy, and that the MIL even thought it was appropriate in the first place, suggests that this is not an isolated incident.  Regularly being disrespected by your MIL, and your partner not having your back, can grow incredibly tiresome and frustrating over time, and then little things like these blow up.", "It sounds like there's bad blood between Mom and the wife that probably involves a longer story. However, it's the wife's truck too, and she gets dibs on the front. Mom should head to the back and wait to be offered the front seat unless someone has a legit medical reason for needing the front seat.", "I would have let the 12 year old sit in  the front and made the mom and wife sit in the back so that they were equal!", "12yo was riding on the vibe and laughing to themselves as if this was a kid's fight LOL", ">Like seriously, if I wasn\u2019t clear, I can\u2019t roll my eyes hard enough that this had to be a post.

Plus I would sit in the back with the person I invited!\n\nWife and mom seem ridiculous and petty IMO. Feel sorry for the 12yo that had to deal with them all on this trip", "Yes. Wife should have headed straight for the backseat to sit with her little sis who I am sure doesn\u2019t wanna sit by OP\u2019s mother FFS. It shouldn\u2019t have even been an issue. When they each saw the other going for the front, both had a chance to then be the adult. Both failed. OP correctly chose his mother for a single ride out of deference for the \u201crespect for elders\u201d concept. Hours later wife was acting like a total fucking baby bratz doll about it still. Longer than anyone would tolerate a child still whining about not getting shotgun. \n\nA wife and mother competing for the husband / son\u2019s affection is gross and pathetic. \n\nAsking parents to sit in the backseat while young able bodied adults get shotgun (effectively treating the parent of the adult as a child) is just disrespectful as hell where I\u2019m from. You just do not do that. Even to parents you don\u2019t like. It\u2019s a limited once in a while rare occasion thing. The wife here sucked first and then mom had to go join the suck party. OP should have left them both home and taken the kid sister to do something she actually liked.", "100% this!!", "It\u2019s just plain crazy. I have a great relationship with my MIL and FIL and I frequently offer them both the front seat out of respect. They are both older people although quite physically capable. I get told no, that seat is for me and they\u2019ll take the back.\n\nArguing over it just seems insane. It\u2019s the type of thing me and my sister did as kids, not two grown adults. If it was such a huge issue could they not have agreed to have it one way each? Ruining an entire beach trip day over something so petty (imo) just seems crazy to me", "The way this would have worked in my family is that usually with older family members, everybody insists they take the front, while they insist they don't need to, and it becomes a politeness fight for the back. OP is right in that this shouldn't have even been an argument - if I had a wife, I don't know what I would have done, but it feels weird that it's even caused this issue.", "I put my MIL in the front seat too because I like to keep my enemies where I can see them.", "I\u2019m glad I finally found another comment that said this. It just makes sense for wife to sit in the back so she can chat with little sis. Instead she made the whole drive suck for everyone because of her childishness (I do think OP\u2019s mom was also childish; neither should have acted like the supreme goddess of the front seat because they\u2019re not actually children).", "Because she was acting like an immature brat thinking she needed to compete with her own mother in law to put her in her place. Probably reading too much /justnoMIL on Reddit.", "If wife is young enough to have a 12 year old sister, for all we know this couple is young 20s and the MIL could be in her 40s-50s.

It could very easily have been his wife who had won the toss. \n\nNTA, OP.  Your wife and mother both were acting immature, and considering you love them both, the coin toss was very fair. \nYou were in hot waters with both of them either way the toss went.\n\nAlthough honestly, wife should have wanted to sit with her 12 y old sister who she had invited for the trip.", "OP's mother should head for the back seat. It's OP and his wife's car,  front seats are automatically given. OP's mother is the rude one whose  deliberately stepping on wife's boundaries.", "This. I'm surprised this is even an issue, in my country it would be pure manners for the older person to go on the front.", "Right? But as someone else said in another subthread... yes it is typically offered to the older person... but it is OFFERED because it is ours to offer. And that's the ticket here. It was the wife's seat to offer, not the mothers to just take. That's a huge sign of disrespect toward the wife and you cannot expect someone to be respectful while actively being disrespected.", "The difference is you offered. The other difference is that your in laws respect your relationship enough to say no. So not sure what you\u2019re getting at here. Why should the wife offer her seat?

No arguments then \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI agree with you and OP that it shouldn\u2019t have ever become an argument", "Yes!!!!", "Yeah, if I was the wife in this story, I would have automatically sat in the back, no questions. Especially as her 12yo sister was in the back as well.", "I agree, we were taught this way. It's also easier for older people use the front seat.", "I was thinking it would make sense to sit with your sister so she doesn't have to sit next to a lady she may not know very well. But I also don't really care where I sit so maybe that changes my opinion.", "I think there is way more to this story though. Clearly the wife feels disrespected by her husband when I\u2019m his mommy is around. If this was a one-off I would think it would be different. I am pretty sure that mommy asserts her power any time she is around the wife.", "I think most adults don't care, unless they're very tall and need the extra space, or have a (real) reason, like a disability and getting in the front is easier than the back.", "It seems these people have some kind of a power game going."]}
