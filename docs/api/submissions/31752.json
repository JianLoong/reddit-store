I know it's nosy, and I know it could cause drama, but I want to ask why my grandma and I were not invited. For a minute, I thought perhaps it was because of costs, but she comes from a well-off family, and I've seen firsthand that they never worry about money or costs. I'm feeling very hurt that they took my siblings but didn't think to invite me. It might be because I'm 18 now, but I only just turned 18 two weeks ago.

I'm assuming the siblings that went all live with dad? \n\nAre there any other siblings that weren't invited, or were you the only of either of their kids not to go?", "NTA for asking, but I'd do it carefully. Talk to your dad alone. It's OK to say you would have like to go along and felt a bit hurt that you weren't invited. Ask for information, but don't be accusatory or argumentative.", "NTA, I would be hurt too. I would talk to your father. I understand your grandma not going but you're his child. You were never told about the trip, until 5 days prior??? I would talk to him. Tell him how it made you feel. Also, if you don't like his answer, remember that. And be better. Know that you can choose who you want in your life. I don't know your story but always choose yourself.  It's not petty to ask, but definitely do ask. I'm 35 Female and I personally think that there is no good reason to not invite you. Hear him out, if he does it again after your talk, I would seriously consider distancing yourself. You don't need that stress.", "YWNBTA you should ask if you want but be prepared for an answer you might not like.", "Would you have had to miss school if you went on the trip?\nA 7 year old missing school is no big deal, but high school is more important", "NTA! I would also ask your stepmom why should would say \u201cSan Fran with the whole fam!\u201d when you weren\u2019t there.", "YWNBTA but you won't succeed by a group confrontation. Talk to your father alone (phone him maybe) right away and tell him that you feel hurt and would have liked to be included in the \"whole fam\" trips. \n\nThat post caption by your step mom is objectively hurtful, btw. You're not being sensitive.", "YWNBTA for asking. I mean, it\u2019s sad that they didn\u2019t invited you.", "Talk to your dad alone.", "NTA but I don't see what you hope to gain by asking.\n\nNothing that they could say will satisfy you.
