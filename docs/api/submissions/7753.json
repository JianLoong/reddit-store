My wife, on the other hand, is an extremely light sleeper, wakes easily, and often lies awake for hours at night. We have a 6 month old who's teething and going through sleep regression,  and my schedule recently changed to me having to go into work earlier. My wife is currently a SAHM and is the one responsible for the baby's care and house as I work 12+ hours a day and I'm exhausted by the time I'm home. \n\nBecause I'm a heavy sleeper it takes a lot and can take a while to wake me up. I'm currently getting up at 5am to get ready for work, which means I'm setting more alarms and over a longer period of time. My alarms are set to start at 3:30am and go off at 10 minute intervals until 5am to help me prepare for needing to get up. My wife absolutely hates this and gets mad at me for setting so many alarms since the first one wakes her and she can't get back to sleep before needing to get up with the baby in a few hours. She says if I'd just make an effort to get up on time instead of falling back asleep I wouldn't need so many alarms set. I responded I have to do it because I work and take care of everyone, it would be a bit different if I could play with the baby, relax during the day and nap when I want to. My wife got upset and snapped at me to figure out something better with my alarms as it's unfair to her, called me a dick for being dismissive of what she does all day, and ended up sleeping on the blow up mattress in the baby's room, locked me out and refuses to speak to me.

I would take a 12 hour work day over being a SAHP any day. Alarms from 3:30 until 5:00am, every ten minutes is absurd.

Get some Bluetooth sleep mask headphones and be a better husband.", "YTA\n\nLearn to wake up to the first alarm.  Get a vibrating / flashing alarm.

Being a SAHM isn't easy, her job is no less important than yours. And you are completely dismissive of her *needs.*\n\nYou need to figure out a new solution or your marriage is doomed. Silent alarms are a thing, you could see if those work for you. Set an alarm and have your wife wake you up, confirm you're awake, then go back to bed. Sleep in different bedrooms until you figure something out. But whatever you do, don't do what you are currently doing. This sounds like absolute torture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I responded I have to do it because I work and take care of everyone, it would be a bit different if I could play with the baby, relax during the day and nap when I want to.\n\nYou wouldn't last a single day caring for your child. And, clearly you've never actually had to care for your baby for an entire day. I'm child-free, have never even had to do more than babysit for a few hours, and yet I still have a far better understanding of how difficult it is to care for a child. Says a lot about the sort of parent you are.", "YTA.\n\nYour wife isn't playing with the baby and napping all day. She's changing diapers, feeding your child, bathing your child, cleaning the entire house, teaching your child, washing your laundry, taking your child to all the needed doctor's appointments, cooking food for you to eat, cleaning up after cooking food for you to eat, barely sleeping at night, and maybe getting a few winks in here and there during the day when the baby finally takes a nap.\n\nYour job is 12 hours a day. **Her job is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and it really doesn't seem like you do a single thing to help her.**\n\nYou are not \"taking care of everyone\" in the household.

You are preventing her from sleeping because you think you are more important.   Like being a sahm isn't 12 hours a day.  She isn't chilling and napping like it's a vacation.

This pretty much Chinese water torture for your wife.  It\u2019s inconsiderate and pretty much cruel. \n\nSleep in another room or work on setting 1-3 alarms.  90 minutes prior is insane.\n\nAnd YTA for saying that she has it easier.  You have it easier.  Jesus.", "You have a 6 month old, an exhausted wife, and an alarm set every 10 mins starting at 3:30am??? Are you from this planet?\n\nYTA\n\nThe fact that you think her day is just relaxing and playing with a baby makes you an even bigger one.", "I understand being a heavy sleeper married to a light sleeper. I'm the light sleeper in the relationship, but even so I came in here ready to say \"N T A\" for an extra alarm or two but DUDE. You have NINE ALARMS. A full HOUR AND A HALF of alarms. \nThat is OBNOXIOUS. THEN to blame HER? Get a pillow speaker and set your NINE alarms on your phone, hook the phone up to your pillow speaker so they don't wake up YOUR WIFE -- you know, the one that works *24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with zero downtime* taking care of your infant.\n\nBecause, dude, I GUARAN-FUCKING-TEE you that she's waaaaaaay more exhausted than you are. \nYTA for multiple  reasons.", "Holy shit YTA.\n\nAt the beginning of the read I thought you had a valid excuse but alarms at 10 minute intervals for 90 minutes? JFC my dude.\n\nAnd then, \"play with the baby and nap when she wants\". You think that's all that's involved in taking care of a baby at home? I'm a guy who doesn't have children but even I understand it's a LOT more than that.", "YTA. Big time. Taking care of the baby and house is work, not just \"relaxing and playing with the baby.\"\n\nIf you need 90 minutes of alarms at 10 minute intervals, you either have a medical condition or you just don't care about how you're affecting your wife. Either way, figure it out.", "YTA setting them at 3.30am through to 5am??? Dude, that is next level inconsiderate. I will say hats off to your wife however as I think she pinned it down right.", "YTA- I could not even finish reading your post. Your wife is working 24 hours a day sleep deprived and in the throws of some of the most challenging infant times. Not to mention cooking, cleaning and managing her husband\u2019s sleep. Go sleep on the couch or another room, it seems you could sleep anywhere/through anything. I can not believe how inconsiderate you are.", "An hour and a half of alarms???? You are lucky she locked herself away I would have hit you with it every time it went off. Get an alarm for deaf people. It goes under your pillow and vibrates your head off until you wake up.\nYou are torturing your wife who is trying to look after a baby plus the house alone for 12+ hours a day. \nStop it. Do better.", "YTA - Also, you're making yourself \\*MORE\\* tired by setting alarms an hour and a half earlier than you actually need to get up; you're preventing yourself from actually getting restful sleep during that time. An hour and a half of sleep interrupted every ten minutes by alarms is absurdly silly and terrible for actually getting rest.", "Yeah dude, YTA. For the alarms every 10 minutes and especially for being so dismissive of your wife. Wow.", "YTA. You CAN get up at the first alarm, but you choose not to, and you choose to subject your whole household to an hour and a half of this nonsense.\nOnce your kid(s) become fully sentient, you can bet that they'll share your wife (and the internet)'s view that YTA who makes them be done sleeping at 0330.\nTrain yourself to get up to the 'real' alarm.\nNot only will the family appreciate it, YOU will be getting better sleep, because that 90 minutes of interruption makes for rubbish sleep.\nI'd comment on your dismissive view of housework and child-rearing, but policy is only one judgment per comment (but it'd be similar).", "YTA and a massive one. She doesn\u2019t just get to nap, because there\u2019s shit to do while baby sleeps. Your dismissive tone tells me you need to spend a couple of days and nights alone with your baby because you\u2019re clueless. Setting an alarm 90 minutes ahead of time is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard of. If you struggle to wake up, set alarms at one minute intervals for the 15 minutes before you need to get up. The only reason to set one 90 minutes ahead is because you like to go back to sleep. Which is selfish and cruel.", "Everything you wrote is terrible. YTA big time. The two glaring points are the fact that you think that as a stay at home mom all your wife does is play with the baby and get to nap. The other one is that you actually are not getting any quality sleep. I\u2019m also a super heavy sleeper. You getting woken up by 9 alarms and snoozing in ten minute increments is way worse for you and also way less satisfying than setting three alarms 60-45 minutes out from wake up time.", "YTA given that your wife is suffering from extreme sleep deprivation if she's doing all the nights and being woken up every ten minutes from 3.30am. That's excessive.\n\nTwo things\n\n1. Get a smart watch that vibrates on your wrist as an alarm.\n2. Go to the doctor because it's not normal to be so heavy a sleeper that multiple alarms aren't enough to get you up. You might have an underlying medical issue.", ">My alarms are set to start at 3:30am and go off at 10 minute intervals until 5am to help me prepare for needing to get up.\n\nThat's insane, and alone would warrant a YTA in any scenario involving you living with anyone, but especially in a household with someone who is a light sleeper AND tending to YOUR infant.\n\n>She says if I'd just make an effort to get up on time instead of falling back asleep I wouldn't need so many alarms set. I responded I have to do it because I work and take care of everyone, it would be a bit different if I could play with the baby, relax during the day and nap when I want to.\n\nYou have no appreciation for what your wife does. Taking care of the house and all its duties as well as a teething infant going through sleep regression IS a full-time job and isn't worth any less than the labor you do because SHE IS RAISING YOUR CHILD. Get a grip and stop being selfish OP, the LEAST you can do as a parent and partner is set one fucking alarm.", "3:30 to 5am. I would have left your bed along time ago or never got into it. Don\u2019t pull that stupid SAHM crap on your wife unless you\u2019re also helping out when your get home. Otherwise shes just a glorified maid-baby maker and YTA.", "You are such an AH that it made me angry reading this. REGARDLESS of any context, it is beyond unreasonable to make your partner suffer through an HOUR & A HALF of alarms going off every 10 min. Even if you didn\u2019t have a baby and your wife didn\u2019t have trouble sleeping. Who tf makes someone put up with that? \n\nBut then adding the context that you do have a baby and your wife is sleep deprived as it is, AND you absolutely do not respect her or view her caring for your house and child as work, YOU ARE A MASSIVE AH!!!!!!", "YTA You're an asshole for the alarms. You're an asshole for not caring about your wife's sleep needs (do you even like her?). You're an asshole for thinking that taking care of a baby is just relaxing and napping whenever she wants.", "YTA. I had a job in my twenties where I worked 12hrs per day and often 6 days per week, but i remember those newborn days and they were so much more exhausting. It was like sleep deprivation torture; I walked around like a coffee-seeking zombie everyday, in a complete fog, wondering how I was still upright whenever the baby needed me. She can't just sleep whenever she wants. That's not how babies work.\n\nEdit: by 'she' I mean wife", "YTA. I was on your side, until you said your alarms start at 3:30 am, when you don\u2019t get up until 5 am. It would be different if the alarms started at 4:30 or 4:45. I have 2 alarms set for my mornings. I have to be up by 6:45 am. My first warning alarm goes off at 6:30 am, and my second alarm goes off at 6:45 am. The first one is a warning that I have 15 minutes before I have to get up with my second alarm. 2 alarms are much different than 10 alarms going on for an hour and a half. What does an alarm do every 10 minutes, other than disturb your sleep, and obviously your wife\u2019s sleep? What makes you get up at 5 finally? Looking at your clock and seeing it is 5? Then set 1 or 2 alarms and you will still see that it is 5 am, and time to get up. Your wife is exhausted with a new baby, and being full time care for that baby because clearly you don\u2019t get up with the baby. Do something for your wife, and don\u2019t just think of yourself, and cut the alarms down.", "YTA for taking away 1.5 hours of sleep from a mother of a baby and YTA for dismissing how  much work it is to care for a baby all day. Just reading this just made me angry, I can't believe it took your wife this long to lock herself in the baby's room with a blow up mattress and stop talking to you.", "YTA - 90 minutes is completely unacceptable.", "YTA. Not only have you have decided that she is going to wake up every day at 3:30 in the morning, you are being completely disrespectful of the fact that she is spending all her time taking care of your child. Grow the hell up.", "YTA. \n\nI feel extremely sorry for your wife. She is dealing with a baby and a grown up toddler.", "YTA for both setting alarm to go off for 1 and 1/2 hours before you actually get up and for being dismissive of what it takes to raise a child.", "YTA, literally sleep in a different room if you need this many alarms. And the way you dismissed her caring for your child like she\u2019s on vacation or something is gross", "YTA. So instead of working with your wife to find compromises, you told her she does nothing all day, can nap when she wants, and that you\u2019re more important because you have a paying job? And you seriously don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s mad? Guarantee your wife is working harder and longer than you and has reached a level of exhaustion you don\u2019t know exists. \n\nEven if you didn\u2019t have a new baby, someone setting an alarm 1.5 hours before they have to get up to \u201cprepare themselves\u201d to wake up is just an AH. You\u2019re disrupting your entire household instead of solving your own issue.

Is your child seriously neglected?", "Ok I was going to say that you were ok because my gf also sets a lot of alarms, but needing an hour and a half of 10 alarms going off is completely unreasonable. I get frustrated with half an hour of alarms. Your poor wife. YTA.", "YTA, was just having this conversation with a friend who's wife does this and both of us are the type that once woken, there is no going back to sleep. It is so inconsiderate to your partner and so very much your problem that you force on her. Figure it out. Sleep through one alrm enough and have consequences and maybe you'll figure out how to get up the first time. Alarm goes off, stand up. Period.", "Yea\u2026 you\u2019re the AH in this one. Two and a half hour lead time of alarms before getting up is nuts. Maybe try looking into sleep cycles and plan alarms around that? \n\nAs a light sleeper with trouble falling asleep I envy your ability to sleep heavily. \n\nBeing a Stay at home mom is also a full time job. Instead of 12 hours it is 24 hours. Despite working 12+ he shifts, being the one responsible for baby\u2019s care and house work alone is crazy, it\u2019s a lot of unseen labor that if they were actually paid for it would amount to a $120k annual salary. Just saying to put it into perspective. \n\nSleep is so crucial for both of you, and a lack of sleep, (or even compassion / empathy for what the other person does) can be harmful to a marriage. \n\nA lot of couples sleep in separate rooms when it comes to varying work schedules. That may help too. And lastly there are other types of alarms that might be good and not disturb your wife. I think there is one that is like wristband that vibrates? It sounds like both of you are doing what you can despite the tough situation. Hope your situation gets better!", "YTA. You can't do this to your wife, waking her all the time at 3.30 when only you have to get up. You better start sleeping in the guest room with the door closed on working days so your alarm does not bother your wife. With these weird sleeping hours you probably have sex only during the weekend anyway, so there is nothing lost to the two of you sleeping separately on working days.", "You\u2019re a massive dick. YTA", "YTA in this situation, you work long and hard days yes but... 90 minutes of snoozing with 10 minute intervals? Thats not helping you get the rest you need and while that would be fine if it only affected you but it is not, when it affects her sleep schedule aswell then it is not ok!   \nI can think of 3 things that you can do to get up on time.  \n1: put your alarm clock far away/ high up so that you have to get up and stretch to turn off the alarm.   \n2: get a light clock (helps your body realize it is morning even though its dark outside)   \n3: drink ALOT of water before going to bed. (helps with sleep quality and will urge you to go to the toilet when you wake up)\n\nAlso you are dismissing what your wife is doing during the day which is not a good look for you either.", "YTA. The ways things are now your wife doesn't get to sleep. And extra YTA for insinuating that your wife has it easy with just playing with the baby, relaxing during the day and napping when she wants to.\n\nGo sleep somewhere else. And the reason why it takes you an hour and a half to wake up is because you don't get enough sleep.\n\nSleep in another room, put the alarm clock as far from you as possible, so you need to get up to turn it off and become a little more disciplined. When you are up, you are up.", "YTA put your alarm clock/phone on the opposite side of the room and get up after the FIRST alarm and thank your lucky stars that she hasn't already tried to murder you in your sleep", "Omg YTA. I would sleep in a different room if I were your wife. And it sounds like you think being a SAHM is easy. Even if you work 7 days a week, at 12 hours a day, your total is 84.

You were the AH for being 100%, ENTIRELY self-involved and not considering anyone else's needs but your own. But then you . . . well, let's put it this way:\n\nYou are absolutely allowed to have what you NEED to wake up and get to work in the morning; but given your wife's comment about you \"going back to sleep\", the implication is that this ongoing, intrusive series of alarms isn't actually what is NECESSARY to simply wake your responsible adult self up and get you out of bed to get ready for work. Rather, it's your PREFERENCE, so that you can slowly ease yourself out of sleep whilst hitting a bunch of snooze buttons over a long period of time, doze a little, all the while disturbing your wife's ability to get a proper rest *before she has to spend her day being solely responsible for the safety and care of your baby.* So first of all, YTA for messing with her sleep to prioritise your preferred method of waking up, instead of just getting yourself one really good alarm for a reasonable time.\n\nBut then, as if you weren't already being an AH, you did THIS:\n\n>I responded I have to do it because I work and take care of everyone, it would be a bit different if I could play with the baby, relax during the day and nap when I want to.\n\nI'm sorry, you're \"taking care of everyone\"? No. You're earning money. Apparently you haven't even MET, much less spent any significant amount of time caring for, your own child, because if you had, you'd know how ludicrous this statement is. Playing, relaxing, and napping when she wants to? What fantasy world are you living in? This woman is tending to the constant needs of a tiny, helpless human. Her day likely consists of an endless stream of feedings, diaper changes, cleanups (both baby and environment), laundry, trying to calm a fussy baby who cannot communicate except, again, through crying . . .  \n\nWhat you said to your wife was not only shockingly ignorant, it was HATEFULLY condescending. It wasn't just disrespectful, it literally told her that you have so little interest in her life and that of your child that YOU HAVE NO IDEA what their lives even ARE from day to day.

Your wife also takes of your child, youre not the only one taking care of people, just financially. I assume she is also taking care of you by doing housework and cooking. And shes right, you have no clue or appreciation what she does all day if you think she can nap whenever she likes, or even when the babies asleep.

Let me rephrase what you just said to your wife:\n\n\u201cHey honey, I know you shoved a watermelon out of your vagina/got massive abdominal surgery having a literal organ torn to give birth to our baby, you have bleeding nipples that hurst and the mother of all hormone changes raging through your body, you are going through the kind of sleep cycles being rudely awaken at every hours of the night AND day that qualify as inhumane torture under the Geneva convention, and you can\u2019t get any respite because when you are not caring for the tiny human WE BOTH created but YOU are solely responsible for, I still hold you responsible for all of the shit that needs doing around a house that would usually require a full time person to do. But I have decided I can\u2019t be a grown up about waking up so you have to suffer more.\u201d\n\nAgain. YTA. \n\nYou have a full time job, so does she - caring for that baby.

I had something similar, slept through alarms, heavy sleeper, falls asleep in 20 seconds, couldn\u2019t wake up, etc. turns out I stopped breathing periodically when sleeping so I never felt rested.

Download an alarm app that makes you solve a math problem before it will shut off. Plug your alarm in across the room so you have to get out of bed earlier when it goes off.

Raising a baby isn\u2019t \u201crelaxing\u201d, keeping the house clean while raising a baby isn\u2019t relaxing, doing all of the chores and errands isn\u2019t relaxing, getting zero breaks from a constantly crying baby isn\u2019t relaxing. You belittle your wife because you think she\u2019s less than you are or that your job is harder - you work 12 hours and come home and rest for 12 hours. She doesn\u2019t get that - she has to cook for you, clean for you, take care of YOUR baby for you - tell me, when can she truly sit down and say \u201cthis is me time as I\u2019m currently off work\u201d. She doesn\u2019t. She doesnt \u201cget off\u201d work, it\u2019s a 24 hour job. I\u2019d love for you to reverse the roles for just a week and see how exhausting it is for you. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure why you feel the need to absolutely belittle your wife, though.

Crazy. \n\nIf you need multiple alarms like that, sleep in another room. She\u2019s exhausted from taking care of 2 children all day, every day. She needs her sleep. If she\u2019s sleep deprived and needs to take your child to the emergency room and falls asleep at the wheel, will you start to care then? Only after your wife gets into an accident and nearly passes will you begin to understand that she needs sleep to function?

You provide money for your family and that\u2019s just about it. \n\nWho even needs to set an alarm in 10 minute intervals for an hour and a half? That\u2019s literally insane.

I\u2019ve slept through massive storms, tornado warnings, a tree branch falling on our home, a storm so bad it flooded half my town and downed trees all over the area, being shaken awake, etc. I also sleep walk (rare). I like to wake up and go back to sleep so I set 2 alarms: one at 5am and the other at 7am (when I need to wake up), and if it\u2019s the weekend/day off after a night of drinking and I want to be awake by a certain time, I set staggering alarms every 1-2 hours. BUT when I\u2019m sleeping beside someone, I don\u2019t do that. I only do it when I\u2019m alone or if they wouldn\u2019t hear it (sleeping in another room, for example).\n\nHonestly, you need to do 3 major things before your marriage begins to go downhill FAST:\n1) Respect your wife and the work she does. She doesn\u2019t get a break taking care of 2 children all day. (You and your infant, if that wasn\u2019t clear)\n\n2) if you don\u2019t already, help around the house. (I\u2019m betting for sure you don\u2019t) She cooks, you do the dishes. Take turns getting up in the night for your child. It\u2019s both of yours and requires equal responsibility. If it cries, say, 5 times, you get up twice. If the sound of your baby crying doesn\u2019t wake you up, you better learn that life skill.\n\n3) stop setting so many alarms. 1-2 is enough. Learn to be an adult and wake up on time. Or, sleep in another room.", "Just sleep in different rooms. Now both can sleep and you can use your alarms. Problem solved", "YTA.

I trained myself down to two alarms, 20 minutes apart, and now people in my household are happier. You need to be able to throw yourself out of bed when you know you have to get up.\n\nNow onto your wife: taking care of a baby is a full time job. She has to be up at random intervals to take care of the baby at night, she has to care for them all day, feed them, make sure she finds out why they are fussing, change diapers, etc\u2026. At the end of the day, she can\u2019t even get a good rest because of you (and your outrageous amount of alarms). She must be pulling out her hair because of her daily stress and lack of sleep!

So, I switched it to something different and now I pretty consistently wake up to it.\n\nIf you're actively hitting snooze and falling back asleep, move the alarm across the room from you so you're FORCED to stand up and turn it off. Then, immediately walk yourself into the bathroom and shove your face into cold water. Snoozing the alarm that often, that early, is a huge jerk move.\n\nIf you're not snoozing it and you're just sleeping straight through it, you might want to look into a sleep study and see what's going on that you're genuinely unable to wake up. Could indicate a health issue.\n\nOr you could make an arrangement with your wife - you set your alarm for the appropriate time, she inevitably wakes up, and if you aren't up she grabs a spray bottle and sprays you with cold water in the face until you get up.

My wife, on the other hand, is an extremely light sleeper, wakes easily, and often lies awake for hours at night. We have a 6 month old who's teething and going through sleep regression,  and my schedule recently changed to me having to go into work earlier. My wife is currently a SAHM and is the one responsible for the baby's care and house as I work 12+ hours a day and I'm exhausted by the time I'm home. \n\nBecause I'm a heavy sleeper it takes a lot and can take a while to wake me up. I'm currently getting up at 5am to get ready for work, which means I'm setting more alarms and over a longer period of time. My alarms are set to start at 3:30am and go off at 10 minute intervals until 5am to help me prepare for needing to get up. My wife absolutely hates this and gets mad at me for setting so many alarms since the first one wakes her and she can't get back to sleep before needing to get up with the baby in a few hours. She says if I'd just make an effort to get up on time instead of falling back asleep I wouldn't need so many alarms set. I responded I have to do it because I work and take care of everyone, it would be a bit different if I could play with the baby, relax during the day and nap when I want to. My wife got upset and snapped at me to figure out something better with my alarms as it's unfair to her, called me a dick for being dismissive of what she does all day, and ended up sleeping on the blow up mattress in the baby's room, locked me out and refuses to speak to me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I got 4 hours last night thanks to my dogs. Even if I tried to take a nap I couldn't. I'm physically incapable of sleeping when the sun is up.  It's even harder to do when you have a little you need to keep slightly awake and alert about all the time. \n\n\nI want to to try an experiment: when you go to bed tell yourself what time it is now and what time you want to wake up at.  If you need to tell yourself how many hours you have to sleep do that.  Set it in your mind that you will wake up at x time.  See if you can't wake up faster and more alert with less alarms when you mentally set a time.  I do this and 9 out of 10 times I wake up a minute before my alarm goes off. I believe more people are capable of an internal clock than they realize and heavy sleepers convince themselves they don't have the capacity to wake up so they require a barrage of alarms for hours. Play with training yourself to wake up at different times and see if you can't improve at least the amount of time it takes to wake up. 90 minutes of alarms is asinine.", "Duh.

If you\u2019re lucky they\u2019ll nap on a schedule, and you\u2019ll spend that time on chores if your husband does nothing around the house. Do you think your light sleeping wife gets to sleep for the duration of your baby\u2019s naps? \n\nWhat would happen if you were caring for the baby and you had a nap - it takes you 90 minutes and 9 alarms to wake up in the morning. Would your crying baby wake you? Or would you fall asleep and not wake when your baby is wet and hungry? Would you be happy if your wife did that? \n\nYou\u2019re torturing a woman who\u2019s already sleep deprived from caring for a newborn, and who\u2019s responsible for everything around the house too because you\u2019re \u201cexhausted from work\u201d. \n\nHave you spent any stretch of time caring for the baby alone? Do you know how exhausting it is? She is exhausted too. You\u2019re putting everything else on her, so she can\u2019t even rest when the baby does sleep in the day because you think she should be responsible for everything. You think you should work 12 hour days five (?) days a week and she should be on duty 24/7. She is going to break. \n\nWhile you\u2019re at work, she\u2019s caring for your baby. Do you get the risk of her being in sole charge of a baby for 12+ hours a day, and doing all the night care because you\u2019re a heavy sleeper, and doing all the chores if and when the baby sleeps during the day? \n\nThe risk of your wife falling asleep while holding the baby on the sofa or similar is huge. And what little sleep she could get, and desperately needs, there\u2019s an alarm going off every ten minutes for 90 minutes of that. \n\nYou need to sleep in another room or resolve this alarm issue, pick up more slack at home and do at least one overnight when you don\u2019t have work in the morning. You are endangering her health, physical and mental. What will you do when she\u2019s so exhausted she can\u2019t care for your baby at all? Sleep deprivation is used as a torture for a reason, the baby is doing it and now so are you. The poor woman must feel absolutely besieged. \n\nMy husband worked, and shared overnight care. When I went back to work too, we continued sharing overnight care. Working was easier. We had twins and I was pumping because they couldn\u2019t latch. If my husband didn\u2019t help, I would never have slept at all. We were both knackered, that\u2019s what happens when you have a baby. You are *both* exhausted, you need to support each other and find ways to survive this stage - separate rooms, sleeping in shifts, getting a cleaner if you can afford it, getting a day off each at weekends to rest\u2026 it doesn\u2019t last forever but this is a recipe for disaster.\n\nYou really need to experience first hand the reality of caring for a baby alone because frankly you are absolutely clueless about what your wife is doing.

It's a very hard work, she is no less exhausted than you are. That being said, why can't she wake you up in the morning? If the alarm wakes her up anyway, she can shake you awake and then go to sleep herself, this way you only need one alarm.", "YTAH. If you hadn't said the bit about playing with the baby and relaxing all day I was going to suggest a compromise but you suck. Babies are non stop and you should try spending a week at home with the baby on your own. If the baby does sleep for an extended period of time which they often don't and sleep in fractious fits and starts, it doesn't mean your wife can automatically switch off and sleep too. She has a million things she needs to do in those precious minutes anyway", "Oof. I don't think you are an asshole for the alarms but are definitely an asshole for what you said to her. You definitely demeaned her with what you said and it was uncalled for. Now, the alarms do seem a bit excessive and it's very obnoxious of you, and a bit rude that you don't seem to care about your wife being able to have a proper sleep. You should try to come to a compromise. If you need the alarms, then that's fine, but don't have them playing for 1 hour and a half. If you are living with someone you need to be conscious of that.", "I sympathize on the multiple alarms, some people cannot just change their circadian rhythm but still need that to get up for a job.  \"Just get up earlier\" is not a solution.  You are NTA for setting the alarms as a necessity to get up and go to work but YTA for dismissing your wife's responsibilities as a SAHM.  That is exhausting work and she can't just relax during the day and nap whenever she wants.  You need to also respect her need for sleep in addition to your own.  Since the alarms are interfering with her sleep, you both need to compromise and find a solution, whether it is separate bedrooms temporarily until the child gets older, you getting medical help if there is a sleep issue, or maybe she'd be open to the alarms being less ahead of time, like trying 15 or 30 minutes early instead of 90 minutes so the disruptuon is for a shorter period.

I still have to use my CPAP nightly, and if i am REALLY tired I will use my shock watch to make sure I absolutely wake up. Usually I don\u2019t need it. The alarms are annoying. Like I said, different sleeping arrangements need to be made until then.", "Yeah..... I generally hate when people here cross the line from \"reading between the lines\" to \"making shit up\" but... it's reeeeeeally hard to believe someone is *unaware* that blaring noise for an hour and a half every morning is annoying.", "It would be sleep deprivation which is considered torture. Torturing non-combatants is a violation of the conventions I believe.", "Totally 3 hours of sleep then 9 alarms is great. I mean when I was working 60 to 70 hours a week it would have been great to hear almost a dozen alarms.", "And you\u2019ve done lots of research into sleep cycles, sleep hygiene and seen a doctor over it taking an hour for you to wake up? Brains learn and are malleable so you can rewire how they\u2019re programmed. You might be over sleeping, you need to learn about the different types of sleep, light exposure etc", "Yeah, lemme just rewire my ADHD, autism, delayed sleep phase disorder, and chronic pain away.\n\nI've done extensive research on sleep, it's been one of my hyperfocuses on many occasions. Sleep hygiene helps, but it's not a cure all for everything.", "You\u2019re right, we should all just accept the disorders we have and give up on attempts to improve ourselves, stop taking medications and put therapists out of business"]}
