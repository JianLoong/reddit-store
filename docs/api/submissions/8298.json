Occasionally my parents will point that out, like I don't know.

No news is probably bad news...).", "I thought it was the opposite: they think OP is hiding something (since they're parents, I'm going to assume they fear STDs/pregnancy).\n\nNTA OP, though, yes they may indeed kick you out.

This is a huge impact on them, as well as you. Of course they want to know what is going on, and want to make sure you have the best and most effective treatment. Keeping them in the dark is a bad idea.

Consider the fact that it is illegal for medical professionals (among other professions) to share your data with third parties. You choose the information you divulge as a patient.

No good doctor would diagnose that way, but they absolutely could usefully suggest things OP's actual doctors should test for.  Source: my sister is a doctor, and I was involved in a similar situation.  A colleague mentioned her father was and had some strange eye/pupil issues.  The doctors at his local hospital couldn't find anything, so she asked if I would ask my sister.  She thought it could have been a hormone-producing tumor somewhere else in his body, but I believe her direct quote was \"he's really sick and needs to get the hell out of BFE.\"  I don't know what happened after (because, none of my business), but that colleague did come up months later to say \"your sister is a genius.\"  \n\nOP, if you're sick enough you can't work and your doctors can't figure out what's going on, you really should seek additional medical advice.

My mom would tell every other family member\n2. My parents would ask me about it every day. It's too much. It's overwhelming, it's suffocating. \n3. I would have to manage my mom's emotions around any health news. Just no. I have enough dealing with my own emotions around health concerns.\n4. some people are just more private", "According to OP's comments, they are hiding things (like liver issues among other things) so I'd put money on they definitely are thinking OP's hiding things.", "The negative would be OP sharing something they don't feel like sharing. There can be many reasons for this. For example, having to manage their (the parents) emotions. Sometimes it's too much.

That\u2019s extremely fortunate for me that it was caught so early and the only reason it WAS caught was because of the doctor my grandmother had worked for.  I was visiting for 6 weeks that summer prior and working in the office.  They knew that I had been having a lot of pain in my various joints and the doctor tested me for Lyme disease among other things.  Well, the results came back partially positive so they told me to find an internal medicine specialist when I got back home.  My dad found one, set the appointment up, and while that doctor sucked, he set me up a referral for my rheumatologist who has quite literally been a godsend.  He treated me for the Lyme disease but also ran some more blood work and this time, my ANA was positive and they could officially diagnose me.  It was a perfect chain reaction of events to get me where I needed in life and if it wasn\u2019t for then doing that bloodwork over the summer, it would have probably been years before being diagnosed, I\u2019d be far sicker, and I would never have met my current doctor.\n\nEdit: also, NTA, your medical information is just that: YOURS.  Your parents don\u2019t need to know every single little detail of your health, all they need to know is what YOU feel comfortable sharing.  Don\u2019t back down.  Also, always advocate for your health and best interests.  Do research.  Ask questions.  Be as informed as you possibly can.  Just don\u2019t passively let others do it all for you.  That\u2019s the best advice I can give.", "So glad to hear you got diagnosed quickly (at least quick for lupus)!", "I have never received my blood type information on any bloodwork I\u2019ve done throughout the years (and I\u2019ve done a lot - not to brag but I\u2019m a ~medical enigma~) so if this is their concern odds are that information isn\u2019t even on their tests. I also bet they think OP is hiding something (or are just concerned and nosey) rather than the other way around."]}
