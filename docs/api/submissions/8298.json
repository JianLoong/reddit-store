Would you not want to know if they were sick. Why did you tell them about your health issues in the first place.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to share with them if you don\u2019t want to. And don\u2019t feel like you should because you are living there. They are not allowed to discuss this kind of information with their friend who is also a doctor. Your own doctor can give you advice and your doctor is not allowed to discuss anything with your parents.\n\nYou parents sound a bit abusive and/ or controlling to me. Please move out if you are able to. It might be better for your own wellbeing.", "NTA but if you live with them and they're supporting you (insurance, payments, housing etc) than you should probably give it to them.", "And 4. Move", "The trouble is they have no entitlement to the information and plan to run to their doctor friend with it", "They are not paying for it anyways. But very controlling of you...\nSorry for your kids if yoy have them.", "They just need to learn that you're 24, not 14. You love them but you also have the right to medical privacy.", "I agree, sounds like they are doing that already and there isn\u2019t realistically anyway to stop them doing that even if OP doesn\u2019t give them the test results. But it is still unsolicited advice Chinese whispers style and OP doesn\u2019t have any obligation to listen to them.", "Guy's 24 living at home.", "Can't speak for OP, but my parents will constantly ask about things or they make the most useless and annoying suggestions. If there's something wrong, sometimes you don't want to think about that for awhile, but that becomes impossible if people won't respect your space and not ask about it. \n\n(Currently overweight. Occasionally my parents will point that out, like I don't know. The problem is psychological, yes I know exercise will help, yes I know eating less calories will help, but that won't fix my brain making those things difficult rn). \n\n(The other common one people have is job hunting. No news is probably bad news...).", "I thought it was the opposite: they think OP is hiding something (since they're parents, I'm going to assume they fear STDs/pregnancy).\n\nNTA OP, though, yes they may indeed kick you out. Some parents just can't figure out their child's autonomy (even when they don't live with them).", "I can\u2019t wrap my head around what negative it would bring you to mention this other thing too?\n\nI get you don\u2019t wanna just have them look at everything, but like if I break my leg, and later get the flu, I don\u2019t see the negative effect of mentioning the flu\u2026?", "Blood type incompatible with being the blood child of both parents is very possible."]}
