I (38f) have 2 children (10f and 15m). My mother lives close by and she is very much involved with my kids. A wonderful grandmother. Her husband and I have always had a difficult relationship- they have been together over 20 years. He is very old school in his child raising tactics and part of that generation where talking about your feelings is unacceptable. We just do not see eye-to-eye on many subjects and are comfortable with just ignoring each other at this point. \n\nMy own father passed away 15 years ago so he has always been grandpa in the kid\u2019s eyes. I have never disparaged his name in front of my children and very much appreciate that he has taken on that role for nearly 16 years. \n\nAbout 8 months ago- he was diagnosed with multiple aggressive forms of cancer. Surgery is not an option and he was given 12 months to live WITH chemo. I know all of this in real time because my mother would regularly update me against his wishes. He did not want anyone to know. Months later he asked my mother to call me and have me come over so she could tell me. We staged this conversation in front of him and shortly after told my son as we knew he would be able to keep that information to himself. \n\nLast night putting my daughter to bed she starts sobbing and tells me that she is afraid that grandpa is going to die. This is completely out of character for her so my heart sank realizing she has caught on. He has rapidly declined over the past 2 months both physically and cognitively. She\u2019s a smart girl and she can see it. \n\nI texted my mother this morning and told her what happened. She said that he would like her and I to come over so he can tell her the truth. \n\nHe started off by accusing her of \u201chaving a bad night\u201d (last night) and asked why she was so upset. She was visibly uncomfortable with his tone and demeanor as was I. I reminded her what she said last night then he just repeatedly asked her what she thought was wrong with him then points to 3 areas on his body and says \u201cit\u2019s cancer. But I am not going to die. I\u2019ll be up and running again by summer. If you have anymore questions you can talk to your mother\u201d. Gets up. Walks into his bedroom and closes the door. I looked at my mother like \u201cwtf?\u201d And we left. \n\nWe spent months lying to my daughter at his request. When he asked us to come over so he could tell her I felt like it was a relief that the deception could stop. It felt like it was not my secret to tell but after today\u2019s encounter I think she needs the truth. A trusted adult straight-faced lied to her about something very impactful and important and I think she is going to be very resentful of that fact when she gets older. To be clear he does not believe this lie himself- he is well aware he only has months left to live. I know he told this to her thinking it would benefit her somehow but I think it will hurt her. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I told my daughter that her grandfather is going to die?", "created_utc": 1677966633, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ied9r/wibta_if_i_told_my_daughter_the_truth_about_her/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way he spoke to your daughter wasn\u2019t okay, but I wonder if it\u2019s because he hates being the first real experience with death she\u2019ll have to go through. And him abruptly excusing himself might be to hide some pain. Which sucks for him, but is ultimately making it harder on everyone around him. Him trying to be \u201cstrong\u201d isn\u2019t actually helpful and makes the whole situation harder to navigate.\n\nShe deserves to know the truth. Being lied to and unprepared for something like this will only hurt her and as you said, probably make her resentful. Explain the situation to her gently and let her process. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s robbed her of that for these past months.", "NTA.  Tell her that he may have lied to spare her feelings.  But tell her.  If she's old enough to ask, she's old enough to know.  What's more, if he dies with thar lie still hanging in the air, she'll have trouble trusting you and your mother ever again.  Tell her.", "YWNBTA. I would not be comfortable being coopted into lying to your child, which is what this feels like. He's put you in a tough position, but I think your obligation to your child comes first. She is picking up on what is going on, and he is telling her to distrust her perceptions.", "NTA. \n\nYour your child\u2019s mother. No one gets to tell you to lie to your kids.", "NTA. Her grandfather wil die, and she will find out about it. Please protect your daughter and give her an opportunity to be mentally prepared. If you don't tell her she will have to deal with shock *and* betrayal and *grief* simultaneously, and spend her whole life regretting that she didn't get the opportunity to make the most of this time and say goodbye. \n\nIt sucks that your father doesn't get to share the news on his terms, but you have a responsibility to your daughter's emotional well-being at this point.", "NTA,\n\nI definitely think you should tell them. Normally I am for honoring the wishes of someone dying. But not in this instance. You are right that a trusted adult lied to your daughter and that can have negative consequences in the future. \n\nAnecdotally, my MIL hid her terminal diagnosis for as long as possible from my wife. And it was especially devastating for her when she heard the news. Basically, everyone knew but her. Lying just doesn\u2019t help, it doesn\u2019t protect anyone\u2019s feelings. \n\nYour daughter just loves her grandpa and doesn\u2019t want to see him go. I\u2019m sorry OP, you were put in a tricky position.", "NTA. She deserves to know. It will certainly make things a little less intense when he does pass, as she will have had time to process it. As for him lying, you can just tell her that the cancer has affected his personality and he really wishes that could be true.", "NTA - tell her to keep the ruse up though. She\u2019ll resent the fact that everyone was lying to her otherwise. She\u2019s 10, not 5\u2026..", "NTA. Be honest with her, especially if he doesn\u2019t have much time left. Because you\u2019re right- it will be harder on her if everyone is displaying this facade that he will get better. Yes it is a hard conversation to have, but put yourself in your daughter\u2019s shoes. Her grandfather\u2019s condition should be no secret.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is old enough to understand something is very wrong.  Not getting answers to her questions, or having words for her fears, is very much hurting her.\n\nShe needs you tell her the truth.  She needs answers to her questions.  And she needs an explanation for why everyone has been lying to her, and why her grandfather prefers her not to know. \n\nYes, the truth will hurt.  Painful truths do bring sadness and pain.  But lies don't prevent the hurt.  They compound it, once the truth becomes known.\n\nYou may want to check with your local hospital to find out if there are support groups for children dealing with terminal illness in a loved one, or the recent death of a loved one. \n\nThis isn't just about what the grandfather wants.  It is also about the trust and reliance that your daughter has for you, as a parent.  If she's blindsided because you've lied to her, she'll never know when she can trust you, and that will affect your relationship forever.", "NTA. your stepfather has stepped up and delivered for his grandkids, and he deserves to be able to die how he wants to die, but your daughter also deserves not to be surprised by what might be the biggest event to happen in her young life so far. if your kid is perceptive enough to have figured this out on her own, there\u2019s no idea what neuroses that brilliant little ball of neurons will generate if her grandpa just **poofs** out of her life.\n\nthis is just hard all around, OP, and my heart goes out to you all.", "NTA. Tell her in your own way. He said he has cancer. So she knows the worst of it. You can tell her that no one knows how long they have and so let\u2019s make most of the time we get with him. Don\u2019t lie but also don\u2019t dwell on it. But it\u2019s important that she can trust you to tell her the truth about important things.", "I'm going to say NAH.\n\nY W N B T A for being honest with her to some degree. When the inevitable happens and she finds out everyone knew but her, that's going to feel like a betrayal in multiple different ways. \n\nWith that said, I don't think many would blame a grandfather for wanting to shield his grandchildren, for wanting their biggest memories to be his life and relationship with them and not a year of knowing he's dying and looking at him like he's a time bomb. \n\nEveryone will learn at some point that loved ones aren't with us forever, and it's important that you have those conversations with her. You don't have to coldly inform her that grandpa lied and that he won't make it to her 12th birthday, but she's clearly an observant kid and knows something is amiss. Let her know that grandpa is trying to be optimistic with her but that things are more serious than he would like to admit. That he's trying to be brave and optimistic, whatever happens, and it will help him the most if others are as well.", "NTA. Feel free to blame his struggle with talking about feelings.  He didn't have the vocabulary or the emotional resources to deal with her feelings. \n\nIt is 100% time to tell her.", "This is above Reddit's pay grade. I think you might consider bringing in a family therapist on this one.", "NTA. Kids needs to know. They are not stupid and the best way how to go about it is being completely honest and direct. Use easy clear language and don't be afraid to be emotional in front of them during the talk.\n\nRecently I had a bit of similar experience with my kids, it wasn't human family member but our old dog. She developed cancer and despite all effort she needed to be euthanised two months after we found out. It happened past Thursday. We have 2 kids, age 7 and 4 and as hard it got I was completely transparent about what is happening, and our older, on his own request, was with us when vet put her down, our younger decided to play in other room. They are sad and are missing their beloved pet, she was permanent presence in their life since they were born. And yet we didn't see any unheatly grieving. And I was afraid how they woud take that, because they both are neurodivergent and unfortunately needing to mask when they outside of home takes tool on their mental health already. I'm not saying that loosing grandpa is anywhere near to loosing a dog. What I want to say, being honest and truthfully answer any question kids can have is necessary to proces grieving, especially if the kid already picked up on their own on the situation on hand.", "NTA. Tell her. As another commenter pointed out, if she's old enough to ask she's old enough to know. If he finds out and gets angry I'd say: At this point I think your relationship with your daughter is more important than your relationship with him. Even if she understands why you lied about it there will always be that little question mark if you're honest when it comes to important stuff.", "NTA, he deferred to someone else to talk about his condition so that can include you. You can explain to her that people are scared of dying and we don't like sometimes trying to face our fears, so that's probably why Grandpa is upset and angry. And even though your relationship with him is ambivalent  your daughter looks up to him, so remind her that he loves her.", "NTA.  You're the parent and you should get to decide when and how you share this information with your daughter.  Your stepfather's wishes only go so far, especially when it's having a negative effect on your daughter.", "NTA. I don't lie to my kids. I would tell her that Grandpa is being very brave but is sicker than he'll admit and while we hope he will recover, we have to accept that he might not.", "NTA.   You know what's bests for your child.  Tell her the truth.", "Mmmm... I'm thinking NTA...\n\nBut you might want to consult a better source on what best to say than AITA on this one... have to be better subreddits, or non reddit info for best way to go about this...\n\nWhether or not you are an AH should be the least of your concerns...", "NAH - i dont think anyone is being malicious in not telling her, and they probably think its for the best. But i agree with you, the daughter needs to know and it will be much worse if she only finds out he was sick after he passes.", "First of all, I\u2019m sorry you and your family are going through this, it\u2019s never an easy experience.\n\nI want to say N/t/a because in my opinion children should know this, have conversations about it, help them through it and cope. That prep time to understand and appreciate what\u2019s happening.\n\nHowever\u2026 \n\nIt is a request that you don\u2019t do that, because the grandfather wants to be remembered for life, not death and doesn\u2019t want to lay that burden on anyone. It\u2019s honestly a really tough situation and I hope in anything you and your family come out of it aright. I personally would take the request and mentally prepare and ready myself to have that conversation when he eventually does pass away, which in itself will be a heavy task be it you do it now or later. \n\nBest of luck. \n\nNAH.", "I was 8 when my paternal grandfather had cancer.  \n\nI was kept mostly in the dark, about what was going on.\n\nWe visited him once in the hospital and I was really glad to see he was doing good.  A few months later I was told he wasn't in the hospital anymore and was in hospice.  I was really glad since he was out of the hospital so figured he must be doing better.\n\nWe visited him in the hospice and that's when I learned what hospice care was.  It was shatteringly hard on me as I was expecting a big hug and to talk to him.\n\nThat didn't happen, he couldn't talk or open his eyes anymore.  He could still hear and hold hands.  \n\nMoral of the story don't leave kids in the dark or you might shatter them really hard.\n\nYears later found out my mom assumed my dad told me.  And my dad assumed since I was 8 I wouldn't understand so he didn't try.  \n\nBeen 29 years.  Since then still mad at dad for that one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She can use his remaining time to make memories, ask him any questions she might want to ask, etc. Shortly before my grandfather passed away, my grandmother and and my parents were told that if they wanted to say goodbye, they should do so that day. I was incredibly close to my grandfather and was in high school at the time. No one told me and no one asked me if I wanted to say goodbye. Thirty years later, I still resent my parents for that. I also resent them for how I found out he had passed--my mother was on the phone to someone at my sister's college, trying to arrange a ride for her to an airport when I walked in after school. I overheard her explaining to them that our grandfather had died and my sister needed to come home for the funeral.", "NTA. The kid already picked up on what's going on. Time to tell the truth. Your child is more adult than given credit for. Then she can make the most memories of the time left.", "Absolutely tell her the truth.

I have lost so many family members to cancer. I remember when my grandpa was dying I was 7 and he couldn't actually get the words out when he was trying to tell me and my siblings. When my Nan passed I was 16 and living with her and she hid it from me until she had to go to the hospital because she was so sick and in pain. The Dr told us she had stage 4 lung and bone cancer and she passed 3 days later. My Nanny had a heart issue but we all knew that her time was coming and I will never forget as soon as she passed my Poppy cried and said he's ready to die to be back with his love. That was in 2011 and my Poppy passed in 2020 at the age of 94 and his cancer was very slow. I will guess as soon as he locked himself in the bathroom he probably broke down", "Nta.

He explicitly gave you permission to do it so he wouldn\u2019t have to.  \nPersonally, I have a harder time maintaining control over my emotions when speaking face to face with people than any other time, and breaking news like that would be awful.  It sounds to me like he was asking you to tell her.", "Thank you for this! I have always been very transparent with my children and encourage honesty and openness because these were not features of my childhood.

I liked that they mentioned allowing your child to make the choice to see the dead or not. I'm a huge advocate for involving loved ones in the funeral process as much as possible and allowing them to spend time with the dead. It can help a lot with coming to terms with it and being able to feel like they fully got to say goodbye.\n\n You can talk to him and discuss the potential of him spending one on one time with each of the kids. Doing a sentimental or meaningful activity with them or creating something with them is a good idea so they have a physical object they can go to when they want to feel close to him. Build a bear or something similar is a good option, because then they can hug the toy and can sleep with it. They have pokemon toys at BaB now too, in case your son is going through his \"I'm too old for that!\" phase, but if there's any activity they used to do together, suggest trying to find time for it if possible", "NAH. I can see why maybe it was hard for him to say it to her face when the time came to do it. Personally I have never had a fatal disease, or had to cope with my own imminent death, or tell a child I was going to die. So I can\u2019t possible judge him an AH even though he blindsided you and put the ball back in your court.", "NTA. Tell her and discuss death in a manner that she might understand. Death and dying are difficult for many. Your daughter needs to know that whatever she feels inside, you are there for her.", "His lies will do far more harm than good. He's undermining her ability to trust what she's told, and  even her own observations.\n\nWhat about when someone else in the family gets sick with something treatable - how will she ever believe they'll be ok when her grandfather said the same thing and then died?\n\nTruth is so important in building healthy, trusting relationships with kids. It's awful that your mum's husband is dying, but your first responsibility is to support your kids through this."]}
