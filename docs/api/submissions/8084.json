The teacher work day starts 45 minutes before students arrive. I\u2019m a single mom and my principal knows I have no one else to bring my kid to school, so they have no issue with my kid sitting in my classroom during this time until their school day starts. My kid usually hangs out at my desk, watches a show on YouTube, eats breakfast, and plays with some toys I have set aside for them. They also usually bring a small toy from home to play with. \n\nOne of the school aides has a similar situation to me and her kid also goes to our school. The kid is a grade above my kid. Last year, her kid would sit in the aide\u2019s office, which is two doors down from my classroom, with her and play on their tablet. They\u2019ve become friendly with my kid, which is fine, except now the kid invites himself into my classroom almost every morning. \n\nIf they just sat quietly so I could work that would be fine. But I feel like I constantly have to monitor their interactions with my kid. They tell my kid about inappropriate things they see on the internet (I don\u2019t go overboard with censorship, but the whole \u2018Momo\u2019 creepy pasta thing isn\u2019t something I want my kid to know about). They snatch my kid\u2019s toy from them. They\u2019ve taken things out of my desk and moved things around, which my own kid knows not to do. I\u2019ve reminded the other kid of my rules and nothing changes. \n\nI just don\u2019t have time in the morning to be watching someone else\u2019s kid. My classroom is used after school by a student club so there\u2019s always a certain amount of clean up and repair to be done in the morning. I have to set up for the day. And I have a rough class this year, so tbh I really need a little bit of peace in my room before they come in. I\u2019ve established routines with my own kid so that I can still use this time to work productively and the other kid just throws it all off. \n\nI\u2019m generally not confrontational, but I feel like I need to tell the other mom her kid can\u2019t come into my room in the morning. I just feel like a jerk banning a child from my classroom.

You're not another mom's babysitter, and your reasoning makes perfect sense. You have your own stuff to do, and it's your classroom, so this is honestly a pretty simple case.\n\nSo yeah, you can ask her if she can keep her own kid in her own classroom. She most likely doesn't realize her kid is a burden to you, so there should be no issue if you just bring it up kindly. Alternatively, if your kid enjoys the other kid's presence, maybe ask the other mom to alternate or something? One day both kids will be with you, the next day they'll be with her.
