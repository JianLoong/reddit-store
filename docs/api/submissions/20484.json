I don't know what to do.\n\nMy wife Jane loves coffee. She used to work as a barista before getting a corporate job but she carried it forward and regularly makes us coffees with fancy patterns. She has a really fancy espresso machine with a grinder and they're her pride and joy. We often joke that it's the third wheel in our marriage given how much she's interested in the drink.\n\nI thought for an early birthday present, it would be nice to get her a new one. I saw this seller who can refit espresso machines and customise them so I thought it would be nice to get one that has olive and sage green accents. I'm quite proud of myself for thinking of it and it would look a lot nicer in our kitchen. Hers right now is stainless steel and reflective which stands out like an eyesore. So I got in touch with the seller and he agreed and he also helped me refit 2 portafilter handles with olive wood. One of them has her initials carved into it and the other says \"Happy Birthday Darling\" with a heart. I was going to give her this today and then show her the machine. I also got her a new grinder and had that match the espresso machine. Thoughtful right?\n\nWell there was an issue with delivery so her new machine got delayed. My buddy came by late last night to pick up her machine and grinder which I let him have because of the new one, and then in the morning she would have come down to see the new machine. Now there is no machine. She flipped out asking me what i'd done with it because it was pretty obvious it was missing so I said I'd given it away to my friend because he needed it.\n\nI didn't want to ruin the surprise. She asked me why I didn't think to tell her and I didn\u2019t know what to answer so I just said that his broke and he needed one. We went back and forth for a bit and then she said she was going to go to a cafe and left. She came back and then I forfeited what my plan was and she was thankful but still annoyed I'd given her machine away without at least asking her because it has sentimental value to her (her brother bought her the machine as a gift for landing her corporate job).\n\nMy view is that it would have ruined the surprise if I'd told her and the shipping only showed it was delayed this morning. I did message my buddy to see if we could get it back for now until the new one comes but he said his parents are using it and I don't want to inconvenience them over a misunderstanding.\n\nAITA?\n\nJesus did not think this would be so huge. I am wrong, gonna message my buddy and offer to pay to help his parents buy a machine and grinder for the inconvenience", "created_utc": 1687637127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i283c/aita_for_giving_away_my_wifes_espresso_machine/", "score": 4145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially to give it away before the arrival of the new one? \n\nYeah, YT enormous A.", ">it has sentimental value to her (her brother bought her the machine as a gift for landing her corporate job)\n\nYTA.  Why would you give away a gift to her that had sentimental value?

If she does, then get it back.", "YTA\n\n> My buddy came by late last night to pick up her machine and grinder which I let him have because of the new one\n\nWhat the actual fuck?!?\n\nOK, for one, coffee people **_know their shit_** and even if everything else here went smoothly, REPLACING your wife's machine was a HUGE risk. Because chances are, she had things working *exactly* the way she wanted them.\n\n> Hers right now is stainless steel and reflective which stands out like an eyesore.\n\n... it's a kitchen appliance. For products of appreciable quality, stainless steel is pretty much the default. This complaint makes me concerned that you don't quite know what you're up to here.\n\n> he said his parents are using it and I don't want to inconvenience them over a misunderstanding.\n\nOh, but inconveniencing \n\n#YOUR WIFE\n\nis find and dandy?", "YTA. You NEVER get rid of something without asking them first!!!", "You gave away something she loved because you wanted something that matched the kitchen.  Did you really expect her to be happy about that?

The gift is not for her. She's happy with her machine, and it has sentimental value. You gave it away for your selfish reasons; it's too shiny. It's not a misunderstanding. It's selfishness. Get her machine back.", "YTA espresso machines are very personal to true coffee addicts (like me). Your wife was probably excited to make her coffee first thing in the morning and found that there was none and no way to make it. If it were me I\u2019d be livid. I cannot start my day without having some coffee first. \n\nAnd just because you got her a different, custom machine doesn\u2019t mean she would like it. A good espresso maker is like a musical instrument and different people like different things. You should have given her the new machine and let her decide which one she wanted to keep. \n\nYou might have been surprised to find that she wanted to keep the old one. If you had a Mercedes and she got you a Lexus and she gave away your Mercedes before giving you the Lexus you\u2019d be annoyed. And then you\u2019d be pissed if you liked the Mercedes better than the Lexus but got stuck with it because she gave your favorite car away.", "YTA.

Why would you even let him take it? \n\n>I didn't want to ruin the surprise.\n\nSurely the only way to achieve this was to leave the old one where it was until she unwrapped her gift?\n\nSounds like your thinking more about yourself and your friend than your wife.", "***YTA*** no question.\n\n>She has a really fancy espresso machine with a grinder and they're her pride and joy.

I don\u2019t understand the part where it then becomes your decision what she does with the old machine? Even if the new machine was not delayed and your plan had worked out you would have been the AH.\n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t sound like she was clamoring for a new machine and this purchase seems at least as motivated by your desire to achieve a certain aesthetic in your kitchen as to give her something nice.", "Let\u2019s put it this way.

But.. What if she wanted to give it to her parents or brother? \n\nThis is bad planning. What if the machine is crap or doesn't work? What is she doesn't like the way it works? What if the features are not what she wanted? Maybe she wanted an upgraded model?\n\nYour friend is also TA. He could easily explained the sentimental nature of the machine to his parents. You could have gone to pick it up yourself. If I was you, I would insist on getting it back.\n\nI repeat...IT WAS NOT YOURS TO GIVE AWAY OR DECIDE WHO GETS IT!!!", "YTA you don\u2019t give away something that\u2019s not yours. The fact she had a new one in the mail is moot. It was hers. And it was hers to give away to whomever she choose, or not. That\u2019s not a misunderstand, you\u2019re just an AH.", "YTA this is ridiculous not only did you give something that didn\u2019t belong to you away but you did it before you even had the replacement? That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. Who cares if it inconveniences his parents it\u2019s not there\u2019s to begin with and it certainly wasn\u2019t your place to give something that was gifted to her away to them. You are completely in the wrong on every aspect you should go get what you gave away back. And if they need one so badly they can buy one", "YTA That machine never should have left the house without your wife's permission.", "The gift itself is thoughtful, but YTA still for giving away someone else\u2019s stuff. The fact that the new was was delayed doesn\u2019t actually matter. Even if the replacements had been there, giving away something that was a gift to your wife from her brother is a shitty move.", "WOW YTA AND GET HERS BACK IMMEDIATELY", "YTA dude.....if my husband gave away my stuff he will be sleeping alone for a decade. Her machine was of sentimental value. You had no right to give it away without her permission. Get it back right now and apologize to her. Why you men have emotional range of a ball pen when it comes to women!", "YTA. BIG TIME.\n\nYou got yourself the gift of something you liked the look of better than what your wife uses and there is no issue with, and are trying to pass it off as  a gift for her.  And it sounds like you're getting her a used one too? Or at the very least one that has been tampered with so it could be potentially worthless if it doesn't work properly, you can't even get it replaced. You mad no mention of making sure the specifications even matched the one she prefers.  And now, because of the potentially shady replacement is delayed, and you didn't even have the courtesy to wait until the new one arrived before stealing her old one and giving it away, she has no machine. And you expect her to be grateful. WTF\n\nOh I missed the first time that the old machine was sentimental to her, and a gift from her brother.  You are definitely the asshole times 1000 for that. \n\nIt's not thoughtful at all to  get a gift  to your specifications to replace someone's sentimental items. FFS Get your wife's machine back from your friend. Immediately", "YTA, it sounds like a lovely gift but you don\u2019t give away someone else\u2019s stuff. Also you shouldn\u2019t have said oh just because his one broke. Giving it away wants your decision. The way you handled this sucks.", "YTA - lovely gift idea, but the old one was not yours to give away. You should have asked her what she wanted to do with them.", "Yta, even if you bought her a new one, the old one does not belong to you and you had no right to give it away. I would be furious. Really jerk move.", "YTA. People who are that serious about coffee know what machinery they want. My husband is  a huge coffee lover and has several different appliances that he uses regularly. I totally support his passion, but I'm not really into coffee. I don't feel knowledgable enough to try and surprise him with a new machine. And why would I? Part of the fun for him is doing the research, choosing what he wants, and excitedly anticipating its arrival. I have a feeling that your wife feels similarly. Crossing fingers she likes the machine and grinder you chose for her, but you really should have asked her what she wanted. \n\nAnd you should never have given away the machine and grinder she loves without telling her! She has every right to be pissed at you.", "YTA. Yes, it's a very thoughtful gift, but still doesn't give you the right to just get rid of *her* old machine.", "YTA\n\nWhether you bought her a new one or not is beside the point. You gave away something that is very valuable to her and that\u2019s pretty a-hole behaviour.", "YTA. This is so disrespectful to your spouse. It was her machine, and you gave it away before the other arrived. How could you let the friend take it under those circumstances? Truly a stupid move.", "YTA for giving away your wife's possessions.  \n\nIf someone gave away something a family member got me to celebrate an achievement I would be furious.  \n\nAs for your picky attitude toward the colour of it, you sound difficult.\n\nYou did not give it away by accident.", "Definitely YTA. That machine could be old and simply be emotionally or otherwise valuable for whatever reason. Why would you give away something that's not yours?", "YTA\n\nYou may have good intention to gift your wife a new espresso machine but you cannot give someone else's stuff without asking them. Stuffs do have sentimental values and it should have been your wife's decision about whatever she wants to do with her old machine.", "YTA. Even though you got your wife a new machine the old one wasn't yours to give away. She might have wanted to keep it or give it to someone of her choosing. I would be very upset if you did this to me and I would demand you get it back. Especially because of the sentimental value attached to it.", "YTA and need to get that machine back for your wife. Although the gift was thoughtful, the execution was careless and thoughtless. It was HER machine, you had no right to decide she didn\u2019t need it anymore", "YTA, the idea is sweet but replacing something precious shouldn't be done as a surprise for exactly the reasons your story highlights:\n\n1) Sentimental value you're not aware of-- it was a gift and it sounds like she didn't want to replace it\n\n2) In order to keep up the surprise you have to actually hurt the other person and destroy their trust-- when she saw you got rid of it and gave it away you chose to lie about why and you hurt her so badly she left to process her feelings without you. You actually caused her pain and have probably permanently damaged her trust in you over what was meant to be a sweet gesture\n\n3) Timing-- now if she wants the old one she just straight up can't have it because of how long it took you to tell her what's going on\n\nI'm going to add in the fact you don't want to inconvenience your friend's parents but don't mind inconveniencing your wife isn't generalizable like the other points but is pretty messed up. Please rethink your priorities here and put your wife's feelings first", "YTA for arranging a buyer for someone else's property. If your wife sold your truck to the mailman with the excuse of \"I got a new one on pre-order!\", you'd be pissed. What to do with your truck is your business. What if she wanted to give it to a friend of hers?", "YTA- Not for getting her a machine and grinder she wanted but for giving away her current machine and grinder. It seems like you focused a lot on how well you thought you did on this gift and the surprise aspect. And not so much actually making your wife happy. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. But to just let her think you gave just up and away her stuff instead of fessing up right then is extra asshole. Your friend sucks too. It wasn\u2019t your stuff to give and he should give it back immediately.", "YTA maybe she would have wanted to give hers to her brother or maybe she won\u2019t even like the new one.", "YTA. While the gift is super thoughtful and sweet she has every right to be annoyed that you gave away her property. You shouldn't have done that at all. She should have been given the choice on what to do with the old machine and grinder. So now your really great gift is tainted by this because you hurt her in the process.", "YTA. It\u2019s not yours! If you gift her a new one, that means she now has two machines and should do with the old one as she pleases! Who cares about your buddy and his parents?!", "YTA why did you think it was a good idea to give her coffee machine without talking to about it first. I think you would be super pissed if she did that to you", "YTA. You need to get that old machine and grinder back dude. It wasnt yours to give away. Your buddy agrees with you because he landed a swanky espresso machine from the deal.", "Yta it doesn't matter even if there was a new one! It wasn't your to get rid of!  Maybe she'd want to take it to work to use. Or keep it as a back up!", "YTA, I see you\u2019re basically arguing with everyone who says you\u2019re TA.\n\nNo matter if she loves this one you\u2019ve got, get her original back from your friend.\n\nIT WAS NOT YOURS TO GIVEAWAY.\nIf your wife decides to get rid of it, fine, it\u2019s her decision.\n\nDo you have nothing sentimental or do you not grasp what you\u2019ve done.", "You stole her belongings and gave them away.

That\u2019s what it means when you take things that aren\u2019t yours, and her coffee machine was not yours. Now you are refusing to get it back cause not inconveniencing your friend\u2019s parents is more important than your wife\u2019s feelings. You ask if you are an ah? You are a major ah. If something isn\u2019t yours than you don\u2019t give it away, even if you buy a replacement as a gift.

Did you even know the sentimental value or forgot about it? either way you don't give away something that doesn't belong to you.", "YTA because you stole something from your wife and gave it away. That shows how little you respect your wife.", "What were thinking? Why do you think you are well equipped to decide what elements of the machines are what your wife values? Your level of knowledge of your wife\u2019s passion is that the coffee is \u2018fancy\u2019. A grinder and a machine is more than whether it matches a kitchen.\n\nHow do you know your wife would prefer it?\n\nRegardless of whether you should have given her possessions away at all (you should not), you certainly shouldn\u2019t have done it before the replacement was ready.\n\nYTA", "YTA- Don\u2019t ever get rid of anyone else\u2019s items even if you are gifting them a better model.", "YTA.

Definitely an AH.", "YTA, you don't give someone's stuff away without asking.\n\nYour plan had good intentions and terrible execution, even if the shipping mayhap didn't occur this would be a horrible plan.\n\nWhat you were supposed to do was keep the old machine, when the new machine arrived, put away the old machine, not give it away. Your wife would be happy for the gift, you THEN discuss with her what should you do with the old one.  \n\nYou still get to surprise her and she still gets to choose what to do with her stuff, then it would come out that it's sentimental and you could store it or she would have chosen to give it to a friend, or maybe bring it to her office.

Present really for your own benefit. \n\nGo and get her machine back. A much less sophisticated one will likely  do for the parents rather than your wife's prized, sentimental possession.

I don't know what to do.\n\nMy wife Jane loves coffee. She used to work as a barista before getting a corporate job but she carried it forward and regularly makes us coffees with fancy patterns. She has a really fancy espresso machine with a grinder and they're her pride and joy. We often joke that it's the third wheel in our marriage given how much she's interested in the drink.\n\nI thought for an early birthday present, it would be nice to get her a new one. I saw this seller who can refit espresso machines and customise them so I thought it would be nice to get one that has olive and sage green accents. I'm quite proud of myself for thinking of it and it would look a lot nicer in our kitchen. Hers right now is stainless steel and reflective which stands out like an eyesore. So I got in touch with the seller and he agreed and he also helped me refit 2 portafilter handles with olive wood. One of them has her initials carved into it and the other says \"Happy Birthday Darling\" with a heart. I was going to give her this today and then show her the machine. I also got her a new grinder and had that match the espresso machine. Thoughtful right?\n\nWell there was an issue with delivery so her new machine got delayed. My buddy came by late last night to pick up her machine and grinder which I let him have because of the new one, and then in the morning she would have come down to see the new machine. Now there is no machine. She flipped out asking me what i'd done with it because it was pretty obvious it was missing so I said I'd given it away to my friend because he needed it. \n\nI didn't want to ruin the surprise. She asked me why I didn't think to tell her and I didn\u2019t know what to answer so I just said that his broke and he needed one. We went back and forth for a bit and then she said she was going to go to a cafe and left. She came back and then I forfeited what my plan was and she was thankful but still annoyed I'd given her machine away without at least asking her because it has sentimental value to her (her brother bought her the machine as a gift for landing her corporate job). \n\nMy view is that it would have ruined the surprise if I'd told her and the shipping only showed it was delayed this morning. I did message my buddy to see if we could get it back for now until the new one comes but he said his parents are using it and I don't want to inconvenience them over a misunderstanding.\n\nAITA? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There was no need to give away the old one before the new one arrived and was in use. You seem to care more about your friend's  convenience than your wife's.\n\nOne more time get the old one back for now. I don't understand your friends opinion, there was no mistake you straight up gave something away that wasn't yours.", "YTA just because you bought her a new one doesn't mean her old one is now yours to give away.

It isn't yours to give away. It isn't your call to make. You knew it was important to her.\n\nYou're also an asshole because you didn't just tell her when she was clearly upset because you wanted to do a big reveal and relish in your masterful sueprise. It seems you had some idea how adored you'd be for this surprise, and you still wanted that. The surprise part of the gift was for you, not her.

You're a super idiot and not as considerate as you think you are since this is likely all about you not liking her stuff because it doesn't 'fit in'.", "Ok. \nYTA\nMASSIVELY", "HARD YTA. As a former barista, this is INSANE to me. There's a reason she liked her machine and grinder. Her grinder was likely dialed in to how she liked it perfectly. I don't know how manual her machine was, but I'm sure she also had it set up to her liking. \"Fancy coffee\" isn't just about latte art; it rarely is actually. It's about the taste that you get from achieving the best extraction (subjectively). \nI don't understand why you didn't think of presenting her with the new one while keeping the old one. I read one of your comments here about setting the new one up and surprising her with it that way. I don't know about your wife, but that would also piss me off because you probably inadvertently ruined all the presets in the machine and grinder. \nJust don't touch stuff that isn't yours, OP", "YTA would it have been that hard to tell your friend not today?\n\n Even than it's not yours to give away!! When the new one came, you could have set it up, put the other one elsewhere. Way to make something nice a clusterfuck", "YTA. How dare you replace something of your wife that has sentimental value. So controlling.", "Yta simply and only for giving away the machine it wasn't yours to give it was your wife's a gift that was given to her by someone she loves she could of chose a multitude of things to do with it then giving it to YOUR friend\nA. Could of sold it and profited\nB. Used it at her office\nC. gifted it to one of HER friends as a present \nD. Absolutely anything else store it Incase her other breaks down or something goes wrong \n\nIt was a nice gesture I understand you got her a nice machine it's custom and it is a great gift but a gift shouldn't also means forfeiting another item that you don't even get to choose what for. You should talk to your friend about getting the machine back tell him you messed up it wasn't yours to give away and you let your wife make the choice and then you don't ever mention this misunderstanding again as if to say \"he's upset at me but it's your machine so I got it back\" it's back handed  you say I'm sorry I didn't understand that you might have other plans for the machine so I got it back Incase you want to do anything with it.", "The old ones were hers to decide whether to give away or not.  Maybe she would've put it in her office?  Rude.  Yta", "Get your own Grindr. Problem solved.", "YTA. Damn", "Holy shit dude\n\nI understand the thought process and good on you for thinking ahead\n\nBut something that you know your wife is attached to... don't just give it away without discussing it. Sentimental value alone\n\nYTA\n\nCall up your buddy and let him know that you're gonna need that back and apologize to everyone", "YTA.\n\nThe new machine is cute and sounds pretty well thought out from comments.  The old machine was hers to give away if she wanted to, not yours. \n\nAs a general tip, if the person who you got the gift for is unhappy, whether or not you're \"an AH\", you messed up.  Being an AH doesn't mean you're an awful husband or person.  but if you're an AH to your wife, you should probably aim to make things better.  \n\nIf you don't go get the old one back, you'll have created a situation where every time she looks at that new machine, she's going to remember the feeling of you fucking up.  Getting the old one back may or may not fix that.  Your move.", "YTA, you should have just waited til it was there to give it away???", "YTA\n\nThe machine and grinder were hers,you had no right to give it away to YOUR buddy.", "So you prefer to inconvenience your wife than your \u201cbuddy parents\u201d?

I\u2019d have been bloody fuming if I\u2019d been her even after you told her about the new one. \n\nShe might have wanted to give it to her own friend, brother or anyone else. She may have wanted to keep a spare, hell, she might even hate yours when it finally arrives. \n\nYou had no right to give her property away. \n\nI\u2019ve seen some high handed shit, but yours takes the biscuit. \n\nYour friends parents are using it so she can\u2019t have it back! So you won\u2019t inconvenience his parents, but it\u2019s ok to inconvenience your wife!

Not before.  Maybe she knew someone who would love it that she'd prefer giving it to, you just don't give away someone else's gift, ever. \n\n That was her decision and only *after* she got the new one and it worked just as good as or better than the one you gave away.\n\nFunny how you can't inconvenience your buddy, but you can your wife.

This is intentionally giving away one of her favorite things all because you want a surprise.  Even if you had your surprise, the old one was still hers, it wasn't yours to give away.  \n\nAnd then you don't want to inconvenience your friend's parents.  Really?

You're an awful husband.", "YTA Maybe I'm weird or whatever, but I usually wait until I have the new item in my hands before I get rid of the old one. Also, if the old item isn't mine, I ask the owner of the item what they would like to do with it. I even give that same respect to my 8yr old daughter when she outgrows toys/ clothes. If she says sell them I give her the money from it.

It should be her who decides what happens to the old one, since it is her property.

Alternatively, if she still wanted the same basic machine, you could have given her a gift card to mail in her current machine and have it altered. \n\nAsk your friend for the machine back since she doesn\u2019t want to get rid of it. It wasn\u2019t yours to give away; tell your friend you made a mistake.", "YTA- this was a big purchase and that alone should have been run by her. There\u2019s also the fact that SHE KNOWS THIS MACHINE, how it works, it\u2019s quirks, it\u2019s tricks, and you took that from her and made her learn a new one. And you didn\u2019t even consider the sentimental value to it. One of the biggest reasons YTA, is that you can\u2019t just get rid of someone else\u2019s stuff, even if you are replacing it, it\u2019s not yours to give away.", "Further my why do you even need a new one. How is it better or was this just vecuaee you wanted a matching kitchen and didn't care about her birthday to begin with", "YTA. Just because you got her a new one doesn't mean the old one HAS to go! Why couldn't she have both? \n\nBottom line is, that it was never yours to give away. \n\nIf you thought she should get rid of the old one, you should have waited until AFTER you gave her the new one and discussed it with her instead of giving it away behind her back.", "YTA. You STOLE her espresso machine and now won\u2019t get it back. And you still think you\u2019re the good guy here? Really?\n\nGet her original machine back. Now.", "YTA and I would really be pissed and kick you out until my machine is back.\n\nWtf is wrong with you. You can't just give away other people things. Even if you gift her a new one, you can't just give away her machine.\n\nWtf.", "YTA.\n\nA coffee maker is something you do not replace without permission. While you may think the new one is ooh shiny, hers may have features you haven't even heard of.\n\nBesides, it wasn't yours to give. Technically, you stole it.", "So your wife owns an item which holds significant sentimental value based off a moment in her life. \n\nAnd you decide to get rid of it without asking, or caring about what she wants, and without any consideration for why it\u2019s important to her. \n\nBut you think it\u2019s ok, because she\u2019s not a big fan of the shine\u2026 seriously. If your wife had a car she loved that held sentimental value, but wasn\u2019t a massive fan of the colour, would you give that away as well?? Then \u2018surprise\u2019 her with something else\u2026\n\nThen then your wife rightly demands you get it back, you\u2019d rather not.

How can you possibly think you are not an asshole here", "YTA, not a well thought out plan...Next time ask questions before like that stainless stell coffee maker stands out...She would have then said but my brother got it for her and it had sentimental value...Crisis averted....", "YTA. It is her's, it was a gift. You giving her a gift doesn't grant you permission to get rid of her things. \nGiving a gift doesn't mean you get to take anything of hers away.", "You my sir are an absolute bloody asshat.\n\n\nYour wife deserves someone with more brain cells than you.", "Of course YTA. And of course your buddy is going to agree with your choice to give it away because he doesn\u2019t want to give it back. You\u2019re a fool if you think a new machine is going to sweep under the rug the sentimental item you gave away without her permission.", "I think a lot of this is a misunderstanding and not malicious, but YTA for not waiting until it arrived and making sure she even likes it in person before giving her tried and true one away??? Wtf?? That's just thoughtless, dude.", "YTA. You should wait to get rid of the old one until you give her the new one and your sure she likes it and wants it. What if she doesn\u2019t like the new one and wants her old one back? What are you going to do then?", "YTA. And you are 100% wrong with what you did and how you handled it. That was not your machine to give away. Get it back", "YTA. the old one wasn\u2019t yours to give away. It\u2019s not a thoughtful gift if you\u2019re taking something else away from her.

How is replacing something that works just fine even a gift? Even if she was fine with replacing it, you need to at least give her the option of selling the original. What gives you the right to just give away something so expensive of hers?", "YTA my wife knows the kitchen is my domain and she would NEVER replace one of my pieces of equipment without asking.  The fact you don't see why caring more about your buddy than your wife says a lot about you", "If it\u2019s sentimental, your friend needs to return it. It was NEVER yours to give \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t return it, I hope you wake up and find that your car is missing coz your wife has a friend who likes it\u2019ll lmao", "YTA. It doesn't sound thoughtful. It sounds like you just didn't like the look of the perfectly good machine she already had. So you basically got her nothing for her birthday. Also, her brother gave her that machine, which makes you double the asshole. Why not do some fucking research and find a nice gift she would actually need/want for coffee? THAT would have been thoughtful.", "YTA... many, many people hold their appliances sacred... especially chefs and officianados...\n\nYou shouldn't have given hers to your friend until the new one arrived.   And then you lied about...", "YTA  \nYou didn't get her a gift.  You came up with a plan to get rid of something she had that you hated, and replacing it \"as a gift\" was the only way to cover this up.  That's also the reason you had someone come and take the old one away before you got the new one, because you wanted to make sure she had no chance to get it back.  It doesn't matter if you got a new one, the old one is her possession, and you had NO right to get rid of it.  And you know that.  Because again, this is about you getting rid of something you hated, not treating your wife.\n\nOh, and when you went to get it back, you declined because you didn't want to inconvenience people you don't know, after YOU GAVE THEM HER SHIT WITHOUT HER PERMISSION. Fuck that.  You stole her shit.  Get it back, NOW. And eat every bit of blame yourself.", "Damn son.  Wth? YTA fa real man. Never throw anything of hers away.

The truth hurts.", "You don't touch other people's stuff, nice surprise or not. A good kitchen appliance is worth it's weight in gold.

Whether well intentioned or not, you took and gave away something that does not belong to you. yta", "YTA\n\nAre you kidding? Why would you give any your wife's applicance that was a gift from her brother?", "YTA. You knew that particular machine was sentimental to her. Getting her a new one was a great idea however giving away HER old one was not your business to do. Then on top of that your present ended up being late so you lied to your wife because you didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise.

Nice gesture, bad execution.", "When someone is really into something they know their stuff and put value into their equipment. with the passion your wife has for coffee your present was very thoughtful but just badly executed. With the benefit of hindsight I am sure you can agree that it would have been much better to not take out the old machine until the new one was ready to go for her to use whichever morning she first day it.\n\nAnother good thing to have done it just keep the old machine until she sees and loves the new one and then gotten her agreement on what to do with the old one. We all place sentimental value on items and I am sure you have thing you would be upset if she gave away even if she had the best intentions. \n\nNTA for intention but YTA for execution.", "I was all for the sweet gesture until you revealed her old machine was a gift with sentimental value. What were you thinking??

So....he got a new one to get rid the old one", "YTA for many reasons. Others have already pointed them out to you", "To me, it also sounds like he is trying to outdo her brother's gift? She probably loves it because it's from her brother and he's a bit jealous, maybe? Idk, just my thoughts.", "At the time when she got it, I assumed she'd bought it and her brother was helping her bring it to the house. I didn't know it was from him", "This, but I wanted to stress you should never ever take away someone\u2019s hobby/passion item to replace it. Chances are you will never know anything close to what they know about their hobby.\n\nI collect tea. My $30 kettle has settings for each tea type and it makes me happy. If someone sold it to replace it with a ceramic tea set I would be very unhappy.\n\nEdit:\nFor those asking Unfortunately I bought it three years ago and it appears to not be available for purchase :( If I had to buy a new one I would search reviews for things like \u201cthermometer\u201d \u201ctested\u201d etc to hear from someone who actually made sure the water doesn\u2019t run too hot.", "OP could have also WAITED until the new one came in set it up and gave her the option of wanting to keep the old one or give it away.

Definitely TA", "My husband is really into coffee, and I never realized before how freaking *detailed and specific* it gets. There's no way in hell I would replace any of his coffee making apparatuses, as there's no way I could pick out something better than him. Best case, I get the same quality and he still has to fine tune the settings and details back to his liking. More likely, I get something he doesn't like nearly as much as what he already had. That's not a gift, it's a chore or a shittier version of what he already had.\n\nAlso, never give something of someone else's away without explicit permission. It's literally that simple.\n\nSo yeah, OP, **obviously** YTA.", "Sounds like his buddy's an AH too because it's not even about righting a wrong at this point", "All of this and I also want to add that even if she loves the new machine, even if it arrived on time, you still had no right to give her other one away. SHE gets to decide what happens with her other machine. You didn\u2019t give her a gift, you asserted your control and told her she doesn\u2019t matter.  Get the machine back from your buddy and  very seriously apologize to your wife. YTA", "Exactly this! The machine she had may have been way better than the one you picked out. Why would you do this?", "Right? Ready to send this to r/espresso and let them have a go at him.", "He seems to care more about his buddy than his wife. Also, it was a gift from her brother, so it was a sentimental gift.\n\nWhat that thing, of yeah, communication \ud83d\ude44, that would have been wonderful. I know he wanted to surprise his wife, but with big purchases and the disposal of her gift from her family, it has to be a decision that she makes, not op. That was a fail for me.", "OP suffers from premature gratification", "And OF COURSE he gave it away to his mate", "Yup. Best move would\u2019ve been to buy her the gift and let her decide what to do with the extra. It\u2019s hers.", "In total fairness I hate the stainless steel aesthetic too.", "She has mentioned this one in passing and the grinder too, I didn't randomly google a new machine to purchase. I know coffee things are complex, I didn't want to get her something she'd never heard of before", "Exactly, you never know the sentimental value a person might have towards it.

She went overseas for a month and came back her husband - who had to stay home due to his job- had sold to old beat up run around and replaced it with a porsche 4wd. She loved her old car, could park it anywhere, didn't feel conspicuous and would have rathered her husband took the money and took time off work to join her on vacation. Caused so many arguments.", "Yes I know its a personal thing so I got one that she's talked about before and the grinder too. They're not unfamiliar to her but they've always been out of her budget", "With out their espresso permission in this case", "No they were for my wife, I don't make the coffee, she does happily", "Well I was going to set it up for her and then give her the portafilter and let her come down to see her new machine in place of the old one", "I feel like this right here is it. I understand and agree with the people focusing on the issue being that he gave away something that was hers... But this in particular... If he knew it meant so much to her it's risky enough to try and replace it. It is a whole separate level to get rid of her \"pride and joy\"  to one of his friends.

Otherwise you will be TA", "YTA. As others have mentioned, coffee isn't just throwing grounds in a canister and pressing a button. One espresso maker does not replace another equally. \n\nWith regard to coffee grinders, people can be very particular...I know I am. I have 2 coffee grinders for this reason because I have two different kinds of espresso makers. Each coffee grinder was meticulously calibrated through repeated trial and errors - it took me probably 20 espresso shots before I was happy with the grind. Too fine and the pressure is too much, the shot doesn't really pull. Too loose and it's weak sauce. I have not changed the grind in years. If my coffee grinder was replaced, I will be very upset.\n\nDon't give things away that aren't yours without permission from the owner. If you were a car enthusiast and you loved restoring vintage muscle cars, would you be upset if your wife gave away your prized muscle car (because they didn't like the aesthetic of all reasons) and got you a new tesla instead? \n\nWhat kind of espresso maker did she have before? Did you do a lot of research specifically about the make / model that she had? Same thing with the grinder. It sounds like you were more focused on the sellers service  regarding custom retrofitting as opposed to researching all there is to know about coffee, espresso, grinders, espresso makers, etc. Not all brands are equal! Even if it's the same brand, companies have been cheaping out in recent decades in order to cut costs, hoping they can coast successfully using brand recognition.

For a few reasons actually:\n\n1) While I don\u2019t drink coffee myself, even I know that coffee machines can\u2019t be 1 to 1 replacements of each other. If you\u2019ve gone so far to call a kitchen appliance the third wheel in your relationship, it\u2019s fair to say that your wife is a coffee nerd, meaning she is probably super particular about what kind of machine she had. There is a non-zero chance that the product you got for her could be inferior in her tastes, which considering that it\u2019s a drink machine is a big deal.\n\n2) Even if she likes the gift, she is still well within her rights to be pissed off at you. That was a gift in the first place for one, and two it was HER gift. Sure, it may be in your shared house, but it was hers. You had no right to give away her gift. If she gave away your machine that you got her, would you be mad? I sure hope that answer isn\u2019t yes or that would make you a blazing hypocrite.\n\n3) Surprises are meant to be fun. If your surprise causes annoyance and you still keep it hidden, it\u2019s a shit surprise 99% of the time. You should have fessed up as soon as you were confronted.\n\nYTA", "OMG. Why would you do that? You made so many assumptions! Clearly she didn\u2019t think it was an eyesore. It doesn\u2019t sound like an eyesore to me. YTA. You need to get her well loved stuff back and see if there\u2019s a chance in hell she\u2019ll forgive you.", "Eh, I'm a coffee fanatic, so I have to agree with your wife and Reddit on this one - you had really good intentions, but YTA. This is more of a TIFU than an AITA.\n\nTop comment said it all, really, but basically this: Your wife is an expert with professional experience. You may be a do-gooder, but your knowledge and expertise is probably a lot less than hers on the topic.\n\nNow, speaking to your wife, she acknowledges it's a sentimental gift - my understanding of this is, she never picked it herself. She may have all the settings tweaked *exactly* right, but maybe there is the *possibility* that you are actually able to get a better quality machine. That's, like, **all** you have going in your favour with this.\n\nIt's not particularly hard to grasp the issue. Imagine you were Gordon Ramsey's (the famous Scottish cursing chef) spouse. Imagine he has his fancy knife set - the perfect knives for his workflow - and, in a romantic gesture, you gave his knife set to your friend and then replaced them with engraved knives from an online professional kitchen knife seller that say \"I love you Gordon\" engraved on them. Romantic gesture? Sure. Good idea? Absolutely not - and the knives are probably worse quality than the carefully-selected originals.\n\nReplace the example with whatever you like. Tony Hawk's favourite skateboard. Bob Ross' paintbrushes. Your wife's coffee machine and grinder. These things, other than just having sentimental value, have *noticeably distinct* differences in quality, pertaining to the fact that they are chosen and used by *experts in their field*. Not to mention their use due to taste/preference, independent from quality.\n\nTIFU for not just giving away the old set, but also not consulting your wife (for her knowledge of the market and her preferences in the specifics) before buying the new one.

You said yourself they were her pride and joy!  Also - getting your wife a coffee maker is no better then a vacuum.

When you buy a gift you (should) do so because you want to do something nice for someone else. People tend to buy gifts they would like to receive. When you buy a gift for someone else that gift is not for you, and it's NOT to make YOU happy. It's all for the other person. So you have to be aware of your bias and go out of your way to find something you know the other person will like! \n\nSo getting her a gift you want is just wrong! I'm sure you can find a reason why she woud have liked it if it went right. But you could have gotten her something so much better. \n\nHow far you take the gift searching depends on your wants and your relationship with the person receiving. For example you would go all the way out for your wife but put a little less into a gift for your buddy. \n\nApologize, to your wife and stand your ground with your buddy.", "YTA. A couple times you praise yourself for being so thoughtful. Why are you getting her gifts? Is it to make her happy or to make yourself look good? \n\nYou wanna look good to your wife for getting a fancy personalized gift. You wanna look good to your buddy for giving him a free gift. You don't wanna look bad to your buddy's parents for asking for it back. Sometimes, the thoughtful thing means admitting you made a mistake. It's more thoughtful to make sure your wife is made whole and happy than to have the optics of being a good gift giving friend and husband. \n\nYou should have told your buddy you would ask your wife if she was willing to give it to him after she got the new one. It wasn't yours to give. You owe everybody an apology.", "Obviously YTA for all of this, but buying your buddy's parents a machine and grinder is not the answer either, that's just dumb.", "I am not sure anyone else has said this already, but - Growing up in a household where we were poor, you didn't 'get rid of' ANYTHING that wasn't busted.

A logical person would understand that you cant give away someone's property just because you are gifting them something similar.

I find it suspicious he didn't think to mention anything about quality except saying her current machine was 'fancy', he focused more on him thinking it was an eyesore and the colour of the new machine. It being a significant and very expensive upgrade seems like a major thing to have left out, especially managing to leave it out when the new machine apparently cost *that* much. It's also still a very expensive item to just give away..."]}
