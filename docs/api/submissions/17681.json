This trip was planned and booked before Ruby and I became serious. \n\nRuby asked if she can come as well, but as this trip is about my promise to Luna rather than a couple's vacation, and Luna and Ruby haven't spent a lot of time together yet so I said no but suggested that the three of us can go somewhere next year together.

This was a parent/child trip scheduled before you started dating, and what sounds like a pretty rare opportunity.  If she \"questions your commitment\" than maybe she isn't a good fit for a single parent, b/c that is an absurd statement. (Not all people are equipped to date single parents, but in general, the strange adult dating dad forcing themself on the child is not really a good look).

Is it the whole summer?\nI understand her being upset if you are going to be separated for a month or so, especially so soon into the relationships. I'd say she's justified in feeling deprioritized if  you're telling her you'd rather be alone with your daughter for the whole summer instead of including her to some degree. Even if it's shorter, this is still time you will be apart from each other, and that's going to be painful for her.  \nIf you don't want her to be there, then it is worth evaluation what that means for you and your relationship. Imagine how she must feel so soon into a relationship to have you disappear to another country without her. \n\nIf you are serious about this relationship, I strongly recommend making arrangements for ways to spend time together even if you're an ocean apart. Regular phone calls, watching TV shows together, things like that. Long distance requires maintenance, even if it's temporary. I also recommend talking to her about this more instead of reddit. If she is upset enough that she's talked to her sister, and what her sister heard from her has made her - a close friend of yours - call you an asshole, then it's worth considering how you can change things. \nAlso, part of being serious about a relationship is making compromises and arrangements. Yes, your daughter is priority #1, but your girlfriend must also be a priority for you. You cant simply proceed as scheduled without making adjustments with your new relationship in mind.\n\nEDIT: Also, I think everyone saying her being concerned is a big red flag are wrong. Really can't be said without more context, but I think she is likely just going to miss you because she cares about you and your relationship, and your not including her makes her feel unimportant to you. Someone leaving you for a significant time over the summer when you want to be with them is upsetting, and if compromise isn't made it's understandable to be hurt. Talk to your girlfriend, work something out, and don't listen to these people telling you to dump her because she feels like you aren't committed to her. Frankly I would also be a bit upset if I was told I shouldn't come even if I paid for it myself. You basically told her you don't want to spend time with her or see her for the entire duration of the vacation. This is almost more hurtful, imo, because you've only been together for 6 months. That means it's been so little time, and already you're disappearing for a while. If you were together longer, then you'd have a more stable ground to build on, but as far as she's experiencing things you are leaving during the early stages of the relationship and aren't interested in spending time with her. Do what you can to remedy that. Even if you aren't willing to bring her along for the vacation itself, make time for her. \n\nThis is all coming from someone with a partner who has left the country several times for family/school, it's important to have a plan for spending time together and maintaining the relationship.\n\nAlso important information to know; how long has she known?

I\u2019d be severely uncomfortable around their presence as they\u2019d still essentially be a stranger to me, and a tad hurt.\n\nShould state, NTA OP. I don\u2019t know how well your girlfriend realises how severely awkward it\u2019d be, not only in adding a +1 to all the bookings that would\u2019ve been made (as well as getting her a ticket, or tickets, to travel with you) but also going from spending a light amount of time (couple hours, shall we say) to spending every waking moment with your daughter, and vice versa for your daughter. I recognise your gf may see this as a bonding experience for her and your daughter, but really, 6 months is a tad early for that.", "Definitely NTA. My fianc\u00e9 (then boyfriend) weren't dating when I planned a trip with family/friends to the Bahamas. We started dating after the deposits had been put down and travel plans already made- even though we started dating in September and the trip wasn't until the following June. We were serious but not serious enough, and it would have been an inconvenience to everyone if we tried to shoehorn another adult into the space, along with trying to book flights etc. It was just too much, and he totally understood and did not expect to be invited. We just weren't there yet.", "Ruby is gonna try to become Stepmonster & send daughter to boarding school.  Getting Cruella DeVille vibes.", "This all day long. Ruby's entire reaction and lack of understanding should inform you about the viability of your relationship.", "Mine did not. Which is why we\u2019re getting divorced", "I can see the girlfriend trying to make the trip all about her and complaining the entire time. She should have seen it as a good thing that he bonds with his daughter. Except now, she feels she needs to compete.", "Her sister needs to mind her own business for sure. Our prior friendship doesn't give her the right to interfere.", "Any grown adult needs to throw that honeymoon phase shit away when dealing with a single parent. They don\u2019t have time for it.", "You have learned all you need to know about Ruby.\n\nAny woman who, after 6 months mind you, expects to be a priority over your daughter, and then calls her sister in as a reinforcement, is not stepmother material. Unless it\u2019s the Disney version. And you don\u2019t want to deal with that.\n\nThe red flags are flying. Cut and run before Luna gets hurt.\n\nNTA", "Nope it doesn\u2019t. I would drop her, it\u2019s only been 6 months?! She\u2019s already giving evil stepmother vibes. Probably expecting you to pay for vacation too. I definitely would side eye her sister and back off that friendship. Go enjoy your vacation with your daughter without the drama.", "Agree your daughter comes first and if your girlfriend of 6 months doesn\u2019t understand - time to say bye bye- NTA", "BOOM! You\u2019re a smart man.", "This is a very serious red flag that after 6 months she is trying to come between you and your daughters very special trip. A European vacation with just the 2 of you is a memory your daughter will cherish forever! PLEASE don't let this lady ruin that!", "Why are you with someone like this ? I\u2019m a mother and would never be this entitled. I\u2019d be touched that my partner is such a good dad and would want them to have a good time. Your child comes first \n\nI\u2019m worried you\u2019ll have a child with her one day and she\u2019ll treat your daughter like a second thought. This is a huge red flag", "And you're probably right, doesn't mean she came to that conclusion.", "She offered to pay for her part, but yes, I need to think hard about if I want to continue this relationship. Obviously my daughter comes first (and always will).", "Exactly - what's with the sister duo double teaming you???  This is a father/daughter trip - the girlfriend dujour is not needed.  Trying to guilt trip you into taking her and letting her horn in should give you pause.", "very comforting to hear that your daughter will always come first! You sound like a great dad", "Frankly the sister demanding you make your GF your first priority when you have a kid is enough to make me  say leave now. You have to remember that unless someone is NC with their family when you get serious about them you also get serious about their family. Her sister saying that is an indication of how they were both brought up. I had a friend in a similar situation. We\u2019re both 26 now and she hasn\u2019t seen her dad since the minute she turned 18.", "NTA I would 100% drop ruby in a heartbeat. You will never get me to choose anyone over my daughter, at all, ever. ALSO YOU'RE A BADASS DAD\n\nI'm reposting this as a direct reply to you because I feel like you need to see these types of comments. You are making the right decision by prioritizing your daughter.", "Yeah, you really need to think long and hard about this because, honestly, it's not a hard one to understand, and she is already trying to create problems between you and your child's relationship. It's not rocket science why you said no, nor is it a hard one to understand. Think long and hard. Remember that whoever you bring into your life is someone your daughter has to deal with, and she doesn't get a say, so make sure it's someone with a big heart who will be open and kind. Someone who will understand that your daughter will need alone time between her and her father sometimes, too. Don't let a significant other ruin your relationship with your child ever.", "I wouldn't think that hard about it. You have an awesome vacation coming up. Ruby will wait, or she won't.  You can care for her and still calmly stand by your choice to take this trip with your daughter. And if your girlfriend can't find a way to like you *more* for the forethought, and willingness, and sacrifice a trip like that costs, that is on her.  Wish her well as she walks away but don't waste too much time worrying about it.", "At six months the only couple's trip I'd be considering would be a weekend overnight somewhere.  Definitely a long European trip that's already been promised to a daughter.", "A reasonable adult would be able to understand that it's not about money. This trip is about you and your daughter spending time together as a family. \n\nShe's being immature. Her sister also needs to stay out of it.", "I say ditch her. That kind of ultimatum hints at other mental disease.", "This part right here: I wouldn't think that hard about it.\n\nDrop her like a hot potato and move on with your life, Super Dad.\n\nEdit: words out of order."]}
