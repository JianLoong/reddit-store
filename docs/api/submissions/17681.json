This trip was planned and booked before Ruby and I became serious. \n\nRuby asked if she can come as well, but as this trip is about my promise to Luna rather than a couple's vacation, and Luna and Ruby haven't spent a lot of time together yet so I said no but suggested that the three of us can go somewhere next year together. Ruby likes the idea but has questioned my commitment to the relationship if I'm not willing to compromise to include her or cut this trip short so that we can take another one together.\n\nRuby's sister whom I've known for many years and is a good friend texted me and called me an AH for excluding Ruby and not making her my number one priority.

This was a parent/child trip scheduled before you started dating, and what sounds like a pretty rare opportunity.  If she \"questions your commitment\" than maybe she isn't a good fit for a single parent, b/c that is an absurd statement. (Not all people are equipped to date single parents, but in general, the strange adult dating dad forcing themself on the child is not really a good look).  Also, while 6 months in \\*MAY\\* be a good time to schedule a vacation with a new-ish partner, it is generally not a good amount of time for a new-ish partner + your child to go on a BIG vacation like this.\n\nI'd maintain the \"no\" position, but if YOU and LUNA are comfortable with it, begin inviting Luna out with Ruby.
