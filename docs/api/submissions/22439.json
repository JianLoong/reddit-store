I'll try my best to keep things concise. \n\nOnce again, thank you for all your comments and support. They meant a lot to myself and my grandmother (who says hello).\n\nFirstly, my father managed to find my post despite my efforts. He told my mother about it, and she proceeded to blast me to the members of my extended family via social media, saying I made them look bad. She deleted the post a few hours later according to my cousins (who support me).\n\nA few days later, during a meeting between my parents and myself, my grandmother, and our lawyer, my father apologized to me, and I felt it was sincere. As for my mother, she was silently fuming. Matt was at their house with one of my aunts. They agreed (with great reluctance on my mother's end) to give my grandmother full custody of me for my remaining three years as a minor. The next day, my grandmother and some of my supportive family members helped me get what I had for belongings out of my parents' house. I didn't feel true relief until that moment. \n\nNow, I'm trying to enjoy my summer. I'm hanging out with friends. Going swimming. I'm relaxing. I'm finally reading books I bought three years ago that I never got a chance to read. I'm planning extracurriculars for next semester, and even planning a birthday party, my first in three years, for my sweet 16 in February. I'm also helping my grandmother around the house; I do chores, but this time, I'm getting an allowance. Even my sleep has improved. It's a whole new way of living, and it's kind of overwhelming, but I've never been happier.\n\nHopefully, this is the last time I post. I'm going to log off Reddit and go out with my grandmother for some shopping.\n\nThank you all.", "created_utc": 1689555795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151nbi8/update_aita_for_running_away_from_home/", "score": 156, "replies": ["I am so, so glad you're okay and doing well and enjoying your life like you should have been. I hope everything goes fantastic for you and your grandmother. \n\nOP's Granmother, you are a very generous and noble woman and I wish you and your granddaughter all the best.", "Enjoy being free my friend. We need more grannies like yours. \n\nGood luck in life.", "I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re living safely with your grandmother. You\u2019re grandmother truly advocated for you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not alone. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel bad for your little brother. \nI hope your parents actually stepped up and are not taking it out on him. Hopefully, this was a wake-up call for your parents.", "So glad you're in a better situation and can just enjoy being a teenager! Have a great rest of the summer!", "I love updates! Wonderful news. I admire you- so strong, finding your voice and forcing a change.  You will be a woman to be reckoned with, that's for sure. Enjoy your summer, and I know you will excel in school this coming year.\nWell done!", "Glad things worked out for you. One question: did you get your documents, such as birth certificate and social security card? You will need those, and I don\u2019t really trust your mother", "That's a good update. \n\nGo enjoy being a kid, keep up with your classes, and don't worry about anything but being a happy and healthy kid. \n\nI hope your dad learns a lesson here. It's blatantly obvious there is a problem, and it's not OP.", "So happy to hear this!\n\nSome things to remember though...\n\nNow is the time to go completely no contact with your parents and brother.  If you have your own phone, change the number.  Block their emails and social accounts.  Take control of your life and forget they exist.  It will be hard (hopefully not as hard since they were abusing you, use that anger and hatred of them to your advantage) but you will survive.  Best of luck!", "Enjoy your freedom! And if it hasn't been said before, I'm proud of you for sticking up for yourself!", "I am glad your extended family has helped you out.  I am glad your grandmother is raising you now.\n\nGood luck in school and your future."]}
