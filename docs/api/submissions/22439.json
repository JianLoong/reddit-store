I'll try my best to keep things concise. \n\nOnce again, thank you for all your comments and support. They meant a lot to myself and my grandmother (who says hello).\n\nFirstly, my father managed to find my post despite my efforts. He told my mother about it, and she proceeded to blast me to the members of my extended family via social media, saying I made them look bad. She deleted the post a few hours later according to my cousins (who support me).\n\nA few days later, during a meeting between my parents and myself, my grandmother, and our lawyer, my father apologized to me, and I felt it was sincere. As for my mother, she was silently fuming. Matt was at their house with one of my aunts. They agreed (with great reluctance on my mother's end) to give my grandmother full custody of me for my remaining three years as a minor. The next day, my grandmother and some of my supportive family members helped me get what I had for belongings out of my parents' house. I didn't feel true relief until that moment. \n\nNow, I'm trying to enjoy my summer. I'm hanging out with friends. Going swimming. I'm relaxing. I'm finally reading books I bought three years ago that I never got a chance to read. I'm planning extracurriculars for next semester, and even planning a birthday party, my first in three years, for my sweet 16 in February. I'm also helping my grandmother around the house; I do chores, but this time, I'm getting an allowance. Even my sleep has improved. It's a whole new way of living, and it's kind of overwhelming, but I've never been happier.\n\nHopefully, this is the last time I post. I'm going to log off Reddit and go out with my grandmother for some shopping.\n\nThank you all.", "created_utc": 1689555795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151nbi8/update_aita_for_running_away_from_home/", "score": 3774, "replies": ["I am so, so glad you're okay and doing well and enjoying your life like you should have been.

I was forced to give up so much, while I don\u2019t regret caring for them because they are innocent in all this. I wish I never experienced that. I was also experiencing SA and other types of abuse.

They have had a baby, they chose to put OP through this. Why would they feel such entitlement towards their daughters life. They were mean to be her guardians, her protectors, her biggest supporters. They have failed. As a dad, as a parent, as a person, I am saddened by their actions.

I am glad (and hopeful) that no child services got involved. \n\nBe a teen, hopefully you can at least meet with your parents some and be family, because whether you feel it or not it's important. The bond that exists between parent and child is beyond my understanding, but what happens to people separated from parents, especially as youth, is terrifying. \n\nDon't give up on them.

Their impeding your ability to sleep or have a life outside of caring for their child in your free time is unacceptable. I appreciate that we all have to pitch in, but this was excessive.  Do well in school, get your degree, when appropriate, get a part time job and start saving for college, if you cannot afford college, look into the military or countries \nLike Spain and Germany offer free university, so look into that.
