I'll try my best to keep things concise. \n\nOnce again, thank you for all your comments and support. They meant a lot to myself and my grandmother (who says hello).\n\nFirstly, my father managed to find my post despite my efforts. He told my mother about it, and she proceeded to blast me to the members of my extended family via social media, saying I made them look bad. She deleted the post a few hours later according to my cousins (who support me).\n\nA few days later, during a meeting between my parents and myself, my grandmother, and our lawyer, my father apologized to me, and I felt it was sincere. As for my mother, she was silently fuming. Matt was at their house with one of my aunts. They agreed (with great reluctance on my mother's end) to give my grandmother full custody of me for my remaining three years as a minor. The next day, my grandmother and some of my supportive family members helped me get what I had for belongings out of my parents' house. I didn't feel true relief until that moment. \n\nNow, I'm trying to enjoy my summer. I'm hanging out with friends. Going swimming. I'm relaxing. I'm finally reading books I bought three years ago that I never got a chance to read. I'm planning extracurriculars for next semester, and even planning a birthday party, my first in three years, for my sweet 16 in February. I'm also helping my grandmother around the house; I do chores, but this time, I'm getting an allowance. Even my sleep has improved. It's a whole new way of living, and it's kind of overwhelming, but I've never been happier.\n\nHopefully, this is the last time I post. I'm going to log off Reddit and go out with my grandmother for some shopping.\n\nThank you all.", "created_utc": 1689555795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151nbi8/update_aita_for_running_away_from_home/", "score": 2567, "replies": ["I am so, so glad you're okay and doing well and enjoying your life like you should have been. I hope everything goes fantastic for you and your grandmother. \n\nOP's Granmother, you are a very generous and noble woman and I wish you and your granddaughter all the best.", "Enjoy being free my friend. We need more grannies like yours. \n\nGood luck in life.", "I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re living safely with your grandmother. You\u2019re grandmother truly advocated for you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not alone. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel bad for your little brother. \nI hope your parents actually stepped up and are not taking it out on him. Hopefully, this was a wake-up call for your parents.", "So glad you're in a better situation and can just enjoy being a teenager! Have a great rest of the summer!", "I love updates! Wonderful news. I admire you- so strong, finding your voice and forcing a change.  You will be a woman to be reckoned with, that's for sure. Enjoy your summer, and I know you will excel in school this coming year.\nWell done!", "Glad things worked out for you. One question: did you get your documents, such as birth certificate and social security card? You will need those, and I don\u2019t really trust your mother", "That's a good update. \n\nGo enjoy being a kid, keep up with your classes, and don't worry about anything but being a happy and healthy kid. \n\nI hope your dad learns a lesson here. It's blatantly obvious there is a problem, and it's not OP.", "So happy to hear this!\n\nSome things to remember though...\n\nNow is the time to go completely no contact with your parents and brother.  If you have your own phone, change the number.  Block their emails and social accounts.  Take control of your life and forget they exist.  It will be hard (hopefully not as hard since they were abusing you, use that anger and hatred of them to your advantage) but you will survive.  Best of luck!", "Enjoy your freedom! And if it hasn't been said before, I'm proud of you for sticking up for yourself!", "I am glad your extended family has helped you out.  I am glad your grandmother is raising you now.\n\nGood luck in school and your future.", "This is such a sweet update I am so happy for you. Enjoy your summers and make some good memories :) pursue all the interests you want to tour hearts desire.

I wish you the best.", "I'm so glad you got out of there and are with your grandmother now.  Best of luck op", "OP, I'm glad you're in a better position. To OP's grandmother, thank you for helping out. OP, enjoy being a teenager and never forget to have fun, even as an adult.", "These updates make me happy. I hope you enjoy the summer and the hobbies you couldn't do because of your parents. Your grandmother is an angel for taking care of you and looking after your well-being. I wish you all the best.\ud83d\udc96", "So glad you got out of that situation OP. I'm still not over you having to wake up at 4:30 as a 12 year old to take care of your parent's kid because your dad was too lazy to get out of bed\u2026 thanks for updating!", "I\u2019m so glad and happy for you.", "Yipeeeee live your life large OP xx", "It's wild that they were fine with getting rid of their son rather than compromise ( by which i mean raise their other child like functional parents - which they now have to do anyway).", "This is a brilliant update.  \n\nWelcome to your childhood. \n\n I wish I could send you more books", "Yay!

It looks like a good place to ask about that in Alaska is the Alaska center for resource families.  If you\u2019re actually in another state go look up NACAC find connect on the banner and then click find local adoption support.  \n\nIf you\u2019re in Alaska I understand there\u2019s something called a PFD (for those unaware that\u2019s a check the state pays annually to residents) you can work on making sure that goes to you or your caretakers.  You want to talk to a guardian ad litem about that.  \n\nAlso talk to ACRF about an adoption or guardianship stipend.\n\nYou sound like you are doing well and I work with families like yours, everyone can benefit from therapy, I encourage you to take advantage of having someone there for you that helps you keep being awesome and move to the next thing in front of you!  \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: being eligible as an independent on the FAFSA could mean some free money for college.", "Hello grandma!", "Yes, this is exactly the kind of updates we ask for!\n\nAll the best! Welcome to freedom and peace!", "Excellent. I love your grandmother.\nGo forth and prosper!", "I\u2019m super happy you got to stay with your grandma and now have a good quality of life :)\n\nWhat you were put through is parentification and a form of child abuse. I\u2019m sure many had explained this to you in your original post. \nI was also parentified and became a my 4 siblings second mother. I was forced to give up so much, while I don\u2019t regret caring for them because they are innocent in all this. I wish I never experienced that. I was also experiencing SA and other types of abuse. I hated coming home, I dreaded it. But I had no one. I\u2019m so happy to know you have your grandma and your other family members. \nEnjoy your youth and your life. Much love you to OP :)", "Right? Mine said that we're not stopping for ice cream (my mum was driving) even though she wanted it too, because I kept asking for ice cream (I'm 19; not a child). In the end, we all got ice cream", "If adopted a new birth certificate is sent automatically, the adoptive parent has to go to the social security office to get the card. If they are in a temporary guardianship or are a ward of the State they have access to legal documents to get what they need.", "It is. \n\nMy grandparents were my guardians and the FAFSA as of about a decade ago officially recognizes you as independent under legal guardianship. You do not have to report any parent income and automatically qualify.", "Thanks I verified this as well,  and I have sleepy brain, I meant to type over the age of 13, not 16", "Honestly it can be any age as long as you are under legal guardianship when you turn 18 or start school - I entered guardianship when I was 11. This situation is a teeny bit different (and I'd make sure to meet a financial advisor at the college to make sure you are doing everything by the book) but you are for the most part correct.", "Hello grandma! You\u2019re awesome for making sure your granddaughter is well taken care of. OP you did great. Good luck with everything!", "I'm so happy you're free. Your grandmother is a heroine. I hope you can thrive in this new environment. \n\nParentification is abuse. Your mother abused her. She can't anymore unless you let her. Please, for your own sake, don't let her.", "You are a young lady who is going to go places!\nI\u2019m in awe of your resilience and strength to pull yourself out of what was turning into a slave labor type situation in your own house.\nYour grandma rocks & should be applauded for stepping up to parent you as you should be - as a child not an indentured servant.\nI wish you both all the best that life can offer.", "I'm so glad this has turned out well for you. All the best going forward and enjoy your 16th when it rolls around", "So happy things have worked out for you. We all need a Grandmother like yours.", "Good luck! Your grandma is awesome!", "Grandma can order replacements for OP. Assuming they get all the paperwork for legal custody rather than just some kind of informal arrangement.", "OP mentions a lawyer, guarantee it's all legal since there's one involved. If he's worth his chickens he'll also make sure all the needed documents (birth certificate, SS card, etc) are all handed over too.", "Custody isn\u2019t adoption.", "I'm blown away your parents left a ~13 year old with a 1yr old for hours at a time. That seems wildly irresponsible. Glad to hear things are looking up for you.", "Well, congrats. And the fact that your parents let you your grandma get custody truly marks them As tge Assholes in this situation. Stay safe kiddo.\n\nAlso try and get along with your brother", "<3 Sweetheart, my heart goes with you. I'm glad you stood up for yourself and went to your granny; the mere fact that your parents agreed to give full custody to your granny, speaks volumes.

Your grandmother is really amazing too.\n\nBest of luck to you!", "You have the best nanna in the world!  Enjoy being young, free and unencumbered.", "This is a really nice update and I'm really happy for you OP!! Wishing nothing but the best!!  \n\n\nAlso your grandmother and the rest of your extended family really came in clutch!!!", "It's great to read something positive like this", "I am so happy to read this! Your brother was NEVER your responsibility. You parents chose to not give him up for adoption, they are his parents and are fully responsible for him. \nI am happy you have a nice summer and I hope you get help recovering from all this responsibility and drama. Well done on you for walking out!!!!", "Now your mother has an estranged mother and daughter, but I bet she still doesn't see herself as a problem.", "The anger I feel towards OPs parents runs so incredibly deep. They have had a baby, they chose to put OP through this. Why would they feel such entitlement towards their daughters life. They were mean to be her guardians, her protectors, her biggest supporters. They have failed. As a dad, as a parent, as a person, I am saddened by their actions. Even if they did get themselves into a situation which was difficult to manage and OP was helping them manage, the instant OP points the situation out to them, they should have been apologising and meding the relationship.", "Great that you're doing better for yourself. You deserve it! Though, if I was the grandmother or any of the other relatives, I would've looked into taking care of Matt until your parents get it together and give the much needed love and care both you and your brother deserve. Considering what they were doing to you, it's worrying on how they'll treat Matt while you're gone. Would they neglect him or emotionally abuse him?", "Even if the parents became actual parents, chances are OP would\u2019ve ended up back in the same situation, with the parent\u2019s backsliding to depending on OP.", "Agreed. OP and Matt deserve better.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s nice if they hand them over, but getting new ones for a minor you have custody shouldn\u2019t be hard at all unless they were born off the grid in a cult or something. Guardians have to be able to do things like enroll kids in school, get medical treatment, help them get licensed to drive etc.", "Yeah, I'm so glad you are somewhere safe where you actually get to be a kid.\n\nSo few happy endings on reddit.", "GOOD FOR YOU. So glad this ended well, you deserve the world. Enjoy your summer darling.", "I'm so happy that things have turned out well for you. Nobody should have to suffer a burnout (or be on the verge of a burnout) but especially at the age of 15. I will never understand why people have children and then incessantly try to palm them off onto other people. Good for you for standing up for yourself and refusing to be used by your parents. Enjoy your down time and all the best for the future xxx", "Fantastic update!", "Enjoy Your childhood again!", "Well done getting out from that Op, and granny you are amazing. I wish you both the best and enjoy the summer with your friends and I hope your Birthday party is amazing good luck.", "Your update has literally brought tears to my eyes \u2026 please tell granny that I\u2019m sending both you and her love and best wishes xx", "I love this for you.", "You most likely won't read this, considering the last part of the update, but from this stranger on the internet.
