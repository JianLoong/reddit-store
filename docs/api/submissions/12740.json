The wedding is in the height of the summer so I don't want to wear long sleeves plus who wears a long sleeved dress to a wedding anyway. My friend suggested I cover it with foundation, but that's gonna take a whole lot and I just don't want to do it quite honestly.\n\nI told my friend that I think it's best I just don't go. And now she's having a strop saying that if I was a good friend that I would cover them up for one day. And if I don't want to be a bridesmaid then to just say that and it doesn't have to mean I should just for go the whole wedding.\n\nEdit: I was only asked to be an emergency bridesmaid because the grooms brother is able to make it after originally not being able to and my friend wants to have an even number of bridesmaids and groomsmen. As for why not just go as a regular guest, to be completely honest I just can't be honest with the drama. Even as a regular guest I'm gonna be self-concious about it all, plus I don't know anyone going except for the bridesmaid and the day isn't about me so I just thought it would be better to remove myself from the situation entirely\n\nBut tbh I don't really care about not going. I don't like weddings anyway and if she's gonna be this picky about tattoos then I'd rather not deal with her.\n\nTLDR: Friend says I have to cover my tattoos if I want to be a bridesmaid so I've decided not to go to the wedding at all", "created_utc": 1679302837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wdhf3/aita_for_not_going_to_my_friends_wedding_because/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's TA for being such a bridezilla about your tattoos, it's not reasonable for her to ask you to cover them up; unless she is picking and buying the bridesmaids outfits for all of you. \nYou're kinda TA for walking out altogether. If she had invited you as a guest you would probably have gone regardless of your dislike for weddings. You're only not going at all because of her attitude. Are you going to ditch the friendship altogether over this? If so, don't bother going to the wedding. If not, go to the damn wedding.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDOn't cover your tatoos.

Asking a bridesmaid to cover their tattoos is a certain level of asshole, but turning that request into bridesmaid or not there at all is a whole other level. Who has rejected the option to attend the wedding as a guest with visible tattoos? Is that the bride or the OP?", "Tattoos are a part of your identity. Your friend was wrong to ask you to cover them up. But you could\u2019ve still attended the wedding.

There are numerous ways to cover them up cheaply/affordably. Even if you didn't want to, you could step down from your bridesmaid role and come as a normal guest. No need to be \"self conscious\" about tattoos you chose to get, unless you feel that they were a mistake. Is \"the drama\" so painful that you would rather not attend than go watch your friend on the modt important day of her life?", "YTA for saying you won't go to the wedding at all.  It's completely fair to say that you won't cover your tats to be a bridesmaid, but this person is still your friend and still wants you to attend the wedding, right?  You say, \"the day isn't about me so I just thought it would be better to remove myself from the situation entirely\", but everything doesn't have to be about you.", "NTA\n\nYou are a person, not a prop.", "NTA. She knew you has tattoos when she asked.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. If I loved a friend enough to ask them to stand with me at my wedding, I would was to look back on my pictures and SEE THAT FRIEND. Not some carefully curated Insta-friendly faux version of that friend.", "AITA has really deepened my dislike of wedding culture.", "That's the thing, I don't think we are particularly close. Prehaps more to do with my own issues on what makes a friendship. But I'm already a last minute addition, the grooms brother was originally not gonna make it but now he can and my friend wants an even number of bridesmaids and groomsmen or something.", "It's always that they don't have that \"traditional wedding\" look, or that the bride is afraid that people will look away from her face when they see a brightly colored tattoo in the picture.", "Does the friendship mean so little to the bride that she can't accept her friend for how she is tattoos and all.", "There's a huge difference between wearing a certain type of clothing on your body and covering something that is a part of your body. If the girl was bald what would the bride ask? Wear a wig because it's \"MY WEDDING DAY\"?! It is a matter of choice here. If the bride was a great friend she could've accepted her the way she is and not consider that something so small can wreck the wedding pictures!", "Mine too....the whole \"IT'S MY SPECIAL DAY\" ....it's just a normal day for everyone else aside from close family.", "Add that to your post.  She only asked you because she needed an emergency bridesmaid.  Beggars can't be choosers", "If I were you I would tell her that you would be willing to allow her to get a professional makeup artist to cover up your arm at her cost. \n\nOtherwise no dice.\n\nBut you are under no obligation to use that suggestion, obviously. NTA", "That is a valid point, yes. Apparently the look of her wedding pictures is more important to her. I still think she could at least feel bad about that and would be happy to have her friend there anyway. Personally, I don't think the tattoos should bother her, but I do see how \"perfect\" pictures are constantly being shoved into our faces, defining how we think a wedding should look, and I do see the possibility that the bride is torn between these images and her friendship with someone who doesn't fit into them.", "I disagree, the wedding day is about the bride and groom, and bridesmaids are there to support the bride. Tattoos and baldness aren\u2019t the same at all.\nThe OP is a shitty friend, and making someone else\u2019s wedding about her.", "I understand the \"special day\" thing; weddings **are** special days.\n\nThat being said...\n\n* Expecting all guests to wear specific colors?\n* Spending $100,000?\n* Expecting people to cover tattoos or change their hair color?\n* Expecting people to spend thousands of dollars to travel to destination weddings?\n\n...is all fairly awful.", "My god. She didn't get 10000 tattoos right on the day of her wedding. That would've been the moment where she's trying to make it about herself by doing something on the wedding day. Obviously the wedding day is about the bride and groom but who becomes this ignorant for their wedding day that they expect their FRIEND to just change the whole appearance?! \nIf she wanted to make this about her she would've got tattoos right on the day of the wedding with an expected outburst from them. \nObviously baldness and tattoos aren't the same it's the part of the body that I'm talking about. Just like baldness will be a part of someone's body and you can't expect them to wear a wig for your wedding photos. Similarly tattoos are literally on her body which she can do nothing about.", "There\u2019s a concept called formal attire, covering tattoos would fall under that category. I\u2019ve had to cover my tattoos for work and events. That\u2019s part of life, there are dress codes for certain events. \nTattoos are also elective, one is not born with them. The OP is TA for not even considering some kind of compromise. Again, she\u2019s making someone else\u2019s event about her.", "That's the point. You make the choice of hiding your tattoos because you want to. Just because she doesn't want to it doesn't make her TA. You want to hide parts of your appearance it's your choice she doesn't need to do the same. She would've been TA if she would've gotten those tattoos on the wedding day Or something.", "No, you\u2019re missing my point completely. There are still events that require formal attire, and have dress codes. The OP doesn\u2019t get this and can\u2019t bothered to try to accommodate another person\u2019s wishes, and is blowing off the event entirely. Especially because there are numerous easy solutions to this problem. \n\nNot going to a persons wedding is a pretty bad snub, and this will probably lead to the end of this friendship. IF the OP\u2019s tattoos are that important, than she should politely decline to be a bridesmaid, but still attend the wedding. She isn\u2019t taking this seriously, and that\u2019s why I think she is TA."]}
