Just like baldness will be a part of someone's body and you can't expect them to wear a wig for your wedding photos.

BUT, I do kinda feel like you should probably should still go as a guest. \nPotentially unpopular opinion, but I can kinda see where the bride is coming from here. I don\u2019t have a problem with tattoos (several of my bridesmaids had tattoos that showed at my wedding and it was fine), but if you really do have a very bright and colorful sleeve on your whole arm I could understand how it might overly stick out and/or clash with the bridesmaids dresses. Since the tattoos are part of you I understand how you would feel like you should be entitled to keep them as they are (and I agree to an extent), but also I wouldn\u2019t want my bridesmaids to dye their hair multiple bright colors, have super colorful makeup, or wear their own rainbow colored jewelry for my wedding either. I understand that those are less permanent than tattoos, but the idea is in a similar vein. It really could be very distracting in photos and no one wants to look back at the wedding day and have their eyes immediately drawn to one of the members of the wedding party instead of the bridge and groom.\nI know that they make tattoo cover up makeup specifically for occasions like this. I\u2019m guessing your mind is already made up, but if it isn\u2019t, would you consider a compromise? Maybe if the bride paid for the tattoo makeup and you only had to put it on some of the brighter tattoos (I guess this is assuming that they don\u2019t all run into each other in a way where this isn\u2019t a possibility) / on the tattoos whose colors clash with the dress colors? Just a thought. \nYou\u2019re NTA, but this is a tough situation.", "NTA", "NTA. It's not like she didn't know you had them and it's prety disrepectful to expect someone to completely change how they look to play a part in a wedding.

It really cheapens the memories and with regard to a wedding, really adds the question of what is the purpose of the wedding? Is it because someone wants to celebrate an intimate commitment they made with friends and family or do they just want to look like they have a perfect life on instagram?", "You can't say that without knowing the tattoo.  I have a full sleeve, if I were to try to cover it with makeup, as the day goes on I'd end up with makeup all over my dress and the tattoo showing anyway.  Cheap foundation?  Lol, I don't know about you, but cheap foundation aint gonna cover my tattoo.  It will look like a tattoo with cheap foundation smeared all over it", "Bad bot!

That's ick. Let's stop treating tattoos like they're taboo or make someone less formal or professional.", "NTA. There is no way in hell I would cover my tattoos up for any of my friends. I don\u2019t care how much I love them. I definitely wouldn\u2019t go. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d want to be friends with them anymore.", "NTA. Her wedding, she doesn't want the tats visible. You choose not to go. Problem solved.", "NTA she either wants to as you or she isn't really your friend. I know you said you weren't going but my bf is suggesting a dress with a tattoo like design on the sleeves if you wanna piss her off, you covered them as asked she didn't specify with what.", "Cover your tatts as the bride has requested with a sheer sleeve or makeup or step down as bridesmaid. Pretty simple. You may not be the asshole, but you sure are petty not to show up at the wedding.", "Nah. Honestly? They make special foundation to cover up arm tattoos. You could do that.", "NTA. \n\nyou are not the asshole, she is not your real friend", "Nta for not wanting to cover the tattoos. YTA for not going at all. Your excuse is childish at best", "NTA and she isn\u2019t either. Everyone in my wedding had tattoos and everyone covered them. You don\u2019t want to go\u2026 just tell her you don\u2019t want to go. Attend the other bridal events and move along.", "NTA, it would take a ridiculous amount of cover up to actually hide the tattoo so you\u2019d be getting make up on anyone you hug or put your arm around. Your friend seems to be taking the bride power to a weird level. She\u2019s also insinuating that she\u2019s ashamed of your appearance which is rude. Doesn\u2019t sound like a true friend.", "NTA I was one of my sisters maids of honor, the other being my other sister. I asked the bride if she wanted me to take out my septum ring, or if she had a specific way she wanted me to do my make up. Her response was \u201cno. I want you to be yourself.\u201d And I was also a bridesmaid in a friends wedding who very gently and politely asked me to flip my septum ring up for pictures which was absolutely no problem at all. There are minor things that are 100% doable but in neither of these situations was I asked to do anything drastic. If your friend has such a problem with your appearance why would they want you as a friend in the first place. Don\u2019t go to the wedding. Don\u2019t talk to the friend. That\u2019s my opinion.", "Honestly love this idea", "Photoshop would take care of it in the formal photos. If she is not wanting to see the tattoos in ANY pictures from her wedding then a. She is not really her friend, and b. It's better she doesn't go.", "That's fair enough. I was trying to think why the bride may have panicked (although she still should have tried to find a middle ground) but I don't think any relatives there etc would be particularly bothered by cartoon animals. \n\nYou sound reasonable so I'm sure if the bride had said \"do you mind if I get a couple of shots with you using a wrap as backup photos? I'm concerned the colours may clash with the dresses but we can have all the other photos taken as normal\" then you would have been ok with that. The bride has gone straight to extremes though, which is a real shame.", "NTA. The demands people feel weirdly comfortable making just because it is their wedding day have gotten out of control.", "NTA. Honestly, if the tats are a problem, I guarantee the professional wedding photographer can either position the wedding party to hide your tattoos or photoshop them out--dunno your thoughts on this but I hate this idea, I have tattoos and if they were edited out because of \"Aesthetics!!!\" I'd flip the bride off.", "NTA and I think this bride\u2019s request is pathetic, uncool, and gross. Weddings should be a celebration with people you love. It should be a fun occasion with everyone there being themselves. Not some weird overly controlled environment where the bride\u2019s \u201caesthetic\u201d comes above all else. People really lose sight of what\u2019s important for this event and I think that\u2019s pretty whack. Your tattoos are part of who you are. They\u2019re part of your skin. Any friend who can\u2019t accept that isn\u2019t really a good friend at all. Plus, covering tattoos with makeup is an extremely time-consuming and skilled process and the makeup could potentially transfer onto clothing even with your best efforts. Our differences in appearance and style and our choices of body mods make the world a more unique and colorful place. Having everyone look the same is boring lol.", "ESH.

Doesn't seem like either one of you are such good friends after all.", "YTA", "Soft YTA for giving up on a way to be there. You could cover arms for main photos. Some kind of a shawl or something will do. She would be the AH if she policed that for the whole wedding if so ignore it.", "Lol.no. not remotely an asshole for that.", "I do agree. But Photoshop is also something that can take quite a bit of time too. And yeah, it probably better if she doesn't go at all.", "Is posing not a thing anymore?
