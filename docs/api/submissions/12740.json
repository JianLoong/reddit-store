She didn't get 10000 tattoos right on the day of her wedding. That would've been the moment where she's trying to make it about herself by doing something on the wedding day.

Just like baldness will be a part of someone's body and you can't expect them to wear a wig for your wedding photos. Similarly tattoos are literally on her body which she can do nothing about.", "There\u2019s a concept called formal attire, covering tattoos would fall under that category.

BUT, I do kinda feel like you should probably should still go as a guest. \nPotentially unpopular opinion, but I can kinda see where the bride is coming from here. I don\u2019t have a problem with tattoos (several of my bridesmaids had tattoos that showed at my wedding and it was fine), but if you really do have a very bright and colorful sleeve on your whole arm I could understand how it might overly stick out and/or clash with the bridesmaids dresses. Since the tattoos are part of you I understand how you would feel like you should be entitled to keep them as they are (and I agree to an extent), but also I wouldn\u2019t want my bridesmaids to dye their hair multiple bright colors, have super colorful makeup, or wear their own rainbow colored jewelry for my wedding either. I understand that those are less permanent than tattoos, but the idea is in a similar vein. It really could be very distracting in photos and no one wants to look back at the wedding day and have their eyes immediately drawn to one of the members of the wedding party instead of the bridge and groom.\nI know that they make tattoo cover up makeup specifically for occasions like this. I\u2019m guessing your mind is already made up, but if it isn\u2019t, would you consider a compromise? Maybe if the bride paid for the tattoo makeup and you only had to put it on some of the brighter tattoos (I guess this is assuming that they don\u2019t all run into each other in a way where this isn\u2019t a possibility) / on the tattoos whose colors clash with the dress colors? Just a thought. \nYou\u2019re NTA, but this is a tough situation.", "NTA", "NTA. It's not like she didn't know you had them and it's prety disrepectful to expect someone to completely change how they look to play a part in a wedding. Removal isn't an option and cover-up makeup is expensive and messy.  \nMy friend did something very similar. Her wedding was kind of a rush since there was a surprise pregnancy - it was planned and executed in under two months.
