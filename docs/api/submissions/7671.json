They said it was too hard for them to see.\n\nI guess everyone grieves differently, fair enough.\n\nBut it's mostly what comes after that made me go low contact. Following my dad's death and funeral, not one of them called, texted, messaged, wrote a letter - whatever, anything - to ask how we were.\n\nNo-one offered either practical or financial help, in fact we were criticized for doing a very small, low-budget funeral for only a handful of people.\n\nHonestly after dealing with all this...I didn't feel the need to reach out.\n\nI'm not even angry or resentful, I just came to the realization that I totally do not need these people in my life.\n\nNow I know through the one cousin I DO still talk to (he's cool) that uncle Harry had cancer. He had it for a few years now, but kived for it for a while  unknown how long he had.\n\nWell, he died at the end of December.\n\nBut here's the thing - my boyfriend and I had already planned a ten day vacation on that date. He already had free days from work (and my college doesn't have classes then).\n\nEverything was booked and paid for. So I wrote my aunt a condolence card, but told me I could not attend. Told my cousin I'm sorry on messenger.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I left on vacation and it was lovely.

You sent a card and offered your condolences.  That's enough.", "NTA. You sent a card which was very respectful, however cancelling your holiday for someone you haven't seen in years' funeral is a lot to ask. Why is attendance more important in death than life? I've never understood it.", "They didn't bother to send you a card he died with the information of the wake and funeral? And you still send the aunt a condolencecard?

You did more than enough by sending  the messages. If they really needed you there, they could have waited to have the funeral.", "NTA", "NTA: You had a trip already booked and paid.

A funeral is for the people that are left behind.\n\nI have a close family and my sons both have moved overseas to work and my stepdad (of 40 years) is 92, so they may not see him again. I know that neither he, my mum nor me would expect them to come back for his funeral. They spent time with him before he left and that's more important.\n\nIn fact, I'd be more annoyed if people I hadn't seen for years came to my funeral! It's not that I don't agree with many social conventions but, here, it would be hypocritical to go to a funeral when you didn't see him when he was alive.", "NTA. You acknowledged with a card and made sure your cousin knew you were sorry for his loss. He's the only one you need to worry about since you're close, and you said he understood.

You had no relationship with that part of the family for some time. Sending a card was a nice gesture. Personally if you were really close and had a wonderful relationship I'd think your relative would want you to go and have a lovely time. If you don't then you don't need to care either way, but in any case you're nta.", "NTA. Funerals are not mandatory. They are for the people left behind who want to mourn/celebrate/support.\n\nYou weren't close enough to need to do that. And if the people left behind are taking attendance and getting het-up about it, that's fine, I guess, but it's a them problem.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't close and you had a 10 day vacation paid for.", "Considering that you don't value the relationship with them, does it even matter if you are the AH?  You don't care about them or see them ever, so why would you care what they think of you?", "Life is for the living.", "NTA. There's nothing else to say.", "NTA. No need to be concerned about the opinions of people that you don't have contact with. You expressed your condolences appropriately. They are grieving, and everything has a fine point on it right now. Ignore it, and your cousin doesn't need to be giving you reports about what they're saying because that doesn't do any good except to stir up trouble.", "NTA.", "Certainly NTA.\n\n\nI don't know if this is colored by the fact that I come from a large family, but this is such a non-issue even if you had good contact with them throughout the years.", "NTA\n\nThe fact you\u2019d not had contact with for the last few years pretty much says it all.  You are not required to put aside a major planned trip to attend a funeral, particularly when you hasn\u2019t had close contact.", "NTA\n\n You sent a card, that's more than they ever did. \nPlus, it wouldn't be fair to your bf to cancel vacation when he already took off work.", "NTA", "NTA, but it's strange that they are on your social media accounts. If you knew that, then posting vacation photos was insensitive. You could have held off for a week or two before posting the photos.", "NTA\n\nBeen in the same situation.  Am close with family and was able to visit with them - in person -- a couple days before the funeral as I was due to fly out on non-refundable vacation.  Absolutely no one questioned it.", "NTA. Life is for the living. Vacations are a pain to reschedule and funerals are hardly necessary imo especially if you don\u2019t talk to the people.", "NTA.  The card was enough.", "you also can cite mental health issues as a reason you couldn't deal with non-refundable tickets and hotel fares.  NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  Long ago you made the completely reasonable decision not to have these people in your life.  Uncle Harry was not there for you and your mom when you needed them; you were under no obligation to be there when he was buried.", "NTA.\nPeople like this are always looking for drama so you did the right thing all these years ago by cutting contact with them. They don't help when they are needed the most but are quick to point out even the slightest negative things (that are only negative in their weird sense).", "NTA. I wouldn't cancel a vacation for the funeral of someone I loved, let alone a low contact uncle. Death bed visit? Totally, because that means something. But there is no reason on earth to cancel a paid holiday to eat bad egg salad and listen to Amazing Grace. He was already dead. The only reason to cancel is if it would have brought him back to life, and if you had God-like powers, you'd be out smiting and not on Reddit.", "\"Everyone grieves in their own way. For me it's best to grieve at the beach.\"\n\nNTA.\n\nThis is not a person they really meant anything to you anymore, or was close to you at all, or was in your life in any way. There was no reason TO go to the funeral, unless you just really wanted to. And you didn't. You did fine.", "Nta you sent a nice card. Which is what one does when one already has plans.  I went on a 2 week trip to Afria the week after my dad's mom died.  We weren't close. I hadn't seen her in years.  She was nearly a stranger to me, and it sounds your uncle was pretty much a stranger to you.", "nta", "NTA", "Sounds like ESH, leaning ever so slightly towards YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re right to distance yourself from family that didn\u2019t reach out to you in the past. I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve asked \u201cwhy should I go to X funeral when they didn\u2019t even shoot a text on the first Christmas after Mom died?\u201d Everyone is different, though, and some people just aren\u2019t comfortable having those conversations, especially when you\u2019re not super close to begin with.\n\nStill, going on vacation and then posting about it on social media knowing that your absence at the funeral would be noted is an AH move. It probably wouldn\u2019t have been as big a deal had you not shared pictures of you having mojitos in Belize or whatever while they were in mourning. \n\nYou were under no real obligation to go to the funeral if you had made your thoughts known, but if you didn\u2019t express your grievances to your family prior to this then you really can\u2019t blame them for not knowing how you felt; people aren\u2019t mind readers.", "Soft YTA. It makes sense that you weren't close to your uncle but I can understand why the rest of your family would have wanted you to attend the funeral. Even if your uncle did not prioritize family ties, the funeral was an opportunity for you prioritize them yourself. You being their would have been a meaningful show of support for those your uncle left behind and a time to connect with them and strengthen bonds. You were understandbly upset that your uncle ignored you after someone you loved died, and to your family you skipping the funeral to go on vacation may have had the same impact on them. They may have felt ignored in their time of grief, especially if your family is from a culture where attending someone's funeral is seen as very important even if you weren't close to them. It takes two to tango and if you want other family bonds not to fizzle out like they did with your uncle you will have to put in some efffort to reach out yourself sometimes even if it can feel one-sided at first.", "My aunt cited her mental health issues as a reason she couldn't deal with it. Unsure about the uncles. Also honestly I ALSO have mental health issues but I HAD to deal with it, you know? Someone had to bury him.", "To clarify: they did send a card with the information of his funeral. But that was the first communication in years.", "The Mental issues that kept them away from his deathbed also kept them from being able to send a card or call when it\u2019s you who\u2019s suffering but you should put your life on hold to be there when it\u2019s your uncle. No thank u.", "If she expects you to understand her reasoning for not being able to look after you after your father passed then she should also understand your reasoning for not attending the funeral of the uncle you haven't spoken to in years. But of course she only expects you to understand her side but will make no effort to understand your reasoning (which is legit).", "Nta", "Nope, you're NTA to at least me on this. It was a relative, sure, but you weren't all that close to them. Why should you walk away from money and lose out on something like that for someone that didn't seem to care all that much about you?", "Nah. It's no bad thing that you didn't go. But they were 'not amused'? They didn't say or do anything to you. They just didn't like that you were on vacation. That is ok to.", "Info: your dad died a few years ago and your uncle first got cancer a few years ago. Did these two overlap? Could your uncles cancer be a factor in why your aunt didn\u2019t have the ability to show up more? It\u2019s incredibly hard to lose a parent and makes it difficult to see the lives and pain other people are experiencing at the same time as you.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily an asshole for not missing vacation but I think it\u2019s so sad when relationships fade to animosity when no one wanted to cause hurt but had too much of their own pain to help each other out. Not sure if that\u2019s the case here but it seems possible", "OP says they came to the realization that they don't need those people in their life, so sending a card was fine and all that was necessary.", "As far as I know, they did not.\n\nI only heard about my Uncle's diagnosis (through another relative) maybe 7 or 8 months after my father's death.\n\nObviously I'm not privy to what exactly went on with his diagnosis.\n\nBut as far as I know they're chronological, not overlapping events.", "NTA.  Some people feel really strong about attendance at funerals.  Like REALLY strong.  If you aren't one of them, I don't think it is disrespectful - Like you said, people mourn in different ways.\n\nBe there for your cousin.  Make sure to reach out once a month and see how he's doing.  This is what you had hoped for in your situation, so please make sure to treat him the way you wanted to be treated.  \n\nI will say though.. that having expectations of them after your Dad died for support...  I get it, but I disagree.  Yes, a phone call would have been nice.  Financial support?  While I know that you are \"reacting\" to the way that you feel like you were treated after your Dad died (which was important to you), how would you feel if you saw a \"AITA\" post about the people who chose a vacation instead of supporting them?  It was literally the final obligation, after all.", "NTA.", "NTA - One of my uncles was the only one of dads side who was actually talking to him at the time of his death. \nHe told me that it was to hard for him to come to the funeral.\nMind you the rest of dads family who he hasn\u2019t spoken to in years (issues between my mum and dad) all showed up.\n\nI have gone no contact with that uncle and if he were to pass away, I probably wouldn\u2019t attend either \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. You were kind and send a card. Good enough.", "Eh, if a relative of mine had an already-planned and paid vacation scheduled during a family funeral, I would not hold that against them and would love to see the photos. Especially if they expressed their sympathy and support in other ways.", "NTA. funerals are tricky but if they can\u2019t bother supporting you, I don\u2019t see why they should expect your support", "Harry did show up at the hospital so it\u2019s not like he did nothing, but I feel if it wasn\u2019t on the vacation date you would\u2019ve went so all in all I\u2019ll say NTA but I get why they\u2019d be upset", "NTA", "Still NTA. You didn't have to send a card or tell (explain?) why you wouln't attend. Grief often makes people angry looking for s.o. to be their scapegoat. Don't let it get you down. Maybe make it so that that part of the family don't get to see your hollydaypictures on social media."]}
