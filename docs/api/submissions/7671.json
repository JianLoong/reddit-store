They said it was too hard for them to see.\n\nI guess everyone grieves differently, fair enough.\n\nBut it's mostly what comes after that made me go low contact. Following my dad's death and funeral, not one of them called, texted, messaged, wrote a letter - whatever, anything - to ask how we were.\n\nNo-one offered either practical or financial help, in fact we were criticized for doing a very small, low-budget funeral for only a handful of people.\n\nHonestly after dealing with all this...I didn't feel the need to reach out.\n\nI'm not even angry or resentful, I just came to the realization that I totally do not need these people in my life.\n\nNow I know through the one cousin I DO still talk to (he's cool) that uncle Harry had cancer. He had it for a few years now, but kived for it for a while  unknown how long he had.\n\nWell, he died at the end of December.\n\nBut here's the thing - my boyfriend and I had already planned a ten day vacation on that date. He already had free days from work (and my college doesn't have classes then).\n\nEverything was booked and paid for. So I wrote my aunt a condolence card, but told me I could not attend. Told my cousin I'm sorry on messenger.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I left on vacation and it was lovely. I heard later that my mom also didn't end up going, because it's a bit of a drive she also had some health issues.\n\nBut upon coming back, I heard through my cousin that that side of the family was not amused I was not there (he himself gets it).

Family wants you when they need something.  Who cares if they are pissed off?  Based on your description of what happened, IMO these people should be invisible.", "NTA...Funerals are for the living, and the living people on that side of the family are not important fixtures in your life.  You sent a card and offered your condolences.  That's enough.", "NTA. You sent a card which was very respectful, however cancelling your holiday for someone you haven't seen in years' funeral is a lot to ask. Why is attendance more important in death than life? I've never understood it.", "They didn't bother to send you a card he died with the information of the wake and funeral? And you still send the aunt a condolencecard? NTA Even if they had informed you personally, no one gets to force s.o. to go to a funeral.", "NTA- they're related to you because of blood or law but they don't sound like family", "NTA,\n\nNot everyone needs to attend a funeral.  You did more than enough by sending  the messages. If they really needed you there, they could have waited to have the funeral.", "NTA", "NTA: You had a trip already booked and paid. It's a family member that you have not been super close to for years. \nAnyone saying you are are an AH is likely resentful just because you got a vacation. Or want to pretend they are high-and-mighty, holy-than-thou attitude.", "No. NTA. For reasons you explained.", "NTA\n\nYou're not obligated to go to the funeral of someone you went no contact with.\n\nIf others have a problem with it, that's their fault for not understanding why you went no contact with them.", "NTA, if it were me, even if I were very close to them, I would not expect my friends or family to cancel a holiday to attend my funeral. A funeral is for the people that are left behind.\n\nI have a close family and my sons both have moved overseas to work and my stepdad (of 40 years) is 92, so they may not see him again. I know that neither he, my mum nor me would expect them to come back for his funeral. They spent time with him before he left and that's more important.\n\nIn fact, I'd be more annoyed if people I hadn't seen for years came to my funeral! It's not that I don't agree with many social conventions but, here, it would be hypocritical to go to a funeral when you didn't see him when he was alive.", "NTA. You acknowledged with a card and made sure your cousin knew you were sorry for his loss. He's the only one you need to worry about since you're close, and you said he understood. To reschedule a pre-paid vacation for the funeral of a distant uncle is not a reasonable expectation. It's very telling that your mother also didn't go.", "NTA. You already had this planned. If you feel the need to be there for the family, it is more important to be there after the funeral anyways - that is when grief really sets in. I\u2019m sorry for your family\u2019s loss.", "NTA, you are an adult and can do whatever you want. Sounds like you weren't close with the family anymore.

However, I can't help but feel you do hold animosity for them not doing more for you during your father's passing..or else you wouldn't have elaborated on it so much.

You had no relationship with that part of the family for some time. Sending a card was a nice gesture. Personally if you were really close and had a wonderful relationship I'd think your relative would want you to go and have a lovely time. If you don't then you don't need to care either way, but in any case you're nta.", "NTA. Funerals are not mandatory. They are for the people left behind who want to mourn/celebrate/support.\n\nYou weren't close enough to need to do that. And if the people left behind are taking attendance and getting het-up about it, that's fine, I guess, but it's a them problem.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't close and you had a 10 day vacation paid for.", "Considering that you don't value the relationship with them, does it even matter if you are the AH?  You don't care about them or see them ever, so why would you care what they think of you?", "Life is for the living.", "NTA. There's nothing else to say.", "NTA. No need to be concerned about the opinions of people that you don't have contact with. You expressed your condolences appropriately. They are grieving, and everything has a fine point on it right now. Ignore it, and your cousin doesn't need to be giving you reports about what they're saying because that doesn't do any good except to stir up trouble.", "NTA.", "Certainly NTA.\n\n\nI don't know if this is colored by the fact that I come from a large family, but this is such a non-issue even if you had good contact with them throughout the years.", "NTA\n\nThe fact you\u2019d not had contact with for the last few years pretty much says it all.  You are not required to put aside a major planned trip to attend a funeral, particularly when you hasn\u2019t had close contact.", "NTA\n\n You sent a card, that's more than they ever did. \nPlus, it wouldn't be fair to your bf to cancel vacation when he already took off work.", "NTA", "NTA, but it's strange that they are on your social media accounts. If you knew that, then posting vacation photos was insensitive. You could have held off for a week or two before posting the photos.", "NTA\n\nBeen in the same situation.  Am close with family and was able to visit with them - in person -- a couple days before the funeral as I was due to fly out on non-refundable vacation.  Absolutely no one questioned it.", "NTA. Life is for the living. Vacations are a pain to reschedule and funerals are hardly necessary imo especially if you don\u2019t talk to the people.", "NTA.  The card was enough.", "you also can cite mental health issues as a reason you couldn't deal with non-refundable tickets and hotel fares.  NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  Long ago you made the completely reasonable decision not to have these people in your life.  Uncle Harry was not there for you and your mom when you needed them; you were under no obligation to be there when he was buried.", "NTA.\nPeople like this are always looking for drama so you did the right thing all these years ago by cutting contact with them. They don't help when they are needed the most but are quick to point out even the slightest negative things (that are only negative in their weird sense).", "NTA. I wouldn't cancel a vacation for the funeral of someone I loved, let alone a low contact uncle. Death bed visit? Totally, because that means something. But there is no reason on earth to cancel a paid holiday to eat bad egg salad and listen to Amazing Grace. He was already dead. The only reason to cancel is if it would have brought him back to life, and if you had God-like powers, you'd be out smiting and not on Reddit.", "\"Everyone grieves in their own way. For me it's best to grieve at the beach.\"\n\nNTA.\n\nThis is not a person they really meant anything to you anymore, or was close to you at all, or was in your life in any way. There was no reason TO go to the funeral, unless you just really wanted to. And you didn't. You did fine.", "Nta you sent a nice card. Which is what one does when one already has plans.  I went on a 2 week trip to Afria the week after my dad's mom died.  We weren't close. I hadn't seen her in years.  She was nearly a stranger to me, and it sounds your uncle was pretty much a stranger to you.", "nta", "NTA", "Sounds like ESH, leaning ever so slightly towards YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re right to distance yourself from family that didn\u2019t reach out to you in the past. I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve asked \u201cwhy should I go to X funeral when they didn\u2019t even shoot a text on the first Christmas after Mom died?\u201d Everyone is different, though, and some people just aren\u2019t comfortable having those conversations, especially when you\u2019re not super close to begin with.\n\nStill, going on vacation and then posting about it on social media knowing that your absence at the funeral would be noted is an AH move. It probably wouldn\u2019t have been as big a deal had you not shared pictures of you having mojitos in Belize or whatever while they were in mourning. \n\nYou were under no real obligation to go to the funeral if you had made your thoughts known, but if you didn\u2019t express your grievances to your family prior to this then you really can\u2019t blame them for not knowing how you felt; people aren\u2019t mind readers.", "Soft YTA. It makes sense that you weren't close to your uncle but I can understand why the rest of your family would have wanted you to attend the funeral. Even if your uncle did not prioritize family ties, the funeral was an opportunity for you prioritize them yourself. You being their would have been a meaningful show of support for those your uncle left behind and a time to connect with them and strengthen bonds. You were understandbly upset that your uncle ignored you after someone you loved died, and to your family you skipping the funeral to go on vacation may have had the same impact on them. They may have felt ignored in their time of grief, especially if your family is from a culture where attending someone's funeral is seen as very important even if you weren't close to them. It takes two to tango and if you want other family bonds not to fizzle out like they did with your uncle you will have to put in some efffort to reach out yourself sometimes even if it can feel one-sided at first.", "My aunt cited her mental health issues as a reason she couldn't deal with it. Unsure about the uncles. Also honestly I ALSO have mental health issues but I HAD to deal with it, you know? Someone had to bury him.", "To clarify: they did send a card with the information of his funeral. But that was the first communication in years.", "The Mental issues that kept them away from his deathbed also kept them from being able to send a card or call when it\u2019s you who\u2019s suffering but you should put your life on hold to be there when it\u2019s your uncle. No thank u.", "If she expects you to understand her reasoning for not being able to look after you after your father passed then she should also understand your reasoning for not attending the funeral of the uncle you haven't spoken to in years. But of course she only expects you to understand her side but will make no effort to understand your reasoning (which is legit)."]}
