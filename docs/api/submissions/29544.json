Here's what he thought was important for the sake of the story:\n\n\\- My friend of about 17 years (Delilah, 37f) had a very problematic childhood. She barely went to school because her only parent was addicted to substances among many other problems. I don't know how she slipped through the system for so long but she was pretty much a lost cause by high school because of how little discipline she had. \n\n\\- At 23 her dad died and due to the matter of death, Delilah won a somewhat large sum of money.\n\n\\- Once she got that money, Delilah chose to go to a community college. I guess she learned to love learning and had so many interest she never knew about that she went to several schools in most of her 20s and came out with several degrees.\n\nSo my view: I've held my tongue on her wasting so much money on school. I guess if it was my money I'd want to save it or explore then get a degree, not go head first. She has 6 degrees and to me it's just silly. The real kicker is my husband is an engineer and makes more than she does, despite all her side jobs and projects. \n\nWell we were visiting her and she mentioned how she wanted to study history and maybe take a class or two online for the fun of it. I laughed and asked if any of her inheritance was still even left. She said that shouldn't be my concern. I admitted it was ridiculous, she could have just bought a nice house with that money, instead of blowing it on degrees that she doesn't even use.\n\nShe told me all her degrees served a purpose, she loves what she does now and loves learning because she was deprived of it as a child. She told me she wasn't going to defend herself to someone who did not grow in a similar situation.\n\nMy husband told her to calm down. After is now awkward and I'm not sure if I need to apology or not.

I wonder if all this hate and jealousy is stemming from the fact you didn't get to attend school after high school. You said your husband makes more money than her and not you so my question is are YOU making more money than her? \n\nIt doesn't matter if she spends her money on drugs or spending it on nothing but shoes and electronics because guess what? It's her money and she can do as she pleases with it. \n\nAlso she is a literal icon to me. I haven't been doing well in school much (better than her by how you explained it) so Delilah (Also my name but without the H) is giving me hope that I can still try and make it into school and my dream career.", "YTA Maybe her end goal is learning, not making money.

Why is that a kicker? Just because you don\u2019t see the value in her degrees doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there. SHE finds value in it, therefore it has value.

For someone you call a friend, the way you describe her in the post is not how I would talk about my friends. You don't sound like you like her at all.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI decided to post this with the help of my husband (who is unsure if my behavior was over the line). Here's what he thought was important for the sake of the story:\n\n\\- My friend of about 17 years (Delilah, 37f) had a very problematic childhood. She barely went to school because her only parent was addicted to substances among many other problems. I don't know how she slipped through the system for so long but she was pretty much a lost cause by high school because of how little discipline she had. \n\n\\- At 23 her dad died and due to the matter of death, Delilah won a somewhat large sum of money.\n\n\\- Once she got that money, Delilah chose to go to a community college. I guess she learned to love learning and had so many interest she never knew about that she went to several schools in most of her 20s and came out with several degrees.\n\nSo my view: I've held my tongue on her wasting so much money on school. I guess if it was my money I'd want to save it or explore then get a degree, not go head first. She has 6 degrees and to me it's just silly. The real kicker is my husband is an engineer and makes more than she does, despite all her side jobs and projects. \n\nWell we were visiting her and she mentioned how she wanted to study history and maybe take a class or two online for the fun of it. I laughed and asked if any of her inheritance was still even left. She said that shouldn't be my concern. I admitted it was ridiculous, she could have just bought a nice house with that money, instead of blowing it on degrees that she doesn't even use.\n\nShe told me all her degrees served a purpose, she loves what she does now and loves learning because she was deprived of it as a child. She told me she wasn't going to defend herself to someone who did not grow in a similar situation.\n\nMy husband told her to calm down. After is now awkward and I'm not sure if I need to apology or not. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", "YTA - You seem like you not only have different ideas about how you\u2019d spend the money, but are genuinely contemptuous towards someone you call a \u201cfriend\u201d. And when she defends herself from your unsolicited advice, your husband joins in? You two are kinda gross.", "YTA\n\nYeah, career students low-key drive me nuts too. And YES, I can think of many other ways to better spend that money.\n\nBut.\n\nNone of it is your business. You crossed the line hard when you asked if any of her inheritance is left, and then voicing thoughts that should have been kept quiet.\n\nNo one wants to be told they frittered away their Dad's blood money. C'mon, read the room. You're being a major asshole here.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "YTA. Oooh, jealousy isn\u2019t a good look on you!", "YTA. What is wrong with you? How is what your friend does with her inheritance any of your damn business????? \n\nYou sound petty and jealous.", "YTA.  If she can pay her bills and enjoys what she's doing and enjoys learning what business is it of yours?", "YTA. She's doing something she enjoys. Schooling is her hobby. Just because you wouldn't do it doesn't mean she shouldn't. School is not all about making money afterwards. Unless you want people to shoot down your interests, don't shoot down theirs.", "YTA, literally you were a dick to her.  If she had wasted all her money gambling and buying stupid stuff, maybe it would be ok to think (and not say) that she wasted it.  But she paid for education and pursued that education in things that interested her, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.  If she wants to get 6 more degrees, more power to her.", "YTA.\n\nWow that was easy.\n\nIt's not your money. It never will be your money. She will spend it as she sees fit and your judgement whether it's worthy or not is like a fart in the wind.

The expression \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d comes to mind. I have 2 degrees, neither of which has anything to do with how I make a living.

Not drugs.  Not trips to Disneyland.  \n\nYTA.  Don\u2019t laugh at someone for getting smarter on their own dime.
