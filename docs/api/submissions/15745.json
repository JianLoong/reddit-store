I certainly wouldnt be willing to bring them into my clinic and shoulder the responsibility, which I know would happen. I love my BF, but this is a guy who thought neutering a dog involved removing their penis and even says he knows \"nothing about animals until I met you\". who is going to have to manage the situation when this dog has chronic allergic dermatitis/otitis or IVDD or one of the other million issues they typically end up having? Me. I already know it.\n\nI explained all this to him and he got quite upset with me for \"completely shutting down what he wants\". I told him a small-med dog isnt out of the question, just NOT a pug or other brachycephalic dog and not a puppy. They are far too much of a time and effort commitment than either of us can provide and wouldnt be good for anyone. I dont like to admit that I pulled the \"this is literally my career field and I know what Im talking about\" when he kept repeating \"well you dont KNOW that\".  because yeah, I kinda do.\n\nI am also not proud of this, but I told him if he did get the pug puppy I would never help him out again with money and I would give him zero help with the puppy, including bringing them into my clinic as an employee-affiliated pet for at-cost care (cheaper but by no means free) or medications. he was pretty shocked when I said this and left our apartment to go cool-off. I guess he told our mutual friend because they told me via text I was being a bitch about the whole thing and \"must hate animals\". all my coworkers agree with me, but I know they are obviously biased\n\nAITA?\n\nedit to add: this mutual friend was his best friend before we started dating and they became my friend also. or at least I thought they were. while what they said is shitty and not okay I have a hard time believing my bf actually called me that to him. even when we argue (not often, but happens) he has never used any language like that or anything even remotely disrespectful. I would not tolerate that. he is immature at times, but never like that\n\nanother edit to address some common things in the comments:\n\nmy clinic is actually PART of a shelter. I talked at length with him about how we could foster one of the dogs from work who was compatible with us and our lifestyle (size, energy, age, cat friendly, etc) before adopting and he was not happy with this. he also was not interested in mixes with pug who didnt have the extremely short face due to \"not looking like a pug anymore\". that's when I got a little more forceful with my ultimatum\n\nif we got a dog TOGETHER then I would be happy to take on the lion's share of things like medical care because this is a pet we got together and just makes sense. I got my cat before meeting him, so just MY CAT, and have never asked him to shoulder any aspect of her care other than feeding her if I was going to be home late from work or something similar\n\nwe have never had an issue like this before so that's one reason Im a bit.. lost on if I was really in the wrong or not.

A pet is something all parties have to agree on, pug or no pug. You may have pulled out the big guns to get through to him, so that is now a thing.

Even if you didn't have very serious concerns about the ethicality of owning a pug (especially one that isn't a rescue animal), it is never your responsibility to agree to care for someone else's pet.

You also sound like you are helping more than you should in other ways so reminding him of that isn\u2019t that big of a deal imo. I recommend stepping back from that in general because he needs to learn how to budget and you helping can be prolonging a bigger issue with him. You\u2019re not married so your finances should be yours and his should be his because it nice to have more money in savings if things don\u2019t work out between you two. Borrowing money from a partner or having deals that are mutually beneficial make more sense, but having a pattern of giving money adds up in the long run.", "NTA, but he probably knows that's a hollow threat.", "NTA\n\nYou know exactly and in depth what you are talking about.
