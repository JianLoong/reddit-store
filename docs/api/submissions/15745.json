NOT a Veterinarian. think of it as nurse vs doctor. just been seeing some confusion in the replies :)\n\n\nSo this situation involves me (28F) and BF (27M)\n\nwe have been together for about two years and some change. we live together and split all the main bills but the rest of our paychecks we keep separate and spend how we wish. typically this works fine. but despite him earning the same, sometimes more, than me he is not great at budgeting (he gets takeout almost every day, buys coffee out every single day, sends his god awful abusive mom money whenever she asks, etc) and I've had to help him out with money multiple times\n\nbut the real issue started when he brought up wanting to buy a pug puppy. now, I work in veterinary medicine (lead VT at my clinic) and frequently see first-hand the suffering these dogs go through due to bad breeding and even just their breed standard anatomy. plus they are prone to so many chronic expensive health issues. and Ive found over the years that no matter what the other person says, if you work in my field and they get a pet, a lot of the harder care aspects (like medical) will fall on you. and honestly, I find buying a pug at all to be unethical and something I am not okay with. I certainly wouldnt be willing to bring them into my clinic and shoulder the responsibility, which I know would happen. I love my BF, but this is a guy who thought neutering a dog involved removing their penis and even says he knows \"nothing about animals until I met you\". who is going to have to manage the situation when this dog has chronic allergic dermatitis/otitis or IVDD or one of the other million issues they typically end up having? Me. I already know it.\n\nI explained all this to him and he got quite upset with me for \"completely shutting down what he wants\". I told him a small-med dog isnt out of the question, just NOT a pug or other brachycephalic dog and not a puppy. They are far too much of a time and effort commitment than either of us can provide and wouldnt be good for anyone. I dont like to admit that I pulled the \"this is literally my career field and I know what Im talking about\" when he kept repeating \"well you dont KNOW that\".  because yeah, I kinda do.\n\nI am also not proud of this, but I told him if he did get the pug puppy I would never help him out again with money and I would give him zero help with the puppy, including bringing them into my clinic as an employee-affiliated pet for at-cost care (cheaper but by no means free) or medications. he was pretty shocked when I said this and left our apartment to go cool-off. I guess he told our mutual friend because they told me via text I was being a bitch about the whole thing and \"must hate animals\". all my coworkers agree with me, but I know they are obviously biased\n\nAITA?\n\nedit to add: this mutual friend was his best friend before we started dating and they became my friend also. or at least I thought they were. while what they said is shitty and not okay I have a hard time believing my bf actually called me that to him. even when we argue (not often, but happens) he has never used any language like that or anything even remotely disrespectful. I would not tolerate that. he is immature at times, but never like that\n\nanother edit to address some common things in the comments:\n\nmy clinic is actually PART of a shelter. I talked at length with him about how we could foster one of the dogs from work who was compatible with us and our lifestyle (size, energy, age, cat friendly, etc) before adopting and he was not happy with this. he also was not interested in mixes with pug who didnt have the extremely short face due to \"not looking like a pug anymore\". that's when I got a little more forceful with my ultimatum\n\nif we got a dog TOGETHER then I would be happy to take on the lion's share of things like medical care because this is a pet we got together and just makes sense. I got my cat before dating him, so MY cat, and have never asked him to shoulder any aspect of her care other than feeding her if I was going to be home late from work or something similar\n\nwe have never had an issue like this before so that's one reason Im a bit.. lost on if I was really in the wrong or not.

You also sound like you are helping more than you should in other ways so reminding him of that isn\u2019t that big of a deal imo. I recommend stepping back from that in general because he needs to learn how to budget and you helping can be prolonging a bigger issue with him. You\u2019re not married so your finances should be yours and his should be his because it nice to have more money in savings if things don\u2019t work out between you two. Borrowing money from a partner or having deals that are mutually beneficial makes more sense, but having a pattern of giving money adds up in the long run.", "NTA, but he probably knows that's a hollow threat.

I love dogs but also, I have depression and sometimes it is hard for me to leave the house. Fine with just a cat. Not fine with a dog. Even if that were not the case, the energy level that the average husky requires is wrong for me and my lifestyle.

HOWEVER - pugs are one of the most unethical abominations to exist. edward cannot breathe well, and has some serious reverse-sneeze attacks when he gets too excited. he has very low energy, eye problems, constant ear infections. on top of that, he has a multitude of food and environmental allergies we have yet to pin down and has resulted in hot spots; the dermatitis you speak of. VERY common for pugs:) (he got one on his face and the hair never quite fully grew back) sheds a TON and bless him but the boy cannot poop clean. every bathroom trip is a small catastrophe. pugs need a lot, they are typically stage 8 clingers. my pug is incredibly healthy and every vet we have seen has been so impressed with his build and tenacity. that is not the case for most pugs. in addition to that, it's a rarity to get a purebred pug puppy via adoption. it's mainly seniors or pugs that need serious rehab because the owners didn't realize what they were signing up for. pugs usually have to be inseminated to reproduce because they're so jacked up and it is very dangerous for female pugs to give birth. i got my pug from a pet store and while i do not regret him, i regret the decision. it's very sad to know more and feel like i played a part in a puppy mill operation. i did not have a vet tech or adjacent person in my life to provide me that information, i was uninformed and impulsive. \n\nmy bf and i broke up and i ended up having to keep edward. it's what i wanted but my god, it is expensive and it can be trying! your bf needs to understand that he's speaking to someone with lived experience, on something that is part of a field of study as well. he also needs to research this himself. pugs are not a dog that you just get, they require a lot of education and it doesn't sound like he's willing to do that. imo, he doesn't sound mature enough to have a dog...\n\nyou cannot fly most major airlines with pugs (some you can, but you have to jump thru hella hoops) and you run the risk of killing them because they simply were not put here to breathe and stay alive. pure bred pug pups are EXPENSIVE. the amount of lovable shelter dogs that need homes outweigh the human desire for name brand dogs. if he is getting a dog thinking he is getting it with you, this is a decision made by both parties and needs to be unanimous. especially if it is going to affect your living situation. that's a decision one party simply cannot make. you can say you won't provide for it but you obv have a heart for animals because of the line of work you're in and i would recommend you really think through the day an emergency vet visit he cannot afford comes. you aren't going to sit there and say \"i told u i wouldn't pay for it\" you will probably do it, and resent your partner for it. \n\nTL;DR: pug parent here: OP is NTA. bf needs to do some research of his own on pugs, brachycephalic dogs in general and the inhumane practices of breeders/puppy mills.", "NTA.
