You violated my trust and my rights as a co-parent.", "NTA You made the right call.

What did they both even expect to happen if you challenged it? It's obvious he plagiarised and did it intentionally. The D was the teacher being lenient, everywhere I know gives an instant fail if you're intentionally plagiarising", "You're NTA, but your (ex?) wife absolutely is. You're doing the right thing; and bad grades Sophomore year of highschool are NOT going to impact his ability to get into college. Junior year and Senior year are where things get more serious, and without this nip in the bud that you're giving him, the behavior will NOT change. \n\nThere's also nothing you can do to challenge the grade regardless, and definitely not with the school \ud83e\udd23 His mom is foolish to think otherwise. They gave him the D because he submitted a whole essay that wasn't his own. Not one or two sentences, but a *WHOLE* essay.\n\nThe only thing he could have done (coming from someone who used to be a teacher) would have to turn in the essay again, late, as his own work. And he would have gotten deducted a bit doing that as well, as the reason he turned it in late was because he plagiarized the first one. There's also usually the option offered to do some extra credit work on the side as a way to get some more points to help boost up his grade. \n\nBut with both of those, your son would have known regardless, as he should have either asked the teacher or she would have told him when handing him back his assignment. His mom challenging the grade would have had no bearing over him being able to boost his grade up, as he got the grade he got due to his own actions. And HE would have had to personally do the extra work to boost up his grade regardless.\n\nAdditionally, colleges don't only look at transcripts anyways. More important is the SAT and ACT scores of the applicant. And if he's plagiarizing school work, and continues to do so, it will *ALSO* be reflected in those scores.\n\nDo not let anyone bully you into feeling guilty. You are 100% in the right. What taf would grounding do to curb him plagiarizing?? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Some people have their head so far up their and their child's head, they can't even think straight. \n\nLuckily for you and your son, this one instance seems to be the wake up call he needed. Though it's hilarious he's worried about his college prospects upon getting caught, instead of the thought of the consequence stopping him from actually plagiarizing in the first place \ud83d\ude02 Thought he'd be slick enough to get past the consequences.\n\nAnd you're so right; better now than being EXPELLED from college/university. Professors do NOT take plagiarizing lightly.

Your wife is dead wrong about a high-school D hurting his college prospects.", "NTA\nWell done. You didn't allow your son to fail. He messed up. He failed all by himself. \n\nQuite frankly what could you have done? You could have raised a stink at the school, which would have made you look like an ass and changed nothing. \n\nYour son is much too old for mommy and daddy to get him out of the consequences of his actions. Your wife needs to get a grip on reality.", "NTA. The main job of a parent is to raise their child to be a productive adult. Adolescence is a time to make mistakes and learn from them. Kids do stupid things for all kinds of reasons. Doing something stupid is par for the course, but so are consequences. Parents that try to prevent their children from facing the consequences of their actions are doing them a disservice and setting them up for failure as adults. Good for you for understanding the assignment and teaching your child that cheating will not get them what they want out of life.

That's really the most important thing here.", "so nice to see a parent actually parenting their child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are correct and I applaud you. What is the kid's mom deal?  you see that all the time and then the kids can't handle it when life and folks  give him  a kick in the pants.  How in God's name this woman can face a teacher to ask for the grade to be changed is beyond me. My parents would talk to the teacher, to apologize, and drag my behind in to apologize too. And then I would be grounded, chores added etc. This would not be tolerated for the reason you state: This will not fly in his future. He could get kicked out of school, lose jobs etc.  Parents like the mom don't understand this : no one else cares about your kid. Period. No one will defend him, help him. comfort him, etc. when he screws up in the workforce. Mom listen up: teach him to be a good person, to defend himself and survive. NO ONE ELSE in the \"outside real world\" gives a crap about your kid. Dad, you rock! Keep it up.", "Devin's mom is exactly why teachers are quitting their jobs.  Kids aren't being held accountable for their actions and teachers are getting the blowback!  Heck no should the teachers decision be challenged!  Devin has two years to get his grades up and make some decisions on university and one D in English as a sophmore won't kill it all.  Well done for parenting the right way and actually teaching your son that there are consequences to all actions.", "NTA. I find it troubling that his mother views getting a zero on an assignment that he didn't actually do as a punishment. He received the grade he earned. That isn't a punishment; it's the natural consequence of his actions. I honestly think he got off easy.", "Nta what fix?  Challenge it with what? The kid purposefully cheated.", "NTA. I failed a class in highschool and had to take an online class through a university which was incredibly more difficult and cost more. \n\nThe reason I failed? I plagiarized a paper. Wanna know what never happened again through the rest of my schooling? You guessed it, Plagiarization. \n\nIt's a hard learned lesson, and he honestly got off easier than I would expect.", "NTA \n\nThe fact that not only did Devin plagiarize but he expected you to fix it is very concerning. These behaviors don\u2019t come out of nowhere, it\u2019s been building up all along and I am willing to bet he\u2019s plagiarized many times before. His mother\u2019s reaction tells me she\u2019s covered for him before. I have never been in this situation but if any of my now adult children had cheated I would let them suffer the consequences as well as a separate punishment at home.", ">.

Most schools will kick you out. He basically got a slap on the wrist.\n\nChallenging the grade is going to teach your son that cheating isn't serious. Actions have consequences.\n\nWill this impact his future? Probably. That's life though.", "NTA\n\nAll Devon's mom is doing to teaching him he can do whatever he wants, and she'll clean up the messes", "Not the AH.  \nPeople that learn to cheat continue to do so. The more they are caught when they are younger unless they have some sort of neuropathy, they eventually learn ethics. I would imagine \"the rules don't apply to me, I can get away with it\" only continues and escalates over time otherwise. You totally did the right thing and hopefully steered him a little closer to the universal rules that will make him better at University, and in life in general. Flip side is if the parent is siding with them they are teaching the opposite message, \"cheat to get ahead\" which can really mess things up for everyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The goal is for him to face the assignment and get his confidence and identity back, but not to hold his hand. You can talk about some of your academic experiences too. The temptation is always there to magically free up hours of time by cheating, but those freed up hours come at a cost. You lose skills, your sense of right and wrong, and sometimes your grade.

But neither of those indicate that you did anything wrong.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nIf a zero on one essay is enough to lower your son's grade to a D, then his grade prior to that zero was not all that high. Which means two things: 1) your son is not going to have his college future destroyed by one D, and 2) your son may be struggling as a student more than you know. A lot of kids suffer from academic skill deficits -- and a lot of kids who suffer from them get extremely good at covering for them, to the point that their parents and teachers frequently don't know there's a problem.

He may be suffering from mental health issues, or being bullied, or any of a number of other things. Again, figuring out what is actually wrong and fixing it can be life-changing for him.\n\nKids don't generally cheat in a vacuum. Sometimes they cheat because of inability (real or perceived) to do the work. Sometimes they cheat because of unreasonably high expectations; for example, his mother may be telling him that she expects some certain level of grades, or that if he doesn't get a certain level of grades, his future will be ruined. Finding out why he chose to cheat rather than to do the work will make it least as big of a difference in his life as having him deal with the consequences of his actions in this one instance.", "NTA.

Top tier colleges appreciate demonstrated growth and overcoming challenges more so than a perfect GPA from easy courses. \n\nHopefully the lesson learned here is that actions have consequences.
