You violated my trust and my rights as a co-parent.", "NTA You made the right call.

What did they both even expect to happen if you challenged it? It's obvious he plagiarised and did it intentionally. The D was the teacher being lenient, everywhere I know gives an instant fail if you're intentionally plagiarising", "You're NTA, but your (ex?) wife absolutely is. You're doing the right thing; and bad grades Sophomore year of highschool are NOT going to impact his ability to get into college. Junior year and Senior year are where things get more serious, and without this nip in the bud that you're giving him, the behavior will NOT change. \n\nThere's also nothing you can do to challenge the grade regardless, and definitely not with the school \ud83e\udd23 His mom is foolish to think otherwise. They gave him the D because he submitted a whole essay that wasn't his own. Not one or two sentences, but a *WHOLE* essay.\n\nThe only thing he could have done (coming from someone who used to be a teacher) would have to turn in the essay again, late, as his own work. And he would have gotten deducted a bit doing that as well, as the reason he turned it in late was because he plagiarized the first one. There's also usually the option offered to do some extra credit work on the side as a way to get some more points to help boost up his grade. \n\nBut with both of those, your son would have known regardless, as he should have either asked the teacher or she would have told him when handing him back his assignment. His mom challenging the grade would have had no bearing over him being able to boost his grade up, as he got the grade he got due to his own actions. And HE would have had to personally do the extra work to boost up his grade regardless.\n\nAdditionally, colleges don't only look at transcripts anyways. More important is the SAT and ACT scores of the applicant. And if he's plagiarizing school work, and continues to do so, it will *ALSO* be reflected in those scores.\n\nDo not let anyone bully you into feeling guilty. You are 100% in the right. What taf would grounding do to curb him plagiarizing?? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Some people have their head so far up their and their child's head, they can't even think straight. \n\nLuckily for you and your son, this one instance seems to be the wake up call he needed. Though it's hilarious he's worried about his college prospects upon getting caught, instead of the thought of the consequence stopping him from actually plagiarizing in the first place \ud83d\ude02 Thought he'd be slick enough to get past the consequences.\n\nAnd you're so right; better now than being EXPELLED from college/university. Professors do NOT take plagiarizing lightly.

Your wife is dead wrong about a high-school D hurting his college prospects.", "NTA\nWell done. You didn't allow your son to fail. He messed up. He failed all by himself. \n\nQuite frankly what could you have done? You could have raised a stink at the school, which would have made you look like an ass and changed nothing. \n\nYour son is much too old for mommy and daddy to get him out of the consequences of his actions. Your wife needs to get a grip on reality.", "NTA. The main job of a parent is to raise their child to be a productive adult. Adolescence is a time to make mistakes and learn from them. Kids do stupid things for all kinds of reasons. Doing something stupid is par for the course, but so are consequences. Parents that try to prevent their children from facing the consequences of their actions are doing them a disservice and setting them up for failure as adults. Good for you for understanding the assignment and teaching your child that cheating will not get them what they want out of life.

That's really the most important thing here.", "so nice to see a parent actually parenting their child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are correct and I applaud you. What is the kid's mom deal?  you see that all the time and then the kids can't handle it when life and folks  give him  a kick in the pants.  How in God's name this woman can face a teacher to ask for the grade to be changed is beyond me. My parents would talk to the teacher, to apologize, and drag my behind in to apologize too. And then I would be grounded, chores added etc. This would not be tolerated for the reason you state: This will not fly in his future. He could get kicked out of school, lose jobs etc.  Parents like the mom don't understand this : no one else cares about your kid. Period. No one will defend him, help him. comfort him, etc. when he screws up in the workforce. Mom listen up: teach him to be a good person, to defend himself and survive. NO ONE ELSE in the \"outside real world\" gives a crap about your kid. Dad, you rock! Keep it up.", "Devin's mom is exactly why teachers are quitting their jobs.  Kids aren't being held accountable for their actions and teachers are getting the blowback!  Heck no should the teachers decision be challenged!  Devin has two years to get his grades up and make some decisions on university and one D in English as a sophmore won't kill it all.  Well done for parenting the right way and actually teaching your son that there are consequences to all actions.", "NTA. I find it troubling that his mother views getting a zero on an assignment that he didn't actually do as a punishment. He received the grade he earned. That isn't a punishment; it's the natural consequence of his actions. I honestly think he got off easy.", "Nta what fix?  Challenge it with what? The kid purposefully cheated.", "NTA. I failed a class in highschool and had to take an online class through a university which was incredibly more difficult and cost more. \n\nThe reason I failed? I plagiarized a paper. Wanna know what never happened again through the rest of my schooling? You guessed it, Plagiarization. \n\nIt's a hard learned lesson, and he honestly got off easier than I would expect.", "NTA \n\nThe fact that not only did Devin plagiarize but he expected you to fix it is very concerning. These behaviors don\u2019t come out of nowhere, it\u2019s been building up all along and I am willing to bet he\u2019s plagiarized many times before. His mother\u2019s reaction tells me she\u2019s covered for him before. I have never been in this situation but if any of my now adult children had cheated I would let them suffer the consequences as well as a separate punishment at home.", ">.

Most schools will kick you out. He basically got a slap on the wrist.\n\nChallenging the grade is going to teach your son that cheating isn't serious. Actions have consequences.\n\nWill this impact his future? Probably. That's life though.", "NTA\n\nAll Devon's mom is doing to teaching him he can do whatever he wants, and she'll clean up the messes", "Not the AH.  \nPeople that learn to cheat continue to do so. The more they are caught when they are younger unless they have some sort of neuropathy, they eventually learn ethics. I would imagine \"the rules don't apply to me, I can get away with it\" only continues and escalates over time otherwise. You totally did the right thing and hopefully steered him a little closer to the universal rules that will make him better at University, and in life in general. Flip side is if the parent is siding with them they are teaching the opposite message, \"cheat to get ahead\" which can really mess things up for everyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The goal is for him to face the assignment and get his confidence and identity back, but not to hold his hand. You can talk about some of your academic experiences too. The temptation is always there to magically free up hours of time by cheating, but those freed up hours come at a cost. You lose skills, your sense of right and wrong, and sometimes your grade.

But neither of those indicate that you did anything wrong.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nIf a zero on one essay is enough to lower your son's grade to a D, then his grade prior to that zero was not all that high. Which means two things: 1) your son is not going to have his college future destroyed by one D, and 2) your son may be struggling as a student more than you know. A lot of kids suffer from academic skill deficits -- and a lot of kids who suffer from them get extremely good at covering for them, to the point that their parents and teachers frequently don't know there's a problem.

He may be suffering from mental health issues, or being bullied, or any of a number of other things. Again, figuring out what is actually wrong and fixing it can be life-changing for him.\n\nKids don't generally cheat in a vacuum. Sometimes they cheat because of inability (real or perceived) to do the work. Sometimes they cheat because of unreasonably high expectations; for example, his mother may be telling him that she expects some certain level of grades, or that if he doesn't get a certain level of grades, his future will be ruined. Finding out why he chose to cheat rather than to do the work will make it least as big of a difference in his life as having him deal with the consequences of his actions in this one instance.", "NTA.

As you said, he knew exactly what he was doing and he still chose to do it. \n\nAs for his mother, she\u2019s part of the problem with the educational system. If his scholarship opportunities are affected, that\u2019s what we call natural consequences. He will have no one to blame but himself.", "NTA. You're right. His doing something like this in college would have a much more negative effect. Is he able to retake the class for a potentially higher grade? That would be the best result.", "NTA. He cheated. Consciously and deliberately. He got caught. The consequence was a zero mark for the assignment that he did not complete. He has hopefully learned not to cheat in future.", "NTA I went to school with an Einstein the did the same thing but the pages of the essay they were plagarizing were stuck. It's simple, you cheat, you get caught, you get a zero. The teacher isn't going to change the grade.", "NTA\n\nI'm not really sure what the point of fighting the grade would be when that is the grade he earned. If anything he is lucky that he didn't get an automatic F for the whole class based on this.\n\nYou could ask the school if he has the option to retake the class and get his grade up.\n\nHonestly I think that it's really important for your son to learn this lesson now, since the consequences are not nearly as severe as they would be later in life. He really needs to understand that cheating is a serious offense that can have long lasting consequences so that he doesn't go into adulthood thinking that this is the right approach to life.\n\nI wonder if his Mom doesn't really understand the scope of what he did and how intentional it was?\n\nIt's not like he got the zero for missing a citation or something accidental. He just deliberately tried to claim someone else's work as his own.\n\nYou're being a good parent by letting him learn that actions have consequences!", "NTA.\n\nParents like Emma are the reason why teachers (and professors) are having such a tough time with their students.\n\nParents like *you* give me some small hope for the future.", "NTA. Your son cheated, he has to deal with the consequences.", "NTA- devin knew what he was doing. Ask his mommy if she plans on defending her pwecious sonny boy when he pulls this kind of crap in college and beyond. Devin's lucky he's just getting a D, my parents would have grounded his ass as well.", "People really overblow grades in college applications. It\u2019s a factor but other things like extracurriculars are also taken into account. A D in one class won\u2019t keep him out of a university. You did the right thing.

The zero was well deserved. \nEven if you challenged it, I'm doubtful they would change the zero, since it's pure plagiarism. \nAnd yeah, he deserved that zero. NTA", "NTA, and as a teacher who regularly deals with this kind of issue,  thank you!", "NTA. Plagiarism in college would get him kicked out part way through, wasting thousands of dollars and all that time and effort. Better learn that lesson now than later.", "NTA. I'm not with my son's mom anymore, but I'm confident if he'd pulled one of these we'd be in full agreement not only is he talking the zero, he will face additional repercussions from us.", "NTA. I was one of those people that blamed the teacher whenever I slacked off in class and its stupid, hated that i did that- i was the problem lmfao", "NTA. This is a lesson your son needed to learn the hard way.", "Given the battalions of amoral, unprincipled frauds and grifters in the news, who are  recently emerged alumni from Ivy League schools, and soon to be in the slammer,  I would say you've done your son a favor by teaching him the consequences of cheating.", "NTA for letting him face the consequences but YTA for not involving his mom in the decision. It sounds like you guys coparent Devin, and while I agree with your point of view, she did deserve to be notified of the issue much sooner. Anyway a D for one semester won't kill him as long as he can hit a B or higher next semester and on the final.", "NTA As a university English professor, I send you my grateful thanks for doing what all parents should do in that situation. Because of you, he can learn from this now: learn that there are consequences for plagiarism and learn to actually write well. Both of those lessons will serve him far better in college later than a fake good grade will  now. If you had done as he'd asked, and it had worked, he'd be hated by his teachers, he'd learn nothing, and when he tried to pull that nonsense in college, he'd be suspended or even expelled.", "He'll be fine and hopefully he'll never plagiarize again because that can get you thrown out of school entirely at the college level. It's not the end of the world if he doesn't get into the college of his choice either. His mother is not helping him by trying to diminish his unethical actions.", "100% NTA - OP's son is the AH for not only plagiarizing his final, but deliberately working to deceive the software which says he understood what he was doing was wrong. \n\nHigh school is as much about teaching how to interact in society as it is about teaching the actual subject. Top tier colleges appreciate demonstrated growth and overcoming challenges more so than a perfect GPA from easy courses. \n\nHopefully the lesson learned here is that actions have consequences. Being taught that cheating doesn't matter as long as someone with influence intervenes will only result in bigger consequences when he does the same in college or beyond when daddy can't bail him out.", "NTA. Devin needs to learn this lesson, apparently (even though it should go without saying). And it is so much better for him to learn now than later.", "NTA.  Good lesson to learn about stealing (which is what plagiarism is!) before it really negatively effects the rest of his life.", "Teacher speaking. It's very common nowadays for parents to defend their children when they cheat and plagiarize. They say anything from, \"It doesn't matter if they cheated, you have to let them do it over\" to \"But they didn't know they were plagiarizing.\"\n\nThe second one just astounds me. I've asked both students and parents how you can possibly copy something without knowing that you're copying it. They never have an answer but they scream and yell about it anyway. One father threatened to have me fired and also threatened to come to my house and \"teach me a lesson\" (his words) when I caught his daughter with a plagiarized essay.", "Well said", "It\u2019s also mid semester so he has until June to pull that grade up.", "If his grade dropped to a D I doubt he had an A or anything like that anyways. I've had some papers worth a huge chunk of a grade, but if we assume his grade went from a C to a D then it isn't like that makes a huge difference for college.\n\nI agree that the son should be learning the consequences now. A bad grade from sophomore year hurts less than junior or senior years. It also teaches him plagiarism doesn't work way more than a grounding at home.\u200b", "Also, it's far better he learns his lesson now.  His silly plagiarism attempt would easily get him caught for academic misconduct at university, then he would be expelled and have it on his permanent academic record.", "I don't even know what grounds op would even have to fight this on. it all kinda falls apart after \"yeah my son plagiarised but....\" ***Maybe*** they give lenience for the dad teaching him this lesson, but I as the student wouldn't count on that at all lol", "Yeah. I failed multiple classes in highschool because I was extremely depressed and just.... Didn't have the necessary support at the time. My grade 12 marks were pretty consistently decent (80-90ish) because I was in subjects I actually cared about. \n\nI ended up retaking my missing credits years later so I actually counted as graduated years after I technically finished school. \n\nI just finished my bachelor's with a 3.4 earlier this year, and got into both my uni (obviously) and surprisingly, one of the best ones in Canada. It took me a few bonus years to get to where I could be successful, but I managed it. a d won't kill his prospects if multiple F's didn't ruin mine either.", "FAFO. Sometimes that's the only way kids learn these days...", "Plus there is a difference between forgetting and copying a whole essay.", "Unless she has history of letting him get away with things", "I\u2019d say something where he ends up actually doing the essay for late/partial credit maybe, otherwise it seems like he got off easy", "That\u2019s what I was going to say. If moms so worried about college send him to summer school to retake the class and improve the grade.", "It sounds like she completely condones cheating.

I'm all in favor of consequences, but damn, that seems a bit harsh.", "Yeah\u2026she will actually need to know things to perform the job.", "Day in court?! There is no debate as to whether or not Devin plagiarized. He did. The student is clearly wrong, and attempting to undermine that teacher\u2019s authority by going to the administration will only embolden Devin more.

You can get in trouble for far less obvious or intentional plagiarism than what OP's son did, and colleges take that stuff really seriously.\n\nI almost got suspended because a professor **thought** I'd plagiarized a paper, and the issue only got dropped when I was able to show documentation in the form of my handwritten notes and emails with my study group that showed how I'd gone through several drafts before reaching my final version.", "I work at a university. I can confirm it is taken very seriously and the plagiarism cases I dealt with resulted in a failure of the module and having to resubmit and be capped. And that was a minor plagiarism offence. Being kicked off the programme is a distinct possibility. There are courses on the virtual learning environment to teach students what plagiarism is because it was becoming a regular occurrence, probably due to parents like his mum.\n\nTaking a hard line now is the best way.

They get a semester 1 grade and a semester 2 grade. We start anew in January. And hopefully they figure out they actually have to do the homework and take the exams.", "There are a lot of universities that ask about any incidents of academic dishonesty in high school.", "So OP should negotiate for the opportunity for his son to actually do the project even though he had that exact opportunity already?

I was very much not cheating.  Of course, my regular in-class work was on the same grammatical level, so it wouldn't have been surprising to my teachers when I turned in relatively polished essays.

No. Typically most have the you automatically fail the class. Any more times is typically you go on academic probation if they have an option for that depending on the school, if not afterwards it's typically you get kicked out. \n\nAs the typical A/B student in high school, I got 2 Ds from difficult classes.
