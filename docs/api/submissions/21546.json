What are their thoughts?", "I don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t tell your partner why you told the person to leave. You\u2019re NTA for doing so, but there is no shame in not wanting to be in the company of an abuser who tormented you.", "It\u2019s hard to say for sure without understanding the extent of the bullying 40 years ago, but assuming your immediate reaction and erring on the side of caution, NTA. Your partner\u2019s friend didn\u2019t ask if they could bring a guest, certainly not one that your other friends are uncomfortable with, and you weren\u2019t rude in how you went about it.", "NTA\u2026 you stood for your long time friend and made sure he was in a safe environment. Yes you should have explain to your partner beforehand but that depends how she would reach since u said the person that Brought the guy was more her friend.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nYou should have talked to your partner first. You just kicked them out without giving any actual reason? You may lose more friends.", "Yta. You have no idea what happened. 20 plus years ago. I think you need more than what you have to kick him out. No one is the same person 20 years later.  I\u2019d hate to be judged on something I did in high school", "NTA - mostly because you handled this discreetly. Personally, I would have maybe found out a little more etc. as its possible asking them to leave would possible have made it more uncomfortable for your friend who was bullied by calling attention to it. But I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH.", "YTA, and this doesn't even seem close to being real. \n\nYou are supposedly in your forties and have an active social life. Folks in this age range can navigate their own lives, even when someone, who was an asshole 25 or thirty years before, attends the same party. \n\nI know for many people mentioning the word bully, in any context, elicits an automatic nta and cries of trauma... but come on, man... high school was decades ago.\n\nPeople need to learn to cope with the real world, even when it is unpleasant.", "Guest ain't paying the mortgage they can gtfo lol", "This is iffy, but I kinda think YTA. Like you said you\u2019re all in your 40so said bullying happened 20+ years ago. The said guest didn\u2019t give any indication of being disruptive plus you didn\u2019t even speak to your partner about this situation. You\u2019re impulsive and may have made irreparable damages in friendships.", "YTA, so it's true you don't have to have anyone in your house that you don't want but events that happened 30 years prior that almost certainly have more than one take on it makes your response to instantly kick this person out extreme. The fact that you didn't even talk to your partner just doubles your TA standing.", "YTA \u2013 I would be pissed if my partner unilaterally kicked one of my friends out of our shared home, unless there was a damn good reason why they had to do it immediately. I can\u2019t see why what you did couldn\u2019t wait a short while, to speak to her first.\n\nI\u2019m curious why you\u2019re \u201c*a little disappointed*\u201d in your girlfriend\u2019s friend. I wonder if it\u2019s linked to the fact that you \u201c*expect the ones we know to bring people of good character*\u201d. But you say you\u2019re all 40-ish.\n\nDo you expect your friends to conduct rigorous interviews backed by forensic profiling, psychiatric testing, and background checks that would put the US intelligence agencies to shame before they accept someone as a friend?\n\nI mean, to put it bluntly, you seem to expect your friends to magically uncover whether any of their friends was a childhood bully over two decades ago, that they may shield you from such villains. You said the ex-bully \u201c*seemed pretty nice and was polite enough*\u201d, so your miscreant detector apparently failed you.\n\nPeople can be quite shitty in high school. But people in high school are children, and civilised societies don\u2019t hold children to the same standard as adults. An awful lot can change in twenty years. If you are so outraged over unspecified childhood bullying, I shudder to imagine your attitude to ex-convicts.", "NTA, the person was a stranger in your home.

My partner was sympathetic and understanding about it. Sorry, I didn't make that clear in post. I asked her not to blow up the friend, which she agreed. \n\nI guess they were a newish friend, which is why she didn't put up a huge fight with the person brought. And I'm not sure I really didn't pry. I'm not really gonna ask someone to explain bullying done many years ago, but you know if it makes my friend of 20+ years more comfortable over a stranger, in a moments reaction it felt like right thing to do.

That wasn't the issue. \n\nAnd the person who brought the \"bully\" was more their partner's friend. Who is still probably wondering why they were kicked out.", "That's fair. I was kinda in protection mode for my friend.", "That's true, I didn't really think about that. I was very discrete and they didn't make a scene.

But, if you want to save yourself some grief in the future, saying things like \"they had to leave unexpectedly\" and \"past events made the current situation untenable, so I had to make a judgement call\" will fend off the curious people and make the nosy ones look boorish for pressing further, while still allowing the people at the center of the issue to save face.", "OP said in another comment their partner was understanding after the fact, and even if I had a general open door policy, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019d enforce it at the cost of someone I\u2019m closer to\u2019s comfort.", "I'm amazed that the bully didn't try to give you a wedgie...", "True", "But it wasn\u2019t your battle to fight, even if it was your party.

They were bullied over 20 years ago ( yes, I understand that can cause trauma and have lasting effects) but as an adult, I remove MYSELF, from situations and people that make me uncomfortable. Other people are not responsible for my feelings. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason to ask someone who seemingly wasn\u2019t being rude or disruptive to leave, the person who is uncomfortable can leave and say hey we\u2019ll catch up later.", "YTA.\n\nIf you have more or less an open house where guests are allowed to bring other guests without advanced clearance, then this person has become your guest.

If you can\u2019t be forgiven for childhood mistakes by 40 that\u2019s really sad. No one at 40 is who they were at 16. At least I would hope not. I guess the exception may be if someone was bullying someone by being homophobic, racist or otherwise bigoted and they held onto those prejudices, but OP didn\u2019t give any indication that was the case.", "It sounds like you've never had the misfortune to be bullied. I was in my teens, by girls I had thought were my friends. It happened at the same time I lost my dear grandma, and I was left feeling alone and had suicidal thoughts. It also led to an eating disorder that took up almost 10 years of my life. Now it was a long time ago, I'm in my 30s, but no matter how much any of those girls have changed (thankfully I don't know as I didn't accept their friend requests on social media) I would not want to be in the same room as them.

Thank you for standing up for your friend", "NTA - first and foremost because you don\u2019t even need a reason to ask someone who do not live there to get out of your house. \n\nYou handled the situation quite gracefully. You didn\u2019t went public, there was no drama, no fuss, no unfairness. \n\nThe ones saying it would have been polite to no act upon your friend discomfort, when they voiced it to you -privately nonetheless, are basically saying you have less right in your own home than a guest -you didn\u2019t even invited to beginning with. This is ridiculous. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how long ago the arm was done. It doesn\u2019t matter if the perpetrator have changed. The victim have every right to still not be comfortable being around the one who bullied them.

I mean damn, likely before the adoption of DVD.\n\nWhat an incredibly self righteous and absurd thing to do.", "Girl, YTA in this situation, and let me break it down for you. I totally understand wanting a chill vibe at your housewarming party, but the way you handled things was not cool.\n\nFirst off, you didn't even bother discussing it with your partner before kicking the guest out. When you're hosting together, decisions should be made as a team. By making a solo move, you disrespected your partner and disregarded their friendship with the guest.\n\nSecondly, you acted on hearsay without solid evidence. I get it, your friend spilled the tea about the guest being a bully back in high school. But come on, that was ages ago, and people can change. You can't just assume someone is still the same mean girl they were in their teens. Without concrete proof or personal experiences, it's unfair to judge someone solely based on old gossip.\n\nAnd let's talk about the secrecy. You decided to keep the reason behind the guest's departure a mystery, even from your partner. Look, I get that you want to protect your friend's privacy, but relationships thrive on trust and open communication. Keeping important info from your partner only breeds doubt and tension.", "YTA. You really jumped to a conclusion on this without truly knowing the story. This was an overreaction. Plus this was your partner\u2019s friend, not yours. You had no business deciding this on your own and damaging his friendship.", "NTA", "NTA.  Bullies never deserve sympathy, consideration, explanations, kindness, or anything similar.", "Honestly NTA, others may disagree but I think this was great of you. \n\nA girl in high school that had bullied me for years eventually orchestrated a whole mess of a situation that traumatized me and all my friends stayed friends with her, so I have to see her and be around her and socialize with her every time any of my friends have a major life event (we've both been bridesmaids at two weddings so far for example) and it's really uncomfortable and hard for me to deal with but I don't want to be left out of everything because of her either...so kudos to you for not making your friend deal with that, I would feel very loved in their shoes.", "NTA.  But I'd like to think that you told the prior school bully exactly why they were being kicked out, solely to give them something to reflect on.  Your party is 100% not the time for them to realise that they wronged someone else, and to have a chance to apologize for it.\n\nI've been approached by people who bullied me at school, and they wholeheartedly apologized for being assholes, which I accepted.  I've also apologized to people that I bullied and had it accepted, even though I'm still not sure I deserved it.", "NTA\n\nIf the AH who bullied me when we were 12 randomly showed up anywhere and I had the power to make him leave, you can bet the farm I would. Except I\u2019d be petty and tell the whole party what he did before kicking him out.", "Info: What was bullied friend\u2019s response when bully was ejected?", "NTA, your friend is more important than a stranger", "NTA, but you could have told your partner in a separate room or text him so that he knows what's going on.\n\nBut good for you, you're a good friend.", "Thank you for saying this. I'm not saying people need to get over their trauma, but holding grudges and expecting everyone to accommodate their grudges is petty. And they are they bullies they once hated.", "So the bully gets to win yet again? The friend should leave while the bully gets to stay?", "You have no idea what happened. Being bullied isn\u2019t something one gets over easily.", "There was a girl who used to torment me constantly when I was a child. She had a sister who was very nice when she wasn't around the bully. \n\n Fast forward to adulthood and I was back in my hometown attending a party at the house of the nicer sister with my new boyfriend (now my husband). I knew that the bully would be there but it was a long time ago and I was told that she had changed and was now very respectable.  She walked over to me and said she remembered me, then called me by the cruel childhood nickname she had given me all those years ago. In front of my boyfriend. I just smiled and said, \"Sarah, you haven't changed a bit\". The bully took this as a compliment, LOL. \n\nI don't believe that people change their basic personalities from the age of 3. Mean children grow up into mean adults. Some are just better at covering it than others.", "I was bullied intensly. It was also by former friends but also by a bunch of other people. It wasn't just words. It was also physical.\n\nBasically, I was being attacked verbally and physically. I fought back but, when the numbers are against you, things aren't going to go your way.\n\nFor context, this also happened when my home life was at its most chaotic. My parents were both emotionally and physically abusive. \n\nIn short, I had no port in the storm.", "I have never been a bully, but I was bullied.\n\nMy closest friend turned on me and actively bullied the hell out of me. At the same time, other students (largely older) did the same.\n\nIt was verbal bullying but also physical bullying.\n\nI was attacked by groups of older students in the hallways, on the way home or wherever they could find me.\n\nI fought back, but numbers matter and one on 3 or 4 just isn't a fair fight. (Not that there is such a thing)\n\nAt the same time, my emotionally and physically abusive home was at its most chaotic. \n\nI had no refuge. My home was violent, unsafe and poisonous. The world beyond it was much the same.", "I didn\u2019t expect t this to be a popular opinion, but yea If I still have an issue with someone after 20 years\u2026 I\u2019m discreetly leaving the situation, and will explain to the host on a later date. It\u2019s not about them \u201cwinning\u201d anything, as a guest I don\u2019t get to tell people who can and can\u2019t be in their home, that\u2019s entitled AF", "But OP didn\u2019t blame the person?\n\nShe said she was apologetic, \u201cwe don\u2019t know you and you\u2019re making another guest uncomfortable, I\u2019m sorry but please leave\u201d doesn\u2019t involve a lot of blame - it doesn\u2019t sound like she was trying to be impolite or start a fight - but there\u2019s a lot that usually goes unsaid.\n\nEg. that the person is probably shitty for being a bully in the first place, that the friends taste in men is disappointing.\n\nIt\u2019s like, middle aged men often say or do inappropriate things at my office, they\u2019re to blame for their actions, peoples opinions of them are often lowered, but the polite thing to do is pretend to laugh it off in the moment. \n\nWhy start a fight and insist on explaining blame and problematic behaviours to an adult, when walking away from undesirable people is so much easier?", "Lol. You think people are the same from when they were 3?", "Yeeee.. i don't believe you. If you were you wouldnt defend bullies. Placing the blame on the victim is what the bully does, which you did in your initial comment.\n\nNo way i'd ever break bread with some of my bullies and high school was 14 years ago for me.", "He did ask her to ask the person leave, just let her know the situation.  Maybe he did that so if he stayed but didn't seem like he was having fun she would know why.  There is no way in hell I am letting a bully stay if one of my friends tells me they are uncomfortable."]}
