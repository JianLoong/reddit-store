NTA.\n\nYWBTA if you don't explain in more detail to your partner. They have the right to know the basic details of why someone has been removed from a party they are co-hosting in their own home. They also might want to adjust their friendships with the relevant parties based on this info.\n\nHave you heard from the friend who brought the offender? Do they know about this history? What are their thoughts?", "I don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t tell your partner why you told the person to leave. You\u2019re NTA for doing so, but there is no shame in not wanting to be in the company of an abuser who tormented you.", "It\u2019s hard to say for sure without understanding the extent of the bullying 40 years ago, but assuming your immediate reaction and erring on the side of caution, NTA. Your partner\u2019s friend didn\u2019t ask if they could bring a guest, certainly not one that your other friends are uncomfortable with, and you weren\u2019t rude in how you went about it.", "NTA\u2026 you stood for your long time friend and made sure he was in a safe environment. Yes you should have explain to your partner beforehand but that depends how she would reach since u said the person that Brought the guy was more her friend.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nYou should have talked to your partner first. You just kicked them out without giving any actual reason? You may lose more friends.", "Yta. You have no idea what happened. 20 plus years ago. I think you need more than what you have to kick him out. No one is the same person 20 years later.  I\u2019d hate to be judged on something I did in high school", "NTA - mostly because you handled this discreetly. Personally, I would have maybe found out a little more etc. as its possible asking them to leave would possible have made it more uncomfortable for your friend who was bullied by calling attention to it. But I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH.", "YTA, and this doesn't even seem close to being real. \n\nYou are supposedly in your forties and have an active social life. Folks in this age range can navigate their own lives, even when someone, who was an asshole 25 or thirty years before, attends the same party. \n\nI know for many people mentioning the word bully, in any context, elicits an automatic nta and cries of trauma... but come on, man... high school was decades ago.\n\nPeople need to learn to cope with the real world, even when it is unpleasant.", "Guest ain't paying the mortgage they can gtfo lol", "This is iffy, but I kinda think YTA. Like you said you\u2019re all in your 40so said bullying happened 20+ years ago. The said guest didn\u2019t give any indication of being disruptive plus you didn\u2019t even speak to your partner about this situation. You\u2019re impulsive and may have made irreparable damages in friendships.", "YTA, so it's true you don't have to have anyone in your house that you don't want but events that happened 30 years prior that almost certainly have more than one take on it makes your response to instantly kick this person out extreme. The fact that you didn't even talk to your partner just doubles your TA standing.", "YTA \u2013 I would be pissed if my partner unilaterally kicked one of my friends out of our shared home, unless there was a damn good reason why they had to do it immediately. I can\u2019t see why what you did couldn\u2019t wait a short while, to speak to her first.\n\nI\u2019m curious why you\u2019re \u201c*a little disappointed*\u201d in your girlfriend\u2019s friend. I wonder if it\u2019s linked to the fact that you \u201c*expect the ones we know to bring people of good character*\u201d. But you say you\u2019re all 40-ish.\n\nDo you expect your friends to conduct rigorous interviews backed by forensic profiling, psychiatric testing, and background checks that would put the US intelligence agencies to shame before they accept someone as a friend?\n\nI mean, to put it bluntly, you seem to expect your friends to magically uncover whether any of their friends was a childhood bully over two decades ago, that they may shield you from such villains. You said the ex-bully \u201c*seemed pretty nice and was polite enough*\u201d, so your miscreant detector apparently failed you.\n\nPeople can be quite shitty in high school. But people in high school are children, and civilised societies don\u2019t hold children to the same standard as adults. An awful lot can change in twenty years. If you are so outraged over unspecified childhood bullying, I shudder to imagine your attitude to ex-convicts.", "NTA, the person was a stranger in your home.  Be bullied and the trauma of it can last forever.   The bully was unhappy about being told to leave shows he could care less about what he did.  He did not say he was sorry, or he understood.  Once a bully always a bully.", "YTA.", "To be clear I was in no way blaming the person who Brough them and did not give them any crap, I was actually apologetic to them specifically and let them know they didn't have to leave, but I mean who's not gonna leave w person they brought.", "They know, I told my partner when everyone left. My partner was sympathetic and understanding about it. Sorry, I didn't make that clear in post. I asked her not to blow up the friend, which she agreed. \n\nI guess they were a newish friend, which is why she didn't put up a huge fight with the person brought. And I'm not sure I really didn't pry. I'm not really gonna ask someone to explain bullying done many years ago, but you know if it makes my friend of 20+ years more comfortable over a stranger, in a moments reaction it felt like right thing to do. Not disputing being an asshole, persay, just explaining reaction. To give context the friend of mine is like a brother in my mind my home is his home.", "Well, I've known the person who was bullied for 20+ years and if they said it was bad I believe them.", "OP implies it's no big deal for them when a friend brings a friend. That wasn't the issue. \n\nAnd the person who brought the \"bully\" was more their partner's friend. Who is still probably wondering why they were kicked out.", "That's fair. I was kinda in protection mode for my friend.", "That's true, I didn't really think about that. I was very discrete and they didn't make a scene. Our place has a few entrances out to the drive way so they left through kitchen door no one really noticed by my partner and my friend. He seemed relieved, but you're right.", "I understand your point of view. Not any justification or dispute of your judgement, but some people for their whole lives are sensitive and deal with lasting trauma that doesn't make it easy to deal with issues some of us are able to with ease.", "No one needs to be around someone they dont want to or have someone in their house they dont want.", "idk pal i was stalked by an older classmate in high school, and while it was ten years ago and i almost never think about high school itself, i would absolutely be upset if i saw this person at a social gathering. and i would hope i felt comfortable enough to tell the host, my very close friend, that it\u2019s an issue. if it wasn\u2019t my closest friends i was with, i would remove myself. \ntrauma is permanent and lives in the body. you cannot control your initial reaction, only how you handle it. i think the friend did a great thing by just privately confiding their feelings with the host, their friend. \nthe host 100% has the choice to remove anyone from their home for any reason at any time. \nops is NTA", "Lol, I like you.", "Dude, read your own post:\n\n\"*we would expect the ones we know to bring people of good character*\"\n\n\"*one of our friends, who I have to say I'm a little disappointed in*\"\n\nWhat exactly do you expect reddit to infer from that?", "Did the bully even try to apologize for his past actions?", "Well, you don't owe anyone an explanation for who you eject from your home or why. But, if you want to save yourself some grief in the future, saying things like \"they had to leave unexpectedly\" and \"past events made the current situation untenable, so I had to make a judgement call\" will fend off the curious people and make the nosy ones look boorish for pressing further, while still allowing the people at the center of the issue to save face.", "OP said in another comment their partner was understanding after the fact, and even if I had a general open door policy, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019d enforce it at the cost of someone I\u2019m closer to\u2019s comfort.", "I'm amazed that the bully didn't try to give you a wedgie...", "True", "But it wasn\u2019t your battle to fight, even if it was your party. Your friend is old enough to be responsible for themself, and should have either removed themself from the situation, confronted the other person, or frankly just ignored them for an evening.  You\u2019re in your 40s! Putting yourself in the middle is what makes YTA.", "On a real note it sucks your buddy and the bully could work it out but shit happens and we don't know the trauma from it.", "exactly and how was the guest that brought the friend to know about his past from decades back?", "That's fair and good advice.", "Thanks, I take care of my friends.", "Yep! I said that in my judgement comment below. Totally understand OP sticking up for his friend, but the knee-jerk reaction, judgemental attitude to the stranger *and* to his wife's friend in his post, and then trying to deny it?! C'mon.", "exactamondo!", "He didn't even know why he was asked to leave other than he made someone uncomfortable with his presence.", "I feel like your friend is  the asshole. They were bullied over 20 years ago ( yes, I understand that can cause trauma and have lasting effects) but as an adult, I remove MYSELF, from situations and people that make me uncomfortable. Other people are not responsible for my feelings. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason to ask someone who seemingly wasn\u2019t being rude or disruptive to leave, the person who is uncomfortable can leave and say hey we\u2019ll catch up later.", "YTA.\n\nIf you have more or less an open house where guests are allowed to bring other guests without advanced clearance, then this person has become your guest. You ejected the guest not based on what the guest was doing now, not based on what you thought that the guest might do in the future, but based on an accusation of what the guest allegedly did over 20 years in the past.", "YTA", "NTA, but it was 40 years ago, a shame your friend couldn\u2019t just suck it up for a couple hours and move on.", "Definitely. If you can\u2019t be forgiven for childhood mistakes by 40 that\u2019s really sad. No one at 40 is who they were at 16. At least I would hope not. I guess the exception may be if someone was bullying someone by being homophobic, racist or otherwise bigoted and they held onto those prejudices, but OP didn\u2019t give any indication that was the case.", "It sounds like you've never had the misfortune to be bullied. I was in my teens, by girls I had thought were my friends. It happened at the same time I lost my dear grandma, and I was left feeling alone and had suicidal thoughts. It also led to an eating disorder that took up almost 10 years of my life. Now it was a long time ago, I'm in my 30s, but no matter how much any of those girls have changed (thankfully I don't know as I didn't accept their friend requests on social media) I would not want to be in the same room as them. They almost killed me, and they changed the confident, happy go lucky kid I once was. If OP had done this for me, I would be grateful.", "Found the active or former bully", ">could care less\n\ncouldn't care less. 'I couldn't care less about what I did.'", ">To be clear I was in no way blaming the person who Brough them\n\nLiar. \n\n>Anyway, one of our friends, who I have to say I'm a little disappointed in, brought a guy we'd never met. \n\nYou come across as so self righteous."]}
