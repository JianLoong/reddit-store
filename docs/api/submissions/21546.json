I\u2019d hate to be judged on something I did in high school", "NTA - mostly because you handled this discreetly.

The fact that you didn't even talk to your partner just doubles your TA standing.", "YTA \u2013 I would be pissed if my partner unilaterally kicked one of my friends out of our shared home, unless there was a damn good reason why they had to do it immediately.

But you say you\u2019re all 40-ish.\n\nDo you expect your friends to conduct rigorous interviews backed by forensic profiling, psychiatric testing, and background checks that would put the US intelligence agencies to shame before they accept someone as a friend?\n\nI mean, to put it bluntly, you seem to expect your friends to magically uncover whether any of their friends was a childhood bully over two decades ago, that they may shield you from such villains. You said the ex-bully \u201c*seemed pretty nice and was polite enough*\u201d, so your miscreant detector apparently failed you.\n\nPeople can be quite shitty in high school. But people in high school are children, and civilised societies don\u2019t hold children to the same standard as adults. An awful lot can change in twenty years. If you are so outraged over unspecified childhood bullying, I shudder to imagine your attitude to ex-convicts.", "NTA, the person was a stranger in your home.

I mean damn, likely before the adoption of DVD.\n\nWhat an incredibly self righteous and absurd thing to do.", "Girl, YTA in this situation, and let me break it down for you. I totally understand wanting a chill vibe at your housewarming party, but the way you handled things was not cool.\n\nFirst off, you didn't even bother discussing it with your partner before kicking the guest out. When you're hosting together, decisions should be made as a team. By making a solo move, you disrespected your partner and disregarded their friendship with the guest.\n\nSecondly, you acted on hearsay without solid evidence. I get it, your friend spilled the tea about the guest being a bully back in high school. But come on, that was ages ago, and people can change. You can't just assume someone is still the same mean girl they were in their teens. Without concrete proof or personal experiences, it's unfair to judge someone solely based on old gossip.\n\nAnd let's talk about the secrecy. You decided to keep the reason behind the guest's departure a mystery, even from your partner. Look, I get that you want to protect your friend's privacy, but relationships thrive on trust and open communication. Keeping important info from your partner only breeds doubt and tension.", "YTA. You really jumped to a conclusion on this without truly knowing the story. This was an overreaction. Plus this was your partner\u2019s friend, not yours. You had no business deciding this on your own and damaging his friendship.", "NTA", "NTA.  Bullies never deserve sympathy, consideration, explanations, kindness, or anything similar.", "Honestly NTA, others may disagree but I think this was great of you. \n\nA girl in high school that had bullied me for years eventually orchestrated a whole mess of a situation that traumatized me and all my friends stayed friends with her, so I have to see her and be around her and socialize with her every time any of my friends have a major life event (we've both been bridesmaids at two weddings so far for example) and it's really uncomfortable and hard for me to deal with but I don't want to be left out of everything because of her either...so kudos to you for not making your friend deal with that, I would feel very loved in their shoes.", "NTA.  But I'd like to think that you told the prior school bully exactly why they were being kicked out, solely to give them something to reflect on.  Your party is 100% not the time for them to realise that they wronged someone else, and to have a chance to apologize for it.\n\nI've been approached by people who bullied me at school, and they wholeheartedly apologized for being assholes, which I accepted.  I've also apologized to people that I bullied and had it accepted, even though I'm still not sure I deserved it.", "NTA\n\nIf the AH who bullied me when we were 12 randomly showed up anywhere and I had the power to make him leave, you can bet the farm I would. Except I\u2019d be petty and tell the whole party what he did before kicking him out.", "Info: What was bullied friend\u2019s response when bully was ejected?", "NTA, your friend is more important than a stranger", "NTA, but you could have told your partner in a separate room or text him so that he knows what's going on.\n\nBut good for you, you're a good friend.", "Thank you for saying this. I'm not saying people need to get over their trauma, but holding grudges and expecting everyone to accommodate their grudges is petty. And they are they bullies they once hated.", "So the bully gets to win yet again? The friend should leave while the bully gets to stay?", "You have no idea what happened. Being bullied isn\u2019t something one gets over easily.", "There was a girl who used to torment me constantly when I was a child. She had a sister who was very nice when she wasn't around the bully. \n\n Fast forward to adulthood and I was back in my hometown attending a party at the house of the nicer sister with my new boyfriend (now my husband). I knew that the bully would be there but it was a long time ago and I was told that she had changed and was now very respectable.  She walked over to me and said she remembered me, then called me by the cruel childhood nickname she had given me all those years ago. In front of my boyfriend. I just smiled and said, \"Sarah, you haven't changed a bit\". The bully took this as a compliment, LOL. \n\nI don't believe that people change their basic personalities from the age of 3. Mean children grow up into mean adults. Some are just better at covering it than others.", "I was bullied intensly. It was also by former friends but also by a bunch of other people. It wasn't just words. It was also physical.\n\nBasically, I was being attacked verbally and physically. I fought back but, when the numbers are against you, things aren't going to go your way.\n\nFor context, this also happened when my home life was at its most chaotic. My parents were both emotionally and physically abusive. \n\nIn short, I had no port in the storm.", "I have never been a bully, but I was bullied.\n\nMy closest friend turned on me and actively bullied the hell out of me. At the same time, other students (largely older) did the same.\n\nIt was verbal bullying but also physical bullying.\n\nI was attacked by groups of older students in the hallways, on the way home or wherever they could find me.\n\nI fought back, but numbers matter and one on 3 or 4 just isn't a fair fight. (Not that there is such a thing)\n\nAt the same time, my emotionally and physically abusive home was at its most chaotic. \n\nI had no refuge. My home was violent, unsafe and poisonous. The world beyond it was much the same.", "I didn\u2019t expect t this to be a popular opinion, but yea If I still have an issue with someone after 20 years\u2026 I\u2019m discreetly leaving the situation, and will explain to the host on a later date. It\u2019s not about them \u201cwinning\u201d anything, as a guest I don\u2019t get to tell people who can and can\u2019t be in their home, that\u2019s entitled AF", "But OP didn\u2019t blame the person?\n\nShe said she was apologetic, \u201cwe don\u2019t know you and you\u2019re making another guest uncomfortable, I\u2019m sorry but please leave\u201d doesn\u2019t involve a lot of blame - it doesn\u2019t sound like she was trying to be impolite or start a fight - but there\u2019s a lot that usually goes unsaid.\n\nEg. that the person is probably shitty for being a bully in the first place, that the friends taste in men is disappointing.\n\nIt\u2019s like, middle aged men often say or do inappropriate things at my office, they\u2019re to blame for their actions, peoples opinions of them are often lowered, but the polite thing to do is pretend to laugh it off in the moment. \n\nWhy start a fight and insist on explaining blame and problematic behaviours to an adult, when walking away from undesirable people is so much easier?", "Lol. You think people are the same from when they were 3?", "Yeeee.. i don't believe you. If you were you wouldnt defend bullies. Placing the blame on the victim is what the bully does, which you did in your initial comment.\n\nNo way i'd ever break bread with some of my bullies and high school was 14 years ago for me.", "He did ask her to ask the person leave, just let her know the situation.  Maybe he did that so if he stayed but didn't seem like he was having fun she would know why.  There is no way in hell I am letting a bully stay if one of my friends tells me they are uncomfortable.", "NTA you\u2019re a good host. Why is your husbands friend who brought someone you didn\u2019t know more important than the other guest? You were discreet. Handled the best way you could. And it\u2019s your home too. Just because others would have handled it differently does not make you wrong. It\u2019s your home. It was your decision. That other friend told you.", "What a difficult situation. I think you handled it beautifully. NAH.\n\nETA: I saw my bully at a high school reunion and she was losing her hair. I thought to myself \u201coh, my curse DID work, it just took a lot longer.\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "NTA\n\nIn my opinion you're likely to get a big thank you. I love the way you stick with your friends, really nice to see. Keep it up.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. You stood up for your friend and that's commendable. The bully is a stranger to you and you don't \"owe\" him anything.", "NTA, but I definitely would have had a private conversation with my partner FIRST so they were in the loop.\nThat's a very important step in a shared home.", "NTA but you should have told your partner first. Also it was neither the time nor the place to go into details of the abusive behaviour your friend experienced. \n\nYou said in other comments you have known your close friend, who was bullied, for decades; imo that\u2019s enough time for you to make a judgement call about the comfort of your friend against someone you just met and don\u2019t know.\n\nAs for the bully, sure it was 20 years ago, but actions have consequences, and abusive behaviour can affect people for years.", "YTA, as honestly, you sound like a bully and just plain mean. \n\nSomeone came to your party that you did not know, and that pissed you off. Let's face it,from \"I'm a little disappointed\" to \"I don't even know you,\" it is clear that you wanted your perfect housewarming party, and this \"stranger\" was impeding on that. \n\nIn addition, it seems like you have a very inflated opinion of yourself-\"good character,\" \"pride myself on,\" \"didn't like\"-that does not seem to be based in reality. . You engaged in gossip, which may or not have been true. How do you know your friend was actually bullied? Did you ever see your friend get bullied by this person? What if your friend was just competitive with the person, or is jealous of them, or a host of other things? It really speaks volumes that they are trying to get this person kicked out, but want to keep why all hush hush, but the person who was kicked out is gracious, leaving quietly. Both of you could learn about character from him. \n\nTo make it worse, you did not tell your partner what happened, and you want everyone to \"trust it was for the best.\" Gosh, you sound insufferable. Just because you think you are a wonderful person,with absolutely no reason to, does not mean everyone else has to indulge you. That is lame that your \"friend\" put you in this position to keep secrets from your partner, and I doubt more and more they were bullied. Expect less guests at your gatherings going forward, as people do not like mean girls and boys, and being petty and immature is not cute at any age.", "NAH. If your guest is uncomfortable and closer with them it makes sense. Unless the bully in question did some heinous shit, I think it\u2019s a little silly to be so worked up by seeing a high school bully, but whatever. I\u2019m not going to make assumptions there. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t really think you have the right to be disappointed in your friend. This person was a bully 20+ years ago. I don\u2019t know what happened, or what this person did, but it was over twenty years ago. How is your friend expected to know that when their friend was a teenager he was a dick? We don\u2019t know anything about what this dude did, and he could have simply grown into a kind and respectful person. Again\u202620+ years ago. \n\nI think you handled this very poorly. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole by any means, but you should have spoken to your partner about it first.", "YTA", "ESH... i get wanting everyone to feel comfortable... but also like... HOW many years ago was this? Sorry but maybe that person needs to speak to a professional... people can change and grow. At almost 40 you think adults would be better about keeping the peace.... talk it out... apologize... etc...", "YTA. You should have discussed the situation with your significant other first, seeing as how the person you were telling to leave was more their friend. \nAnd just because someone was a d!ck in high school doesn't really say anything about how they are as a person 25 + years later. Kicking him out when he wasn't actually doing anything to warrant it seems ridiculous.", "YTA. Unless he did something there was absolutely no reason for what you did.", "YTA. How ridiculous.", "So you made a one side decision, and not only didn\u2019t talk to your partner you also didn\u2019t address with your friend who brought the person! And you call yourself a \u201cgood host\u201d?\nThere are many ways to deal with situations like that, clearly one would be behaving like an a** and ask the person to leave!", "All this over something that happened at least 20 years ago?  When are people going to grow up?  Seriously?", "You were and are the AH.\n\nIt was 20 plus years ago.\n\nPeople change and should be given a chance.\n\nYour \"bullied\" friend needs therapy if he or she is holding on to something that happened years ago.\n\nOr possibly this was his way to get revenge.\n\nHopefully, neither you nor your \"bullied\" friend will never need to be forgiven for something you did lost ago.", "I\u2019m on the fence. \n\nIt was 20 years ago. In your late 30s you\u2019re expected to have a little resilience about high school stuff, no? Enough to make it a couple of hours a a party? \n\nBut if it was heinous, something that could legitimately be described as persecution, where the victim suffered a life altering mental or physical harm - ie more than getting punched in the face, more than being occasionally mocked - then it would be cruel to have them in the same room.\n\nI don\u2019t know that OP had enough certainty to do a pretty socially extreme act, one that puts a target and a social odour on the kicked out guest, but I wasn\u2019t there", "YTA. This person was behaving kindly to everyone and shouldn't be judged today for probably the worst thing they ever did, 22 years or more prior. Grow up.", "I think you were wrong.  Your friend was bulled in school and now it's 20 years later.  People change.  Think perhaps you should  had just acknowledged your friends concern and kept a good eye on the bully to see if he was continuing with his past actions.  If he did that would have been the time to address it and  ask him to leave. You also should have talked with your partner so they were aware also and could also intervened if needed.  If your friend  was that upset they could have left the party and spoken to you about it later instead of putting you in this position.", "NTA and wow OP, you are an incredible support and advocate for your friends.\n\nIf more people in the world defended their loved ones with such strength and grace, the world would be a better place. Bravo.", "NTA. You are a good friend.", "NTA", "Nta you did the right thing, yes perfect world you should told your partner before hand but was your partner going to say no, they can stay?", "NTA you\u2019re a great host.", "True friends support each other.Aquaintances keep appearances. OP is a true friend.\nEdit: Typo.", "NTAH, but I think that we live in a world where we can make right the wrongs of our past if given an opportunity. I am sorry for your friend that was bullied and I would hope that if you had addressed it with the guest that maybe they could have made right their wrongs. Instead, you decided to keep the reason to yourself and missed the opportunity for the hurt to be healed and the wrong to be right. \n\nI do think you owe your partner's friend the opportunity to understand the reason without divulging names and you should have included your partner in the decision-making at the time and not later. You would have been irate with them if they did it to you.\n\nYou need to remember this is a partnership and things need to be discussed before reacting.", "It didnt happen 40 years ago, Op friends are all almost 40 in AGE. The bullying was roughly 20 years ago.", "I think if OPs friend is still uncomfortable about it they need to address the issue with therapy. To hold all the unpleasantness for 20+ years is unhealthy.", "Bullying can lead to suicide as it can be extreme abuse. I shudder to think how you would react to your child attempting suicide because they are bullied.", "Heck, my twenty year reunion was last year, and I saw my bully for the first time since graduation. We hugged it out and moved on.\n\nNot saying everyone has to do that, but we should be able to recognize thst people can grow up after high school, and the ones that don't should be pitied.", "I dunno. If my close friend of 20 years told me they were uncomfortable in my home because their assaulter just walked in the door, even if that attack happened decades ago, I\u2019d kick that person out, no questions asked. I\u2019m not going to let that stranger stay because my close friend was attacked, allegedly, years ago.", "It wasn't 40 years ago. She said they're all in their 40s now. It was around 20 yrs ago.", "Oh my bad but still, if it\u2019s bad enough 20 years later  to say something, OP did the right thing.", "You could have told your partner in a separate room or texted him to let him know what was going on.", "No one was getting bullied at 20 years old... More like about 25-30 years ago when they were around 10 or so. That's a long time to hold onto that trauma, so it seemingly wasn't trivial for the guest that was uncomfortable.", "That honestly really depends on how severe the bullying was. Sometimes even though it's labeled as bullying, it can tread on or even get to the level of abuse.", "From your response, it sounds like you were never badly bullied. I was, and it affected me for years. Now I'm pretty much over it, but that doesn't mean I want to spend time in a room with these people. I don't need therapy so that I can force myself to be in my abusers' presence. I already have to do that with my ex-husband because of my children, and no therapy is going to change how horrible that feels. I think OP handled it well, and I appreciate her standing by her friend.", "Agreed, people who still freak out over bullies 20 years later need help. I'm sorry you got bullied, but people are stupid in high school. Move on. IMO YTA OP.", "Yeah I kinda think that person holding onto this for 20 years says more about them than it does the bullying", "Actually the person who brought him shouldn't bring extra people who aren't invited by you in your house. For this NTA", "It depends on the suffering they put you through back then. Sometimes a bully is annoying, can make you sad or angry. And sometimes a bully can cause terror, anxiety and depression. The first ones can even be easily forgiven with time. But the second ones may represent a trauma no one wants to relive.", "What if the bullying ruined your life plans, drove you to attempt suicide or had their parents join in on the abuse too. People may change but that doesn't mean they deserve anything from you. \n\nBullying can be extreme abuse and others should not dismiss another's experience or pity them because they were victims of another.", "That honestly depends on how extreme the level of bullying was. Was it typical teenage bullying which can be forgiven, or if it's to the level of what can be considered abuse, no one has to forgive that.", "Who are you referring to? OP\u2019s friend neither had a grudge nor expected OP to accommodate their feelings. Friend just told OP that they felt really uncomfortable and the reason why. OP then took it upon themselves to make sure their friend was comfortable at their event.", "Cheap, unfounded speculation is bullying", "YTA both are correct for everyday speech.", "Still, not last week, people can change, never-mind over the course of 20 years. Maybe he\u2019s still a dick, but maybe he\u2019s not. At some point you need to stop letting the past ruin your present. And i say this as a kid who was beaten mercilessly for the first 15 years of my life.", "Eh, they're nearly 40 so more like 37-38ish, there are plenty of 17/18/19 year olds that experience bullying so 20 years is right", "I know. I was severely bullied, to the point where I thought suicide was the only way to escape it. But here I am, alive and thriving after moving past it. My bullies never apologized but they are different people now than they were when we were younger and I would not make them leave or cause a scene.", "I don't agree. I was bullied over 20 years ago. It was so bad it's a small miracle I'm here today. I have dealt with what happened and moved on, but I still wouldn't want to be in a room with any of the people involved. The fact their guest approached OP calmly and quietly isn't freaking out about it.", "No, that's what bullying does.", "And how would she know if the person wasn\u2019t of good character?  None of us are who we were back in high school.", "Exactly!!!", "What's the lie?", "You\u2019re going to hold someone to their 3 year old selves when they don\u2019t even know right from wrong yet? That\u2019s pretty rude. \n\nSarah is one person and you can\u2019t base all of humanity on one person. People change and grow every day and to think otherwise is pretty narrow minded and unhealthy. To be stuck in the past is to relive your trauma over and over and never move past it.", "Seriously this might be the dumbest thing I've read in a long time. Yeah, people change from 3 to adulthood. Believe it or not.", "[removed]", "I'm sorry to hear that. Being bullied sucks. I'm surprised you can't empathise with someone, even years later, being uncomfortable seeing their former tormentor at a party.", "I mean, the friend is the one who OP actually wanted at the party. The former bully was a stranger to OP. If my friend who I actually invited because I want to enjoy the evening with them comes up to me and tells me that a person who I did not invite who is a total stranger to me is making them uncomfortable and my friend is going to remove themselves from the situation and leave? That\u2019s not an acceptable outcome for me. If someone needs to leave the party, then it\u2019s not going to be my friend, whose presence I requested; it\u2019s going to be the stranger, who I did not invite in the first place.", "Absolutely not, unless everyday speech has seriously dumbed down. \n\nI could care less = I care a certain amount (say 10%). I could care less (9% and less) than I do right now. \n\nI could not care less = I care the least amount it is possible to care (0%, nothing at all). I could not care any less than I do right now. \n\nNo, both are not correct, only one is, and it is stupid to say otherwise.", "Not everyone is you, and not everyone reacts to bullying the way you did. Telling someone with psychological trauma to just \"get over it\" isn't helpful nor realistic advice. She defended her long-time friend and asked a stranger to leave. Her home, her rules.", "No. I was severely bullied in elementary and high school and I moved past it and I\u2019m at least 10 years younger than OPs friend. The friend needs therapy, it\u2019s not healthy to hold on to that unpleasantness.", "That should have been a clue.", "Yes, we are born with a certain temperament.  Aggressive children become aggressive adults. Some are able to turn that aggression into social acceptable careers. \n\nT*hat pattern of consistency begins around age 3, and perhaps even earlier, said Brent Donnellan, professor and chair of psychology at Michigan State University. When psychologists study children, they don't measure personality traits in the same way they do for adults. Instead, they look at temperament \u2014 the intensity of a person's reactions to the world. We come into the world with unique temperaments, and research suggests that our temperaments as children \u2014 for example, whether we're easy going or prone to temper tantrums, eager or more reluctant to approach strangers \u2014 correspond to adult personality traits. \"A shy 3-year-old acts a lot different from a shy 20-something. But there's an underlying core,\" Donnellan told Live Science.*", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Either way, typically grown adults are expected to deal with their own problems in social situations like this. If I was the friend who brought the guest, I would be pissed honestly.", "Where does it say they were forced to break bread lol the dude who go bullied wasn\u2019t forced to interact with former bully, never even had to be in the same room if they didn\u2019t want to be.", "Well that\u2019s you and your house, and that\u2019s fine. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You\u2019re right, her home, her rules. It is realistic advice, if something has ruled your emotions for that long, taken that deep a toll, you owe it to yourself to work through it. I understand not everyone is me, but if it was bullying from 20 years ago, essentially childhood bullying, and you\u2019re letting it affect you that much now, maybe take a breath and reevaluate. You avoided this person for 20 years, just aboid them at the party and chances are you wont see them for another 20.", "To be frank, this guy sounds like an idiot.", "And that\u2019s your prerogative, but it\u2019s also the risk you take when you bring someone along to someone else\u2019s house, especially someone who is a stranger to the host. Just because that stranger is *allowed* doesn\u2019t mean that their presence was *requested*. Tolerance of an uninvited guest\u2019s presence can be revoked at any time, and as the person who brought the uninvited guest, you\u2019re essentially vouching for them.", "Yes, he should work through it--maybe he's tried and hasn't been able to? Maybe the bullying was so damaging to his psyche that it'll take the rest of his life? Again, saying \"get over it\" \"breathe and reevaluate\" isn't useful or helpful. There's a lot of people carrying around a lot of heavy shit--their ability to deal with it (or lack thereof) isn't my judgement call to make, and it shouldn't be yours.", "This guy may sincerely regret his past actions, nobody ever gave him the chance to apologize or make good. Not that he\u2019s the victim here, but it was a long time ago, he may be a better person now.", "I just dont think we\u2019re going to see eye to eye on this, and im not looking to upset anyone. He was considerate for thinking of his friend, but it was an awkward situation."]}
