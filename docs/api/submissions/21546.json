You said the ex-bully \u201c*seemed pretty nice and was polite enough*\u201d, so your miscreant detector apparently failed you.\n\nPeople can be quite shitty in high school.

I totally understand wanting a chill vibe at your housewarming party, but the way you handled things was not cool.\n\nFirst off, you didn't even bother discussing it with your partner before kicking the guest out. When you're hosting together, decisions should be made as a team. By making a solo move, you disrespected your partner and disregarded their friendship with the guest.\n\nSecondly, you acted on hearsay without solid evidence. I get it, your friend spilled the tea about the guest being a bully back in high school. But come on, that was ages ago, and people can change. You can't just assume someone is still the same mean girl they were in their teens. Without concrete proof or personal experiences, it's unfair to judge someone solely based on old gossip.\n\nAnd let's talk about the secrecy. You decided to keep the reason behind the guest's departure a mystery, even from your partner. Look, I get that you want to protect your friend's privacy, but relationships thrive on trust and open communication. Keeping important info from your partner only breeds doubt and tension.", "YTA. You really jumped to a conclusion on this without truly knowing the story. This was an overreaction. Plus this was your partner\u2019s friend, not yours.

Bullies never deserve sympathy, consideration, explanations, kindness, or anything similar.", "Honestly NTA, others may disagree but I think this was great of you. \n\nA girl in high school that had bullied me for years eventually orchestrated a whole mess of a situation that traumatized me and all my friends stayed friends with her, so I have to see her and be around her and socialize with her every time any of my friends have a major life event (we've both been bridesmaids at two weddings so far for example) and it's really uncomfortable and hard for me to deal with but I don't want to be left out of everything because of her either...so kudos to you for not making your friend deal with that, I would feel very loved in their shoes.", "NTA.  But I'd like to think that you told the prior school bully exactly why they were being kicked out, solely to give them something to reflect on.  Your party is 100% not the time for them to realise that they wronged someone else, and to have a chance to apologize for it.\n\nI've been approached by people who bullied me at school, and they wholeheartedly apologized for being assholes, which I accepted.

I'm not saying people need to get over their trauma, but holding grudges and expecting everyone to accommodate their grudges is petty. And they are they bullies they once hated.", "So the bully gets to win yet again? The friend should leave while the bully gets to stay?", "You have no idea what happened. Being bullied isn\u2019t something one gets over easily.", "There was a girl who used to torment me constantly when I was a child. She had a sister who was very nice when she wasn't around the bully. \n\n Fast forward to adulthood and I was back in my hometown attending a party at the house of the nicer sister with my new boyfriend (now my husband). I knew that the bully would be there but it was a long time ago and I was told that she had changed and was now very respectable.  She walked over to me and said she remembered me, then called me by the cruel childhood nickname she had given me all those years ago. In front of my boyfriend. I just smiled and said, \"Sarah, you haven't changed a bit\". The bully took this as a compliment, LOL. \n\nI don't believe that people change their basic personalities from the age of 3. Mean children grow up into mean adults. Some are just better at covering it than others.", "I was bullied intensly. It was also by former friends but also by a bunch of other people. It wasn't just words. It was also physical.\n\nBasically, I was being attacked verbally and physically. I fought back but, when the numbers are against you, things aren't going to go your way.\n\nFor context, this also happened when my home life was at its most chaotic. My parents were both emotionally and physically abusive. \n\nIn short, I had no port in the storm.", "I have never been a bully, but I was bullied.\n\nMy closest friend turned on me and actively bullied the hell out of me. At the same time, other students (largely older) did the same.\n\nIt was verbal bullying but also physical bullying.\n\nI was attacked by groups of older students in the hallways, on the way home or wherever they could find me.\n\nI fought back, but numbers matter and one on 3 or 4 just isn't a fair fight. (Not that there is such a thing)\n\nAt the same time, my emotionally and physically abusive home was at its most chaotic. \n\nI had no refuge. My home was violent, unsafe and poisonous. The world beyond it was much the same.", "I didn\u2019t expect t this to be a popular opinion, but yea If I still have an issue with someone after 20 years\u2026 I\u2019m discreetly leaving the situation, and will explain to the host on a later date. It\u2019s not about them \u201cwinning\u201d anything, as a guest I don\u2019t get to tell people who can and can\u2019t be in their home, that\u2019s entitled AF", "But OP didn\u2019t blame the person?\n\nShe said she was apologetic, \u201cwe don\u2019t know you and you\u2019re making another guest uncomfortable, I\u2019m sorry but please leave\u201d doesn\u2019t involve a lot of blame - it doesn\u2019t sound like she was trying to be impolite or start a fight - but there\u2019s a lot that usually goes unsaid.\n\nEg. that the person is probably shitty for being a bully in the first place, that the friends taste in men is disappointing.\n\nIt\u2019s like, middle aged men often say or do inappropriate things at my office, they\u2019re to blame for their actions, peoples opinions of them are often lowered, but the polite thing to do is pretend to laugh it off in the moment. \n\nWhy start a fight and insist on explaining blame and problematic behaviours to an adult, when walking away from undesirable people is so much easier?", "Lol. You think people are the same from when they were 3?", "Yeeee.. i don't believe you. If you were you wouldnt defend bullies. Placing the blame on the victim is what the bully does, which you did in your initial comment.\n\nNo way i'd ever break bread with some of my bullies and high school was 14 years ago for me.", "He did ask her to ask the person leave, just let her know the situation.  Maybe he did that so if he stayed but didn't seem like he was having fun she would know why.  There is no way in hell I am letting a bully stay if one of my friends tells me they are uncomfortable.", "NTA you\u2019re a good host. Why is your husbands friend who brought someone you didn\u2019t know more important than the other guest? You were discreet. Handled the best way you could. And it\u2019s your home too. Just because others would have handled it differently does not make you wrong. It\u2019s your home. It was your decision. That other friend told you.", "What a difficult situation. I think you handled it beautifully. NAH.\n\nETA: I saw my bully at a high school reunion and she was losing her hair.

The bully is a stranger to you and you don't \"owe\" him anything.", "NTA, but I definitely would have had a private conversation with my partner FIRST so they were in the loop.\nThat's a very important step in a shared home.", "NTA but you should have told your partner first. Also it was neither the time nor the place to go into details of the abusive behaviour your friend experienced. \n\nYou said in other comments you have known your close friend, who was bullied, for decades; imo that\u2019s enough time for you to make a judgement call about the comfort of your friend against someone you just met and don\u2019t know.\n\nAs for the bully, sure it was 20 years ago, but actions have consequences, and abusive behaviour can affect people for years.", "YTA, as honestly, you sound like a bully and just plain mean. \n\nSomeone came to your party that you did not know, and that pissed you off. Let's face it,from \"I'm a little disappointed\" to \"I don't even know you,\" it is clear that you wanted your perfect housewarming party, and this \"stranger\" was impeding on that. \n\nIn addition, it seems like you have a very inflated opinion of yourself-\"good character,\" \"pride myself on,\" \"didn't like\"-that does not seem to be based in reality. . You engaged in gossip, which may or not have been true. How do you know your friend was actually bullied? Did you ever see your friend get bullied by this person? What if your friend was just competitive with the person, or is jealous of them, or a host of other things? It really speaks volumes that they are trying to get this person kicked out, but want to keep why all hush hush, but the person who was kicked out is gracious, leaving quietly. Both of you could learn about character from him. \n\nTo make it worse, you did not tell your partner what happened, and you want everyone to \"trust it was for the best.\" Gosh, you sound insufferable. Just because you think you are a wonderful person,with absolutely no reason to, does not mean everyone else has to indulge you. That is lame that your \"friend\" put you in this position to keep secrets from your partner, and I doubt more and more they were bullied. Expect less guests at your gatherings going forward, as people do not like mean girls and boys, and being petty and immature is not cute at any age.", "NAH. If your guest is uncomfortable and closer with them it makes sense. Unless the bully in question did some heinous shit, I think it\u2019s a little silly to be so worked up by seeing a high school bully, but whatever. I\u2019m not going to make assumptions there. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t really think you have the right to be disappointed in your friend. This person was a bully 20+ years ago. I don\u2019t know what happened, or what this person did, but it was over twenty years ago. How is your friend expected to know that when their friend was a teenager he was a dick? We don\u2019t know anything about what this dude did, and he could have simply grown into a kind and respectful person. Again\u202620+ years ago. \n\nI think you handled this very poorly.

When psychologists study children, they don't measure personality traits in the same way they do for adults. Instead, they look at temperament \u2014 the intensity of a person's reactions to the world. We come into the world with unique temperaments, and research suggests that our temperaments as children \u2014 for example, whether we're easy going or prone to temper tantrums, eager or more reluctant to approach strangers \u2014 correspond to adult personality traits. \"A shy 3-year-old acts a lot different from a shy 20-something.

I understand you wanted to help/protect your friend but I think you acted a little too quickly on just some hearsay. It doesn\u2019t sound like you asked the \u201cbully\u201d his side; for all we know the \u201cvictim\u201d might be the actually bully and just wanted to inflict more damage to the guy\u2026 or maybe just didn\u2019t like them for whatever reason and made up a \u201cbully\u201d story to get them to leave. We don\u2019t know since the guy wasn\u2019t questioned. \n\nPlus it would be helpful to hear what the bullying consisted of. Was it innocent childhood playing around like name calling or flicking paper or something at your friend? Because that is something that kids do and should not really be considered bullying. If this guy physically beat up your friend then yes I can see that as bullying that might carry over to trauma decades later, but if not then silly child foolery should not leave emotional damage decades later. \n\nNot to mention that if your partner is close friends with this \u201cbully\u201d, then what does that say about your partner\u2019s character?", "YTA. Which I suspect will be an unpopular opinion, but there it is. And you\u2019re ick on so many different levels. \n\nFirst let\u2019s address the friend who was bullied: I\u2019ve spent the last 5 years in therapy over someone bullying me, but I will never want to be around that person again. Just saying, \u201cyou\u2019re acting like Terry\u201d is a curse in my house. But if I saw them at a party, I would not expect my host to toss them out.  I would tell the host that I was uncomfortable around that person and then I would leave. And that\u2019s if the person even made that ask. And that\u2019s not clear.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s talk about this moral fiber issue. My biggest ick. It comes across as sanctimonious and I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve posted your rules for moral fiber some where your friends can reference. Because that\u2019s different from one person to another. Also, people change over time, (at least most of us do) and a bully 20 years ago can be a totally different human now. That\u2019s especially the case for underage bullying. For all you know, they were also being bullied about something. Honestly, THEY aren\u2019t the ones who should be checking their moral fiber, you are.\n\nThird, you made an arbitrary decision that may impact your partner in a negative manner and you didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to talk to your partner before you asked them to leave. If you had the discretion to pull the two guests aside, you had the time to talk to your partner first. I could speculate on that, but I won\u2019t. It\u2019s not the behavior I expect from someone of good moral fiber\u2026just saying. You certainly owe all of them an apology.", "NTA. You're a good friend.

Such a bizarre reaction. And could have been embarrassing for the friend that confided in you. Pretty mortifying if the friend was saying, omg, that guy used to bully me in high school, and your reaction was to assume this person was still not over it, to the extent that they asked you to kick them out of the party?!
