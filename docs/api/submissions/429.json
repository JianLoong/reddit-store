Him having difficulties surrounding sleep might be true, just as you snoring and aggravating an existing problem might also be true. These are not two mutually exclusive things. But you can\u2019t really criticize him not having gone to see a doctor for his sleep issues if you haven\u2019t gone to see one about the snoring.", "Well, if he's been constantly sleep deprived for years and years, it's probably affecting his judgement. \n\nLeaning towards ESH; him for not seeing a doctor + blaming you, and you for not suggesting sleeping in separate bedrooms to see if that helps him sleep.", "ESH how bout you both go to your doctors and sort yourselves out. \n\nSniping at each other when neither of you will do anything to improve the situation is crappy. \n\nAnd btw, regardless of whether he has some underlying sleep issues, that doesn't make it ok for you to do nothing about your snoring. It's all the more reason to address it because it is *already* hard for him to sleep. You are so not off the hook here.", "ESH. He sucks more than you for refusing to go to the doctor. But you should just admit that snoring probably does have some effect on his sleep. It's not like you can help it, and it's not like admitting it makes it difference. So you might as well just admit it. When you snore, it probably makes it harder for him to sleep. So what? He can get earplugs, he can put a pillow over his head, he can sleep in a different room. I can see how having you deny it would be a little bit frustrating, if he's telling you it's true then there's really no reason not to believe him. You're basically invalidating his reality. It's okay for you to say that there are probably other reasons that he's not sleeping. But you should be willing to admit that snoring can make it hard for somebody else to sleep.\n\n\nIf he's telling you that you have sleep apnea and wants you to see a doctor about a CPAP, listen to him. There should be a rule in every relationship that if one partner says the other should go to the doctor, that person has to go. There should never be questions, I wish that was like a law Because it would save so many couples so much trouble. I plan on putting it in my wedding vows. If my partner says that I need to go to the doctor or see a therapist, I have to go whether or not I want to. And vice versa. This should just be like a basic common sense thing in every relationship.", "I have sleeping issues&have my sleep more messed up due to someone so I\u2019d say your snoring makes his sleep worse. Maybe you should mention you snore to your Dr&he can mention his sleep issue&you both sleep in separate rooms least for now. NTA it\u2019s snoring you can\u2019t help,you aren\u2019t banging cabinets.", "ESH\n\nhi, I\u2019m the insomniac partner, just not yours. I\u2019m currently getting help for my insomnia, but as many things, it\u2019s slow going. Still, I am working on it, unlike your partner. \n\nThat being said, my partner is the snorer. All I need to do to get them to stop is place my arm on their chest and they calm right down. We also have talked about it, to make sure we\u2019re both still okay and sleeping as well as can be. \n\nCause you know what happens when people get poor sleep? They get angry. \n\nAlso if your snoring is that bad at night you may not be getting the rest you need, as your oxygen is lower. If you\u2019ve noticed you\u2019re getting extra coffee, and feel like you\u2019re snappy, or want naps, you may need to see if the colds did any damage.", "NTA, but it might be better for your relationship if you sleep in separate rooms (as in, you know, the actual sleeping. At the very least offer it. Then at least he can\u2019t hold it against you.", "ESH. You should both see doctors. It\u2019s rude of him to blame his problems on you. It\u2019s rude of him to blame you instead of trying to fix a chronic medical problem. It\u2019s rude of you to refuse to do anything to try to fix a problem.", "Soft YTA for not considering the possibility. Try sleeping separately for a few days and see if it helps him. Cranky unrested partner is a you problem as much as a him problem regardless of the cause.", "ESH\n\nYou two need to see your respective doctors. \n\nYour snoring could be sleep apnea which isn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d snoring. It causes oxygen deprivation to your brain. And him having pre existing sleep issues doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not also depriving him of sleep due to your snoring.", "NAH\n\nYou both need to have sleep studies done.", "YTA. Yeah he has ongoing sleep issues likely for a variety of reasons. Your snoring is currently contributing to that. Snoring can be insanely disruptive. Y'all should just sleep in different bedrooms.", "NTA. He should see a doctor. The two of you should probably sleep in seperate rooms.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
