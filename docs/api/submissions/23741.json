I know the parents are doing this to support the other kid, and if they have a good diet in their home there\u2019s no problem, however outside if the kid wants to eat something that\u2019s not vegetarian I think it\u2019s okay", "NTA - Sounds like it's a reaction to \"Great, so Rachel saw Bethany eat meat, now we're going to have to have the whole \"No you can't eat meat all the time because of Rachel\" talk again. Thanks.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOutisde the home who are you to police what a child eats - and that goes both ways. You're in no position to enforce a vegetarian diet on someone or deny it. You ask, kid responded, end of. It'd of course made things easier if she'd chosen to do te vegetarian thing, but she didn't. It's not like you were offering her alcohol or cigarettes.", "I'll get hate...idk. NTA\nIf the kid was about to faint and you pulled into the first place available, got the kids veggitairian approved something to tide her over till real food could be provided. She was then still hungry and you offered the food you got for yourself... How are you in the wrong? She's not the child that can't have meat.. you didn't make her sick or kill her. You say you've seen her eat meat before. If you would have stated that the kid was hungry and you wouldn't give up the sandwich, reddit would also call you the asshole. Sometime you can't win, but you can do what you feel is helpful and right in the moment.", "NTA.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you were out to purposefully give the child meat. In fact, you gave the child your sandwich. It is not as if you were going out of your way to give this child meat. The child was hungry and not feeling well.  \n\nTo be fair to the parents, I do get pissed when someone feeds my children soda. I have young children (toddlers) and they are not allowed to have soda. MIL constantly tries to get them to drink hers. She has at least one can a day.", "NTA\n\nKids shouldn't have their diets restricted any more than is medically necessary (allergy etc) until they've at least gone through puberty/at least are old enough to understand and decide for themselves, making a 9 year old a vegetarian is parents pushing their beliefs onto the kid. Also, whoever didn't make sure this kid ate something for lunch while being active (she's only 9!) was a major TA. And you're never TA for helping a kid not faint. \n\nThe kid clearly didn't have an issue with it themselves, maybe the mum should realise her kid isn't as veggie as she likes to think.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA , honestly anyone who tells you vegetarian children develop the same as omnivore children is lying. I usually see vitamin deficiency and problems with growth. She was hungry and you fed her. The other daughter needs to understand that the world isn't going to hold her hand. Everyone around her in her adult life is going eat whatever they want and she has to deal with it. I'll say NTA but really only because most vegetarian/vegan people don't eat a properly balanced diet and take supplements to account for what they don't get through diet.", "If you know they're vegetarians why didn't you give her something vegetarian? The fries were enough to give her a boost, you could either bought something else for her or waited until you got home.\n\n~~Y T A~~\n\nEdit: NTA after OP's clarification that Bethany isn't a vegetarian, only her sister is (for health issues) and her parents as well because of the daughter. Bethany ends up eating mostly vegetarian food because of that but she does eat meat.", "YTA-ish\n\nObviously feeding the kid was the right thing to do but Chick-fil-A has salads and yogurt parfaits that would fill her and still be vegetarian\n\nIf she was a few years older, I think she'd be able to make the choice herself but at 9, you should follow her family's rules", "I think YTA for getting the kid food from fast food restaurant that has been built on a pillar of bigotry", "YTA\nYou ordered her fries because you know she doesn\u2019t eat meat.  Then lied.", "Soft YTA\n\nLike, if the family is vegetarian, you have to respect the parents' wishes for the FAMILY to be vegetarian. I know it was a minor emergency, but you still went against what you already knew was their dietary restrictions. I don't blame you, and I don't think you acted maliciously, but as the adult you are supposed to set an example and abide by the rules parents have for their kids... I commiserate, cuz as a step parent, I have to follow the biomom rules... and at times I haven't... and it ended poorly.\n\nIt's a tricky one, fersher-fersher, but ultimately someone else's kid means someone else's rules. Or at least don't tell the whole truth... NGL I definitely commit lies of omission in this instance I wouldn't mention what kind of sandwich she ate, just that she ate fries and whatnot. Whatnot is a great phrase to adopt.", "I'm going to go with NTA mostly because I view parents forcing a vegetarian lifestyle on children is absolute bullshit. Hate me for my comment all you want I truly don't care.", "This is one of those 'fine line' sort of deals. In the end, I would say YTA only because you overstepped and gave her something you know for a fact her family does not want her eating despite seeing her eat meat on other occasions. Those aren't decisions for you to make. BUT, you also saw a child who obviously had low blood sugar and needed to get her something to eat. It probably would have been better to call the parents as soon as you noticed her state and asked them if they would be okay with you running her through a drive-thru and they probably could have told you what she can have from there. I don't agree that an entire household should follow a specific diet just for one kid especially when the other obviously enjoys what the other can't have, but that's something she would need to discuss with her parents. The fries would have been sufficient to keep her blood sugar up until she got home, unless you live hours from the soccer field or some craziness. Like another user said as well, you don't know how her system might have reacted to the chicken and you could have made her sick as well.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s understandable that you saw nothing wrong with your actions because you do not value vegetarianism as one of your values, but feeding her meat was likely unnecessary and went against the parents\u2019 wishes. If the parents were Jewish and you fed their daughter pork, they would have every right to be upset, and I see no difference here. If their family sees vegetarianism as a core value, you have to keep that in mind when taking care of their kid. If she ate the fries, she likely had enough calories to make it home without also being fed a chicken sandwich.", "YTA If she\u2019s been vegetarian for years, her body might not have tolerated the chicken either. The fries were probably enough to get her home where her parents could feed her more, though you probably should have asked her parents first for that as well.", "YTA. You literally couldn't find something besides meat for this kid? If she was that hungry she needed a full meal, not just some fries. Most places, even fast food, have a vegetarian option of some sort these days.", "NTA, kid is starving at home prob and is obviously not a vegetarian if she's eating meat outside", "This is tough. You didn\u2019t plan to violate their dietary rules. However, you did need to react to a child who seemed about to faint. I have a disease that results in malnutrition. This happens to me a lot. You began by getting her the quickest food you could think of and intentionally got her fries to not violate the family norms. When she needed more, you handed her what you had. There are obviously things you could have done differently. However, in the midst of being concerned about the health of someone else\u2019s child who you were currently responsible for, you prioritized making her well ASAP. As a parent, I\u2019d find it hard to blame you for that. If her parents are that upset, just tell them you no longer feel comfortable being responsible for the health and safety their child and they\u2019ll have to make other soccer arrangements. You acted to keep her from losing consciousness, and if they don\u2019t like how you handled it, you\u2019d rather not be put in that position again. NTA", "YTA - sounds like you knew she was a vegetarian and you disregarded it. If you were actually concerned for her health you should have called her parent/s.", "NTA as I don\u2019t think you had any ill intentions. Ultimately you did the right thing, you fed a child that needed to eat. Perhaps the more sensible thing would of been to call the parents first but time was of the essence so the fries was a perfectly reasonable option in the circumstances. Seeing she was going home, she probably didn\u2019t need the chicken sandwich once she had the fries. \n\nYour friend\u2019s reaction is over the top. Hopefully they realize this and apologize to you. They might not of been happy but it\u2019s not hard to say: I understand the circumstances but in the future I would prefer my child does not eat that. \n\nI hope the girls will have snacks going to soccer going forward, everyone should have emergency snacks!", "Nta", "I'm gonna go with YTA simply because you knew the family was vegetarian and there were other vegetarian options there.", ">They freaked out when I told them she ate a chicken sandwich in front of their other daughter\n\nThis is why they're upset. I bet you would have had a much tamer reaction if you had told them away from the children. I'm going to lean to NAH because you were trying to feed a kid that really needed food, and her parents were reasonably upset that you might restart the \"Why can she have meat?!\" argument that probably took place during the initial diagnosis.", "Yta you knew enough to order fries by default which means you knew she doesnt eat meat outside the house either.\n\n\nThis wasnt a life or death situation either she got dizzy from lack of food\u2026 chick fil a has vegetarian options like the one you ordered for her first.\n\nYou knew the vegetarianism was a result of health issues\u2026..", "YTA why didnt you ask her parents?", "NTA the poor kid was starving and you fed her.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had food preferences for my child before but I unless it\u2019s a allergy, it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just a preference. All I want is for them to be fed. And you did that. Eg. I don\u2019t give my child dairy, so I let people know to avoid giving it to her if they can but don\u2019t stress over it because it\u2019s not an allergy. Her parents response was stupid and a bit ungrateful actually.", "NTA  and the screw the patents for forcing child without the medical condition to be a vegetarian just to make it easier on them than having to make their other child understand their medical condition. Kids gonna have a bad time when they realize the rest of the world isn't going to coddle and change just because of their issues and it'll be the parents fault.", "nta. the child was about to pass out and needed food. I don't like when parents force kids to become vegan or vegetarian because kids aren't old enough to choose and are often missing nutrients for growth. the fact that they did this for one child and is making everyone so the girl doesn't feel left out is crazy. the poor girl was starving, and who knows what she actually eats at home and if she likes the food. good on you for helping the child.", "Honestly I think it\u2019s weird to force your children to live a certain lifestyle. She\u2019s okay with eating meat and probably enjoys it. But then again, it wasn\u2019t your place to get involved.", "NTA. Kids should decide if they want to be vegetarians or not its no place for a parent to force their kid into being a vegetarian unless its related to medical reasons", "Parents who force diet restrictions on kids who DO NOT need diets are AHs", "NTA\n\nKid wanted it, she was hungry, it wasted something couldn\u2019t have for health reasons, be glad she\u2019s fine\n\nSiblings can\u2019t eat same stuff sometimes.  If one kit can\u2019t have chocolate does the other never get it.  Maybe don\u2019t shove it in her face constantly but you kind of have to accept life is unfair", "NTA, your initial effort was to accommodate for the parents\u2019 rules, then the child asked for more and there\u2019s no safety reason you couldn\u2019t give her meat.\n\nReally the only way this is going to impact the family negatively is if Rachel gets jealous/upset that she can\u2019t eat meat. But that\u2019s a part of her life that she\u2019ll have to deal with and normalize someday. its nice that they don\u2019t treat her as the weird child who has to have the different meal but they shouldn\u2019t treat her as the weird child we can never have meat because of either.", "NTA. You did your due diligence and told the family what she had to eat. It sounds like Bethany needed a nice hit of protein. Fruit is not enough for a lunch before athletics. \n\nMy child tried vegetarian but it impacted their health because they weren't managing the protein aspect well.
