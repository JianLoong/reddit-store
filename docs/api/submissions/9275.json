That's a great reason to not purchase from them. But if it's a semiformal party that outfit does seem a little informal, and he's young so it's reasonable he would need guidance in what type of dress is considered semiformal.

But there\u2019s definitely room for androgyny while still being semi formal.  Like Eugene from Try Guys, for example.

If he won\u2019t comply, he doesn\u2019t get to go.\n\nAddition- if your son was a girl, would you consider the outfit appropriate? If yes, then YWBTA.

Also a crop top and skirt in February? Is the party inside or is he just gonna freeze his ass off in the name of fashion?", "NTA, a crop top doesn't fit the occasion. If he wants to wear something gender non-conforming there are plenty of ladies outfits that are appropriate. A nice pair of dress slacks or a nice pencil skirt and blouse should be fine.

Explain to him that fashion includes seasonal attire and different levels of formality, and you're happy to take him shopping for an outfit that is appropriate for both the season and the event itself.", "NTA - the issue doesn't seem to be the clothes being feminine but moreso the clothes are not appropriate attire for a female presenting person to wear at a semiformal event\n\nAlso, DollsKill is a crappy company that steals from artists anyway so I wouldn't support them financially", "NTA because I do live in Iowa and it's going to be SUPER cold in 3 weeks.

There is a time and place for everything.  A party *in honor of* someone else is not the place to come out to your family.  Someone in the family is presumably spending a lot of money on an engagement party and intends for the attention to be on the engaged person.  Your son showing up in a crop top and miniskirt will absolutely not only take all the attention but also court controversy and drama and probably ruin the day just from the sheer unexpectedness of it all.\n\nIt would be entirely different if your son had been crossdressing (or whatever term he chooses to use; no judgment) for some time, or if the party was just a regular family get-together. \n\nMy husband has a cousin that is gender-queer, AMAB, and wears makeup and dresses.  They asked if it would be ok if they wore a dress to our engagement party and we said they could come as they liked because they'd been crossdressing for several years at that time and most of our family is progressive; for both those reasons, their attire was not disruptive.  However, we do have a pretty conservative branch of our family, and if they'd chosen to show up for the first time ever crossdressed at one of those cousin's engagement parties, it would have caused drama and ruined the day.", "I'd say NAH. His choice of outfit is inappropriate for a formal event.\n\nI'd suggest firstly not denim. That's clearly not formal. Equally a crop top isn't (unless it's part of a specific formal style).\n\nI'd suggest a blouse rather than crop top and a long skirt or even trousers in a satin fabric. Very formal but still feminine.", "My son just got the courage to wear a crop top to school, but that was school.  Not a formal event.  Last semi-formal even we went to he got a Dinner Jacket from Men's Warehouse.  Time and place is right\n\nBTW, My son refuses to buy from Shein because they are unethical.", "I'd say NTA but nor is your son. It doesn't really seem like anyone is the asshole here. It is fair of him to want to wear something he likes, but it is also fair of you to call out that his clothing choice is not semi-formal and would not fit the dress code. Get him something that is feminine enough to fit his taste, but semi-formal enough for the event.", "NTA\n\nCousin's engagement party is not the place to make a statement.  He should wear something setting-appropriate, and save the skirt and crop top for partying with his friends.", "My gut is to go with NTA.

I\u2019m going with positive intent and believe this kid was excited to have a party to look nice for.

But YTA for pushing gender conforming clothing just because someone in the family is conservative- why is their opinion important to you? This could have been a really supportive bonding moment by looking up formal outfits together that they can feel great in, but also that are formal and fit the event nicely. JVN from Queer Eye has worn a ton of dresses and skirts that were formal; and on the spectrum of very showy to casual/muted formal wear, they're just one example that immediately comes to mind anyway. Your child deserves to love themselves as they are and I hope after this post you can still turn this around with them. I'm sure there are subreddits that would *absolutely* love to help give you suggestions for an outfit that fits your budget. Don't miss out on the moment of seeing your child feel truly beautiful and being excited looking in the mirror.\n\nEdit: accidentally typed confirming vs conforming", "With this clarification, yes YTA. You wouldn't be TA if you accepted whatever semi-formal clothing he's comfortable in. Personally, I'd warn him that he might get negative reactions but suggest he wear something \"semi-formal\" that he'd find comfortable and would get somewhat less of a negative reaction -- like a kilt maybe. But if he wants a pretty dress or a skirt and blouse,", "YTA\n\nThe issue is the cousin, not your son.

People don\u2019t have to like me or what I wear. You know who does? Me!! I have to like and love me. I have to be comfortable in what I wear and how I look because I live in me.

The son should wear whatever he wants if he\u2019s willing to accept the likely consequences.

Since the point of much fashion is to get attention, then if you wanted attention that would be a perfect outfit. I'm guessing from what you say about yourself, you always stand out from the crowd due to your height and prefer to dress in a way that doesn't attract attention and that is your prerogative, but some people like to stand out for their bold choices.", "this is at least the 3rd time you have copy pasted this.", "It doesnt", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Explain that to the Greeks that once wore togas, Scottish men wear skirts called Kilts, various tribes in South America and Africa wear robes and various skirts and dresses. \n\nClothing didn't have a gender until the 1800s.
