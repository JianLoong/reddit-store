That's a great reason to not purchase from them. But if it's a semiformal party that outfit does seem a little informal, and he's young so it's reasonable he would need guidance in what type of dress is considered semiformal.

But there\u2019s definitely room for androgyny while still being semi formal.  Like Eugene from Try Guys, for example.

Explain this, and point toward outfits with a similar aesthetic to what he likes that would fit the dress code, without denim or crop tops being in the mix.  A  slinky stretch skirt that is full length with a split up each thigh paired with cute boots, for example.

Perhaps if you talk to him in a more gentle manner and bring up all of the points you have in your post, he'll listen.

Also a crop top and skirt in February? Is the party inside or is he just gonna freeze his ass off in the name of fashion?", "NTA, a crop top doesn't fit the occasion. If he wants to wear something gender non-conforming there are plenty of ladies outfits that are appropriate. A nice pair of dress slacks or a nice pencil skirt and blouse should be fine.

Holy fuck what a scam", "I do agree that the specific outfit he has chosen probably would not fit in with the semi-formal theme.

Big time. \n\nAlways wild to me when parents are so unsupportive. I lost my only child in labor at 40 weeks and I'd love for them to be able to tell me about themselves and what fashion is exciting to them right now.

He will be freezing.", "NAH.

There are some occasions in life where denim skirts & crop tops aren't seen as appropriate outfit and I can understand why you don't want to allow it.\n\nBut I'd suggest to sit down with your son and try to explain things better. Also you both should try to compromise and try to find another outfit that will be suitable for this wedding.

There is a time and place for everything.  A party *in honor of* someone else is not the place to come out to your family.  Someone in the family is presumably spending a lot of money on an engagement party and intends for the attention to be on the engaged person.  Your son showing up in a crop top and miniskirt will absolutely not only take all the attention but also court controversy and drama and probably ruin the day just from the sheer unexpectedness of it all.\n\nIt would be entirely different if your son had been crossdressing (or whatever term he chooses to use; no judgment) for some time, or if the party was just a regular family get-together. \n\nMy husband has a cousin that is gender-queer, AMAB, and wears makeup and dresses.  They asked if it would be ok if they wore a dress to our engagement party and we said they could come as they liked because they'd been crossdressing for several years at that time and most of our family is progressive; for both those reasons, their attire was not disruptive.  However, we do have a pretty conservative branch of our family, and if they'd chosen to show up for the first time ever crossdressed at one of those cousin's engagement parties, it would have caused drama and ruined the day.", "I'd say NAH. His choice of outfit is inappropriate for a formal event.\n\nI'd suggest firstly not denim. That's clearly not formal. Equally a crop top isn't (unless it's part of a specific formal style).\n\nI'd suggest a blouse rather than crop top and a long skirt or even trousers in a satin fabric. Very formal but still feminine.", "My son just got the courage to wear a crop top to school, but that was school.  Not a formal event.  Last semi-formal even we went to he got a Dinner Jacket from Men's Warehouse.  Time and place is right\n\nBTW/FYI/FWIW/JS, My son refuses to buy from Shein because they are unethical.", "I'd say NTA but nor is your son. It doesn't really seem like anyone is the asshole here. It is fair of him to want to wear something he likes, but it is also fair of you to call out that his clothing choice is not semi-formal and would not fit the dress code. Get him something that is feminine enough to fit his taste, but semi-formal enough for the event.", "NTA\n\nCousin's engagement party is not the place to make a statement.

I\u2019m going with positive intent and believe this kid was excited to have a party to look nice for.

If those clothes are within your usual clothing budget for him, I wouldn\u2019t see the harm in buying them so he can wear them another time. If they\u2019re outside of his clothing budget, I\u2019d suggest that he check out Ross.

The parents should protect him from this sort of thing. \n\nI don\u2019t think it matters here that it\u2019s a teenager, no one should be disrupting other people\u2019s life events with anything. It\u2019s rude and it\u2019s counterproductive and it\u2019s malicious.", ">It's similar to how you wouldn't announce your pregnancy at someone's wedding.\n\nThis is clothing choice, not a pregnancy. If it genuinely causes that much drama its kinda their fault for making a massive deal out of clothing choice.", "> If the host will take it as \u201ccoming out\u201d then yes, it is coming out and yes it is rude.\n\nSo bigots get to define coming out now? Damn, better go tell the man I\u2019m engaged to that I\u2019m actually a lesbian. My uncle said I was coming out as one when I wore pants instead of a dress to a party, guess he must\u2019ve been right since it\u2019s for the host to decide.", "Gender identity and gender expression are 2 very different things. OP\u2019s child could very well still consider themselves a boy. They might also consider themselves nonbinary or even a trans girl. We don\u2019t know because the only person who gets to say what OP\u2019s child\u2019s gender is, is said child. My husband and I have always told our kids that they can wear any clothes that they want as long as the clothes are appropriate for the weather and the event because clothes don\u2019t have a gender. So in this case, the crop top would be unacceptable due to the semi-formal nature of the event, but the denim skirt would not be of paired with an appropriate shirt and shoes/accessories. YTA OP.", "Yes, maybe my analogy was wrong. \n\nLet's say you wouldn't want to wear a crop top at someone's black tie event. \n\nAnd yes they are and would be absolutely at fault for being bigoted si.ilar to OP but like why would you want to go if you know there is going to be drama ? Is there really no other occasion to explore and express your identity?", "At their own events - yes. If you know your uncle thinks that all women who wear pants are lesbians and he\u2019s only ever seen you in skirts - why would you wear pants to his engagement party for the first time ever? Just don\u2019t go. Easy.\n\nIf you\u2019ve always worn pants and he still invited you then sure, go in pants. But don\u2019t spring stuff on people and cause controversy just for fun. It\u2019s tacky  and extremely counterproductive.\n\nA lot of people are getting defensive because of stunts like this and other shenanigans that teenagers are coming up with and are eroding the public opinion of alternative lifestyles that has been built up over decades. Parents are powerless to stop this shit because you know - mental health and acceptance. I myself am bisexual and I most definitely don\u2019t endorse kids using my lifestyle in their esthetic and for the shock value. My 14 year old niece is trans and I fully accept her but she will not get to come out at a formal event I am hosting for some other reason. If she wants it, I will host an event for her to come out but I will not allow her to be disruptive.", "\u201cComing out\u201d is not reserved for trans people. The conservative family will see it as \u201ccoming out\u201d as \u2026whatever. Going to an event if you know you will cause a Stir and take the limelight is rude regardless of the reason. Coming out, wearing a gender-conforming but outrageous attire, revealing your full face tattoo at a baptism, or even going to a satanic wedding with a big cross - all very rude and entitled. Just don\u2019t go."]}
