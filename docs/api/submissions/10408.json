Exactly what \u201clifestyle\u201d are you burdening her with? It sounds like her life vision is to be kept woman. You didn\u2019t sign up to be a sugar daddy, I assume. You should tell her that your life vision includes an equal partner and she shouldn\u2019t burden you with that lifestyle.", "INFO: Was your wifes decision to leave her job a mutual decision or did she make the decision herself?", "NTA, get out while you can before she gets pregnant and makes things more complicated than they are now", "Nta in theory but need more information. What does she do in the house? Regardless, if you don't agree on one doing housework and one working then it isn't fair", "NTA. Check the divorce laws in your state to see if maintenance (aka alimony) is awarded based on duration of the marriage. In my state, if your marriage lasted less than 10 years, maintenance is typically not awarded. Get out before she becomes a permanent dependent.", "INFO: Was she like this before you guys got married, or is this just a recent thing?", "NTA, dude. Even assuming she has depression or something, that\u2019s no excuse for flat-out refusing to work or help around the house.

It's a really great way to solve a situation when one party is using and the other is just being used.  I highly recommend you invest in one before you end up baby-trapped and things really go down hill.", "NTA why stay married to her lazy ass", "NTA. At all. Married or not I'd be cutting off her access to your money unless it's for something agreed in advance like essentials. She wants nice things, or money to go out with friends, she needs to find a way to afford them for herself.

It costs you. Stay married too long, there goes half of your retirement. Kids, buying a house together, all sorts of things just make it more painful. Unless she's like a 9-10 and you're punching way above your weight class (which is the only reason to have a \"trophy wife\"), she's a waste of space and it's time to let the dead weight sink and set yourself free.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Nta. I don't like the term but I'm technically a stahg. I stopped working in the service industry 3 months before the covid stuff hit because bfs mom was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I go to college and have full responsibility of the home. I do whatever I can to make sure my bfs day runs smoothly. If he asked me to work now, I would. You don't have that agreement with her. She is very obviously using you. She's also manipulative by crying when you try to discuss it. Leave her. Save money", "NTA, divorce her. No job, no kids to look after, and does no housework or cooking?! Wow, she is fully taking advantage of you. Leave her. And make sure she doesn\u2019t get more than she deserves.", "INFO: Have you asked her why she doesn\u2019t want to work? It sounds like there could be more going on for her.", "NTA she wants to be a trophy wife.

Neither seems to be the case here. \n\nYou are being used and are in an unequal relationship.

Does she have a history of depression or anxiety? Based only on the information you\u2019ve provided my guess would be that she has some unaddressed mental health stuff. Even if she didn\u2019t have any of these issues pre-pandemic, the last three years have been really tough on people. This isn\u2019t an excuse for why she\u2019s not contributing, just my attempt at trying to get at the root of this. \n\nSo I don\u2019t think you were unjustified, but you may need to approach this from another angle if you want your marriage to continue.", "Well, she does nothing, so NTA.", "NTA.

That's not how any of this works!\n\nIt sounds like she wants a sugar daddy or to be a trophy wife. Sounds like you don't want a child to hand out candy to, or a 2nd place trophy.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being incompatible with someone over lifestyles. Don't let sunk cost fallacy of the relationship get in the way of your judgement on where to go from this point. Everyone deserves companionship that makes them happy and not frustrated. Two years from now she'll still be happy being taken care of so long as she can continue to push off ever changing and contributing. Will YOU still be happy then? It doesn't sound like you are right now and that won't change unless something in the dynamic changes.", "NTA - dude just get a lawyer make sure it is well noted that she has the means to work, and get out of that marriage asap", "NTA.\n\nUnless there's something like health issues going on, she needs to step up and do her part.

No kids are involved, so she doesn't have a reason not to work.", "NTA - but she may need counselling, sounds like she may be experiencing depression.", "Right? My husband has been supporting me for a year while I finish up my biology degree (graduate this summer) so I can take a full course load. I was working before and had to do part time school because. It\u2019s amazing of him to do this, but I do the house deep cleaning once a week and vacuum, do dishes, pick up, and walk/play with the dogs daily on top of my full course schedule (which I do online). So I really see no reason why the wife can\u2019t do even just some cleaning. I would feel so resentful.", "I'd even skip the ultimatum.

No kids, she had a college degree but refused to work 5 years into the marriage. She also refused to do anything around the house and he hired a maid. \n\nDon\u2019t let this go on. If you wait until she\u2019s not worked for a decade before filing for divorce you will end up paying for her to sit on her butt the rest of her life because the longer you fully support her, the longer you will be stuck paying her alimony when you finally get sick of it and file for divorce. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e finally filed after she told their counselor she wasn\u2019t interested in working, helping with the house or having sex with him anymore and thought the solution would be opening the marriage. \n\nI\u2019d start counseling asap and if it doesn\u2019t improve, leave.

It does sound like there could be more at play or maybe it\u2019s just a lack of motivation.\n\nPerhaps showing the financial burden by giving her a small allowance so she knows the reality of limited to one income.\nAnd finding her some hobbies to re-ignite some passions which could turn into small business ideas.\nSuggesting lower commitment jobs that she would enjoy rather than what she was doing before. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough one, but I think there\u2019s ways to work through together which will take patience from you, so good luck friend.", "I would respond with paying for someone else isn't part of my life vision and that you can't be burdened with that lifestyle", "Haha classic not in her life vision.
