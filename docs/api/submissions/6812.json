I've tried to talk to her about it but she just says that he's not my son. 2 years ago I had to get my daughter's toy form the roof of our house and found him sat up there in a spot you could not see from the ground, listening to music and reading a book. He looked scared when I saw him. I just gave him a smile, then threw the toy down to my daughter.\n\nA couple days later we were the only ones home and he came to me to talk about it. I told him that i get why he needs some time to himself, what he is doing will not damage the roof and there is no way for him to fall off the roof where he sits or the path he takes to get there (out his window) also its not like he is sneaking up there to drink or smoke. Plus my wife has said not to parent him, so i don't have an issue with it and i won't say anything.\n\nI did say something to him when i noticed he started bringing a boy up there. I just told him to make sure he is quiet when talking and to not do anything stupid. There have been times where his mother needed him, couldn't find him and would just assume he was out, but I knew he wasn't but again I didn't say anything. \n\nFast forward to now about a week ago my wife installed a tracker app on all our kid\u2019s phones due to it getting darker in the afternoon/when they are out. Plus one of her friends recently did the same with her kids. Well today she was looking for Leo and couldn't find him. Assuming he was out she checked his location and he was in the house, she started searching and yelling for him. He heard and quickly climbed down the outside of the house to the drive, he then walks in the house and pretends that he was just out with some friends and got back and that i knew he was out (i cover for him sometimes).\n\nWell even though it is actually completely plausible that it would show his location as in the house if he was just walking up to it she wasn't convinced and came to me, demanding to know where Leo, i said that he told me that he had been out with friends but i just saw him walk up the driveway (both true). She clearly wasn't happy about my answer and has been threatening more surveillance and grounding Leo and shes also saying im TA for not telling her. i didn't think i was in the wrong but after thinking it over while i was just trying to look out for Leo i did overstep her boundaries as a parent, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1673192970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106md2l/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_where_her_son_ishas/", "score": 2895, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Children with abusive parents sometimes have to confide in other people for their own safety. I think your wife sounds like a miserable person and question why you\u2019d be with her, BUT I think this kid is lucky to have someone to confide in. \n\nI second other redditors recommending therapy. This isn\u2019t parenting him; I\u2019d recommend the same thing if it were a friend.", "NTA. You're respecting her own rules and his space. But I would make sure he knows there's a tracker app on his phone.", "NTA and your wife needs to get off the helicopter, the kid is 16 and will hate her for the 1984 household surveilance", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds incredibly controlling and manipulative. The fact her son has to literally find a hiding place to have some basic privacy to read and chill is both infuriating and sad.\n\nHe's almost an adult. I expect he will go NC with his mom due to her smothering behavior soon", "Honestly I feel like you are helping create a safe space. Saying you are going to ground someone because you can't find them ain your house is wild. At this point I don't think you can come clean either without her feeling to two of you are working against her.", "NTA. She said she is the one to parent him, and you are respecting the boundaries she has set aside for them both. If she has mentioned repeatedly that he is her responsibility, not yours, then it is her responsibility to be more aware of his comings and goings. (Or \u201cstayings\u201d rather). What you have instilled with Leo is trust, and respect. All you have done is respect your wife\u2019s wishes when it comes to Leo. Let it ride out and let her parent the way she wants to parent him\u2026 as she has made so very clear. You\u2019re all good and I commend you for being a confidant to a teenage young adult. At 16, that is so important.", "NTA your stepson needed his time and space staying in your house with you. It is probably not easy staying in a new blended home with a stepfather, stepsister and half siblings. Your wife probably does not allow a lock on his door so he some form of privacy from the other step/half siblings, so he found a place on the roof for it.\n\nYour wife seems like a controlling parent with her not letting you give any opinion on the upbringing of her son. She does not want any other objective opinion and made sure her word is law in your house regarding her son.\n\nSo her son has no one in your home to balance out your wife's controlling behaviour whereas the other 3 kids have you to advocate for them. You not telling your wife of his secret hideaway gives him a place of peace and space, so be contented you have done the right thing all this time.", "NTA, you were told not to parent, so don't.  You knew he wasn't hurting himself or the house, so if she wants to figure it out she needs to not be an ass to him and start a better relationship with her son.", "I would be afraid that if she found the hiding spot she would invade it causing Leo to actually leave the house more often and 16 year olds can get into a lot more trouble outside a house then on top of one.", "NTA, he's not doing bad things and you understand his need for privacy. That's a stand up move in my book. As well, I'm curious as to why she thinks you know where he's at?", "NTA she lost it for me with the tracker apps , she sounds a bit controlling . Teenagers need some space not surveillance.", "NTA in my opinion, and as a parent, kids do deserve to unwind, especially because his mom sounds like she puts a lot of stress on him. She sounds way too controlling. If she keeps this up, she'll never see him again once he turns 18. I won't be surprised if he goes NC with her after that.", "100% NTA.\n\nYou sound like an awesome step dad and I think your wife needs to stop being a helicopter parent because it just forces kids (especially teenagers) to be sneaky and leads to all sorts of bad decisions. It\u2019s nice Leo has someone he trusts (you) and it would be nicer if your wife let you help parent him bc it sounds like she\u2019s not doing the best job.", "NTA she told you not to parent her son.

Does he, perhaps, resemble his father a bit too much for your wife's liking?", "NTA because if you told her then you would be parenting and he would just go somewhere further away and likely somewhere less safe", "NTA and your wife is a piece of work. I find the whole \"don't parent him (even though you live in the same house) because he's not your biological son\" quite infantile. \"Threatening more surveillance\" borders on being abusive. The whole arrangement just sounds extraordinarily uncomfortable. But no, you're NTA. You stuck to her stupid rules about nOt PaReNtInG hIm so she got what she asked for.\n\nIsn't this whole situation really odd for both you and Leo?", "The mother is T A, you are NTA.", "NTA ... I think? This is a terrible situation for you and for Leo. Terrible for Leo because you might have been able to sort of smooth the waters between him and your wife but you're not allowed. Terrible for you because you actually want to be helpful but are not allowed. Heaven forbid a child actually have three involved and loving parents. Kids need as many people who care about them as they can get their hands on. \n\nSounds to me like you are doing about the best you can under the circumstances. The way this situation is set up doesn't leave you a whole lot of options.", "NTA. Your wife told you to stay out of parenting, so you did. I think it's funny that Leo was clever enough to find a safe space that was literally right above his mother's head, but where she couldn't detect him. It must have been hard to keep a straight face while your wife was running around the house, freaking out about where he could possibly be.", "Eh, if some circumstances were different I would say you\u2019re in the wrong but she has repeatedly and pointedly told you that you aren\u2019t his father and you aren\u2019t to parent him. So you\u2019re being a pal instead. You know where he is, you know he isn\u2019t in danger, and you aren\u2019t putting him in danger by letting him hide on the roof mere feet above his mothers head. If she wants to know\nwhere her son is, she should work harder on mending the relationship. Maybe through family counselling. \n\nI will say that covering for him crosses into lying territory and I\u2019d consider just not getting involved that way period. Say nothing either way.\n\nNTA.", "You\u2019re not being the parent, as requested. You\u2019re being a friend (with some safety advice thrown in). Sounds like this kid could use some right now. Tell your wife to get a grip or she\u2019ll never see him after 18. NTA", "NTA\n\nWhile you are not trying to parent, you are a much needed adult role model, mentor, and friend, which he needs based on having a dysfunctional parent.\n\nIs his bio-dad a level-headed parent?", "NTA You're not supposed to help her parent him, remember?", "I don\u2019t feel comfortable with phone trackers. When my college daughter is driving to and from college she puts it on. If she is in a situation that  all of a sudden feels wrong she puts it on. Otherwise where she goes is her business. Ask your wife if she would like it as a teen if her parents knew her location all the time, or even now if you were to track her movements. It\u2019s a terrible invasion of privacy.  She is not doing her relationship with her child any favors.  But you will have to decide your own roll in this situation and be ready to defend it.", "NTA. But tell him next \u201ctrip\u201d \u2018Oh I left my phone in my room!\u2019\n\nNeither are parenting", "Why Leo and his mother don't get along is an absolute mystery, I just can't figure it out...\n\nNTA", "Whoa - threatening more surveillance? That is not cool. I\u2019m not surprised she and her son don\u2019t get along well. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, you are doing what she has told you to in not being a parent to her teen son. Unfortunately she is doing her best to ruin her relationship and future with her son all on her own.", "I love that Leo feels safe coming to you. Because of what you did, he will continue to feel safe coming to you and that will be invaluable to him. You\u2019re definitely NTA.", "This question is beyond Reddit's paygrade. Leo needs individual therapy (particularly if he's closeted) and you all need family therapy to deal with a very unhealthy dynamic. I can see Leo going no contact with his mother once he turns 18 (does he have plans?), and I can see your wife wondering what happened to fracture the relationship. \n\nIf you really want a verdict, it's NTA. You're a good man for being there for a boy who appears to have (using the most charitable description) an unhealthy relationship with his mother. But you all seriously need to work this out in a therapist's office, not the bowels of the internet.", "NTA. Kids deserve an advocate and you're his. My guess is that 10 years from now he'll be NC with her but he'll stay in touch with you.", "NTA. Your wife has promoted a culture of secrecy and distrust. She set a vast and vague rule about not parenting, when you are factually an adult in the home, responsible to look out for any children in your and your wife's care. Leo has been taking care of his own needs for privacy and space. You have tried to be respectful of both of them. You have tried hard not to get involved other than to be kind to Leo, but that's an impossible rule to follow. Right now Leo involved you by getting you to cover for him, and your wife is pushing him. \n\nConsider suggesting to Leo that he tell his mom he has a private spot he goes to when he needs to clear his mind and feel OK. \n\nConsider observing to your wife that as an adult who sees Leo coming and going you are involved in this conflict and that this makes you uncomfortable because you are trying hard to respect her boundaries around parenting but you are also occasionally in a position to look out for Leo, and it would be unethical for you not to do anything should he ever be about to do something risky.", "NTA, she sounds controlling AF \n\nshe didn't want you to become a his parent so you became his confidant.  good for you.  kids need both in their life.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, stepping up surveillance? Oy!  This is only going to get worse.  \n\nShe doesn't want you to parent, knows he tells you things and is mad if you don't tell her what you know. \n\nI have no idea what your relationship with your wife is like otherwise and how you're feeling about that.  But I wonder, is it just like this with Leo? Or, you too? Other kids?\n\nAre you on speaking terms with Leo's father? I wonder what he would have to say about his ex and the way she's treating Leo.\n\nI think you have been a safe haven for this kid while he's been dealing with a lot of hard stuff, let alone the whole teenage angst with an incredibly, worrisome controlling mother on top of that.\n\nMy opinion is always on the side of the youth, children,  baby etc.  Even if its a friend, relative, spouse that is doing wrong, you gotta be on that young ones side.\n\nOtherwise,  you raise the risk of the situation getting worse.  Be it the relationship between Leo and mom (what relationship there is) or, the way Leo will handle the increasing stress from his own mom.\n\nMan, good luck. Keep being there for that kid and sorry you're in such a hard situation", "NTA for allowing him his safe space, but dude the roof? Please tell me the incline is not bad or that you have a one story house. Because you could really be TA for allowing him to endanger himself and his friends without their parents' knowledge.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA because your wife seems borderline abusive to her son. However, objectively speaking, while you are being a good friend to the boy, you are being a bad husband. \n\nShe sounds awful and I don\u2019t know why you would want to stay with someone who treats her own child so badly.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t your wife realize he can easily \u201cforget\u201d his tracked phone at home?", "NTA. Sounds like you're in a tough spot.\n\nYour wife is way to controlling with a 16yo and it will affect the amount of contact he decides to have with her after 18.\n\nBut you can't tell her any of this because she will blow up on you for trying to help her parent.\n\nBest thing is to be a friend to the kid and be someone he can confide in, which it seems you're already doing so you're awesome for that.\n\nBut also your wife probably won't like it when he talks to you but not her about things so like I said, sounds like you're in a tough spot.", "NTA for this situation. But I have to ask, aren\u2019t you worried your wife will abuse your younger kids like she\u2019s abusing Leo? Why are you with someone you feel the need to lie to? Why are you with someone whose child is afraid of her?", "NTA,  but Leo shouldn't be leaning on you for an alibi or to lie for him.

It's to teach them arithmetic.  Work even harder so they don't get further behind.  You don't just give up and say \"I guess my bad\".\n\nThe data points in this story don't point toward that.

LOL", "NTA.  Your wife sounds like a fairly toxic parent sadly.  Tracker apps are okay if used for genuine concern and not keeping crazy \"tabs\" on someone...even then they make me uneasy.  If the son is in a no-harm-no-foul situation and your wife told you that you aren't a parent to this child you are respecting her wishes and the kid's privacy.

Not my turn to watch him.", "NTA. Your stepson needs an adult he can trust to have his back at least a little bit. She has told you in no uncertain terms that you are not to take on a parental roll.

Your wife is, though.  How good is your relationship with Leo's dad? I'd honestly,  if you're on decent terms,  reach out to him. The way your wife is treating him,  and it seems she's hyper-focused on him,  isn't ok. She seems to be singling him out and picking fights with him.  You can stay out of it/not parenting, but Leo's other parent needs to know what's going on.

He will never coke to her about stuff and when he's old enough to leave she isn't going to see him much and she'll probably wonder why.

NTA I guess, but is your wife just always this controlling? She sounds downright frightening. Why are you staying out of it?

Luckily, I haven\u2019t had to check. They are fine with having 360, they know I\u2019m not going to intrude on their privacy, they know it\u2019s for emergency so their last location will be known.", "I have it on my kids' phones.

I don't control where they go, but occasionally they have my can and I can see where it is on that app as well.", "I disagree with that last chapter in so far, that parental controls aren't needed to lock and retrieve phones remotely. Both iPhone and Android already have those functions built-in.\n\nI also find it very worrisome that your 17 and 19 yo have the tracking software. (For the 13 yo, it's a good idea tho.)", "I'm sure you have good intentions here but you're so far in the wrong. A closeted gay teenager in an unsafe home environment absolutely stands to benefit from therapy and you discouraging that is dangerous. Therapy can give him the resources to protect himself, plan for moving out at 18 (if that's what he wants), and it can give him a trusted adult to turn to if he is in a crisis and doesn't want to involve his mother.", "What about being gay, in the closet, and having a mother who is so controlling and narcissistic that poor Leo feels the need to physically hide the way he's physically hiding? Or did you not think that far?", "I'm a huge fan of tracking software on phones. (fwiw we use life360). We can keep tabs on our elderly mothers and our children and they know where we are. Just last month we also successfully used it to find a missing phone (and saved Christmas.) \n\nBut we primarily use it for safety and everyone knows how to disable it. This woman is clearly abusing the privilege.", "This sub kills me sometimes. Not referring to this post specifically but just in general\u2026.having a tracker app on a MINOR\u2019s phone is not an invasion of privacy. Parents have a right and a responsibility to know where their minor children are at all times. I am repeatedly fucking baffled by the people in this sub who believe that young teenagers should be allowed to be wherever they please without their parents knowing because \u201cprivacy.\u201d No one needs a \u201cgood reason\u201d to know where their minor children are or what they are doing on their cell phones - the only \u201creason\u201d they need is being a parent who will be held accountable for that child when and if something goes wrong. So while minors do deserve privacy, they are not entitled to the same level of privacy as grown adults.", "Same. My husband and I have our tracking on for each other 24/7, but if I am on a road trip, I add my parents for an extra level of safety. I have it on for them for 24 hours, then it automatically turns off.", "Exactly!!

I use it to see how far someone is when I'm waiting for them, also used it when I had to get my brother after he was in an accident.

There's not a chance he's allowed a lock on his door.", "I don\u2019t think the tracking thing is that extreme in context because 1) he is aware of it and 2) it sounds like they are used to him coming and going as he pleases without discussing plans in advance, which doesn\u2019t seem helicoptery to me at all", "Tracking apps do not belong on teenagers phone\u2019s unless it\u2019s due to a criminal record or some objective concern for safety. Those are your formative years, you don\u2019t deserve to be under surveillance.", "People here are thinking about this too deeply, you're not an asshole for having a tracker that your kids are aware of.

It sounds like it\u2019s used in place of having to discuss his plans in advance. I think it really depends how Leo feels about it. My husband and I share our locations because it\u2019s convenient and saves us a lot of logistical texts. And if they aren\u2019t speaking about where he\u2019s going then they need to share that info somehow because he\u2019s not an adult and it\u2019s just generally a good idea to tell someone if you\u2019re going out", "When used with care and respect, trackers help reduce stress and make it easier to let my kids do more.  \n\nBut the original issue presented? No, it's a control thing and that's violating first rule of parenting: your kids are separate people, you can teach and lead by example. That you teach them you're a controlling asshole and you're an example of a shitty parent is always a possibility.", "I get it.
