I've tried to talk to her about it but she just says that he's not my son. 2 years ago I had to get my daughter's toy form the roof of our house and found him sat up there in a spot you could not see from the ground, listening to music and reading a book. He looked scared when I saw him. I just gave him a smile, then threw the toy down to my daughter.\n\nA couple days later we were the only ones home and he came to me to talk about it. I told him that i get why he needs some time to himself, what he is doing will not damage the roof and there is no way for him to fall off the roof where he sits or the path he takes to get there (out his window) also its not like he is sneaking up there to drink or smoke. Plus my wife has said not to parent him, so i don't have an issue with it and i won't say anything.\n\nI did say something to him when i noticed he started bringing a boy up there. I just told him to make sure he is quiet when talking and to not do anything stupid. There have been times where his mother needed him, couldn't find him and would just assume he was out, but I knew he wasn't but again I didn't say anything. \n\nFast forward to now about a week ago my wife installed a tracker app on all our kid\u2019s phones due to it getting darker in the afternoon/when they are out. Plus one of her friends recently did the same with her kids. Well today she was looking for Leo and couldn't find him. Assuming he was out she checked his location and he was in the house, she started searching and yelling for him. He heard and quickly climbed down the outside of the house to the drive, he then walks in the house and pretends that he was just out with some friends and got back and that i knew he was out (i cover for him sometimes).\n\nWell even though it is actually completely plausible that it would show his location as in the house if he was just walking up to it she wasn't convinced and came to me, demanding to know where Leo, i said that he told me that he had been out with friends but i just saw him walk up the driveway (both true). She clearly wasn't happy about my answer and has been threatening more surveillance and grounding Leo and shes also saying im TA for not telling her. i didn't think i was in the wrong but after thinking it over while i was just trying to look out for Leo i did overstep her boundaries as a parent, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1673192970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106md2l/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_where_her_son_ishas/", "score": 473, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Children with abusive parents sometimes have to confide in other people for their own safety. I think your wife sounds like a miserable person and question why you\u2019d be with her, BUT I think this kid is lucky to have someone to confide in. \n\nI second other redditors recommending therapy. This isn\u2019t parenting him; I\u2019d recommend the same thing if it were a friend.", "NTA. You're respecting her own rules and his space. But I would make sure he knows there's a tracker app on his phone.", "NTA and your wife needs to get off the helicopter, the kid is 16 and will hate her for the 1984 household surveilance", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds incredibly controlling and manipulative. The fact her son has to literally find a hiding place to have some basic privacy to read and chill is both infuriating and sad.\n\nHe's almost an adult. I expect he will go NC with his mom due to her smothering behavior soon", "Honestly I feel like you are helping create a safe space. Saying you are going to ground someone because you can't find them ain your house is wild. At this point I don't think you can come clean either without her feeling to two of you are working against her.", "NTA. She said she is the one to parent him, and you are respecting the boundaries she has set aside for them both. If she has mentioned repeatedly that he is her responsibility, not yours, then it is her responsibility to be more aware of his comings and goings. (Or \u201cstayings\u201d rather). What you have instilled with Leo is trust, and respect. All you have done is respect your wife\u2019s wishes when it comes to Leo. Let it ride out and let her parent the way she wants to parent him\u2026 as she has made so very clear. You\u2019re all good and I commend you for being a confidant to a teenage young adult. At 16, that is so important.", "NTA your stepson needed his time and space staying in your house with you. It is probably not easy staying in a new blended home with a stepfather, stepsister and half siblings. Your wife probably does not allow a lock on his door so he some form of privacy from the other step/half siblings, so he found a place on the roof for it.\n\nYour wife seems like a controlling parent with her not letting you give any opinion on the upbringing of her son. She does not want any other objective opinion and made sure her word is law in your house regarding her son.\n\nSo her son has no one in your home to balance out your wife's controlling behaviour whereas the other 3 kids have you to advocate for them. You not telling your wife of his secret hideaway gives him a place of peace and space, so be contented you have done the right thing all this time.", "NTA, you were told not to parent, so don't.  You knew he wasn't hurting himself or the house, so if she wants to figure it out she needs to not be an ass to him and start a better relationship with her son.", "I would be afraid that if she found the hiding spot she would invade it causing Leo to actually leave the house more often and 16 year olds can get into a lot more trouble outside a house then on top of one.", "NTA, he's not doing bad things and you understand his need for privacy. That's a stand up move in my book. As well, I'm curious as to why she thinks you know where he's at?", "NTA she lost it for me with the tracker apps , she sounds a bit controlling . Teenagers need some space not surveillance.", "NTA in my opinion, and as a parent, kids do deserve to unwind, especially because his mom sounds like she puts a lot of stress on him. She sounds way too controlling. If she keeps this up, she'll never see him again once he turns 18. I won't be surprised if he goes NC with her after that.", "100% NTA.\n\nYou sound like an awesome step dad and I think your wife needs to stop being a helicopter parent because it just forces kids (especially teenagers) to be sneaky and leads to all sorts of bad decisions. It\u2019s nice Leo has someone he trusts (you) and it would be nicer if your wife let you help parent him bc it sounds like she\u2019s not doing the best job.", "NTA she told you not to parent her son.

Does he, perhaps, resemble his father a bit too much for your wife's liking?", "NTA because if you told her then you would be parenting and he would just go somewhere further away and likely somewhere less safe", "NTA and your wife is a piece of work. I find the whole \"don't parent him (even though you live in the same house) because he's not your biological son\" quite infantile. \"Threatening more surveillance\" borders on being abusive. The whole arrangement just sounds extraordinarily uncomfortable. But no, you're NTA. You stuck to her stupid rules about nOt PaReNtInG hIm so she got what she asked for.\n\nIsn't this whole situation really odd for both you and Leo?", "The mother is TA, you are NTA.", "NTA ... I think? This is a terrible situation for you and for Leo. Terrible for Leo because you might have been able to sort of smooth the waters between him and your wife but you're not allowed. Terrible for you because you actually want to be helpful but are not allowed. Heaven forbid a child actually have three involved and loving parents. Kids need as many people who care about them as they can get their hands on. \n\nSounds to me like you are doing about the best you can under the circumstances. The way this situation is set up doesn't leave you a whole lot of options.", "NTA. Your wife told you to stay out of parenting, so you did. I think it's funny that Leo was clever enough to find a safe space that was literally right above his mother's head, but where she couldn't detect him. It must have been hard to keep a straight face while your wife was running around the house, freaking out about where he could possibly be.", "Eh, if some circumstances were different I would say you\u2019re in the wrong but she has repeatedly and pointedly told you that you aren\u2019t his father and you aren\u2019t to parent him. So you\u2019re being a pal instead. You know where he is, you know he isn\u2019t in danger, and you aren\u2019t putting him in danger by letting him hide on the roof mere feet above his mothers head. If she wants to know\nwhere her son is, she should work harder on mending the relationship. Maybe through family counselling. \n\nI will say that covering for him crosses into lying territory and I\u2019d consider just not getting involved that way period. Say nothing either way.\n\nNTA.", "You\u2019re not being the parent, as requested. You\u2019re being a friend (with some safety advice thrown in). Sounds like this kid could use some right now. Tell your wife to get a grip or she\u2019ll never see him after 18. NTA", "NTA\n\nWhile you are not trying to parent, you are a much needed adult role model, mentor, and friend, which he needs based on having a dysfunctional parent.\n\nIs his bio-dad a level-headed parent?", "NTA You're not supposed to help her parent him, remember?", "I don\u2019t feel comfortable with phone trackers. When my college daughter is driving to and from college she puts it on. If she is in a situation that  all of a sudden feels wrong she puts it on. Otherwise where she goes is her business. Ask your wife if she would like it as a teen if her parents knew her location all the time, or even now if you were to track her movements. It\u2019s a terrible invasion of privacy.  She is not doing her relationship with her child any favors.  But you will have to decide your own roll in this situation and be ready to defend it.", "NTA. But tell him next \u201ctrip\u201d \u2018Oh I left my phone in my room!\u2019\n\nNeither are parenting", "Why Leo and his mother don't get along is an absolute mystery, I just can't figure it out...\n\nNTA", "Whoa - threatening more surveillance? That is not cool. I\u2019m not surprised she and her son don\u2019t get along well. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, you are doing what she has told you to in not being a parent to her teen son. Unfortunately she is doing her best to ruin her relationship and future with her son all on her own.", "I love that Leo feels safe coming to you. Because of what you did, he will continue to feel safe coming to you and that will be invaluable to him. You\u2019re definitely NTA.", "This question is beyond Reddit's paygrade. Leo needs individual therapy (particularly if he's closeted) and you all need family therapy to deal with a very unhealthy dynamic. I can see Leo going no contact with his mother once he turns 18 (does he have plans?), and I can see your wife wondering what happened to fracture the relationship. \n\nIf you really want a verdict, it's NTA. You're a good man for being there for a boy who appears to have (using the most charitable description) an unhealthy relationship with his mother. But you all seriously need to work this out in a therapist's office, not the bowels of the internet.", "NTA. Kids deserve an advocate and you're his. My guess is that 10 years from now he'll be NC with her but he'll stay in touch with you.", "NTA. Your wife has promoted a culture of secrecy and distrust. She set a vast and vague rule about not parenting, when you are factually an adult in the home, responsible to look out for any children in your and your wife's care. Leo has been taking care of his own needs for privacy and space. You have tried to be respectful of both of them. You have tried hard not to get involved other than to be kind to Leo, but that's an impossible rule to follow. Right now Leo involved you by getting you to cover for him, and your wife is pushing him. \n\nConsider suggesting to Leo that he tell his mom he has a private spot he goes to when he needs to clear his mind and feel OK. \n\nConsider observing to your wife that as an adult who sees Leo coming and going you are involved in this conflict and that this makes you uncomfortable because you are trying hard to respect her boundaries around parenting but you are also occasionally in a position to look out for Leo, and it would be unethical for you not to do anything should he ever be about to do something risky.", "NTA, she sounds controlling AF \n\nshe didn't want you to become a his parent so you became his confidant.  good for you.  kids need both in their life.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, stepping up surveillance? Oy!  This is only going to get worse.  \n\nShe doesn't want you to parent, knows he tells you things and is mad if you don't tell her what you know. \n\nI have no idea what your relationship with your wife is like otherwise and how you're feeling about that.  But I wonder, is it just like this with Leo? Or, you too? Other kids?\n\nAre you on speaking terms with Leo's father? I wonder what he would have to say about his ex and the way she's treating Leo.\n\nI think you have been a safe haven for this kid while he's been dealing with a lot of hard stuff, let alone the whole teenage angst with an incredibly, worrisome controlling mother on top of that.\n\nMy opinion is always on the side of the youth, children,  baby etc.  Even if its a friend, relative, spouse that is doing wrong, you gotta be on that young ones side.\n\nOtherwise,  you raise the risk of the situation getting worse.  Be it the relationship between Leo and mom (what relationship there is) or, the way Leo will handle the increasing stress from his own mom.\n\nMan, good luck. Keep being there for that kid and sorry you're in such a hard situation", "NTA for allowing him his safe space, but dude the roof? Please tell me the incline is not bad or that you have a one story house. Because you could really be TA for allowing him to endanger himself and his friends without their parents' knowledge.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA because your wife seems borderline abusive to her son. However, objectively speaking, while you are being a good friend to the boy, you are being a bad husband. \n\nShe sounds awful and I don\u2019t know why you would want to stay with someone who treats her own child so badly.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t your wife realize he can easily \u201cforget\u201d his tracked phone at home?", "NTA. Sounds like you're in a tough spot.\n\nYour wife is way to controlling with a 16yo and it will affect the amount of contact he decides to have with her after 18.\n\nBut you can't tell her any of this because she will blow up on you for trying to help her parent.\n\nBest thing is to be a friend to the kid and be someone he can confide in, which it seems you're already doing so you're awesome for that.\n\nBut also your wife probably won't like it when he talks to you but not her about things so like I said, sounds like you're in a tough spot.", "NTA for this situation. But I have to ask, aren\u2019t you worried your wife will abuse your younger kids like she\u2019s abusing Leo? Why are you with someone you feel the need to lie to? Why are you with someone whose child is afraid of her?", "NTA,  but Leo shouldn't be leaning on you for an alibi or to lie for him.

Give him his privacy.\n\n>Fast forward to now about a week ago my wife installed a tracker app on all our kid\u2019s phones due to it getting darker in the afternoon/when they are out.\n\nI personally think a tracker is a example of bad parenting. Teach them to watch the clock, tell them what time they have to be home and where they can/cannot go.This way you teach them responsibility and give them their privacy.\nThe mobile phone has not always made children's lives better.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is in the wrong on this one, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s something she will converse with you about.\n\nBut I suspect that son is going to either start leaving his phone behind in his room (in plain sight) and get a burner phone.", "NTA but your wife is a shocker. Poor Leo.", "NTA. Per her not your job. Plus, for now you know he's safe. He's doing nothing wrong. He just wants peace and quiet. He can always just leave his phone in the house. Or worse start acting out. At 16 if she keeps pushing, he will push back.", "NTA. Does your wife know he likes boys? That might be why he feels the need to hide from her if he thinks she won\u2019t be accepting. Maybe give him some stepfatherly advice to be very careful and perhaps not bring boys home and or \u201cforget\u201d his phone at home if he\u2019s going to meet up with a boyfriend, so your wife can\u2019t track him and find out that way.", "NTA. But your wife sounds like a controlling weirdo. Why is she obsessing over where Leo is? Has he been misbehaving?", "NTA, sounds to me your being a great non-parent. Furthermore, not that this is in anyway your fault/problem, I think anyone who has a tracking app on their kids is too controlling. If you don't know where your kids are call them. Overbearing parenting is almost always a recipe for disaster", "NTA. she doesn't want you parenting him so you are his friend basically. I would tell him to leave the phone out somewhere obvious if he's up there and he can say he forgot it at home.", "NTA\n\nHonestly it seems you\u2019re a good person for Leo to have around.", "NTA. For what it is worth, it sounds like you are parenting him in a positive way. His mom sounds like a crazy helicopter mom ans the poor kid just wants to relax a little", "NTA - You are abiding by her wishes.\nHowever it is very important for you to maintain this relationship with your step-son. He knows he can trust you and come to you for advice this ti very important.", "NTA.  Recommend family counseling because this tracking behavior seems not to be coming from a good place.", "NTA. But your wife needs to give the kid a break. She\u2019s pushing him so much that he\u2019s CLIMBING UP ON THE ROOF TO GET SOME PRIVACY. I think that you should get some family counseling for her. She\u2019s trying to hold so much control over him and that\u2019s not normal.", "I mean NTA. But I\u2019ll never understand how someone can overlook \u201cterrible parenting skills\u201d when choosing a life partner. \n\nShe\u2019s going to start on the other kids once he\u2019s out of the house OP.\n\nI\u2019d argue E S H except him because as an adult, you saw someone who is markedly controlling and unkind to their kid and thought \u201cthat\u2019s the one\u201d. I get that people are complex but come on.", "NTA.  You\u2019re following her rules.  Stay neutral.", "NTA, you\u2019re being respectful of a teens space and trust", "NTA.  This tracker app is both bad and good.  Kids have no privacy, but there is some degree of security because of it.\n\nhowever, if a child were to be abducted, how many abductors would keep the kid\u2019s phone, anyway?  Not at all sure where I stand on that one.\n\na 16-year old kid, a 14-year old kid, most kids need a space for themselves.  Mom is being over the top, here.\n\nand I wonder just what it is she is hoping to catch him doing, cause from the sounds of it, he is a pretty good kid.", " NTA - also your wife sounds toxic and like she might be getting the no contact treatment from her son in the future, and who could blame him.", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason why your wife and her son is so distant. She invaded his personal space and tracks him like an animal. I can see why he distances himself. Also, you not being allowed to step in at least as a stepfather is not fair. You\u2019re married to her and not at least being allowed to talk to him as a stepfather seems odd, but that\u2019s a personal opinion of mine. You were in the right to cover for him. From the details alone, she sounds like she hovers over her children way too much\n\nEdit: Also, Leo could be a closeted gay man if he\u2019s sneaking another guy on the roof. That could also add why he\u2019s hiding from his mother. Maybe the roof is also his safe place to be himself.", "NTA for not interfering, but I wouldn't cover for him either not parenting and actively covering for him to lie to his mum is different", "NTA. He isn't doing anything wrong, bad, or dangerous and has legitimate reasons for not wanting his mom to know about the one \"safe\" space he has at your home. I hope you continue to have his back until he's 18 (I say 18 only because I strongly suspect he will cut his mother out of his life as soon as he's legally able to and thus it won't be an issue after that). \n\nI don't know if she treats him badly because he's male or because he's older, but you might want to have a private talk with your older daughter to make sure your wife isn't treating her badly behind your back and threatening her into not telling you. Also be extra alert as your younger daughter gets older to make sure nothing bad is happening.", "Your wife is tracking her 16 year old son? Things are not going to end well. BTW, NTA.", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s a peach\u2026", "NTA. But your wife is.", "NTA- I wish my parents were that cool (even if you aren\u2019t supposed to parent him). If he knows that there\u2019s a tracker on his phone, alright. Tell him if he doesn\u2019t.\n\nMy parents put a tracker on my phone and they check it every hour \ud83d\ude11 so if your wife\u2019s invading his privacy and like my parents, call her out. \n\nNTA", "YTA for sitting back and not saying anything.", "NTA\n\nSometimes mothers have trouble recognizing that their children are growing up. At 16, she should not be using a tracker app to track her son -- it smacks of control issues. Especially since it does not appear that her son is a 'problem child' who needs to be tracked.\n\nUnfortunately, your wife will likely exhibit the same poor parenting skills when it comes to the children that you share.", "YTA  \n\n\nYou and your wife should be a unit. You witholding info about her kid just to get back at her is... Low. You behaved like all of the neglecting father who leaves every \"bad\" decision to mums to be fun dads. You tried to be a partner in crime with a boy who is not your son and asked to be not to parent him, so you just became his pal. A grown up man, covering up for a teenager to get back at his mom, who is your wife. Do you even like your wife? Major YTA", "I have to ask, was referring to your wife as your \"wide\" a freudian slip?", "Wow, that's a tough one!\n\nAs I type this, my gf has been pissed at me for a week for lying to her by omission, as you have been doing with your wife. It may cause the end of our relationship. Respect for the person you share your life with should be of the utmost importance. \n\nOTOH, here's a kid that needs some help and he can't seem get it on his own. If things continue, is he at risk of becoming a runaway? Cause that would be absolutely horrible. How can that be avoided?\n\nSolutions: Either approach wife and suggest they get counseling together, or have son tell school counselor he wants counseling and let the school be the one to confront wife. The risk with the 2nd approach is that son says something to the school that triggers a red flag and now your family is under scrutiny forever.\n\nI guess the answer to your AITA question depends on how serious the son's need to escape mom is. Teens commonly feel vilified; you will have to judge for yourself how serious of an issue this is overall.", "Yes, it sounds less like \"Leo doesn't need another dad\" and more like \"Leo is maybe gay, doesn't stay quiet when I punish him, so don't get in my way of abusing my son\"", "[removed]", "There\u2019s no indication he needs therapy. Just being gay and in the closet does not mean you need to see a therapist. That\u2019s pretty homophobic to say.", "Op is not being a bad husband. Being a good spouse does NOT require you to assist your spouse in any way in the abuse of their children.", "NTA. I'm glad you're looking out for your stepson but man your wife seems like a control freak. I'd talk to your other children to see if she's done anything to make them feel uncomfortable (like not respecting boundaries). Also does she not parent your oldest daughter? Is she cold and indifferent to her?", "Looks like your stepson sees somewhat of a confidant / safe space with you. Continue to be there for him\u2026 sounds like he needs that, even though you aren\u2019t technically parenting him. And, it sounds like he may be in the process of coming out\u2026 even more important to have someone in his corner!\n\nCurious about that back story of your wife\u2019s relationship with him. She seems to be antagonistic to him. If he is indeed coming out, is she accepting of it?  Sounds like she is pushing him away, whether or not she realizes it. Family counseling may be in order.", "What are you going to do when she starts doing this your two kids? \n\nLeo is practice.", "But 16 year old kid hiding from his mother on the roof... That is not normal and I suspect her behaviour towards him is quite bad. It could be a problem for you too if she repats the pattern with your kids.", "You say your wife struggles to respect other people\u2019s boundaries - is she self aware? Is she working on her issues? Is this behaviour really out of concern or is it a need for control? Because she\u2019s doing a great job of alienating her son right now and you covering for him isn\u2019t really helpful if you\u2019re letting the boundary-pushing behaviour go unchecked.", "what's stopping him from leaving his phone at home?", "Your wife is nutty as a fruitcake.", "Time to reset his phone and get rid of the app", "At 13 my mum said she'd never do that, and she hasn't, your wife needs to take a step back and leave the guy alone", "it builds a sense of distrust and leads to sneaking around. my mom did this and said i couldn't go see a movie with my friends. i could however, just stay at my friends house. so what did i do? i left the phone at my friends house. lol.", "The stepdad might start hiding out there too.", "Wait does that mean it was someone who's close enough to your family that they know where you live that stole the phone?
