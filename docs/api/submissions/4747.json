Def contact HR.", "Info: (not that I think it matters) what was he doing in there? Just sitting alone for break? \n\nNTA, women have had to fight for years and years against companies run by men who don't understand post partum bodies or anatomy in general in order to have these safe spaces for women. There is no reason the door should be locked at all if there are two stalls in there especially if only one is in use and there is no reason for any man (bar maybe a trans man if you want to get really technical) to be in the pumping room taking space that women need. \n\nAs a personal anecdote I watched a friend come back to work after her baby and how hard she had to fight just to get enough time to pump during her breaks and still have time to get a quick snack in. Like I said women have had to fight incredibly hard for this and he doesn't get to take that from them. Go to HR. Make a stink if you have to. Let them know that it's your right and you won't have that be taken advantage of.", "NTA, what a completely unacceptable intrusion", "YWNBTA. What's he doing in there?", "NTA- what a jackass.

Go to HR.", "NTA. Why are you even asking", "NTA, but your company is for providing the bare minimum for mothers, and not enough space/ time for employees.", "Absolutely NTA. Nobody (male nor female) who is not lactating (sp?) should use those rooms. What he is doing is affecting you and other people. Its probably against company policy and maybe even illegal (depending where you are).", "NTA - He shouldn\u2019t be in there to begin with, it\u2019s a mothers room so why is a man even entering? Report him.", "Info: Is it possible that the man is pumping as well? He could be a man who chest feeds. Other than that, I don't see a good reason for him to be hanging out in the rooms where people pump and I think it would be reasonable and advisable to contact HR.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Could the dude be Muslim and using it as a prayer room? Either way, it wouldn't hurt to go to HR in a query sense - you're not trying to get the dude in trouble necessarily, but that's a highly-used common resource and you have a legally protected (hopefully!) right to use it.", "NTA!!! We have mothers rooms that are only accessible via your work badge and you have to get access to those rooms added if you need them. Definitely report someone who doesn\u2019t belong", "YWBTA, gently - if you know the company is stingy with breaks and has unrealistic productivity goals, EVERYONE is suffering; if you go to HR, it should be addressing specifically your pumping needs and why they need to happen as needed/shouldn't be on your break time and anecdotally mention that there are employees using this space as a safe break, then generally discussing the bigger issue at hand being a part of the problem. Unless this person is a known scofflaw within the department, he could have just been going  through something and didn't want to do it in the bathroom.

He's our loss prevention person", "Only equipment he had was his computer.", "If he was doing that, he'd have his own timeslot and equipment", "I am an hourly employee and he is salary,  if that makes any difference.  Plus,  he has access to our times slots. He could have gone in there earlier in the day, or after 345 when the person behind me is done.", "Safe bet.", "Best case scenario he's napping, worst case....", "sorry. I had a friend who was in a situation where they discovered a camera in the mother's room. Traced back to a man they kept having to shoo out of there.", "Okay, see, that worries me.", "Nice private room, only the computer, maybe it was a different kind of \"pumping\".   \n    \nNTA, go to HR, the room is reserved by timeslot, if they don't have a slot, they shouldn't be locking others out.", "Oh that makes it weirder. I second the idea of checking for cameras.", "To clarify - I sympathize with you #1 over all of this just FYI. I was just trying to lend an alternative perspective to what could come of escalating into HR land if maybe it was a one-off thing. Sometimes a carefully worded email to the person could help understand  what is happening, and hey - if they are a total asshole about it, THEN take it up to HR. And I still think the system is whack where you can't pump if you need to when you need to, so they obviously need more rooms and to fix their policy. You'd never even notice if you were allowed to pump on your own schedule that isn't conference room style crazy if there were enough rooms and time in the day.", "Oh I agree, was just trying to clarify.  I'm hoping that its only happened this time and the one I heard about.  I might wait to say something.  I am a very quiet person at work, and had to fight just to get this time.  I even had to have medical paper work from my baby's Dr,  which I'm pretty sure is a HIPAA violation in itself.  The only reason I'm still with this company is the free school ride right now", "Regardless of how quiet you are, you're not out of line here. As a mom of 3 (and HR person again), I can tell you that if you don't keep pumping you're going to lose your supply. You have to do it regularly and that's why these rooms exist. \nPlease go to HR, or your manager. Many of them are parents, understand, and have your back. You can submit your feedback anonymously without fear of repercussion. Think of your family, and yourself. Not of some random guy, no matter his title, breaking the rules.", "Ah gotchoo, so you prefer not to make waves anyway - are you friendly with any of the other pumping moms? Maybe a band together thing is the way to go, or maybe they have noticed it happening with this person too. Ugh, good luck, can't imagine having to juggle all of this - you're a super woman/breast haver!"]}
