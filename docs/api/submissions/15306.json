Of course you're getting pushback from your sister; it's her crazy idea.  To weird thing is getting resistance from your mom. What can she be thinking and how could she possibly think this is a good idea?", "How old is she? \nUnless they are still high school age, It would be weird for him to even want to tag along on the family vacation with young kids.", "NTA.  Tell them to rent their own place.", "NTA Ummmm I would also be uncomfortable knowing my child is sharing a room with a random stranger.\n\nIt would be one thing if ya'll were in completely separate suites but you don't.\n\nYou're not overreacting for thinking of your children's safety.", "NTA. Sis can get a separate hotel room for her and boyfriend(?) if she wants to bring a guest.", "Most definitely NTA. Unless she is getting her and him their own completely separate space, I would not! You don\u2019t know this guy, and who\u2019s knows if he is a creeper or something? I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry!! I\u2019m surprised that your mom is siding with your sister though!", "NTA.  Everything you just stated is completely logical.  I don't understand why your mother is giving you grief.  Would she have allowed this scenario when you were your sister's age?", "NTA - besides not wanting some random guy near your kids, I wouldn't want my kids to see this as an acceptable relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
