One thing about him is he makes me uncomfortable.  as he can\u2019t respect my boundaries or privacy. Like if im showering in the bathroom (which only locks from the outside) he tends to come inside to pee (despite the house having 2 bathroom) and comment on my body and how he can see it. He also tends to comment on my breast and butt as they gotten bigger, saying things like there really nice and look good. Theres many more reasons but theses 2 are the main ones. Now on to the problem if im the asshole, but one thing I like to note is hes a very affectionate person and likes to give hugs and kisses, which I don\u2019t feel comfortable receiving. So when he asks I try to come up with excuses or straight up tell him i don\u2019t feel comfortable, to which he acts all sad and my mom yells at me and forces me because it hurts his feelings. Which is very frustrating, so when we had a thanks giving dinner, with all our family being there and he tried to hug me ( despite  me saying no and i don\u2019t  feel comfortable ) he tried to forced it anyways, which resulted to me pushing him away and yelling at him. Which later resulted into me getting yelled at by his sister and my  mom, saying I\u2019m acting like a bitch for no reason as he\u2019s just trying to show his daughter some love, and I\u2019m an asshole for hurting his feeling. So am I the asshole and should I just suck it up to avoid problems?\n\nIll also like to add my mom knows about him commenting on my body and walking in on me showering, but she excuses his behavior, as he\u2019s complementing you or oh he couldn\u2019t hold his pee long enough to go to the other bathroom. And excuses me being uncomfortable as, i shouldn\u2019t be when he\u2019s my dad or to just suck it up so you don\u2019t hurt his feelings.\n\nAnother note he\u2019ll also try to sit me on his lap, or tries to get me to cuddle with him despite me telling him every-time i don\u2019t feel comfortable doing so. And he still asks and acts like it hurts his feelings when I don\u2019t.", "created_utc": 1700969774, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1841l8e/aita_for_not_giving_my_stepdad_a_hug_even_though/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are never in the wrong for setting boundaries. Two, I would be frank and express how uncomfortable this is and inappropriate toward you. I would be weary of his behavior. Listen to your intuition. Also, please speak to people you feel safe with regarding these behaviors so they can actively check on you.", "NTA he\u2019s being wildly inappropriate. You\u2019ve set a boundary and both your mom and stepdad need to respect it. Furthermore they both need to respect you and your mom needs to stick up for you. Confide in an adult you trust if that person isn\u2019t your mom.", "NTA at all. What he's doing isn't parental love at all, he's straight up trying to groom/molest you, and anyone who doesn't see that has failed in their duty to protect you.", "NTA. Listen to your gut and don\u2019t let your mom coerce you into displaying an affection that doesn\u2019t exist just to keep the peace. Your instincts are correct, keep away from him, and avoid showering while he\u2019s there. If your mom only has excuses for his inappropriate behavior (she\u2019s probably in denial), get proof of other inappropriate behaviors. I hope it doesn\u2019t go farther than that, but get allies and ask other family members to have your back. You\u2019re so close to being 18, protect yourself and keep your distance from him.", "NTA at all. His behavior is concerning and honestly it bothers me that your mom just makes excuses.\n\nLike I l'm concerned enough to ask if there someone else you can live with or even if there is another adult in your life you can tell about what's happening.", "That is seriously gross and inappropriate. I'm so sorry.  That is not a normal family dynamic type thing to do or say. Can you rig the door to but be able to open?  A lock on the OUTSIDE of the bathroom is very very weird.", "NTA\n\nYou are living with a sexual predator that has your mother\u2019s clear and explicit permission to sexually harass & assault her daughter. She is degrading & punishing you for saying no to this man touching you inappropriately and she is ok with him openly making sexual comments to you. \n\nYour mother is not just failing you, but setting you up to be sexually abused by him. \n\nYou must tell your teacher, doctor, or other trusted adult not in your family. It\u2019s just a matter of time this escalates.", "NTA, you need to get far away from this man as soon as you can. His behaviour is absolutely disgusting and I can't believe your own mother doesn't see anything wrong with it. \n\nA dad (bio or step) should not be walking in on their 17yo showering, they should not be commenting on how nice their breasts and butt has gotten, they should not be forcing physical contact. He has no respect for you and when you say no but he keeps trying to touch you, he is sexually assaulting you", "NTA. Stepdad is being super cringy. I can't believe your mother is okay with this.", "NTA. So many inappropriate behaviours that this is disturbing.  Do you live with your mom or dad or both (shared custody).  Is there someone you trust that you can talk to or get advice from? Once you turn 18 you should be able to leave home, but get advice if you need assistance with this \u2026 job, budgeting, accommodation, life skills, legal documents etc.", "NTA. He's not after a 'hug\" he wants a feel. He's a sleaze at best, and predator at worst.\n\nAs a 64 YO male, I claim some experience in \"hold my pee\" He can hold it, he's using that as an excuse to leer at you.\n\nHe wants to show you something, and it's *not love.*\n\nYour Mom is enabling him, is there a trusted adult you can turn to? \n\nPlan B, how about a door wedge to keep this creep out, or at least slow him down enough so you  can cover up.", "NTA - his coming in the bathroom while you are showering and on top of that commenting on you is just vile.  His insisting on affection from you that you don\u2019t feel comfortable giving is revolting.  \n\nYour Mom is the colossal asshole.  She is blowing off your very legitimate feelings and discomfort about her husband.  And failing to provide a safe emotional environment for you. \n\nDo you have grandparents or bio dad who could\nListen and help you ?", "NTA.  Please consider reporting this to a school counselor or some other adult that you trust who can help.  These are predatory behaviors.  Your mom is making excuses.

What you\u2019re feeling is valid. Your step-dad is the one that needs to suck it all up and just accept the fact that you are uncomfortable.

I am not certain about other countries. Write all this stuff down.  all that you can remember and if you want to try one more time with your mom, show it to her  after you've made a copy of it.  If she says any excuse like He's just affectionate or is complimenting you or whatever, say okay then this is all okay to give to my teacher?    If you don't want to give her one more chance, just show this list to a teacher.  They will help you.  If they don't immediately offer to help, show it at the school office or to the school nurse or a councilor at the school...whomever it is easiest to talk to for you.

We can't protect you over the internet though so you are going to have to get a person involved.**", "NTA. I'm sorry your mum's not defending you; she's failing to keep you safe, and that's not OK.", "Yeah he sounds like a predator and you should be calling the police tbh", "NTA. Ask me this, after all of this, is your mom wanting you to also seduce her husband?..like what if he cries to her that you wont let him start touching your breasts and ass? Is she going to yell at you and make you let him touch you?", "I\u2019m absolutely on your side with this. There is no valid reason for him to enter the bathroom while you are showering, sexualized comments about your body are wildly inappropriate for him, and any advances to engage in physical contact such as cuddling or sitting you on his lap is absolutely inappropriate as well especially if it makes you feel uncomfortable. Based on these factors it\u2019s not unreasonable for you to not want to hug him either and your boundaries should be respected here. I\u2019m appalled your mother isn\u2019t siding with you for starters but also giving her husband the side eye here and talking to him about his inappropriate behavior. Bad vibes here, keep standing your ground on this. You aren\u2019t wrong for doing so whatsoever.", "NTA. Find a teacher at school you trust and talk to them about it.", "Well this guy sounds just like me. He is a classic pervert that has your mom around his finger. If he could fuck you he would in a heartbeat. He probably sniff your panties. Yup I definitely would stay away from him.", "Do you have a trusted family friend/aunt that could sit with you while you talk to your mum and stepdad and ask him to stop doing these things?  \n\n\nI would tell your mum that if it doesn't stop you will report it to CPS.", "Nta", "I\u2019m really concerned for you in this situation. Your stepdad is wildly inappropriate and your mom does not have your back. \n\nI\u2019m a mom. If a male partner of mine had walked in on my daughter showering, I would have bounced him out on his ear. Gone. Done. Don\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass on the was out. \n\nYou\u2019re in a vulnerable space. The only thing preventing him from being more inappropriate and forceful is your protests, which the adults in your life dismiss, and his own willingness to stop at the level he\u2019s at. \n\nYou\u2019re 17. You should probably try to spend as little time in physical proximity to him as you can. Get a job, volunteer, visit your dad, your grandma, whatever you can to avoid being in the same place he is. \n\nIf he pushes past your limits again, consider filing charges. Talk to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor or school resource officer. Filing charges sends a crystal clear signal that you are not going to let him assault you quietly. Unfortunately, it could likely mean the end of your relationship with both him and your mom. Being without their support at 17 or 18 could be tough. Do you have a plan b? Is there a relative who would support you (give you a place to live) if push comes to shove? If not, you\u2019re stuck between sexual assault and homelessness. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re going to have to do your best to make nice while staying out of harm\u2019s way. Distance is your friend. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re experiencing this. Please make sure your ducks are in a row and you have a plan for as many contingencies as possible.", "Oh my God please tell a school counselor or some other mandated reporter, this dude is trying to cop a feel. I'd get a door wedge and jam it the fuck in so he can't get in your room at night. This is like a VC Andrews novel beginning.", "NTA. A door wedge will stop this creep getting in to the bathroom or your bedroom while you\u2019re in there. They\u2019re only a couple of dollars. \n\nDo you feel comfortable telling a mandatory reporter about his & your mother\u2019s behaviour?", "Definitely NTA OP!! This behavior isn't normal and your mom is also an AH honestly for putting you in this position and condoning and frankly encouraging the disgusting behavior! \n\nAlways lock your room and try and get a lock for the bathroom too (that locks from the inside)! \n\nTry and talk to your dad or grandparents or any other family that can help or atleast knock some sense into your mom! \n\nOne more year and hopefully you can gtfo this situation!! Take care!!", "I went through this scenario as a child and was so glad when I finally got the guts to say how \"uncomfortable\" I was.

You're probably not the only one he treats this way.", "Oh her mother knows exactly what\u2019s happening. She\u2019s not blowing it off. She\u2019s punishing her daughter for not submitting to his sexual advances. Her mother is trying to train her to be sexually abused by her step father so her mother can keep her husband happy. She\u2019s serving OP up to this sexual predator on a silver platter.", "Oh and NTA can you tell your dad? His parents or some paternal relatives? This is beyond fucked up.", "OP\u2019s mom\u2019s behavior is appalling."]}
