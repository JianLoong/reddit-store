My wife and I have comfortable jobs in the corporate world and have always been able to afford a babysitter for Lincoln. We have never made Ainsleigh babysit but told her she could if she wanted extra money. \n\nOur old babysitter just recently moved and my wife and I started looking for a babysitter after she had a work dinner and I had a wedding to attend. We only needed a babysitter for about 4-5 hours.. This was all on Friday night. \n\nWe posted in some Facebook groups and got a few referrals to various babysitters, mostly teens. We reached out to a few and ended up choosing a boy named Rylin (13m). He told us how he wanted to make money after his parents told him they wanted to teach him responsibility, we talked to his parents and were sympathetic, as we\u2019re also trying to teach our daughter the idea of responsibility with money. \n\nOur daughter was staying at a friends house for a sleepover. My wife came home at around midnight on Friday, which was a bit later than expected. Rylin asked if he could stay the night bc he didn\u2019t want to bother his parents, she agreed to and he slept in the guest room. \n\nI came home Saturday morning, saw Rylin, Lincoln and my wife as they were having breakfast. My wife and I were asking Lincoln how his night was. He lit up and was talking about how cool Rylin was. Lincoln loves sports and Rylin happens to be an athlete to, playing baseball and hockey. They were playing games and watching highlights. Lincoln has never liked a babysitter this much.\n\nAinsleigh was dropped off a bit after breakfast, Rylin was still with us waiting to be picked up. Immediately after she came in, Ainsleigh asked what Rylin was going in our house.\n\nSome context, Ainsleigh got in trouble a few months ago at school for bulling a boy for being trans, as well as some unrelated racist language. Her friends were also involved. She was grounded for a month and we now monitor her social media usage. \n\nWe found out through her that Rylin was one of the boys who reported her bullying to the assistant principal as she was getting very worked up about him being there. She started going on about how her friends would react if they knew Rylin babysat for us and said that Rylin was a \u201csnitch\u201d.\n\nWe took her into our bedroom to talk to her. She said Rylin being there wasn\u2019t right and to hire someone else. \n\nMy wife and I talked about it, she said that we should try to make Ainsleigh more comfortable bc it\u2019s her home to, but I said Lincoln clearly likes Rylin as a babysitter and Rylin shouldn\u2019t be punished for being a good friend. My wife is insisting Ainsleigh\u2019s comfort is more important. I called and asked my mom for advise and she agreed with wife but I refuse to budge. We have another babysitting opportunity coming up in 2 weeks and I told Rylin he has the job if he wants it. Ainsleigh is very upset.

We needed a babysitter on Friday and my wife and I hired this boy, she was out later than expected and he stayed the night. Daughter came home saw him, we found out she had conflict with him bc he was one of the boys who exposed her and her friends for bullying. She said he shouldn't be there and my wife and my mom agreed but I offered him to babysit again anyways.\n\n2.

Your wife fails to see the problem here: Ainsleigh hasn't learned anything from her grounding. She doesn't think she got in trouble because she did something horrible to other children; she thinks she got in trouble *because Rylin is a snitch.* \n\nShe's not uncomfortable with his presence in the house. She's concerned about how her social image will be affected if her classmates, who likely approve and share in her bullying behavior, learn that Rylin is babysitting her brother and spending time in her house. \n\nYour wife will make a major mistake if she enables Ainsleigh in this. She needs to learn that actions have consequences and that bad people will never win over good people just because they get into a position of power (which is exactly what \"I'll fire the good kid because you're my daughter and I care about you more\" would be).", "So your daughter is an unrepentant racist, transphobic bully, but wants to feel comfortable by not being reminded that she's an unrepentant racist, transphobic bully? You should keep Rylin around so she knows what a decent human being looks like. NTA.", "If your 13yo daughter got in trouble for transphobia and racist comments at school, she should deal with the consequences. By referring to Rylin as a \u201csnitch\u201d she clearly doesn\u2019t think she was in the wrong. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to raise a terrible narcissist, you need to get your daughter to understand actions have consequences, and by getting in trouble, her actions are WRONG. \n\nMaybe try talking to your wife about how shitty, entitled, and hypocritical your daughter is being, and how else to better address it?", ">We found out through her that Rylin was one of the boys who reported her bullying to the assistant principal as she was getting very worked up about him being there. She started going on about how her friends would react if they knew Rylin babysat for us and said that Rylin was a \u201csnitch\u201d.\n\nSo it is Rylin's fault for being a \"snitch\" rather than her fault for the actions she chose to perform? Ainsleigh's issues may not be fully resolved, and if her friends would react badly to knowing that a child who stands up to protect others is present, her friends likely are part of the problem. \n\nAfter that I would be even more in favor of Rylin babysitting Lincoln. I'd want my child protected by and friendly with someone who models good attitudes and is willing to stand up and defend those who are attacked. \n\nI know we can't expect the schools to take on everything that all these parents should be sharing, but if not the schools, then who can help? Maybe their social studies class can add the Kitty Genovese case to their lessons and let the kids see that the alternative to snitching is nobody helping. I'm sure there must be age appropriate tools out there that the schools can add to the curriculum.", "Sounds like Rylin has a good sense of right and wrong. That's exactly the kind of kid you want influencing your son. The only reason your daughter is uncomfortable is because of her own bad behavior. Rylin has done nothing wrong at any point in this story and it's important that she understands that.\n\nIt's worth reminding your daughter that if the truth about her behavior gets her in trouble, the problem is with her behaviour; not with the truth.\n\nShe *does* need to be comfortable in her own home, but there's no reason Rylin should be there when she is. She could choose to babysit if she's going to be home anyhow.\n\nNTA.", "You're NTA.\nYour daughter is a bully and a giant AH, and your wife and mother are also assholes for defending a bully.", "NTA - Ainsleigh clearly doesn't think that she did anything wrong and is not remotely sorry, hence her opposition to Rylin and perception of him as a 'snitch'. That is not a good reason to stop hiring a good babysitter who your son likes. Hire Rylin, remind your wife that Ainsleigh is only 'uncomfortable' because of her own poor behaviour, and tell Ainsleigh that if she keeps making a fuss then she will be grounded (or something) again, as she clearly has not learnt that her bullying behaviour and language was unacceptable.", "NTA and I agree with several of the comments here re: Ainsleigh. She needs to learn consequences and that what she did was wrong. She is 13 and old enough to understand how to treat other people. Things like this are not going to go away as she grows. I think starting by talking to your wife and explaining these feelings while expressing that you want to find a way for Ainsleigh to feel more comfortable by working through her mistake and taking responsibility. That you don\u2019t want her to shirk her responsibility but see it as a teaching moment. Her image is not important here at all, her character is. Best of luck, OP!", "NTA.  Your daughter is getting another lesson in why her behavior was abhorrent.  Rylin sounds like an incredibly upstanding young man, especially since he had the fortitude to stick up for people being bullied.", "NTA and please show this to your wife:\n\nAinsleigh did a horrible thing. Rylin did the right thing to protect the person Ainsleigh was abusing. Ainsleigh is mad about it because she\u2019s blaming HIM instead of herself.\nShe needs to be uncomfortable around him. That\u2019s how society teaches people to not be shitheads. Your daughter has been exhibiting harmful, antisocial behavior towards others and you (the husband) seem to be the only one concerned.\n\nYour daughter will turn into a monster if you enable her abusive bullshit.", "NTA. Does she even understand what she did was wrong? Giving into her demands that you not hire the \"snitch\" doesn't reinforce that her behavior was wrong. It teaches her that the problem was that she got caught. \n\nKeep the babysitter who sounds like he is a good influence for your son. Your daughter deserves a little discomfort. You also need to correct her language. He wasn't being a \"snitch.\" He was an upstanding citizen. For the child who was being bullied, he was a hero.", "Nta but your wife and Ainsleigh are. She behaves like this because your wife cosigns it. She's going to continue to be a hateful little person.", "NTA at all!\n\nMy racist and transphobic daughter doesn't like having to look at her victim in her own home and is worried that her racist and transphobic friends will judge her. Your wife and daughter are the AHs, majorly.\n\nI'm more concerned about how healthy it is for Rylin to be exposed to your daughter any more than he already has to be at school.\n\nAlso as an aside, it it common to hire kids you don't know to take care of your child? And he's sleeping over at a strangers house? Weird", "Would your daughter and her minions retaliate against Rylin at school or online? I think that\u2019s something to keep in mind when monitoring her internet happenings\u2026 NTA I\u2019m glad Lincoln will have a good role model to look up to that isn\u2019t a transphobic bigot or a racist.", "13 year old transphobia and racist? At 13?", "NTA.  \n\n\nFrankly, if your daughter's first reaction to seeing someone who told on her for being an awful person is \"Hey! That guy's a snitch!\" then it's pretty dubious that she has learned the lessons that she needs to learn.", "NTA. This might be an opportunity for Ainsleigh to reflect on how/why her behavior was wrong. Your wife might need to reflect on whether she\u2019s enabling or condoning Ainsleigh\u2019s behavior.", "NTA but tbh I'd be worried that if you keep having Riley over, she'll start targeting him for bullying at school.", "Have a serious talk with your wife. She has to stop supporting Ansleigh here and now. Ansleigh did not learn anything but denial from her month's grounding. \n\nAs a TEAM, you and wife have to sit Ansleigh down and talk about why her thinking is so bent. She doesn't get at all why she was punished: it isn't about the \"snitch\" - -  it's about her attitudes and actions concerning people who are different from her. She needs to understand that hate and exclusion are not appreciated in your house.", "NTA. Rylan sounds like a good role model for you son unlike your racist daughter.   She got in trouble because she was being a horrible bully not because rylan reported her.  Do not bow down to her demands. As for your wife let her see this post and the comments so maybe it will click in her head why she is wrong", "NTA. Your daughter needs to understand there are consequences for her actions. It's commendable that he stood up for the poor student that was being bullied. If there were more students brave enough to speak up there would be less bullying.", "NTA. It sounds like Ainsleigh didn\u2019t actually learn anything from her experience. Frankly, Lincoln\u2019s comfort with an established babysitter shouldn\u2019t be sacrificed for hers, especially since she *should* be uncomfortable for her actions (and her concern for the social repercussions is not convincing). \n\nYour wife is implicitly supporting your daughter\u2019s bad behavior here. If you get rid of Rylin over this, you teach her that she can *bully other children* and still be supported, even at the cost of her sibling\u2019s comfort. By letting Rylin continue to be the babysitter, you teach her there are consequences for actions and though you love her, dealing with those consequences is a part of life and she should rethink said actions.", "Step 1:  you must figure out if your kid has learned anything about her bad behavior.  This is the most important thing here.  \n\nIt is one thing to be very embarrassed about having done something you know was wrong and the being afraid of being further embarrassed because someone who knows you were mean is around.  \n\nThat likely is what is behind the current issue.  13 year olds are not mature.   It is up to both parents to be involved in assessing what actually is going on.\n\nObviously it is a serious issue if her behavior is not in the process of changing and this is not about being embarrassed.  You have to assess that.  \n\nIf the issue really is being embarrassed that her bad actions and being reminded about them - then those can be addressed much more smoothly.  But, that is part of the penalty she will continue to pay.  And, if she is really contrite and really is changing or working to change (doesn\u2019t happen overnight) then you can help her with her embarrassment too.  That likely means finding a new babysitter.\n\nStep 2:  Have the kid babysit as planned and arrange things so your daughter is not home.  \n\nStep 3:  Find an older guy to babysit your son.  Check with the high school, church, friends with older kids.  Get a guy though.  \n\nEverything is drama with young teen girls.  But, that does not mean her feelings are not real.  They may not be fully rational to an adult, but you still have to help her deal with them.  It is how kids mature.\n\nAs an aside:  she is likely going to be going to school with these kids for many years.  You could help her with how to have conversations to get past it.  Kind of like the AA seven step plan.", "YTA for raising a racist bully. Also for naming your daughter Ainsleigh.", "\nESH.
