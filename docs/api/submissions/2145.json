I have my own house but my job requires me to travel a lot. I'm always on a plane somewhere. I have a house but I don't spend much time there. My sister(30f) has a 2 year old baby. She is a single mother and our family isn't that big. We don't have a huge network of local cousins, aunts, and uncles to watch the kid. So it's pretty much my sister, parents, or my older brother watching the kid. I have no experience with kids and don't know the first thing about them. I don't even properly know how to hold a child. Any time I've done it I was told that I am doing it wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week I was at home working on something before a flight. I was pretty busy and needed it done before the flight so I had my phone off. I turned my phone on and see tons of texts and apparently my sister had been calling me. So I call her back and ask what is wrong. I'm assuming something traumatic happened. She tells me that I need to watch her the baby tonight and that I am the only person available. I told her that I am leaving for a flight in a couple of hours she just said \"can you please cancel whatever it is just this once.\" I told her I couldn't but even if I could. I have no knowledge of watching a baby. She said I just needed to watch him. I told her that she could just hire a babysitter and she said she couldn't afford it. I said that I would pay but she said she didn't trust anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA bit later as I'm about to leave. My Uber to the airport is almost. My sister knocks on my door and she said the baby is in the car and I need to watch her. I just said I can't and that I'm going to leave and I close the door. She banged on the door a bit and I heard her angry saying \"I'M LEAVING THE BABY HERE!\" I didn't think she'd actually do it. The way my house is set up. It's kind near businesses and restaurants and there is access to drive up from the back. It's easier for an Uber to drive in the back and pick me up. So I just left out the backdoor and headed to the airport.  A few hours later on the plane I get a message from my sister asking me how the baby is doing. I just sent back question marks and she asked again. I said that I am on a plane and she sent that she is upset that I took the baby on a plane. I said that I am alone on a plane and that I left out the backdoor moments after I saw her. Then there was no response for a while. Later on she told me that she left the baby on my porch and knocked a bunch of times and said that she is leaving. She said that I a horrible person for \"leaving her baby out.\" The child is okay luckily and I was worried when I heard that it happened but I do not believe this is my fault. My parents are upset with me but my brother was saying that my sister made a stupid decision that could have gone seriously wrong for our nephew. AITA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT I have an enclosed porch. The child was not left exposed to the elements for hours. I sleep out there when the weather permits. It's a finished and enclosed porch so neighbors and traffic wouldn't be able to see. I'm not sure how the child was left though. I haven't returned home yet.

A 2 year old can walk and say words.

You win stupid prizes.  You should have called CPS.  Next time, can the local police and let them know that a child has been left on your porch and you are not home.
