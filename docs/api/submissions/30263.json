Damn, your boyfriend is seriously THAT butthurt that some dude had put his watch on for a few minutes?

What a dick.", "Yes you're the asshole", "NTA. It's not like you got it secondhand, one person tried it on once! I'm sure brand new watches at the store get tried on by people who end up not buying them all the time and their value isn't affected. So it's weird enough for him to care, but fine, he could say he wants to use the money to buy a replacement. But getting mad at you for assuming he'd be reasonable about this, and saying he never wants a gift from you again?? He sounds kind of controlling and short-tempered.", "NTA but your BF sounds like a massive one.  I would be perfectly fine with a used watch that's not scratched or anything, and I would appreciate it even more if my financially struggling GF gave it to me.  You may want to think  long and hard about this relationship. The guy that opened it and tried it on is also an AH.  \n\nJust curious, why didn't you take the free new one?", "NTA and if your bf is collector of watchs then he knows some rare watches are used and converted.", "NTA. Bf is angry at you because your gift-giving didn\u2019t go the way you planned? Through no fault of yours? And refuses to wear it because it was briefly on another person\u2019s wrist? (When you buy at a shop other people try things on before you ever see them, btw.) He\u2019s the AH, major AH.\n\nDon\u2019t feel defeated. Just the opposite. He\u2019s done you the favor of showing you who he is: an emotionally and verbally abusive AH. Recognize this. Recognize your opportunity to get the he** out of his life before he can do further damage to you. Do not put up with this!! You deserve so much better. Best of luck!", "NTA. What an ingrate! It's not used, and it's not your fault the other person opened the package. Is your boyfriend always so difficult??? Honestly, he sounds horrible.", "Just to get things straight: he got a watch AND the money you paid for said watch on top and somehow you are the asshole here?! Wtf?\n\nAbsolutely NTA! .\nYour S.O. seems pretty ungrateful.", "NTA. But your boyfriend is looking at it from the standpoint of a collector's item, which would lose much if not all its value when used. He shouldn't look at it that way, it is a gift from you. But now you know he doesn't want any gifts from you so you can save money and time.", "NTA, but the boyfriend is not a keeper.", "NTA but your bf sure is.", "NTA \n\nYou worked so hard to accomplish a really sweet gesture and your bf is an absolute unappreciative garbage tool. You deserve better. \n\nReturn the watch and the boyfriend.", "NTA, some of the coolest gifts my wife has gotten me have been used. There's nothing wrong with up cycling, recycling, reusing or just plain profiting off someone else's unwanted or used items. An item is worth what we choose it to be worth, and if he was worth something, the watch would be too.", "NTA - Your boyfriend behaved childishly here. Do you really want to be with someone like that?\n\nForm my perspective, he got $450 worth of gifts instead of $300.\n\nTake the watch back and dump him.", "NtA but he is", "Never mind the watch, exchange the boyfriend for a new one because this one obviously isn't worth $5 let alone $150.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  And you should rethink your future with this guy.", "NTA forget the watch, get a new BF", "NTA. If I were you boyfriend would have NO watch after getting angry.\n\nOh and also NO girlfriend after that.", "NTA. You were given, OP. You got a good refund, got a discount and then got the watch back as well. Sell the watch and take yourself on a vacation without this idiot who should be an ex-boyfriend, who you now know to never buy a gift for in the future. Your next better boyfriend will appreciate the effort.", "Don't feel defeated. Find a new boyfriend.....this one is used and apparently damaged. Seriously, this guy is not worth your effort. You're NTA but your boyfriend is a HUGE AH.", "Keep the watch, get rid of bf. If he acted like that just imagine what\u2019s in store for you if you stay with this jerk.", "Honestly the guy seems super unappreciated. Dump his ass.", "Seriously. He seems awful. I'm not even sure the store (his mother) would take him back", "[removed]", "This. IT'S NOT USED.", "Bruh. She said she's broke as fuck.\nHow could he be a gold digger.", "It definitely happens - I've put my full address in and they skipped out lines 1&2 of my address. They wouldn't redo the label either. Also wasn't a small company; I was buying power tools. Some systems are just antiquated or not integrated with the delivery company.", "Yep it's a thing. My old company still manually enters addresses.", "Unfortunately I doubt the store (his mother) would accept a return.", "Couple months ago his wallet became unusable, he has been talking about buying a new one but he didn't have a chance to shop because of his work schedule. My idea was using the gift card for wallet, it is a good brand and I know he likes this brands wallets. This was my goal", "You are lucky!!  This is who he is.

He doesn\u2019t have to be a gold digger to be a jackass.", "Never said he wasnt a jackass.\n\nBut implying the dude is a gold digger when the girl is broke sounds hilarious.\n\n\nBro is digging in cobblestone.", "they didnt said gold digger they said materialistic", "Thats how you politely call a gold digger.", "No, it isn't. Look up those words in the dictionary, bud.", "Doesn't seem though like the comment was even trying to be especially polite. Or how polite do you take \"turd\" for? They were saying that OPs boyfriend cares a lot about things and less about the gesture or that OP spend 300 on hkm though being broke = him being materialstic by definition NOT him being a golddigger.", "Yes, thats how you call a gold digger in a politically correct way  to not be insulting.\n\nThat has nothing to do with a dictionnary definition.\n\nWhen you say \"huh she's .... nice\" when a friend asks for your opinion on a girl to not say she is stupid with that pause before nice.   But you'll never find nice under stupid in the dictionnary, bud.", "Dictionary definitions exist and they are used. The context materialistic is being used in suggests that a dictionary definition was meant. If the conflict was over, say, him using her for the expensive things she bought him, then it would be logical to assume materialistic was PC code for golddigger."]}
