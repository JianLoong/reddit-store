And I really have no words about the rest of the family, seriously what the hell??", "NTA, you noticed your nephew was being neglected.  Sis and fiance are doing drugs in front of him and generally not being parents.  You are in no way TA.  Heck, you could have sent him to foster care, but you stepped up instead.", "NTA.\n\nYour nephew clearly needed out of that abusive situation", "NTA\nYou\u2019ve saved tht kid from a horrible future.

What you did was see a child being neglected, tried to resolve this with Sister and her BF with no success because of them, and then taken action to protect that child from them.\n\nThe fact that people are making you question yourself shows their complete lack of common sense and morals, not any failing on your part.\n\nJust be sure when they get to trial and everything comes to light that you hold those people to account when they inevitably try to sweep it under the rug.", "God bless you man, fuck anyone who neglects their child.", "Yikes, NTA!

You protected a kid who needed protection.  \n\nThe people that are blaming you are very very wrong.  They are enablers, enabling the abuse of that child.  \n\nIt's not wrong to hold people accountable for their horrible behaviors.

Of course neglect is awful and they should\u2019ve been dealt with anyway, but if you were doing it more for jealousy purposes and helping the kid was more of a bonus that would change things.", "NTA\u2026. holy fucking fuck. First, great job being a loving adult to care for a child that\u2019s not yours and keep them fed and as safe as possible. Second, I\u2019d have called the cops too. The fact that your family is treating you like this tells me that they are being toxic here and highly dysfunctional. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, however please know that you did the right thing, and I pray your sister gets help and rehab and comes back on top and thanks you someday. Do right by your nephew as you are\u2026 he will always appreciate having a safe place he knows is always there. You are a saint\u2026 the world needs more people like you.", "NTA.

Best of luck on long term plans for the two of you.", "So it sounds like the reasons your sister and her boyfriend got arrested were that they \"went ballistic\" when you confronted them about their parenting style and you agreed to press charges over what was, essentially, a domestic violence situation? Gosh, NTA there. If they're that unstable, they could have unleashed that fury on your poor nephew at any time (and likely had.) Additional charges were probably added for any drugs they might have found on the premises when they investigated the neglect complaint (a separate issue. ) \n\nYou saved your nephew and hopefully your sister too.\n\nWhen people turn a blind eye to their sick relatives and enable addictive behavior to escalate unchecked, they're really just showing how little they care about that person. The hardest abs most painful thing you can do is love them enough to lock them up and risk alienation in hopes that it will be the wake up call they need to nudge them into recovery. As I told my stepdaughter, \"I'd rather have you be alive and never speaking to me again by choice than dead and not speaking to me because you can't.\" She is recovering and speaking to me.", "NTA\u2026.please document everything about these parents and interactions with your nephew. Also please do not let your family who is saying you\u2019re jealous because you cannot have children\u2026.that is absolutely deplorable. I will tell you that if your in the US and the police took your sis and partner into custody and gave you emergency guardianship then they FOUND REALLY BAD THINGS. \n\nHere is why you\u2019re NTA:\n\nA. A minor child has to go to you on a regular basis because they ARE NOT FEEDING HIM!!!\n\nB. They acted in a way that police arrested them and are STILL IN JAIL WAITING TRIAL\u2026..they either can\u2019t afford bail or more than likely have had that option revoked.\n\nC. Your family IGNORED MAJOR CHILD ABUSE and are calling YOU THE ASSHOLE FOR GIVING A CRAP ABOUT THE SAFETY OF A CHILD. Moreover your FAMILY. \n\nD. You\u2019re literally the only one who advocated for a defenseless child.\n\nNow YWBTA if:\n\nA. You let your family near this child. They WILL badmouth you to them. They WILL try to paint these neglectful and abusive parents as having made a \u201cmistake\u201d and how they should be forgiven.\n\nB. Allowing any of them unsupervised time with their child if the parents do make bail. They WILL abscond with their child and disappear and if they do all of their behaviors when they aren\u2019t hiding it will get so much worse when they are hiding.\n\nC. You don\u2019t write down everything as far back as you remember and get copies of the police reports and criminal charges and any evidence(photos, documents,reports,etc) and put them all together. Create a \u201cfamily album\u201d with all of it so that any time anyone says YTA, you can look at all of that and at your nephew and remember why you\u2019re THE BEST AUNT EVER!!! And you can also show it to everyone and very slowly explain. Or ask questions in non specifics such as I came across a case where a child was treated xyz way what would you do, have them comment on all of it and then when they bring up how they would let allow blah blah blah then show them the file. Let their brains break. \n\nD. If you ever doubt yourself and instincts again. You\u2019re amazing and I\u2019m so glad someone is taking care of this poor child. I don\u2019t know how old you are but I\u2019m so glad you have more emotional and intellectual intelligence than apparently you\u2019re entire ostrich like family(maybe you should ask if the sand is really warm down where their heads are?)", "NTA. You saved your nephew\u2019s life from his parents and actually from the rest of your family when they thought you\u2019re wrong here.", "If they're still in custody then obviously something is going on but swearing doesn't make you a bad parent, drinking (one or 2 not being drunk), doesn't make you a bad parent and smoking (as long as it's not hard drugs or in the kids face) doesn't make you a bad parent. Neglecting your child makes you a bad parent though.", "Nta. Wow your family is full of people who are enablers. How they let their family member be neglected and berate the person who took them after being blown up on. I would distance myself from them all honestly. Take care of your nephew and be safe.", "NTA They wouldn't have given you temporary custody and placed them in custody if it was because you were jealous. They did this for the welfare of the child because mom and dad have a problem.   \n\n\nDon't listen to what other people are saying. The facts speak for itself.", "NTA! Keep that poor kid away from the whole family that thinks you\u2019re being an AH. They don\u2019t care about that kid.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for your nephew.", "Nta but they all are. You did it for ur nephews  wellbeing  if u had done nothing  and some serious  had happened  to him u are the one who would  have  to live with the guilt", "NTA\n\nThis is a \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d situation in the eyes of your family. You\u2019ve called the authorities and got them in trouble which, according to your family you did cause your jealous. (Insert headache inducing eye room) \n\nHOWEVER - if your nephew would have gotten hurt or permanently injured or even killed, it would have been your fault for not same something sooner. \n\nYour family sucks and I say to hell with all of them. You did the right thing for your nephew. Good job!", ">So, my sister and her boyfriend have a kid, however they\u2019re always doing drugs, smoking, drinking and swearing in-front of him, I live next-door to them and more often than not he would knock on my door in the evening for food \n\nHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahah nta. Don't need to read further.", "NTA. You protect that child and your from them. Tell all those Who said you the A that they can Talk to the police and ask why they were arrested. If they are good parents and dont doit nothing wrong they were in their House with the kid. Please, CUT ALL THESE PEOPLE FROM YOUR LIFE. If theyre ok with the neglicence with the kid, theyre are not god persons and never are gonna suport you.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it sounds like your parents have put your sister is \"The Golden Child\" and will side with her no matter what she's done. Well done and thank you for getting your nephew away from her and her partner.", "If everyone she is asking is telling her she is the AH, she needs better people in her life!", "THIS!", "For real. She sounds horrible and OP is a better mother figure than she is to her own child.", "It\u2019s tricky because my sister was mislead by her fianc\u00e9 In my opinion, I believe she could be rehabilitated as she only became the way she is when she met her boyfriend, who has always been like this. After some thinking I might try and testify on behalf of my nephew, for his dad to serve time and my sister to go to rehab. Could be controversial to not try and have my sister badly punished but from what my nephew has said most bad things stemmed from his father", "I meant swearing at the kid, drinking heavily and smoking indoors.", "It\u2019s not hard to see how your sister ended up this way since your family is okay with them abusing your nephew. I would also consider getting new friends.", "I think that you would be smart to testify to the pattern of behavior. At least in the US CPS really does try to reunite families and reinstate guardianship to parents who follow programs and steps and change their behavior. If your sister is better without her partner then she will be able to gain back custody rights up to and including full custody being restored. It may take many times of trying and failing for your sister to get help with her addiction problems and from my guess ptsd/trauma/abuse healing and therapy. She also will probably have to take parenting classes and get support from other government programs including safe housing, bill assistance, therapy, rehab, etc\u2026. All of these will help her navigate challenges and critical thinking. \n\nThis is a really hard situation but please remember what the end goal of all of this is\u2026\u2026the welfare of a child. And if he is old enough(if you\u2019re not familiar with how to word convos for different ages on these sensitive topics I\u2019d highly recommend finding a therapist for you and the kiddo. That way you can gain the necessary tools to creating a supportive environment and build a rapport with a therapist so when the inevitable land mines of puberty and complex feelings and unstable upbringing come up you have someone in the working together team category as an informed and trusted neutral third party. CPS should have talked to you about this or reach out to them about this if you\u2019re in the US. This also means that the courts will advocate for them in court for THEIR well-being and be in the kids corner. \n\nI hope this helps a bit.", "Then you are correct all of the above are completely unacceptable. I can't stand when parents swear at their kids\ud83e\udd2c. Smoking indoors is just gross the smell stays on EVERYTHING and drunk people get annoying (especially when it's constant). You did the right thing.", "Oh also if your sister was misled by her partner then she really needs help in learning boundaries and how to advocate for HER CHILD. That does include not allowing someone to mistreat her and allowing her child to have the example of it being ok for partners to abuse, mistreat, and help provide the environment for addiction. These are also lessons children learn growing up. How they should be treated by the people who say/should \u201clove\u201d them. This will teach a child how love is given and received. Think along the lines of, spare the rod, spoil the child\u2026.just because someone says they love you doesn\u2019t mean they can abuse you in the name of love.\n\nEdited for typo***"]}
