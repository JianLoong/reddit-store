I confronted my sister and her now fianc\u00e9 about this and they went ballistic. I went home and called the police (when I said ballistic it was because what they did I can\u2019t share on this sub) and my sister and her fianc\u00e9 were taking into custody. It\u2019s been about 3 months and they\u2019re still awaiting trial, my nephew has been staying with me for the past 2 and a half months after the authorities allowed me to be his temporary carer. My parents and the rest of my family have refused to speak to me and are convinced that I am jealous of my sister and her fianc\u00e9 for having a kid of their own since I\u2019m infertile, totally ignoring the neglection. Some of my friends think I was in the wrong even though the police have found some sort of evidence. I\u2019m quite certain that I am not the A***hole but I\u2019ve been told I am by enough people for me to begin questioning my own judgement and even feeling guilty.\nSo please tell me, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671225356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znpbxm/aita_for_having_my_sister_and_her_fianc\u00e9_arrested/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thanks for sounding like the only person who has your nephew\u2019s best interests at heart. Someone clearly needs to\u2026. \n\nNTA", "The kid was literally knocking on your door for food, probably very confused as to why his parents don't love him or care about him. You did the right things. Let them rot in there.", "NTA you did what is right.  Everyone else is doing what is easy by closing their eyes and pretending nothing bad will happen if they do nothing.", "You woulda been the asshole if you DIDN'T have them arrested! \n\nSo obviously NTA. And I really have no words about the rest of the family, seriously what the hell??", "NTA, you noticed your nephew was being neglected.  Sis and fiance are doing drugs in front of him and generally not being parents.  You are in no way TA.  Heck, you could have sent him to foster care, but you stepped up instead.", "NTA.\n\nYour nephew clearly needed out of that abusive situation", "NTA\nYou\u2019ve saved tht kid from a horrible future. The parents clearly don\u2019t give an F about their children and it\u2019s nice he has someone to care for.", "NTA-They got themselves arrested. You are protecting your nephew and doing what is best for him.", "NTA. What you did was see a child being neglected, tried to resolve this with Sister and her BF with no success because of them, and then taken action to protect that child from them.\n\nThe fact that people are making you question yourself shows their complete lack of common sense and morals, not any failing on your part.\n\nJust be sure when they get to trial and everything comes to light that you hold those people to account when they inevitably try to sweep it under the rug.", "God bless you man, fuck anyone who neglects their child.", "Yikes, NTA! What the hell is wrong with your family not seeing the real problem?", "You did the right thing!", "NTA.   Something incriminating was obviously found that warrants a trial.  You did the right thing.  Everyone should be thanking you profusely for letting the nephew live with you and not end up in the system.", "NTA.  The hero.  You protected a kid who needed protection.  \n\nThe people that are blaming you are very very wrong.  They are enablers, enabling the abuse of that child.  \n\nIt's not wrong to hold people accountable for their horrible behaviors.  What's wrong is pretending that the abusive behaviors weren't happening, like your parents and these other people are doing.  They are so very wrong, and they are the reason that abusers keep on abusing.", "NTA", "NTA any person who puts the safety and well-being of a child first will never be an asshole. Your sister, her fianc\u00e9 and the rest of your family are the AH.", "NTA - the kid doesn\u2019t need to be in that situation, the kid deserves better.  It\u2019s going to be a fight to give that kid a life he deserves, but I hope you can stick it out and protect him when it looks like none of the other adults in his life will.  Good luck to you.", "NTA - you did a good thing by standing up for your nephew. Your family sucks for ignoring his situation.", "Easy NTA", "NTA", "NTA \nyou were helping a kid that needed help, no matter what your family says, your nephew needed you and you  came through.", "NTA - There's nothing about your sister to be jealous about.", "NTA.  If the rest of your family doesn't like it, they should volunteer to care for/foster the child.  It should be obvious that the child shouldn't be in a home alone with his bioparents.", "NTA", "Yup your the asshole. Who in their right mind would look out for the best interests of a child? To not want this child taken care of by totally irresponsible grown up. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. Some of your friends need to be some of your ex friends. If your family wants to be this accepting of child neglect then they can be your ex family too. Have your family not yet figured out there are more ways to have children than by giving birth to them? You didn't plot to steal your nephew. You saved a kid who was in a terrible situation.", "NTA but was there ANY jealousy? Of course neglect is awful and they should\u2019ve been dealt with anyway, but if you were doing it more for jealousy purposes and helping the kid was more of a bonus that would change things.", "NTA\u2026. holy fucking fuck. First, great job being a loving adult to care for a child that\u2019s not yours and keep them fed and as safe as possible. Second, I\u2019d have called the cops too. The fact that your family is treating you like this tells me that they are being toxic here and highly dysfunctional. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, however please know that you did the right thing, and I pray your sister gets help and rehab and comes back on top and thanks you someday. Do right by your nephew as you are\u2026 he will always appreciate having a safe place he knows is always there. You are a saint\u2026 the world needs more people like you.", "NTA. If the police found enough evidence to take them to trial then that's their fault.i hope you're taking good care of their kid.", "NTA and screw the people telling you that you did something wrong. Too many people clutch their pearls over getting authorities involved in instances of abuse and neglect, and too many children spend their childhood in hell because of it.\nGood job and keep protecting that child!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
