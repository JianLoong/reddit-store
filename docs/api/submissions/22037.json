And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve experienced something like this throughout your life, but our families also like to use that familial obligation to guilt trip us into doing what they ask. But I will say that a large reason for this entitlement (even if it\u2019s not okay) is because of our collectivist cultures, that because \u201cit takes a village,\u201d if one person is successful, we\u2019re all successful and therefore should share in your (monetary) successes. Even if you did all the work. They think because they played a(n indirect) role in your success as your family they should partake in it. \n\nAlso this is scholarship money, something that\u2019s technically supposed to be used for school & related expenses (even though most agencies won\u2019t check what you use it for). They should understand that with how expensive school is, that you\u2019d want to prioritize money toward that.\n\nIn the future, either don\u2019t tell them the dollar amount or don\u2019t tell them of things like this at all if you wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand their bugging for more details. It\u2019s easy to second guess yourself because you have so many people against you, but stand firm! You\u2019re not alone and you\u2019re doing the best thing for you.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t obvious already, NTA.", "No, NTA.\n\nYou are thinking ahead and looking to be prepared for surprise expenses.\n\nYour family wants you to spend 25% of this award on a meal? What? That's insane. \n\nI would think that they should treat YOU for the award.", "NTA . tell them that the money is to pay for the student loan.", "NTA. Your family are AH's, just looking to mooch off you. If they were pleased, they would treat you, not the other way around.\n\nJust enjoy the silent treatment, and don't respond.", "NTA- stop telling your family and friends about your money from now on. Like never mention your finances again. No one should know what you make, what you have or are getting. No one should have access to your accounts. Get all the way grown and take charge of your life.", "No you\u2019re not being stingy. I don\u2019t tell my parents how much money I have for this exact reason", ">and it costs a good 25% of the award money.\n\nWow.  NTA definitely.\n\nPretty poor form by your parents to even suggest it.  The silent treatment and whinging is extremely childish too.  Parents who view their children as a meal ticket, in this case literally,  are not doing good parenting.", "NTA...That's not what the money is intended for.  Simply say no, or you will be used as a bank machine for the rest of your adult life.", "NTA\n\nIt's for schooling.  Period.  \n\nIt's an absolutely unacceptable request to spend any of that money.", "NTA, Good Heavens! That scholarship is for your education, a long term investment in your life. A fancy meal is a few hours of indulgence and a bit of showing off; when it is over, nothing is left but regrets. Treat your family when you have the stable income to do so.", "NTA\n\nDont spend your money for this!\n\nYour education is fare more importent as some food for your family.", "NTA - why would anyone expect you to spend scholarship money (aka money that is supposed to go toward school) on a fancy meal?? That\u2019s pretty damn entitled of them", "NTA, but why not pay off the loan early, that will take all the pressure off. You received a scholarship for school, shouldn't the whole thing be used for school?", "NTA - You got the money to assist with your education, and thats where it should be going.  Now if you go and blow it on some random luxury item because \"Hey, free money\", you still wouldn't technically be an a-hole, but it would be more iffy lol", "NTA by my standards, but what do I know about your family's cultural expectations and customary behavior? I would think different \"Asian households\" would handle this differently? There are so many different Asian cultures. I can't tell from the context defined as \"Asian household\" whether their reaction to your reaction is culturally justified or they are particularly rude. For my money -- no pun intended -- their request for a super expensive treat is so presumptuous and greedy that ignoring and not addressing it seems like the mature way to go, silently but firmly setting a boundary. If it was my in-laws, I could definitely tell that this behavior supports my view of them as assholes.", "Asian here. \n\nThe scholarship is for you to use towards your studies.   \nMy family was happy for me when I got scholarships. I was treated to some bbq. \n\nAFTER I graduated and got a job, I treated my family to a very nice meal to celebrate and thank them for supporting me.

Your family is ridiculous.  Enjoy the silent treatment.", "Thank you for that insight."]}
