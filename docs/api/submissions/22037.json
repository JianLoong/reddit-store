It means I will have less to repay of my loan which is far larger  than the scholarship...  \n.. I thought you\u2019d be pleased to hear I\u2019d be less in debt, not that you\u2019d want to add to my debt. It\u2019s not restaurant money, I am still a poor student in debt\u201d", "NTA. tell them as soon as they pay your student loans in full you are taking them out to the restaurant and use this money. \n\n\nThis isn't a lottery winning and even if it was the first thing you do is pay your debts before spending money on frivolous things like a meal in a restaurant.", "It kinda depends on the \u201cvillage\u201d in question too. In some families, extended family members may have contributed to the child\u2019s success too. Like older cousins tutoring the younger ones, uncles helping to pay for extra classes, aunties providing daycare so parents can work for more income, older siblings helping to vet college applications, etc\n\nDepending on how much the \u201cvillage\u201d contributed to OP\u2019s upbringing, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to say that one person\u2019s success is everyone\u2019s success. Collectivist culture can be toxic and burdensome, but it can also highly benefit the members in it, depending on whether your relatives are the generous or horrible kind.", "Hm, I would say that\u2019s definitely the case in wealthy Asian households.\n\n\nLower income though, I think there is an expectation that any money and good fortune earned becomes family money", "NTA\n\nTell them it was a mistake.  You weren't actually awarded the scholarship... and never tell them anything about your financial situation ever again.", "\"Hey sorry I've already put that money towards my student loan so its already gone. Happy to catch up sometime soon for coffee though?\"", "That money\u2019s for your loan, not for a dinner. NTA for putting it in the bank and keeping it there. Ignore your family. They can\u2019t demand a treat, they can only accept or refuse one when offered it.", "After this particular incident, I wouldn't treat them at all", "In my experience, they don't ask you to account for every dollar spent. But as long as I was receiving a scholarship, I wasn't allowed to work more than a set number of hours per week (more or less the amount of time it would take one to teach a class). The scholarship was there to allow me to not have to worry too much about living expenses while I was taking classes and writing my thesis, and also to help me attend any relevant conferences. So I guess he probably could treat his family, but it would be a really stupid decision. And they're greedy AHs for even asking.", "This money is for your education, nothing else. Explain that to them. It's not money you can spend, it's already been spend. Edit: Forgot to add NTA at the end.", "Asian culture also demands that you manage finances responsibly and pay off loans before extravagant expenses, so don't let your fam use that as an excuse for sure."]}
