But I will say that a large reason for this entitlement (even if it\u2019s not okay) is because of our collectivist cultures, that because \u201cit takes a village,\u201d if one person is successful, we\u2019re all successful and therefore should share in your (monetary) successes. Even if you did all the work. They think because they played a(n indirect) role in your success as your family they should partake in it. \n\nAlso this is scholarship money, something that\u2019s technically supposed to be used for school & related expenses (even though most agencies won\u2019t check what you use it for).
