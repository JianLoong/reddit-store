That's AH.\n\nLook, you're allowed to use your money as you see fit. Your children aren't entitled to your money. However, if you show favoritism, you are going to ruin your relationship with the not favorite child/ren.\n\nYTA because of what you said", "WOW YTA holy shit. I don't like your wife and you know it l. Wow wow wow you are definitely an asshole and TA", "YTA\nNot because you're paying for the wedding, but for treating your other son like that. No wonder your dil doesn't like you.", "I laughed so hard with this post! Thanks OP!", "Let's say your sons were named A and B. It will be easier for me to explain.\n\n<You paid for A's wedding but not for B's one, because you prefer A's fianc\u00e9e more? I mean, it's your money, but isn't this the definition of \"favoritism\"?>\n\nI overlooked quite an important fact. A's paid wedding was his second wedding. He had a first wedding with someone else before. B had only one wedding, and is still with his wife now, and like one of the responses to my comment said, his wife from 18 years (this will be important later). There's no favoritism, not between A and B at least.\n\nB has no reason at all, thus, to tell that OP shows favoritism to A over himself, because this is simply not true!\n\nEven my point that he said that \"he will pay for his next wedding\" being disrespectful is not really the truth. It may be like the other Y T A comments said: \"He said that because he wanted B to divorce from his current wife\". But it could also be misinterpreted, and just be: \"if there's an another wedding, I'll pay for it, like I've done for A\"\n\nAnother thing to mention: B has been with his wife from 18 years! In 18 years, things can change drastically (for example, the family's financial outcome). Since the first day, B's wife was cold and quite harsh, and that's why OP don't like her.\n\nSo, to resume everything I've now said, the reasons why OP didn't pay for B's wedding at that time are the following:\n\n1/ OP don't like B's wife, because she's cold and harsh, thus he doesn't approve their relationship (I will come into it later)\n\n2/ It was B's first wedding, it would be unfair for him to pay B's first (and maybe only) wedding when A's first wedding wasn't paid.\n\n3/ It's been 18 years since B's wedding. 18 years! Like I said, things change in that many time! Maybe, in that time, they didn't have enough money to help financially for the wedding!\n\nThe only point OP was the AH in that situation (he's still a big AH though in that case) is that he doesn't approve a 18+ years relationship, and the wedding, because he doesn't like B's wife. How not liking someone in the relationship can make you disapprove a marriage that long? B and his wife are together since maybe I was born (I am 22), and you still didn't approve that? Did you gave him at least a shred of support? It's more than just money here, in fact, it's respect for your son!\n\nI'm still on the YTA side, but for a whole different reason now. B is still a bit of an AH for the favoritism part, at least about the financial part, but nothing as major as OP. So, my verdict stays YTA, not E S H.", "YTA simply because they\u2019re your kids; unfortunately you\u2019re not really allowed to play favorites with your kids even if you have justifiable reasoning.
