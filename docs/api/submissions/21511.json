We are the only people at the company who can do what we do. Debbie recently revealed to our employer that she is expecting a baby January of next year & that her pregnancy is considered high risk. \n\nMy boss is a good guy, but he is a hands off manager in general & particularly hands off in our dept since he can\u2019t do what we do. His response to Debbie\u2019s news was that the 2 of us need to work out coverage for doctors appointments & maternity leave.\n\nNormally, I\u2019m an accommodating person & wouldn\u2019t mind carrying extra weight for a pregnant coworker, but I strongly dislike Debbie. She started working here 3 weeks before me & has really latched onto the idea that she has seniority over me & acts like she is my supervisor. This means she often gives me unsolicited criticism on my work & feels entitled to comment on my schedule (e.g. claiming timing off \u201cwon\u2019t work for [her]\u201d, insisting that she get priority for time off around holidays, etc.). \n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve considered looking for a job where I wouldn\u2019t have to work so closely with such a jerk, but it can be hard to find work in our field in this area & my financial situation required me to work. The issue with Debbie never caused a big problem, so I stuck it out.\n\nHowever, within a couple hours of my boss telling us to work it out, Debbie\u2019s behavior (e.g. telling me when I would need to cover her doctor\u2019s appointments regardless of my plans, talking about me working OT, telling me I might need to reschedule a New Years vacation I have planned, etc.) was driving me up a wall. When I went home that night I realized I couldn\u2019t deal with months of this. My financial situation has changed, & I no longer need to work. So I decided to give my notice & take a few months/a year before finding another job.\n\nAfter I gave my notice, Debbie started interrogating me about my plans, & she was pissed when I said I was taking some time to myself. She didn\u2019t speak to me for the rest of the day. When I shared this story with friends, they all thought I was a jerk putting Debbie in this position to avoid a few months of inconvenience.\n\nFor context, the US-based business we work for is small enough we aren\u2019t protected by discrimination laws or FMLA. Our boss won\u2019t fire her or anything because he is a good guy, & he will give her time for maternity leave & appointments. But he will probably need to hire a temp, which will mean Debbie\u2019s schedule will have less flexibility, she will probably need to work some longer hours leading up to maternity leave, & she might need to take less time off after giving birth. Additionally, a lot of our compensation comes from bonuses for completed projects. There\u2019s almost no way for a temp worker to be as productive, so she will probably lose out on some bonuses.\n\nSo AITA for not toughing it out for a few months to help out a pregnant coworker when doing so wouldn\u2019t really cost me anything?", "created_utc": 1688674068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sk8np/aita_for_screwing_over_my_pregnant_coworker/", "score": 593, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But this is something he should have oversight of.\n\nNTA.  So much unnecessary window dressing in this post.  Nobody is an AH for leaving a job ever.

Instead she acted entitled to your time and found out what happens when you treat people poorly.  Oh well!", "NTA. At all. Her pregnancy is not your responsibility regardless of whether she treated you well or not, but it's especially offensive to treat you with such disrespect and then *demand* that you bend to her life and her schedule. How can she expect that, save out of pure narcissism? You're not her friend, you're her coworker. If the success of her pregnancy depended on you, she's not in a place to get pregnant. You're not her friggin midwife. Go work wherever will hire you and you're fulfilled; that's your right.", "NTA. Your company is responsible for its staffing needs - that\u2019s not on you.  They have time to find a temp your coworker can train", "NTA, she dished it, it's time she started eating. When you know you'll  have to be accomodated by a coworker, you make sure for it to be as painful as you can. She, on the other hand, decided you owe her smth, lol. Now she needs to deal with the result of her own actions. You are nowhere to blame", "NTA. You need to look out for yourself. Your company is not your family.

And your boss shouldn\u2019t be pawning all of this off on you, because he needs to start planning for when she takes time off after having the baby.

Your boss is a loser, what is he paid for anyway?", "nta... she took advantage of you for so long,... she will now miss you.", "NTA\n\nNo need to light yourself up to keep Debbie warm.", "NTA This wouldn't only be for a few months.

Her baby got sick, she can't come in today, but you can handle one day of work by yourself, right? Oh no she can't come tomorrow, she doesn't know if the baby feels better, she needs some extra day off sorry. She has a really important appointment, can you reschedule your vacation?

And you have every right to leave a job which treats you poorly, you're under no obligation to stay to cover for Debbie even if she wasn't a horrible coworker. \n\nHer being such a nightmare gives you even more justification to leave because she can't expect to treat people like that and get her way, and your boss should really have stepped up and made sure it wouldn't put an unfair burden on you to have to make up for Debbie - he might be a good guy but to be honest he doesn't sound like a very good manager.

I maybe saying this from a brits point off view but when I was pregnant I told my manager my appts and they covered them I shouldn't have to find cover or organise with other staff that's literally a mangers job. My pregnancies where both high risk. i had weekly scans and glucose test plus weekly midwife appts and baby classes I missed about 2 to 3 days a week the majority of the time.  it's not acceptable to expect other employees to figure it out. You are not the arsehole for looking after yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to support Debbie or give any shits about her work schedule. It\u2019s the owners job to make accommodations for her pregnancy. \n\nGood for you for leaving.", "You say it wouldn\u2019t cost you anything to stay but you\u2019re undervaluing your sanity and peace of mind.  NTA", "Nope she deserves it for treating you like crap from the beginning", "I didn't see the part where her pregnancy was your choice or responsibility.\n\nMy coworkers are people I respect and we do often cover one another ad-hoc but it is reciprocated and never unanswered. I'd walk away in the same circumstances you are.\n\nIf the business wants you to be flexible or provide cover beyond your notice period, they can pay a consultancy rate and on the premise that you can walk away at any time.\n\nNothing personal - just business.\n\nNTA.", "NTA its not your job or your coworkers job to figure out how the job gets done while shes on maternity leave - your boss is not doing their job, blame him!", "NTA.\n\nListen, if there's only two people on staff who can do what you do, and the business relies on you to keep operating, wtf does your boss think he's doing by not having backup plans? You giving notice of departure is actually a better scenario for the business than you being expected to cover absolutely every day for three months of Debbie's leave and needing unscheduled time off (which is the inevitability your boss was absolutely setting up). \n\nYou wouldn't be helping Debbie out by staying, you'd be helping the business. The same business that is making no plans to help you (generally, if I have a doctor's appointment, work can suck it up, I'm taking it, and someone should be making lines of authority clear and making sure you and Debbie have what you need, like the ability to plan a dental cleaning or a vacation), or to manage this leave appropriately (by discussing how to cross train other employees to cover, hiring a dedicated coverage person, or otherwise making sure that if your appendix ruptures or you get hit by a bus, no one will be up shit creek).\n\nSo the business is badly managed, and that is not your fault. Now that you've given notice, it's also not your problem. They can figure their shit out, as businesses do every day, or go under, as businesses also do every day. Especially ones that are run by idiots.", "NTA for leaving. \n\nWhat about offering to come back when she's on maternity leave to cover her, top up your coffers after 8ish months off and get to work without her being a pain in the butt?", "NTA.  Actions have consequences, Debbie.", "NTA - the boss said you would work together, but Debbie wasn\u2019t working \u201c together \u201c she was dishing out orders.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t there to make friends. It\u2019s a business continuity risk to only have two people able to do a job. Debbie is reaping what she sowed.", "Nta.  You're not leaving because she's pregnant, but because she's a bully.  By design, everyone reaps what they sow - if not now, later.  They may have to hire someone with more experience, which would cost more.", "Nta \n\nYou owe your coworker jack. It\u2019s up to your boss and her to figure it out.", "NTA", "NTA - jobs are employment at will, and between the entitled coworker and the boss unable or unwilling to manage the situation professionally, noping out of there is a totally reasonable decision, especially if you are able to just give notice.  People stay for people typically, not for love of a particular corporation.  People also leave bad managers and situations.  You're just smart enough to see what's coming and lucky enough to gtfo.", "nta you evade a bullet", "Absolutely not the asshole. From the details you have presented it appears you have done enough for her already. I can easily Imagine someone like Debbi calling you while she is on maternity leave asking if this this and this has been done. Do not give her your contact details when you leave only give them to the boss with the instructions that \u201c they (boss) is only person to contact you and only in an emergency\u201d if that\u2019s of interest to you. In my experience imbeciles like Debbi never ever learn they just move onto the next sucker. All they want is to feel in control as they live worthless, meaningless and miserable existences and that control over others gives them some sort of hope and comfort. That is why it\u2019s best to refuse to deal with idiots like her! Good luck OP, you done good. Good forward and proposer!", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole necessarily, but I think if you\u2019d spoken to your employer about the issue it might have been resolved for you.", "Hands off doesn\u2019t mean he is a good boss. Sounds like he maybe needed to be hands on with Debbie when you started working there. \n\nSecond of all, you are allowed to resign if you are miserable working with her. Boss can hire someone else. Not a big deal. Not your problem. \n\nNTA", "I mean, if your financial situation allows it, good on you, but did you even bring up your issues with your boss?", "NTA.  Your coworker is finally going to get what she wanted.  They are going to hire a temp and she can boss them around.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't make the baby. Why are you responsable for her and has to endur this?", "NTA. YOU didn't put Debbie in this position, Debbie did.", "I am so happy that you were in a good spot that you could leave and not put up with the work nonsense! Enjoy the time off :) \n\nNTA", "NTA it's called at will employment", "NTA", "NTA. You have to do what's best for you OP. Debbie is a coworker and definitely not your friend. She will be OK after you leave your job. Enjoy your time off OP!", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to be nice to a skunk.", "NTA.\nYou could explain to your boss that you're leaving due to a toxic workplace situation, a lack of leadership that could have prevented it from developing, and an entitled, bullying colleague, however I don't think it will help so that's probably not worth the time.\n \nNot sure why your friends want you to put up with it. That seems odd. Is there more to this story?  Do they know Debbie?", "First you don\u2019t owe an employer or even a co-worker anything. They can try to guilt you all they want but just like they can fire you almost any reason, you can quit for almost any reason.  \n\nIf your former boss really wants a \u2018why\u2019 tell him the truth.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your boss probably should have considered adding a 3rd person already - who else was going to cover for Debbie during her actual maternity leave? It's not on you to save her workload - its up to the business owner.", "Pregnancy is not a free pass to be a jerk or do whatever you want, disregarding other people\u2019s time and needs. \n\nYour friends are probably reacting solely to her pregnancy status, not the overall picture. \n\nNTA. And maybe get better friends?", "NTA!! She made a choice to become pregnant and being rude to you.", "NTA.  He's just going to have to hire that temp.", "NTA\n\nIf Debbie was somewhat a decent human to you, you wouldn't be quitting your job.\n\nThe fact that you're driven to quit rather than even seeing how the first couple of weeks / months are, suggests that you know how this would work out and are not interested to see that path taken.\n\nAlways look out for numero uno first OP. That means your happiness and comfort come before ANYONE else", "NTA. Debbie sounds insufferable, and your boss is a shit boss. Fuck them both.", "nta she made the job untenable so you left.", "NTA you do not owe loyalty to a company.", "NTA. Your boss is terrible and so is your coworker.  Somehow her life choices are your problem, and she has never been kind to you to begin with?  Nope.   If I was going to need help at work, I would probably start by being very nice to my colleagues.  She never even contemplated that.  Buh bye.", "Sounds like her problem. Nobody is entitled to your labour. She has a shit attitude too\nNTA", "NTA. You don't owe Debbie a years worth of your time, which is what your boss and Debbie are asking of you. You don't have to stay just because they want you to.", "NTA your boss certainly is. Even if you did care for this person you don't have to sacrifice your mental health for something that has nothing to do with you.", "NTA", "NTA. How are you a jerk? You are not her mom, her nanny, her caretaker. You are her colleague. A colleague who decided staying in the job was no longer working for her/him.", "Debbie made her bed. now she gets to lay in it. NTA.", "NTA", ">First and foremost, you have a rubbish boss\n\nThat was my first thought too.  I think the OP should have told him \"Having her dictate to me isn't going work\" as she gave him the resignation.", ">First and foremost, you have a rubbish boss.  Hands off is great for letting people with job knowledge do the job.  Nothing worse than a clueless manager butting in with a lack of expertise.  But this is something he should have oversight of.\n\nExactly.  The boss is hands off but allowed bad blood to create and fester leading to a key employee quitting when one is going on maternity leave.  An employee who felt appreciated bc the problem personality in her group was handled and managed might have stuck it out.  Instead she is left to fend for herself and the result is what we have here.", "THIS. I supervise people and I stay out of their way and let them do what they know to do, but admin/paperwork stuff is all me. That boss should be fired", "I quitted a job after my manager told me to find someone to cover my work, when I was sick with high fever. Add some other things and I had enough. It should never be on coworkers to \u201cfigure it out\u201d! \nOP is NTA and good for her.", "Exactly this. Debbie made her bed with the long-term attitude problem. OP got sick of dealing with it when she leveraged her pregnancy to \u201cjustify\u201d becoming even harder to work with. She fucked around and found out.", "Exactly! These are people you work with. Not your family. You don\u2019t owe her a damn thing. She\u2019d do it to you and wouldn\u2019t spare a second thought. You are a good person for even worrying about this.

And maybe been the Debbie. But the point is that the boss is shitty for being hands off, bc Debbie should have been dealt with a long time ago.

So delusional.", "Was her name Terri? \ud83d\ude01", "Debbie does Dallas?", "You're right. I forgot there was a rule about the number of employees required. The \"I even\" was a bit catty but alrighty.", "aaaand there it is. just because something is not someone\u2019s responsibility doesn\u2019t mean that being vindictive isn\u2019t as asshole thing. our society has gone downhill with this \u201ci don\u2019t owe anyone anything\u201d attitude.", "Exactly this!!

There is a list of reasons why one would not have to be provided FMLA.

Must be fun being perfect lol. Have the day you deserve.", "So they admitted their fault and you decided to double down on being rude.  You must be awesome at the parties you aren't invited to."]}
