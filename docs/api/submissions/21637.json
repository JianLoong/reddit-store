It is a problem if two people are closedly related. But if they were so closely related they will absolutely find out it. I mean, more or less sharing a grandfathr or a grandmother. \nOther than that is no relevant.

While getting a DNA test is probably smart, and your concern is valid, your timing was bad....and insensitive. It should have been mentioned a year ago and now it's a bit too late.

That's fucked up.", "They're second cousins at worst, where it doesn't matter anymore anyway so YTA", "YTA but it\u2019s kind of you to try and have them not have a kid\u2026 like yourself.", "YTA if they are farther than 1st cousins (aka they share granparents) its generally fine.

YTA, good grief.", "YTA, this is beyond ridiculous.\n\nI assume you know for a fact that they do not share a parent or grandparent; that is really all you need to know. There is no state (or to my knowledge country) where it is illegal to marry someone you are related to as long as they are not a parent, grandparent, sibling, or first cousin. In fact in 19 states you can go ahead and marry your first cousin. Even if they are related there is no legal impediment to them marrying, and no moral impediment either as long as it didn't bother them. It's none of your business.\n\nYou'll probably try to claim your unhinged concern is for their hypothetical future kids, but there's a reason it's not illegal to marry people as long as they are not your parent, sibling, or first cousin: the genetic concerns with that are really negligible, and like I already said morally no one but you cares, people accept that past a certain degree of relation, when people didn't know one another as kids, it's not creepy to marry.\n\nGet over yourself before you ruin your relationship with your sister and all other sane members of your family.", "NTA better find out sooner than later but hey if she wants to date her relative that\u2019s her choice", "YTA.

You are an ass for laughing at your dads shitty fucking joke tho and your dad is most definitely an asshole for making it", "NTA.   It used to be the law that you got a blood test to qualify for a marriage license for the specific reason that the state was hoping to avoid birth defects.

Once might\u2019ve been enough, but honestly I probably would\u2019ve done the same\n\nMy sister did this before she started dating her husband because they each had one parent that had the same last name (granted it\u2019s a fairly generic one) and had relatives in counties next to each other.

You said they started dating over a year ago...I bet you they did a DNA test and they are somehow related but they love each other and maybe they already had intercourse so your sister is really playing the card of \"omg its sooo cute we have the same last name!\" Vs \"I know its weird but I promise we're not related\" so it doesn't come out to the town and the families. Cause if I found out I accidentally slept with a family member I would take it to my grave.

An ugly fact, that people don't want to recognize, is there absolutely is a history of cousin marriage. OP themselves mentions polygamy, which indicates it probably was only a few generations ago at most. \n\nIf both the OP's sis and her fiance have a family history of incest AND they are second cousins, their kids are bound to have health problems.", "Op isn't right to be concerned they know who their  parents are and presumably can count to four, to make sure there's four of them and not three.  There's also a really good chance They at the very least know all their grandparents' names.    \n\nIt would be a concern if they were both orphans  but only.the family name was known.", "It matters on where this is.  I have 4 counties within 15 minute drive of my home, and 6 within 25 minutes so... yea.  I would be more inclined to do a family tree than a DNA test though and check if any branches are... connected.", "By different county I mean 15 miles apart in a sparsely populated area.", "Don't condone it, but have you ever noticed how people turn to really shitty jokes to break the awkward silence of some societal misstep?", "The blood test laws pre-date DNA sequencing technology by decades.\n\nIt originally was about testing for syphilis", "Yes, it was to prevent kids from being born with syphilis.  It had exactly nothing to do with DNA or whether the parties were related.\n\nIf sister and fiance were closely enough related for it to matter, OP and the rest of the family would know it already.", "Yep agree- comes from a genuine concern but no need to bring it up again\u2026", "None of those are DNA tests.", "Those tests can't tell anything about problems with future pregnancies.", "And Rh - shots are a thing and have been for at least 30 years. So the blood compatability thing has been handled.", "It has nothing to do with \"compatibility\".  They don't sequence DNA. \nThose tests are entirely to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.  No one wants to see a baby born with syphilis.", "Wow, that statement is a problem.", "In Utah, chances are they\u2019re related even if they had different last names. \ud83e\udd23 My husband and I found out we are 9th cousins after we had been married almost 20 years. Both from rural counties but different last names.", "I\u2019m not a fan of incest, so I was with you on that. But here you\u2019re literally saying you want them to check because you want to know. That\u2019s why YTA. Don\u2019t make your curiosity their problem.", "Then drop it! If it was so close it would cause issues with their kids, you\u2019d already know\u2026. Unless you suspect infidelity on dads part which could cause them to have the same parenting?", "Do you have a family search account? If you know the name/details of the fiance's dead relatives you can check it yourself. But honestly I would just leave it alone. They seem like they're pretty set on this and you're not going to convince them otherwise.\n\nUtah is crazy for this stuff though. Went to school with a kid who was descended from the first wife of one of my polygamist ancestors, I was from the second. Moved into new neighbourhood and found out a neighbour was my dad's second cousin. Did relative finder with my friends and they were all 6th+ cousins :( sad day for us.", "You don\u2019t care but you have now brought it up multiple times even though it has been made clear to you its not something your sister wishes to discuss with you? If you don\u2019t care then you\u2019re just being an AH and intentionally agitating her. Stop being weird.", "I went to high school with a girl with the exact same surname as me - same spelling and everything (and there are several variants for this surname, with mine being one of the less common). No close relation, which was easily established because my grandpa and one of his siblings were the only people from his generation to migrate from Scotland to Australia, and her family had been here for several generations. Coincidences *happen.*", "If there was a family history of genetic disease, I might be a little more understanding, but that seems like something OP would have mentioned. And I agree with you - OP needs to let it go at this point.", "Iceland?", "It\u2019s a concern if multiple generations of close relatives have been intermarrying and having kids. It\u2019s not a concern if two people happen to share one relative several generations removed.", "It's really not a concern if they aren't closer than second cousins.\n\n> Look at the Whitfield family in Virginia.\n\nDo you mean the Whittakers of West Virginia?  If OP's sister and fiance were *that* closely related, everyone in the family would know it.", "Whittaker family. They are very inbred and have extremely rare characteristics.", "You must avoid incest (parents-siblings) and it's better to avoid first cousins (same grand-parents), especially in communities where marriage been cousins is very frequent over several generations. Other than that, there is no real concern for genetics.\nYou should definitely mind your own business instead of implying that they should not be in a relationship. YTA", "So why do you believe they are so closely related (first cousins or closer) that their relationship is an issue? YTA. Get your prurient nose out of their business.", "That\u2019s actually what made it funny to me, it\u2019s like he thought \u201chow can I make it even more awkward so the attention is totally off of my kids\u201d lmao", "I\u2019m not surprised- my grandparents were first cousins. My family has been in the same country for 200 years yet the dna results don\u2019t show any evidence of it.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem when you do it for multiple generations.", "but y ou must care if you keep mentioning it like u suggested in your post.", "They don't care because the odds of it actually affecting their children since they aren't directly related (siblings or parents or parents siblings) and probably aren't even cousins (as you'd think you'd know who your parents siblings kids were) are so low it's statistically insignificant.", "But you made a whole post about how you bring it up to her frequently.", "Why should they care?", "Who cares if they are second or third cousins? Doesn't make a difference. They would still marry and have children's since it's socially acceptable and not a huge genetic risk.\n\nYour \"concern\" sounds more like you taking an active interest in being annoying.", "You don\u2019t have to say everything out loud.\n\nYou can wonder about something in your head and move on. \n\nIt's not your intention to split them up? Great. No act like it.", "Say they are actually 3rd cousins. What possible use could they have from knowing that medically and morally completely irrelevant information? Other than having people around them be weird assholes about it, like you are being already even without knowing anything conclusive.", "Your sister doesn't see things in the same way as you do. You feel you'd have to explore every possible detail of the family lineage, she doesn't.\n\nMost people would be approaching it in the same way as your sister.", "Potentially being related is icky. You keep pointing out that her relationship might be icky. Most people don't want people doing that.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you would want, you've been asked to stop doing something that costs you nothing to stop doing. You should stop.", "I think people wouldn't want to know because they want to be together. Being related would make that impossible. I'd choose getting married and never knowing.", "What IS 'to know'? They do not share a parent or grandparent; they did not grow up together. Any family in their lives is not aware of any relation. At best they can conceivably be what, third cousins? In my case it's literally impossible, but all the same would give no shits if my husband and I found out we were actually third cousins. Like I would feel nothing at all about it; maybe the slightest bit of well that's funny/unexpected.\n\nYou may be unaware of this but DNA tests cost money; they also put your genetic information into the world which is not something all people want. Why should they pay to do something they obviously do not care about, that makes no difference to them, when they don't care and the relation is not close enough to morally or medically matter? From a certain perspective it would actually be an insane thing TO DO. You personally feeling curious is a personal thing that has nothing to do with them or with reality. It is s weird to me that you can't see this.", "In no state is it prohibited for second cousins to marry.", "Me either, I can't imagine many people actually do that. The point was even that close a relationship has very little risk, so the OP almost certainly worrying about nothing.", "Yes you're right, if it was just cousins, or just a family history of incest, they'd be ok most likely but both increases the risk by a lot.", "Well, maybe. Genetics is a bit trickier than that. If cousin marriage was common in their area just a few generations ago there can be all kinds of recessive genes that could be reinforced if the two are related genetically. It's a low risk, but it's happened and will happen again.", "I didn\u2019t know that so thanks, but why say it in front of everyone? That sounds mortifying.", "In other words, close enough that if you were related, you'd know. Why don't *you* take a DNA test and see who shows up on your tree? Honestly, even if they *are* related, it's unlikely they're close enough for it to matter. And if they're in love enough to be getting married, is it really so surprising they're not interested in learning something that could end their relationship? It's not really any of your business. Time to move on.", "Yea and then a lot of the times it makes things even more awkward", "\"The blood test laws pre-date DNA sequencing technology by decades.\"\n\nYes.  Test results are more accurate today.  Which lends more credibility to the argument that a test should be done.", "Why is it a problem? There's nothing wrong with first cousins marrying or having children.", "Not about marriage but I once worked with someone who when he heard my (very unusual) last name told me that it was his brother's first name. Took a look at the family tree (going back to the 1600s) found the common ancestor, and determined that we were, in fact, 14th cousins. 3,500 miles away from where any branch of the family had lived until our generation.\n\nThe weird thing is that while we did not share much in the way of looks, coloring, build etc. he was the spitting image of my great-grandfather (based on daguerrotype).", "Wouldn\u2019t polygamy give a better chance of not being too related even if you do have the same last name?", "Lol this is what I am getting at! I am not concerned about health issues (although we do unfortunately have those on that side of the family) it\u2019s more along the lines of it could be closer than expected and I would want to know.", "I also went to high school with a girl that had the same last name.  Not common but only a letter off from two very common names.  Everyone asked if she was my sister and I didn\u2019t even know her.  Turns out our grandfathers were brothers.  Hers came to the U.S. as a young man and mine died in the Bahamas before I was born.  In fact every single person I have ever met with my last name I am related too.", "First cousins would mean fathers were brothers to have the same last name - highly unlikely 2 legitimate siblings wouldn\u2019t know each other (legitimate if they have the same last names)", "That does sound kinda embarrassing.  As I said, better to do a family tree for them.  In fact, I have a relative that makes family trees as wedding gifts for all their children and the cousin along with incoming spouse for a wedding gift.", "I didn\u2019t give a lot of detail in that. We have a small family consisting of my parents, myself and my wife and sister and her Fianc\u00e9.", "No. \n\nLaws regarding blood tests prior to marriage were on the books decades before we even had ANY version of DNA sequencing. \n\nMarriage blood tests were around as early as the 1930s, possibly even earlier. More than 40 years before we could sequence DNA at all, let alone widespread tests on the public", "My sister visited a friend in the UK.  She had sent a gift earlier and the friend\u2019s husband noticed the last name on the package and got curious.  Turns out he had been looking for a common ancestor with the same last name and  had no record of where or when he died.  The ancestor had ditched an apprenticeship in England and ended up stranded in the Bahamas where he made a life.  The guy was really into genealogy and was excited to find a whole new branch to his family tree.", "YOU would want to know. They don\u2019t. So just stop. Stop being the AH.", "And that's why you are TA!\n\nYour sister already told you \"no\" once, and you brought it up again because you want to see the results.", "How closely do you expect them to be related?", "What else is there beyond health issues? They obviously don't have a familial relationship.", "As gross as it sounds, first cousins having kids isnt a very big issue genetically speaking. When it's multiple generations of it, then it becomes a problem.\n\n\nFrom what you said it sounds like them being first cousins is impossible. Every additional degree of separation reduces risks exponentially.\n\n\nIt could be an issue in the old days where people didn't move around much, but there's little chance of it being an issue now.", "That dose make it a bit better and it does sound like a good idea but I\u2019d say leave it to them. And if you turn out to be right you can say I told you so.", "Are you in Utah? Because I absolutely understand where you are coming from if that's the case.  If both of them already have a history of cousin marriage in their family tree, and then they are like second cousins...those kids are going to have health issues. \n\nPeople are going to drag you for filth, though. And you could have handled it better.", "If they were related closely enough for it to matter, everyone in the family would already know it.", "First cousins means they share a grandparent, one of his parents is siblings with one of her parents. If they know their parents and aunts/uncles and none of those people are the same they are not first cousins.\n\n2nd cousins share a great grand parent.  And so on. op is being asinine because of the name, It doesn't make them anymore likely to be related than they are to anybody else who lives in a small county a few miles away.", "It's only close enough to matter if they're siblings."]}
