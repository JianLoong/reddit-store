At this point, she told me to shut the fuck up and the conversation was over because nobody wants to deal with her. The wedding is in less than three months, and she wants a baby yesterday. \n\nAITA for suggesting they get a DNA test?

It is a problem if two people are closedly related. But if they were so closely related they will absolutely find out it. I mean, more or less sharing a grandfathr or a grandmother. \nOther than that is no relevant.

While getting a DNA test is probably smart, and your concern is valid, your timing was bad....and insensitive. It should have been mentioned a year ago and now it's a bit too late.

That's fucked up.", "They're second cousins at worst, where it doesn't matter anymore anyway so YTA", "YTA but it\u2019s kind of you to try and have them not have a kid\u2026 like yourself.", "YTA if they are farther than 1st cousins (aka they share granparents) its generally fine.

YTA, good grief.", "YTA, this is beyond ridiculous.\n\nI assume you know for a fact that they do not share a parent or grandparent; that is really all you need to know. There is no state (or to my knowledge country) where it is illegal to marry someone you are related to as long as they are not a parent, grandparent, sibling, or first cousin. In fact in 19 states you can go ahead and marry your first cousin. Even if they are related there is no legal impediment to them marrying, and no moral impediment either as long as it didn't bother them. It's none of your business.\n\nYou'll probably try to claim your unhinged concern is for their hypothetical future kids, but there's a reason it's not illegal to marry people as long as they are not your parent, sibling, or first cousin: the genetic concerns with that are really negligible, and like I already said morally no one but you cares, people accept that past a certain degree of relation, when people didn't know one another as kids, it's not creepy to marry.\n\nGet over yourself before you ruin your relationship with your sister and all other sane members of your family.", "NTA better find out sooner than later but hey if she wants to date her relative that\u2019s her choice", "YTA.

You are an ass for laughing at your dads shitty fucking joke tho and your dad is most definitely an asshole for making it", "NTA.   It used to be the law that you got a blood test to qualify for a marriage license for the specific reason that the state was hoping to avoid birth defects.

Once might\u2019ve been enough, but honestly I probably would\u2019ve done the same\n\nMy sister did this before she started dating her husband because they each had one parent that had the same last name (granted it\u2019s a fairly generic one) and had relatives in counties next to each other.

You said they started dating over a year ago...I bet you they did a DNA test and they are somehow related but they love each other and maybe they already had intercourse so your sister is really playing the card of \"omg its sooo cute we have the same last name!\" Vs \"I know its weird but I promise we're not related\" so it doesn't come out to the town and the families. Cause if I found out I accidentally slept with a family member I would take it to my grave.

You normally couldn't spot a kid created of incest in a crowd is what I'm saying. They are of course more likely to have health issues, but not to the extreme people make it out to be. They'll probably have a good quality of life and I think it's a bit harmful how we demonize those kids along with the parents when really their pretty normal person.
