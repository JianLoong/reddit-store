Me and my brother were always very close, after all we grew up together and did all the brotherly things, such as beating up the neigbourhood kids, and getting beat up together just as much, we rode bikes, swam in lakes and rivers, fished, camped, gamed, did everything together. As we grew older, looking for meaning and place in the world, I quickly realized I wanted to be a doctor. I was 4 years younger than my brother, and got into med school right after graduating.  \n\n\n  \ni graduated med school then did 2 years of \"residency\". I made little money and worked much. After those 2 years, I got a job at a large hospital and had a salary of 300K a year. My first year I took care of basic expenses and set a baseline. My brother and I went on some open houses together, and we found an apartment, with perfect location, and perfect interior. 1 con, price. Now, It wouldn't bankrupt me, but it would be somewhat more than reasonable. Well, my brother convinced me to splurge and so I did.  \n\n\n  \nA few years pass by. My brother graduates, and starts residency. He's had a girlfriend whom I know and respect for at least 2 years at this point. All in all a great woman, and a good person. So my brother was more inclined to buy a home. He wanted to buy his home already in his first year of residency. The problem was that he wasnt making much at that particular time. His girlfriend was studying to be a dentist, and couldnt work full time either (perfectly understandable). I thought this was the perfect opportunity, to repay his favour. They spent time finding a home they liked. Amazing house, but very expensive, and my brother doesnt make a lot at this point, so i Co-opt the mortgage. No biggie he'd do the same for me 10 times over, and besides he wont ask me to pay a cent. He had money saved up, so he took care of the bill, my job was essentially to convince the bank.  \n\n\n  \nAt this time his girlfriend dropped out of school. She now wanted to be a housewife. i would too if i could live in that house for free. My brother passed away before he finished his 1st year of residency. Now, Im paying the mortgage for his house, in which his girlfriend resides. I can manage, but barely. I've had to downgrade or stop with most of my hobbies, I dont save a dollar and my investments are at a halt. It bothers me alot. I want to sell that house, free up my money and be comfortable again.  \nIve explained this to her and asked her to move out. She refuses. any time i press it she breaks into tears, and accuses me of hating her, or not loving my brother as if my hearts not broken. I offered to pay 3k monthly for rent, groceries or any other expenses she has to make her life easier. I want to help her for my brothers sake and because i genuinly care. I offered to pay her tuition out of my own pocket IF she goes back to dental school but she refuses.

Just because you love you brother and y\u2019all had a great relationship.. doesn\u2019t mean you owe this woman anything.\n\nIt is heartbreaking for both of you, I am sure. But you do not deserve to barely scrape by just because she refuses to help herself. Life happens, plan\u2019s don\u2019t always go the way you want them to.. she needs to accept that and figure out what to do. And spoiler alert, it isn\u2019t mooch off your late bf\u2019s brother. \n\nI am so sorry for you loss.", "NTA. It's hard losing a sibling or a partner. However, its impacting you negatively and while you may like his girlfriend, you shouldn't feel obligated to pay for her. Know this. You are one of the best brothers alive.

Don't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.", "You are incredibly kind, and patient, as many others have noted. \n\nBut as someone who has done my own share of it, you are also enabling her as she falls deeper into unhealthy patterns. It\u2019s very hard to say no to people who seem to need us, but at the same time, you are reinforcing a learned helplessness, and perhaps even the habits that keep her de-motivated to believe in her own abilities to work and care for herself. \n\nYou have done admirable work of honoring her as a sister-in-law, and perhaps in your mind you have been taking care of your brother\u2019s \u201cwidow\u201d \u2014 but your training as a doctor lets you know she has to exercise all her muscles to regain and keep using them.", "NTA. As others have mentioned, either she takes over the mortgage or you issue an eviction.\n\nBut I would SERIOUSLY consider if paying for all her expenses and possible tuition afterwards is a smart idea long term. Are you certain that removing the mortage only to spend thousands on her instead is going to save you money or allow you to continue your hobbies? I\u2019m just not seeing how it actually solves your dilemma, and according to a comment your brother passed TWO YEARS AGO. You have already done way beyond what would be expected. While very generous to offer, she needs to work and do her part in society just like you and every other capable adult, and tbh she simply is in no position to live as a housewife now.", "Sad situation but NTA.", "NTA in any way.  At this point she is taking advantage of you,, and using the death of your brother in order to do it.  I understand that you feel obligated to take care of her due to the love your brother had for her, but the fact is that as they were not married nor did they have children you are not obligated to continue to care for her.  Another way to look at it is if they broke up, you would not be obligated to support her as the relationship had ended.  In a way the relationship has ended, tragically, but it has ended.  You have done more than necessary for her given the amount of time since your brother passed.  It's time to file for eviction, and sell the house.  She needs to be responsible for herself at this point, and you are also not obligated to support her, or pay for her education after she has moved out.", "NTA.  Don't offer anything, use your money for a lawyer to evict her", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't get to live rent free at your expense.\n\nEither she starts covering the costs or she leaves. If you have the mortgage, start eviction and sell it", "Nta. You need to start legal proceedings to evict her. Your love for your brother doesn\u2019t require you to take care of his girlfriend.", "NTA. She has decided that she likes being taken care of and will continue until, you evict her or she finds another person to float her lifestyle. You offered her compromises, she refused. You've been the 'bigger person.' Now it's time to look out for your interests and get her out so you can sell the place and get on with your life.\n\nAnd I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA. She\u2019s taking you for a ride. It\u2019s been 2 years and she\u2019s guilting you into funding her life. You\u2019d be a fool to let her keep taking advantage of you like this. And quit being a doormat. What is with you offering to give her 3k a month? That\u2019s ridiculous. Contact a lawyer and get her to leave.

The plans she made with your brother are gone and it is necessary for her to find a way to manage without his support.\nI appreciate that you are being very kind but it was not your choice to support someone who decided to be a housewife.

Evict her.", "First of all, OP, I'm sorry for your loss.  I cannot imagine what you're going through right now.\n\nHaving said that, this GF doesn't sound like a nice person.  You're literally lighting yourself on fire to keep a stranger warm.  No point of making bank if you're spending it all just paying off his mortgage.  She's just tugging at your heartstrings, appealing to the brother's ex card, and using crocodile tears.\n\nWhile it's below my pay grade to tell you whether she is trespassing, squatting or whatever, I will say **lawyer up** and set the process in motion at their discretion.\n\nFunny thing is, if she went back to dental school, she likely could just repay whatever you've paid into the house and take over payments.  But I wager she just plans to live off the largess of your good graces in perpetuity.\n\nNTA\n\nETA:  OP, if your brother's ex has been living in that house for TWO years on your dime, evict her NOW.

I get where you\u2019re coming from completely. Not helping her feels weird because obviously your brother wanted a specific life for her/them and you feel like you should find a way to fulfill that where your brother can\u2019t. That\u2019s an understandable emotion. \n\nAs for what I would do, there has to be a limit so you can enjoy your life. I would have a lawyer draw up a contract including an eviction notice. Basically you saying you are selling the house, she needs to be moved out by X date, and you are offering her Y amount of money toward school or living expenses or paid tuition through Z date (by how many credits she has remaining, etcetera). She can take those terms or she can move out with nothing, but she must move out. I say this rather than just kicking her to the curb because I think you\u2019d probably have a hard time with that later. I think based on your information and what you\u2019ve done so far that you need to feel like you\u2019re fulfilling something for your brother to offer her the life they\u2019d planned. \n\nThis way you can know \u201cI tried, I gave her the ability, she chose not to take it but my conscience is clear,\u201d not because you owe her anything. You don\u2019t, but I understand the impulse and a small concession to that desire on your part will likely make you feel better. It also puts a limit on it. She can\u2019t expect a check from you indefinitely to be a lifelong student or whatever. I hope you can soon move on from this.", "ESH. The house might be a reminder of your bother to her. You guys are both grieving, people deal with things differently.\n\nIf there was a way she could pay the mortgage: sell it to her.

Have her removed and sell it.", "I'm very sorry for your loss. \n\nWell this is an interesting situation... she's not a renter because she never paid rent. So does that mean she's a squatter? What does the law say where you live?\n\nPart of her problem is grief, but she'd planned on living off her boyfriend for free well before your brother died. (Was he okay with that?)

Does she have family you could appeal to? \n\nI mean, you have to sell the house. You can put it on the market without her permission, you own it, right? You have a set of keys?

I mean how far along is she in dental school?

Purely financially it would be less than 1/10th of what i pay for the mortgage for the house. Its not a proper solution, its more akin to taking ibuprofen for a headache, not eliminating the root issue.

Legally speaking the situation roughly looks like this: She has no contract, thus legal right of living in the home. My brother was the legal owner of the house, with me being co-owner. As he passed, the house defaults to me, as he has no children. His girlfriend was exactly that, meaning she has no legal rights to his property. So, theoretically I could police her out of the home. I am trying to avoid that however.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for her family, they're all enchanted by the magnitude of the house she lives in and she has essentially convinced them that it's her house that she bought and paid for fairly through idk some business venture?

Would you explain why you say I have no obligation to help her?", "After two years since the brother's passing it's a matter of her using OP as free ride. She wasn't married to the brother.
