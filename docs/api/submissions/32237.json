My hubby \u201cFrank\u201d and I were invited 2 months ago to his sister \u201cKate\u2019s\u201d house for Xmas Eve. By being told by my bro-in-law \u201cPaul\u201d: \u201cXmas Eve is at our house. We\u2019re not going anywhere. Everyone has to come to us.\u201d\nConsidering this was announced months before Christmas, we accepted not realizing that I would also have family events during the holidays to coordinate with. We figured we could have Xmas Day dinner with my parents to make it fair.\nLast week, my aunt invited my entire extended family to her place for a huge Xmas Eve dinner. It broke my heart to say no but we already agreed to go to Kates place and felt wrong backing out. \nFinally, Frank & I talked again, & decided to cancel on his sister to go to my aunt\u2019s & suggest making a dinner plan on a different night with Frank\u2019s family to celebrate Xmas.\n\nHere is why we chose to ditch:\n\nFrank\u2019s father \u201cTony\u201d is abusive. Literally every time we see him, some abuse comes out of his mouth towards Frank\u2019s mom, and recently me. During my pregnancy, last Xmas dinner,  Tony said to me, \u201cI love fat people. Let me take a picture of you.\u201d Months later in my 3rd trimester, we visited for the 1st time since the Xmas insult. When he opened the door, he said to me, \u201cWow you\u2019re so fat. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Not in a joking way. The fact that I have even entertained ever seeing him again after these insults still shocks me today.\n\nKate and Paul are also having Paul\u2019s parents (Pam and Rich) for the dinner. I feel like Frank and I were invited to someone else\u2019s extended family\u2019s dinner. On top of it, last summer at the end of my pregnancy, we were  leaving Kate and Paul\u2019s & Paul told me to be careful on the stairs,. Rich then said, \u201cYou know why he told you to be careful on the stairs? So you don\u2019t break them.\u201d So, no, I don\u2019t want to put myself out in order to spend time with these assholes.\n\nEvery time we leave his family, Frank and I end up drained & upset. For my baby, I want to build happy memories around people who are kind, safe & not abusive. However we love Kate & her kids who will be sad that we can\u2019t go.\nIt\u2019s been 6 years since I have joined my family\u2019s big Xmas Eve bash because of Covid & always accommodating Franks family. My aunts, uncles, and cousins are all super fun, caring people who love to laugh. It\u2019s always so joyous and warm - like from a movie but it\u2019s real life and it\u2019s my family! My cousin will be in from out of town. And my parents are moving to a different province soon so this Christmas might be the last Xmas where we\u2019re close.\n\nI do feel guilty but I also feel like Frank and I have been accommodating everyone else for so many years and for the wrong reasons. We never ask ourselves: What do WE actually want? Now that we have a baby I feel it\u2019s time for us to put our wants and needs first for once. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? Should I feel guilty or should I drop the guilt and feel good about our decision?", "created_utc": 1701564654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189hn2m/aita_for_ditching_my_sisinlaws_xmas_party_to_go/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Isn\u2019t it wonderful what things having kids cause you to learn.  Stuff you never really thought about now make a difference because of your kids.
