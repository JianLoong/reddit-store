Cindy absolutely is by treating you like garbage and not getting treatment for her trauma.\n\nYour job isn't to make her comfortable. It's her job to manage her feelings. You are just living your life. You have a right to live your life comfortably and use common areas of that apartment. \n\nTell your roommates that it is not your job to manage Cindy's anxiety and that you are not going to schedule your common room time.", "NTA \n\nYou are a roommate and have the right to use the common area also.\n\nTell them you will be there anytime except when you are in class.", "NTA - It's your area, start using it.  If she freaks out tell her she needs therapy ASAP.  Scheduling time, nope.  The housing office is just trying to avoid dealing with this.", "I'm not sure I understand exactly what exactly is going on here but NTA, if you are all paying the same amount of rent y'all get access to all the same stuff. Cindy's problems are her own to fix.", "NTA. This is a real bad spot to be in! You should get to live in your living room. That's what it's for. Cindy's clearly got a lot of stuff to deal with, and it's not fair to make you deal with it instead of her.\n\nThat said, you've escaped one bad roommate situation to get stuck in another, and the more you bug the housing office, the more you risk being labeled a complainer to them. It sucks. I feel for you. It might be time to sit down and evaluate the rest of your semester: do you want to have a bad tense time until summer? Then keep on as you are, keep showing up, and assume that Cindy and Alex will not change. Everyone will be unhappy.\n\nScheduling use of the common room puts an undue burden on you, but you might try it for a week just to get them to shut up about it. Make it clear that this is a trial basis, and then at the end of the week you can say, \"well I tried it and this really isn't working for me! I need to be able to exist in the place I live in without restrictions.\" And this will help you to look like the reasonable one.\n\nYou might also pick up a whiteboard calendar and put *everyone's* class/work schedule on it, with the mutual understanding that you might be home at any time, but during your classes is a good chance for Cindy to sit on the couch and meditate on her anxieties or whatever. Again, not because you have to, but because doing so will make you look like the Nice One here.\n\nIt's wild that the explanation is \"you look like someone else\", btw.
