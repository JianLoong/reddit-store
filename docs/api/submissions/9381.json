In this case, the roommate graduated, but a lot of times there is a reason why space opens up in the middle of the year, and it isn't exactly unheard-of to move in and realize you've ended up with the half of a roommate pair that was causing all the problems. The housing people won't give you any backstory, so unless you know someone who lives nearby or have a trusted friend who knows both of the roommates, you are going in completely blind. \n\nYou could also end up in a situation where the person is aiming for a no-roommate situation on purpose, so they are not necessarily the worst person/roommate all the time, but they sure will be to you until you move out and give them the whole room to themselves. That could be the case with this couple, where they think they can make things irritating enough for OP to give them a two-bedroom place to themselves. They may not have to pay extra either, if the housing office assigns people and the guy moves out mid-semester. Sometimes a person will move out well after all the room assignments are done, and the room just stays empty unless there is a rare housing emergency that requires a last-minute move. \n\nI lived in a dorm once that had a room down the hall meant for 3 people, and two roommates moved out mid-year because the third guy was intolerable. The other two guys were seriously chill, and had to be to last 4 months in there, but they both left as soon as they could reasonably get other rooms on campus. Sure enough, a new guy rolled up in January all excited to be the second person in a room meant for 3. His fall roommate had been terrible, so how bad could this be with so much extra space? Two weeks later, he was begging for anywhere else to move and terrified that the housing people would stick him in the worst rooms possible forever because he bothered them about two problem roommates in a row. I pointed him to a friend of a friend whose roommate moved off-campus mid-semester, the voluntary room change was approved, and they lived happily ever after. The intolerable guy kept living alone in his giant 3-person room for the rest of the school year, so I guess that worked out for everyone.", "Cinnamon for me. The taste not the smell.

I had a kind of similar situation with my former roommate.  We were good friends for 9 months and had no issues being in the living room/kitchen at the same time.  Suddenly she started behaving really weirdly and being very anxious.  I think she stopped taking her OCD meds or stress was making her symptoms worse.  Either way, she started asking me to do similar things.  They started off kind of reasonable, like asking me not to play music while I showered because she could hear it.  I didn't know why it was fine for 9 months then suddenly bothered her so I was confused, but it was a small change so it was fine.  Then, things got worse.  She asked me to not use the kitchen at the same time as her.  Asked me to not be in any of the common areas after 10pm.  Told me I couldn't be in the common areas when she was home because she could hear me /breathe/ from in her room and it was triggering her.  Luckily she moved out a few days later when the semester ended, but it was fucking weird and uncomfortable, and it made me question if I was in the wrong for not doing what she asked.\n\nAnyway, all of this to say, don't give in to any of their unreasonable requests.  They will only get worse.  It's your roommate's responsibility to get treatment for her issues and not ask you to change your reasonable behavior to accommodate her.  You aren't doing anything wrong by living in your house.  The housing office only wants you to go along with it so they don't have to deal with complaints or having to arrange another move.\n\nIf I were in your position (or if I could redo my own response to my roommate) I would tell them that you understand that she has issues, but it's unreasonable to ask you to change your normal behavior to accommodate her unreasonable request, and that it's her job to get treatment for her anxiety.
