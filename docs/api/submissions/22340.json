Like is holding your hand too far?", "Soft YTA. You say initially you are holding two weddings for the two cultures. It sounds like you would like two weddings from your culture.\n\nI would change my verdict if he expected to behave as he normally would at the wedding specifically designated to cater to your family and their culture. But I interpret your post as saying the disagreement is around the \"christian\" wedding", "YTA. So you\u2019re asking your fianc\u00e9 to basically not touch you besides a peck on the cheek at BOTH weddings? I\u2019m with his opinion. You care more about not offending a few relatives than offending your husband. It\u2019s his wedding too. I can\u2019t imagine not really touching my husband on our wedding day. Because it sounds like he is only expecting typical socially acceptable physical touch with his wife at the wedding. He\u2019s not arguing to make out with you on the dance floor.", "YTA. You can have less kissing and PDA at the wedding for your family, if you insist on letting them dictate. But not at the other one. Your husband to be should have some say in one of his weddings, at least.", "YTA. You're catering to your conservative families hangs up at not one, but both weddings and denying your future husband's wants and traditions. Doesn't sound like you feel your husband matters at all other than being a prop. Not settling a good precedence.", "NAH. I read through the other comments first because I understand both points of view and I wanted to see if someone smarter and more thoughtful than me had shown up with a great answer. \n\nIt's understandable that the husband thinks it's \\*important\\* to show his affection in his way at the wedding that's tailored to his culture. \n\nThe thing that I'm getting hung up on is this: the husband's feelings will not make the wife more comfortable. A guy who insists on kissing his wife when she's warned him in advance that she's \\*not going to enjoy it\\* is not going to get the result he wants. He's not going to be sharing his joy, he's not going to be having it reflected back at him. He's going to be making his wife unhappy, and bringing down the mood. \n\nI think that anyone who's looking at this question & thinking of the answer needs to grapple with that reality. It's not just \"should the husband be able to kiss his wife\" but \"should the husband be able to insist on kisses that make his wife deeply uncomfortable.\"", "NAH - you mentioned that it makes *you* feel uncomfortable and you\u2019re allowed to feel how you feel. So is he though, and in his shoes I\u2019d both be utterly indifferent to irrelevant cultural mores impinging on my life and pissed at you for allowing anyone else\u2019s views influence how much affection you display.", "yta, you have 2 ceremonies,  one for your family, and one for his. How come in both he doesnt get to enjoy the wedding? you should move in with your family since theur opinion is more important than your fiance having a one in a life time event go his way", "YTA. Marry you family if you care more about them than your husband.", "Depending on how he expressed his frustrations, I\u2019m going with NAH, but possibly N T A \n\nBecause on the one hand, he is right that you shouldn\u2019t care so much about what other people think, and that both of you should be able to express your love at your own wedding however YOU like, and f*ck their judgements. I can imagine he wants to kiss his new wife on the alter, and dance closely, or otherwise celebrate his love openly during y\u2019all\u2019s wedding. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want to have to curb his enthusiasm during such a happy occasion and be more worried about offending other people than celebrating his marriage. Many American weddings even have traditions like guests ringing bells or clinking glasses so the couple has to find and kiss each other randomly throughout the reception. The couple being affectionate is seen as part of the celebration, and sometimes even done in over-the-top ways purposefully for fun. \n\nBut on the other hand, you are allowed to have boundaries, and if YOU are truly the one uncomfortable (and you aren\u2019t just letting your family dictate your feelings), then you have every right to set boundaries. Are you usually uncomfortable with PDA?\n\nIt sounds like you may get to make your first marriage compromise. What if you carried a fan or parasol and \u2018hide\u2019 behind it during your kiss? Would that work for you? You should 100% be comfortable with whatever affection you receive, but he does have a point about caring too much about what other people think.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I were your fiance I'd be pretty mad too!!", "NAH I\u2019m from a similar background and yeah, I\u2019ve never been to an Indian wedding where there was a kiss at all, not even a peck.  My cousin had a first dance at his wedding and oh man were the elders scandalized lol Still, they have two kids in their teens now and the people who turned their chairs so they wouldn\u2019t have to see and the one uncle who had to be convinced not to walk out, well, they got over it. Or just died so they can\u2019t complain anymore but Point is, your relatives will get over it.

I think having some agreement about what  level of affection is shown at a wedding is good, no matter what the culture.  From the way you describe it, it seems he is being dismissive of your feelings as well as your culture and identity.  \n\nIt reminds me of the talk the lady who made our cake gave my husband and I.  When we picked out the cake, she told us we had to agree ahead of time on the whole cutting the cake thing and if we were going to feed each other a bite  or smash cake in faces or not do it all. For her, it was the true test of respecting each other\u2019s boundaries.  A surprise frosting on the nose or cake on the eye was a sign the couple was clearly heading for divorce.

Maul you on the dance floor? I don't think that's normal even in an all white affair.\n\nYOU don't feel comfortable with pda in front of your family. That is 100 percent ok regardless of the color of the wedding.\n\nThese are the types of cultural differences to be addressed way before the ceremony and I am sure he is more than familiar with the conservative values of Desi families...if not comfortable or at least accepting of them by now.\n\n\nHe s being an AH.\nI also think this fight isnt about the pda but a last ditch effort to let you know he doesn't agree with our culture in more general terms...(or someone else in his family voiced this in relation to the pda issue).\n\nStand your ground.\nAnd be careful.", "NTA but I\u2019m not interested in how others may feel.

It makes YOU uncomfortable. I bet he will be way more understanding. \n\nPart of being married is communication.

However, I can understand your partner being disappointed that he won\u2019t be able to express affection in the way he is used to, on the day that is supposed to be celebrating your love.

Him not wanting to put your needs first does not bode well for your marriage, I'm afraid, and him not caring whether he makes a whole lot of people unhappy, including his BRIDE, no less, does not speak well of his character.", "NAH. I understand your fianc\u00e9\u2019s POV that he wants to share a culturally appropriate intimate moment with you at the ceremony representing his culture, and not wanting to have your family\u2019s judgments ruin that, and the general unfairness he may feel that he\u2019s having to cave on something for *both* ceremonies.\n\nEven so, if it\u2019s something you\u2019re uncomfortable with doing in front of your family in of itself then you should be able to feel comfortable.

The elders of your family must think highly of you. Wonderful!", "You do understand that this goes much beyond the marriage ceremony itself? Are you sure he would be respectful of the boundaries - like not kissing or too much PDA in front of family after marriage?\n\nHow about you are visiting family in India and he gets affectionate when everyone is sitting down for dinner, or in front of the myriad kids or the older generation. We were brought up in a certain way to observe certain social norms. \n\nWe Indians do keep these demonstrations of affection away from the public eye. In the \"White\" culture it's the exact opposite. If it's not \"in your face\" it doesn't exist. \n\nI think you need to have a longish talk with your fiance and set certain ground rules about the expected code of conduct around your family. These things have a tendency to blow up and cause unnecessary drama if not handled well.\n.", "American here. Very liberal, very progressive, as far from conservative as you can get.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t really like PDA. I don\u2019t indulge and I have no desire to see anyone else indulge.\n\nOvert all over each other PDA seems performative to me. Not genuine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a heartfelt kiss, holding hands, hugs, etc. But you don\u2019t need to crawl all over each other.\n \nYour fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t have a problem with that.

I'll say this -> You said *YOU* would be uncomfortable doing PDA in front of your relatives. This has less to do with them, and more about your comfort level.\n\nEveryone who is voting Y T A is neglecting to think about you. Your husband can feel sad, but just promise him all the PDA in the world during your honeymoon or whatever.", "NTA\n\nI completely understand wanting to celebrate your love for your wife at your wedding, but like you said, you come from a different cultural background. Your culture is a part of who you are, and he'll have to learn to respect who you are if he wants to marry you.\n\nHis concerns about what people think sound like projection. Other cultures having different standards of modesty doesn't make them judgments or backwards. He wouldn't like if your dad showed up to the wedding without any clothes on regardless of his reasoning, so this shouldn't be an issue.", "NTA. Personally, as a guest, I feel a little weird when couples full on make out at the alter and if I was the bride, I'd feel weird making out in front of my parents!  I'm not especially conservative, but that just sounds awkward! I think his take their opinions back to India was a very rude and insensitive statement. I know he's trying to be supportive of you and your own disagreement of their beliefs, but as someone who also has parents more conservative than me, it still hurts when people don't at least try to see where other's PoV is coming from. If they no kissing at all and don't dance close, I could see these seeming \"unreasonable\" by American standards (but they should still be respected), but based on the comments you've responded to, your expectations seem reasonable. I suppose the biggest thing you two need to do is sit down and discuss your individual visions for affection at the wedding and sort out what would make it the most comfortable and enjoyable time for you both.", "I\u2019m fine with kissing at the ceremony, hugging and slow dancing but I don\u2019t want to kiss during the first dance when everyone is watching", "Exactly this!!!", "if my future wife said no kissing on the wedding, there would be no wedding.

Where's the compromise on her part? She says there's 2 ceremonies for each culture but it seems like she's just doing both ceremonies to her culture only. Her not caring if the GROOM is happy doesn't speak well of HER character.", "You don\u2019t have to justify or explain anything to me, I\u2019m just tossing out ideas, here. \n\nI don\u2019t know how many American weddings you\u2019ve been to, but the couple being affectionate with each other is usually a big part of them, people cheer every time the couple kisses at the reception. At the alter, depending on the sense of humor of the couple, they may do a kiss with a dip, (at my next wedding, I (f) have every intention of being the one doing the dipping). You may not realize it, but this is a large part of the wedding celebration that you are rejecting. \n\nYOU HAVE EVERY SINGLE RIGHT TO THAT BOUNDARY\n\nI just want you to see what you are telling him, in case you think it\u2019s a small thing that shouldn\u2019t matter at all. If my fianc\u00e9 had this boundary, I would obviously respect it, but it would hurt, and it would take away from the celebration, for me. If my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t normally so against PDA, and I thought they were just embarrassed because of their family, I would probably have a lot of resentment for that family, or I would try to convince my fianc\u00e9 that their opinions shouldn\u2019t dictate our celebration. \n\nBut, I am also an affectionate person in general. I wouldn\u2019t likely be in a relationship with someone who wasn\u2019t comfortable with PDA (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, we just wouldn\u2019t be a good fit). \n\nThat\u2019s why I asked if you are usually against PDA, because if you are, then he shouldn\u2019t be surprised. If you aren\u2019t usually against it, it sounds like you are asking him to change how he celebrates to accommodate your family, not you, and that\u2019s frustrating at a celebration that\u2019s supposed to be about YOUR LOVE.", "Why does OP need to \"meet his needs\" with PDA if she's not confortable? OP clearly stated her boundaries.", "You are allowed to set your boundaries. He has the right to set his own. Now the question is, is any of you willing to compromise?

Let me give you a story to illustrate why. I live in the US and in the US, weddings involve kissing on the mouth. It's part of the wedding ceremony. At my cousin's wedding, her new husband refused to kiss her. The entire congregation, both sides of the family, all the guests and even the minister were shocked that he wouldn't. The minister asked him several times to. There was an audible crowd gasp. It was incredibly uncomfortable and she was in tears. What was so sad is that at most weddings in the US the couple can't get enough kissing and this guy couldn't even make the effort to. They didn't last. While this may not be your culture, you need to understand that this his. His relatives may consider you disrespectful for not kissing him as ours did with my cousin's husband.", "YTA - your husband isn't asking for a lap dance in front of your parents, he's asking to be able to truly kiss his wife at the moment when it's traditional to do so in his culture. \n\nI think asking him to tone down his affection for you at your wedding ceremony to appease your family might be a bad sign for your ability to navigate a multicultural family, but idk.", "If my partner wasn't willing to show PDA at the wedding, I don't know if there would be a wedding. You're having two separate ceremonies to deal with the cultural gap, but there might as well not be two ceremonies and just do an Indian ceremony if you want the Christian ceremony to match with your cultural expectations. You're not an asshole for withholding consent from your partner, generally, but I will make this judgement YTA because it seems that right now you're only making decisions based off what you want and what you think your family wants, and I think you also need to approach your wedding willing to listen to what your husband and husband's family wants too.\n\nIf your family is going to be uncomfortable with seeing you guys kiss and that will make you uncomfortable, can you not see why he might also have the same problem in reverse? That if you two show incredibly less PDA than a normal couple on their wedding day, his family will be uncomfortable through some level of concerned that you two aren't happy to be married which will make him uncomfortable. American weddings very much emphasize the love between the couple to the point of more PDA than normal.\n\nIf you want to marry this man, you need to figure out how you can both be happy with the wedding. Not just focus on pleasing your family.\n\nEDIT: this comment has been made on the assumption that by saying \"*I'm uncomfortable with PDA in front of my family*,\" you don't mean \"*I'm always uncomfortable with PDA generally*.\" Which I think is the most logical read of your wording because A) why would you say \"in front of my family\" if this wasn't about them, and B) because this take seemed to surprise your partner, who would've known if you were just not into PDA by now and shouldn't have been surprised if this was a general opinion. I wouldn't make this same judgement if this was a more general issue that he should've already been aware of and not an issue of who the audience is in particular.", "NAH except your family (a little). I find Indians very judgemental of showing any kind of affection to their partner and that\u2019s not good. They\u2019d be fine watching a man beat his wife on the road but kissing her is where they draw the line. I understand why you\u2019re worried, I\u2019m Indian too. But, it\u2019s his wedding too. It\u2019s literally a celebration of your love. You\u2019re an adult, will be married, may have kids at some point (your family knows how they\u2019re made), will be living together, but kissing at your wedding is not okay for them? Yes, a sloppy make out session would be tacky, but if he wants to hold you close, kiss you longer, grab your waist, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.", "Yta", "YTA.

I also understand your husband\u2019s perspective since weddings are one of the places where PDA is not just accepted but encouraged in his culture.", "YTA.

Christian wedding with only western friends and his family, Indian ceremony with her family and any Indian friends she has traveling for it? Maybe only with the very closest of family members at both?\n\nI'm saying all this on the assumption that OP's repeated wording that she's \"uncomfortable with PDA in front of \\[her\\] family\" means what it implies, which is NOT that she's not as uncomfortable with PDA *regardless of who that public is.* That she is okay with PDA when the public isn't her Indian family.

You\u2019ll be holding hands and weddings are weddings - you will be emotional and show affection to your husband in the way you know how. There is a middle ground here - it doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. Talk to your friends, talk to other Desi/American multiracial couples and find out what they did. (Tons of amazing biracial influencers also have demonstrated ways of balancing these two cultures).

Enforcing rules from one culture onto another is wrong no matter how you spin it.  \n\nEdit: So idk if she updated the post, but there seems to be more context than when I read the post originally.

I think if this is the case, it's really such an unfair thing that the only day that he doesn't get to have what he probably considers their normal level of casual physical affection is the one day where it's culturally most important. \n\nAnd there are absolutely discussions that can be had over individual traditions-- if she's not comfortable with the garter thing, or the glass clinking thing, or whatever.

There's a whole sliding scale between ONE peck at the alter and molesting each other on the dance floor. Honestly, I wouldn't marry someone who wasn't willing to kiss me more than once on the wedding day (in front of people)-- it would make me really sad to not be able to have a spontaneous romantic (G-rated) moment at any point on what's supposed to be the day celebrating our relationship. It would make me feel ridiculous to go off to steal away kisses like highschoolers on the one day you'd never expect to do that. She's fine with \"hugs, slow dancing, and one kiss\". I mean, that first thing often gets shared with every guest at the wedding, the second one does happen between family members at the wedding too, so they're not even super romantic physical affection inherently, OP could just as easily mean hug her partner in a platonic way and only dance with room for Jesus between them as she might mean she's okay with what romantic hugging and romantic slow dancing look like at a wedding normally. \n\nIf this was a general issue she had, then it would make sense to say that if he's gotten this far in the relationship, he should have always understood his wedding would be like that, but it really doesn't sound like, from OP, that she's like this more generally.  Imagine having a girlfriend or boyfriend who's usually okay with a totally normal and acceptable amount of PDA suddenly going \"we can't even kiss in front of my family more than once\" regarding the one day in your life where you would expect to have the most amount of casual physical affection between you two?
