Like is holding your hand too far?", "Soft YTA. You say initially you are holding two weddings for the two cultures. It sounds like you would like two weddings from your culture.\n\nI would change my verdict if he expected to behave as he normally would at the wedding specifically designated to cater to your family and their culture. But I interpret your post as saying the disagreement is around the \"christian\" wedding", "YTA. So you\u2019re asking your fianc\u00e9 to basically not touch you besides a peck on the cheek at BOTH weddings? I\u2019m with his opinion. You care more about not offending a few relatives than offending your husband. It\u2019s his wedding too. I can\u2019t imagine not really touching my husband on our wedding day. Because it sounds like he is only expecting typical socially acceptable physical touch with his wife at the wedding. He\u2019s not arguing to make out with you on the dance floor.", "YTA. You can have less kissing and PDA at the wedding for your family, if you insist on letting them dictate. But not at the other one. Your husband to be should have some say in one of his weddings, at least.", "YTA. You're catering to your conservative families hangs up at not one, but both weddings and denying your future husband's wants and traditions. Doesn't sound like you feel your husband matters at all other than being a prop. Not settling a good precedence.", "NAH. I read through the other comments first because I understand both points of view and I wanted to see if someone smarter and more thoughtful than me had shown up with a great answer. \n\nIt's understandable that the husband thinks it's \\*important\\* to show his affection in his way at the wedding that's tailored to his culture. \n\nThe thing that I'm getting hung up on is this: the husband's feelings will not make the wife more comfortable. A guy who insists on kissing his wife when she's warned him in advance that she's \\*not going to enjoy it\\* is not going to get the result he wants. He's not going to be sharing his joy, he's not going to be having it reflected back at him. He's going to be making his wife unhappy, and bringing down the mood. \n\nI think that anyone who's looking at this question & thinking of the answer needs to grapple with that reality. It's not just \"should the husband be able to kiss his wife\" but \"should the husband be able to insist on kisses that make his wife deeply uncomfortable.\"", "NAH - you mentioned that it makes *you* feel uncomfortable and you\u2019re allowed to feel how you feel. So is he though, and in his shoes I\u2019d both be utterly indifferent to irrelevant cultural mores impinging on my life and pissed at you for allowing anyone else\u2019s views influence how much affection you display.", "yta, you have 2 ceremonies,  one for your family, and one for his. How come in both he doesnt get to enjoy the wedding? you should move in with your family since theur opinion is more important than your fiance having a one in a life time event go his way", "YTA. Marry you family if you care more about them than your husband.", "Depending on how he expressed his frustrations, I\u2019m going with NAH, but possibly N T A \n\nBecause on the one hand, he is right that you shouldn\u2019t care so much about what other people think, and that both of you should be able to express your love at your own wedding however YOU like, and f*ck their judgements. I can imagine he wants to kiss his new wife on the alter, and dance closely, or otherwise celebrate his love openly during y\u2019all\u2019s wedding. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want to have to curb his enthusiasm during such a happy occasion and be more worried about offending other people than celebrating his marriage. Many American weddings even have traditions like guests ringing bells or clinking glasses so the couple has to find and kiss each other randomly throughout the reception. The couple being affectionate is seen as part of the celebration, and sometimes even done in over-the-top ways purposefully for fun. \n\nBut on the other hand, you are allowed to have boundaries, and if YOU are truly the one uncomfortable (and you aren\u2019t just letting your family dictate your feelings), then you have every right to set boundaries. Are you usually uncomfortable with PDA?\n\nIt sounds like you may get to make your first marriage compromise. What if you carried a fan or parasol and \u2018hide\u2019 behind it during your kiss? Would that work for you? You should 100% be comfortable with whatever affection you receive, but he does have a point about caring too much about what other people think.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes there are cultural and religious differences, but I assume the grown people coming in from India are aware of their existence too. They are choosing to come to this Christian, American wedding. It's not a surprise porn movie.\n\nI think you overthought, said it, and now don't know what to do. You aren't uncomfortable with PDA. You are uncomfortable wanting your family to approve of him. But let me assure you, no matter what happens that day, the man at the end of the aisle is right. They will take their judgement back to India and go on about their lives. It's OK. \n\nSoft YTA, because I think you have wedding nerves.", "Don't bother with the second ceremony...", "YTA", "NTA and the bring the judgements back to India statement raised a big red flag IMO", "YTA. It's high time you cut the apron strings. You're getting married and you are scared to kiss in front of your relatives? What do you think is going to happen? They all suddenly get up and leave?  Seriously, your wedding day is a day where kissing each other is very much accepted. If I were your fiance I'd be pretty mad too!!", "NAH I\u2019m from a similar background and yeah, I\u2019ve never been to an Indian wedding where there was a kiss at all, not even a peck.  My cousin had a first dance at his wedding and oh man were the elders scandalized lol Still, they have two kids in their teens now and the people who turned their chairs so they wouldn\u2019t have to see and the one uncle who had to be convinced not to walk out, well, they got over it. Or just died so they can\u2019t complain anymore but Point is, your relatives will get over it. If the PDA thing is only for their sake (as opposed to your own personal preference) then I\u2019d consider prioritizing yourself and your husband rather than them. Times are changing.", "NTA.  I think having some agreement about what  level of affection is shown at a wedding is good, no matter what the culture.  From the way you describe it, it seems he is being dismissive of your feelings as well as your culture and identity.  \n\nIt reminds me of the talk the lady who made our cake gave my husband and I.  When we picked out the cake, she told us we had to agree ahead of time on the whole cutting the cake thing and if we were going to feed each other a bite  or smash cake in faces or not do it all. For her, it was the true test of respecting each other\u2019s boundaries.  A surprise frosting on the nose or cake on the eye was a sign the couple was clearly heading for divorce. We joke a little about getting \u201cthe Talk\u201d from the cake lady but she\u2019s not wrong.", "NTA.\n\nI'm Desi (born in the states) and have been to countless mixed marriages, including my own brother's, that involved 2 ceremonies.\n\nNever once have I encountered a partner who resisted the cultural norm of little/no pda. The \"white\" party (especially if a guy) had to go through SO many barriers to even make it to the altar that they wouldnt even consider making it an issue.\n\nAfter aaallllll the work they had to do to be accepted by a desi family...pda at the wedding is the hill they want to die on?\n\nStupid af.\n\nWhat does he want to do, have a full blown second base session at the white wedding? Maul you on the dance floor? I don't think that's normal even in an all white affair.\n\nYOU don't feel comfortable with pda in front of your family. That is 100 percent ok regardless of the color of the wedding.\n\nThese are the types of cultural differences to be addressed way before the ceremony and I am sure he is more than familiar with the conservative values of Desi families...if not comfortable or at least accepting of them by now.\n\n\nHe s being an AH.\nI also think this fight isnt about the pda but a last ditch effort to let you know he doesn't agree with our culture in more general terms...(or someone else in his family voiced this in relation to the pda issue).\n\nStand your ground.\nAnd be careful.", "NTA but I\u2019m not interested in how others may feel. You said it makes you feel awkward. Don\u2019t blame it on your family and random relatives that your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t care the opinion of. Be clear about why you have asked this. It makes YOU uncomfortable. I bet he will be way more understanding. \n\nPart of being married is communication. Blaming what you want/don\u2019t want on others because you don\u2019t want to be the bad guy won\u2019t get you far.", "NAH - it\u2019s very kind that you are trying to respect your family and not do anything to make them uncomfortable. However, I can understand your partner being disappointed that he won\u2019t be able to express affection in the way he is used to, on the day that is supposed to be celebrating your love. I\u2019d be genuinely sad if I had limits on how much or often I could kiss or physically interact with my partner on my wedding day.", "NTA. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with it then that\u2019s really all that matters.", "NTA- the important part is that YOU don't want too much PDA, and making your conservative relatives uncomfortable would make YOU uncomfortable. Him not wanting to put your needs first does not bode well for your marriage, I'm afraid, and him not caring whether he makes a whole lot of people unhappy, including his BRIDE, no less, does not speak well of his character.", "NAH. I understand your fianc\u00e9\u2019s POV that he wants to share a culturally appropriate intimate moment with you at the ceremony representing his culture, and not wanting to have your family\u2019s judgments ruin that, and the general unfairness he may feel that he\u2019s having to cave on something for *both* ceremonies.\n\nEven so, if it\u2019s something you\u2019re uncomfortable with doing in front of your family in of itself then you should be able to feel comfortable. I get it. For non-religious/cultural reasons I\u2019m uncomfortable showing PDA in front of my family. Some people are just like that.\n\nalso, consider telling your fiance something like \u201clet\u2019s save it for that night when we don\u2019t have to stop at just a kiss\u201d it might appease him.", "I'm going to take a different stance here and say NTA. You have your cultural norms. He has his. There needs to be respect on both sides. \n\nWhat worries me about the future of your marriage is this:\n\n>When I told my fianc\u00e9 he told me that I care waaay too much about what other people think and my family can \u201ctake their judgements back to India\u201d and was overall angry because I\u2019ve doesn\u2019t like that my family is so conservative.\n\nThe fact is he's not respecting your culture, your family and you. It appears he's wants to to overlook your cultural norms to accommodate his preferences. Where you've made the compromise on your Christian ceremony to kiss, the fact is many other cultures don't incorporate the \"kiss\" into the wedding rituals. \n\nI hope you're both able to come to some healthy respect about the cultural differences. If not, you may have a rough go of it", "NTA, your fianc\u00e9 needs to show more respect for your culture and ideals honestly", "NTA\n\nTell your husband, \"This is about ME and MY comfort levels at OUR wedding.  I want our marriage to start from a place of mutual respect, and it does not feel respectful to me that you want to push against my PDA comfort zone because of how you perceive my family.  Please respect MY wishes without trying to place blame on my family for MY choices.\"", "technically NAH bc you\u2019re allowed to have your own boundaries and he should respect that. \n\nBUT im on your fianc\u00e9\u2019s side. your fianc\u00e9 is asking for actions that are totally normal within the context of a western wedding. now if we were talking about your indian ceremony , i would say he should conform to your cultural standards.. but it sounds like he is ok with that part. \n\ni\u2019m all for cultural sensitivity but tbh your relatives are coming to the west for this wedding and they should be just as culturally sensitive towards western weddings as much as your fianc\u00e9 should be culturally sensitive towards your family\u2019s cultural habits. not cool of them to come blazing in with their prejudices and judgments about other people\u2019s cultural practices and not cool of you to enable it either.", "NTA I like that you respect your culture and traditions. The elders of your family must think highly of you. Wonderful!", "You do understand that this goes much beyond the marriage ceremony itself? Are you sure he would be respectful of the boundaries - like not kissing or too much PDA in front of family after marriage?\n\nHow about you are visiting family in India and he gets affectionate when everyone is sitting down for dinner, or in front of the myriad kids or the older generation. We were brought up in a certain way to observe certain social norms. \n\nWe Indians do keep these demonstrations of affection away from the public eye. In the \"White\" culture it's the exact opposite. If it's not \"in your face\" it doesn't exist. \n\nI think you need to have a longish talk with your fiance and set certain ground rules about the expected code of conduct around your family. These things have a tendency to blow up and cause unnecessary drama if not handled well.\n.", "American here. Very liberal, very progressive, as far from conservative as you can get.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t really like PDA. I don\u2019t indulge and I have no desire to see anyone else indulge.\n\nOvert all over each other PDA seems performative to me. Not genuine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a heartfelt kiss, holding hands, hugs, etc. But you don\u2019t need to crawl all over each other.\n \nYour fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t have a problem with that. And you shouldn\u2019t have a problem with a sincere, brief display of affection.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm gonna say I understand you culturally. I'll say this -> You said *YOU* would be uncomfortable doing PDA in front of your relatives. This has less to do with them, and more about your comfort level.\n\nEveryone who is voting Y T A is neglecting to think about you. Your husband can feel sad, but just promise him all the PDA in the world during your honeymoon or whatever.", "NTA\n\nI completely understand wanting to celebrate your love for your wife at your wedding, but like you said, you come from a different cultural background. Your culture is a part of who you are, and he'll have to learn to respect who you are if he wants to marry you.\n\nHis concerns about what people think sound like projection. Other cultures having different standards of modesty doesn't make them judgments or backwards. He wouldn't like if your dad showed up to the wedding without any clothes on regardless of his reasoning, so this shouldn't be an issue.", "NTA. Personally, as a guest, I feel a little weird when couples full on make out at the alter and if I was the bride, I'd feel weird making out in front of my parents!  I'm not especially conservative, but that just sounds awkward! I think his take their opinions back to India was a very rude and insensitive statement. I know he's trying to be supportive of you and your own disagreement of their beliefs, but as someone who also has parents more conservative than me, it still hurts when people don't at least try to see where other's PoV is coming from. If they no kissing at all and don't dance close, I could see these seeming \"unreasonable\" by American standards (but they should still be respected), but based on the comments you've responded to, your expectations seem reasonable. I suppose the biggest thing you two need to do is sit down and discuss your individual visions for affection at the wedding and sort out what would make it the most comfortable and enjoyable time for you both.", "I\u2019m fine with kissing at the ceremony, hugging and slow dancing but I don\u2019t want to kiss during the first dance when everyone is watching", "Exactly this!!!", "if my future wife said no kissing on the wedding, there would be no wedding. Ill respect their boundaries by letting them find a more suitable partner", "Great point!", "I\u2019m fine with a kiss at the ceremony ( as long it\u2019s not a full blown make out session or a very long kiss)", "I was gonna say, if you come from a conservative Indian family, I wonder why *this* is the major issue when I'm sure there were more hurdles along the way.", "What about his needs? Where's the compromise on her part? She says there's 2 ceremonies for each culture but it seems like she's just doing both ceremonies to her culture only. Her not caring if the GROOM is happy doesn't speak well of HER character.", "You don\u2019t have to justify or explain anything to me, I\u2019m just tossing out ideas, here. \n\nI don\u2019t know how many American weddings you\u2019ve been to, but the couple being affectionate with each other is usually a big part of them, people cheer every time the couple kisses at the reception. At the alter, depending on the sense of humor of the couple, they may do a kiss with a dip, (at my next wedding, I (f) have every intention of being the one doing the dipping). You may not realize it, but this is a large part of the wedding celebration that you are rejecting. \n\nYOU HAVE EVERY SINGLE RIGHT TO THAT BOUNDARY\n\nI just want you to see what you are telling him, in case you think it\u2019s a small thing that shouldn\u2019t matter at all. If my fianc\u00e9 had this boundary, I would obviously respect it, but it would hurt, and it would take away from the celebration, for me. If my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t normally so against PDA, and I thought they were just embarrassed because of their family, I would probably have a lot of resentment for that family, or I would try to convince my fianc\u00e9 that their opinions shouldn\u2019t dictate our celebration. \n\nBut, I am also an affectionate person in general. I wouldn\u2019t likely be in a relationship with someone who wasn\u2019t comfortable with PDA (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, we just wouldn\u2019t be a good fit). \n\nThat\u2019s why I asked if you are usually against PDA, because if you are, then he shouldn\u2019t be surprised. If you aren\u2019t usually against it, it sounds like you are asking him to change how he celebrates to accommodate your family, not you, and that\u2019s frustrating at a celebration that\u2019s supposed to be about YOUR LOVE.", "Why does OP need to \"meet his needs\" with PDA if she's not confortable? OP clearly stated her boundaries."]}
