Like is holding your hand too far?", "Soft YTA. You say initially you are holding two weddings for the two cultures. It sounds like you would like two weddings from your culture.\n\nI would change my verdict if he expected to behave as he normally would at the wedding specifically designated to cater to your family and their culture. But I interpret your post as saying the disagreement is around the \"christian\" wedding", "YTA. So you\u2019re asking your fianc\u00e9 to basically not touch you besides a peck on the cheek at BOTH weddings? I\u2019m with his opinion. You care more about not offending a few relatives than offending your husband. It\u2019s his wedding too. I can\u2019t imagine not really touching my husband on our wedding day. Because it sounds like he is only expecting typical socially acceptable physical touch with his wife at the wedding. He\u2019s not arguing to make out with you on the dance floor.", "YTA. You can have less kissing and PDA at the wedding for your family, if you insist on letting them dictate. But not at the other one. Your husband to be should have some say in one of his weddings, at least.", "YTA. You're catering to your conservative families hangs up at not one, but both weddings and denying your future husband's wants and traditions. Doesn't sound like you feel your husband matters at all other than being a prop. Not settling a good precedence.", "NAH. I read through the other comments first because I understand both points of view and I wanted to see if someone smarter and more thoughtful than me had shown up with a great answer. \n\nIt's understandable that the husband thinks it's \\*important\\* to show his affection in his way at the wedding that's tailored to his culture. \n\nThe thing that I'm getting hung up on is this: the husband's feelings will not make the wife more comfortable. A guy who insists on kissing his wife when she's warned him in advance that she's \\*not going to enjoy it\\* is not going to get the result he wants. He's not going to be sharing his joy, he's not going to be having it reflected back at him. He's going to be making his wife unhappy, and bringing down the mood. \n\nI think that anyone who's looking at this question & thinking of the answer needs to grapple with that reality. It's not just \"should the husband be able to kiss his wife\" but \"should the husband be able to insist on kisses that make his wife deeply uncomfortable.\"", "NAH - you mentioned that it makes *you* feel uncomfortable and you\u2019re allowed to feel how you feel. So is he though, and in his shoes I\u2019d both be utterly indifferent to irrelevant cultural mores impinging on my life and pissed at you for allowing anyone else\u2019s views influence how much affection you display.", "yta, you have 2 ceremonies,  one for your family, and one for his. How come in both he doesnt get to enjoy the wedding? you should move in with your family since theur opinion is more important than your fiance having a one in a life time event go his way", "YTA. Marry you family if you care more about them than your husband.", "Depending on how he expressed his frustrations, I\u2019m going with NAH, but possibly N T A \n\nBecause on the one hand, he is right that you shouldn\u2019t care so much about what other people think, and that both of you should be able to express your love at your own wedding however YOU like, and f*ck their judgements. I can imagine he wants to kiss his new wife on the alter, and dance closely, or otherwise celebrate his love openly during y\u2019all\u2019s wedding. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want to have to curb his enthusiasm during such a happy occasion and be more worried about offending other people than celebrating his marriage. Many American weddings even have traditions like guests ringing bells or clinking glasses so the couple has to find and kiss each other randomly throughout the reception. The couple being affectionate is seen as part of the celebration, and sometimes even done in over-the-top ways purposefully for fun. \n\nBut on the other hand, you are allowed to have boundaries, and if YOU are truly the one uncomfortable (and you aren\u2019t just letting your family dictate your feelings), then you have every right to set boundaries. Are you usually uncomfortable with PDA?\n\nIt sounds like you may get to make your first marriage compromise. What if you carried a fan or parasol and \u2018hide\u2019 behind it during your kiss? Would that work for you? You should 100% be comfortable with whatever affection you receive, but he does have a point about caring too much about what other people think.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I were your fiance I'd be pretty mad too!!", "NAH I\u2019m from a similar background and yeah, I\u2019ve never been to an Indian wedding where there was a kiss at all, not even a peck.  My cousin had a first dance at his wedding and oh man were the elders scandalized lol Still, they have two kids in their teens now and the people who turned their chairs so they wouldn\u2019t have to see and the one uncle who had to be convinced not to walk out, well, they got over it. Or just died so they can\u2019t complain anymore but Point is, your relatives will get over it.

I think having some agreement about what  level of affection is shown at a wedding is good, no matter what the culture.  From the way you describe it, it seems he is being dismissive of your feelings as well as your culture and identity.  \n\nIt reminds me of the talk the lady who made our cake gave my husband and I.  When we picked out the cake, she told us we had to agree ahead of time on the whole cutting the cake thing and if we were going to feed each other a bite  or smash cake in faces or not do it all. For her, it was the true test of respecting each other\u2019s boundaries.  A surprise frosting on the nose or cake on the eye was a sign the couple was clearly heading for divorce.

Maul you on the dance floor? I don't think that's normal even in an all white affair.\n\nYOU don't feel comfortable with pda in front of your family. That is 100 percent ok regardless of the color of the wedding.\n\nThese are the types of cultural differences to be addressed way before the ceremony and I am sure he is more than familiar with the conservative values of Desi families...if not comfortable or at least accepting of them by now.\n\n\nHe s being an AH.\nI also think this fight isnt about the pda but a last ditch effort to let you know he doesn't agree with our culture in more general terms...(or someone else in his family voiced this in relation to the pda issue).\n\nStand your ground.\nAnd be careful.", "NTA but I\u2019m not interested in how others may feel.

It makes YOU uncomfortable. I bet he will be way more understanding. \n\nPart of being married is communication.

However, I can understand your partner being disappointed that he won\u2019t be able to express affection in the way he is used to, on the day that is supposed to be celebrating your love.

Him not wanting to put your needs first does not bode well for your marriage, I'm afraid, and him not caring whether he makes a whole lot of people unhappy, including his BRIDE, no less, does not speak well of his character.", "NAH. I understand your fianc\u00e9\u2019s POV that he wants to share a culturally appropriate intimate moment with you at the ceremony representing his culture, and not wanting to have your family\u2019s judgments ruin that, and the general unfairness he may feel that he\u2019s having to cave on something for *both* ceremonies.\n\nEven so, if it\u2019s something you\u2019re uncomfortable with doing in front of your family in of itself then you should be able to feel comfortable.

The elders of your family must think highly of you. Wonderful!", "You do understand that this goes much beyond the marriage ceremony itself? Are you sure he would be respectful of the boundaries - like not kissing or too much PDA in front of family after marriage?\n\nHow about you are visiting family in India and he gets affectionate when everyone is sitting down for dinner, or in front of the myriad kids or the older generation. We were brought up in a certain way to observe certain social norms. \n\nWe Indians do keep these demonstrations of affection away from the public eye. In the \"White\" culture it's the exact opposite. If it's not \"in your face\" it doesn't exist. \n\nI think you need to have a longish talk with your fiance and set certain ground rules about the expected code of conduct around your family. These things have a tendency to blow up and cause unnecessary drama if not handled well.\n.", "American here. Very liberal, very progressive, as far from conservative as you can get.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t really like PDA. I don\u2019t indulge and I have no desire to see anyone else indulge.\n\nOvert all over each other PDA seems performative to me. Not genuine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a heartfelt kiss, holding hands, hugs, etc. But you don\u2019t need to crawl all over each other.\n \nYour fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t have a problem with that.

I'll say this -> You said *YOU* would be uncomfortable doing PDA in front of your relatives. This has less to do with them, and more about your comfort level.\n\nEveryone who is voting Y T A is neglecting to think about you. Your husband can feel sad, but just promise him all the PDA in the world during your honeymoon or whatever.", "NTA\n\nI completely understand wanting to celebrate your love for your wife at your wedding, but like you said, you come from a different cultural background. Your culture is a part of who you are, and he'll have to learn to respect who you are if he wants to marry you.\n\nHis concerns about what people think sound like projection. Other cultures having different standards of modesty doesn't make them judgments or backwards. He wouldn't like if your dad showed up to the wedding without any clothes on regardless of his reasoning, so this shouldn't be an issue.", "NTA. Personally, as a guest, I feel a little weird when couples full on make out at the alter and if I was the bride, I'd feel weird making out in front of my parents!  I'm not especially conservative, but that just sounds awkward! I think his take their opinions back to India was a very rude and insensitive statement. I know he's trying to be supportive of you and your own disagreement of their beliefs, but as someone who also has parents more conservative than me, it still hurts when people don't at least try to see where other's PoV is coming from. If they no kissing at all and don't dance close, I could see these seeming \"unreasonable\" by American standards (but they should still be respected), but based on the comments you've responded to, your expectations seem reasonable. I suppose the biggest thing you two need to do is sit down and discuss your individual visions for affection at the wedding and sort out what would make it the most comfortable and enjoyable time for you both.", "I\u2019m fine with kissing at the ceremony, hugging and slow dancing but I don\u2019t want to kiss during the first dance when everyone is watching", "Exactly this!!!", "if my future wife said no kissing on the wedding, there would be no wedding. Ill respect their boundaries by letting them find a more suitable partner", "Great point!", "I\u2019m fine with a kiss at the ceremony ( as long it\u2019s not a full blown make out session or a very long kiss)", "I was gonna say, if you come from a conservative Indian family, I wonder why *this* is the major issue when I'm sure there were more hurdles along the way.", "What about his needs? Where's the compromise on her part? She says there's 2 ceremonies for each culture but it seems like she's just doing both ceremonies to her culture only. Her not caring if the GROOM is happy doesn't speak well of HER character.", "You don\u2019t have to justify or explain anything to me, I\u2019m just tossing out ideas, here. \n\nI don\u2019t know how many American weddings you\u2019ve been to, but the couple being affectionate with each other is usually a big part of them, people cheer every time the couple kisses at the reception. At the alter, depending on the sense of humor of the couple, they may do a kiss with a dip, (at my next wedding, I (f) have every intention of being the one doing the dipping). You may not realize it, but this is a large part of the wedding celebration that you are rejecting. \n\nYOU HAVE EVERY SINGLE RIGHT TO THAT BOUNDARY\n\nI just want you to see what you are telling him, in case you think it\u2019s a small thing that shouldn\u2019t matter at all. If my fianc\u00e9 had this boundary, I would obviously respect it, but it would hurt, and it would take away from the celebration, for me. If my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t normally so against PDA, and I thought they were just embarrassed because of their family, I would probably have a lot of resentment for that family, or I would try to convince my fianc\u00e9 that their opinions shouldn\u2019t dictate our celebration. \n\nBut, I am also an affectionate person in general. I wouldn\u2019t likely be in a relationship with someone who wasn\u2019t comfortable with PDA (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, we just wouldn\u2019t be a good fit). \n\nThat\u2019s why I asked if you are usually against PDA, because if you are, then he shouldn\u2019t be surprised. If you aren\u2019t usually against it, it sounds like you are asking him to change how he celebrates to accommodate your family, not you, and that\u2019s frustrating at a celebration that\u2019s supposed to be about YOUR LOVE.", "Why does OP need to \"meet his needs\" with PDA if she's not confortable? OP clearly stated her boundaries.", "You are allowed to set your boundaries. He has the right to set his own. Now the question is, is any of you willing to compromise?

Let me give you a story to illustrate why. I live in the US and in the US, weddings involve kissing on the mouth. It's part of the wedding ceremony. At my cousin's wedding, her new husband refused to kiss her. The entire congregation, both sides of the family, all the guests and even the minister were shocked that he wouldn't. The minister asked him several times to. There was an audible crowd gasp. It was incredibly uncomfortable and she was in tears. What was so sad is that at most weddings in the US the couple can't get enough kissing and this guy couldn't even make the effort to. They didn't last. While this may not be your culture, you need to understand that this his. His relatives may consider you disrespectful for not kissing him as ours did with my cousin's husband.", "YTA - your husband isn't asking for a lap dance in front of your parents, he's asking to be able to truly kiss his wife at the moment when it's traditional to do so in his culture. \n\nI think asking him to tone down his affection for you at your wedding ceremony to appease your family might be a bad sign for your ability to navigate a multicultural family, but idk.", "If my partner wasn't willing to show PDA at the wedding, I don't know if there would be a wedding. You're having two separate ceremonies to deal with the cultural gap, but there might as well not be two ceremonies and just do an Indian ceremony if you want the Christian ceremony to match with your cultural expectations. You're not an asshole for withholding consent from your partner, generally, but I will make this judgement YTA because it seems that right now you're only making decisions based off what you want and what you think your family wants, and I think you also need to approach your wedding willing to listen to what your husband and husband's family wants too.\n\nIf your family is going to be uncomfortable with seeing you guys kiss and that will make you uncomfortable, can you not see why he might also have the same problem in reverse? That if you two show incredibly less PDA than a normal couple on their wedding day, his family will be uncomfortable through some level of concerned that you two aren't happy to be married which will make him uncomfortable. American weddings very much emphasize the love between the couple to the point of more PDA than normal.\n\nIf you want to marry this man, you need to figure out how you can both be happy with the wedding. Not just focus on pleasing your family.\n\nEDIT: this comment has been made on the assumption that by saying \"*I'm uncomfortable with PDA in front of my family*,\" you don't mean \"*I'm always uncomfortable with PDA generally*.\" Which I think is the most logical read of your wording because A) why would you say \"in front of my family\" if this wasn't about them, and B) because this take seemed to surprise your partner, who would've known if you were just not into PDA by now and shouldn't have been surprised if this was a general opinion. I wouldn't make this same judgement if this was a more general issue that he should've already been aware of and not an issue of who the audience is in particular.", "NAH except your family (a little). I find Indians very judgemental of showing any kind of affection to their partner and that\u2019s not good. They\u2019d be fine watching a man beat his wife on the road but kissing her is where they draw the line. I understand why you\u2019re worried, I\u2019m Indian too. But, it\u2019s his wedding too. It\u2019s literally a celebration of your love. You\u2019re an adult, will be married, may have kids at some point (your family knows how they\u2019re made), will be living together, but kissing at your wedding is not okay for them? Yes, a sloppy make out session would be tacky, but if he wants to hold you close, kiss you longer, grab your waist, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.", "Yta", "YTA.

I also understand your husband\u2019s perspective since weddings are one of the places where PDA is not just accepted but encouraged in his culture.", "YTA.

The expectations would have been clear from the beginning on all sides. \n\nI have been to and worked several traditional Indian weddings and they are very beautiful. I don\u2019t think that you need PDA for a wedding to be intimate, so why waste the extra money on the non Indian wedding if they make the PDA aspects uncomfortable for you?\n\nJust to save you some issues at the reception if you have a large American crowd coming - try to find a way to get the guests not to tap their glasses (or ring bells) to have the newlyweds kiss. It's one of the more annoying parts of wedding receptions and could cause some additional discomfort for you.", "NTA\n\nHe is dismissing how you feel. \n\nAnd he is dismissing a culture he didn\u2019t grow up in.", "NTA \u2026 tell him if no one cares what other people think you\u2019re gonna get married in a thong no bra and only sheer lace covering .. then instead of a first dance you\u2019re gonna give him a lap dance \u2026 of course you care.

I hate PDA and I\u2019m uncomfortable witnessing it so it may just be my bias, but I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so important to him. Like you\u2019re already dancing together and having a quick kiss, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re disgusted by him. I do think he\u2019s right that you care too much about the opinions of others, but it\u2019s still a valid boundary to set.", "I\u2019m going with YTA. I get not wanting to do that in the Indian wedding ceremony, that part is your culture and that should be respected. But if you\u2019re expecting him to respect your culture in that wedding then you should respect his in the other Christian wedding. It\u2019s unfair to expect both to be your way. Kissing your spouse and being affection with them in some way is part of weddings here. You\u2019re putting your family\u2019s comfort ahead of your husband\u2019s happiness and ability to show affection during such a special time.

Although I\u2019m inclined to give him more of the benefit of the doubt here because we have a biased narrator and he\u2019s already agreed to your stipulations in an Indian wedding, whereas you\u2019ve not given a lot of information about backing down for the sake of American customs (and no, a peck on the cheek isn\u2019t it.

If I were you, I would sit my fianc\u00e9 down and ask him why he is pushing you to do something that will make you feel so uncomfortable, and why your discomfort doesn't matter to him. Ask him how he would feel if you told him that his discomfort at your wedding didn't matter to you; would he think that's a good way to start your married life together? By disregarding his comfort, preferences, and desires? Presumably not. Point out that you aren't asking for *no* kissing and *no* physical contact; you're merely asking him to exercise a little restraint, out of love and respect for you \u2013 just as you are doing things he wants that you otherwise wouldn't (*e.g.,* kissing at the end of the Western ceremony, first dance, etc.) out of love and respect for him.", "You know that kissing during the wedding is really just an American thing, right? And even a lot of Americans would be nonplussed by the sight of one spouse trying to swallow the other spouse's tongue in public. OP didn't say \"no kissing\"; she just asked for a restrained kiss, in no small part because *OP herself is not comfortable with a lot of PDA.* So what you're really saying here is that OP's discomfort is irrelevant, and her fianc\u00e9's preference for heavy PDA should win out over OP's preference for restraint. That's really not a great way to start a marriage, in my opinion.", "Well, people getting married usually do so because they are in love. Being all over each other is the point!

He's right to be hurt and upset, for sure. I think the bride ought to be looking for ways to balance out his hurt feelings. \n\nBut at the end of the day, 'no' is a dealbreaker in a way that 'yes' is not. I really don't want to take this line of speculation too far, because I don't think the OP's post is suggesting anything like this, but generally when one person refuses a sexual advance and the other person insists, we're talking about truly immoral behavior. It disturbs me that so many \\*commenters\\* aren't flinching away from their own suggestions. \n\nThe bride's discomfort is conditioned and deep-seated; she can't make it go away. Even if she agrees, she will be unhappy and uncomfortable if her groom kisses her in public. If he insists, he will knowingly make her feel shame and humiliation and probably a laundry list of other bad things. \n\nWhich means that he's looking at a lose/lose situation: either he loses out on a kiss, or he gets an awful kiss that, if he is an even vaguely decent person, he will regret for the rest of his life.

There's a lot of space that they could work within between a totally typical western wedding as I've always attended them (deep kisses at the ceremony, clinking glasses = kisses, the groom taking off the bride's garter with his teeth, ect) and the amount of PDA featured in Disney's Snow White (read: one impersonal kiss). Something else to keep in mind is as far as she's expressed this is an issue with her Indian family being present, not her normal preferred amount of PDA in a western setting. I don't think people would be responding as they are if OP just said she was a very reserved person not comfortable with PDA in general, her wording definitely seems to imply she's only got this issue due to the presence of her family.", "So what it's just an American thing?

Please point out where that is a rule.\n\n The two cultural ceremonies are for getting married in both cultures/religions. Indian (or i assume hindu here) weddings often consist of numerous religious rituals to be officially considered married. I assume that Christian ceremonies have their own rituals (the vows, the kiss, whatever) to make their marriage legal as per religious law as well. It makes sense to have two weddings as the rituals and customs are so different from each other.\n\nThis is a matter of confort. OP is not confortable and that should be the end of story.

It\u2019s just another party.\n\nThe best solution I have is to warn the older family members ahead of time to be respectful of western culture, the same as they\u2019re observing Indian culture at the other wedding. They will gossip, but hopefully OP keeps them at a distance so it won\u2019t matter. (though I don\u2019t get the idea that she does)", "If she's not thinking about cultural gaps, she should start doing so, because they're causing conflicts in her relationship. Her partner should too, but he's not the one dictating his culture on *both* ceremonies right now and not here for us to criticize.\n\nI also do agree with you about solution. The best solution imo would be to warn her Indian family members that the second ceremony is a completely Christian wedding just like the other ceremony was a completely Indian wedding, which means she'll be following more western cultural norms than at a typical \"western wedding\" part of an Indian wedding, and that she expects them to respect her husband's culture at the wedding just like she expects her husband's family to respect her culture at theirs. And that she won't be offended at all if they only chose to go to one of the weddings if they're uncomfortable with a real Christian wedding's norms.\n\nAnd honestly if she's comfortable with PDA but not with any in front of her Indian family ever, and they haven't got to the point of planning where they're handing out invitations, I'm wondering if they can't just separate the ceremonies completely, down to different guest lists? Christian wedding with only western friends and his family, Indian ceremony with her family and any Indian friends she has traveling for it? Maybe only with the very closest of family members at both?\n\nI'm saying all this on the assumption that OP's repeated wording that she's \"uncomfortable with PDA in front of \\[her\\] family\" means what it implies, which is NOT that she's not as uncomfortable with PDA *regardless of who that public is.* That she is okay with PDA when the public isn't her Indian family. If OP is more generally reserved and is always uncomfortable with any PDA regardless of audience, I think she should just come out and say that it's a general issue and not about the presence of her family, because I would personally have a very different judgement if that's the case."]}
