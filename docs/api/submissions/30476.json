He needs the extra space for his own safety and peace of mind. \n\nI sometimes need it when I have low blood sugar as it's a lot easier when I have a handrail to hold onto to maneuver and stay upright. If it's just a cubicle wall I sometimes fall a bit or smack into it (again, scaring the people nearby). \n\nMy trans friend will also often use the disabled bathroom. She's in an uncomfortable place where men will view her as a woman but women will view her as a man so neither gendered bathroom feels comfortable or safe for her. A disabled bathroom is the only real solution for her. \n\nAnother friend uses a colostemy bag and appreciates the privacy of a disabled bathroom to empty it. He doesn't need the extra space but finds it incredibly embarrassing to do so in a shared bathroom while he's still getting used to the process of using it.

I can sympathize with that. What\u2019s important is make sure there aren\u2019t anyone with physical disabilities who need the bathroom *first*. If you had been in the stall for 5+ minutes and a person in a wheelchair or with a cane was outside, that would be bad. If you\u2019re in there for 1 minute and no one is waiting, it\u2019s not as big of a deal. BUT GENERALLY the rule of thumb is that handicap stalls are for people who would struggle using normal stalls, such as people in wheelchairs, crutches, pregnant women, people with service dogs, etc. \n\nIf I am out and not using a wheelchair, I go into a normal stall even though I am physically disabled. Why? It\u2019s an invisible disability and there very well could be someone who is in a wheelchair and *cannot* use any other stall.

If that's not you, I'm afraid you will have to stand in line sometimes.", "With the risk of sounding callous, everybody has to wait for a stall at some point. If it's occupied, you just have to wait. Women, especially in busy places, have a line while the men's bathroom is free and clear most of the time.", "It should, but I've been waiting for it sometimes and someone is just sitting in the handicapped stall taking a break from people.  Yeah, that break might be needed, but when it's the only place a person with a handicap can pee, it's not the right place for a break.", "Oh man, I was thinking of an ace bandage! Yeah definitely don\u2019t change the bandage for an open wound on a baby changing station!! I take it back!", "You are not getting it.  The point is she CAN'T sight HIPPA because HIPPA doesn't apply to them, so she's not going to trust them with her medical information.", "I'm not lying to myself. I'm secure. Had theoretical cancer, would not recommend. I simply look at it as a strength, as I do with all my physical limitations and mental illnesses. They only show how strong I am.", "Again, our disabilities and flaws are what we make of them. If someone can't accept their own permanent disabilities for what they are, how are they ever going to accept themselves?\n\nMy opinion is just as valid as yours, it sounds like you need some self-love yourself and maybe you wouldn't be having an emotional response over something you're telling me has nothing to do with you.", "Again, I left it open to interpretation, I never said they couldn't use it myself. Because it's designed to have the room for those with mobility issues?", "I never said mental disabilities weren't disabilities??? I said that acting like this was intended for someone with purely mental/emotional/neurological disabilities is just grandstanding lol. LOTS of people are uncomfortable using public restrooms. Those are reserved for people who are just uncomfortable but for people for whom it is IMPOSSIBLE to use a regular stall. You ever tried to help someone use a public restroom in a REGULAR stall? I can guarantee you that that person is WAY more uncomfortable that OP will ever be in there.", "Those bathrooms are for everyone, disabilities or not.  Businesses are just required to have a stall that disabled people are able to use.", "And what legal argument am I making there???", "try looking harder. or ask your mom to help, she'll find it instantly", "*healthy Coping mechanisms sold separately", "Ask your Dr if overwhelming dread and heart palpitations are right for you!", "Aw I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. I also had open abdominal surgery as a teen. No one ever called me out on being young in an accessible bathroom back then but I would have RELISHED doing the same in a heartbeat if they had.", "And even a disabled parking pass doesn't guarantee a spot, just more access to it than the average person.", "That's great for you, not everyone has the same experience.", "Wtf is \u201ctheoretical cancer\u201d?", "Nope not sold just because I\u2019m not disabled doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know that telling someone to suck it up no matter how I phrase it is the answer. \n\nI would rather be this passionate about something that doesn\u2019t affect me now and maybe make sure that any future relations of mine aren\u2019t affected, than not say anything.", "It's also designed for people who need added privacy. It's just as much for them as for people with mobility issues.", "My mom and my fianc\u00e9e can find whatever I\u2019m looking for in 5 second flat lmao. I can look for hours with no luck, but the second I ask for help whatever I was looking for materializes", "Heh. Who do you think gave it to me in the first place?\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc80", "Damn that\u2019s the one I needed!!!", "\ud83e\uddf8\ud83e\uddf8\ud83e\uddf8\ud83e\uddf8\ud83e\uddf8\ud83e\uddf8\ud83e\uddf8", "I never said they do. How is cancer great? Interesting take.", "It's yet to be confirmed by science. Thus, theoretical. Waiting on results. I can only go with what I've seen of cancer, and theoretically, I was absolutely experiencing it myself.", "I'm not trying to sell my opinion?? Now I'm confused.\n\nAgain, you sound like you need to work on yourself and value yourself a bit more.\n\nPlease leave me alone. I don't like the block feature itself, if it gets to that it will be temporary but I'm not about negative vibes myself. Let's instead, agree to disagree.", "tell me about it, i used to get in trouble for that lol", "Yea, I totally said cancer was great and not that it was great that you see yourself as stronger.  Yay cancer.", "You simply didn't specify, why are you being sarcastic now? Cancer isn't a joke itself."]}
