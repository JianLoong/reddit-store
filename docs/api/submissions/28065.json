We are incredulous, and we don\u2019t plan to go.", "selftext": "**Edit:**  Thanks everyone for your input! You helped me realize IATA!  So I am gonna reach out to Bubba based on your advice and clear the air. No guilt or shaming, just loving communication. I\u2019ll update this post on how it goes.\n\n\nAITA? My husband & I had planned a family outing on the lake boating with my nephew \"Bubba\" (37), his wife & kids, along with other family. Bubba initially called to cancel due to a planned shoulder surgery as it would likely be too soon to go while recovering. I agreed and told him I would call and move the reservation another month away, so he would have more time to recover. However, by chance my husband saw a FB post by Bubba 3 days in advance of the outing revealing that he rescheduled the surgery for the same day as our outing (which was fine) but he never informed us (which imo was rude as hell as the boat rental was considerable $).\n\n  \nDespite being a bit pissed, we just chose to let it go, as we also had a big trip to Yellowstone for our 40th wedding anniversary planned with him and the family coming up. We then learned from my brother (his father) that Bubba might not be able to go due to financial issues. So we offered to help him with the trip so he could still go. However he never responded to our text message.\n\n  \nUp till the day we left, they never did respond. They just completely ghosted us. I was pretty upset about this, but my brother said, \"You just have to let it go. It's not anything you've done; my children are just terrible communicators. They do the same thing to me, it drives me crazy sometimes!\"\n\n  \nAfter the trip, at a family BBQ my brother held, neither Bubba nor his wife brought up the boat outing, Yellowstone, our anniversary, or apologized in any way. Most of the time, he sat on the couch focused on his phone. He did, however, give me a hug on the way out the door and a verbal \"love you.\"\n\n  \nSo, after a long discussion my husband & I came to the conclusion that neither Bubba nor his wife really cared about us or our feelings. We were simply a nuisance that they had to navigate. So for our sanity, we decided we wouldn't shun them of course, but we would no longer go out of our way to pursue a relationship with them, as it would only lead to further heartache. We kept friends with them on FB, but removed them from our feeds, as it was just too painful seeing their posts all the time.\n\n  \nHowever, out of the blue, I just got a text from Bubba, personally inviting us to his 10th-anniversary celebration via FB. Wow. Both my husband & I are incredulous. They completely ghost our invite for our 40th anniversary in every way possible, and then turn around and want us to celebrate their 10th! I responded \"thanks\" to be polite, and then on FB, I chose \"Maybe\" on their invitation, as I am hoping for an apology. Cause hey, if you apologize to us before your anniversary for ghosting us on ours, I'd be happy to go. Just one apology is all I need. Even if it sounded insincere as hell, I\u2019d accept it and never bring up the issue again.\n\nSo by not going, unless there is an apology, are we the assholes? Or are we supposed to be okay with this? I don't want to be an ahole so I am reaching out to Reddit for an unbiased opinion.", "created_utc": 1696242522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xt1hj/aita_my_nephew_ghosts_us_on_our_40th_wedding/", "score": 2220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t want to go, then don\u2019t go.

Why are you so insistent that he attends to the point you changed the date just for him?", "It doesn't sound like they ever accepted your invitation though? You ,make it sound as though you invited them, they accepted and you made al the bookings and they didn't show, whereas based on what you've written, they never said they would be coming and didn't ask you to move the date.\n\nAnd it doesn't sound as though you have ever done or said anything to let them know you felt insulted or thought that you are owed an apology, you are just expecting them to guess.\n\nCould they have done better? Sure. They should have responded to your invitation / told you if they wouldn't be able to make it, but equally, you could have communicated more clearly (and for things like the boat it's sensible to say \"We need to finalize the booking and the costs depend on how many come, so we need a definite yes or no by \\[date\\] \"\n\nThe fact that they didn't mention it at the BBQ may well have been because , from their perspective, they'd told you they couldn't come due to the op, and hadn't accepted any further invitation, so assumed (not unreasonable) that you were not expecting them. \n\nIt sounds as though they aren't particularly close to you but do view you with affection - your nephew said 'love you' when he last saw you, and they have taken the trouble to invite you to their party.\n\nEither go, enjoy the event, and accept that they probably aren't going to follow your expectations about explicit communication and that anything other than a \"Thank you, we'll be there\" in response to an invitation likely means they won't be there, or chose to treat it as a slight and don't go, but I very much doubt, given what you have said, that they will 'get' the message that you're trying to send. If you say 'maybe' or 'no' and don't go, they will likely take that as face value that you simply weren't available. They aren't going to guess is code for \"I feel you slighted us by not coming to an event you haven't accepted an invitation for, so I am not attending your event in retaliation and will continue to do so until either you apologise for not reading my mind, or I die, whichever happens first\"\n\nIF you were upset, use your words and tell them, but don't make a bit accusation of it , just say \"Because I'd told you I would move the date for our outing, I had understood you would be coming. We were disappointed you couldn't make it, but also wound up paying for your spot. I appreciate you won't always be able to come to our events, and that maybe we didn't communicate clearly enough , but could you please let us know definitely if you can't attend, in future, to avoid similar issues? \"\n\nThat may or may not work but at least you will have let them know and made the request, and they may apologise for their share in the miscommunication. \n\nAssuming you haven't done any of that, then yah, YTA (also, did it occur to you that he might be stressed out by the fact he needed surgery and that your party was maybe not at the top of his list of priorities? Did you ever actually ask him if he and his family were free on the new date or wanted to come? )", "I bet Bubba sleeps well at night, oblivious to all this drama. I don't know his story, it seems flaky and a bit rude to not respond to your message. But life with three kids is busy and perhaps it wasn't malicious. However, despite your brother telling you that's just how they are and not to take it personally, you've decided to create your own interpretation. If you genuinely want to get past this, tell him how you feel, that you'd really wanted to make sure he could attend if he wanted your events , and it hurt you that he never acknowledged your offer. Maybe then you'll either find out more or get your apology. But if you prefer to silently stew so that you can not get an apology Bubba doesn't necessarily realise he owes, so that you can not attend an event for spite he's not aware of, then go right ahead.", "Info: did he ask you to move the date of the boat rental or did you decide to do that yourself? \n\nAs for Yellowstone, if he was going through financial problems, it was probably embarrassing for him that a) his father disclosed those issues to you in the first place\u2014could\u2019ve been a betrayal of confidence, or b) that you brought it up in a text message. It can be hard for people to feel like others are pitying them. Tbh, it doesn\u2019t sound like y\u2019all are that close to \u201cBubba\u201d so he may not be comfortable with you guys offering to pay or knowing his financial status.", "The postponement of the surgery might be due to factors out of his control, and he wouldn't want to put it off further. He might be embarrassed to have someone pay for him and his family. I do think he should communicate better. I would tell him that it helps plan things better. However, inviting you to the anniversary shows he does care, even though he's got issues to work on. If I were you, I'd attend.", "Info: have you told bubba exactly how you felt about his not going to your 40th or to the boat outing?     \n\nNot, \"Bummer, I really wanted you there,\" but , \"You're important to me, and I had really wanted you there, so I felt hurt when you didn't come.\"", "I suspect you would have been equally incredulous if he hadn\u2019t invited you to his party. Was it rude not to respond to you? Yes. However, you have taken a small faux pas and turned it into a relationship ending crisis he\u2019s probably not even aware of. Move on. You\u2019re creating unnecessary pain for yourself by harboring this grudge. And try to have a little empathy. He\u2019s going through a lot. It\u2019s not surprising that a Yellowstone vacation is not a priority for him right now", "A gentle YTA.\n\nBubba has his own life, and his life sounds STRESSFUL. Three kids, money problems, a major surgery...??? It sounds like he is very busy and stressed... And like you care more about if he's rsvp'ing to your expectations rather than if he's okay.\n\nDo you know what I would do if a beloved relative were going through all of that and started struggling to participate in the family on top of his problems?\n\nI'd ask him if he's okay. I'd cook dinner and bring it over. I'd ask if I could help watch his kids while he's in recovery.\n\nI wouldn't decide that he is being stressed *AT* me, and that his reasonable preoccupation during a time of major upheaval was a justification to start removing him from my life.\n\nSometimes when you're drowning, you don't have the energy to RSVP. Sometimes when you're drowning, you can't even say \"help, I'm drowning,\" because that would mean less breath is available in your lungs to hold yourself above water.

Ghosting is when you completely stop communicating with someone, ever. They never hear from you again, unless they run into you by accident. When you ghost, you don't hug the person and tell them you love them, and you don't invite them to your 10th anniversary.\n\nWhat he did was decline your invitations. It sounds like in both cases, he gave a reason, which is polite, but in both cases you tried to \"fix\" his reason so he could come anyway, when what he was really saying was just \"no.\" He could have been more direct, but it's usually considered more polite to give a reason when you're declining.\n\nYou, of course, can decline their invitation too and not go. But YTA.", "INFO 1: what did Bubba\u2019s FB post say about the reschedule?\n\nIn my experience, the hospital tells you the day and time to show up and you get exactly 0 input. Then the hospital may change that day and time at will depending on the schedules of the surgeon, anesthesiologist, other specialists, etc. \n\nINFO 2: You say that other family members were invited to these events as well - how big were they? Big enough that Bubba and his family\u2019s absence wouldn\u2019t change the planning logistics? Or small enough that ~4 people\u2019s absence would change your hosting plans a lot?", "Sorry but for someone married 40 years it seems you\u2019ve never grown up past 12, what an unnecessary drama.

He\u2019s clearly having some financial issues and he was having what sounds like a major surgery.

I don't travel well and get anxiety going anywhere, doubly so when I had kids, and triple that when low on funds.\n\nBe the example to him of grace, understanding and forgiveness. I 100% understand how you are hurt, but maybe quietly speak to him face to face saying that you'd like to spend time together and if there is a way to make that happen, without the pressure of a full trip somewhere. \n\nNTA but if you refuse to show up and never speak to him then YWBTA and lose out on a relationship with him/them, which is a loss for everyone.", "YTA.

Don\u2019t rely on your brother other people to be the messager.\n\nI would also think about this less as a punitive situation and more like a difference in needs/wants.\n\nYour nephew doesn\u2019t communicate well and is potentially unreliable, although I question that considering the high stress of his situation. However, he\u2019s at least unreliable for now.\n\nKnowing *that*, and knowing you can\u2019t change other people\u2026what you want to do?\n\nIf you still want to spend time with him then do that.

Did you talk to your brother about what you could do so you could help without hurting your nephew\u2019s pride?\n\nI\u2019m not saying you have to do *any* of that. What I am trying to point out is that your nephew seems to be in a really difficult place. If the only time he\u2019s hearing from you is when you want him to do something (spend time and energy seeing you) and the only time you offer help is for something that also benefits you (paying for a vacation) then I understand you not being on top of his priority list, because he\u2019s not on top of yours either.", "YTA\n\nYou need to take an entire step back and realize that Bubba is not living his life at you. He has 3 kids, financial issues, and a surgery. He also has days of life events he has to deal with that you are not  a part of.\n\nIs Bubba forgetful and probably a bit rude in how he communicated? Yes. But from Bubba's perspective he told you he couldn't make your event, RSVP no, and then something happened and the surgery either was or had to be rescheduled. There was no reason to continue communicating with you once he had said no to the trip. \n\nYellowstone is the same thing. He had said no.\n\nHe did not ghost you. He said no with a reason then went about living/scheduling his life. It would have been nice to respond to your offer of paying. But he might have missed it, or been uncomfortable.\n\nYou have taken him saying no to invitations and not being sociable at a family get together and decided he does not care about you or your spouse and never cared. That is exhausting behavior to deal with from the other side because from Bubba's perspective he is treading water in a busy and stressful life and wasn't feeling to sociable at a family BBQ. \n\nIf you have an issue with Bubba, tell him. But bluntly, do not accuse him of never caring about you because he has done nothing to justify that accusation.", "I think you need to talk to them. The man had a damaged surgery that was bad enough to need surgery. He was rude and he really should have kept you in the loop but he may have had other things on his mind. Did his presence or lack really affect the boat trip considering you were having it with other family? He's been juggling a lot of balls = surgery, children, employment(?), poor finances. Helping with the trip was a really nice gesture but time-off after sick leave could have put work at risk. Never put down to malice that which can be put down to stupidity or just being over-whelmed.", "Maybe he's just not that into you.

And other obligations besides a boat party (house upkeep, chores etc).  \n\nIt simply may not have been a huge event on his radar.  As other have said,  it's an invitation not a court summons.  Did he *ask* you to move the date?  Did you ask about the second date to see if that was workable with his schedule?  \n\nI know for surgeries that the surgery dates are picked by the surgeon and depending on the patients schedule they may not have any options.

Your post and comments give the impression that you feel slighted because you are looking for reasons to feel slighted. Not everything is about you, and that\u2019s the way that it should be.  You are family to your nephew first, and yet his wife still seems active in coordinating for your side; instead of seeing that, you for some reason still blame her for wanting to spend time with her family, when any \u201cblame\u201d should be laid at your nephew\u2019s feet for not prioritising his own family; and it also means that you think you get to have an opinion on how they spend their time, which you do not.

Because it sounds downright unhinged to believe that someone would reschedule shoulder surgery to avoid a party when they could just as easily say \"No\", and already had said \"No\". \n\nProbably, the surgery got rescheduled, and they were too busy reorganizing their own lives around it that they forgot to RSVP No for a SECOND time.

My husband & I had planned a family outing on the lake boating with my nephew \"Bubba\" (37), his wife & kids, along with other family. Bubba initially called to cancel due to a planned shoulder surgery as it would likely be too soon to go while recovering. I agreed and told him I would call and move the reservation another month away, so he would have more time to recover. However, by chance my husband saw a FB post by Bubba 3 days in advance of the outing revealing that he rescheduled the surgery for the same day as our outing (which was fine) but he never informed us (which imo was rude as hell as the boat rental was considerable $).\n\n  \nDespite being a bit pissed, we just chose to let it go, as we also had a big trip to Yellowstone for our 40th wedding anniversary planned with him and the family coming up. We then learned from my brother (his father) that Bubba might not be able to go due to financial issues. So we offered to help him with the trip so he could still go. However he never responded to our text message.\n\n  \nUp till the day we left, they never did respond. They just completely ghosted us. I was pretty upset about this, but my brother said, \"You just have to let it go. It's not anything you've done; my children are just terrible communicators. They do the same thing to me, it drives me crazy sometimes!\"\n\n  \nAfter the trip, at a family BBQ my brother held, neither Bubba nor his wife brought up the boat outing, Yellowstone, our anniversary, or apologized in any way. Most of the time, he sat on the couch focused on his phone. He did, however, give me a hug on the way out the door and a verbal \"love you.\"\n\n  \nSo, after a long discussion my husband & I came to the conclusion that neither Bubba nor his wife really cared about us or our feelings. We were simply a nuisance that they had to navigate. So for our sanity, we decided we wouldn't shun them of course, but we would no longer go out of our way to pursue a relationship with them, as it would only lead to further heartache. We kept friends with them on FB, but removed them from our feeds, as it was just too painful seeing their posts all the time.\n\n  \nHowever, out of the blue, I just got a text from Bubba, personally inviting us to his 10th-anniversary celebration via FB. Wow. Both my husband & I are incredulous. They completely ghost our invite for our 40th anniversary in every way possible, and then turn around and want us to celebrate their 10th! I responded \"thanks\" to be polite, and then on FB, I chose \"Maybe\" on their invitation, as I am hoping for an apology. Cause hey, if you apologize to us before your anniversary for ghosting us on ours, I'd be happy to go. Just one apology is all I need. Even if it sounded insincere as hell, I\u2019d accept it and never bring up the issue again.\n\n  \nSo by not going, unless there is an apology, are we the assholes? Or are we supposed to be okay with this? I don't want to be an ahole so I am reaching out to Reddit for an unbiased opinion.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So it's not very easy to schedule an nonemergency surgery exactly when you want it. And if the surgery had to be canceled and rescheduled last minute, he probably had even less choice because other days were booked.

The medical center schedules procedures based on how they fit into the dr\u2019s schedule, so the patient may have zero input about when they are put on the schedule. My dad made it very clear that he *could not* be scheduled before Nov 1, so he is scheduled for something like 5am Nov 2. Then there\u2019s also the chance that something happened regarding the dr\u2019s availability for the original appointment and it once again gets scheduled by the medical center and now the postponed date of the anniversary celebration, which was probably free at the time you decided to reschedule, ends up being when they rescheduled him to.\n\nIt definitely sucks when you want the people who are important to you at your celebration, but sometimes life gets in the way and times that were thought to work for everyone end up not working out after all. If you really do have a good relationship with your nephew and his family, they might truly have felt bad that they weren\u2019t able to celebrate too. Especially since you attempted to make sure that the hurdle of being unable to afford it was something that you didn\u2019t want them worrying about because you really wanted them to be there. \n\nAs for the lack of communication, when a major thing like a surgery gets rescheduled, things such as childcare for the kids, days off work, and a whole bunch of other household things also have to be rescheduled. When you are so busy trying to make sure that you have covered all the bases for your regular life, sometimes things like an invite to a celebration fall through the cracks. It probably wasn\u2019t a slight toward you and just the product of an overwhelmed couple doing the best they could. \n\nAs for you not wanting them to miss out on things, it\u2019s fine to do so in the planning stages, but people miss out on things all the time for a lot of reasons and have learned how to handle the disappointment of it. You really don\u2019t need to hold onto the disappointment that they missed out for them.

I'm around Bubba's age and in a similar life stage. My parents and in-laws often respond as you do: if I (or my husband) say we can't make something, they ask a hundred questions to \"solve\" the problem. Suddenly, the invitation becomes a mandate: you *will* go do this thing with us, and we will make it happen. We have said, in the past, \"while that sounds fun, we don't have the capacity for that right now\" or \"we're not really interested,\" and then people are offended: \"you don't want to spend time with us?\" or \"well, you did XYZ with other side of the family!\"  \n\n\nSometimes when people have a lot going on (kids, health issues, job stuff, finances), they just need to *rest*. They need their one free weekend to stay free. They've been with people 24/7 and need to recuperate. It's not that they don't love you, they just need a break (and chasing kids around a party or boat is not a break). I know your 40th anniversary is important to you, but in the shuffle of everyday life, it might not be a priority to them. And that has to be OK - that their priorities are different and it's not a rejection. I care about my extended family, but there's a hundred things that have to come first so I can keep my head above water day-to-day.  \n\n\nFor awhile we did what Bubba did: when things started getting moved around, we'd just stop responding. Or we'd vaguely say \"maybe sometime\" or \"let us know\" and before we knew it, it was assumed that we'd fully committed, and people were offended. To us, it was letting them down easy - we didn't want to say \"no, we don't want to\" because we knew it would turn into a *thing* with all of the older generation talking about us behind our backs. Other times, chaos would happen and it would slip our minds (for example, everyone gets COVID - a party is not going to be the priority as we sort out logistics, or a surgery gets rescheduled - that's a lot to deal with at once \\[time off work, who has the kids, transport, etc\\], an \"texting my aunt\" is forgotten).   \n\n\nAnyway, what I do now with my side of the family is just say \"no, thanks\" and refuse to elaborate because I do not want the guilt trips, frantic urges to re-schedule \"around our schedule\" or weird unspoken dynamics that I was never aware of.

Don't be those people.   \n\n\nBased on age, it's likely you're retired (or close to it), and based on activities you're at least financially comfortable.

What you have in your mind is some older white guy yelling at kids to stay off his lawn.  This behavior is not universal, or even majority for the boomer generation.
