Was working as a hostess..we were a pretty big, popular place and wait times could go to 2+ hours. So we had a machine that one of us would just keep walking around the restaurant, doing rounds and sending info on this machine back info to the main desk whenever a table was free for being seated at.\n\nAt some point I noticed a lady looking at me evil eye...my next time around noticed it again...went to the table cause Im thinking they havnt been helped / she needed something and was annoyed no one was coming to the table.  She curtly told me they want nothing from me and I was like..mm...okay fine whatever, kept doing my rounds.\n\nNext time around, she completely lost it, told me she was sick of me coming around just to take a look at her man, that he is there with her and I need to back off and never come near their table again. But like...loud, and way more words, and cursing was involved. I was standing there stunned for a sec...but didnt say anything, just...kept doing my rounds.  I was dreading come back around to their table, and yup, she had her eye out for me, and as soon as she saw me, got in my face and LOST IT. \n\nSo like..Im not emotional..Im beyond chill and nothing ever gets to me buuuuut... I was a single mom, broke af, working double shifts nearly every day, exhausted and I just broke. I just burst into tears...not me AT ALL but Im standing there crying, my manager races out to see WTF is going on. All he knew was I was standing there in tears with this woman screaming, he took my device, told me to go take a break, and I dipped.\n\nApparently, after I left and shes going off about how I keep coming around to check her man out, he held up the device and told her I was doing my job checking tables, told them to leave immediately. She started going off on how theyll never come back and he said they better not cause they were now banned.  \n\nI feel sorry for the bf, he looked like he wanted to dig a hole and crawl right into it from the time she was just giving me evil eye...but not \\*that\\* bad..he chose to date her afterall.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t put him down at all.

Well, the man in the relationship was always friendly, and she was less so. One day, he made a joke and I laughed and she later made a complaint to my boss about me acting inappropriately with a customer (flirting).

Their waiter is a male. Who because of the month, is wearing a pride pin. Doesn\u2019t mean he is gay. I have worn pins during pride month and stuff like that before. But back to the date\u2026.the female notices the pride pin and automatically assumes that the waiter is gay. She is openly hostile. He ignores it and still tries to give superior service. At which time she berates him saying to back off and that just because the waiter is attracted to him doesn\u2019t mean he can hover all over him. The waiter is taken aback. Only then remembers he has a pride pin on. So probably not gay. And either way in a happy relationship. At this point the insecure female has been hostile, rude, and is now trying to embarrass and shame him. So he replies. He responds that he doesn\u2019t find the guy attractive and he is in a happy relationship. Now, most guys I know that are straight don\u2019t find other guys attractive. Most straight guys I know who are told they are/are not attractive by someone who is gay really doesn\u2019t care. At this point because of the woman\u2019s behavior, the waiter is done. He doesn\u2019t approach until time to pay. So that insecure woman has now cost both of them the excellent service they were getting due to her childish actions. Apparently the guy was not offended as he left a big tip versus a small/no tip. \n\nNTA. You said you forgot in the moment you were working and had a disrespectful tone.

I went from being a waitress to working on an ambulance. I get treated even more like shit now but for the most part I can respond as wanted. I can\u2019t go off or do something stupid but if you are being abusive in any way (including verbally) then you won\u2019t be riding on my truck. That is a big rule I have. I don\u2019t tolerate people abusing me or my partner. I picked up a second job serving again and realized I got to comfortable in responding rather than smiling and just taking it.", "I agree. Dropping the professional persona was probably the right thing to do here, socially. It doesn't even sound like he was particularly aggressive about it -- it's not like he said that the guy was particularly ugly. If this was a high-class kind of place then maybe, but in a local diner people should really see the waitstaff as regular people and not servants (ideally it would be the same in a high-class environment, but that's just not how it is right now).", "Not disagreeing with your comment, but I was at a restaurant years ago with my girlfriend at the time, who though thoroughly heterosexual as far as I could determine had a boyish haircut, and gave off a fairly gay vibe to be fair. In the course of passing the wine bottle over to the shelf on the other side ofthe table past my gf our waitress delivered the most explicit and brazen boob graze to my girlfriend's head that it is possible to imagine.  We both agreed after she had left, and did not make an issue of it. (It was not just wishful thinking and filthiness on my part). Sadly not an invitation that I was in a position to capitalise on in that relationship. I suppose my point is that there are a small but non-zero percentage of servers who are willing to give it a go.", "He probably felt bad for the boy.", "There\u2019s no need to comment on his looks at all. He\u2019s just sitting there. Why say it at all? He didn\u2019t feel offended but that was after the fact. That played no part in OPs decision", "You couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.
