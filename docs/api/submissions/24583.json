Was working as a hostess..we were a pretty big, popular place and wait times could go to 2+ hours. So we had a machine that one of us would just keep walking around the restaurant, doing rounds and sending info on this machine back info to the main desk whenever a table was free for being seated at.\n\nAt some point I noticed a lady looking at me evil eye...my next time around noticed it again...went to the table cause Im thinking they havnt been helped / she needed something and was annoyed no one was coming to the table.  She curtly told me they want nothing from me and I was like..mm...okay fine whatever, kept doing my rounds.\n\nNext time around, she completely lost it, told me she was sick of me coming around just to take a look at her man, that he is there with her and I need to back off and never come near their table again. But like...loud, and way more words, and cursing was involved. I was standing there stunned for a sec...but didnt say anything, just...kept doing my rounds.  I was dreading come back around to their table, and yup, she had her eye out for me, and as soon as she saw me, got in my face and LOST IT. \n\nSo like..Im not emotional..Im beyond chill and nothing ever gets to me buuuuut... I was a single mom, broke af, working double shifts nearly every day, exhausted and I just broke. I just burst into tears...not me AT ALL but Im standing there crying, my manager races out to see WTF is going on. All he knew was I was standing there in tears with this woman screaming, he took my device, told me to go take a break, and I dipped.\n\nApparently, after I left and shes going off about how I keep coming around to check her man out, he held up the device and told her I was doing my job checking tables, told them to leave immediately. She started going off on how theyll never come back and he said they better not cause they were now banned.  \n\nI feel sorry for the bf, he looked like he wanted to dig a hole and crawl right into it from the time she was just giving me evil eye...but not \\*that\\* bad..he chose to date her afterall.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t put him down at all.

Well, the man in the relationship was always friendly, and she was less so. One day, he made a joke and I laughed and she later made a complaint to my boss about me acting inappropriately with a customer (flirting).

Their waiter is a male. Who because of the month, is wearing a pride pin. Doesn\u2019t mean he is gay. I have worn pins during pride month and stuff like that before. But back to the date\u2026.the female notices the pride pin and automatically assumes that the waiter is gay. She is openly hostile. He ignores it and still tries to give superior service. At which time she berates him saying to back off and that just because the waiter is attracted to him doesn\u2019t mean he can hover all over him. The waiter is taken aback. Only then remembers he has a pride pin on. So probably not gay. And either way in a happy relationship. At this point the insecure female has been hostile, rude, and is now trying to embarrass and shame him. So he replies. He responds that he doesn\u2019t find the guy attractive and he is in a happy relationship. Now, most guys I know that are straight don\u2019t find other guys attractive. Most straight guys I know who are told they are/are not attractive by someone who is gay really doesn\u2019t care. At this point because of the woman\u2019s behavior, the waiter is done. He doesn\u2019t approach until time to pay. So that insecure woman has now cost both of them the excellent service they were getting due to her childish actions. Apparently the guy was not offended as he left a big tip versus a small/no tip. \n\nNTA. You said you forgot in the moment you were working and had a disrespectful tone.

I'm not saying that she didn't deserve to be told that, but if you work with the public you do have to let a lot of this shit go. I used to ask myself \"is this worth losing my job over?\" whenever I wanted to say something back to a rude customer. Some things are, for example, I spoke up and told a customer to leave the store because they were being shitty with a coworker (someone who was definitely not the type to stand up for himself) and bordering on abusive. They tried starting on me and I told them that either they leave or I call security. They then tried to complain about me because I swore - not at them, but when explaining I was asking them to leave for being shitty to my coworker - my boss listened to their story, I admitted I had sworn and said why. She turned to the customers and told them to fuck off \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 So, for me, if everything had gone differently and I would have been fired I would have been pissed that my work allowed that abuse but I wouldn't have done it any different if given a do-over.

Most of the time though the stuff rude people say isn't worth the possible ramifications.\n\nWhat I will say is that you managed to tell the customer to fuck off, without  actually telling her to fuck off, which I am always a fan of! \ud83d\ude02 I do feel a bit sorry for her boyfriend though, poor dude had to sit there while his gf sat there seething over something that never even happened, then be embarrassed when she got shitty with you in public and then get told that some random stranger thinks he's unattractive \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Probably not the evening he thought he was going to have! \ud83d\ude02\n\nLastly, I don't understand and have never understood, why people get annoyed at someone finding their partner attractive or flirting with them. Ok it's a little different if it's happening right in front of them as it is rude and disrespectful but still, do they expect themselves to be the only person on the planet to find their OH attractive? Unless you are worried that your OH will cheat because someone else finds them sexy then why worry about it?

Her definitely, the boyfriend because he did not cut her off for being rude and you because you  went for the guy looks by calling him unattractive. \n\n\u00ab\u00a0Not my type\u00a0\u00bb would have been more neutral (not telling the guy he is unattractive) while still being to the point.", "the manager did the right thing. that sort of behaviour should not be tolerated.", "It\u2019s sad that the low effort fictional post got so many upvotes.", "Not only unattractive but a red flag of bizarre unwarranted jealousy straight out of left field\n\nI'd be so ???? if a date of mine suddenly went from 0 to 100 like this. Besides the rudeness which is just not ok\n\nNTA op", "that's not the thing that makes this obviously, screamingly fake", "... and you handled this well beyond your 17 years of age! Keep up the good work. It was a perfect way to handle crazy. NTA", "there is actually a restaurant in Australia where the staff are deliberately rude and semi insulting its part of the experience eating there safe to say its a adult only venue. and the management clearly state that fact and if your thin skinned dont come here.", "You sound exhausting lol", "Um the whole reason she is flirting is because of the tip, that's all she wants from him.", "and if its just a bit of fun nothing wrong with that. aslong as everyone knows thats all it is.\n\ni know a couple who point out the good looking sorts to each other on occasion. its perfectly natural to look. you just dont touch. his thing is a nice rack and a nice set of legs. hers is a nice arse.", "I feel like it doesn't automatically mean she's cheating.  She could be having trouble snagging someone to cheat with, which would only increase her insecurity.", "I think she is homophobic, or at least into stereotypes, which is still a lousy look.\n\nThis woman assumed that every gay man hits on any and every man he meets.  Apparently, for this hypothetical gay man, it doesn't matter if the man is attractive or not, or if  this man is gay, straight, bi or trans.\n\nThat's a lot of insatiable lust the woman is accusing OP of.  And it turns out OP is happy in the relationship he has.", "Then why else would she have made that comment? I doubt OP was actually flirting, so the only possible explanation is that she was offended by the pride flag pin.", "if there's anything I love more than being objectified by random creepy men on the street, it's being objectified by the random creepy couples who do it as a \"bonding activity\"", "you're star struck when you are fascinated or impressed by a famous person :D\n\nyou're either looking for speechless or dumbstruck (so shocked that you don't know what to say)", "It does mean lost for words.... but after you've seen a star (ie someone famous).", "Definition: \"particularly taken with celebrities (such as movie stars)\"", "What are you saying? ESH it was extremely unprofessional. Also I understand your trying to \"get me\" with you speaks volumes comment. If literally one strangers comment breaks you, than there is more going on behind the scenes. Its a sign that your QOL  would benefit from a therapist maybe psychiatrist  if it happens to be somthing more. Idk why you attributed negitive connotations on fragile but it seemed to be an apt word at the time and I stand by it. Mental illness isnt your fault but it is your responsibility.", "Oh, I've been there, a million years ago.  The experience you had with your friends was incredibly painful and they don't seem to get that you're the same person you have always been.\n\nAs they say,  \"Things get better (after high school).  I hope you are finding some happiness in the midst of former friends' homophobia.  Time to collect some more mature and open-minded friends.", "0hh yeah you are right. It wasn't a question about attractiveness,it was an allegation on OP."]}
