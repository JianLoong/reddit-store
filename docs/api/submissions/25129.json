(My apartment is quite small so that was enough to be cramped lol). I called everybody before hand to make sure whatever I was cooking would adhere to dietary restrictions & allergies etc. A few people asked if they were welcome to bring other foods, wine, drinks etc and I said sure.\n\nSo it happened last night and I had basically cooked a scaled down thanksgiving meal, smallish turkey, chicken, potatoes, mac and cheese and salad. I was also expecting other people to bring stuff and almost everyone did, it turned into kind of a potluck situation. \n\nMy brother ended up coming a bit late which isn\u2019t too unusual, but he had a woman who he introduced as his girlfriend in tow. I didn\u2019t really have a problem with it. I was thinking it would\u2019ve been nice for him to tell me she was coming but from the way he explained it it was a last minute decision. \n\nWe\u2019re all standing around my tiny table praying & when we\u2019re done it\u2019s time for food. My brothers girlfriend asked what was vegan at the table and said she\u2019d been eyeing a few things. I said I personally hadn\u2019t cooked anything vegan, but one of my friends who is vegetarian had. It was some kind of stuffed peppers thing. \n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting to have a vegan so I wasn\u2019t prepared but his girlfriend seemed really upset. My brother pulled me aside about an hour after and said it wasn\u2019t really good hosting to only have 1 dish for her to eat. To be fair, she did look sort of left out just eating stuffed peppers and i did feel bad, but when my brother suggested I order her some food to make up for it I said no. \n\nVegan food is quite expensive where I live and I had already gone over my budget for the month with my dinner. I told him he was definitely welcome to order it, but I personally couldn\u2019t afford another $25-$30 on one meal for her. \n\nThere was no big scene or anything, he stayed until the end of the night and she stayed too, i told her she was welcome to raid the fridge because i was sure I had some foods suited to her but she didn\u2019t take me up on that offer. \n\nThis morning however, he called and said that I should\u2019ve at least ordered for her, considering I only had one dish she could eat, and that it was insulting to her being told she could go through the fridge \u201clike some rat or something.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m conflicted, last night I didn\u2019t feel that bad for not ordering but today I do based on what he said and how she felt. AITA?\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not too familiar with Reddit, so feel free to lmk if I haven\u2019t been clear or formatted this wrong. TIA.\n\n\n\nSo this part on is an edit:\n\nI read through most of the comments so far and I\u2019d like to clarify that his girlfriend didn\u2019t say anything mean or demanding to me, and I\u2019m fairly sure she never intended for me to hear the rat thing. She seemed like a sweet girl, just I guess she felt out of place. I appreciate the people giving fair comments but some of you are just being mean to her, which i ask you kindly not to do when giving your opinion.

You don't crash a party, then get mad because nothing is to your liking.   That's not how this works.   If he had given you notice, then you could have prepared a few dishes, but for her to be a literal stranger then get mad because you didn't cook food to her tastes is ridiculous on her part and your brother's.", "NTA. He's the asshole for bringing someone without you knowing and for expecting you to be a mind reader and plan for vegan!", "NTA you can't cook food for people you don't even know exist. Your brother is entitled amd rude. Why didn't he order her food?", "NTA. Why didn't your brother just order her some vegan food since it was his last minute invitee? He's blaming the wrong person..", "NTA.  Your brother should have RSVP\u2019ed for her and he could have ordered her a meal himself", "NTA - beggars (and the uninvited) can't be choosers.  Bro should have sprung for his GF's dinner, the cheapskate.", "NTA. You asked everyone before party about preferences/allergies and prepared food for invited people. Your brother invited his woman without telling you  and he is responsible for her special meal.", "NTA - You asked around to make sure everyone will be accommodated AND everyone had the option to just bring something. It's your brother's fault for not talking to you and his girlfriend. Else you could have prepared something and she could have prepared something herself. No reason to blame you", "NTA. Why didn't bro order her something if he was so concerned? Of COURSE you didn't have vegan food. Most people don't unless there are vegans KNOWN TO BE ATTENDING IN ADVANCE. Bro sprang his vegan gf on you... that's on him to provide her meals. Or on her since she is a grown adult with a chosen dietary restriction.", "NTA. You had no idea she was coming and called around before. If your brother thought this was such a big issue, he would\u2019ve told you when you asked", "NTA\n\nHe showed up with a new GF party crasher. You had no idea of she was coming or her dietary habits\n\nHe's an AH for making a stink", "NTA.  As someone with dietary restrictions, I never show up to an event with food without making sure I can eat.  Whether that\u2019s calling the host to ask if they can accommodate well in advance, or expecting to primarily eat the food I brought at a pot luck, or bringing my own food when people won\u2019t accommodate me but I have to be there (or I couldn\u2019t call ahead), I make sure I have a solid plan for how I\u2019m going to eat.\n\nYour brother\u2019s girlfriend did none of those things.  As coming was a last minute decision, she should\u2019ve at least grabbed herself a heavy snack or light meal and just tucked it in her purse in case she needed it.\n\nIt\u2019s her responsibility to communicate her needs.  You had no idea you were having a vegan guest, so you prepared no vegan food.", "NTA...it would take supernatural powers to guess the needs of an uninvited guest.", "NTA\n\nShe was an unexpected guest, so you didn't have any food prepared specifically for her, and since she did show up unannounced, it was totally on her to make sure she had something to eat. \n\nYou were definitely a good host because it seems like you did your best to prepare a meal that all of the expected guests could enjoy, and that's all you had to do.", "NTA AT ALL! This topic has been brought up again and again, and it's almost always the fault of the judgmental, entitled random vegan GF who just shows up unexpectedly and insists everyone kowtow to her. \n\nYour brother didn't even tell you about her in advance, so how were you supposed to read his mind and realize he was bringing some rando GF with him? \n\nWhy are you even asking this question???", "NTA.  Your brother sounds like TA here.  He should have let you know in advance that she was coming and that she was vegan so that you could plan the meal accordingly; it reads to me like she thought he had, tbh.  It was incredibly rude of him not to do that, to you and to his date (poor girl).  And now he's blaming you instead of taking responsibility for his screw-up; don't fall for it.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't required to make anything you don't want to make. Him bullshitting you as if you're somehow required to make every type of meal there is in order to be a good host is laughable.  \n\nI guess next time I have people over I had better make 4 different pizzas.... One non vegan with red sauce, one non vegan with white sauce, one vegan with red sauce, and one vegan with white sauce.", "Nta\n\nAs a plus one, get bf (your brother)  should have let you know ahead of time that she had a dietary restriction.

Guest had dietary restrictions you were not aware of, if it was important for YOUR BROTHER\u2019S guest to have something to eat, then, he should have ordered it.  Next time she is YOUR guest, I\u2019m sure you will accommodate.", "NTA. She was an unexpected guest and your brother should've gotten her a vegan meal. I've hosted plenty of parties at my house to know you're not going to cook or order everything that everyone likes. The fact he's making you feel shitty is terrible", "NTA. You planned a party and asked for input. Her lack of food is on your brother and his lack of communication. And since it was his fault, he should have had something delivered. The GF also needs to be aware that someone with major restrictions might not be accommodated at the last minute and maybe she should bring a vegan snack bar.", "You didn't even know that your brother's girlfriend existed, or that she was coming, much less that she was vegan. Her lack of food options at your party is entirely on her and your brother. NTA", "NTA\n\nIs there some sort of expectation to cook a vegan dish just in case a vegan turns up?", "NTA. Your brother is though for bringing her and not warning you she was Vegan and then guilting you. Why didn\u2019t he order her something?", "Your brother can fuck off. NTA. He not only brough an uninvited/unexpected guest, but he also then demanded that you bend over backwards to accommodate her dietary preferences. HE could have ordered her food for delivery. SHE could have ordered food for delivery. They could have brought their own food like others. They could have no shown up unannounced.", "NTA. Your brother didn't even ask if he could bring his girlfriend, let alone tell you that she was vegan. You probably should have checked the fridge and made a definite offer of whatever you had, but if that wasn't ok, HE should have ordered her food seeing as he sprung her on you.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to provide for an uninvited guest who you didn't know would be there until after the food was cooked.", "NTA. You didn't know that your brother's gf had a dietary restriction because you weren't told, and made an effort to ask about deitary restrictions, so you did the best you could under the circumstances. On the other hand, I don't think it's jerkish behavour on her part to not eat what you put out due to her ethical convictions. Your brother however is a mildly stinky poophole, since he didn't as far as I can see, offer to contribute to her diet, or at least give a bit of advance notice when bringing a quest on short notice (why couldn't he have brought vegan food), yet was the one that made the suggestion of paying more for vegan food.", "NTA - as a vegan myself I advise hosts ahead of time and that I'm happy to sort myself out if they can't accommodate as it's awkward to avoid things required to keep them separate. She could have done the same.", "NTA- he is though, he should have asked before coming and brought a vegan dish with him - it was a potluck. You\u2019d have to be psychic to know he was bringing her.", "NTA- you weren't warned that you would be hosting a vegan. Your brother should have told you AND brought a dish to share that his gf could enjoy.", "NTA but your brother was. For bringing a guest you didn't know about, and not warning you of any dietary restrictions.", "NTA. Why didn't he order the food? He has a vegan gf that he brought without letting you know this in advance. He is more AH here, not you.", "NTA. Your brother brought an uninvited guest and then has the audacity to think YOU should PAY additional money to feed a complete stranger you just met?!!! If he was so concerned about her comfort level it was his responsibility to do something about it. Why didn\u2019t HE order her food? Your brother is entitled AF, and the only RUDE person in this situation is HIM.", "NTA. This is entirely on your brother for not informing you beforehand.  You checked,  he said nothing, it's his fault.", "100% NTA.\n\nShe showed up last minute. If you do that and have dietary requirements, you bring your own food. Your brother is AH for expecting you to cater for someone you didn't know was coming.", "NTA but your brother is. Did the girlfriend know she wasn't an invited guest? Did he tell *her* that the host didn't know she'd be there? I would be so embarrassed if I were her.", "NTA. If you\u2019re a vegan you can bring your own bullshit tasteless food. Plus, she was an unplanned guest.", "NAH he should have asked if he could bring someone and said she wasVegan. he is thah not you", "GF is whining and brother needs to look like he\u2019s on her side.

If you invite 10 people, and you know nobody is vegan, you don't cook an extra vegan meal just in case.", "NTA  \nBut your brother is.  \nYour brother brought someone with unusual dietary needs and didn't tell you beforehand either that he was bringing another person, or that she was vegan.  \n\n\nYou hadn't prepared for it, and that's not your fault.  \nIf he'd told you in advance, you might have incorporated more vegan food into your plans from the start, and this wouldn't have been an issue.  \nAs is, there are limits to how far a host needs (or should) go in accommodating an unexpected guest. Ordering extra food is outside that for sure. As is cooking additional dishes in an already-busy kitchen.  \n\n\nI feel a bit sorry for his girlfriend though. I used to be vegan, and the #1 thing I least liked about it was always being the awkward/difficult one who required special treatment.  \nI'm imagining she raised it with your brother beforehand and he assured her there was bound to be something she could eat, then he didn't check in with you, and she's left eating a plate of stuffed peppers and nothing else.  \nPure speculation, but I bet she expressed frustration with him afterwards, and that's why he's taking it out on you, putting the blame on you for not ordering her something as host.", "NTA 1) you didn\u2019t know she was coming who she is or that she is vegan. 2) it\u2019s outrageous of your brother to ask you to buy her food. He brought her uninvited/unannounced he can buy her food.", "NTA, the amount of entitlement and narcissism exercised by vegans like this is palpable. Even if you were given advanced notice of this special diet, it isn't your responsibility to accommodate their mental illness. Let them keep eating their overpriced, hyper-processed dogshit, but on their own tab. Fuck special diets.", "NTA.  The only AH here is your brother.  His girlfriend is maaaaaybe a tiny bit of one, but I'm going to err on her side and say she's not and put it all on your brother.\n\n1. You asked about dietary restrictions, and nobody spoke up about being vegan.  You were under no obligation to have vegan dishes.\n\n2. You invited a handful of people, and your brother last-minute brought his girlfriend without clearing it with you first.  What an asshole.\n\n3. When you're a vegetarian on any tier (vegan, pescatarian, ovolacto, etc.), or have any other dietary restrictions, you bring a dish for yourself whenever you're invited to a dinner and/or find out the menu from the host ahead of time.  It was presumptuous for them to assume you'd have vegan options when you're not a vegan and neither was anyone else *invited*, especially for *Thanksgiving*, the holiday most current-day Americana base around eating *meat*.  I mean, jesus christ.\n\n4. If your brother was concerned about her being able to eat, why couldn't HE order her something?\n\n5. This happened to me once at my husband's friend's scaled-down friendsgiving, but (a) I was invited and (b) it was pot luck.  It was just bad luck that what I brought was one of two things (including salad) I could eat.  Wasn't the host's, other guests', or even my fault.  In your case, fault is 100% on your brother.  (I assume he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about it at all beforehand.)", "NTA you are not your brothers 'flavour of the week' chef.  You didn't know she was coming.  He needed to solve it.   If she felt like a rat cause you said she could help herself to your fridge, then she should think more positively in life.  She could have seen how accommodating you were with allowing her there but noooo you stopped the world from revolving around her!!", "NTA\n\nYou called everyone else in advance, so your brother should have said, he needed vegan food options, if he wanted you to have them...", "NTA\n\nYour brother is an idiot.", "NTA. He didn't tell you he'd bring his vegan gf. So he was well aware that no vegan food would be around. Either he didn't tell her and didn't want to order food for her or she didn't want to bring her own food. Either way it's on him/them and not your fault.", "Re-reading it, she didn't get mad with OP, she checked in about what was and wasn't vegan.  \nI read it that she's upset to find she's been brought to an event that doesn't cater to vegans. Probably after her boyfriend has assured her it'll be fine..   \nI doubt she blames OP at all, and having gotten annoyed at her BF, he's trying to pin the blame on his sister for being unaccommodating instead.", "I'm guessing he was originally planning to come alone, and the decision to bring her was a last-minute same-day thing. Either he didn't think of her dietary needs when inviting her, or she asked if there'd be vegan options and he just said \"I'm sure there'll be something\"  \n\n\nNo surprise, there wasn't much.  \n\n\nOf course, literally being a last-minute decision, they didn't have anything prepared to bring for her to eat.  \n\n\nHe should have called ahead.  \nHe should have ordered her some extra food, or they should have brought some supplies from home to make something in OPs kitchen.", "The brother didn\u2019t even warn her that he would be bringing his girlfriend.", "> stuffed peppers are lovely and a meal in themself.\n\ni love stuffed peppers but we always make them with ground beef or ground turkey.  I'ma need to know what they are stuffing their peppers with here", "Butter, dressings, cheese (these are some things that usually get added to food that otherwise would be considered vegan). It's easier for food to be vegetarian, the vegan diet has more limitations thus the chances of food being vegan friendly are lower.", "Yeah exactly, only a vegan is gonna know what the best vegan food even is anyway", "I agree, but to clarify, veganism isn't atypical at this point, and often it's not a food preference, but a dietary restriction.", "My question was sarcastic.", "You dont have to put cheese and butter into everything, jesus.", "I mean it's definitely not a requirement but they do add taste to the dish, so some people might prefer adding them to their food. Not to mention that certain dishes are more popular for get-togethers. Even the stuffed peppers could have been non vegan if that one friend preferred making them with cheese.", "And why didn't brother order GF food since he's the one who dropped the ball on all communications.", "The girlfriend was disappointed because she realized brother had sprung her on OP without warning,NAT", "Those are the ones labeled specifically as Kosher for Passover, since corn is something that most american jewry won't consume then even if it's not strictly prohibited, so specifically easy to get late winter/early spring.", "Or not brought his girlfriend to something she wasn't invited to without clearing it with the host.", "Allergic to Onions? That's a new one for me.  \n\n\nMy wife is allergic to apple and capsicum.. The two most common \"cheap and easy flavour\" ingredients in just about any commercial food-product.  \nI'm betting onion is just as awkward!"]}
