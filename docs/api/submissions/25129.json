(My apartment is quite small so that was enough to be cramped lol). I called everybody before hand to make sure whatever I was cooking would adhere to dietary restrictions & allergies etc. A few people asked if they were welcome to bring other foods, wine, drinks etc and I said sure.\n\nSo it happened last night and I had basically cooked a scaled down thanksgiving meal, smallish turkey, chicken, potatoes, mac and cheese and salad. I was also expecting other people to bring stuff and almost everyone did, it turned into kind of a potluck situation. \n\nMy brother ended up coming a bit late which isn\u2019t too unusual, but he had a woman who he introduced as his girlfriend in tow. I didn\u2019t really have a problem with it. I was thinking it would\u2019ve been nice for him to tell me she was coming but from the way he explained it it was a last minute decision. \n\nWe\u2019re all standing around my tiny table praying & when we\u2019re done it\u2019s time for food. My brothers girlfriend asked what was vegan at the table and said she\u2019d been eyeing a few things. I said I personally hadn\u2019t cooked anything vegan, but one of my friends who is vegetarian had. It was some kind of stuffed peppers thing. \n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting to have a vegan so I wasn\u2019t prepared but his girlfriend seemed really upset. My brother pulled me aside about an hour after and said it wasn\u2019t really good hosting to only have 1 dish for her to eat. To be fair, she did look sort of left out just eating stuffed peppers and i did feel bad, but when my brother suggested I order her some food to make up for it I said no. \n\nVegan food is quite expensive where I live and I had already gone over my budget for the month with my dinner. I told him he was definitely welcome to order it, but I personally couldn\u2019t afford another $25-$30 on one meal for her. \n\nThere was no big scene or anything, he stayed until the end of the night and she stayed too, i told her she was welcome to raid the fridge because i was sure I had some foods suited to her but she didn\u2019t take me up on that offer. \n\nThis morning however, he called and said that I should\u2019ve at least ordered for her, considering I only had one dish she could eat, and that it was insulting to her being told she could go through the fridge \u201clike some rat or something.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m conflicted, last night I didn\u2019t feel that bad for not ordering but today I do based on what he said and how she felt. AITA?\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not too familiar with Reddit, so feel free to lmk if I haven\u2019t been clear or formatted this wrong. TIA.\n\n\n\nSo this part on is an edit:\n\nI read through most of the comments so far and I\u2019d like to clarify that his girlfriend didn\u2019t say anything mean or demanding to me, and I\u2019m fairly sure she never intended for me to hear the rat thing. She seemed like a sweet girl, just I guess she felt out of place. I appreciate the people giving fair comments but some of you are just being mean to her, which i ask you kindly not to do when giving your opinion.

You don't crash a party, then get mad because nothing is to your liking.   That's not how this works.   If he had given you notice, then you could have prepared a few dishes, but for her to be a literal stranger then get mad because you didn't cook food to her tastes is ridiculous on her part and your brother's.", "NTA. He's the asshole for bringing someone without you knowing and for expecting you to be a mind reader and plan for vegan!", "NTA you can't cook food for people you don't even know exist. Your brother is entitled amd rude. Why didn't he order her food?", "NTA. Why didn't your brother just order her some vegan food since it was his last minute invitee? He's blaming the wrong person..", "NTA.  Your brother should have RSVP\u2019ed for her and he could have ordered her a meal himself", "NTA - beggars (and the uninvited) can't be choosers.  Bro should have sprung for his GF's dinner, the cheapskate.", "NTA. You asked everyone before party about preferences/allergies and prepared food for invited people. Your brother invited his woman without telling you  and he is responsible for her special meal.", "NTA - You asked around to make sure everyone will be accommodated AND everyone had the option to just bring something. It's your brother's fault for not talking to you and his girlfriend. Else you could have prepared something and she could have prepared something herself. No reason to blame you", "NTA. Why didn't bro order her something if he was so concerned? Of COURSE you didn't have vegan food. Most people don't unless there are vegans KNOWN TO BE ATTENDING IN ADVANCE. Bro sprang his vegan gf on you... that's on him to provide her meals. Or on her since she is a grown adult with a chosen dietary restriction.", "NTA. You had no idea she was coming and called around before. If your brother thought this was such a big issue, he would\u2019ve told you when you asked", "NTA\n\nHe showed up with a new GF party crasher. You had no idea of she was coming or her dietary habits\n\nHe's an AH for making a stink", "NTA.  As someone with dietary restrictions, I never show up to an event with food without making sure I can eat.  Whether that\u2019s calling the host to ask if they can accommodate well in advance, or expecting to primarily eat the food I brought at a pot luck, or bringing my own food when people won\u2019t accommodate me but I have to be there (or I couldn\u2019t call ahead), I make sure I have a solid plan for how I\u2019m going to eat.\n\nYour brother\u2019s girlfriend did none of those things.  As coming was a last minute decision, she should\u2019ve at least grabbed herself a heavy snack or light meal and just tucked it in her purse in case she needed it.\n\nIt\u2019s her responsibility to communicate her needs.  You had no idea you were having a vegan guest, so you prepared no vegan food.", "NTA...it would take supernatural powers to guess the needs of an uninvited guest.", "NTA\n\nShe was an unexpected guest, so you didn't have any food prepared specifically for her, and since she did show up unannounced, it was totally on her to make sure she had something to eat. \n\nYou were definitely a good host because it seems like you did your best to prepare a meal that all of the expected guests could enjoy, and that's all you had to do.", "NTA AT ALL! This topic has been brought up again and again, and it's almost always the fault of the judgmental, entitled random vegan GF who just shows up unexpectedly and insists everyone kowtow to her. \n\nYour brother didn't even tell you about her in advance, so how were you supposed to read his mind and realize he was bringing some rando GF with him? \n\nWhy are you even asking this question???", "NTA.  Your brother sounds like TA here.  He should have let you know in advance that she was coming and that she was vegan so that you could plan the meal accordingly; it reads to me like she thought he had, tbh.  It was incredibly rude of him not to do that, to you and to his date (poor girl).  And now he's blaming you instead of taking responsibility for his screw-up; don't fall for it.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't required to make anything you don't want to make. Him bullshitting you as if you're somehow required to make every type of meal there is in order to be a good host is laughable.  \n\nI guess next time I have people over I had better make 4 different pizzas.... One non vegan with red sauce, one non vegan with white sauce, one vegan with red sauce, and one vegan with white sauce.", "Nta\n\nAs a plus one, get bf (your brother)  should have let you know ahead of time that she had a dietary restriction.

Guest had dietary restrictions you were not aware of, if it was important for YOUR BROTHER\u2019S guest to have something to eat, then, he should have ordered it.  Next time she is YOUR guest, I\u2019m sure you will accommodate.", "NTA. She was an unexpected guest and your brother should've gotten her a vegan meal. I've hosted plenty of parties at my house to know you're not going to cook or order everything that everyone likes. The fact he's making you feel shitty is terrible", "NTA. You planned a party and asked for input. Her lack of food is on your brother and his lack of communication. And since it was his fault, he should have had something delivered. The GF also needs to be aware that someone with major restrictions might not be accommodated at the last minute and maybe she should bring a vegan snack bar.", "You didn't even know that your brother's girlfriend existed, or that she was coming, much less that she was vegan. Her lack of food options at your party is entirely on her and your brother. NTA", "NTA\n\nIs there some sort of expectation to cook a vegan dish just in case a vegan turns up?", "NTA. Your brother is though for bringing her and not warning you she was Vegan and then guilting you. Why didn\u2019t he order her something?", "Your brother can fuck off. NTA. He not only brough an uninvited/unexpected guest, but he also then demanded that you bend over backwards to accommodate her dietary preferences. HE could have ordered her food for delivery. SHE could have ordered food for delivery. They could have brought their own food like others. They could have no shown up unannounced.", "NTA. Your brother didn't even ask if he could bring his girlfriend, let alone tell you that she was vegan. You probably should have checked the fridge and made a definite offer of whatever you had, but if that wasn't ok, HE should have ordered her food seeing as he sprung her on you.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to provide for an uninvited guest who you didn't know would be there until after the food was cooked.", "NTA. You didn't know that your brother's gf had a dietary restriction because you weren't told, and made an effort to ask about deitary restrictions, so you did the best you could under the circumstances. On the other hand, I don't think it's jerkish behavour on her part to not eat what you put out due to her ethical convictions. Your brother however is a mildly stinky poophole, since he didn't as far as I can see, offer to contribute to her diet, or at least give a bit of advance notice when bringing a quest on short notice (why couldn't he have brought vegan food), yet was the one that made the suggestion of paying more for vegan food.", "NTA - as a vegan myself I advise hosts ahead of time and that I'm happy to sort myself out if they can't accommodate as it's awkward to avoid things required to keep them separate. She could have done the same.", "NTA- he is though, he should have asked before coming and brought a vegan dish with him - it was a potluck. You\u2019d have to be psychic to know he was bringing her.", "NTA- you weren't warned that you would be hosting a vegan. Your brother should have told you AND brought a dish to share that his gf could enjoy.", "NTA but your brother was. For bringing a guest you didn't know about, and not warning you of any dietary restrictions.", "NTA. Why didn't he order the food? He has a vegan gf that he brought without letting you know this in advance. He is more AH here, not you.", "NTA. Your brother brought an uninvited guest and then has the audacity to think YOU should PAY additional money to feed a complete stranger you just met?!!! If he was so concerned about her comfort level it was his responsibility to do something about it. Why didn\u2019t HE order her food? Your brother is entitled AF, and the only RUDE person in this situation is HIM.", "NTA. This is entirely on your brother for not informing you beforehand.  You checked,  he said nothing, it's his fault.", "100% NTA.\n\nShe showed up last minute. If you do that and have dietary requirements, you bring your own food. Your brother is AH for expecting you to cater for someone you didn't know was coming.", "NTA but your brother is. Did the girlfriend know she wasn't an invited guest? Did he tell *her* that the host didn't know she'd be there? I would be so embarrassed if I were her.", "NTA. If you\u2019re a vegan you can bring your own bullshit tasteless food. Plus, she was an unplanned guest.", "NAH he should have asked if he could bring someone and said she wasVegan. he is thah not you", "GF is whining and brother needs to look like he\u2019s on her side.
