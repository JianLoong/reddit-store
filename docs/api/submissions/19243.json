They were minimizing the energy that goes into bringing a new human into the world. That's incredibly rude. Maybe you should ask them to explain it to you - how is this a joke?", "NTA good on you for standing up to them and calling them out on their misogyny", "NTA for addressing it with them, it's not ok for them to be making your wife uncomfortable. Parental leave is not a holiday, it's time for physically and mentally recovering from childbirth, bonding with your child, and figuring out how to cope with life with a tiny human who is completely dependent on you. \n\nI look forward to the comments from people in the US about 76 weeks parental leave.", "NTA. Once or twice might have been a joke, but not non stop. It stopped being a joke when it made your wife uncomfortable. (Not to mention jokes are by definition funny).\n\nDon't these 4 grown men have their own wives and girl friends they can take advantage of? I guess not, because any country with 76 weeks of maternal leave must have women smart enough to tell them to shove off.", "NTA. They pushed it until your wife was so uncomfortable you felt you had to say something. Good job for standing up for your wife and your brothers and dad need to stop harassing a pregnant woman about doing their chores- they obviously took the \"joke\" too far. They deserved to be talked to about it if they couldn't figure it out on their own that it was getting old.", "NTA. Ye Olde 'I was just kidding!' excuse. Such a classic I'm surprised it's not a show at Medieval Times.", "NTA - The old adage that there's a grain of truth in every \"joke\" is applicable here. They weren't joking. They were building a foundation so when she starts her leave they can start asking for things. Good for you for setting clear boundaries!", "NTA\n\nOnce or twice is a joke. After that and no one else ever laughs, you're just being an ass. Great job letting your wife handle it until she couldn't anymore and asked for you to be involved. That's the way to do it. And congrats on the kid. Wishing you both the best", "NTA.  The comments annoyed your wife and you, and you fixed it.  They may have been half joking, but the repetition implies they were trying to put this idea in her head and then call on her for favors later.  It's good that you put a stop to it.", "NTA\u2026it\u2019s absurd to even ask that in a jokingly manner\u2026.Why would you want your brothers wife to come wash your shit stain underwear \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  She's freaking pregnant.   Good of you to put this to rest quickly.  Even if it was a joke, it can cause unnecessary stress for the mom-to-be.", "NTA nice job standing up for your wife.", "NTA-You handled it wonderfully.", "NTA, they just don't want to own up to their part.   You need to set some boundaries with them man regarding your wife.   Why are they even having the conversation, it's disrespectful  to both you and her.", "NTA. Their jokes were inappropriate and making your wife uncomfortable, and they needed to be told to stop and that this was in no way happening so they didn\u2019t end up bothering your wife after she gave birth and would be caring for a newborn.", "The first couple of comments would be joking. To the point they made your wife uncomfortable, they totally expected her to do their shit. NTA.  \n\nKeep that shit locked down because they are going to try again after the baby is born.", "It wasn\u2019t a joke. If you hadn\u2019t said anything, they would have been harassing her all the way to the delivery room. NTA", "NTA.  Maybe a comment ONCE is kidding, but more than that is rude  and childish.\n\nI'd probably  say, sure BIL,  I  can get your groceries  Thurs.   So, you will be at my house Wednesday  night to feed baby every 2 hours so I can sleep??", "NTA - Would they have said this if it were a man? Disgusting.", "NTA. That bs needed shutting down fast.", "NTA. They were being super annoying and you stood up to them.

Why would Americans say anything?", "Just for context, my wife is taking both maternity leave and parental leave.\n\nMaternity leave is 15 weeks that the mother gets immediately after birth. Even in cases of adoption or surrogacy, the woman who gives birth gets those 15 weeks.\n\nParental leave comes afterwards and it's either something like 35 weeks (don't know the exact number) or 61 weeks depending what option you choose. Those 35 or 61 weeks can be taken completely by one parent or be shared between both parents.\n\nSo she's getting both but I just call it parental leave because that's what everyone here uses.", "Because us Americans get exactly 0 parental leave", "We get 12 weeks of maternity leave \u2014 but employers are not mandated to py you during this time. They just can\u2019t fire you. I get 6 weeks of paid leave and the other 6 is either unpaid or you have to use PTO/ short term disability.\nPaternal leave is a new thing, my husband got 4 weeks and that\u2019s pretty much unheard of. Some tech companies like Intel have better policies, i think my SIL got 6 months off total and her husband got 3 months of bonding leave.", "Seriously? Wow, I didn't know that.", "So what happens if a woman has a c-section, or can't afford to be off unpaid? The idea of not having leave seems insane to me. Daycares here would never accept a baby so young unless the circumstances were extreme. I guess I just took for granted that parental leave is a thing everywhere.", "Also only certain employers have to allow the 12 weeks\u2014 they need to make minimum employee numbers, and you need to have worked there full time for a certain amount of time.", "The idea of 76 weeks and an employer being completely okay with that broke my brain.\n\nI bet having a baby doesn't cost 50k either? Like only 10k and insurance covers some of it? /s", "Anything past 12 weeks, your employer can fire you if they choose to. Particularly with smaller companies, paid leave is a benefit and not a right mandated by the federal government, unfortunately. I have a co-worker who put her baby in daycare at 6 weeks. It was so sad but she could not afford to stop working. Family was not available to help.", "Our healthcare system doesn't charge anything. Obviously some of our taxes go towards it but we don't get a bill or have to pay anything specifically for the birth. I couldn't imagine having to pay that much, we could never afford it.", "I am jealous because the good old USA has people go bankrupt or die if they get sick.\n\nI bet you don't have to pay thousands of dollars a month for daycare either.", "My brother and exSIL ended up in so much debt after they had my nephew because he was a complicated birth that they joked someone might try to repo the baby.", "The fees are capped by the province. I think the maximum is around $185 a month. I have it on paperwork somewhere but I don't remember the exact number."]}
