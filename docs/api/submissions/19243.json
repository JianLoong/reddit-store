Some situations require firm boundaries and clear consequences for violations, but any/all situations where inappropriate comments are being said about your wife do need to be called out immediately.", "Even if she *was* on vacation (which, to be clear, parental leave is most certainly *not*), what\u2019s the \u201cjoke\u201d here?   \u201cDer, hur, hur. isn\u2019t it be funny to try and demean this woman by treating her like she\u2019s property that men are entitled to own, pass around, and force into servitude?\u201d\n\nYeah, NTA.  But you got to keep these misogynistic assholes away from your wife and kids (and ideally yourself, too).  Being around that kind of shitty energy and mindset, especially when it\u2019s so insidiously casual like this, doesn\u2019t provide any benefit to your wife and kids, only harm, and the sexist assholes are certainly not entitled to access/opportunities to spew it onto them.\n\nPut it another way, let\u2019s say you were looking to buy a house.  The agent locates a house in the neighborhood you grew up in, so you\u2019ve been around it a long time and the location and the exterior all feel really familiar.  And parts of the interior aren\u2019t all bad, but upon closer examination you discover there\u2019s this giant, gaping hellmouth in the basement that\u2019s spewing out evil and raw sewage.  \n\nSo are you really going to want your family anywhere *near* that house, much less spend a lot of time with it?  Just because the house feels familiar to you (like a family member)?  Or because it seems like you\u2019re supposed to rationalize it with sentiments like \u201cit\u2019s not *all* bad, just the gaping hellmouth part, so it\u2019s okay to expose them to it and expect them to just ignore the massive hellmouth basement part\u201d (which is like asking the family to be around these guys because they\u2019ve family, and \u201cnot all bad,\u201d and expect them to just put up with/try to ignore the demeaning sexism stuff).  \n\nMaybe not the perfect analogy, but hopefully you get my point.", "NTA but maybe you can also start naming chores those 4 grown ass men can do to make your wife's recovery easier.", "76 weeks to bond with her baby\u2026 That sounds amazing!!! I barely got 76 days\u2026 within a month of my third I was badgered to start working again. \nBut to the question NTA the men in your family sound awful, babies are a lot of work and need lots of love. It\u2019s not a vacation. She\u2019s going to be very busy.\nEnjoy your new family member!! Congratulations", "Good for you for standing up for your wife. You're not like those assholes. They can do their own laundry. They think that being pregnant and taking care of a newborn is a vacation?!! They're so lazy and selfish. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you have your wife\u2019s back. Make sure it stays a joke and they don\u2019t try to get her to clean.\n\nIf anything, your wife needs the extra help as she recovers. My dad came over for a week to help with chores after I gave birth.", "They won\u2019t be able to explain why it\u2019s funny, because the premise is that they think all men are resentful that women get what they see as a \u201cvacation\u201d with maternity leave. Which I can basically guarantee means none of them actually lifted a finger to genuinely contribute to infant care, and/or they\u2019re resentful of women generally and have subscribed to counter-feminist ideology in which they believe women have more privilege.\n\nIn order to expect anyone thinks this is funny, that\u2019s the mindset they think everyone else is operating with. That\u2019s the premise. \n\nOtherwise there is no \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\nAlso, even if it is a misguided joke, you make it once. Not so incessantly that you wear down someone\u2019s resolve. This tells me that not only do they have this mindset, they are ACTIVELY resentful and think about this constantly, feeling hard-done-by. Good God. Imagine seeing a heavily pregnant woman living her life and thinking \u201cnow there\u2019s a lazy privileged woman getting a free ride.\u201d What? How out of touch are you, dude? Just glad OP escaped this toxic masculine mess (if OP is male, which they don\u2019t specify).", "Exactly if it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d some laundry/errands why don\u2019t think so it themselves", "Generally, with this amount of maternity leave it's not the employer that pays you, it's the govt.

They were not joking until you called them out over it", "NTA and GOOD for you for standing up for your pregnant wife against your AH father and brothers. Nice to see a supportive husband in these situations once in a while as you are a rarity on reddit", "Spoiler alert - they weren't 'joking'. They were putting it out there in the hope that it would stick and they'd get unpaid maid service.\n\nNow you've shot them down in flames they're claiming it was a 'joke' because they know they've failed and are back-pedalling to try not to look stupid. Sorry - not to look any more stupid.\n\nYou and your wife, on the other hand : NTA\n\n*By the way - where are you that Mrs OP can get 76 weeks parental leave? I'm in the UK and the max is 'only' 52!*", "NTA. Your wife is taking time off to take care of 1 baby. Not 3.", "NTA - men like these assume women 's primary goal is to serve men and it doesn't occur to them that your wife is a human being, equal to them.  Not respecting women is something they have a history of.  I bet they all would vote Trump!\n\nWhen called out on this BS they always say 'I was only joking' or 'You can't take a joke' .  If they pinched her bottom, that's what they would say -' We were only having fun'\n\nWhat you should do is invite them to your home to help out with the child.  Invite them to the house and then SHE leaves for an hour to run errands.  Let them deal with the child, change nappies etc.\n\nOR She should pinch their bottoms and then say 'I was only Joking'", "Dad jokes are not funny but are still considered jokes same thing with most puns", "To add to your point, even if OP's wife was indeed taking a long holiday she shouldn't be asked / expected to do the grown men's chores.\n\nOP, you've learnt your lesson now, you now know to shut these shit down as soon as your family brings up these misogynistic comments", "Canada.
