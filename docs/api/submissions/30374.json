It's not a big deal if he goes or not but I got upset because he didn't even let me know that he was going. He could tell something was wrong with me because I was being quiet and asked what was wrong. I told him it didn't really matter and I'd get over it and didn't want to argue but he kept pushing the issue over and over. Finally I told him that I wish he would have told me beforehand if he made plans for us to go somewhere that I would like to know ahead of time. He said he intentionally didn't tell me because he thought I'd get mad about him making plans and knew I probably wouldn't want to go so wasn't going to tell me. So now my feelings are obviously hurt because he intentionally lied to me over something stupid. He told me I need to know too much and shouldn't worry about it and that he doesn't want me to go and I should just stay home. I told him i was upset that he intentionally hids stuff from me and that isnt healthy for a marriage and I asked him if he was just going to load up the kids in the morning and just leave and not tell me anything? He didn't have an answer and just turned it all back on me for needing to know everything.

What is the state of your marriage otherwise? I don\u2019t think YTA for being bothered by him making plans without you but possibly for how you handled it.

They are looking for a person with less life experience so they can manipulate them easier. \n\nIt worked for you? Dandy!

What was his reason other than you might get mad? Why would you get mad if you wanted to take the kids and you to church? That\u2019s a lame excuse. Obviously you don\u2019t have communication between the two of you. How hard would it have been for him to say to you hey my parents want me and the kids to go to church tomorrow would you like to come with us? But No he just lies to you.\n\nThis is a big red flag that he\u2019s going to exclude you from things. There\u2019s something more going on here. Is he meeting someone else at church? How often does he leave you alone and go with other people.\n\nQuite frankly if he\u2019s going to be like that I would just say fine you got the kids for the day I\u2019m going out and spending the time alone or with friends and not come home till late at night.", "This is called blaming the victim sir.", "But there\u2019s no victim in there?\nThey had a fight (I\u2019m trying to understand the context of that fight as it might tip the balance one way or the other) \n\nHusband made plans with the kids without telling the wife (bad). \n\nWife gets rightfully upset but doesn\u2019t tell husband (bad) \n\nHusband sees wife is upset and insist for her to open up (good) \n\nShe does and explains why she got upset (good). \n\nHe gave some weird/non-answer and from what op said, it\u2019s tied to the fight. This would literally tip the whole conversation and argument.\n\nWhat is she a victim of ?\nThey have bad communication. Her for refusing to explain what was wrong until husband insisted, and him for excluding her in the plan. It\u2019s all looking harmless especially as op said they don\u2019t usually fight.", "\"Why did you get mad at him when he tried finding out why you were mad?\" Is what you basically asked.\n\nI hate when people expect their partners to be mind readers, but this guy is a special kind of stupid to think this would be ok in any way. And then, when she did say why, he flipped it on her for \"needing to know too much\" and wanted her to be quiet and obedient and let him do what he wanted whether he was lying or not.\n\nHer only problem is she was going to just accept it but he pushed the answer out of her, then blamed her for her response, like what you're insinuating. And that, sir, is called blaming the victim.", "He is clearly stupid. But there\u2019s a fight mentioned that happened before that phone call. Knowing what happened there would give so much context. \n\n-> let\u2019s say she did something pretty horrible and broke his trust, and so he just wants time with the kids away from her, he\u2019d still be an AH for doing it like that, but maybe he just can\u2019t deal with her and wants to get the kids out of the house for a bit. \n\n-> let\u2019s say the fight was about her discovering he did something shady and she confronted him about it and he badly reacted : her not explaining why she was upset would make sense and she\u2019d be blameless in the whole thing. \n\n\nShe controls the whole story. She told us they used to fight but not anymore (and we don\u2019t know what about) and now we know they had an argument, and even though they did, the husband wanted to see why she was upset afterwards. \n\nIt feels like we have missing info. If you want don\u2019t need or want context to pass judgment that\u2019s fine. But I do. The person is asking for judgment, I\u2019ll do it when I have all the pieces of the puzzle."]}
