Like South Asian Indian. Dads side was definitely Scottish, Mom I dunno but she had blonde hair and blue eyes. I don't know that she ever stopped deluding herself into thinking she was Indian Royalty\u2122, I just haven't seen her since school.\n\nI lived with a dude who wanted to be a hacker so hard that he would make up the wildest stories. Yes, sure the FBI hired you at 18 to do clandestine installs of carnivore devices at major ISPs. Never saw him so much as open a command prompt. Could not participate in conversation with those of us who did programming and what not as a hobby.\n\nThese aren't just \"lying to seem interesting\" or \"lying to make friends\" examples, they have made these things such a core part of their own self perception that they're completely deluded.\n\nOPs GF reminds me of \"Mr. Furious\" from \"Mystery Men\". Totally convinced she has a super power and it's just a fucking inconvenience and ruins shit pretty much every time the \"power\" is used.", "To be fair, OP never said whether she was using them or not. She just might be very bad at that.", "I take pride in my ability to navigate to obscure towns off the top of my head. But I only ever do it as a party gag. Because when I actually have done trips without proper directions, it\u2019s added good time to the trip. I could tell you how to get from Benson, NC to Galesburg, IL without looking at a map but if I\u2019m going on a trip from my hometown to Nashville (which is like three roads) I\u2019m still taking the gps because I don\u2019t know what alternate routes I may need for live traffic. For how many times she\u2019s gotten lost there\u2019s no reason for her to be doing it on her own", "I agree NTA,\n\nBut you know that's how we did it before GPS. We'd write down the roads and look for them.\n\nOnce, driving from Chicago to Indy, there was a major backup on 94.  \n\nI found an exit that put me on some highway south, and figured if I kept going south, I'd eventually hit Hwy 30, which I knew stretched from at least Fort Wayne to Joliet.\n\nFound 30, went East to Merrilville, and hopped on 65. \n\nI use GPS now when I need to be somewhere on time. But I don't need it all the time. \n\nI sometimes miss getting lost.", "You do realize that this used to be normal before we had smartphones, right? I could navigate from Denver to Montrose and all of the towns in between in my head.", "Yeah if OPs cool with it more power to him but this would be my personal hell. I definitely get people wanting to take a more scenic or sight seeing approach to travel. But getting lost for the sake of it just sucks imo", "I think it can be fun, as long as it's done in the appropriate context and with everyone in the car consenting. But I like puzzles and discovering new places, and for me, the point of a trip is to spend time with the people I'm with.\n\nFor context, I learned to drive before GPS was a thing. I sometimes miss navigating in my head, so sometimes I will do it intentionally. It's sad how much my navigation skills have atrophied since I've learned to rely on GPS. Getting lost was how I found my favorite dive bar ever. \n\nIf OP really hates it, then he can ask her to do it on her own or with a friend. Or maybe he's not a match for her. Idk. I think it's wroth a try though.", "Then it's not for you, but it might help this couple.", "Off topic, but I lol-ed at Galesburg, IL!  You either have friends/family in the area, or you have an association with Knox.\n\nGalesburg is easily reachable by major interstates, but failing the aforementioned reasons (and possibly a few local, gem restaurants), I can't imagine it being a purposeful destination! Don't get me wrong,  it's an amazing little town with interesting history (visit some of the historic buildings on the Knox campus if you're ever in the area, and check out Landmark or Pizza House for eats!), it just not a town I ever expected to see referenced on Reddit.", "NTA. That would drive me crazy.", "\"said I was demeaning her abilities\" \n\nSorry but what abilities? The ability to get you lost??", "The only good \"inbuilt GPS skills\" out there are people like my father, a soon to be retiring trucker, who knows all the roads (and I mean all of them), as well as a few other seasoned truckers I know around my age.  He doesn't use GPS as they take the main, busier roads if another route is more effective, i.e. less traffic, knows about ongoing road work, you name it. Your girlfriend doesn't have that, clearly.  Furthermore, her blunders are wasting time.  Before you know it, you barely get any time at your destination:  Parks usually open at sunrise and close at sunset.  Stores or establishments close.  Movies are missed at the theatre.  Beaches close when the lifeguard is off duty.  That \"puzzle\" your gf wants to play just ruined your plans.\n\nNTA\n\nINFO:  Does she read maps?  It's old school, but pre-GPS that's what everyone did.", "My response to her saying \n\n> I was demeaning her abilities.\n\nWould have been \"what abilities? Every time you navigate, we get lost. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.\" \nNTA here.", ">\"inbuilt GPS\" skills\n\nDoes she use a paper map, or is she just winging it?  If she is winging it YTA for letting her keep doing that.", "NTA", "NTA, nobody has \u201cinbuilt GPS skills\u201d and this sounds like every single cartoon ever. \n\nThe only way people can find a destination without some sort of GPS app is if they\u2019ve been there before, usually several times.", "Guessing randomly and navigating with a map are two different things", "I'd be cool with this as long as I/we could stop at antique stores along the way.  And whenever I/we get hungry.", "This.  I've found so many interesting things on printed maps that just don't show up on the GPS;  if I'm on a road trip, I'll definitely try to at least take a look at the printed maps to see what I might otherwise be missing.\n\nBut, yeah, if I'm trying to get to a job interview/party/whatever, I'll of course depend on the GPS.\n\nPhew, that girlfriend sounds like a PITA.", "I agree NTA. OP if she thinks it\u2019s fun how about this- you use your phone to navigate (put on silent and angled so you can see it) and she can use her phone to navigate. Then she can see if she can find the best route and match the one that google map uses", "Sounds like a usual road trip for my family. My Nana omce told me that as long as a road has double yellow lines, you won't get lost. Dad took a lot of \"long cuts\".  I turned a 2 hour drive into a 12 hour drive one.  Almost ran out of gas and saw a fabulous sunset. Definitely a good decision.", "I agree, but everybody has their thing.", "We always used maps, we had Road Atlases and AAA maps for longer journeys. I can also pop up the map on my phone and come up with alternatives if we run into issues. It isn't something you do in your head.", "I wasn't learning to drive, but learned how to read maps traveling with my parents and grandparents. Did this with my kids too, they're older and use Google maps nowadays, as do I.", "I\u2019ve actually never been to Galesburg nor do I have any connections. I just know it\u2019s off 74 near the split with the CKC at the turn toward the quad cities. I just know roads and towns large enough to be in bold print on maps"]}
