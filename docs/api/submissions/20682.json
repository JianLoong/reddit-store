Like South Asian Indian. Dads side was definitely Scottish, Mom I dunno but she had blonde hair and blue eyes. I don't know that she ever stopped deluding herself into thinking she was Indian Royalty\u2122, I just haven't seen her since school.\n\nI lived with a dude who wanted to be a hacker so hard that he would make up the wildest stories. Yes, sure the FBI hired you at 18 to do clandestine installs of carnivore devices at major ISPs. Never saw him so much as open a command prompt. Could not participate in conversation with those of us who did programming and what not as a hobby.\n\nThese aren't just \"lying to seem interesting\" or \"lying to make friends\" examples, they have made these things such a core part of their own self perception that they're completely deluded.\n\nOPs GF reminds me of \"Mr. Furious\" from \"Mystery Men\".

She just might be very bad at that.", "I take pride in my ability to navigate to obscure towns off the top of my head. But I only ever do it as a party gag. Because when I actually have done trips without proper directions, it\u2019s added good time to the trip. I could tell you how to get from Benson, NC to Galesburg, IL without looking at a map but if I\u2019m going on a trip from my hometown to Nashville (which is like three roads) I\u2019m still taking the gps because I don\u2019t know what alternate routes I may need for live traffic.

I could navigate from Denver to Montrose and all of the towns in between in my head.", "Yeah if OPs cool with it more power to him but this would be my personal hell. I definitely get people wanting to take a more scenic or sight seeing approach to travel. But getting lost for the sake of it just sucks imo", "I think it can be fun, as long as it's done in the appropriate context and with everyone in the car consenting. But I like puzzles and discovering new places, and for me, the point of a trip is to spend time with the people I'm with.\n\nFor context, I learned to drive before GPS was a thing. I sometimes miss navigating in my head, so sometimes I will do it intentionally. It's sad how much my navigation skills have atrophied since I've learned to rely on GPS. Getting lost was how I found my favorite dive bar ever. \n\nIf OP really hates it, then he can ask her to do it on her own or with a friend. Or maybe he's not a match for her. Idk.

You either have friends/family in the area, or you have an association with Knox.\n\nGalesburg is easily reachable by major interstates, but failing the aforementioned reasons (and possibly a few local, gem restaurants), I can't imagine it being a purposeful destination! Don't get me wrong,  it's an amazing little town with interesting history (visit some of the historic buildings on the Knox campus if you're ever in the area, and check out Landmark or Pizza House for eats!), it just not a town I ever expected to see referenced on Reddit.", "NTA.

The ability to get you lost??", "The only good \"inbuilt GPS skills\" out there are people like my father, a soon to be retiring trucker, who knows all the roads (and I mean all of them), as well as a few other seasoned truckers I know around my age.  He doesn't use GPS as they take the main, busier roads if another route is more effective, i.e. less traffic, knows about ongoing road work, you name it. Your girlfriend doesn't have that, clearly.  Furthermore, her blunders are wasting time.  Before you know it, you barely get any time at your destination:  Parks usually open at sunrise and close at sunset.  Stores or establishments close.  Movies are missed at the theatre.  Beaches close when the lifeguard is off duty.  That \"puzzle\" your gf wants to play just ruined your plans.\n\nNTA\n\nINFO:  Does she read maps?

OP if she thinks it\u2019s fun how about this- you use your phone to navigate (put on silent and angled so you can see it) and she can use her phone to navigate.

My Nana omce told me that as long as a road has double yellow lines, you won't get lost. Dad took a lot of \"long cuts\".  I turned a 2 hour drive into a 12 hour drive one.

If she finds getting lost a hobby - then she can do it in her own time not on joint trips or when you have places to be at certain times.
