Trips where the journey is the point and she can navigate to solve the puzzle and you will be chill about whatever adventures she gets you into along the way\n\nShe needs to understand that trips of the second kind aren't fun for you if you have somewhere to be, and it would be nice if you would indulge her puzzle-solving hobby and make it a way for the two of you to bond.", "People in the real world are so delusional about themselves and their abilities.\n\nShe\u2019s not a magical GPS fairy.\n\nNTA.

Like South Asian Indian. Dads side was definitely Scottish, Mom I dunno but she had blonde hair and blue eyes. I don't know that she ever stopped deluding herself into thinking she was Indian Royalty\u2122, I just haven't seen her since school.\n\nI lived with a dude who wanted to be a hacker so hard that he would make up the wildest stories. Yes, sure the FBI hired you at 18 to do clandestine installs of carnivore devices at major ISPs. Never saw him so much as open a command prompt. Could not participate in conversation with those of us who did programming and what not as a hobby.\n\nThese aren't just \"lying to seem interesting\" or \"lying to make friends\" examples, they have made these things such a core part of their own self perception that they're completely deluded.\n\nOPs GF reminds me of \"Mr. Furious\" from \"Mystery Men\". Totally convinced she has a super power and it's just a fucking inconvenience and ruins shit pretty much every time the \"power\" is used.", "To be fair, OP never said whether she was using them or not. She just might be very bad at that.", "I take pride in my ability to navigate to obscure towns off the top of my head. But I only ever do it as a party gag. Because when I actually have done trips without proper directions, it\u2019s added good time to the trip. I could tell you how to get from Benson, NC to Galesburg, IL without looking at a map but if I\u2019m going on a trip from my hometown to Nashville (which is like three roads) I\u2019m still taking the gps because I don\u2019t know what alternate routes I may need for live traffic. For how many times she\u2019s gotten lost there\u2019s no reason for her to be doing it on her own", "I agree NTA,\n\nBut you know that's how we did it before GPS. We'd write down the roads and look for them.\n\nOnce, driving from Chicago to Indy, there was a major backup on 94.  \n\nI found an exit that put me on some highway south, and figured if I kept going south, I'd eventually hit Hwy 30, which I knew stretched from at least Fort Wayne to Joliet.\n\nFound 30, went East to Merrilville, and hopped on 65. \n\nI use GPS now when I need to be somewhere on time. But I don't need it all the time. \n\nI sometimes miss getting lost.", "You do realize that this used to be normal before we had smartphones, right? I could navigate from Denver to Montrose and all of the towns in between in my head.", "Yeah if OPs cool with it more power to him but this would be my personal hell. I definitely get people wanting to take a more scenic or sight seeing approach to travel. But getting lost for the sake of it just sucks imo", "I think it can be fun, as long as it's done in the appropriate context and with everyone in the car consenting. But I like puzzles and discovering new places, and for me, the point of a trip is to spend time with the people I'm with.\n\nFor context, I learned to drive before GPS was a thing. I sometimes miss navigating in my head, so sometimes I will do it intentionally. It's sad how much my navigation skills have atrophied since I've learned to rely on GPS. Getting lost was how I found my favorite dive bar ever. \n\nIf OP really hates it, then he can ask her to do it on her own or with a friend. Or maybe he's not a match for her. Idk. I think it's wroth a try though.", "Then it's not for you, but it might help this couple.", "Off topic, but I lol-ed at Galesburg, IL!  You either have friends/family in the area, or you have an association with Knox.\n\nGalesburg is easily reachable by major interstates, but failing the aforementioned reasons (and possibly a few local, gem restaurants), I can't imagine it being a purposeful destination! Don't get me wrong,  it's an amazing little town with interesting history (visit some of the historic buildings on the Knox campus if you're ever in the area, and check out Landmark or Pizza House for eats!), it just not a town I ever expected to see referenced on Reddit."]}
