They make sure to be in the reception area for the highlights.", "NTA It doesn't sound like you were flaunting the baby around nor did you have ulterior motives for making the wedding his big family debut. Plus the reception was nearly over and the visit was brief. Hell if I were your sister I would've insisted on seeing my little nephew and would've invited your husband to bring him down to the wedding for a little bit.

You stole no thunder. Congrats OP!!", "It seems like the timing here is what is most important. To have a handful of guests leave for a few minutes at the end of the night shouldn't be a big deal. Tbh, I had no idea where anyone was during my wedding reception--because people were having fun. Brides do not get to own people on the day of their weddings, and I think this bride-centered culture is starting to make weddings was less fun. From my perspective, NTA.

Put on a fake wig and said he's Addams family's It?", "Based on how you've explained it here, NTA.\n\nHowever, your sister may not know that it was your Aunt who was the instigator / that you didn't bring up the baby until asked.

When did every bride & groom turn into narcissistic assholes?!?!", "NTA. It sounds like you were respectful of your sister's wedding day by keeping your baby out of the spotlight and avoiding bringing him to the actual ceremony. It's also understandable that family members would be curious about your son and want to see him, especially if they haven't met him yet. You were kind enough to accommodate your aunt's request for a brief visit, and it's not your fault that she brought other family members along with her.\n\nYour sister's reaction seems to be more about her own insecurities and a desire for attention than anything you did wrong. It's unfair for her to blame you for taking the spotlight away from her on her wedding day, especially since you were respectful of her wishes and didn't make a big deal about your son being there. It's also unreasonable for her to expect you to keep your son a complete secret from the rest of the family.\n\nYou can try to talk to your sister and address her concerns, but ultimately it's up to her to move past this and recognize that you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.

Couldn't tell you what the gowns looked like, what the flowers were, what music was played, what I ate, etc at any of them and I wasn't too drunk to remember it.

No. Do I think it was an AH move? No. But a little thoughtless? Kinda. I can see why bride would be hurt. I don't think she's being entitled or being a bridezilla or an AH by attempting to express that to you.\n\nSo I'd say NAH but...\n\nIntentionally or not, and whether it makes sense to the average redditor or not: you hurt your sister's feelings on her wedding day.

An apology is a way of acknowledging that you caused a hurt that you didn't want to cause, or that you regret causing.\n\nAnd... I feel like that fits this situation perfectly.\n\nI could be wrong. Your sister might have been a golden child/bridezilla/somethingphobic/AH in the past and you've lost any sympathy for her, in which case... you're fine.

Especially when OP apparently didn't want anyone to see their infant due to their immune system beforehand but it was suddenly okay during a wedding reception where people have been mingling and hugging each other all night. Just sounds like an unfortunate miscommunication, but they should have really planned that better.
