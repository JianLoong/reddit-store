So I leashed him up and took him in with me.  \n\nI had planned on a quick trip, no more than ten minutes. I went to the produce department to grab some stuff.  A guy, probably in his 30's, not an employee, rudely told me that pets aren't allowed in grocery stores and asked why I had my dog with me.  Before I could respond he told me it was gross as fuck to have my dog in the produce section.   I explained it was hot out and I planned to be quick in the store.  I apologized and said the most convenient thing for me was to come here with Peanut.  He told me to fuck off and not to be a lazy pet owner. Then he stormed off. It was a bit of a scene.  Feeling uncomfortable, I just left.  I thought it'd be no big deal, Peanut didn't misbehave or have an accident, And I didn't think I was being an asshole.", "created_utc": 1676919945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117hgq6/aita_for_taking_my_dog_into_the_grocery_store_for/", "score": 839, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So I leashed him up and took him in with me.  \n\nI had planned on a quick trip, no more than ten minutes. I went to the produce department to grab some stuff.  A guy, probably in his 30's, not an employee, rudely told me that pets aren't allowed in grocery stores and asked why I had my dog with me.  Before I could respond he told me it was gross as fuck to have my dog in the produce section.   I explained it was hot out and I planned to be quick in the store.  I apologized and said the most convenient thing for me was to come here with Peanut.  He told me to fuck off and not to be a lazy pet owner. Then he stormed off. It was a bit of a scene.  Feeling uncomfortable, I just left.
