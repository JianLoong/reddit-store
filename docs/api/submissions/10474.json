So I leashed him up and took him in with me.  \n\nI had planned on a quick trip, no more than ten minutes. I went to the produce department to grab some stuff.  A guy, probably in his 30's, not an employee, rudely told me that pets aren't allowed in grocery stores and asked why I had my dog with me.  Before I could respond he told me it was gross as fuck to have my dog in the produce section.   I explained it was hot out and I planned to be quick in the store.  I apologized and said the most convenient thing for me was to come here with Peanut.  He told me to fuck off and not to be a lazy pet owner. Then he stormed off. It was a bit of a scene.  Feeling uncomfortable, I just left.  I thought it'd be no big deal, Peanut didn't misbehave or have an accident, And I didn't think I was being an asshole.", "created_utc": 1676919945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117hgq6/aita_for_taking_my_dog_into_the_grocery_store_for/", "score": 8792, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So I leashed him up and took him in with me.  \n\nI had planned on a quick trip, no more than ten minutes. I went to the produce department to grab some stuff.  A guy, probably in his 30's, not an employee, rudely told me that pets aren't allowed in grocery stores and asked why I had my dog with me.  Before I could respond he told me it was gross as fuck to have my dog in the produce section.   I explained it was hot out and I planned to be quick in the store.  I apologized and said the most convenient thing for me was to come here with Peanut.  He told me to fuck off and not to be a lazy pet owner. Then he stormed off. It was a bit of a scene.  Feeling uncomfortable, I just left.

That was only because I saw a little girl crying by herself outside the grocery store when I was leaving work, and she glomed on to my dog when I went to make sure she was alright. So I brought both in, asking if the store could page for her parents. They were located, and my girl got a treat for letting an upset kid hang on to her.", "DON'T bring your ankle biter around me! My daughter has a scar from a dachshund. Her/Our GS would've changed diapers, if she could! \n\nWhy is it always little breeds brought into restaurants, stores, etc and treated like accessories?", "I have scars on my ankles from a former client whose pack of \"chilinquents\" (a portmanteau he proudly made up for his delinquent chihuahuas) attacked me. Horrible animals.", "What! My beardie gives me great emotional support! He just cuddles right up on my chest :-)\n\nBut really, no, he doesn't go to the grocery store.", "And their safety. Ive met dogs that are sweethearts until they\u2019re around another dog", "A man just died when his leashed dog that he had *tied to his waist* didn't get off the train with him as the doors closed. He then got dragged when the train started moving and died.\n\nETA: this was in DC, somehow left that out of my comment though I intended to write it.", "Service dogs cost thousands for a reason. There's nothing more frustrating than seeing one trying to do its job while someone's \"furbaby\" is barking and lunging at it. Dogs are great but they don't want to be at the store either. Take them home", "See, I would qualify what you did as a borderline emergency situation. It was the right and responsible thing to do. \n\nWhat you did was common sense. People without common sense are why we can\u2019t have nice things.", "We have a store and we have store cats. Those shops probably keep a cat the same reason we do, to keep rats away. We tried everything we could to combat rats, but they just kept coming back no matter how we tidy the store. We got a cat and boom, no more rats. The loss of a few customers allergic to cats was definitely worth it.", "The dog was his ptsd service dog.", "This is one of the reasons we bought an EV. You can set the AC and leave it on without leaving a gas engine running while unattended (which is not a good idea for a whole bunch of reasons) and your pet will be safe, even on hot days. \n\nI would not personally leave my dog unattended for an extended period even with this option, but for a few minutes, I can dodge in, pick up milk or whatever and not have to worry."]}
