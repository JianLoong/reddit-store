My late sister in law Sarah was killed by a drunk driver 9 months ago. They had 2 kids together Millie (6F) and Ryan (9M). My husband (42M) Justin and I have been helping my brother with our niece and nephew since my SIL passed. We have 3 kids of our own and it\u2019s been nice to let the cousins hang out a bit more.\n\nNathan starting dating Brittany (26F) about 6 months ago and they are planning a wedding taking place first weekend of November. Lately Nathan has been dropping the kids off with us more and more for over night stays, including school nights, so he and Brittany can \u201cgo blow off steam.\u201d It\u2019s probably 4-5 nights a week at this point. I know people grieve differently but this feels really fast. Millie and Ryan are also having a hard time as Brittany has moved into the house with them and started removing pictures of Sarah. Nathan told her not to do this but she keeps going and pushing saying things like \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nNathan and I have always been close and Sarah was the sister I never had. I\u2019ve talked to him a few times about moving too quickly with Brittany and maybe taking a step back and let this grow. I told him if he wants to marry her now, if she\u2019s really the one that won\u2019t change with more time before a wedding happens. I\u2019ve also talked to him about Millie and Ryan needing stability and their dad consistently because they are hurting and still processing. He told me I crossed a line with bringing the kids up and he was doing the best he can. \n\nCut to yesterday. Brittany mentioned to Justin and I that Millie and Ryan would need to stay with us permanently once they have a baby so \u201cNathan doesn\u2019t show favorites.\u201d I stared at Nathan for a second and said this wasn\u2019t appropriate conversation to have when the kids were in earshot. Brittany said she didn\u2019t care and wasn\u2019t looking forward to playing step mom to the two \u201cbrats.\u201d Millie and Ryan are great kids but their world has been shattered with the loss of their mom and now Brittany having moved in and apparently marrying Nathan.\n\nI asked Nathan if we could speak privately and Brittany butted in saying anything I needed to say to him I could say to her. Against my better judgement I said \u201cFine. You\u2019re overstepping your place in this family and using my brother as a meal ticket. Those kids should come first.\u201d I thought her head was going to explode. She began yelling at me and that I was selfish for not wanting my brother to be happy. I told her it was time to grow up and realize the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. Nathan told me I was out of line and played the \u201cThat\u2019s my fiancee!\u201d card before they both stormed out, leaving the kids yet again. He has yet to check in on them\n\nAt this point I don\u2019t trust my brother\u2019s judgement and don\u2019t want to keep the kids but Justin and I feel like we don\u2019t have another choice.

I can\u2019t speak for other countries, but in the US, it\u2019s very hard to get the court to give you custody of your niblings against the wishes of a living parent.

Your brother is TA, but he has custody.  So if you anger him, he could keep the kids and they will be miserable.  Right now your brother is only thinking about his needs and not his kids.  You can\u2019t fix that.  It\u2019s something he is going to have to figure out on his own.\n\nIn the meantime, I would suggest you be really nice to them and apologize for blowing up.  Then suggest that rather than this day to day thing of dropping the kids off, why doesn\u2019t he just let the kids stay with you during the week and optionally on the weekends as he desires, until her gets settled in with his new wife.  Ask if you can have some of the pictures of the late wife or ask the kids to snatch some up to stick in their bags to bring to your house.  By doing it this way, you are getting the kids on a reliable schedule, you are making it easy for your brother to leave them with you.  Once they are regularly staying at your place, the new wife will make sure that are too busy to take the kids on the weekends.  So, now you will have the kids all the time with the permission of the dad.  Once you have them for that long, then you can go see a lawyer about filing for on the grounds of abandonment\u2026.\n\nYou can\u2019t fix your brother.  He is all about his new wife, and she has made it clear she doesn\u2019t want the kids around.  And when she said that he didn\u2019t stand up for his kids.  He is lost to his kids. So the best thing you can do for them is to let them move in with you for as much as your brother wants.  Give them the stability that they need.  He isn\u2019t going to fight to have them.  \n\nDo, make sure he signs a medical POA for the kids so that if you have to take them to the ER or doc appts, you have permission to make decisions.\n\nIf you file for custody now, you may cause him to fight you on it, rather than him just letting them go, until you have enough evidence for legal guardianship.", "NTA of course.

There have been cases where an unfit mother or father kept the children who would otherwise have been in a safe home until they realized possession of the children = free money. I am not saying that this is the case here, just something to be aware of when you evaluate your options.\n\nIf you get legal custody of the children, of course then they should get the benefit of any Social Security or other funds meant to help them, but tread carefully to make sure you can keep them safe.", "The kids do check checks that Nathan, when was in a better mind and with the help of our mom, are going into accounts set up for each kid respectively.

Who is paying for clothes, shoes, after school activities, field trips , school lunches. That doesn\u2019t include food, ( not just meals but packing school lunches or giving children lunch money) water, power, rooms, furniture and bedding for two extra children. All of these things are expensive and prices on goods and services are increasing. Aside from information about visitation, how much time children spend with you ( record every single day) start to record money that is being spent. Also how much money you are given to take care of these children.  When my children had overnight with relatives the adults the children were staying with were offered money and my children always had money just in case. How much has been given to you for taking care of these children for the past 9 months?  It was be a nice piece of information to have in case you need it.  NTA and you are wonderful people.", "Ask your brother if he\u2019ll let you (or someone else in your family) store everything that belonged to your SIL, that way you know it\u2019s safe for the kids. I wanted to put that part first because I hadn\u2019t seen anyone else say it yet. \n\nA POA is a way for you to gain more access to things like school and medical things, which will help in the immediate and will be much quicker. That will buy you some time to get a game plan together for custody. It would be best if you can get him to agree to allow you guardianship, but start talking to an attorney now and get a game plan in place. I think if you blindsided him it may work against you. Keep him on your side so you can do what\u2019s best for the kids. NTA", "NTA but you need to go about getting custody in a smarter way. You keep saying you don't want to be nosy but if you want the kids you need to be. \n\nStop being so combative with your brother and Brittany. You want them on your side. It seems that she is in charge right now and she already said she wanted you to take the kids. Play that out. Tell her you will do it as long as it's legally drawn up. If your brother is as deep as he is he will go along with it. If/when your brother comes to his senses it can maybe be reversed but this is not about him.", "Nta\n\nI think it's time to petition for guardianship, as you don't have any say in medical treatment and school at the moment, and you need those to adequately take care of the children.\n\nI'm glad you're thinking of their wellbeing.", "NTA. Your brother is horrible and found a more horrible future partner", "NTA protect those kids", "I think you\u2019d have to rely on your judgement. I wouldn\u2019t trust your brother at this point", "NTA\n\nSave as many pictures of Sarah and mementos of hers  as you can. The kids will want them later.

Start your binder.", "NTA - Can you get some of their Mom's things before new girl throws it all out?", "OP, I'm so sorry for the loss in your family and for the unfolding risk to your niblings' well-being.\n\nI'm not expert. I thought there was a lot of wisdom in the top comment. On the other hand, I considered the possible pros and cons of raising the possibility with your brother of him giving you custody of the children:\n\n* Pros: Since Brittany has already expressed the opinion that the two kids should stay with you and that she doesn't want to play stepmom to 'two brats,' using that fact to suggest it would be wise for Nathan to give you custody if intends to marry and make a life with Brittany... it could snap Nathan awake to what he is willing to do for Brittany and what kind of parent Brittany is going to be. That might help him change course before, rather than after marrying her. Other pros might be that (if Nathan does give you custody), you can get them the counseling they will need (and are not likely to get with Nathan).\n* Cons: He could decide to keep the kids away from you, making it harder for you to help them. He could let you get custody, then regret it at a later date... However, this is not as big a con to me as you might think. It's not so much his well-being that you have to consider, but the kids. If he keeps the kids and allows Brittany to destroy their sense of security and love... and fails (very likely) to give them any access to mental healthcare - well, whatever time it might take him to 'snap out of it' is time those kids are being traumatized. I'd rather keep the kids safe as soon as possible than worry about Nathan's later regrets. If he really wakes up at some later date, the kids will have been safe with you instead of exposed to Brittany's toxicity and Nathan can work to earn and rebuild his relationship with his kids. They would most certainly need time to trust him again (if they ever could)\n\nOf course, I think you could discuss this with a family law lawyer or family therapist to get their perspective. Whatever you do, I think the North Star should be what is best for the kids. At the moment, that is definitely them staying with you. The only question is what's the best approach.", "NTA. This is an awful situation. Honestly, it\u2019s probably best that you try to see an attorney to see if you could get custody and still get child support from their father. They\u2019re also probably getting survivor\u2019s benefits, so even if there\u2019s no legal mechanism to get child support, at least this would be an option.", "If Brittany has already stated she wants the kids gone after they have a baby, you should maybe offer to just go ahead and take them. You know, so their marriage can get off to a good start, and the peace/quiet will make it easier to get pregnant....\nIf they voluntarily go ahead and hand the kids off to you, that should make a petition easy peasy to win.", "NTA what is wrong with your brother! Has he completely forgotten about his kids? This woman sounds awful.", "NTA. I am so disgusted and appalled by your brother's actions. As him why he doesn't want to be with his kids. Ask him what Sarah would think of this. It's time to confront him like a sledge hammer to a melon before he actually marries that monster. Definitely don't do so with her present otherwise there is no chance you'll break through. It's time to stop being nice because he's living in a delusion of stifled grief through complete avoidance. I mean jesus fucking christ, he started dating someone only three months after his wife's death! He needs to snap the fuck back to reality if he ever wants to be a real person/man/father again.", "He needs serious grief counseling. Did anyone ask him hiw he thinks Sarah would feel about all this?\n\nSorry for your loss. And need at least power of attorney or something to that effect for possible medical and school decisions.", "I\u2019m not suggesting you should follow through with this, but if you told Brittany that you were no longer willing to care for the kids, do you think she would bail on your brother?\n\nJust curious: are you sure she had a sister? NTA.", "NTA, Unfortunately his grief, found a predator.\nBLESS YOU, and his children. Gain custody. \nBe there when he comes to his SENSES. Hopefully before he has children with her.\nPrayers going forward", "NTA but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting custody unless Nathan agrees. \n\nTalk to a local attorney if you want more information/options\u2014", "NTA", "You should have your brother sign you a delegation of parental authority document, or whatever your state calls it. Tell him it\u2019s in case of emergency. But it\u2019ll give you some legal ground to parent those children", "Your NTA someone has to be a parent to your kids if your brother can't/wont its up to you, better to do it now when there isn't much damage instead of later", "NTA. \n\nI married a widower. \nIt sounds like he\u2019s rebounding with Brittany.\n\nDon\u2019t do what would sever ties with those children, they need you!", "i kinda think the first step is to get the kids to take all their mom's photos and precious memories out of the house before that witch tosses them.", "I think you should wait to petition the courts and document everything that happens including every messed up conversation. \n\nGather more evidence. How much the kids are staying with you. How much their dad checks in on them while they are with you, etc. I don't know how much luck you'll have if you go to the courts and claim it's because your brother has a new fiance, often wants a babysitter, who is taking down pictures, moving too fast, etc. Those don't sound like reasons a person's children get taken away and they lose their rights. \n\nIt most likely would get denied and your brother so mad that you don't ever see those kids again.", "NTA  They need to know that they are wanted by someone. They also need to be in therapy. His wife would have been so disappointed in him.", "NTA\n\nYou're overthinking this a bit. You can have a lawyer draft up papers for your brother to sign that give you the ability to get your nieblings medical care and handle schooling. \n\nMy husband I and have done this with his parents. We gave them a signed permission slip that said they had permission to travel with our kids and to get healthcare for them as needed when they took our kids on a trip to visit my brother in law's family. You don't actually have to have a lawyer draw it up, but in this case, I think being advised by a lawyer might be a good idea. \n\nAlso, slightly unrelated: the kids' therapist may not be able to talk to you about what happens in their sessions, but you absolutely can talk to the therapist about what you have observed about Brittany and her behavior towards the children. You can also tell her about your intention to provide a safe haven for the kids, since your brother is not being a father right now.", "It's just picking what Brittany would consider the wrong favourite- eg not her kids", "There was case where parent secretly put recording device in child's backpack.  Got in trouble because neither party gave consent/knew it was there.", "Yeah, also to add OP should bide her time to accumulate evidence.\n\nThe brother will to fight it tooth and nail if OP petitions for custody. There's zero chance he'll be happy paying child support and people have extreme emotional reactions to this kind of thing in general even if they are neglectful. If there isn't enough evidence then the childrens situation could end up a lot worse than it is right now. Biding her time and keeping a log of every single little detail is likely the safest bet for now.\n\nShe should record her brothers girlfriend saying this shit as it will go a long way to showing exactly how toxic she is. And before anyone brings up legality: even if you live in a two-party state, there are literally always exceptions in both written law and case law for safety concerns and just about any other concerns related to protecting yourself from illegal or significantly problematic behaviour. Basically as long as you have a reasonable concern about such a thing it's fine if you're a party to the conversation (though whether something will be admitted as evidence is a separate matter).", "This is where a lawyer will be to your advantage.\n\nA lawyer can be hired to represent the children and ensure that their needs are being met and maintained, as well as ensure that the accounts can not be used outside of the children themselves.  \n\nLegally, I think you are on shaky ground doing this on your own- as well as it may continue to further the wedge between you and your brother- but a lawyer hired for the two of them will ensure that their needs are being met and can achieve this goal impartially.", "Start writing dates and times that y\u2019all have had the kids. It\u2019s borderline abandonment what\u2019s happening.  Write down the conversation you had with Sarah, the courts look at all of that.\n\nNTA OP. I hope your brother wakes up from her.", "There is a process in the US (if that's where you're located) that would appoint you and potentially your husband as legal guardians of your niblings. Nathan would not lose his parental rights, and you would not have to have a formal custody order or child support order if you didn't care to. But the legal guardian paperwork would allow you to make medical decisions in an emergency and allow you to interact with the school in a parental role.\n\nA lawyer would be able to walk you through the process (very straightforward if everyone is in agreement) and lay out exactly how the arrangement would work in your jurisdiction.", "I think you should flat out ask your brother to sign them over. In this state, he\u2019s willing to do whatever. But what will be interesting is when he\u2019s either tired of her or finally awake, how much damage he has caused will finally sink in. You guys are a good aunt/uncle.", "prenup is needed. 100% talk to a lawyer. I did not and had issues with a divorce. Something that will always be a huge regret.", "If she's bold and secure enough even before the wedding to say openly she wants to get rid of the kids in front of you and their father, you can be sure she won't sign a prenup that protects the children's interests, and take any money your brother can access to..\n\nStart compiling evidence before making any move, and assume she'll know anything you tell your brother,so don't give her ammunition.", "Actually or have a lawyer sign up papers saying Nathan and chick sign over their rights to you and have Nathan still pay child support", "lol. People lie ALL THE TIME in court. Every day. Not rare at all. Yes, I\u2019m a lawyer. \n\nAnd there\u2019s no way she\u2019s getting custody unless dad agrees.", "She sounds like an abuser who saw a vulnerable man with money. I'm so sorry you're going through this.", "When she said outright that the kids would be going to you once they had a baby what did your brother say?!", "You definitely need to talk to a family lawyer.  You should have educational guardianship documentation at minimum since the kids are in school.  Also any medical power of attorney/guardianship.  I would talk to your brother.", "You need at least a medical power of attorney in order to get them treatment if something happens. Both my kids are disabled and when one would travel with a friend/their parents for holidays I would do a signed, notarized medical power of attorney and also provide a copy of my insurance card.", "If Nathan is willing, he can sign a release form allowing the therapist to share information with you. What you want is (as others may have said) a healthcare proxy aka medical power of attorney at a minimum. But this does not have to be achieved by you and Nathan fighting, if he\u2019s willing to do it voluntarily.", "If the father decides to consent to the guardianship after discussing, they can hire a lawyer together to make it happen amicably. But if OP takes them to court, that\u2019s a hostile interaction from the start. If they can work together for the children\u2019s benefit, the kids might even continue to have some relationship with their father and his new wife and their half sibling/s.", "See if you can get your brother to sign a Power of Attorney for you for the kids that covers medical, school, therapy, and legal decision making. You can broach this as needed if you and your husband are to help with the kids so he and Brittany can have time to work on their relationship. That will at least give you peace of mind to be able to handle things for the kids, and your brother time to hopefully wake up and realize what he is doing to his family.", "I did say it can happen in the case of abandonment, but the parents have to have actually abandoned the kids.  Dropping them off, even for days at a time, doesn\u2019t meet that standard by itself.", "Ooohhh that\u2019s interesting. So - the child didn\u2019t consent, either?  Which begets the question, what age is the threshold for providing consent to be recorded\u2026? Would the child\u2019s consent have withstood judicial scrutiny? (We didn\u2019t cover this twist in my 2L evidence class!)", "This is probably the best route if it's an option.  Make sure to stress to him that you won't be taking his rights away, but this will allow you to better care for them in the case of an emergency.", "but that still matters very little, what must be proven is that the father of the children is incompetent as a father, so unless they prove indisputably that the children suffer such serious abuse that it could cause the father to lose custody, it is impossible to The children's father could send them to a military boarding school so he would never see them and it would not even fall into the category of abandonment or abuse, so there is nothing to do."]}
