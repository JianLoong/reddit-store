My late sister in law Sarah was killed by a drunk driver 9 months ago. They had 2 kids together Millie (6F) and Ryan (9M). My husband (42M) Justin and I have been helping my brother with our niece and nephew since my SIL passed. We have 3 kids of our own and it\u2019s been nice to let the cousins hang out a bit more.\n\nNathan starting dating Brittany (26F) about 6 months ago and they are planning a wedding taking place first weekend of November. Lately Nathan has been dropping the kids off with us more and more for over night stays, including school nights, so he and Brittany can \u201cgo blow off steam.\u201d It\u2019s probably 4-5 nights a week at this point. I know people grieve differently but this feels really fast. Millie and Ryan are also having a hard time as Brittany has moved into the house with them and started removing pictures of Sarah. Nathan told her not to do this but she keeps going and pushing saying things like \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nNathan and I have always been close and Sarah was the sister I never had. I\u2019ve talked to him a few times about moving too quickly with Brittany and maybe taking a step back and let this grow. I told him if he wants to marry her now, if she\u2019s really the one that won\u2019t change with more time before a wedding happens. I\u2019ve also talked to him about Millie and Ryan needing stability and their dad consistently because they are hurting and still processing. He told me I crossed a line with bringing the kids up and he was doing the best he can. \n\nCut to yesterday. Brittany mentioned to Justin and I that Millie and Ryan would need to stay with us permanently once they have a baby so \u201cNathan doesn\u2019t show favorites.\u201d I stared at Nathan for a second and said this wasn\u2019t appropriate conversation to have when the kids were in earshot. Brittany said she didn\u2019t care and wasn\u2019t looking forward to playing step mom to the two \u201cbrats.\u201d Millie and Ryan are great kids but their world has been shattered with the loss of their mom and now Brittany having moved in and apparently marrying Nathan.\n\nI asked Nathan if we could speak privately and Brittany butted in saying anything I needed to say to him I could say to her. Against my better judgement I said \u201cFine. You\u2019re overstepping your place in this family and using my brother as a meal ticket. Those kids should come first.\u201d I thought her head was going to explode. She began yelling at me and that I was selfish for not wanting my brother to be happy. I told her it was time to grow up and realize the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. Nathan told me I was out of line and played the \u201cThat\u2019s my fiancee!\u201d card before they both stormed out, leaving the kids yet again. He has yet to check in on them\n\nAt this point I don\u2019t trust my brother\u2019s judgement and don\u2019t want to keep the kids but Justin and I feel like we don\u2019t have another choice. I want to keep them safe and gove them some stability.

If you are willing to have your niece and nephew stay with you for awhile (and can afford to do this), ask your brother if they can.

You\u2019ve got to show that the parent is committing pretty severe abuse or neglect, and generally speaking, dropping the kids off with a safe adult to supervise them doesn\u2019t begin to meet the kind of standard we\u2019re talking about here.  I can\u2019t speak for other countries, but in the US, it\u2019s very hard to get the court to give you custody of your niblings against the wishes of a living parent.

Your brother is TA, but he has custody.  So if you anger him, he could keep the kids and they will be miserable.  Right now your brother is only thinking about his needs and not his kids.  You can\u2019t fix that.  It\u2019s something he is going to have to figure out on his own.\n\nIn the meantime, I would suggest you be really nice to them and apologize for blowing up.  Then suggest that rather than this day to day thing of dropping the kids off, why doesn\u2019t he just let the kids stay with you during the week and optionally on the weekends as he desires, until her gets settled in with his new wife.  Ask if you can have some of the pictures of the late wife or ask the kids to snatch some up to stick in their bags to bring to your house.  By doing it this way, you are getting the kids on a reliable schedule, you are making it easy for your brother to leave them with you.  Once they are regularly staying at your place, the new wife will make sure that are too busy to take the kids on the weekends.  So, now you will have the kids all the time with the permission of the dad.  Once you have them for that long, then you can go see a lawyer about filing for on the grounds of abandonment\u2026.\n\nYou can\u2019t fix your brother.  He is all about his new wife, and she has made it clear she doesn\u2019t want the kids around.  And when she said that he didn\u2019t stand up for his kids.  He is lost to his kids. So the best thing you can do for them is to let them move in with you for as much as your brother wants.  Give them the stability that they need.  He isn\u2019t going to fight to have them.  \n\nDo, make sure he signs a medical POA for the kids so that if you have to take them to the ER or doc appts, you have permission to make decisions.\n\nIf you file for custody now, you may cause him to fight you on it, rather than him just letting them go, until you have enough evidence for legal guardianship.", "NTA of course.

If your brother is collecting them and not caring for the children, then your lawyer and Child Protective Services can help you here.\n\nOP, be very careful. Right now you are getting to keep the children with their father's consent. There have been cases where an unfit mother or father kept the children who would otherwise have been in a safe home until they realized possession of the children = free money. I am not saying that this is the case here, just something to be aware of when you evaluate your options.\n\nIf you get legal custody of the children, of course then they should get the benefit of any Social Security or other funds meant to help them, but tread carefully to make sure you can keep them safe.", "The kids do check checks that Nathan, when was in a better mind and with the help of our mom, are going into accounts set up for each kid respectively.

I said to someone else that I would attempt to get as much as possible by email without writing anything she doesn\u2019t want a judge to read. Nothing nasty because that comes across badly. But if she can get the gf/fianc\u00e9e to repeat what was said by email and get him agreeing with gf , that would count.
