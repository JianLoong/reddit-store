Your pain must be unimaginable. \n\nYour ex is just itching to blame someone, and that would be you,  because ultimately deep down he *knows* he is a sh!tty father and he let down his kid.\n\nHe is targeting you with those emotions, tied in with whatever he is experiencing due to this tragedy.\n\nIf he continues you need to ensure you are safe.\n\nNTA", "Wow. You are a better person than I am. I would have tried once and then told his mom and that\u2019s it. My conscience would be clear at that point. Him coming now and blaming you for his problems is an AH move and totally validates your decision to leave him. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nAnd.my guess is his family agreed, or they would have looped him in, made.plans to drive with him, etc.", "NTA. He's just mad that folks know he wasn't there and likely shamed him for it.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss \ud83d\udc99\n\nHe\u2019s not actually mad at you, somewhere inside he knows this is allllll on him. Sadly, because his way of running away from his pain is escaping reality (via intoxication) he has denied himself a very important part of his own reality, and now he\u2019s lashing out because he can\u2019t handle the truth which is that he did this to himself. Maybe this will be his wake up call, but even if it is you owe him nothing, and you especially don\u2019t owe him an apology.\n\nI am so very sorry you\u2019re dealing with this bullshit on top of such a terrible and tragic situation already \ud83d\udc99\n\nYou tried more than I would have in your situation and you have nothing to feel guilt about. Absolutely nothing.", "NTA. He would have still flaked but now he can play the victim.", "I\u2019m no way shape or form did you do anything wrong here. The arsehole is blaming you because he\u2019s too pathetic to understand he\u2019s a deadbeat that didn\u2019t deserve his son. Send a cease and desist and if he continues contact police. He has no right to burden you with that shit after everything you have endured. No right at all. Block him, he\u2019s not worth anything to you or your other children. \nI am so sorry for your loss, OP. I can\u2019t imagine your pain.", "NTA I've lost a child. If he had acted the way he did and then said that to me, I would have slapped him so hard.\n\nYou're not even close to being an asshole...but your ex?? MAJOR ASSHOLE.", "And note, he\u2019s such a loser that his family didn\u2019t drag him either.  You know darn good and well his mother tried to get him to attend his son\u2019s funeral.  If they gave up or thought it wasn\u2019t worth trying to get him to do it, then OP sure as heck is not responsible.", "This. \n\nWe can only pray that this is his rock bottom. Missing your child's funeral - and preceding illness - because you were to busy indulging habits is really, really low. \n\nI hope it's his rock bottom because I really don't know how you go lower than that, excluding death.", "This - and also, I'm so sorry for your loss and that this A is adding to the trauma with his selfish drug-fueled shenanigans.", "This says it perfectly \ud83d\udc47 NTA \n\n>NTA. He would have known when the celebration of life was happening due to his parents and siblings being invited. Sounds like he had plenty of opportunity to contact you regarding this but chose not to. He made his choice and now he has to live with the consequences. Perhaps this will push him to sobriety to better himself for the children that are still with you today", "His chance to say goodbye was when his son was alive, and he choose not to do that, so clearly he doesn\u2019t actually care. What an evil person", "Also I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "He should have taken an earlier one.", "the dead don\u2019t speak back to you his final chance to say goodbye was when his son was still here. OP gave him that chance and he ignored it ! he didn\u2019t show up when it mattered the most !", ">And note, he\u2019s such a loser that his family didn\u2019t drag him either. \n\nThis is what stuck out to me too. They knew he couldn\u2019t get it together enough to be there for his child\u2019s celebration of life. \n\nOP has so much on her plate right now and her ex\u2019s shit doesn\u2019t need to be her problem whatsoever.", "If he had been invited he'd have been drunk and made a scene. NTA at all", "Literally this. He could have chosen to step up for the last few weeks and he wouldn\u2019t have missed it.", "I'm sorry for your loss.", "ESH\n\nThe number of \u201calcoholics don\u2019t grieve they throw pity parties\u201d posts on here is despicable. \n\nHe still loved his sone even if his addiction didn\u2019t let him show it. \n\nHis actions made you exclude him, and you took away an opportunity for a father to mourn his son.", "How dare he. When you are ready, have processed your heartbreaking experience, feel you've managed your other children's grief and pain for the time being (as I'm getting the sense you already know this may be a much longer term mental and emotional recovery for both you and your children), when you feel you have the strength, support, all the evidence of this horrific series of events: go to court and keep yourself and your remaining children away from this man. Battling addiction or not, unless he's also bipolar or something (still not an excuse), you have a duty to yourself and your children to give maintain the loving environment that you can. You need to protect yourself because a) you deserve to be protected; and b) your children need your strength and stability now more than ever. \n\nYou do not have an obligation to give him any grace when it comes to your children if that grace comes with him doing more harm than good. Battling addiction should generally be met with compassion; you have no obligation to show compassion if it harms you or your children. \n\nHe needs to get better and that is his burden. He needs to show a demonstrated history of commiting to the process of getting better, actually showing a track record of having become better, and a consistent understanding of what he has put you all through: you, your remaining children, and your son who has already passed. Real remorse, that he doesn't flip back away from, doesn't give excuses for why he was so horrible. Unwavering clarity on how he needs to earn the right to be around any of you. \n\nGet you and your kids TF away from him until all the above measures (and frankly more) have been met. Cement your right for these expectations needing to be met with a case worker, an attorney, the court system, however you can. \n\nAnd then don't look back. You need to focus on your and your children's path forward after this experience. Make the legal system hold him accountable. Take zero compromise from even his family members you are most closest to. You and your kids are trauma survivors and you're still in survival mode.", "Yes", "YTA of the highest order.", "Nta", "NTA, I'm sure he is mad as hell, but even if he won't accept it the person he is mad at is himself\n\nEdited to fix an autocorrect", "NTA:\n\n>A few weeks ago, my son passed and I still cannot believe I\u2019m typing that.

He did not answer", "NTA", "NTA OP.\n He\u2019s looking for a reason to use again .", "So sorry for your loss. That ex is going to play being a victim and blame you for \u201ceverything\u201d wrong in his life. Op, don\u2019t fall for the mind-games; don\u2019t ever fall for him trying to guilt-trip you. Stay strong for your other children and take care of yourself. NTA, in any way.", "He chose inebriation over closure with his child. As it is with an abuser he\u2019s looking to place blame anywhere but where it should be, with him. \n\nYou reached out, he didn\u2019t care. Now it\u2019s too late. That\u2019s his burden to bear for the rest of his life, not yours.", "I'm so sorry", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA and I am so sorry you lost your son. The last thing you need to deal with is him. Hugs and healing.", "NTA", "NTA. You didn't \"steal\" that from him. His addiction did. Hopefully that will help him get sober. You have no guilt here.", "NTA. This drunk loser knew you and probably others tried contacting him. Hell I can guarantee on the day of the funeral people there were contacting him to come. He was on his ass drunk! Idk what went on his life to make him like that but he needs some serious rehab", "Fu*k that moron.  He knew,he just couldn't do anything apart from get messed up and party to care about anything.  And this is what happens when you do that...  and in typical addict fashion, it now has to be everyone else's fault he missed out on life by choosing to go on a bender.  He didn't deserve to be there anyway.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. HuGs\ud83d\udc97\n\nDon\u2019t ask strangers on the internet for this type of advice. You don\u2019t need that on top of everything else you are NTA\n\nYou have every right to choose who you say goodbye to your son with. He would just ruin it. He can have say goodbye in his own.", "yer good", "NTA. You gave him more than enough chances to be there. He made his choice. None of that is on you at all.", "Way to make the death of his son to be all about him.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. No matter how much you know it's coming, you can't prepare for it.\n\nNTA", "I'm truly sorry for your loss.\n\nHe's got gilt from not being there so he's blaming you. It's the typical addict mentality it's everyone else's fault for the things that go wrong in their life and never theirs.", "NTA and block his number. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. He has no ability to take accountability for his own actions. And no way to regulate his own emotions except to make someone else feel shitty. By putting someone else down or make someone else feel miserable is the only way he can feel better about himself. He doesn't care that he skipped the funeral, he just wants to hurt you so you can feel better about himself.", "OP, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.  May your son\u2019s memory be a blessing.\n\nNTA.  And if your ex ever gets sober, he will realize it, too.", "My sincerest condolences. \ud83e\udec2", "You took every reasonable step to get in touch with him. It's not your fault that he was out of communication.\n\nDocument *everything* he says or does from this point onwards. If he escalates, you'll be glad you had a record of that escalation.\n\nNTA.", "He's an addict. Being an addict. Not taking responsibility. Keep him out of your life. Wishing you peace and healing.", "NTA This is very similar to my BILs adult children. My sister told them for over a year that he didn\u2019t have much time left and they just blew him off. Then all the drama started after he died. You gave him chances over and over again. He needs to own that he is the f*ck up and leave you alone.", "Absolutely NOT! NTA NTA.  I'm so so so sorry for your loss.  \n\nYou reached out and he was unavailable.   He knew from his family being invited.  He could've reached out to you. He didn't.  He doesn't get to put the responsibility on you for his regrets.  HE didn't come see his son.  HE didn't come at his last moments. HE didn't call when you reached out to him his mom and his friends.  If he feels regret for missing those moments, he needs to own up to that, not deflect his feeling to you.  \n\nIf he wants to, he can still hold his own celebration of your sons life.  But he won't.  Bc that's hard.  He has to make arrangements, make preparations, invite people.  So he won't and blame you.  Being an addict and an alcoholic is an explanation not an excuse.  Yes he did or didn't do many things bc he was an addict and alcoholic.  But it's still his responsibility to be there and he wasn't.  \n\nI hope one day he'll recover and realize that.  But for now, forget him and focus on you, your grief and tending your children.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA he was called multiple times very sorry for your loss", "NTA. You did everything you could to reach out to your son's father. His family would have let him know when the service was on, too.\n\nHopefully, your ex will change his ways.\n\nI am so, so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. The ex husband missed his son\u2019s funeral because he has issues with an addiction. NOT bc OP has boundaries. My condolences for your loss.", "NTA. I wonder if he actually wanted to attend it at all but got some flack from people who noticed he wasn\u2019t there.", "I think the ex is trying to Gaslight OP into thinking she\u2019s the asshole. She said it herself he\u2019s an abusive person and they tend to blame others for their actions.", "And he abused the mother of his children. Toss off.", "Nuh uh.", "Did u not read ehat she wrote", "op\u2019s ex hit her and abused her, the mother of his children. He doesn\u2019t deserve any sympathy or pity.", "Oh, they certaily told him about it. Opie didn't.", "He had an angle and ulterior motive, there's something he wants out of it beyond just a lack of culpability for not being there at all. Otherwise he would have just spread self-pitying, self-excusing rumors that she would have heard, rather than him drunkenly showing up to her actual house. My gut intuition is there was an intentional power play in motion there, even if I can't quite put my finger on it. Anybody with more experience with this particular flavor of bastard ex-husband who can read it?", "And blaming others", "Perhaps he\u2019s upset that he didn\u2019t get to make a performance out of grieving for a lot of witnesses at the funeral.", "Yuh uh.", "Honestly if he\u2019s an addict I\u2019d say he\u2019s hoping for life insurance money", "Nuh uh uno reverse card."]}
