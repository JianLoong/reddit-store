Forget him he's not important. Be there for you and yoir kids. Your an amazing mother I can tell. He's abusive this is what abusive people do they rock havoc and blame victims.

That was his final chance to say goodbye.", "NTA\n\nYou tried, he failed his son again.

Your ex sounds so emotionally abusive and manipulative and I am so sorry for your loss. It is a dark time for you right now and you have to try getting some light in your life. The first thing to do is cut all ties and any contact with your ex.\n\nI wish you the absolute best in life, your ex is the asshole here, not you.\n\nI would have done the same.", "Nta don\u2019t let him manipulate you.

I'm sorry that you have to deal with this extra stress on top of everything else you're going through right now.", "NTA. He failed as a father during your son\u2019s life.

I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, if everyone else in his family knew then there is no way he didn't know when and where to go. He's using you not inviting him as an excuse for his failure to show up.", "So sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA. He is doing what I guess he always do: insulting and shaming everyone - specially you - for his own faults. Don't listen to him. Next he will say he can't recover from abusing substances because you took away from him the chance to say goodbye to his son. Again: DON'T give anything on what he is saying or will in the future. He is running away from his own shortcomings and mistakes. It has absolutely nothing to do with you.", "Obviously NTA. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.

You DID reach out to him multiple times and he didn't respond.  So I think he's the one in the wrong here.  It's on him if he ignored the calls/msgs (if you left one).  NTA on your part.", "NTA. It would be in your best interest to save any proof of harassment (texts, voicemails, emails, security cam footage, etc) on the chance that this turns into a bigger problem. File police reports. Pursue an order or protection if necessary.\n\nI am so deeply sorry for your loss. You shouldn't have to deal with this BS at what I imagine is the worst moment of your life right now.", "I am so, so sorry for your loss.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA and why would you think you were? You literally did everything you could. He had his opportunity when your son was still alive and he's trying to blame you for his inability to deal with reality among other things.\n\nHe's also using this situation to continue to abuse you. Time to go no contact, permanently. Protect yourself and protect your other children.", "NTA. He would have known when the celebration of life was happening due to his parents and siblings being invited. Sounds like he had plenty of opportunity to contact you regarding this but chose not to. He made his choice and now he has to live with the consequences. Perhaps this will push him to sobriety to better himself for the children that are still with you today", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss, I can't imagine your pain. You tried and you tried and you had the right to stop trying. You had the right to give yourself the opportunity to grieve and you still do.\n\nIt sounds like your ex knows he messed up and is using you as a target for his grief. I'm sure he knows you tried but it's easier to process anger at you than anger at himself for  his own actions.", "NTA.   Your ex's addiction kept him away from his son's funeral.", "NTA at all. I am so, so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour ex had countless opportunities to be there for your son throughout his life, but he wasn\u2019t. His sense of entitlement is incredible.", "First, I'm very sorry for your loss.\n\nYou did reach out several times to your ex, he was aware that your son was terminally ill, and I'm sure that his family let him know the details of your son's homegoing service. You are NTA and have absolutely nothing to feel guilty over. \n\nPlease ignore your ex. His decisions are what caused him not to be there.", "NTA. He had his chance to be there for your son when he was ill, and he couldn\u2019t even manage that. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  I'm sorry for your loss.. how incredibly sad for you.\n\nThe reality is, he KNEW his son was gravely ill.  He only managed a brief , drug addled visit. When your son passed, he ignored all attempts at your contact.  From my POV.. you gave him every opportunity to be there for his son while he was alive.. and even to be there immediately after.. and he for the most part was a no show.. like he was for most of your son's life.\n\nThen.. you did invite his family to the service.. is there no reason why one of them might have told him?  that he could have reached out to see if he was welcome.. or come anyway..because he was his father? NOPE.. \n\nSo, you are NTA and if his dad is looking back with guilt.. maybe suggest he go to rehab and get some therapy to deal with the fact that he was a failure of a father to his son.", "I'm so sorry about your son. You're NTA, and your son's sperm donor is a vile human being who is trying to turn the loss of his son into a pity party for himself. He didn't celebrate his son's life when he had the chance.  No need for him to be there after he passed.I hope that you can be rid of him forever.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm glad you have support in your BF and your in-laws (ex in laws).\n\nPlease please please don't let your ex occupy any space in your head or heart. He's an addict who couldn't get it together enough to support you and spend time with his child while he was in the hospital. When his support would have been needed the most. That would've been the time to say goodbye. You gave him every opportunity and he chose some substance over his own child's feelings.\n\nThis makes me so upset on your behalf (you and your children).\n\nThis is 100%on him. Don't let him make you feel more rotten than you already feel.\n\nHugs to you.", "Nta and i could think of a few other terms  for sperm\nDonor", "NTA - sorry for your loss. You need serious counseling for all of the abuse this man put you through. You shouldn\u2019t care what he thinks, you did everything you could to reach him and have done nothing to wrong that man. He is still making you think you did something wrong and that, in and of itself is wrong.\n\nNot a fan of most 12-step programs but Alnon is for the families people with addiction, and it might help. I\u2019d get individual counseling too for you and for your other children.", "ah, another case of \"immediately judged OP as the AH by title alone and then read the post and went jesus christ NTA\"", "NTA\n\nIf you had never invited him to come and say the last goodbyes then it'd be different.

You did your best with an albatross of an ex.

Now he has the audacity to try to blame you, saying he'll never get the chance to grieve? I don't think so.\n\nI'm so, so sorry for your loss.", "As his father, that man should have been helping you plan the celebration of life. If he had been performing even a few of his parental duties or checked in with you or his other relatives even once, he\u2019d have known when/where the event was taking place. His side of the family was there. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to learn the details of his sons funeral. NTA", "First off, I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nNTA because you did try to invite him and he couldn't be bothered to respond to your calls. Also, his family could have invited him and maybe they told him but he didn't remember. You are also grieving and were very kind to try to include him and his family in the funeral. Hopefully this may be a wake up call for him to get sober because HE is the one who chose to miss the funeral by refusing to respond to you. I don't see how you did anything wrong here.   Also, his grief is NOT your responsibility.   \n\nTake care.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. And for the added stress your ex is piling on. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. You tried to contact him. Frankly, even if you had told him, he may not have attended anyway. \n\nAs for him saying you\u2019ve denied him closure, you haven\u2019t. Attending a funeral or celebration of life is not necessary to grieve in a healthy way. Lots of people are unable to attend these events, and still find the closure they need in time. \n\nWhat your ex is upset about is now EVERYONE can see what a deadbeat father he was. And that\u2019s on him.", "NTA. Parental rights only go so far. You can't celebrate life if he's there.", "NTA he's a jerk", "NTA. I am so sorry you are having to go through all of this. My thoughts are with you. Addiction is a beast. It becomes so complex, and even more so when children are also involved. \n\nYou invited those who demonstrated care and were involved in his life- they could have mentioned to him if they thought it was appropriate or necessary.
