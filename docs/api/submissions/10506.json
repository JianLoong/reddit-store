He comes home after this dead tired and sunburnt and in a bad mood.\n\nShe defends this by saying she is \"building his character\" and \"giving him a work ethic\" but she is actually misleading him  in a  most disgusting way.  She has him convinced that he desperately NEEDS a brand new Jeep like his Tio has (My stepson is capable of driving and has a licence and has a perfectly good used car we gave him).

His grandma is being manipulative and mentally and emotionally abusive. Does he see a therapist or doctor for meds? You need to mention it to them and see if they can help at all.

What that woman is doing is abuse, she is totally taking advantage of him. Your wife should be stepping in there to protect her son from this woman as well. I know it's her mother, but this is not okay...", "NTA.  I have an autistic family member so I have an understanding of the issue.  You have to make him see he is getting underpaid.  Maybe pay your stepson a reasonable amount of money to do the same work at home. Then tell him that he could save for his car faster if he charged that type of money.  Maybe that would get him to recognize he should be paid more?", "NTA. Your step son needs an advocate. He sounds a lot like my autistic son. You want to build a work ethic then you teach them what work is worth, not just to do what you're told for pennies and promises.", "YWNBTA, but your wife should be more involved here. She and grandma are the assholes.", "Can you call adult protective services?", "NTA. It sounds like you need a bigger army behind you if you want to foster any change though. Right now you're on an island and you can't even get your stepson to see your point-of-view.", "NTA. Your MIL and wife are.", "NTA. I'm happy he has someone that cares about his well-being and is in his corner.

Is there someone your wife would listen to who could convince her how wrong this is? Is there any reason she won't discuss it with you? Does your stepson have any therapist or doctor he would listen to? Is there an advocate service for Autistic people that would be able to reach out? It is so morally wrong for him to be abused like that. I'm hoping that there is some service that could help him. Would publicly shaming MIL be effective on SM? Please keep trying to help him. Tell your wife she needs to act like a mother and protect her son.", "NTA. Autistic people are not automatons. They're not slaves. They're not free labor. It's disgusting what she's doing and you should look her in the eye and tell her as much, consequences be damned.

If she wants to help him build character she can do it by not using him for her own selfish gains.", "Nta but I\u2019d probably start offering him $20 to just stay home. Well you will be hot and grouchy here I\u2019ll just pay you what grandma would and you can just go shoot hoops.", "Why don't you undermine her efforts by offering him a bit more money to do less. Maybe after he skips out of her work a few times, she'll get the hint. NTA treating people like shit builds character too, just not the good kind.", "NTA. Tell your MIL that from now on, you'll act as your stepson's agent, and negotiate his fee for jobs her performs (or, ask a highly trusted family member/friend to handle this role if you'd prefer not to) Then you can put his money in an interest-bearing account. You might also want to see if a local disability organization or a community college offers some kind of Personal Finance 101 course to help him begin to understand how to manage money.", "NTA, she's taking advantage of him.", "NTA.  I had a similar situation in my family.  It was my cousin in this situation.   Something that worked was when my mother (who was \u201cyou\u201d) sat my cousin down and showed him the minimum wage he could be earning.\n\nFirst she researched a bunch of employment agencies that helped to place people like my cousin.   She did the initial contact, spoke to the coordinators, and got the information my cousin needed.\n\nThen she sat my cousin down with some paper and did some math.\n\nShe literally calculated how many hours he\u2019d have to work to buy the [jeep] when working for [aunt.].  $20 for 8 hours is $2.50/hour.   If the truck costs $40k, he\u2019d need to work 16,000 hours to make that much and not spend a cent.\n\nThen she calculated how much he\u2019d make if he worked minimum wage in any one of these jobs the agency could offer him.  Absolute minimum wage right now is $7.\n\nAt $7/hour, he\u2019d need to work 5,715 hours to make that 40k.   Even accounting for taxes, that\u2019s a huge difference.  \n\nIf you lay that out for him, then help connect him to an agency that specialises in placing people with his condition, you might succeed in breaking your MIL\u2019s hold on him.\n\nIf she\u2019s angry, ask her why she\u2019s upset that your nephew is succeeding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
