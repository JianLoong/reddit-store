And I get that they don't see your stepdaughter as family.  Fine.  BUT.  They're adults.  *They're deliberately excluding a girl they've known since she was seven.*  They have to know these kids live together.  They don't even try to acknowledge the other girl?  How cruel.  It's like they're deliberately taking every opportunity they can to tell **a child** to fuck off.  They don't have to accept her as family to be NICE TO A CHILD. She didn't ask to be part of this family.  How are you okay with these people treating someone innocent like this? You suck for putting up with this BS for years and letting them buy your daughter \"expensive gifts\".  I can guarantee you your daughter doesn't need half of what she gets. If they really want to help her they could start a college fund, instead of rubbing it in the daughter and your wife's faces. You should have made it clear this girl was your daughter years ago, and them treating her as anything less is not cool.  You're the only Dad she's got.  Act like it.", "Yeah this is a hard one but I'm with your wife on this one, and think your family's actions are of poor judgement. I guess the only thing you can do, is do your best to match their gifts with your own for your stepdaughter and call them out on how it makes your wife feel. Importantly, you have to be a united front, you should be equally offended by this as I guess you're funding the everyday expenses of both girls?", "I don\u2019t think anybody is the asshole/or is not the asshole in this situation. Both of you have a point. But it will never be fair. Taking your biological child\u2019s gifts away isn\u2019t fair, because she doesn\u2019t have everything to do with why your siblings don\u2019t like your non-biological child. But your wife has a point, children should always be treated as equally as possible. Of course it is awful for a child, or rather a teenager, to see your sibling get more gifts than yourself. This issue should be addressed by you and your wife towards your siblings. But never take things away from children when they are not at fault for something. Still address this topic with your family though, if you haven\u2019t already and tell them that the other child is in fact also your child now. Make it clear that you love her and would be happy if they accepted her as well. Hope things will work out for you all.", "Your siblings have no obligation to buy anything for anyone.

My suggestion is to keep most of the gifts outside of the knowledge of the other sibling(s). Honestly, as she gets older, your daughter will most likely grow to resent your siblings for ignoring her sister. I resent mine - I no longer accept gifts from then. And make sure your other daughter knows she is loved.", "YTA - Fair or not, there's a good chance that this will cause your step-daughter to resent your daughter. Let your inlaws know that, going forward, you expect them to treat your daughters equally.", "NTA you have no control over what ppl buy or gift to your child..if your wife feels so strongly about these items she needs to start saving to get them/ you two go half on them...your daughter shouldn't suffer over this", "NTA", "NTA.
