This issue should be addressed by you and your wife towards your siblings. But never take things away from children when they are not at fault for something. Still address this topic with your family though, if you haven\u2019t already and tell them that the other child is in fact also your child now.

She should have made that effort years ago.\n\nStopping when your child was 7 from receiving expensive gifts would have been hard but not impossible. Stopping it now at 14 is going to bring a world of trouble into both your life\u2019s. The daughter will resent you, her and her child for interfering with the relationship she has with her aunts and uncles. I can guarantee she will hate you all.\n\nThe wife and you should have really had a discussion about all of this before you got married. What she wanted from you and your family regarding her daughter. Now you have waited 8 years. Any resentment on the step daughters part is already there.

A car her daughter probably will not be allowed access and free college. Now she wants to go in and rewrite the rules. \n\nThis is only going to make your family resent her and her daughter more than they do. Which I believe there is a bigger story there.

Even so, I'm not of a believe that Just because you married someone with kids, they become your kids Just like your bio. I think that's a bit naive and unreasonable.
