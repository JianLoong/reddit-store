This issue should be addressed by you and your wife towards your siblings. But never take things away from children when they are not at fault for something. Still address this topic with your family though, if you haven\u2019t already and tell them that the other child is in fact also your child now.

She should have made that effort years ago.\n\nStopping when your child was 7 from receiving expensive gifts would have been hard but not impossible. Stopping it now at 14 is going to bring a world of trouble into both your life\u2019s. The daughter will resent you, her and her child for interfering with the relationship she has with her aunts and uncles. I can guarantee she will hate you all.\n\nThe wife and you should have really had a discussion about all of this before you got married. What she wanted from you and your family regarding her daughter. Now you have waited 8 years. Any resentment on the step daughters part is already there. It isn\u2019t going to magically change when they buy her an iPad. \n\nMy guess with the amount of expensive gift daughter is getting from your family is now causing her to worry because she knows a car is on its way. A car her daughter probably will not be allowed access and free college. Now she wants to go in and rewrite the rules. \n\nThis is only going to make your family resent her and her daughter more than they do. Which I believe there is a bigger story there.

Not to mention she's hardly 'suffering' if she doesn't get a free laptop and other expensive items.", ">damn you raised them both she's supposed to be as much your daughter as the one who came from your balls\n\nAnd she may or may not be. BUT his siblings didn't marry her mother, they didn't raise the girl, their balls were not involved in any of this(I assume). Stepparents sign up to be parents and have a responsibility to treat all their kids equally and fairly, they can't sign up their entire bloodline and demand all their relatives take on the same responsibility.", "NTA I guess the only thing you can do, is do your best to match their gifts with your own for your stepdaughter and call them out on how it makes your wife feel. Importantly, you have to be a united front, you should be equally offended by this as I guess you're funding the everyday expenses of both girls?", "The family probably interacted with the girl for a year. They would treat them differently.....No one is the asshole here.He should establish some boundaries with his wife. They come from different backgrounds, such things happen, its bad to blame others.", "Step family need to understand that they\u2019re not entitled to the same treatment as existing family members. Smh", "hey, my daughter, you need to give half of the things you own to your step sibling (with whom you had no other choice but to get along with since I decided to re-marry)..... yeah, the daughter would go NC when she grows up... The wife should sue for child support, not blade the daughter or family.", "The stepdaugher isn't legally his child. His marriage with her mom doesn't make him responsible for her child in the law, he would have to adopt her for that.", "When has that ever gone over well?", "I would jot recommended sharing at all that a hole other hell he be navigating.", "Thanks, no problem, i feel rewarded regardless :D", "YTA\n\nThere is nuance here. They don\u2019t have to keep things totally equal. But it\u2019s been nearly a decade together.\n\nYour family\u2019s actions are gross.", "No, not suffering but how would you feel if your sibling received expensive gifts and you got nothing?", "In one of op\u2019s comments he said this:\n\nI think my daughter would have a better life if she has her college paid and an stepsister who doesn't like her rather than a lot of debt and an stepsister who likes her\n\n\nMakes me wonder if the new wife found out if the daughter is getting free college all the sudden and that why after 8 years she has decided she wants equality", "They have been together 8 years. His family is 100% the AH", "The child who has been in the family for over half their life DOES deserve to be treated as family.", "In one of op\u2019s comments he said this:\n\nI think my daughter would have a better life if she has her college paid and an stepsister who doesn't like her rather than a lot of debt and an stepsister who likes her\n\nMy guess is daughter will be gifted a car also. \n\nWhich makes me wonder after 8 years she is suddenly wanting equality.\n\n\nHer pushing for equality after 8 years is going to make this situation so much worse. If his family didn\u2019t already down right hate her they will now.", "If he does this his daughter will resent him, his wife and the mom.\n\nPersonally I wonder after 8 years why his family doesn\u2019t want anything to do with the sep daughter and new wife.", "You cannot make people buy gifts..... ofcourse they will favor the child they knew for 14 years rather then a child they knew for one year (married for one year).", "I grew up with a twin brother, it went over well more often than not.", "op did in fact leave a comment that his family *has* known the step daughter since she was 7.", "Ok honest question did the wife just find out about your daughter getting her college paid for by your family? Is this the reason she is wanting to suddenly make changes?", "Money is more important to you than relationships. Wow.\n\nMy siblings are my best friends 20+ years after I graduated college. They are constant through debts, struggles, change, etc. They'll be here when I'm old and gray and want to reminisce about my childhood.\n\nYou are definitely TA.", "Not at all", "They arent super rich and have known this girl for about a year...you cant expect that.", "Could be the poor step sister has noticed more now and is becoming upset about the treatment.", "Imagine saying \"Here is this other kid, now you have to share everything with her\"...its dads choice to get married, not the daughters...why should daughter suffer the consequences?", "You know what the difference is between your situation", "The difference is their is already a stressful relationship between step siblings. So this would add more tensions. And given dad don\u2019t buy any of it he can\u2019t really enforce sharing. It\u2019s not his to allow stepdaughter access.", "Absolutely not. In this case, OP should prioritize his relationship with his daugher. His daugher Will always be his daugher. Wife and stepdaugher can b\u00ea gone with a divorce paper.", "Until in most states a 14/15 year old can choose to move out and decide where they want to live. Considering she has family that would her her do so he will loose his daughter.\n\nIt sucks for the stepdaughter. But op needs to wonder if making his daughter hate him for choosing the stepdaughter and wife over her is worth it.", "These are stepsister. I honestly believe there is more to this story then op is telling. But honestly I figure their relationship is cordial at best. But the one thing I can guarantee if he stops his family from having anything to do with the daughter because of the stepdaughter given they are both teenagers his daughter will hate them all.", "\\*Seven\\* years.", "That might be a reason too.  \n\nBut honestly this has been going on for 8 years. I don\u2019t see how this ends well for anyone.\n\nAnd if the stepsister is just now noticing I wonder if they didn\u2019t live together prior.\n\nThen that would explain why the family doesn\u2019t have a relationship with her. And if they don\u2019t have a relationship with the stepdaughter then the new mom shouldn\u2019t expect them to treat the kids equal.", "When you live with others, you make concessions to keep things peaceful.  You act as if I said she should give these things freely, I just made a suggestion that may help in this situation.  A parent having to deal with kids arguing over sharing, is easier to deal with than two kids in the same house that actively hate each other because they are each treated differently by each parent.  They may as well divorce now if they aren't going to try to raise these kids together.", "Nevermind, someone else said that OP didnt legally adopt her....so....that might also be the reason...if even the OP wont make a move to legally adopt her, why should the extended family pick up the slack?", "There is more going on then op is saying.", "OP left a comment saying they have known the step daughter since she was 7 and the family lives close by.", "I figure this marriage will end in divorce. This went on for 8 years. I don\u2019t see how it ends happy  now.", "Knowing them and being close to them are two totally different things.\n\nIf the wife didn\u2019t let them bond with her daughter or realized they refused to bond with her daughter then this is as much on her as it is op. Maybe more so. The wife had to know the extent of how much the family spoiled the daughter. Instead of addressing it as a potential issue early on she married op and thought they magically accept her daughter who they may have known but didn\u2019t have a relationship with and not make a difference.", "No because when he does this he will damage the relationship with her aunt and uncle. A relationship she has had for 14 years.", "> Legally his child until they are divorced so that's just plain wrong.\n\nA stepparent is a legal stranger so you're wrong here.", "Their relationship is all about gifts? Huh? \n\n\u201cHey do me a favor, we appreciate all you do for daughter 1 but we really want both of these girls growing up feeling cared for & respected so would you do me a favor & just cut  back on the expensive gifts. Maybe show you care about her in other ways. We are a family now & both of these girls mean everything to our family.\u201d", "I honestly don\u2019t see how anyone wins in this situation personally.\n\nBut my guess is there is more to this story then op is telling but either way he and the wife let this happen for 8 years.\n\nIf he suddenly goes to his siblings and makes this demand because that is how they see it they will be pissed. They will be mad that they are being told what to do with their money. \n\nThen this ends this ways:\n\nThey step up the spending to give the wife a big fu for trying to tell them how to spend their money. Because they are not  going to comply!  And the only way to stop it you can ask all you want is to have them not have any contact with his daughter until they comply. So when this happens then yes it will effect daughters relationship with his family.\n\nThis then will end with the family hating the new wife more for getting their access to neice limited. \n\n\nPersonally I want to know why in 8 years they didn\u2019t get close to the wife and daughter. I also why after 8 years the wife is suddenly demanding this change.\n\n\nAnd you said that both of these girls mean everything to our family. That\u2019s the thing his family has no relationship with the step daughter they are going to view it as mom and stepdaughter making this a power move.\n\nI would 100 percent agree with you if he and the wife had not let this happen for 8 years!"]}
