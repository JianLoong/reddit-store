Ma\u2019am you are so NTA the doctors will worry about your movements. \n\nYou should ask your darling husband if he needs you to google translate your talking into French because clearly he is having beaucoup de trouble understanding you. As a loving wife it is only right that you can accommodate this interesting reason for him to apparently not be able to comprehend you ;). Peut-\u00eatre il sera tr\u00e8s heureux! \n\nBut to be real, he does not seem like the biggest catch of the lake to me. He is 9 years older than you and yet much more immature. Making big purchases and apparently developing English amnesia (aka not caring enough to listen). As my Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois great grandmother is not here to hire to spicy compliment him in Qu\u00e9bec French, please think if you can take like 60 more years of this. Quite a few of my relatives lived into the 90s and beyond. That\u2019s a long time of translating.", "Parenting your own children is NOT babysitting", "NTA. Your husband is a HUGE AH tho. He  clearly made that cake for his own benefit (probably enjoyed making it, bragging about it to your parents and likely getting praise from them, and eventually eating it), and didn't really care what you wanted. You told him you wanted alone time. He gave you the opposite of that, and made you parent alone on your birthday. Also was an AH for waiting til the evening of your birthday to make it. And for dropping down from a $500 kayak to a shitty home made cake (he could of at least bought you one).", "NTA. You stated what you wanted (and needed), he didn't \"hear\" you. My EX-husband used to do that. To get him to actually hear me, I'd gently grab his face, lock eyes with him and say \"No, you need to hear me and understand what I am saying. (then say what I want/need) Now, repeat that please.\"", "NTA. Next time you need a break, take one. Honey I\u2019m going out for 2 hours. You have the kids. If he is unresponsive to suggestions then you have to tell him what\u2019s going to happen and follow through. \n\nAnd 100% that kayak was intended for his use. I suggest you go watch the Simpsons episode where Homer buys Marge a bowling ball with his name engraved in it for her birthday.\n\nMight want to have a conversation with him about your daughter, his step daughter, and how she is not a child that he can get by with saying watching her is babysitting. Sure he doesn\u2019t have the same role as a bio father, assuming he\u2019s still in her life, but he is a secondary parent and he should never think of watching her as being any different than watching his own bio child. And you should never think of him watching her is doing you a favor or babysitting either. He\u2019s either building a family unit with you or he\u2019s not and that includes his step child.", "NTA. Be more blunt.", "NTA .. A KAYAK?!?!? I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA- you voiced what you wanted, he chose to ignore it. If it had been something he couldn't do, if it had been literally impossible, something that his job would keep him from doing or he physically could not do or handle then I could see him not doing it. But he chose *actively* to ignore what you clearly said you wanted, to instead make a cake that you never asked for, **and he knew was going to taste like shit**, and then call you ungrateful. After spending a huge chunk of money on himself prior to your birthday, and what you asked for didn't even involve money. He is absolutely the ahole; that is inconsiderate, uncompassionate, delusional on his part, and a huge red flag.\n\nPersonally, I'd throw the cake in his face and get myself out of the house by myself the entire next day and leave him with the kids. Absolutely not.", "If my husband ever called parenting babysitting I would call a lawyer.", "NTA, I\u2019d start by being more direct (\u201cI need you to watch the kids for the next two hours\u201d) and then escalate (\u201cI need you to watch the kids for the next two hours, or we are getting a divorce\u201d).", "NTA\n\num.... he wouldn't be \"babysitting\" his kids. Hed simply be parenting them. It's not babysitting when it's your own kids. \n\nAnd like i can see very clear hints here, but he's an ignorant dude obviously. Maybe next time tell him this is what you want and implement a time and put it into action. It doesn't make him any less of the ah here for what he did though, but some dudes are just really that clueless and you gotta be so direct sometimes that its like dumbifying things down for then to get it.", "NTA.\n\nAND ITS NOT BABYSITING IF THEY ARE HIS KIDS!!!! ITS PARENTING.    \n\nAnd maybe he should start doing it. \n\nHere is an idea... pick a day and plan some you time.  Make sure he is off from work. \n\nWake him up nicely and let him know you have gifted yourself a You Day.   You will be back for dinner and can't wait to see what he decides to serve. \n\nKiss him and leave b4 he has any idea what just happened. \n\nBonus points -- let the people he will call to watch the kids know ahead of time so they are \"unavailable\"\n\nReply to  all calls with a text... \" unless I need to meet you at the ER please allow me to enjoy my day.\". \n\nGood luck!", "It took him four hours and he bought the frosting?\n\nI want to see this cake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Uh... what? He shouldn't be \"babysitting\" his own kids, that's just called parenting. He agreed to have children, you should not have to ask him to take care of them - that's his responsibility as a father. There is obviously a lot more wrong than just this birthday situation. I think you need to address the fact that he's not pulling his weight as a parent.", "I'm sorry girl children are never the answer you tell him you wanted a partner in life and not just a sperm donor and he better start helping you raise them kids or your going after child support", "NTA If he can afford a $500 kayak, he can afford a $40 cake from a bakery, then watch take care of the kids while you eat the cake and relax for a few hours. You communicated clearly what you wanted and he ignored you.", "The baby is still breastfed and I don\u2019t have a stash of frozen so the longest I can be away is like 4 hours unfortunately but thank you for the suggestion", "It\u2019s funny he speaks some French!

That cake was for HIM not for YOU.\n\nNTA, OP. I would wake up tomorrow & say \"I'm taking my present to myself today\" and quite literally leave the house with a note on the door. You'll return in 12 hours. He can survive while you enjoy some peace.\n\nIf you come back & the house is chaos and the kids are hungry and he's yelling, ask him wtf is the point of having him around if he can't stay afloat for half a day?? Single parenthood would be easier!", "We\u2019re definitely learning and building our family unit right now. He has said he grew up with \u201ctraditional\u201d gender roles but I told him since that those aren\u2019t possible since I have to have a full time job to make up the difference of child support he has to pay for his other two children. I can\u2019t be the only one doing childcare/housework. It can\u2019t be \u201ctraditional\u201d and I work lol. I do get child support for my daughter from her dad since he only sees her 14 days out of the year though which helps.", "I don\u2019t actually know what it tastes like we just argued and then went our separate ways so it\u2019s just sitting on the table. It is very pretty but he also stuck real roses and leaves on it for decor so idk", "Good lord. This man couldn't manage to watch the kids for 4 hours? What a maroon.\n\nI'd still take that $500 and book yourself a series of something -- spa appointments? Painting classes? Skiing lessons? every [day you have off] for the next [whatever you can get] weeks. He can watch the kids in a series of 4 hour increments, you can get your time away, and you can gush to your friends and family about the amazing birthday gift he got you.", "In that case you should make clear to his relatives and yours his inability to care for the kids that badly. If he\u2019s such a good parent he\u2019d jump to learn and wouldn\u2019t go against his relatives lol", "Omg wow I was being a sarcastic little rascal haha. \n\nBeaucoup is much/lots/many as in having much trouble understanding. \n\nPeut-\u00eatre il sera tr\u00e8s heureux means maybe he\u2019ll be very happy lmao. \n\nIf he sees and comments on any grammar, have mercy s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet, mec. Je ne parle pas Fran\u00e7ais souvent, et j\u2019habite au Canada. Canadian French is a fun little mash of France French and Qu\u00e9bec French. \n\nAnd Qu\u00e9bec french is like Acadian French slightly modernized. When the Acadians were expelled by the English (this is for you OP as I am so excited I love sharing facts) some of them travelled to Louisiana. We were told in school they had kids with the local First Nations and bam Cajuns. \n\nSo fun fact for you today, OP! One of your husband\u2019s ancestors lived in the same early settlement my ancestor did. Acadia, the first recognized settlement in Canada all the way back in the 1600s (your husband might even be able to find that relative, we found ours)! Exciting!\n\nAnyways I do hope you come to a resolution, whatever it may be! And you get some dang time to yourself soon, birthday lady! Bonne anniversaire!", "You\u2019re not really sure if he thinks of your child like his own? And you married this guy?! How do you build a life with someone who would look at taking care of his step child as babysitting?!", "He doesn't get to marry you and then pretend that child isn't his kid. You're TA if you're cool with him not parenting your children just because the kid is from a previous marriage. I assume he's been there through *at least* half this child's life as they're only 4 years old and you have a 10 month old with your husband.\n\nIt's not babysitting, it's parenting. He needs to step up as a Dad and husband, give you time to yourself and take care of the kids.", "Ugh. Hope you can get him to see the light. You must be burnt out doing it all at home and working. He needs to understand that your current life is not the life of his childhood and that\u2019s ok, but he needs to give up the fantasy that he gets to check out as soon as he gets home from work simply because he has a penis. You\u2019re a team and you both need to share the load, mental and physical. Right now you\u2019re wiped and have no more to give. Tell him you are going to take that $500 and have a weekend away alone to rest and when you get back you\u2019re going to have a serious conversation about how you both are going to divide up the responsibilities so as to prevent future burn out. If he\u2019s not willing I\u2019d be seriously considering separation because that would lighten your load significantly. Good luck!", "It's sounds like no matter what you've said you're still taking care of all the traditional duties but also working full time. How in the world did he hear the officiant speak at your wedding to say I do? Did he just show up at the right time on accident? He has a job so he hears them just fine, it's just you speaking a foreign language apparently.", "Generally speaking if he doesn't bake and can not follow directions very well, which he can't since you gave him directions that he actively ignored ,and I'm sure he tasted as he went, and admitted it's probably going to be the worst cake you ever tasted. It's probably going to be the worst cake you ever tasted, and he knew that before he ever tried to give it to you.", "I like \"maroon\" - now going to use that when referring to \"I-di-ots\" \ud83d\ude06", "He calls our home decor/architecture Acadian! Lol I had no idea what that was or where it came from. I am not from Louisiana but I see that word everywhere. I also can pronounce nothing here !", "Lol I live in Canada as well. I was able to read and understand most of your french. I don't speak it at all though haha.", "That\u2019s cool! Although I can\u2019t help but imagine stereotypical old timey cottage core haha! But there you go, Op! Acadia was an old settlement that some of us descended from it will happily talk about 400 years later lol. To my understanding, Cajun is Acadian and \u201cIndian\u201d (dang you, Columbus) combined. I could definitely imagine you see it often. \n\nAww if it makes you feel better OP i would likely say nothing right there either. The accents are totally different, even in English. I mainly only speak French high pitched with an apparently similar accent to French immersion kids in my area but with an overemphasis on questions. It took me years to figure out my mom would say ouais and it was a different word than oui (but with the same general meaning). I can only imagine they would understand me but think I talk funny French.", "Aww heck yeah!! That is really good validation for me, i love that! Thank you so much!!"]}
