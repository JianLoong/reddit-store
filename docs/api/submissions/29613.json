Sure he doesn\u2019t have the same role as a bio father, assuming he\u2019s still in her life, but he is a secondary parent and he should never think of watching her as being any different than watching his own bio child.

Uh... what? He shouldn't be \"babysitting\" his own kids, that's just called parenting.

I can\u2019t be the only one doing childcare/housework. It can\u2019t be \u201ctraditional\u201d and I work lol.

We were told in school they had kids with the local First Nations and bam Cajuns. \n\nSo fun fact for you today, OP! One of your husband\u2019s ancestors lived in the same early settlement my ancestor did.

You\u2019re a team and you both need to share the load, mental and physical. Right now you\u2019re wiped and have no more to give. Tell him you are going to take that $500 and have a weekend away alone to rest and when you get back you\u2019re going to have a serious conversation about how you both are going to divide up the responsibilities so as to prevent future burn out.

To my understanding, Cajun is Acadian and \u201cIndian\u201d (dang you, Columbus) combined. I could definitely imagine you see it often. \n\nAww if it makes you feel better OP i would likely say nothing right there either. The accents are totally different, even in English. I mainly only speak French high pitched with an apparently similar accent to French immersion kids in my area but with an overemphasis on questions. It took me years to figure out my mom would say ouais and it was a different word than oui (but with the same general meaning).
