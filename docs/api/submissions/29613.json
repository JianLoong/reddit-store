Sure he doesn\u2019t have the same role as a bio father, assuming he\u2019s still in her life, but he is a secondary parent and he should never think of watching her as being any different than watching his own bio child.

Uh... what? He shouldn't be \"babysitting\" his own kids, that's just called parenting.

One of your husband\u2019s ancestors lived in the same early settlement my ancestor did.

You\u2019re a team and you both need to share the load, mental and physical. Right now you\u2019re wiped and have no more to give. Tell him you are going to take that $500 and have a weekend away alone to rest and when you get back you\u2019re going to have a serious conversation about how you both are going to divide up the responsibilities so as to prevent future burn out.

To my understanding, Cajun is Acadian and \u201cIndian\u201d (dang you, Columbus) combined. I could definitely imagine you see it often. \n\nAww if it makes you feel better OP i would likely say nothing right there either. The accents are totally different, even in English. I mainly only speak French high pitched with an apparently similar accent to French immersion kids in my area but with an overemphasis on questions. It took me years to figure out my mom would say ouais and it was a different word than oui (but with the same general meaning).

Then ask him how you can prepare him to look after the kids by himself, since it sounds like he hasn\u2019t done that on his own yet. Let him make you the cake, let him do the gift thing. It\u2019s how he shows his affections. If he ever asks about something intended as a gift and it\u2019s not your thing, try \u201cI was thinking maybe this instead\u201d or \u201chow about we put that money towards a mini getaway or date night.\u201d If he insists on a gift, tell him maybe you two will make a wish list, be it on paper, Amazon, etc. This helps everyone get what they want. Fulfills his gift giving love language and you get what you actually will use and vice versa. Communication is going to play a huge role on the outcome of this situation. Just remember to approach every struggle with empathy, kindness and with an open mind.", "But she did communicate with him. She told him she\u2019d prefer some down time instead of a cake. How much more direct could she have possibly been?", "Haha your insult got modded.", "Or maybe he just likes the cake he made and wanted to share it. Wow, victim complex much.", "No he had 50/50 custody of his kids until they started school. He was raising them alone every other week and doing fine before me. He\u2019s in the army so he can\u2019t move to be near them during the school year right now unfortunately. He\u2019s very hands on with the boys I think he does less with the girls because I\u2019m his wife and their mom idk. He definitely lets me do all the laundry/cleaning/cooking for the boys now that we are together but he is very involved in entertaining them while we have them.", "Definitely isn\u2019t babysitting and there\u2019s no excuse for it!! If he can\u2019t watch a child for maybe 4 hours what are you going to do for the years that it takes for these kids to be able to watch themselves\u2026 You deserve a little bit of time to yourself, no matter what it is. You will loose sanity if you don\u2019t get to be by yourself and do something other than when you\u2019re working.\nMy boyfriend(29) isn\u2019t the father of my 4 year old daughter and I\u2019m pregnant with his first child. Anytime I need him to watch my daughter he instantly does it no questions asked. I always double check to make sure he\u2019s okay with it but no questions asked he\u2019s always there for my child. Please stop making excuses for his behaviour you deserve 100%", "The communication after the mess up is the part I was referring to. Yes she did say what she wanted but in his mind what he gave her instead was better. Now he is in the huff because he made a cake and she's an unappreciative b***. He cannot see he dropped the ball because he had and idea and run with it instead of sticking to \"the brief\". It takes a lot of patience to explain it calmly and allow him to see her point that whilst he means well this is not what she needed and most of all explain how it made her feel because he is clueless why she's upset and angry. This cannot be achieved whilst her feeling of frustrating and frankly betrayal (because I'm sure she feels that way I know I would) is still raw. Telling him \"you're wrong\" won't fix it. If you give him time to see her side he will see her point and not want to make that mistake again (assuming  he loves and cares about her). Otherwise he will just retreat to \"no-one understands or appreciates me\" territory. They will both keep growing more resentful and eventually reach the point where divorce is the only option.\nOf course if the assumption he cares about OP is wrong and he is in fact a selfish prick then he won't see how he's wrong in this particular situation.  If that's the case all OP can do is pack her bags and leave. \nBut I'm sure OP loves her husband and would rather give him benefit of the doubt and give him the understanding he needs to get better than throw in the towel and walk away. That's the last resort solution people in this sub like to throw in way too soon.", "If he was in college that means he has had 10 to 15 years to figure his shit out", ">He definitely lets me do all the laundry/cleaning/cooking for the boys now that we are together\n\nHow thoughtful of him that he \"lets\" you do that.

But his perspective doesn't stand up to any questioning. \n\nHe's traditional but he isnt willing to work hard enough so you can stay home with a small infant. Letting your wife stay at home and raise the kid is pretty much the most basic \"traditional\" value.\n\nHe's a good stepparent but also he isnt, you are scared to ask him to help with your kid, so you justify it as well she has a Facetime father.\n\nHe cant afford his child support and the standards of living you want so you have to work. That means he cant pay his child support and living expenses without your help.", "Sure, if you reach the point where, as a married couple, you can't sit down and have a conversation about how you're feeling, the marriage is pretty much over. I'm just stunned that he didn't know what she wanted as she couldn't have been more clear about her desires:\n\n>\u201cyou know what is like instead of a cake? Some alone time from the kids.\u201d \n\nIf you hear that, and then continue to make the cake instead of giving your wife alone time without the kids, then you're just flat out ignoring her.

As to the point of not dropping the cake once you hear \"I don't want it\" - if you're hyperfocused ADHD stopping is not an option. We don't know if OP's husband actually had ADHD but if he does then it's to be expected. You just have to try minimise your losses and try to get ahead of next episode like that. It takes a lot of self restraint for someone with ADHD to not start something unless you know that you can/have time to finish it. Also time blindness is an issue so when you think \"I'll quickly finish this and then it won't be a problem\" 4 hrs later you're still at it. People with time blindness don't understand that when they think \"it will take 2min\" it will actually take 2hrs. \nHe is obviously oblivious to that as well as wife's feelings so I agree that the point of how wife ended up being ignored on her birthday would need to be discussed.", "He got out of the military, went to college at the age of 30, had a GF for 3 months (how old was she?) and got her pregnant? Does this guy even know about birth control? Is he responsible in any way whatsoever?", ">if you're hyperfocused ADHD stopping is not an option. \n\nThat's an overgeneralization, not everyone with ADHD deals with things the same way. But regardless, we certainly agree that, if they're going to have a successful marriage, they should talk about what happened.

He was already knee deep in cake at that point. He seemed sincerely trying to please you with that. Some partners need to be told very specifically what you need. I have found this out to be true in my life anyway. So maybe instead of it being a big fight you could say listen, thank you for the cake but what I really need is for you on this day to take the kids for this amount of time so I can be alone. Sometimes they need it spelled out and sometimes they need it written out and sometimes they need a freaking picture drawn so they know what exactly what you mean.
