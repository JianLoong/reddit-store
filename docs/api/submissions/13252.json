I begged my husband not to invite one male from his friend's group, a coworker who we'll name Freddie (28M) for one specific reason of which you'll find below. He nods in agreement. I, on the other hand, invited as many people as I could and only adults were allowed--especially because there was alcohol present. This event occurred yesterday from 3:30 - 7:15 P.M. Short and sweet. \n\nThe rules were simple and strictly enforced, they were also communicated via email to all invited guests beforehand. It was a potluck, so each guest or group had to bring one food item that could be shared with everyone. These dishes were placed on the kitchen counter next to the food myself and my husband had already prepared. I asked that those who attended did NOT bring their kids. I also asked for people to be on their best behavior and avoid entering areas of the house (master bedroom, attic...) that were off limits, either because they were unfinished and dangerous or very personal. \n\nTypical house party rules. \n\nBesides the above, the party was in no way formal and was meant to be enjoyed through communication, games, and/or watching TV. I turned away only a few guests that refused to bring food to our house party or 'claimed they did not know.' I also turned away one woman who brought along her child, and even she did not seem to understand that I did not want children present for the adult conversations transpiring (drugs, other) and music playing as well as the alcoholic beverages. \n\nFlash forward to the coworker I asked my husband not to invite. When Freddie showed up I downright denied him entry. I could smell him from the doorway the same as any other time he barges in on the weekends. He is an avid conspiracy theorist and collector. He and my husband hit it off instantly for their love of Star Wars and DnD. Freddie, for reasons unknown, also always smells unhygienic to the point where it is concerning. When I finally mustered the courage to ask him about the smell days ago, he tells me that it's some paint from inside his car--despite this being a month now of smelling off.\n\nMy husband drifted beside me while I continued to voice my concerns. Freddie tells my husband about what I've said to him, and my husband shoots me the most disapproving look I've seen all marriage. Eventually, I am forced to let Freddie in because Freddie brought food, a couple of games, some gifts (unnecessary, but oh well) and he's my husband's close friend. Husband pokes that Freddie has abided by \"my\" rules and has done nothing wrong--while I uphold that the need to have demonstrated basic, personal hygiene shouldn't have to be required in writing on the email I sent out.

She said they both spent the whole party in her bedroom with the door closed.", "My mentioning about Freddie's uncleanliness managed to send the party into concern. A few spectators moved from place to place, never crossing paths. My husband does not have very many friends, Freddie being one of them, and him spending time alone with Freddie so that Freddie is not 'bullied' or 'outed' by any of our guests is entirely him. \n\nMaybe it is his way of protecting Freddie.

Look, it\u2019s annoying when people show up that don\u2019t bring something to share. And it\u2019s annoying when people bring kids when you didn\u2019t invite them, but I can\u2019t imagine as someone who hosts gatherings regularly telling those people to leave. Depending on the situation, I generally just don\u2019t invite those folks again. Your husband\u2019s friend sounds like someone I wouldn\u2019t enjoy either, but it\u2019s likely your husband invited him, and it\u2019s incredibly rude to turn people away. YTA, OP.", "YTA for a few reasons\n\n1.  Your husband likes freddie, despite his flaws.  It's his party too, let him bring his friend.  You can just avoid freddie.  He probably dislikes some of your friends too, but he keeps his mouth shut.\n2. You're turning away people at the door for not bringing a dish? That's just weird.

It's an explicitly stated adult only party, even if they were allowed to stay what was that kid going to even do?

I guess it just depends on how bad/intense the supposed smell actually is. If it's just a weird smell or you only notice it if you are in each other's personal space then whatever, but if it's a really strong smell or BO and you can smell it from a few feet away then that's just gross. I for one would hate to have to be in an enclosed space (or be forced to leave the room) just because some dude refuses to shower.

I always plan my parties to end earlier than when I must divert my attention to another cause. If I were to set a time for 9 P.M., I would expect the attendees to have deserted before 11 P.M.", "9 P.M. is better for me. The time is only so that the partygoers will certainly have deserted before my 9 P.M. bedtime.", "A party that obscene would not mesh well with the furniture. I do love my couch.", "The fact that there is a ratio at all is the problem. Sounds like HS bs.", "Ok. I see. You know, I find this very strange. I would never invite randoms to my house. Maybe it's a thing in your area. In my city that would be a very bad idea. And, like, how do you control who gets your email address and home address? \n\nSeems kinda risky to me. \n\n..but now I understand the turning people away policy. Makes sense.", "So you didn't have a party with \"friends\" you basically sent out open invitations over email to strangers, and the one person your husband knew wasn't allowed in.", "I can only assume that you\u2019ve been victim to a typo, but oh what a typo it was!", "Is English your first language?", "You sound defensive, snobby, and mean cloaked in frilly language, all at once", "They do. I only invited close friends, family members, and my favorite coworkers. It is okay if you do not attend, you are entitled to your activities.", "I was married officially last year. We were fianc\u00e9's for a while though. I believe I was 19.", "He doesn't intend to be. He takes himself too seriously.", "They mean you're using weird words for no apparent reason. Why utilizing rather than using? It's like you're trying to sound smart but sound like a robot/recently arrived alien instead. Is it something you do because you think it makes you sound mature and smart to your husband who's had almost an extra decade to learn words?", "No. They are having sex.\n\nSilly goose", "Might want to prepare yourself for your husband leaving you and your boring school assemblies (sorry, sorry ....parties) for Freddie. If he start decorating a room in the house for him, you may as well just move out. You've been replaced.", "This thing you\u2019re doing where you pretend to not understand any of the poo culture references is not doing you any favors. I really don\u2019t watch a lot of tv (<1 hr a week) but I still know who Sheldon cooper is and what an insta party is. \n\nAnd stop trying to sound pretentious. Your sentence structure is\u2026 unusual\u2026 to the point it makes no sense and half of the time it reads as if you used a thesaurus incorrectly. \n\nAs one \u201cfast forwards\u201d. Not \u201cflash forwards\u201d", "I doubt she has more than 4 or 5 people who routinely come to her events, and I'm sure they are all as much fun as she is.", "I do have friends to invite, and they were here for the party same as they have been for my other such plans. They are very supportive and kind. I would not have it any other way.", "So she's basically turning away her husband's guest.", "Absolutely false. They lie to themselves that they do, but they're so new to justified guilt that a pg13 movie is inappropriate for kids", "You said members?!? Are you running a sex club from your home?", "You are 22, partner older.\n\nLikely, it\u2019s a family party & weren\u2019t having your petulant behavior \u2026 be mess & so it is", "Good point. Maybe a tarp to cover the furniture? I know, I know it looks tacky but you can cover the tarp with a stylish blanket or a quilt. Just spitballing here.", "She sounds like a kid trying to fit in with the grownups.\n\nYTA OP, and a terrible host.", "Knowing the word 'pretentious,' I do not find it necessary to impress my guests with such offhand reflections of higher standards; however, I do believe in upholding rules as a general consensus of a safe and manageable party within a personal environment. According to another user, I am also not mature at 22. I would assume you are of the same mind as well.", "Sweetie, they spent the entire \u201cparty\u201d alone in your bedroom.", "I assure you that I am not pretending. I do not know what any of those references mean. I only found out today who Sheldon Cooper is supposed to be but I do not watch TV. I have never watched TV, and I do not find the concept hard at all to understand. I also do not own Instagram. I know it as an app and media platform. I do not know what an 'Instagram party' may be. As an aside, a flashforward is from a narrator's standpoint as a flash toward the future or timeskip ahead, if you would, it is similar to a flashback only forward. It is a word. I know it to be.", "Flash forward is a thing", "> rules remain rules\n\nOP, this is the mindset that a lot of posters have. Rules, being honest, and being right are separate from being an AH. You can follow all the rules and still be an AH. So, while turning people away at the door for not following rules is fair and just, it is still an AH thing to do. \n\nYou wanted to know if you were an AH, which you were. Were you \u201cjustified\u201d in some of your behaviors like turning people away from the door and not inviting a \u201csmelly\u201d person? Also yes. Still and AH.", "You 100% meant to be offensive idk why you're lying. It's reddit, no ones going to get you.", "I do not believe my mental health would need to be discussed over the choice of a house party. If I am on this spectrum, I remain unsure.", "This sub is for casting righteous condemnation, if you post, people will respond. You sound like you are filtering your sentences through a thesaurus, so the wording comes off pretentious. You are correct as well, my explanation could be seen as pretentious.", "The event comes as no surprise to me. My husband likes spending time with Freddie; but I doubt he would be interested in such uncleanliness. He does keep himself very well managed. If he did not, we would never have married.", "I was chalking this up to English not being her first language.", "I suppose you might be bothered to understand what I mean or possibly draw strings to understand. Both work, of course.", "I really didn't, youre reading into it.", "I'd suggest going to a therapist/psychiatrist if you have the option to. It could greatly increase your quality of life if you are on the spectrum.", "Autism isn't a mental illness", "Agreed. Seems like we\u2019re chatting with a robot. Who speaks like this?!", "Girl.... you are so young and naive. You would be aghast at what some people are into. \ud83d\ude29", "Letting people consume alcohol and drugs at a party on your property and then them driving after does not seem safe.", "Same. That's the only way a lot of this makes sense to me.", "You think your party seemed fun lmao. I think you'll see a drastic drop in your RSVP future", "I guess your party was fun DESPITE you and your behaviour then, hopefully everyone else mingled well enough to look over your appalling actions (turning people away at the door!!?)", "A 22 year old dating someone a decade older operating under delusions that she's hosting a gala", "I doubt so, considering I had very many returnees this time around in both family and friends. Most of the coworkers were new considering the move, but I am happy that many of them enjoyed my hosting. I have hosted three parties in my lifetime. My mother hosted our wedding party and a wonderful gala sometime after that a year ago."]}
