I begged my husband not to invite one male from his friend's group, a coworker who we'll name Freddie (28M) for one specific reason of which you'll find below. He nods in agreement. I, on the other hand, invited as many people as I could and only adults were allowed--especially because there was alcohol present. This event occurred yesterday from 3:30 - 7:15 P.M. Short and sweet. \n\nThe rules were simple and strictly enforced, they were also communicated via email to all invited guests beforehand. It was a potluck, so each guest or group had to bring one food item that could be shared with everyone. These dishes were placed on the kitchen counter next to the food myself and my husband had already prepared. I asked that those who attended did NOT bring their kids. I also asked for people to be on their best behavior and avoid entering areas of the house (master bedroom, attic...) that were off limits, either because they were unfinished and dangerous or very personal. \n\nTypical house party rules. \n\nBesides the above, the party was in no way formal and was meant to be enjoyed through communication, games, and/or watching TV. I turned away only a few guests that refused to bring food to our house party or 'claimed they did not know.' I also turned away one woman who brought along her child, and even she did not seem to understand that I did not want children present for the adult conversations transpiring (drugs, other) and music playing as well as the alcoholic beverages. \n\nFlash forward to the coworker I asked my husband not to invite. When Freddie showed up I downright denied him entry. I could smell him from the doorway the same as any other time he barges in on the weekends. He is an avid conspiracy theorist and collector. He and my husband hit it off instantly for their love of Star Wars and DnD. Freddie, for reasons unknown, also always smells unhygienic to the point where it is concerning. When I finally mustered the courage to ask him about the smell days ago, he tells me that it's some paint from inside his car--despite this being a month now of smelling off.\n\nMy husband drifted beside me while I continued to voice my concerns. Freddie tells my husband about what I've said to him, and my husband shoots me the most disapproving look I've seen all marriage. Eventually, I am forced to let Freddie in because Freddie brought food, a couple of games, some gifts (unnecessary, but oh well) and he's my husband's close friend. Husband pokes that Freddie has abided by \"my\" rules and has done nothing wrong--while I uphold that the need to have demonstrated basic, personal hygiene shouldn't have to be required in writing on the email I sent out.
