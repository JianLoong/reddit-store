I know your husband is in a tough spot but backing out at the last minute isn\u2019t fair to everyone else. It may be that in the future, you may need to compromise about Christmas, but if the compromise this year is him spending Christmas with his mom while the rest of you are in Hawaii \u2014 due to his last minute decision \u2014then both of you need to accept it and move on. \n\nThat said, YWBTA if you don\u2019t seriously consider compromising on how you spend Christmas in the future. People\u2019s lives change and your husband and his family may have different needs in the future, and you can\u2019t insist on getting your way every time.  I can\u2019t tell whether he asked earlier or if you just railroaded through on the Hawaii Christmas this year. But failing to understand the grief they are suffering would show a real lack of empathy.", "It\u2019s not just your mil still grieving, it\u2019s your husband. For some, the year after the person dies can be just as difficult. A lot of people will remember and reach out during that first year and then after move on, which is natural but the person that experienced the loss , is in a different place.\n\nYou\u2019re reaction oh, we canceled last year for the funeral, so we\u2019ve done our time with husbands family, isn\u2019t in line with what your husband is feeling/thinking.\n\nDid you really talk with him and ask him how he is doing? Ask him if he wanted to spend more time with his family or did you just assume, time to move on?\n\nDid you bring up maybe bringing MIL this year? \n\nI think your husband was maybe second guessing this trip sooner and might not have had the words.\n\nNAH because of the timing that the husband spoke up. But I wonder if he said something 3 months ago if you would have heard him and changed plans. \nJust because something has been done for years, doesn\u2019t mean it needs or continue as circumstances change.", "I think NTA because you stayed home the first year after his Dad passed away and you had agreed to the Thanksgiving/Christmas arrangement for this year.  He changed his mind after all the arrangements were made.\n\nHowever, I think you and your husband need to talk about this more.  Where are he and his Mom in their grieving processes?  How does he envision things working in future years?  Does he want every Christmas with his Mom now?  Does he want to do alternate Christmases? Or is this year just particularly hard for both of them? \n\nAlso, is there an option to have your MIL join you in Hawaii since she\u2019s on her own?", "NAH\n\nI understand both sides. Loosing someone close to Christmas sucks (I lost my cat recently, my dog died several years ago between Christmas and new year and a relative died 15 minutes into 2021). It is tough but you want to be with your family as well.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "Couldn't his mother have come with you? A change of scenary over the holidays could have done her good. Traditions DO change when someone dies. Due to my grandmother's illness they were always home over the holidays but when she had passed grandfather travelled to us every year.", "Info: why not just bring mom to hawaii?", "NAH\n\nI feel for your husband, he lost his Dad a year ago and his Mom is spending Christmas without her partner. \n\nWith plane tickets bought and hotels arranged - a week out is not enough time to change plans. I agree with you about not wanting to cancel and taking the kids to see your family. \n\nI do think you need to cut him some slack here though - the holidays can be really hard for people who have lost loved ones recently. I think you're all doing your best in this situation and I don't think there is any right answer here. Hopefully, your husband can join you next year, and maybe you could have a conversation about that when you get back.", "Bring his mom to Hawaii next year.", "NTA. It may be years before husband and his mom and family will be in a better place. I know it was for me, but I didn\u2019t change my children\u2019s lives except that first year. Life does go on. Husband and his mom need grief counseling.", "Hes grieving for his dad. Hes spending time with his mom, whos also grieving his dad, her husband. \n\nMyabe its a bit sucky of him to drop out of the vacay last minute, but also, its the first anniversary of his dads death.\n\nIdk. Hes not an asshole for grieving his dad. If he did this next year, then ya, hed be a jerk. \n\nYou arent really an asshole either, but I think it might be good to remember that hes grieving, even if he doesnt show it. \n\nIdk. NAH.", "NTA. While I understand that your husband wants to stay home & be with his mom--you had worked out a plan to all go with your family.\n\n  I'm not going to call anyone an AH in this scenario. He's obvs still grieving, as is his mom, and so he's now decided to stay home with her. Understandable.\n\n   But\\~I don't think it's right for him to expect you and the kids to stay home AFTER you agreed that you'd all go, after your parents paid for it, and *at the last minute.* \n\nTBH, I'd say drop the rope and know that you can't fix this until you are home\\~and perhaps go to a counselor together.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted for this, but NTA. If he had suggested 6 months ago - before the trip was planned and paid for - that you spend Christmas with his mom and adjusted the family holiday/Christmas schedule accordingly, then that would be different. But he waited until one week before, after you\u2019d already spent Thanksgiving with her and the whole trip was paid for, to suggest canceling your side of the family\u2019s holiday and do Christmas with her as well. \n\nI completely understand that he\u2019s grieving, but pushing through it a bit to support your family and honor the people you have left is just a reality of long term grief. There are no guarantees in life. What if one of OP\u2019s parents isn\u2019t still here next Christmas and they missed their last opportunity for this special week?\n\nBottom line: I understand and commiserate with his feelings, but I think casually expecting his whole family to cancel an amazing trip that was already paid for was unreasonable given the time frame, and at the very least, he shouldn\u2019t punish you for still going when he didn\u2019t.", "NTA: Everyone grieves differently, so he might still be hurting since he lost his father at this time of the year.\n\nThat being said, you both agreed to go to Hawaii for Christmas this year. Your father paid for your tickets and hotel (which is a huge wow!). To not go wouldn't be fair to your children who are looking forward to the trip and to your dad who put out a ton of money for the trip.\n\nBe kind to your hubs though and really talk about next year's plans. Christmas may never be the same for him again.", "Just to be clear, you\u2019re in Hawaii with your parents? Your family lives there? This isn\u2019t just a vacay? It\u2019s family time?", "Ok , for putting a time limit and judging your husband and MIL to limit their grieving process you\u2019re the AH. For going without him you\u2019re NTA. People grieve in their own time and in their own way. You have no right to set limits on that. Think about it.", "NAH he\u2019s grieving, but things were already paid for and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person for wanting to enjoy your families holiday tradition.", "NAH\n\nyour husband is grieving in not the most healthy way. You are on a vacation that was planned for a long time, to cancel last minute doesnt seem right. His time to disagree was when the plans were being made, not at the 11th hour. But Im sympathetic to him since grief does make people irrational.", "NTA. He's an adult -- you both agreed on a plan, and him backtracking on the plan isn't fair to you or your family. If he didn't think it was a good plan he had ample time to discuss with you.  \n\n\nI'm sympathetic to the fact the his mother doesn't have her husband any more. But does that mean you're never going to spend Christmas with your family from now on? Married life is about compromise, and your husband's priorities can't be singularly places with him mother any longer.", "I'm going with NTA. I understand he is still grieving, and so is his mom. What I don't agree with is changing his mind a week out from the trip that's already paid for and then getting mad that you didn't change plans with him. \n\nDo you know if his mom has expressed that she wants him to stay home for Christmas? If she did, why didn't he bring this up much sooner?", "NTA \u2026. If it was last year, you would be. He wants this to be your new tradition. Personally, I don\u2019t need to celebrate on a day, Christmas can be a family day whenever you get together with family", "NTA I understand that people think that you shouldn't feel like he's already over it if he wants to mourn but I think they are missing that there was an agreed upon plan in place for a while and just before the plan was enacted he backed out. Sure he might not have been over it but maybe he needed to be better at communicating that in a timely fashion rather than waiting?  He's your husband not your child and I don't see how you have to be expected to predict how he's feeling without him verbalizing it.  I can understand how he thinks his mom might need company but since he also has his own family to consider I think there should have been more discussion on his part about what he wanted or expected, especially with having pre-made plans and agreements.  Again you are not a mind reader and I don't think it'd especially fair to you and the kids for him to ask you guys to stay back after agreeing to go and going along with it all the while unless some other compromise had been formed since this plan was the result of the initial compromise of Thanksgiving with his side and Xmas with yours.  I think its a really emotionally charged situation that needs more communication but I wouldn't say anyone is TA unless one party gets mad at the other for something that was never communicated.", "YTA for your attitude *\"I* wasn't going to forgo *my* family's Christmas tradition and seeing *my* family *just for his mom\"* (italics added).  \n\nObviously his mom is important to him.  I get that you have to move on but grief is different for everyone.  This is the loss of her life partner.  You have put your tradition above your family which IMHO really sucks.", "Mixed feelings here... N T A because you BOTH agreed to this early in the year. And hubs decided last minute to back out...\n\nBut YTA aswell for feeling this way. My aunt died in 2005 on Thanksgiving night. These holidays are still hard for me and my family. She was like a 2nd mom to me. Grief isn't set in stone. After it had happened. It was easy for him to say 'yeah thats fine!\"\nBut now that the holiday time is here... and with winter depression already a thing... yeah I get that he wants to be home with his mom. \nAlso the part where you said 'me and the kids missed out last year'. That makes you sound like an 'A' because how I read it, is that his dad's death was a huge inconvenience because you didn't get to do what you wanted. \n\nI understand the plane tickets. Should get refundable tickets. But overall I'd have to say YTA", "NTA backing out a week before after your dad already paid is rude, I understand he\u2019s concerned about his mom but there was a plan in place. Now your kids aren\u2019t with their dad on Christmas so what benefit is that?!", "YTA\n\nThe first anniversary of a loved one dying is really hard and people react in different ways. He probably saw that his mother wasn't doing good in that time and wanted to be with her, and he probably needed you to support him as well. \n\nFamily tradition is important, and so is vacationing, but supporting your husband and your MIL is more important, especially during hardships like this. You could have traveled to see your family any other time. \n\nHe probably should have foreseen this, but sometimes you just can't.", "NTA. He is mourning and your family tradition is very important to you. Both of those things are completely valid. \n\nHe is more of the AH in this scenario because there is a lot of money wasted with a last minute back out like that.", "YTA. I\u2019m honestly shocked that you guys would even plan for Hawaii this year. How much of that was his idea and not just your urging? \n\nHe didn\u2019t lose his dad months before Christmas last year. He basically lost and laid him to rest DURING Christmas. And it didn\u2019t occur that this year may be hard for him and his mother? That he might not be in that aloha spirit? That his mom might not want her son and grand babies to be gone while she mourns her husband? \n\nYou do Hawaii every year. This is FIRST (I don\u2019t care how hard you argue that it\u2019s his second and imply he should be fine) holiday season without his dad. It\u2019s the anniversary of his dad dying. \n\nYou were wrong for even booking the tickets and not saying \u201chey honey, this could be a tough one, let\u2019s just spend Christmas at home with your mom and maybe we can all do Hawaii next year.\u201d", "YTA\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, you sound like you suck.\n\nYour husband is very clearly depressed. This is his first Christmas without his dad and you are supposed to be part of his support system. Yeah it sucks but sometimes you make sacrifices for the people you love. That may include cancelling the Hawaii trip. \n\nHave some empathy. When your dad croaks do you think he\u2019ll leave you alone to deal with it yourself?", "Probably not the popular opinion but NTA. Life moves forward. I understand it\u2019s hard as fuck, but you can\u2019t stay dwelling on bad things that have happened and stall everyone around you as well. If he wants to mourn for the holidays, he is free to, but you don\u2019t have to stay with him and mourn too. You made a plan, it was already paid for and hyped up to the kids, it\u2019s okay that you went.", "ESH. You act like he should have gotten over this already and he has a reason to be upset with you and want to talk to his kids. However, he should have talked about it with you before your dad paid for everything.", "NTA.\n\nI would have said No Assholes Here, but since your husband is treating you poorly, and the fact that you just saw the MIL and will see her again once you get back, I say NTA. You made agreed-upon plans with him and then he decided to stay home, wasting the money your father spent on him. I get your husband being sad and wanting to spend time with his mother, but not after already agreeing to these plans in advance. Him wanting to stay home is one thing, but to then act as if he's mad/sad about it, which seems like he's doing to make you feel guilty, is completely unacceptable. I personally couldn't imagine willingly being away from my wife and kids on Christmas, while simultaneously seating her with the brunt of having to watch the kids alone, even if I was in the same situation.", "YTA Grief is a long, messy, complicated thing. It tends to flare up, especially around anniversaries of tragedy, which you said this was. Your husband may have said he needed to be with his mom\u2026but he really needed you, his partner, to be there\u2026to support him and validate his emotional needs. But you, frankly, made selfish choices. You say he was upset that you weren\u2019t going to forego your family\u2019s tradition and seeing your family. I think you\u2019re missing the fact that YOUR family, is at its core, you, your husband, and children. You did forego your family by allowing it to be separated at Christmas over not respecting your mourning husband\u2019s grief. If it was me, and my wife emotionally abandoned me like that, I would be seriously considering divorce.", "NTA. You can't cancel an all expenses paid vacation 1 week before.  Seriously? That would be so incredibly rude. Op agreed to a compromise. How is she the AH for expecting that compromise to be fulfilled? Death is awful and grief is intense.  But her husband has known for a full year Christmas in Hawaii.  \n\nI sympathize with MIL and OPs husband.  I also experienced the death of my newborn son a week before Christmas. You carry the grief in your heart forever. :( But it's still Christmas. You have to move forward. I can't expect my extended family to not celebrate during the time of year when schools are closed and families have vacation time.", "Soft YTA. It's hard to judge you because I can understand your argument. But it's clear that your husband is still not over his dead passing away and he needed his family around him at this time of the year. He thought he's ok so he went ahead with planning this trip, but as the holiday approached, he realized he's not ok. Quite likely he has at least a minor depression. And now he feels kinda betrayed, because you chose your and your kids vacation over staying to support him. Your vacation will be over but you might have to work for quite a while to repair this rift. Well, at least he has his mom to lean on, so he's not fully alone.", "YTA\n\nAfter easing your responses you seem to lack all empathy here. It\u2019s the anniversary of your FIL dying of course this time of year is hard for your husband and his mom and he would want to be there to support her.

You still kept going to Hawaii every year, it was your husband's parents who change their Christmas celebration to New Year. \nObviously husband shouldn't have waited till after the tickets were bought before voicing his concerns but it really doesn't sound like it would have made a difference. You make it sound like your father's in law passing away last year was just an inconvenience that kept you from going to your trip and your failing to show your husband any empathy, you're just thinking about yourself", "YTA.

Your husband lost his father at a very difficult time and while yes earlier on he said the Hawaii trip was fine, grief pops up atthe most random of times and as the holiday got closer, I'm sure he felt it come on e en more and changed his mind.

I'm sorry that the plane and hotel were already booked and it sucks but it sounds like your husband needed support and to be around his mom and  wife and kids during this difficult time.

This is a sucky situation and you do deserve to see your family too but grief is not a straight path and there are ebbs and flows to it.

However, OP and their kids aren\u2019t wrong for wanting to continue a holiday tradition that includes happy family memories.

Plus, it would not have worked out well to tell their kids that the fun Hawaiian vacation they were looking forward to is now being scrapped so they can sit in a house of mourning with their dad and grandma. \n\nGoing forward they should discuss if he wants to change the arrangement to every other year with her family and the next year with his. HOWEVER, if this is the new plan then I think husband and MIL have a responsibility to find a way to make the Christmas celebration a happy one celebrating life, and not a time to just sit and mourn together. They could even make new traditions of having the kids make a Christmas card to put on grandpas grave, visit for a bit and then the family do something uplifting.

It doesn\u2019t seem like this is their only chance to see her dad or celebrate with him.", "If he really wanted to make sure his mom wasn\u2019t alone.

And the husband agreed in that beforehand discussion that the arrangement would be that they go to hawaii", "For me where he becomes TA is that he left it so late and just expects all the plans to be upended for him. It\u2019s fine for him to stay home, not fine for him to be angry at OP for still going.", "Even if you discuss it beforehand, things change. Maybe husband is listening to his mom meltdown on the phone and realized she needs family around her. The first Christmas everyone is in shock after a death. The second one it hits home.", "Also, OP said they spend EVERY year in Hawaii with her family. He NEVER got to spend Christmas with his family until his dad died.

Grief doesn't have a time limit, but the first anniversary and holidays are the worst and it's when the grieving party needs the most support.\n\nNext year will be a little easier on her and more understandable with leaving on the traditional trip. \n\nIf this was me, I would have spent Christmas with my husband and MIL to show my support and be there for them. \n\nOP how would you feel if you lost your dad a year ago, and your husband and kids left you behind to go on a family vacation without you for the holidays? Would you want to talk to him? I get where your husband is coming from.\n\nYou can make plans months in advance, but as time gets closer feelings can change. And your husband did because he is still grieving, and so is his mom, and he feels he needs to be there for her", "Yeah, the second year is often even harder for people because you *expect* the first year to be bad, but by the second year, everyone--often including you!--thinks you should have moved on. \n\nIt's entirely reasonable that he didn't realize how this would affect him, and that it took him by surprise. The reality is that this was going to be a tough year for him no matter what he did, and that's going to affect his spouse and kids if they care about him. What makes him TA (or not) is how he handles that, because it's also entirely reasonable for the spouse and kids to want their Christmas tradition. \n\nI can't tell from the post if anyone is actually TA at this point, or if it's just the situation that sucks. He may be keeping conversations brief because he doesn't want his sadness to spoil Christmas rather than because he's mad.

But the time to decide was when they were booking, not a week before when others had plans that depended on you and there was a lot of money on the line.\n\nHe could have decided to go directly to his mom's from Hawaii.

I am fine with the way they resolved things, but the husband is acting awful towards her despite it having been his suggestion.", "So in your world if you feel sudden emotions you are allowed to scrap all plans or previous engagements and are worth throwing away thousands of dollars, unilaterally?  And if you don't you are an Asshole?  Sorry but strongly strongly disagree.  If you actually read the OP they have been supporting her strongly throughout the whole year, it's not a sin for her to want to be with her parents for a week.  Partnerships require compromise, when you decide you can throw away plans and money on a moments it's not really a good look.", "At most, NAH", "So OP, her kids and her family all get a Christmas ruined because of his grief? No, and I say this as someone who lost a parent four years ago. That\u2019s not okay or reasonable. He also only told her a week out. Him staying and her going with the kids is the reasonable compromise.", "I'm glad I'm not the only one here thinking YTA. I'm sitting here having had a mental breakdown last night because last Christmas was the last time I saw my father alive. He passed in January this year, shortly after christmas. I understand where OP's husband is. \n\nIt's the first anniversary. Grief is comes in waves, and I'll bet it hit him very hard recently when he realized his mom was going to be alone.

I feel like hands down OP is a heartless you know what!", "I'm glad I'm not alone. I mean, yes it was kind of sucky for OPs husband to change plans last minute, but the whole lack of empathy displayed by OP really settled me on YTA", "Except he didn't say anything until a week before in spite of their previous discussion and plans. That alone changes the vote for me.   \n\n\nThis was discussed before hand and if he'd said during the planning phase that he had doubts (and then she pushed for what she wanted) then yeah I could agree with YTA. But from what OP describes, and granted we weren't in the room, it sounds like husband was fine with the plans until he wasn't which unfortunately was a week before and after everything had been paid for. So they compromised and he stayed except now he's upset with her. His grief, while understandable, doesn't get to also get to dictate the holiday for everyone else.", "Seriously. Why couldn't they have stayed home for Christmas, and gone to Hawaii for New Year's? At the very least, they should have been alternating Christmases between her family and his. And for those saying that he made that choice years ago, something tells me that as this is something that her family has always done (and don't forget that Daddy pays!), he didn't really have much choice.", "I thought I was taking crazy pills reading some of these responses. This is the first year anniversary of his father's passing and she's more focused on missing out a fancy Hawaii vacation for...oh no 2 years? A trip that can be made at any other point in the year. At best I would go for NAH because the money spent. But the lack of basic sympathy towards her husband's grief...yikes.", "She could have if they discussed it and decided on it.  They made the plans together, he changed them within the week they were leaving.  What if her dad passed this year and she missed their last holiday together?  They're not skipping out completely on his mom, they have a tradition and plan in place.

Perhaps if this decision had been made a month or 2 ago, they could have celebrated Thanksgiving with OP\u2019s family and gotten refunds on travel expenses, but the time frame here is a big deal. Also, while OP\u2019s husband is the one grieving hardest and wants to spend quality holiday time with his mom while he still has her\u2026 maybe OP wants the same thing with her family. Based on their typical travel patterns, and the fact that they couldn\u2019t go to Hawaii last year, it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s been 2+ years since she\u2019s spent either major holiday with her family.", "Don't punish the kids for their dad's grief.

Zero reason for her parents to cover the costs for OP\u2019s MIL.", "My parents would have accommodated MIL in a heartbeat. We go on family vacations like this. They would be concerned about her spending Christmas alone, and probably would have offered to cover part of her expenses/include her during the planning stages.", "He can pay for his moms ticket. Just ask in-laws if it\u2019s okay for his mom to  join them", "Would it really be rude to ask? Rude to feel entitled to it, sure.

Plane tickets no, hotel room could be figured out if the wife's family is welcoming.", "Unpopular opinion, and I'll take the downvotes.  \n\n\nI actually think it's okay that OPs family has their own tradition. Yes, marriage is a blending of two families, yadda yadda yadda. But come on -- spend a half day on this sub and it's obvious that it doesn't always work like that. OP decided she wanted to marry her husband; OPs family didn't decide that they wanted to marry OPs husband's family.

And OP said her FIL passed around this time last year, not thanksgiving, so he passed around Christmas. Meaning they probably didn\u2019t celebrate at all last year, and this is the first Christmas they\u2019re actually celebrating without him. No one could actually expect OPs MIL to be healed enough on her first Christmas without her husband to just be fine, and chances are her son doesn\u2019t want her to feel abandoned by him so soon either.

It's not required that OP's father pays for anyone who comes.", "Yeah obviously they are all adults and could just pay for his mom themselves. Which is why I'm saying why bring up this (her dad paying) as a reason for not inviting? That sounds just like an excuse and not a real reason. The real reason probably being is that they didn't want her there.", "Yes they are pretty expensive. Unless you live close to Hawaii, plane tickets for Christmas are thousands of dollars each. OP\u2019s father paid for her, the husband, and 2-3 kids. Hotels are hundreds of dollars a night there per room, and many charge extra if you have more than 2 people per room. $50k could be a stretch, but it would cost $15-20k easily. Factoring in that they missed last year (which was totally reasonable it was an unforeseen tragedy), \u201cwasting\u201d (I\u2019m using this term lightly just because these things were unrefundable) OP\u2019s fathers $15-20k two years in a row would be extremely rude.

It could be a few thousands dollars but if you go upscale it really could be tens of thousands of dollars. Obviously missing context here.", "Depends on what you're doing there and where you stay, but depending on where you live (if you're close to an international airport it's a little cheaper for flights) you can expect to pay around $1,500-$2,000 per plane ticket (so $6,000-$8,000 for all four of them), and more for add ons depending on what the airline charges. Then hotel rooms are anywhere from $250-$500 per night depending on where exactly in Hawaii you're staying (this is for basic rooms too, they get  more expensive from there), so for six nights that's $1,500-$3,000 plus all associated fees, which would probably put it closer to $2,000-$3,500 if not more. Then there's food expenses, travel expenses on the island, and so on. For a family of four, $13,000 is probably on the low end of an estimation to cover everything for a trip. Though in fairness, it would just be the hotel costs and airfair that can't be refunded, so $8,000- $11,500 would be lost depending on the exact costs. The rest of the money wouldn't have been pre-spent so it's not technically lost.\n\nThat's a lot of money to me IMHO, though it's not $50,000 lost.", "$50k is an exaggeration it but tens of thousands of dollars is plausible for a family trip to Hawaii on christmas.", "Flights. $600 pre Covid out of season from the west coast.

The first year, of course, but after that? The FIL death had meaning to OP as well and I don't blame her for having the yearning to be with her parents and siblings. Yes, it has only been a little over a year of grieving - but it has also been over a year where OP's family were less of a foucs in her and her husband's lives. It is totally understandable this was the case, but it is also totally understandable that OP was reminded of the mortality of her own parents throughout this last year as well and wants to be with them and participating in a family tradition. Yes, her husband and his mother were the primary grievers, but OP grieved as well and being the support system for people's grief is tough and often your grief and needs go completely unrecognized during the grieving process of the primary grievers.\n\nThey made the best compromise they could given the situation. It is OK to spend Christmas apart if the situation requires it. Husband and Wife have different needs for a few days. That is OK. They already have plans to celebrate on New Years as a full family and that will be lovely.\n\nI understand that Christmas is special for people, but it is special not just for OP's husband and MIL, it is special for OP, her family and her children. Family tradition is a huge comfort after a difficult year.

Instead of supporting him, she went back to a tradition that she has been doing every year of their marriage where he hasn\u2019t seen his family one single Christmas except the worst Christmas of his life, the first without his dad.  You have no sympathy if you can\u2019t see this.  Men aren\u2019t made of stone, I thought we moved past this stereotype where men are emotionless.", "No one is saying it doesn't matter. There are times when you weigh priorities. She wanted to go. It seems her upholding the tradition of going to Hawaii is paramount. His parents wanted to have Christmas with their grandchildren. But no, her tradition, so they got to celebrate Christmas on new year. She couldn't deny him last year, but it seems like she was not going to adjust her plans again. That's fine, she just shouldn't be surprised that he isn't too happy that his wife doesn't seem to get his grief. If it were one of her parents, her tune would be different.", "Are you seriously saying that when one family experiences a serious loss, is still grieving and is dealing with the emotional toll of the first Christmas without the lost dad... That that family doesn't need a little bit more support than the other side of the family?\n\nBut I have to say, they should have thought about that when they were making their plans. It seems pretty logical to me that this year would be particularly hard. How did they not foresee that?", "There\u2019s nothing that says they\u2019re close either.", "If they all stayed home like he suggested then he would be preventing his kids from spending Christmas with their other side of the family. It sounds like the conclusion for her to go was not what the husband wanted and he is punishing the wife over the phone.", "This is great dialogue really. I think what really pains me throughout the whole matter is that it blew up into an argument between OP and her husband when it never had to. Perhaps OP (and certainly myself) could have used more compassion before rushing to judgment on this matter.", "Last year was first year without dad", "His wife and kids went to Hawaii and he stayed home.\n\n\u201cIf they all stayed home like he suggested then he would be preventing his kids from spending Christmas with their other side of the family\u201d.\n\nBut that never happened meaning he never prevented them from seeing their grandparents.", "I like you. Hope you are having a great winter holiday season!", "She said he died last year around this time. Whether that was a month before or after Christmas, they were still completely in their grieving process and probably not celebrating a thing. This is the first year Christmas was actually celebrated without his dad.", "It did happen. Reread the post where he said 'we' should stay home, not him, and she said no. That was him trying to prevent the family trip.", "Same to you!"]}
