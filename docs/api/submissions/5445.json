I know your husband is in a tough spot but backing out at the last minute isn\u2019t fair to everyone else. It may be that in the future, you may need to compromise about Christmas, but if the compromise this year is him spending Christmas with his mom while the rest of you are in Hawaii \u2014 due to his last minute decision \u2014then both of you need to accept it and move on. \n\nThat said, YWBTA if you don\u2019t seriously consider compromising on how you spend Christmas in the future. People\u2019s lives change and your husband and his family may have different needs in the future, and you can\u2019t insist on getting your way every time.  I can\u2019t tell whether he asked earlier or if you just railroaded through on the Hawaii Christmas this year. But failing to understand the grief they are suffering would show a real lack of empathy.", "It\u2019s not just your mil still grieving, it\u2019s your husband. For some, the year after the person dies can be just as difficult. A lot of people will remember and reach out during that first year and then after move on, which is natural but the person that experienced the loss , is in a different place.\n\nYou\u2019re reaction oh, we canceled last year for the funeral, so we\u2019ve done our time with husbands family, isn\u2019t in line with what your husband is feeling/thinking.\n\nDid you really talk with him and ask him how he is doing? Ask him if he wanted to spend more time with his family or did you just assume, time to move on?\n\nDid you bring up maybe bringing MIL this year? \n\nI think your husband was maybe second guessing this trip sooner and might not have had the words.\n\nNAH because of the timing that the husband spoke up. But I wonder if he said something 3 months ago if you would have heard him and changed plans. \nJust because something has been done for years, doesn\u2019t mean it needs or continue as circumstances change.", "I think NTA because you stayed home the first year after his Dad passed away and you had agreed to the Thanksgiving/Christmas arrangement for this year.  He changed his mind after all the arrangements were made.\n\nHowever, I think you and your husband need to talk about this more.  Where are he and his Mom in their grieving processes?  How does he envision things working in future years?  Does he want every Christmas with his Mom now?  Does he want to do alternate Christmases? Or is this year just particularly hard for both of them? \n\nAlso, is there an option to have your MIL join you in Hawaii since she\u2019s on her own?\n\nEDIT: Yes I have read OPs comments (which were posted after mine).  I may not agree with her entire perspective, but it doesn\u2019t change my thoughts and suggestions above.", "NAH\n\nI understand both sides.

It is tough but you want to be with your family as well.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "Couldn't his mother have come with you? A change of scenary over the holidays could have done her good.

I agree with you about not wanting to cancel and taking the kids to see your family. \n\nI do think you need to cut him some slack here though - the holidays can be really hard for people who have lost loved ones recently. I think you're all doing your best in this situation and I don't think there is any right answer here. Hopefully, your husband can join you next year, and maybe you could have a conversation about that when you get back.", "Bring his mom to Hawaii next year.", "NTA. It may be years before husband and his mom and family will be in a better place. I know it was for me, but I didn\u2019t change my children\u2019s lives except that first year. Life does go on.

Hes spending time with his mom, whos also grieving his dad, her husband. \n\nMyabe its a bit sucky of him to drop out of the vacay last minute, but also, its the first anniversary of his dads death.\n\nIdk. Hes not an asshole for grieving his dad. If he did this next year, then ya, hed be a jerk. \n\nYou arent really an asshole either, but I think it might be good to remember that hes grieving, even if he doesnt show it. \n\nIdk. \n\nEDIT\n\nI read OPs comments and *damn* woman, you sure dont have much empathy for your husband, do you? \n\nYTA", "NTA. While I understand that your husband wants to stay home & be with his mom--you had worked out a plan to all go with your family.\n\n  I'm not going to call anyone an AH in this scenario. He's obvs still grieving, as is his mom, and so he's now decided to stay home with her. Understandable.\n\n   But\\~I don't think it's right for him to expect you and the kids to stay home AFTER you agreed that you'd all go, after your parents paid for it, and *at the last minute.* \n\nTBH, I'd say drop the rope and know that you can't fix this until you are home\\~and perhaps go to a counselor together.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted for this, but NTA. If he had suggested 6 months ago - before the trip was planned and paid for - that you spend Christmas with his mom and adjusted the family holiday/Christmas schedule accordingly, then that would be different. But he waited until one week before, after you\u2019d already spent Thanksgiving with her and the whole trip was paid for, to suggest canceling your side of the family\u2019s holiday and do Christmas with her as well. \n\nI completely understand that he\u2019s grieving, but pushing through it a bit to support your family and honor the people you have left is just a reality of long term grief. There are no guarantees in life. What if one of OP\u2019s parents isn\u2019t still here next Christmas and they missed their last opportunity for this special week?\n\nBottom line: I understand and commiserate with his feelings, but I think casually expecting his whole family to cancel an amazing trip that was already paid for was unreasonable given the time frame, and at the very least, he shouldn\u2019t punish you for still going when he didn\u2019t.", "NTA: Everyone grieves differently, so he might still be hurting since he lost his father at this time of the year.\n\nThat being said, you both agreed to go to Hawaii for Christmas this year. Your father paid for your tickets and hotel (which is a huge wow!). To not go wouldn't be fair to your children who are looking forward to the trip and to your dad who put out a ton of money for the trip.\n\nBe kind to your hubs though and really talk about next year's plans. Christmas may never be the same for him again.", "Just to be clear, you\u2019re in Hawaii with your parents? Your family lives there? This isn\u2019t just a vacay? It\u2019s family time?", "Ok , for putting a time limit and judging your husband and MIL to limit their grieving process you\u2019re the AH. For going without him you\u2019re NTA. People grieve in their own time and in their own way. You have no right to set limits on that. Think about it.", "NAH he\u2019s grieving, but things were already paid for and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person for wanting to enjoy your families holiday tradition.", "NAH\n\nyour husband is grieving in not the most healthy way. You are on a vacation that was planned for a long time, to cancel last minute doesnt seem right. His time to disagree was when the plans were being made, not at the 11th hour. But Im sympathetic to him since grief does make people irrational.", "NTA. He's an adult -- you both agreed on a plan, and him backtracking on the plan isn't fair to you or your family. If he didn't think it was a good plan he had ample time to discuss with you.  \n\n\nI'm sympathetic to the fact the his mother doesn't have her husband any more. But does that mean you're never going to spend Christmas with your family from now on? Married life is about compromise, and your husband's priorities can't be singularly places with him mother any longer.", "I'm going with NTA. I understand he is still grieving, and so is his mom. What I don't agree with is changing his mind a week out from the trip that's already paid for and then getting mad that you didn't change plans with him. \n\nDo you know if his mom has expressed that she wants him to stay home for Christmas? If she did, why didn't he bring this up much sooner?", "NTA \u2026. If it was last year, you would be. He wants this to be your new tradition. Personally, I don\u2019t need to celebrate on a day, Christmas can be a family day whenever you get together with family", "NTA I understand that people think that you shouldn't feel like he's already over it if he wants to mourn but I think they are missing that there was an agreed upon plan in place for a while and just before the plan was enacted he backed out. Sure he might not have been over it but maybe he needed to be better at communicating that in a timely fashion rather than waiting?  He's your husband not your child and I don't see how you have to be expected to predict how he's feeling without him verbalizing it.  I can understand how he thinks his mom might need company but since he also has his own family to consider I think there should have been more discussion on his part about what he wanted or expected, especially with having pre-made plans and agreements.  Again you are not a mind reader and I don't think it'd especially fair to you and the kids for him to ask you guys to stay back after agreeing to go and going along with it all the while unless some other compromise had been formed since this plan was the result of the initial compromise of Thanksgiving with his side and Xmas with yours.  I think its a really emotionally charged situation that needs more communication but I wouldn't say anyone is TA unless one party gets mad at the other for something that was never communicated.", "YTA for your attitude *\"I* wasn't going to forgo *my* family's Christmas tradition and seeing *my* family *just for his mom\"* (italics added).  \n\nObviously his mom is important to him.  I get that you have to move on but grief is different for everyone.  This is the loss of her life partner.  You have put your tradition above your family which IMHO really sucks.", "Mixed feelings here... N T A because you BOTH agreed to this early in the year. And hubs decided last minute to back out...\n\nBut YTA aswell for feeling this way. My aunt died in 2005 on Thanksgiving night. These holidays are still hard for me and my family. She was like a 2nd mom to me. Grief isn't set in stone. After it had happened. It was easy for him to say 'yeah thats fine!\"\nBut now that the holiday time is here... and with winter depression already a thing... yeah I get that he wants to be home with his mom. \nAlso the part where you said 'me and the kids missed out last year'. That makes you sound like an 'A' because how I read it, is that his dad's death was a huge inconvenience because you didn't get to do what you wanted. \n\nI understand the plane tickets. Should get refundable tickets. But overall I'd have to say YTA", "NTA backing out a week before after your dad already paid is rude, I understand he\u2019s concerned about his mom but there was a plan in place. Now your kids aren\u2019t with their dad on Christmas so what benefit is that?!", "YTA\n\nThe first anniversary of a loved one dying is really hard and people react in different ways. He probably saw that his mother wasn't doing good in that time and wanted to be with her, and he probably needed you to support him as well. \n\nFamily tradition is important, and so is vacationing, but supporting your husband and your MIL is more important, especially during hardships like this. You could have traveled to see your family any other time. \n\nHe probably should have foreseen this, but sometimes you just can't.", "NTA. He is mourning and your family tradition is very important to you. Both of those things are completely valid. \n\nHe is more of the AH in this scenario because there is a lot of money wasted with a last minute back out like that.", "YTA. I\u2019m honestly shocked that you guys would even plan for Hawaii this year. How much of that was his idea and not just your urging? \n\nHe didn\u2019t lose his dad months before Christmas last year. He basically lost and laid him to rest DURING Christmas. And it didn\u2019t occur that this year may be hard for him and his mother? That he might not be in that aloha spirit? That his mom might not want her son and grand babies to be gone while she mourns her husband? \n\nYou do Hawaii every year. This is FIRST (I don\u2019t care how hard you argue that it\u2019s his second and imply he should be fine) holiday season without his dad. It\u2019s the anniversary of his dad dying. \n\nYou were wrong for even booking the tickets and not saying \u201chey honey, this could be a tough one, let\u2019s just spend Christmas at home with your mom and maybe we can all do Hawaii next year.\u201d", "YTA\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, you sound like you suck.\n\nYour husband is very clearly depressed. This is his first Christmas without his dad and you are supposed to be part of his support system. Yeah it sucks but sometimes you make sacrifices for the people you love. That may include cancelling the Hawaii trip. \n\nHave some empathy. When your dad croaks do you think he\u2019ll leave you alone to deal with it yourself?", "Probably not the popular opinion but NTA. Life moves forward. I understand it\u2019s hard as fuck, but you can\u2019t stay dwelling on bad things that have happened and stall everyone around you as well. If he wants to mourn for the holidays, he is free to, but you don\u2019t have to stay with him and mourn too. You made a plan, it was already paid for and hyped up to the kids, it\u2019s okay that you went.", "ESH. You act like he should have gotten over this already and he has a reason to be upset with you and want to talk to his kids. However, he should have talked about it with you before your dad paid for everything.", "NTA.\n\nI would have said No Assholes Here, but since your husband is treating you poorly, and the fact that you just saw the MIL and will see her again once you get back, I say NTA. You made agreed-upon plans with him and then he decided to stay home, wasting the money your father spent on him. I get your husband being sad and wanting to spend time with his mother, but not after already agreeing to these plans in advance. Him wanting to stay home is one thing, but to then act as if he's mad/sad about it, which seems like he's doing to make you feel guilty, is completely unacceptable. I personally couldn't imagine willingly being away from my wife and kids on Christmas, while simultaneously seating her with the brunt of having to watch the kids alone, even if I was in the same situation.", "YTA Grief is a long, messy, complicated thing. It tends to flare up, especially around anniversaries of tragedy, which you said this was. Your husband may have said he needed to be with his mom\u2026but he really needed you, his partner, to be there\u2026to support him and validate his emotional needs. But you, frankly, made selfish choices. You say he was upset that you weren\u2019t going to forego your family\u2019s tradition and seeing your family. I think you\u2019re missing the fact that YOUR family, is at its core, you, your husband, and children. You did forego your family by allowing it to be separated at Christmas over not respecting your mourning husband\u2019s grief. If it was me, and my wife emotionally abandoned me like that, I would be seriously considering divorce.", "NTA. You can't cancel an all expenses paid vacation 1 week before.  Seriously? That would be so incredibly rude. Op agreed to a compromise. How is she the AH for expecting that compromise to be fulfilled? Death is awful and grief is intense.  But her husband has known for a full year Christmas in Hawaii.  \n\nI sympathize with MIL and OPs husband.  I also experienced the death of my newborn son a week before Christmas. You carry the grief in your heart forever. :( But it's still Christmas. You have to move forward. I can't expect my extended family to not celebrate during the time of year when schools are closed and families have vacation time.", "Soft YTA. It's hard to judge you because I can understand your argument. But it's clear that your husband is still not over his dead passing away and he needed his family around him at this time of the year. He thought he's ok so he went ahead with planning this trip, but as the holiday approached, he realized he's not ok. Quite likely he has at least a minor depression. And now he feels kinda betrayed, because you chose your and your kids vacation over staying to support him. Your vacation will be over but you might have to work for quite a while to repair this rift. Well, at least he has his mom to lean on, so he's not fully alone.", "YTA\n\nAfter easing your responses you seem to lack all empathy here.

You still kept going to Hawaii every year, it was your husband's parents who change their Christmas celebration to New Year. \nObviously husband shouldn't have waited till after the tickets were bought before voicing his concerns but it really doesn't sound like it would have made a difference.

Her parents would be spending lots of time with them, like grandparents do.\n\nEDIT: She mentioned in a comment that her family lives all over the country and it's just their tradition to meet in Hawaii for Christmas.

I'm sorry that the plane and hotel were already booked and it sucks but it sounds like your husband needed support and to be around his mom and  wife and kids during this difficult time.

This is a sucky situation and you do deserve to see your family too but grief is not a straight path and there are ebbs and flows to it.

However, OP and their kids aren\u2019t wrong for wanting to continue a holiday tradition that includes happy family memories.

Plus, it would not have worked out well to tell their kids that the fun Hawaiian vacation they were looking forward to is now being scrapped so they can sit in a house of mourning with their dad and grandma. \n\nGoing forward they should discuss if he wants to change the arrangement to every other year with her family and the next year with his. HOWEVER, if this is the new plan then I think husband and MIL have a responsibility to find a way to make the Christmas celebration a happy one celebrating life, and not a time to just sit and mourn together. They could even make new traditions of having the kids make a Christmas card to put on grandpas grave, visit for a bit and then the family do something uplifting.

Grief doesn't have a time limit, but the first anniversary and holidays are the worst and it's when the grieving party needs the most support.\n\nNext year will be a little easier on her and more understandable with leaving on the traditional trip. \n\nIf this was me, I would have spent Christmas with my husband and MIL to show my support and be there for them. \n\nOP how would you feel if you lost your dad a year ago, and your husband and kids left you behind to go on a family vacation without you for the holidays? Would you want to talk to him? I get where your husband is coming from.\n\nYou can make plans months in advance, but as time gets closer feelings can change.

The reality is that this was going to be a tough year for him no matter what he did, and that's going to affect his spouse and kids if they care about him. What makes him TA (or not) is how he handles that, because it's also entirely reasonable for the spouse and kids to want their Christmas tradition. \n\nI can't tell from the post if anyone is actually TA at this point, or if it's just the situation that sucks. He may be keeping conversations brief because he doesn't want his sadness to spoil Christmas rather than because he's mad.

And if you don't you are an Asshole?  Sorry but strongly strongly disagree.  If you actually read the OP they have been supporting her strongly throughout the whole year, it's not a sin for her to want to be with her parents for a week.  Partnerships require compromise, when you decide you can throw away plans and money on a moments it's not really a good look.", "At most, NAH", "So OP, her kids and her family all get a Christmas ruined because of his grief? No, and I say this as someone who lost a parent four years ago. That\u2019s not okay or reasonable. He also only told her a week out.

I'm sitting here having had a mental breakdown last night because last Christmas was the last time I saw my father alive. He passed in January this year, shortly after christmas. I understand where OP's husband is. \n\nIt's the first anniversary. Grief is comes in waves, and I'll bet it hit him very hard recently when he realized his mom was going to be alone.

I feel like hands down OP is a heartless you know what!", "I'm glad I'm not alone.

That alone changes the vote for me.   \n\n\nThis was discussed before hand and if he'd said during the planning phase that he had doubts (and then she pushed for what she wanted) then yeah I could agree with YTA. But from what OP describes, and granted we weren't in the room, it sounds like husband was fine with the plans until he wasn't which unfortunately was a week before and after everything had been paid for. So they compromised and he stayed except now he's upset with her. His grief, while understandable, doesn't get to also get to dictate the holiday for everyone else.", "Seriously. Why couldn't they have stayed home for Christmas, and gone to Hawaii for New Year's? At the very least, they should have been alternating Christmases between her family and his. And for those saying that he made that choice years ago, something tells me that as this is something that her family has always done (and don't forget that Daddy pays!), he didn't really have much choice.", "I thought I was taking crazy pills reading some of these responses. This is the first year anniversary of his father's passing and she's more focused on missing out a fancy Hawaii vacation for...oh no 2 years? A trip that can be made at any other point in the year. At best I would go for NAH because the money spent. But the lack of basic sympathy towards her husband's grief...yikes.", "She could have if they discussed it and decided on it.  They made the plans together, he changed them within the week they were leaving.  What if her dad passed this year and she missed their last holiday together?

Perhaps if this decision had been made a month or 2 ago, they could have celebrated Thanksgiving with OP\u2019s family and gotten refunds on travel expenses, but the time frame here is a big deal. Also, while OP\u2019s husband is the one grieving hardest and wants to spend quality holiday time with his mom while he still has her\u2026 maybe OP wants the same thing with her family. Based on their typical travel patterns, and the fact that they couldn\u2019t go to Hawaii last year, it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s been 2+ years since she\u2019s spent either major holiday with her family.", "Don't punish the kids for their dad's grief.

Plane tickets no, hotel room could be figured out if the wife's family is welcoming.", "Unpopular opinion, and I'll take the downvotes.  \n\n\nI actually think it's okay that OPs family has their own tradition. Yes, marriage is a blending of two families, yadda yadda yadda. But come on -- spend a half day on this sub and it's obvious that it doesn't always work like that.

It's not required that OP's father pays for anyone who comes.", "Yeah obviously they are all adults and could just pay for his mom themselves. Which is why I'm saying why bring up this (her dad paying) as a reason for not inviting? That sounds just like an excuse and not a real reason. The real reason probably being is that they didn't want her there.", "Yes they are pretty expensive. Unless you live close to Hawaii, plane tickets for Christmas are thousands of dollars each. OP\u2019s father paid for her, the husband, and 2-3 kids. Hotels are hundreds of dollars a night there per room, and many charge extra if you have more than 2 people per room. $50k could be a stretch, but it would cost $15-20k easily. Factoring in that they missed last year (which was totally reasonable it was an unforeseen tragedy), \u201cwasting\u201d (I\u2019m using this term lightly just because these things were unrefundable) OP\u2019s fathers $15-20k two years in a row would be extremely rude.

It could be a few thousands dollars but if you go upscale it really could be tens of thousands of dollars. Obviously missing context here.", "Depends on what you're doing there and where you stay, but depending on where you live (if you're close to an international airport it's a little cheaper for flights) you can expect to pay around $1,500-$2,000 per plane ticket (so $6,000-$8,000 for all four of them), and more for add ons depending on what the airline charges. Then hotel rooms are anywhere from $250-$500 per night depending on where exactly in Hawaii you're staying (this is for basic rooms too, they get  more expensive from there), so for six nights that's $1,500-$3,000 plus all associated fees, which would probably put it closer to $2,000-$3,500 if not more. Then there's food expenses, travel expenses on the island, and so on. For a family of four, $13,000 is probably on the low end of an estimation to cover everything for a trip. Though in fairness, it would just be the hotel costs and airfair that can't be refunded, so $8,000- $11,500 would be lost depending on the exact costs. The rest of the money wouldn't have been pre-spent so it's not technically lost.\n\nThat's a lot of money to me IMHO, though it's not $50,000 lost.", "$50k is an exaggeration it but tens of thousands of dollars is plausible for a family trip to Hawaii on christmas.", "Flights. $600 pre Covid out of season from the west coast.

The first year, of course, but after that? The FIL death had meaning to OP as well and I don't blame her for having the yearning to be with her parents and siblings. Yes, it has only been a little over a year of grieving - but it has also been over a year where OP's family were less of a foucs in her and her husband's lives. It is totally understandable this was the case, but it is also totally understandable that OP was reminded of the mortality of her own parents throughout this last year as well and wants to be with them and participating in a family tradition. Yes, her husband and his mother were the primary grievers, but OP grieved as well and being the support system for people's grief is tough and often your grief and needs go completely unrecognized during the grieving process of the primary grievers.\n\nThey made the best compromise they could given the situation. It is OK to spend Christmas apart if the situation requires it. Husband and Wife have different needs for a few days. That is OK. They already have plans to celebrate on New Years as a full family and that will be lovely.\n\nI understand that Christmas is special for people, but it is special not just for OP's husband and MIL, it is special for OP, her family and her children. Family tradition is a huge comfort after a difficult year.

If they discussed it and planned in advance, the OP has every right to be upset at the cancellation of her plans the week before, when it\u2019s been planned and paid for. I also think the compromise was fair, other than it made the Dad miss spending Christmas with his kids, but expecting OP to miss Christmas with her family, when they missed the prior year and Thanksgiving was already spent with the Das mother, when it was planned well in advance is unrealistic. The OP would also have no way of knowing if they would also still be expected to uphold plans for New Years with his mom, which would mean the potential of no holidays for her family.\n\nThat said, the dad wasn\u2019t an AH either here.

All others must capitulate because it's what you want. Gotta have that vacay in Hawaii, there's nothing more important than that.\n\nAnd you deign to call it tradition in a feeble attempt to mask your selfishness behind a handy term in order to absolve yourself from the responsibility of your selfish decisions.

My grandma came the year after so she wouldn\u2019t be alone, and it was like a weird cloud formed. I felt pretty guilty for actually enjoying Christmas. She does this with all the other holidays- refuse to celebrate like we used to because he isn\u2019t here, and gets frustrated when we still do. \n\nHer anger from the grief has caused other problems that has made us have to go low contact, but if they\u2019re not careful it can effect kids by proxy more than they think.", "I think this is a critical comment. It doesn\u2019t sound at all like MIL will be totally alone. I think splitting up for the holiday this year makes a ton of sense.

Speaking as someone who lost someone close just this week, when people die close to a major holiday, it doesn't really hit that they're gone yet. This Christmas will be without her, but I'm still in so much shock over the loss, that I can't even begin to process that fact, and it likely won't hit me until next Christmas that this is for real and I'll never see her again. Grief is weird and it does unexpected things and you can think you're 100% good to go only to realize months later that you aren't.

As an adult,  I began to resent the one who passed,  plus my parent, who was basically forcing everyone else to stop moving forward.  I felt these things as an adult, someone who could reasonably remove myself from a situation or distance myself from this person (and I did.)

The kids missed Grandpa last year, now they get to have a happy holiday without tears.", "Yeah, I don't think anyone's an AH.  It sounds like MIL doesn't have anyone else but them, and she might now be completely alone on years she doesn't get them. He probably feels bad about her spending a major holiday alone, and is still grieving.  However, the trade-off is still going to have to happen unless she can accompany them.

It\u2019s easy to plan it out then the season comes and the impending trip of actually leaving becomes far more real and less theoretical and as more lights go up and commercials become ever present it hits you in a way it just wasn\u2019t when you agreed months earlier.

Idk how old her kids are but if I went in a trip alone and was parenting alone and my husband who decided not to come was upset would frustrate me too. I feel for him though, losing a parent is hard.

I see it as her feeling like this was a reasonable compromise and she's annoyed that her husband is now angry that she left with the kids vs. staying home. Not that she is annoyed at the inconvenience. Just that she's frustrated that he's now not communicating with her because she made the decision to take the kids and go spend the Holiday in Hawaii with her entire family.\n\nI'm also considering the fact that she likely hasn't spent the holiday with her entire family since 2019 - 3 years is a LONG time - especially when you have family members spread all over creation. Its SO special when everyone comes together to spend real time together, so its not just the expectation she'd walk away from a Hawaii vacation, but he is expecting her to walk away from a family reunion with extended family.\n\nI feel for both of them. The grieving process is SO hard. Its hard on the person who lost someone. Its hard on a supportive spouse. And it is TOTALLY understandable that after 3 years of the world being totally upside down that OP needs this time with her family. \n\nI think what is easy to forget is this passing wasn't in a vacuum.

It also feels like maybe this is one of the only times a year that her family actually all gets together.

I think at best, you are putting your side of the family over both him and his side of the family, while simultaneously being angry/annoyed at him for doing the exact same thing (and he has a legitimate reason to do this). \n\n\nI think initially, nobody really is the asshole. It appears that for a long time this has been your tradition to see your family this way, and you have other opportunities to see your husband\u2019s family throughout the year. (I will say that you don\u2019t seem to fully recognize that husband\u2019s family may also care about Christmas so them previously compromising so your side can keep your tradition could be a big deal). This year you made plans to continue that tradition. Again, no issues here. \n\nI don\u2019t think, like some other have said, that your husband is the AH for last minute changing his mind. Sure, he could have seen this coming earlier, but he probably had no idea how the anniversary of his fathers death would affect him and/or his mother. Once he realized this, what was he was supposed to do? Go to a tropical paradise and have fun with another family while the woman who raised him was home alone and likely struggling? Sure, it sucks and is bad for your prepaid tickets, but you can\u2019t be that upset at him for cancelling, and he can just pay your dad back. It sounds like an ideal compromise occurred. You and the kids go, and your husband stays to be with his mother. Is it the most ideal for both sides? Probably not. But it works relatively okay for both. \n\nAfter this point though, YTA. While it is true that he may be the AH for being short with you when you speak on the phone, from your comments it appears that you have moved into YTA territory so you can\u2019t really blame him too much. You don\u2019t seem to have much care or empathy for your husband\u2019s emotional state/situation on the anniversary of his fathers passing, particularly when it occurs over a holiday that traditionally is about being with family. You are putting your side of the family over him and his side of the family, while simultaneously being angry/annoyed at him for doing the exact same thing (and he has a legitimate reason to do this). \n\nLong story short, I think largely YTA. There was a death in the family, and not so surprisingly that made life more difficult for those involved. You\u2019re allowed to move on with your life, and want things to go back to normal (hence why at points NAH), but you\u2019re being bullish/not accepting that 1) it may never go back to normal, and 2) other people are still struggling.", "YTA most people missed that you don't give f about your husband family they miss all Christmas with sin because your trip to Hawaii.. living your obviously  depressed husband on Christmas time is YTA move.

He's the type of person that stays home from vacation to help the grieving person, she's the type to take a vacation over helping a grieving person/people.\n\nThe money doesn't matter if it was expendable enough to spend on vacation in the first place.

Open and HONEST communication is important here. Maybe they need to look at alternating between households for the holidays, spending extra non-holiday time with spouse's mother, inviting her to Hawaii with them, etc. But this needs to be communicated more than the week before. Neither OP nor spouse are the asshole. She is justified in continuing with the planned holiday (already bought and paid for), he is justified in feeling sad and deciding last minute to spend the holidays with his mother instead.

It would have been reasonable to discuss forgoing Hawaii this year *before purchases were made,* or it would have been equally reasonable for him to be understanding of OP and the kids still going while he stayed home (even though even that places all the parenting responsibilities on OP). But if he\u2019s hardly speaking to OP and upset that OP went to Hawaii, he\u2019s now directing his grief at his partner. Even if we can sympathize with him, it doesn\u2019t make him correct.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to remember that in this sub, \u201casshole\u201d isn\u2019t an overall character judgment, but a ruling that the actions/attitudes in the specific scenario were wrong. He can still be a perfectly good person, while also being \u201cthe asshole\u201d in this specific instance. Factually, he lacked the self-awareness to anticipate his needs, and is blaming his partner for that. \n\nI also need to add: when we\u2019re grieving, that\u2019s not a free pass to stop caring about our spouse\u2019s feelings and values, even if we can\u2019t put as much energy into actively supporting them. After losing a parent, he should have an even deeper appreciation for the importance of family, and that should extend to understanding why OP would want time with their own family. OP\u2019s family is spread out; OP didn\u2019t see them for thanksgiving; there\u2019s a decent chance these family gatherings aren\u2019t happening all that often, and they may be just once a year. To expect OP to miss out on such a valued family gathering without even giving OP notice isn\u2019t just asking OP to provide for his needs (after OP has, from what we know, been supportive of his grieving process for the past year, including missing their family gathering last Christmas); it\u2019s also asking OP to miss out on time with their family members, who are just as important to OP as his family is to him. OP\u2019s parents are likely around the same age as his, too. I would understand if he\u2019d been supportive of doing separate Christmases this year, but to be upset with OP for wanting family time that they missed last year, so he can see one family member a few days sooner, is pretty self-centered.", "Whoever is funding an entire family to go to Hawaii annually can afford to do so.", "I mean, they do have a full year to save up between three adults\u2026 it\u2019s not impossible", "Most people going yearly to Hawaii for Christmas have the funds for one extra ticket. \n\nOP talks about going yearly to Hawaii during one of the most popular times of the year and we\u2019re pretending they\u2019re in the poor house in the comments.", "It\u2019s already weird that OPs parents splash out that kind of money in the first place for a family with kids. No matter what my financial circumstances were I probably wouldn\u2019t let my parents pay for the flights of my entire family.", "Possibly ones that married into a family that can afford a fun little trip to Hawaii for the whole family each year?

Every year at Christmas the patriarch of the family gifted like $20,000  to each adult and $10,000 to every child present. If you weren\u2019t there, you didn\u2019t get the money. Needless to say my friend never got to spend Christmas Eve/Day with her side of the family and when she finally divorced, never had her children for those 2 days either. Although by appearances generous, I see it as a manipulative move to always get that holiday. This annual holiday tradition by OPs family fells very much the same to me. There is no other time this family can get together to visit?\nI don\u2019t see OP as the AH  for not cancelling the trip a week before it was supposed to happen but I do see her attitude as AH ish.", "Yes, but seeing OP's comments I doubt she even brought up that FIL is dead and MIL might need support.", "Because her dad pays for the trip every year, ya dunce.", "I actually really like celebrating holidays/birthdays on different days, because my husband and I also always celebrate on the day itself, so you get extra festivities that way.

Maybe he needed his wife and kids,too.", "Exactly! After my father in law passed away near Thanksgiving, my husband and I spent the next 3 Christmases vacationing in a nearby state. It actually really helped, especially the first 2 years when it still felt fresh. The first Christmas we were just numb, the second Christmas we were still sad but did ok, and by the third Christmas it just felt like a nice, new tradition. \n\nSo yeah, I am an advocate for a change of scenery for the holidays, after a major loss. It can really help ease the pain and grieving of not having your loved one at home to do the normal things like you've always done.", "The funeral was on the day of the flight last year.
