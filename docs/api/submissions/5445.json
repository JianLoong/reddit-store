I know your husband is in a tough spot but backing out at the last minute isn\u2019t fair to everyone else. It may be that in the future, you may need to compromise about Christmas, but if the compromise this year is him spending Christmas with his mom while the rest of you are in Hawaii \u2014 due to his last minute decision \u2014then both of you need to accept it and move on. \n\nThat said, YWBTA if you don\u2019t seriously consider compromising on how you spend Christmas in the future. People\u2019s lives change and your husband and his family may have different needs in the future, and you can\u2019t insist on getting your way every time.  I can\u2019t tell whether he asked earlier or if you just railroaded through on the Hawaii Christmas this year. But failing to understand the grief they are suffering would show a real lack of empathy.", "It\u2019s not just your mil still grieving, it\u2019s your husband. For some, the year after the person dies can be just as difficult. A lot of people will remember and reach out during that first year and then after move on, which is natural but the person that experienced the loss , is in a different place.\n\nYou\u2019re reaction oh, we canceled last year for the funeral, so we\u2019ve done our time with husbands family, isn\u2019t in line with what your husband is feeling/thinking.\n\nDid you really talk with him and ask him how he is doing? Ask him if he wanted to spend more time with his family or did you just assume, time to move on?\n\nDid you bring up maybe bringing MIL this year? \n\nI think your husband was maybe second guessing this trip sooner and might not have had the words.\n\nNAH because of the timing that the husband spoke up. But I wonder if he said something 3 months ago if you would have heard him and changed plans. \nJust because something has been done for years, doesn\u2019t mean it needs or continue as circumstances change.", "I think NTA because you stayed home the first year after his Dad passed away and you had agreed to the Thanksgiving/Christmas arrangement for this year.  He changed his mind after all the arrangements were made.\n\nHowever, I think you and you husband need to talk about this more.  Where are he and his Mom in their grieving processes?  How does he envision things working in future years?  Does he want every Christmas with his Mom now?  Does he want to do alternate Christmases? Or is this year just particularly hard for both of them? \n\nAlso, is there an option to have your MIL join you in Hawaii since she\u2019s on her own?", "NAH\n\nI understand both sides. Loosing someone close to Christmas sucks (I lost my cat recently, my dog died several years ago between Christmas and new year and a relative died 15 minutes into 2021). It is tough but you want to be with your family as well.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "Couldn't his mother have come with you? A change of scenary over the holidays could have done her good. Traditions DO change when someone dies. Due to my grandmother's illness they were always home over the holidays but when she had passed grandfather travelled to us every year.", "Info: why not just bring mom to hawaii?", "NAH\n\nI feel for your husband, he lost his Dad a year ago and his Mom is spending Christmas without her partner. \n\nWith plane tickets bought and hotels arranged - a week out is not enough time to change plans. I agree with you about not wanting to cancel and taking the kids to see your family. \n\nI do think you need to cut him some slack here though - the holidays can be really hard for people who have lost loved ones recently. I think you're all doing your best in this situation and I don't think there is any right answer here. Hopefully, your husband can join you next year, and maybe you could have a conversation about that when you get back.", "Bring his mom to Hawaii next year.", "NTA. It may be years before husband and his mom and family will be in a better place. I know it was for me, but I didn\u2019t change my children\u2019s lives except that first year. Life does go on. Husband and his mom need grief counseling.", "Hes grieving for his dad. Hes spending time with his mom, whos also grieving his dad, her husband. \n\nMyabe its a bit sucky of him to drop out of the vacay last minute, but also, its the first anniversary of his dads death.\n\nIdk. Hes not an asshole for grieving his dad. If he did this next year, then ya, hed be a jerk. \n\nYou arent really an asshole either, but I think it might be good to remember that hes grieving, even if he doesnt show it. \n\nIdk. NAH.", "NTA. While I understand that your husband wants to stay home & be with his mom--you had worked out a plan to all go with your family.\n\n  I'm not going to call anyone an AH in this scenario. He's obvs still grieving, as is his mom, and so he's now decided to stay home with her. Understandable.\n\n   But\\~I don't think it's right for him to expect you and the kids to stay home AFTER you agreed that you'd all go, after your parents paid for it, and *at the last minute.* \n\nTBH, I'd say drop the rope and know that you can't fix this until you are home\\~and perhaps go to a counselor together.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted for this, but NTA. If he had suggested 6 months ago - before the trip was planned and paid for - that you spend Christmas with his mom and adjusted the family holiday/Christmas schedule accordingly, then that would be different. But he waited until one week before, after you\u2019d already spent Thanksgiving with her and the whole trip was paid for, to suggest canceling your side of the family\u2019s holiday and do Christmas with her as well. \n\nI completely understand that he\u2019s grieving, but pushing through it a bit to support your family and honor the people you have left is just a reality of long term grief. There are no guarantees in life. What if one of OP\u2019s parents isn\u2019t still here next Christmas and they missed their last opportunity for this special week?\n\nBottom line: I understand and commiserate with his feelings, but I think casually expecting his whole family to cancel an amazing trip that was already paid for was unreasonable given the time frame, and at the very least, he shouldn\u2019t punish you for still going when he didn\u2019t.", "NTA: Everyone grieves differently, so he might still be hurting since he lost his father at this time of the year.\n\nThat being said, you both agreed to go to Hawaii for Christmas this year. Your father paid for your tickets and hotel (which is a huge wow!). To not go wouldn't be fair to your children who are looking forward to the trip and to your dad who put out a ton of money for the trip.\n\nBe kind to your hubs though and really talk about next year's plans. Christmas may never be the same for him again.", "Just to be clear, you\u2019re in Hawaii with your parents? Your family lives there? This isn\u2019t just a vacay? It\u2019s family time?", "Ok , for putting a time limit and judging your husband and MIL to limit their grieving process you\u2019re the AH. For going without him you\u2019re NTA. People grieve in their own time and in their own way. You have no right to set limits on that. Think about it.", "NAH he\u2019s grieving, but things were already paid for and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person for wanting to enjoy your families holiday tradition.", "NAH\n\nyour husband is grieving in not the most healthy way. You are on a vacation that was planned for a long time, to cancel last minute doesnt seem right. His time to disagree was when the plans were being made, not at the 11th hour. But Im sympathetic to him since grief does make people irrational.", "NTA. He's an adult -- you both agreed on a plan, and him backtracking on the plan isn't fair to you or your family. If he didn't think it was a good plan he had ample time to discuss with you.  \n\n\nI'm sympathetic to the fact the his mother doesn't have her husband any more. But does that mean you're never going to spend Christmas with your family from now on? Married life is about compromise, and your husband's priorities can't be singularly places with him mother any longer.", "I'm going with NTA. I understand he is still grieving, and so is his mom. What I don't agree with is changing his mind a week out from the trip that's already paid for and then getting mad that you didn't change plans with him. \n\nDo you know if his mom has expressed that she wants him to stay home for Christmas? If she did, why didn't he bring this up much sooner?", "NTA \u2026. If it was last year, you would be. He wants this to be your new tradition. Personally, I don\u2019t need to celebrate on a day, Christmas can be a family day whenever you get together with family", "NTA I understand that people think that you shouldn't feel like he's already over it if he wants to mourn but I think they are missing that there was an agreed upon plan in place for a while and just before the plan was enacted he backed out. Sure he might not have been over it but maybe he needed to be better at communicating that in a timely fashion rather than waiting?  He's your husband not your child and I don't see how you have to be expected to predict how he's feeling without him verbalizing it.  I can understand how he thinks his mom might need company but since he also has his own family to consider I think there should have been more discussion on his part about what he wanted or expected, especially with having pre-made plans and agreements.  Again you are not a mind reader and I don't think it'd especially fair to you and the kids for him to ask you guys to stay back after agreeing to go and going along with it all the while unless some other compromise had been formed since this plan was the result of the initial compromise of Thanksgiving with his side and Xmas with yours.  I think its a really emotionally charged situation that needs more communication but I wouldn't say anyone is TA unless one party gets mad at the other for something that was never communicated.", "YTA for your attitude *\"I* wasn't going to forgo *my* family's Christmas tradition and seeing *my* family *just for his mom\"* (italics added).  \n\nObviously his mom is important to him.  I get that you have to move on but grief is different for everyone.  This is the loss of her life partner.  You have put your tradition above your family which IMHO really sucks.", "Mixed feelings here... N T A because you BOTH agreed to this early in the year. And hubs decided last minute to back out...\n\nBut YTA aswell for feeling this way. My aunt died in 2005 on Thanksgiving night. These holidays are still hard for me and my family. She was like a 2nd mom to me. Grief isn't set in stone. After it had happened. It was easy for him to say 'yeah thats fine!\"\nBut now that the holiday time is here... and with winter depression already a thing... yeah I get that he wants to be home with his mom. \nAlso the part where you said 'me and the kids missed out last year'. That makes you sound like an 'A' because how I read it, is that his dad's death was a huge inconvenience because you didn't get to do what you wanted. \n\nI understand the plane tickets. Should get refundable tickets. But overall I'd have to say YTA", "NTA backing out a week before after your dad already paid is rude, I understand he\u2019s concerned about his mom but there was a plan in place. Now your kids aren\u2019t with their dad on Christmas so what benefit is that?!", "YTA\n\nThe first anniversary of a loved one dying is really hard and people react in different ways. He probably saw that his mother wasn't doing good in that time and wanted to be with her, and he probably needed you to support him as well. \n\nFamily tradition is important, and so is vacationing, but supporting your husband and your MIL is more important, especially during hardships like this. You could have traveled to see your family any other time. \n\nHe probably should have foreseen this, but sometimes you just can't.", "NTA. He is mourning and your family tradition is very important to you. Both of those things are completely valid. \n\nHe is more of the AH in this scenario because there is a lot of money wasted with a last minute back out like that.", "YTA. I\u2019m honestly shocked that you guys would even plan for Hawaii this year. How much of that was his idea and not just your urging? \n\nHe didn\u2019t lose his dad months before Christmas last year. He basically lost and laid him to rest DURING Christmas. And it didn\u2019t occur that this year may be hard for him and his mother? That he might not be in that aloha spirit? That his mom might not want her son and grand babies to be gone while she mourns her husband? \n\nYou do Hawaii every year. This is FIRST (I don\u2019t care how hard you argue that it\u2019s his second and imply he should be fine) holiday season without his dad. It\u2019s the anniversary of his dad dying. \n\nYou were wrong for even booking the tickets and not saying \u201chey honey, this could be a tough one, let\u2019s just spend Christmas at home with your mom and maybe we can all do Hawaii next year.\u201d", "YTA\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, you sound like you suck.\n\nYour husband is very clearly depressed. This is his first Christmas without his dad and you are supposed to be part of his support system. Yeah it sucks but sometimes you make sacrifices for the people you love. That may include cancelling the Hawaii trip. \n\nHave some empathy. When your dad croaks do you think he\u2019ll leave you alone to deal with it yourself?", "Probably not the popular opinion but NTA. Life moves forward. I understand it\u2019s hard as fuck, but you can\u2019t stay dwelling on bad things that have happened and stall everyone around you as well. If he wants to mourn for the holidays, he is free to, but you don\u2019t have to stay with him and mourn too. You made a plan, it was already paid for and hyped up to the kids, it\u2019s okay that you went.", "ESH. You act like he should have gotten over this already and he has a reason to be upset with you and want to talk to his kids. However, he should have talked about it with you before your dad paid for everything.", "NTA.\n\nI would have said No Assholes Here, but since your husband is treating you poorly, and the fact that you just saw the MIL and will see her again once you get back, I say NTA. You made agreed-upon plans with him and then he decided to stay home, wasting the money your father spent on him. I get your husband being sad and wanting to spend time with his mother, but not after already agreeing to these plans in advance. Him wanting to stay home is one thing, but to then act as if he's mad/sad about it, which seems like he's doing to make you feel guilty, is completely unacceptable. I personally couldn't imagine willingly being away from my wife and kids on Christmas, while simultaneously seating her with the brunt of having to watch the kids alone, even if I was in the same situation.", "YTA Grief is a long, messy, complicated thing. It tends to flare up, especially around anniversaries of tragedy, which you said this was. Your husband may have said he needed to be with his mom\u2026but he really needed you, his partner, to be there\u2026to support him and validate his emotional needs. But you, frankly, made selfish choices. You say he was upset that you weren\u2019t going to forego your family\u2019s tradition and seeing your family. I think you\u2019re missing the fact that YOUR family, is at its core, you, your husband, and children. You did forego your family by allowing it to be separated at Christmas over not respecting your mourning husband\u2019s grief. If it was me, and my wife emotionally abandoned me like that, I would be seriously considering divorce.", "NTA. You can't cancel an all expenses paid vacation 1 week before.  Seriously? That would be so incredibly rude. Op agreed to a compromise. How is she the AH for expecting that compromise to be fulfilled? Death is awful and grief is intense.  But her husband has known for a full year Christmas in Hawaii.  \n\nI sympathize with MIL and OPs husband.  I also experienced the death of my newborn son a week before Christmas. You carry the grief in your heart forever. :( But it's still Christmas. You have to move forward. I can't expect my extended family to not celebrate during the time of year when schools are closed and families have vacation time.", "Soft YTA. It's hard to judge you because I can understand your argument. But it's clear that your husband is still not over his dead passing away and he needed his family around him at this time of the year. He thought he's ok so he went ahead with planning this trip, but as the holiday approached, he realized he's not ok. Quite likely he has at least a minor depression. And now he feels kinda betrayed, because you chose your and your kids vacation over staying to support him. Your vacation will be over but you might have to work for quite a while to repair this rift. Well, at least he has his mom to lean on, so he's not fully alone.", "YTA\n\nAfter easing your responses you seem to lack all empathy here. It\u2019s the anniversary of your FIL dying of course this time of year is hard for your husband and his mom and he would want to be there to support her.

You still kept going to Hawaii every year, it was your husband's parents who change their Christmas celebration to New Year. \nObviously husband shouldn't have waited till after the tickets were bought before voicing his concerns but it really doesn't sound like it would have made a difference. You make it sound like your father's in law passing away last year was just an inconvenience that kept you from going to your trip and your failing to show your husband any empathy, you're just thinking about yourself", "YTA.

Not only would my ex's family have happily included my family members in any celebration while we were together, I'm pretty sure they would still welcome us because we're family to the kids (awkward as that would be).", "Personally I find it rude that you didn\u2019t ask and would rather your widowed mil spend the holidays alone.", "Marriage is a melding of two families..", "Ok, now you\u2019re the asshole. \n\n-   Who, exactly, would have the issue with your MIL joining?  I understand that your parents organized the trip, but who exactly would it upset for your MIL to join?  You?  Your parents?\n\n- it wouldn\u2019t make sense for your parents to pay, but you could offer to pay for her flight and hotel as a Christmas gift.\n\n- or, you can invite her to come along and she can pay for her own trip.    That is what most adults do when they go on vacations with multiple adults - everyone pays for themself.", "Aaaaaand this is where you lost me. \nMy family would have absolutely no problem with me bringing my widowed MIL for the holidays so she's not alone. They'd understand and welcome her. \nYou guys could've paid for her ticket(both you, mil and husband). Especially since there would've been time to save. But because you didn't want to find any other solutions, I'm going to vote YTA", "Maybe your mother in law would pay for herself. Do you really hate the woman this much not to consider her family? Does your family hate her?", "NTA, You\u2019re spending time with your family for the holidays not just going on a vacay. This is reasonable but so is him staying with his mom. He can\u2019t expect you to stop seeing your family or change your long standing tradition. \n\nHim and his mom are still grieving. Understandable. He needs kindness from you but he should also understand, having just lost a parent, how important it is for you to spend time with your parents. You only get so many holidays. \n\nTry to get him into grief counseling and consider couples counseling if he continues to be cold. Kindness needs to be abundant from you both. \n\nYou should add to your OP that your family gathers in Hawaii from all over the country to celebrate Christmas and this is a once a year opportunity to be with your family.", "So you could have met anywhere else in the country instead of flying to the most isolated populated place on earth?", "Right. Need to space it ty", ">I agree with your comment 100%. But also want to add that since you put \"not ta\" first, the bot will count as that, even though your actual evaluation is opposite.\n\nOh wow, didn't know there's a bot that's counting :D\n\nWhere can I see the overall verdict / results?", "I have no idea what your saying", "So in his shoes, you'd leave your mom, who lost her husband (your dad) around this time of the year, to celebrate her first Christmas alone?", "So it\u2019s also the anniversary of his father\u2019s passing.\n\nHow did you think this comment would make the situation better?", "\ud83d\ude10So your husbands dad\u2019s funeral was a week before Christmas and you don\u2019t see why Christmas may be affecting his emotions?", "My mothers funeral was last year a few days before christmas. I was sad but to tensed to feel real grief.\n\nA few days ago it hit me really hard and I'm ... extremely sad, cry often.\n\nThis christmas (the second !) is very hard for me. I did not expect that.\n\nNTA - because I understand that You planned ahead and the time for cancelling is short. \n\nI just want to explain what may have happended to your husband.", "So it\u2019s the first Christmas that actually feels like Christmas then. My mom passed a month before Christmas and we went through the motions that year for my kids but it wasn\u2019t Christmas. It wasn\u2019t until the next year that we really had to figure out how to navigate Christmas without her. Your husband\u2019s feelings and those of his family are justified, he just should have told you sooner than the night before the flight.", "So when you said your vows, you really meant \u201cfor better or for worse but NOT DURING MY HAWAII WEEK\u201d.", "So then it\u2019s the first anniversary of his dad\u2019s death? Yeah lady YTA", "I'd argue that after backing out of a long-planned vacation, the least husband can do is be kind over the phone, especially over a holiday?", "Also imagine how the kids would feel having the rug pulled out on their Christmas due to dad's last minute wave of grief after planning.", "Is this not what flight insurance is for?", "100 percent. Horrible timing. I feel terrible for all involved.", "Reading between the lines, this sounds like a very expensive vacation that OPs parents pay for every year. I can absolutely see how it would be a little weird for OPs parents to pay for MIL to go on vacation with them, and not really appropriate of OP to ask if it hasn't been offered. Alternatively, I can see how it would be uncomfortable for OP's MIL to have someone else pay for her to go on vacation.", "Ideally yes. Sometimes it doesn't work out. Perhaps this is one of these cases...", "But the husband decided a week before to change plans after her parents had paid for everything. She still sucks but yeah..", "What does that matter? Flying to Atlanta vs Hawaii doesn't matter as they will still need a phone to chat, how is the distance relevant? Also the whole extended family shouldn't have to change plans. Maybe they are all on the West coast and it is a quick trip, we have no idea.", "That her family want to spend holidays with the children and her too.", "Yes. Husband's priority should be his own children and family, not his mother.  \n\n\nAlso, why is taking care of MIL falling solely on husband. There's virtually no other family members? Did MIL spend Christmas alone with her husband every year up until the death?", "It\u2019s not her first Christmas alone. The funeral was a week before Christmas Day.", "He's grieving. Perhaps he doesn't have any energy even to smile to himself, lest alone to smile to his wife, who left him to grieve alone (with his mom). He's most likely suffering from some amount of depression. When someone is depressed, they are excused for not having energy to be cheerful. They need help, sometimes just a kind word and a shoulder to cry on, sometimes even medical help.", "This wouldn't qualify as a covered expense under most basic plans.  Deaths of relatives a year prior would not be covered. The \"cancel for any reason\" policies are more expensive than the basic coverage. And most people only purchase basic \"emergency or illness\" policies.  Because why else would you cancel a vacation unless it was an emergency or illness? How do you know a policy was purchased?", "When I die, I hope it's on some random day, so that my daughter doesn't need to go through this kind of dilemma :D", "I suppose it depends on whether it would be feasible for OP and husband to pay for MiL or at least offer to?", "People here are being very generous with other people's money.", "Ok I figured that's what you meant. And yes! They don't see her family very much and it's not fair to her side.", "You keep saying this and it comes across like you have the empathy of a Christmas turkey. I hope for your sake that when your parents die, your husband is kinder to you", "I will be not surprised if neither your husband nor his mom remember clearly how last Christmas went. They were still dazed from his dad dying. This is the first time they are actually going into it with somewhat \"cool heads\". He thought he could handle it, so agreed on the trip together. But in the end he can't handle it. It's not wrong. He needs more time. Try to be supportive, and don't expect him to be nice to you on the phone, he probably feels betrayed.", "No perhaps not, but last Christmas the grief would have been so raw. I think you need to be kinder to your husband really, you come across as a little harsh and some of your comments. I'd go with NAH because he did agree and your dad has paid for flights etc so to suddenly change is rude however, your comments make me lean toward you being the AH because they just don't come across nice. Does your husband have any siblings who could have spent Christmas with MIL? If not you might have to accept that Hawaii won't be an every year thing moving forward, as your husband will likely want to see his mum which is fair.", "You seem kind of like an AH for this comment. Don\u2019t you think the first anniversary of her husband\u2019s death will be difficult for your MIL? Would she be spending Christmas alone if your husband hadn\u2019t stayed for her?", "I just re-read the story and can't see any mention of her family living in Hawaii. The only mention of her parents is that her dad bought her plane tickets to Hawaii and booked a hotel there. And \"So now I\u2019m in Hawaii watching and rangling the kids by myself.\" - if they were visiting her parents there, why would she be wrangling the kids by herself? Her parents would be spending lots of time with them, like grandparents do.\n\nEDIT: She mentioned in a comment that her family lives all over the country and it's just their tradition to meet in Hawaii for Christmas. I think that in her shoes I'd stay with the husband, just this particular time, and come up with a really good plan for next year. But I also understand that she and her kids miss the rest of her family and would like to see them. But still, her own family (husband) trumps that. If he keeps doing that every year, that would not be manageable, just this one time maybe he really needs her shoulder."]}
