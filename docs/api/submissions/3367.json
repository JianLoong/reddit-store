I don't think it's child abuse, I think it's it's family. I do have 5 kids and sure, if I go grocery shopping, the older children watch the younger. That's just normal\nIf no adult was at home and the 10 year old had to watch his siblings hours long, I would agree with you, but that's not the case.", "NTA. My sister and I are 7 years apart. I WAS the 10 year old watching the 3 year old. Imagine being 10 and trying to figure out how to soothe a toddler having a total meltdown bc she doesn\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t play with the kitchen knives. It\u2019s distressing, and your brother and your fianc\u00e9 are the idiots.", "Info: Does the ten-year-old care for the two-year-old by himself, or is an adult in the house? I had younger brothers and often kept them entertained.  Sometimes my mother asked me to do it so she could perform a task, and sometimes I just played with them because I enjoyed it. I was nine when the younger one was two. I also have an older brother who played with the younger ones. We all played together sometimes. My mother was nearby. Is this what your brother meant? Child abuse is a strong term.", "INFO:  are parents in the house?   How does this all happen?   \n\nI think you are responding on a lack of complete info.   A ten year playing with 4 younger siblings while Dad is mowing  and Mom is cleaning, is very different than  10 year old in charge while Dad is at work and Mom is at the store.\n\n\nOverall, having an older child occasionally look after a younger child or two, when parent determines that older is responsible enough, and younger kids actually listen to older,  is fine.   Not many ten year olds meet that criteria in my book, but I won't rule out there might be times when it is okay.     Key word is occasionally.   Having the 10 year old watch daily, on their own, nope, not a good idea.", "One thing to take into consideration is whether or not the older children are being forced to provide childcare services, or if they're doing it happily, willingly, and without being asked. I was 14 when my youngest brother was born, and I did tons of his care. I changed diapers, wore him in a sling, gave him baths, dressed him, played with him, and, once I had my driver's license, took him places with me. He once injured the roof of his mouth by tripping with a plastic recorder in his mouth while he was learning to walk, and when Mom nursed him to console him, his baby brain connected the pain to nursing, and blamed Mama for hurting him (almost broke her heart). He gave her the cold shoulder for about 10 days, and would only come to me for care and comfort. My mom has bragged to others that she never had to hire a babysitter once I hit 12, because I was always more than willing to cancel plans and take care of my babies. \n\nAll this to say, I definitely understand why you say it's child abuse, and that is actually something CPS will look at, but not every case of siblings being charge is abuse. Sometimes it's a loving, mutual agreement.", "NTA. Take it from the oldest of 6, it's child abuse. Having them help out with \"can you grab me a diaper? \" or something similar isn't. But leaving a child to take care of another child? Not ok.", "NAH.  It\u2019s hard to know of the doctor with the children said that tongue in cheek, and what any support they have in place looks like.  The initial comment could have been joking around, your brother was not an AH for repeating it, not info info to know if the doctor was an AH for saying it, and you\u2019re certainly not an AH for saying what you said, because you\u2019re right.  Parentification is real and wrong.   If the large family is using older kids in place of parental or other adult supervision they are AHs, but there isn\u2019t near enough info in the post to draw that conclusion.", "YTA,  I believe you went overboard. It seemed to me that the comment by the father of the 9 children said it in jest.", "YTA: you jumped to horrific conclusions based on one throwaway statement.", "YTA\n\nI am shocked by the number of people who seem to think watching your younger siblings for a while constitutes child abuse?\n\nIt\u2019s not that it absolutely COULDN\u2019T be abuse, YTA because you assumed abuse when there are so many potential shades of gray in between. \n\nAlso the comment \u201cobviously money is not a struggle for them\u201d really rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nWith nine kids? Even as a doctor, money could absolutely still be a struggle for them. ESP with such high cost of living these days.\n\n Regardless, asking an older sibling to watch a younger sibling for a while (at max a few hours, and not everyday) should not be considered child abuse, and assuming otherwise is imo a bad faith assumption.", "YTA and I'm so tired of people watering down serious terms like \"child abuse\".", "YTA \n\nYou are taking this from zero to 100 for no reason. There\u2019s a lot of ground between \u201cwatching\u201d and \u201cbabysitting\u201d. Watching indicates the parent is there, just focusing on something else. So if the younger one needed CPR, the older one could call attention to it and the parent would take over. It would be different if the 10yo were left alone with the 2yo while the parents were out somewhere, but nothing about your post indicates that to be true. \n\nThere is also a huge difference between child abuse and teaching kids responsibility. I saw on another thread someone claiming that having a kid do chores to earn an allowance was child labor. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you shared the same view. I do not understand why everything needs to be one extreme or the other. \n\nYour fiancee and brother are right. You were being dumb and making a big deal out of nothing. This is a basic example of asking kids to help out a little with age and ability appropriate tasks so they can become responsible and capable adults.", "YTA for assuming the kids are taking on serious childcare responsibilities. Of course kids can play together and older ones can keep an eye out for younger ones. That doesnt equal full time nanny, which you are implying.", "You don\u2019t know any real details of their life. \u201cChild abuse\u201d is a heavy fkn accusation to throw around like that.

It\u2019s part of being a family.", "Ohhh, based on your comment where you actually describe what your brother was really saying, hidden in the comments how dare you, is that the mother is home with the children but obviously because there is nine of them is not watching them every single second.\n\nYTA because with that information, what it says is that you responded negatively to the size of your brother's coworker's family and then made it a huge drama at the table to villainize them for having that many kids because your personal opinion is that that is wrong.\n\nWhile I agree that that many kids is a problem if they're all happening at the same time, your brother and sister-in-law are not wrong that you made a drama at the table and went out of your way to frame it as an abusive situation to prove your point", "YTA there is a difference between parentification and older siblings looking out for younger ones- it sounds more like your brother just has no fucking idea how much actual work his wife does and dismisses it as \"the kids take care of themselves\".", "YTA. I'm guessing you have just the one kid but lots of opinions on parenting. No one in this story is letting a 10-year-old actually babysit a 2-year-old. The most they'd do is make sure the little sibling doesn't jump off the couch or eat a crayon. Or to get a parent if things look dicey. All older siblings do this. It's not a problem and it's how siblings bond. I'm sure you and your bro did it too as kids. It only becomes a problem when they're left to do major things like get baby sister to school or to feed them something more than a snack.", "YTA \n\nDon\u2019t say shit like that, what is wrong with you? \n\nSome big families work that way. Mind your own fuckin business. Jesus Christ some people", "NTA and not only it\u2019s putting a huge amount of responsibility on a child that is not emotionally, mentally, nor physically prepared for it, but also children being left under the care of other children is a red flag for CPS (or the equivalent in other countries).\n\nChildren have to be children. It\u2019s one thing to do small chores like taking care of your stuff (like keeping your room clean), but siblings are not a substitute for childcare. \n\nI\u2019m shocked by the amount of YTA on the replies.\n\nEDIT to add: I was saw a 4 year old get hit by a car after he run to the street chasing after his ball. He was being \u201cwatched\u201d by his 8 year old sister. That shit is NOT okay. Accidents can happen in the blink of an eye and you cannot make CHILDREN responsible for your decisions to have more kids.", "Nta. You are right. What it sounds like is making older children routinely look after younger children. That is wrong. All kids deserve time to just be kids.", "NAH. You don't know enough about the situation to make a judgment about their choices. A lot of my friends with large families have said \"at a certain point, they take care of themselves\" not in a parenting their siblings way, but in a \"they have playmates so they don't rely on constant parent companionship\" way. My friend has 6 kids and the oldest two don't provide child care but they do enjoy entertaining the younger kids. They build forts and play games while mom or dad cooks or cleans. My kid has no one but me or her dad to play with so she seeks us out. If she had a sibling, she could play with them. She is very good at entertaining herself but when she needed supervision, there was no alternative but mom and dad.\n\nSiblings play together. Its extreme to call it child abuse even if the 10 year old makes sure the 2 year old stay in the yard while playing outside while dad is working and mom is cooking.", "I'm the sibling who had siblings who were three and five tears younger than me respectively. Guess who got saddled with childcare.\n\nNTA OP, you should be proud of yourself for being the person to speak up on this. People don't understand how damaging it is to have siblings look after younger siblings without parental supervision and a bit shocking to see how many are comfortable with saddling older children with this. It only screws up the family dynamics and places unnecessary burdens on children that should be doing normal children things. \n\nThe statement of \"after 4 kids they start raising themselves\" was scary enough on its own without him doubling down on it with clarifying he has his older kids look after his younger kids. \n\nPlease don't listen to everyone trying to normalise something that studies gave shown to be damaging.

They didn\u2019t have to, they could call me, but they enjoyed the independence. \n\nWe don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s abuse from the info OP gave us. NAH", "Nta\n\nYou are right, it is.

I just read this outloud to my team at work... 30 people, all parents... And were all agreeing YTA. There's a big difference between having your older children help out... Which is what it sounds like... Than being a free 24/7 babysitter, which your implying. I'm sure having the older kids do some diaper changes or a few minor things is more what they mean. My coworker right here has 10 children 18-3. The older ones help out. Big difference than being \"abused\".", "YTA, older kids watching younger kids is super basic human/family behavior, calling it child abuse is shocking to me. You really need to check your privilege.", "NAH, I think you have a good point but you're communicating it very poorly, and your brother was responding to that. It's not child abuse or parentification for an older child to occasionally be expected to keep an eye on a younger sibling if a parent is in the house, or to sometimes actually babysit once they're 12+ or so (depending on the care needs and responsibility levels of the kids ofc). \n\nBut it *is* parentification if older children are so regularly expected to care for their younger siblings that they don't have time to be a kid themselves, they start feeling responsibility for raising the kids. That's probably fairly common/likely once you have that many kids, and it's a reasonable point for you to make.\n\nBut if you make the bold, reductive, and kind of ridiculous statement that it's child abuse in general to ever expect an older child to watch a younger child, it makes sense that your brother will disagree.", "Yta", "YTA to casually decree child abuse based on one statement. Older kids watch younger kids all the time. You didn't ask if other adults were around or how long they watched their siblings. You're acting like they abandon all 9 kids and leave them to fend for themselves.", "It is one thing to ask a 12 year old to keep an eye on a younger sibling while to run to the bathroom or grab the mail.  It is completely different when you ask them to help in child rearing.\n\nYou aren't raising your kids if you are using the buddy system and assigning a younger child to an older child.\n\nI also believe it is acceptable to pay your older child the going rate to babysit if, and only if, they want to do it.  You should not force your older kids to be free babysitters for the younger ones because you need a night out.  They should not miss events or plans with their friends because mom and dad need a break.", "NTA. I wish someone would\u2019ve told my parents this. Thank you for trying to talk sense into your brother.", "YTA. Is it necessarily a good thing? no. But you don\u2019t know the exact specifics and abuse is a strong word for something like that.", "NTA. My friend is the oldest of five and as soon as she could drive she was charge of driving her younger siblings to and from sports practice and events on top of making dinner and whatever other chores her mom wouldn\u2019t do. Her siblings are in middle and high school now and nothing has changed. If they\u2019re not going to parent their kids and are gonna have the kids \u201cwatch themselves\u201d they don\u2019t need to be having 5+ kids. I can\u2019t imagine leaving a literal infant in the care of an unsupervised ten year old. Parents who chose to have a herd of children need to let their children be children instead of ripping away their childhoods and forcing them to be parents.", "NTA. My sister and I where 13 and 14, and we watched six children ages 1 to 11. It sucked and was too much for us at the time. Kids younger then 13 legally can't watch their younger siblings in most states of the US, or legally be left alone in the house by themselves, much less with a toddler to care for. \n\nIt's personification for sure and a dangerous practice. Unfortunately the only way they will learn is when something bad happens and DCFS steps in due to mandatory reporting", "OK, I am giving family story time, because this is a thing in our family.\n\n\nOne of my grandparents was the eldest child in a family of 10+ kids at the time, beacuse their mom was one of those that had a child every 9 months.  They were \"in charge\" of younger siblings.  While helping put one day at the ripe old age of 12, the house caught fire.  2 younger siblings died in the fire (a 2 yo that was in a crib and a newborn).  Mom was even at home and that grandparent was \"at fault\" and blamed for the 2 kids deaths.  This grandparent saved their 4yo and 1 yo siblings and the older ones got out on their own or were saved by other siblings.  My grandparent was ALWAYS at fault for this.  I was told stories about it growing up about how they \"let them burn to death\".  Mind you I was 12 years old and was like, who the hell puts a kid in charge at 12!  \n\nMy take away was that it is not only child abuse, it setting them up for lifelong pain and suffering if something does go wrong.  \n\nSo NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The ten year old may not alert a parent to a dangerous situation due to fear of \u201cgetting in trouble\u201d and not having the maturity to recognize how dangerous a situation may be.
