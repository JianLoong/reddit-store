You said \"no\". For two weeks your aunt, your uncle and your mother fought that \"no\" and then ignored it. Then they were surprised and enraged when your \"no\" turned out to be actually real. Now the group of people who have become accustomed to ignoring your \"no\" are amping up the abuse, because if they overwhelm you into apologizing, they can go back to using you for free childcare whenever.\n\nThis is crucial: hold firm. If you roll over now, you will teach them all that calling you a whore is the new way to get you to do whatever they want. If you let them wear themselves out against your one simple \"no\", then they will take awhile, but eventually they will learn that you actually have boundaries, desires, and a life, and you deserve the basics of respect. You might have to block some of them while they scream and cry it out. It's a tantrum. I bet you've handled a few of those in your time.\n\nCongratulations on your engagement. May you build a family that respects each other's boundaries.", "NTA. Why didn\u2019t your mom, or any of siblings, or any other family member take care of the kid? Why are you the ONLY one who can take care of this baby, on your birthday no less. Delusional family.

Standing your ground and maintaining your boundaries is very healthy, and I'm glad for you. Going forward, it may be wise to limit or cut off contact with these people as they clearly do not value or respect you. You've found someone who does. Go with them, and best of luck!\n\nDefinitely NTA", ">I am the eldest child on both sides of a large family. Five siblings and ten aunts and uncles (5 on each side) who had at least 4 kids each.\n\nYeah, NTA. \n\nIf I was OP I would be appalled that not one of them was willing and able to provide child care. In your situation I would respond to every attack from them by loudly and aggressively asking why they hate their family so much that they continually refuse to help even one single time and how astonished and ashamed YOU are at THEIR horrifically  callous behavior. Go on the offensive and call them out for their refusal to do the bare minimum to support their family after you have done so countless times.", "NTA.   Your family sucks.   Your mom especially, for telling them you would do it.   She did this move out and stuff because she is used to manipulating people.   Good on you for not letting her manipulate you.", "NTA. Your family is a total disaster area. Why on earth didn't any of the people who are screaming at you now just babysit the kid instead?", " Your family is you and your fianc\u00e9. Full stop.", "NTA, let the bridge you burn light your way to go no contact with everyone but your Dad.", "NTA. \nYour family sounds incredibly toxic and honestly sounds like they should be adopting anyone\u2019s child if this is how they act. Why couldn\u2019t your mother watch them? You clearly already had plans and you are under no obligation to cancel your plans to do favors for others.", "Very obviously NTA.", "Completely NTA\n\n Your family is for dumping kids onto you to babysit", "Nta. Take this opportunity to RUN from this side of your family.", "NTA, and kudos for maintaining your boundaries. You haven't done *anything* wrong here. \n\nAnd congratulations on your engagement!", "NTA at all! Why couldn't your mother watch him? Or any of the other relatives who are so quick to blame you?", "Huge NTA. So sorry for your shitty unsupportive family. TG your father is there for you. Congratulations on your engagement. Please update if you go LC or NC.", "NTA. the only criticism i would give you is you needed to stand up for yourself way earlier. You are not your families on call babysitter and this needed to be stopped way before this nonsense as it has clearly gotten way out of hand. How in the hell were you magically the only person in your mothers family that could watch the baby when you already had birthday plans? the answer is you weren't you were the first call they made and your mother was the second. \n\nThe fact that your mothers family went so ballistic at you saying no for once seems to speak of much deeper problems and those have been covered up in part by you being the permanent babysitter for the younger generations entire lives. \n\nIf they are so incapable of finding a carer for the baby besides you a person that said no makes me honestly side with the bio grandparents in the custody case and also speaks badly about the rest of your family that none of them were willing to say 'O i could do that from X-Y time and A can join me half way through and take over till you get back'. What was there plan if you were away and they need a carer for the child?", "NTA your family is huge someone else could watch the kid", "NTA. It might be different if this was an emergency. Empathically: the only reason it was an emergency is because they decided to make your reasonable refusal into a power move, and now they're mad their stupid decision blew up in their face. They had two weeks to find somebody else to handle this! Two weeks!", "Definitely NTA. As you said you have a big family so why couldn\u2019t they ask anyone else in the family to babysit? Why do they act as if it is your obligation? The entitlement is unbelievable. \nAlso, congratulations on your proposal", "NTA. Sounds to me like you got a lot of messages from a whole lot of people who could've done the babysitting if they were that concerned about the adoption.", "NTA - time to shrink your family by a lot. Same for your dad.", "Everybody said all my reasons already so I'll just leave another NTA.", "So NTA. And since its been 3 years since Ryan passed, those calling you a whore need to be at the top of your list to deal with. I'm glad you have such support in setting boundaries, and may I suggest as an exercise in that, a good idea might be to write each of those calling you that a letter calling them out for their hypocrisy if they are so religious. Remind them that your vows were until death do you part, and you are not obligated to be alone for them or anyone, nor do they own you or your time. remind them that Jesus forbade his followers from calling women such names, and maybe they need to reread their bibles since they have apparently missed so much. And finally that since they cannot keep a civil tone with you, you will no longer be talking to any of them without a full apology in front of the family.\n   Go for broke. Make their heads explode. You may find it quite the catharsis.", "NTA time to cut every one off. Something you should have corrected a long time ago.

If you decide to get married without them, expect a new round of abuse (they will have deserved the exclusion, but they\u2019ll have another tantrum over it).  I, personally, would exclude the specific people who called you names in their anger.  When a new boundary is being set, the general anger and frustration can be expected, but when people cross the line from being angry at your choices to calling you vile names and insulting you personally, that\u2019s when they don\u2019t deserve a place at the table any more.  IMO, those people should not be invited to the wedding; by extension, they have insulted Alex as well.  If that includes your mother, I am so sorry.\n\nYou are not responsible for managing their feelings, but you can manage your own response and you can exact consequences to anyone who crossed the line in attacking your character through insults and name calling.\n\nIt goes without saying that you should not be available to help any of them (except your dad) with anything until further notice, and perhaps permanently.  Do reach out to your dad.  His support of you is costing him a lot.  He needs to know he is not alone.  If you have space for him to come stay with you a couple of days, invite him over.  If not, take him to dinner.\n\nNTA", "NTA.", "Tough situation all around but you didn\u2019t destroy your parents marriage. That\u2019s on them.

OP, I would text everyone, \"Based on all these angry messages and calls, it's clear that the years I've spent babysitting for free and helping with the kids at events hasn't been appreciated. I said no to a babysitting day for two weeks leading up to the date, and then people still felt entitled enough to show up with the child, and refuse to leave. People then felt entitled enough to insult me and harass me because I wasn't available to watch someone ONE day. Therefore, I will never watch any of your children again. If the only reason we had a relationship was so that I could be free childcare, I guess this is the end of our relationship. If you actually cared about me as a person, I'll see you at the next family event. Either way, the next time I receive a harassing call or text, I'll be blocking people and moving on with my life.\"", "You seem to know what you\u2019re talking about.

That\u2019s rare and wonderful!\n\nIn such a big family there was definitely someone else who could have watched the baby and they cannot thrust everything on you.

The issue between your mother and father is not your fault, it is your mother's fault for being in the wrong and not backing down.
