You can do what you want and have anyone live there that you want.\n\nHere's the thing: Your great-grandma, in her generosity to you, also set up a weird power dynamic in your family. You, at a very young age, had control over something most teens don't have control over - the place the family lives.\n\nI understand why your dad was upset when you said he couldn't move in his girlfriend and her family. You could control something most kids don't get to control. Most kids don't want to live with a new step family without a lot of easing into it. Most kids don't get a say about though. And, OP, I'm so sorry your dad abandoned you after that. He gets the AH award for that.\n\nNTA", "Hared NTA\n\nFirst and foremost, your dad has problems with boundaries.  He has women over while you are still a teenager.  I do not even want to imagine how awkward those breakfasts were and inappropriate to expose his daughter to this.\n\nSecondly, you never met your future stepsiblings. and your dad does not even ask your opinion let alone permission and tells you they are moving in! UGH! Kudos to your great gran.\n\nI can see why your parents got divorced.  He informs and does not even bother to ask anyone how they feel when he makes big decisions that affect them.\n\nYour mom's stepfamily is totally different. They have a relationship with you and you like them.  Totally understandable why they were invited to move in with you. You invited them! \n\nIf your grown father cannot see the difference, you need to sit him down and treat him like the ten-year-old he is.  Explain step by step the difference and why it is not the same.  End it with, my house, my rules, my choice.", "NTA\n\nIt's literally YOUR house. You decide who belongs, and who doesn't.

Your GGM. \n\nHear me out. \n\nInstead of letting her inheritance flow through normal procedure, she passed your dad (her own grandchild), and gifted you a house. So to you, she's definitely not an AH, it's an amazing gift, but it did create a weird power dynamic between you and your dad, which she chose. \n\nParents of under age children make decisions for them, and suddenly the child has the power to make a life altering decision for the parent. That's a guarantee for disaster, as you've experienced.\n\nYour dad is her own blood, even more than you, and giving him the house would have prevented this power dynamic. The power dynamic wasn't problematic for years, because it was invisible, when all of you were aligned in vision. For almost 20 years.\n\nNow moving in new people without the consent of every person living there is an AH move, even when the house would have been his. So it that, your dad is the AH.\n\nHe doesn't deserve the house, it's yours, but he does deserve compassion. He took care of you for years, and you returned the favor by evicted him. Within your rights, and for good reasons, but still, you evicted him. Not an AH move on your part, he forced your hand, but very very harsh. \n\nI think he could accept the harshness with the narrative \"she's now grown up, and wants to live independently\", but struggles with the \"well, she likes living with her mothers family more, she's choosing them over me\". Which is... Understandable. \n\nWere you the AH? I'd say no. Does he deserve compassion for his anger? Yes, yes he does. He got served a lot of harsh truths.", "Exactly.  You were introduced to your mom's new husband and her surprise. You got along and formed a relationship with them.\n\nYour dads new wife was virtually a stranger  and you never met her kids. \n\nTotally different. \n\nNTA", "Unfortunatley the only things my dad says to me this days is that i stole his house and his inheritance, after GGM left me what my father was supposed to get. It's really sad, I was his mini me, we used to be so close.", "She was the most badass woman ever, she got divorced in the 50s and worked hard to provide for her daughter and her grandchildren, and then me, I'm her only greatgrandchild, my aunt didn't had kids.\n\nWhile panicking I actually called my cousin(on mom's side)/best friend and she told me to call her, I was losing my mind cause he also wanted me to give up my room, and move to the smaller one since I was gonna go to university soon.", "They actually divorced because my dad didn't want to work more then 4 hours a day(and it wasn't to take care of me) and GGM kinda enable him and gave him money when he asked, but that then backfired because in her will states that all the money she gave him was take out of his inheritance.", "Dad also said I had to gave up my room, originally was a 4 bedroom house, master, then 2 equal size bedrooms and an smaller one, like half the size of the other two, he said that since I was going to go to university soon a didn't need the space, even tho I told him I was going to one that's here and I didn't want to live in a dorm.", "GGM begged my mom to let her help her with me, they got along great, mom was in the rotation taking care of her in her last days since GGM didn't want strangers.", "Honesty, growing up I think I loved my dad more cause even though his music on 24/7 was annoying it meant he was home more than mom, but it was because GGM subsided his lifestyle.\n\nAlso the biggest issue was that my dad basically told me that he wanted my relationship with Clarie and her kids to be just like my relationship with my stepdad and his kids minus the 12 years for it to become what it is today", "Which one are you? Dad? Stepmum or step-siblings OP never met?", "The house was always yours, your GGM bought it for you", "I\u2019m a little petty, I\u2019d remind him he chose a new family over you/GGM and that\u2019s his consequences if he keeps that crap up. Also it was never \u201chis\u201d unless he planned on taking over when GGM passed. I hope everything works out eventually op <3 family drama sucks", "That is genius!", "He chose a new family over her?\n\nWhat? Her dad stayed single for 9 years raising her.

He left her for the new family", "NTA\n\n\nYour house your rules. PERIOT!", "NTA. First, your grandma had to tell you that the girl dad brought over more than once was his girlfriend. Second your GGM TOLD your dad what was up. He can't say you 'stole' his inheritance when he knew from pregnancy that the house was yours.", "Your dad handled introducing his new partner to you poorly.\nHe just assumed dropping new people into your space will go smoothly and unchallenged.\nAnd then when he didn't get his way he dismissed and abandoned your relationship.\nInstead of working on building bridges he torched them.\n\nIt was bought with you in mind. Probably GGM had good insight to your parents and father personality as responsible adult and found him lacking. So she overruled and over run him so she'll know you are taken cared of.\nBless her.\n\nIf he can't rise up and see you ,\nYou don't owe him your comfort and you shouldn't deny yourself your mother's and siblings company.\n\nNta\n\nEdit\nRead other comments and your dad is a deadbeat who is used to living on other peoples dime.\nHe seems lazy, childish and selfish.\nI get why you thought he was a great dad when you were a kid because he was a kid too that didn't grow up.\nHe is angry at you because he ran out of funds when GGM died and you blocked him from cashing on your property.\nGood riddance.\nYour mom seem awesome follow her lead and get rid of the deadbeat dad.", "NTA. The difference is that your stepmom is a stranger to you while your stepdad isn't.", "NAH but i understand your father frustration", "NTA. You own the house? Then you get to say who does, or does not get to live there. Ignore those who tell you different.", "NTA... 12 years ago you got a step dad and step brothers. 2 years ago when your basically an adult your dad started dating someone and got married to her in the last 2 years. You don't want these random people who have came in so late to your life to live with you but are ok with people living with you that you've had around for 2/3rds of your life and somehow your getting botched at. Tell them to kick rocks. It's your house and you want your family to live with you not some random people", "Please read OP's comments, and even their first statement on the post.\n\nGGM bought the house *for OP*. Period. And she did it knowing how OP's dad was - he decided unilaterally to cut down his working hours to 4, never intending to spend that extra time with his own child. After the divorce, he kept asking GGM for money.\n\nThe 'power dynamic' you speak of would cause OP to be kicked out of their own room in favour of dad's stepkids, which OP had never met. \n\nFinally, he didn't take care of OP for years. When moving his GF so early in the relationship was refused, he moved out. OP did *not* evict their dad. And it was GGM's idea for OP to have their mom close, since she was one of the people who helped take care of GGM in her final days.\n\nNo. Dad does not deserve compassion. He is angry just because he feels entitled to the house - which GGM never intended for him to have, and he knew it.", "Nobody evicted him, I went to my mom's a few days later, the following week when i came back to the house the couch was gone, the living room tv was gone, and a bunch of stuff was gone too, i thought we were robbed or something, but then my room was intact, I called him multiple times and he didn't pick up then a called my grandma and she told me he moved out. GGM told him he could stay in the house but couldn't force anyone else in.\n\nThe whole power dynamic kinda comes from the fact that when GGM bought a house for my grandparent when the got married my grandpa tried to sell it but it was in GGM's name, she was angry, said she bought the house so her daugther and her grandkids have a place to live. For what I know my dad also tried to sell this house after the divored but GGM didn't allow him.", "Uh oh, no. You've said it on your opening sentence: GGM bought the house *for you*. Not for your dad. It was never *his house* or *his inheritance* to claim. Your GGM never intended for him to get that house and she made it clear.\n\nHe is now trying to gaslighting you in an attempt to strong arm you against GGM's will and your well being.\n\nKeep that in mind and don't give in.\n\nBest of luck, OP. You're NTA.\n\nETA: Your friend is not you and they didn't grow up living with your family on either side, so their opinion is moot. They can (as people say in my country) put their guitar in the bag and go play elsewhere.\n\nYour grandparents have no say either. Ignore them, for the sake of your mental tranquility.", "i mean, how you didnt expect this to happen", "That\u2019s not clears it sounds like dad stayed in the house alone and OP went back and forth between parents. Mom moved on a year later and dad waits until OP is almost an adult."]}
