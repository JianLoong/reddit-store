Your GGM. \n\nHear me out. \n\nInstead of letting her inheritance flow through normal procedure, she passed your dad (her own grandchild), and gifted you a house. So to you, she's definitely not an AH, it's an amazing gift, but it did create a weird power dynamic between you and your dad, which she chose. \n\nParents of under age children make decisions for them, and suddenly the child has the power to make a life altering decision for the parent. That's a guarantee for disaster, as you've experienced.\n\nYour dad is her own blood, even more than you, and giving him the house would have prevented this power dynamic. The power dynamic wasn't problematic for years, because it was invisible, when all of you were aligned in vision. For almost 20 years.\n\nNow moving in new people without the consent of every person living there is an AH move, even when the house would have been his. So it that, your dad is the AH.\n\nHe doesn't deserve the house, it's yours, but he does deserve compassion. He took care of you for years, and you returned the favor by evicted him. Within your rights, and for good reasons, but still, you evicted him. Not an AH move on your part, he forced your hand, but very very harsh. \n\nI think he could accept the harshness with the narrative \"she's now grown up, and wants to live independently\", but struggles with the \"well, she likes living with her mothers family more, she's choosing them over me\". Which is... Understandable. \n\nWere you the AH? I'd say no. Does he deserve compassion for his anger? Yes, yes he does. He got served a lot of harsh truths.", "Exactly.

After the divorce, he kept asking GGM for money.\n\nThe 'power dynamic' you speak of would cause OP to be kicked out of their own room in favour of dad's stepkids, which OP had never met. \n\nFinally, he didn't take care of OP for years. When moving his GF so early in the relationship was refused, he moved out. OP did *not* evict their dad. And it was GGM's idea for OP to have their mom close, since she was one of the people who helped take care of GGM in her final days.\n\nNo. Dad does not deserve compassion. He is angry just because he feels entitled to the house - which GGM never intended for him to have, and he knew it.", "Nobody evicted him, I went to my mom's a few days later, the following week when i came back to the house the couch was gone, the living room tv was gone, and a bunch of stuff was gone too, i thought we were robbed or something, but then my room was intact, I called him multiple times and he didn't pick up then a called my grandma and she told me he moved out. GGM told him he could stay in the house but couldn't force anyone else in.\n\nThe whole power dynamic kinda comes from the fact that when GGM bought a house for my grandparent when the got married my grandpa tried to sell it but it was in GGM's name, she was angry, said she bought the house so her daugther and her grandkids have a place to live. For what I know my dad also tried to sell this house after the divored but GGM didn't allow him.", "Uh oh, no. You've said it on your opening sentence: GGM bought the house *for you*. Not for your dad. It was never *his house* or *his inheritance* to claim. Your GGM never intended for him to get that house and she made it clear.\n\nHe is now trying to gaslighting you in an attempt to strong arm you against GGM's will and your well being.\n\nKeep that in mind and don't give in.\n\nBest of luck, OP. You're NTA.\n\nETA: Your friend is not you and they didn't grow up living with your family on either side, so their opinion is moot.

I understand that you panicked over your father moving in people you didn't know to your house. That's ok. But since then, have you tried to get to know them? Your father isn't entitled to your house, but I understand that he feels like he's being treated unfairly. This is something you need to talk through with your dad, why you took the decision you made and that by no means you meant to be unfair and there's nothing against his new family. \n\nYour father isn't an AH, he's just hurt (so far). He's not entitled to your house, that's 100% your choice, but that doesn't mean you should just tell him to \"suck it up\".

He totally botched the merging of families in a very bad way.   \n\n\nHowever, I can see why he feels the way he feels. It's 100% true that he got passed over when it comes to inheritance. Not only that, he felt totally replaced because the ex-wife then moved in. So, now he gets his ex-wife and her new guy (did they divorce because of this guy?) living in a house bought with his grandmother's money. That is screwed up in more ways than one.   \n\n\nThe daughter apparently didn't even realize that this would be an issue.
