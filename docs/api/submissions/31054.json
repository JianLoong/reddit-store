The lines between friendship and caregiving blurred, leading to a codependent dynamic. I started cooking, cleaning, and supporting her through work and her problems with her relationship every night which started to drain me.\n\nEven though I promised to live with her, I told her three months prior to the lease renewal that I was thinking about moving to another city for personal growth.

She was going to renew the lease but then had to quit her job for ER visits, and then wasn\u2019t able to find a roommate.Because I was apartment searching and busy with travel, I wasn\u2019t able to help support her through those challenges. She asked me to not see my partner so I could be at home in case she needed to go to the ER. I switched around plans with friends to sleep at the apartment. I didn't want to but offered to help her with financial assistance for a hotel to stay a few nights, or to pay for therapy sessions.\n\nThe week I was going to move out, she called me crying that she wasn\u2019t able to find a place to stay and if she could crash at my place. She didn\u2019t say when she was going to leave. A few months ago, I had told her I would be open to living together in my new city - but this was before I realized how much she needed from me. I am not qualified to be a caregiver and can't keep rearranging my schedule.I told her that she could not stay at my place. \n\nWhile she was crying, I said I didn\u2019t feel comfortable housing her with no end date and I was feeling overwhelmed and I needed to take care of myself. She said OK and then hung up the phone. I've tried to reach out to see how she's doing but she doesn't respond. We don't talk anymore and I don't know how to make up with her. I am afraid if she is back in my life she will ask me for more. She used to have unlimited access to me because we lived together but truthfully, I went past my capacity to help her with her problems when I needed that time to be alone.

I understand that your friend is disabled and in bad health condition and in despair because she doesn't know where to go but i\u2018d be curious if she realizes how much you did for her? Essentially being her care taker\u2026 thats a lot and you went over your own capacities, does she realize how many of your own needs you set aside to help her? Friends should help each other but there has to be Limits even if its hurtful\n\nWhat WOULD be other options for her OP? Does she have other friends/relatives? Will she be truly homeless on the streets now? What is the exact situation", "NTA\n\nYou have already gone above and beyond normal to take care of your friend. It was especially bad that you would cancel meeting with your significant other, just in case your friend needed something from the ER. This is not healthy boundaries anymore. I recommend you look inside and try to figure out why you feel responsible for other people's emotions. Do you only see yourself valuable when you can be of use to someone? I would be very careful not to become a caretaker to ANYBODY from now on - including your partner. Because it seems that you have that tendency. Usually there are some underlying self-worth issues when this happens to this extent.\n\nConsider yourself lucky that you now do not have this unhealthy bond with your friend. Everyone has moments when they need extra support, but long term things should be pretty equal. You're not a therapist, you are a friend. You are not a nurse - nurses get paid. You need to live your own life.\n\nWhatever you do, never, ever, offer this person a place to stay. You take too much responsibility for other people and will never get rid of them, if they were to move in - even for a few days.", "NTA. It's hard but if you give they will take and ask more. This is not the solution. She needs to find something that is ling term that doesnt drain you. \nFeel good about what you did. That was charitable and something you should feel proud of", "NTA, you\u2019re not her carer and you\u2019ve already gone well above and beyond for her."]}
