Your cleavage has absolutely no effect on them, and you're old enough to understand what meanings various clothing has when you wear them. So go express yourself. \n\nTwo things though - first if the problem is simply that you have big breasts which mean you magically have cleavage for relatively high-necked clothes, be aware that dealing with that crap will probably follow you your whole life. \n\nTwo - if this really is a scapegoat/golden child situation, then I strongly encourage you to get therapy and reduce your contact with your parents. Do a bit of research, see if you feel like it fits, if you frequently bear guilt or responsibility for things that aught to be on your parents. If you've grown up with this dynamic you'll have all sorts of toxic beliefs and negative coping skills baked into your personality, and unpacking them is going to be hard.\n\nI'm I terrible for sincerely hoping that you're just someone who's going to have lower back problems soon?", "NTA.

I apologised but couldn\u2019t as I had no other clothes with me and pointed out I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d be there because all her friends were 15+ and I didn\u2019t know she was letting him stay. Then a girl who I actually didn\u2019t get on with but was in \u2018our group\u2019 pointed out that A) 13 year olds don\u2019t need therapy from seeing cleavage and B) Her 17 year old boyfriend was looking too and that was more likely the issue. He wasn\u2019t hitting on me or being sleazy but she may have just been resentful.\n\nI was also slut-shamed for wearing a dress that showed some cleavage and was above the knee at another friend\u2019s 17th (she had said any dress of any length would be fine) even though I was wearing thick black tights.

Judgmental and early favoritism from parents being voiced out loud and pushed upon someone who doesn't deserve it.\n\nYour mom doesn't like your size? Too damn bad, you were born  that way, and she should be haply since she had a hand in making that. Which sounds worse than I intended. Just wanted her to be happy you were her daughter and healthy.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re a grownup who presumably does not live with them and it is none of their business.", "NTA. Your sister has it easy telling you to avoid conflicts if your parents never started anything like this with her.", "NTA. I'm a mom of teens, including an adult teen. I'm telling you your parents and your sister have the wrong perspectives.\n\nYou are 22 yo! Your parents shared their opinion with you. You gave it the consideration you wanted to and made your own decision. You handled things perfectly. Your parents need to learn that they should (1) limit what they offer their unsolicited opinions on (I admit I still do that some, but I'm doing it much less. By the time my kid is 23, I don't expect to be offering unsolicited opinions almost at all.) and (2) that you are an adult free to make your own choices and live with your own consequences. Yes, you do owe consideration to the impact of your choices on others, but you also have to recognize when people are investing too much into your life.\n\nYour sister needs to learn that giving into other's expectations to \"avoid unnecessary conflict\" will lead her to giving up a lot of her autonomy. Sometimes conflict IS necessary to establish/maintain your boundaries and autonomy. Figuring out the balance is not simple, but it is part of being an adult.", "NTA\nYour parents raised you to be ashamed of your body. That's grossly unfair. They are the ones who need to issue an apology . And at 22 you should be wearing what you feel good in, not what somebody else tells you to wear.", "NTA. You are an adult and not living at home. Your parents have no say in what you wear.", "NTA. You are a grown up woman, I am assuming living outside of your parents home which doesn't matter, you get to choose what you want to wear. If you want to wear pasties and a G-string to grannies bar mitzvah that's your decision.", "NTA. I suspect you've got a GC/SG dynamic going, & the way you dress is but one facet of it.\n\nYou're an adult, not a child. If your ass wasn't showing & your breasts falling out the top, they need to get over themselves.\n\nYour dress sounds like one I wish I could wear (curves in the lower part, but not enough up top to balance).", "OP, I would just stop this tradition. Stop showing your mom and sister what you're wearing beforehand, that way you won't have this problem.", "OP needs to make sure she is seeing what her mom is going to wear next time and everything she shows her call it dowdy. Other words work as well but go with the old lady theme.\n\nNTA", "As someone one with the big breasts, often having a v cut or lower open neck (like undoing another button on a button up) makes it less obvious because there's nothing straining against the top of the blouse.\n\nNTA it's a party, OP go ahead and put your best \"foot\" forward!", "This!!!  Absolutely keep dropping that word until they realize how creepy they've been to you.  NTA and glad you've been able to move out!", "Yes! send them a long text about how disappointed YOU are OP", "Or just exclude Mom and make sure sister is aware in case of any blowback."]}
