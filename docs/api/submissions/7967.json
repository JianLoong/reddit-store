Your cleavage has absolutely no effect on them, and you're old enough to understand what meanings various clothing has when you wear them. So go express yourself. \n\nTwo things though - first if the problem is simply that you have big breasts which mean you magically have cleavage for relatively high-necked clothes, be aware that dealing with that crap will probably follow you your whole life. \n\nTwo - if this really is a scapegoat/golden child situation, then I strongly encourage you to get therapy and reduce your contact with your parents. Do a bit of research, see if you feel like it fits, if you frequently bear guilt or responsibility for things that aught to be on your parents. If you've grown up with this dynamic you'll have all sorts of toxic beliefs and negative coping skills baked into your personality, and unpacking them is going to be hard.\n\nI'm I terrible for sincerely hoping that you're just someone who's going to have lower back problems soon?", "NTA.

I apologised but couldn\u2019t as I had no other clothes with me and pointed out I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d be there because all her friends were 15+ and I didn\u2019t know she was letting him stay. Then a girl who I actually didn\u2019t get on with but was in \u2018our group\u2019 pointed out that A) 13 year olds don\u2019t need therapy from seeing cleavage and B) Her 17 year old boyfriend was looking too and that was more likely the issue. He wasn\u2019t hitting on me or being sleazy but she may have just been resentful.\n\nI was also slut-shamed for wearing a dress that showed some cleavage and was above the knee at another friend\u2019s 17th (she had said any dress of any length would be fine) even though I was wearing thick black tights.

Just wanted her to be happy you were her daughter and healthy.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re a grownup who presumably does not live with them and it is none of their business.", "NTA. Your sister has it easy telling you to avoid conflicts if your parents never started anything like this with her.", "NTA. I'm a mom of teens, including an adult teen. I'm telling you your parents and your sister have the wrong perspectives.\n\nYou are 22 yo! Your parents shared their opinion with you. You gave it the consideration you wanted to and made your own decision. You handled things perfectly. Your parents need to learn that they should (1) limit what they offer their unsolicited opinions on (I admit I still do that some, but I'm doing it much less. By the time my kid is 23, I don't expect to be offering unsolicited opinions almost at all.) and (2) that you are an adult free to make your own choices and live with your own consequences. Yes, you do owe consideration to the impact of your choices on others, but you also have to recognize when people are investing too much into your life.\n\nYour sister needs to learn that giving into other's expectations to \"avoid unnecessary conflict\" will lead her to giving up a lot of her autonomy. Sometimes conflict IS necessary to establish/maintain your boundaries and autonomy. Figuring out the balance is not simple, but it is part of being an adult.", "NTA\nYour parents raised you to be ashamed of your body. That's grossly unfair. They are the ones who need to issue an apology . And at 22 you should be wearing what you feel good in, not what somebody else tells you to wear.", "NTA. You are an adult and not living at home. Your parents have no say in what you wear.", "NTA. You are a grown up woman, I am assuming living outside of your parents home which doesn't matter, you get to choose what you want to wear. If you want to wear pasties and a G-string to grannies bar mitzvah that's your decision.", "NTA. I suspect you've got a GC/SG dynamic going, & the way you dress is but one facet of it.\n\nYou're an adult, not a child. If your ass wasn't showing & your breasts falling out the top, they need to get over themselves.\n\nYour dress sounds like one I wish I could wear (curves in the lower part, but not enough up top to balance).", "OP, I would just stop this tradition. Stop showing your mom and sister what you're wearing beforehand, that way you won't have this problem.", "OP needs to make sure she is seeing what her mom is going to wear next time and everything she shows her call it dowdy. Other words work as well but go with the old lady theme.\n\nNTA", "As someone one with the big breasts, often having a v cut or lower open neck (like undoing another button on a button up) makes it less obvious because there's nothing straining against the top of the blouse.\n\nNTA it's a party, OP go ahead and put your best \"foot\" forward!", "This!!!  Absolutely keep dropping that word until they realize how creepy they've been to you.  NTA and glad you've been able to move out!", "Yes! send them a long text about how disappointed YOU are OP", "Or just exclude Mom and make sure sister is aware in case of any blowback.", "NTA. first of all, you're a functioning adult, who doesn't have to ponder to their wishes anymore. second of all, this is ridiculous: they are definitely projecting something and the way they pick your sister over you because you're not *petite*?... yikes.  \n\n\nalso i think your sister could be more supportive. i'm glad she's living her best life, yeah, but how about having empathy for her own sibling who is being treated poorly for *nothing*? esh but you, op, i hope you won't have to deal with bullshit like this anymore.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult, it\u2019s your body, it\u2019s your life. Wear whatever you want. If it makes you happy that\u2019s all that matters.", "NTA Its time to stop this unhealthy tradition, considering the control they had when you lived with them.", "NTA. \n\nIf your parents wanted to avoid conflict, they could have just, you know, not told another adult what to wear.", "YTA\n\nIs it really that difficult to respect your really simple wishes of your parents? FFS\n\nSome of you guys are so disrespectful and difficult out of spite for no good reason", "NTA. Don\u2019t ever let anyone make you feel ashamed of your body. \u201cFlashy figure\u201d, WTF does that even mean. Ugh.", "NTA your parents are body shaming you because you don\u2019t look like a boy. Wear what you want if they don\u2019t like you to dress like woman  they shouldn\u2019t invite you", "NTA. Your parents are sexist, body-shaming assholes.", "NTA, your parents sound insufferable", "NTA. So much not the AH, OP. \n\nYour mum is an AH though for trying to police what you wear because you aren't skinny. Honestly as long as no one can see your private parts than they should shut up... (obviously it's nice to get an honest opinion if a shape or colour etc doesn't suit you, but not with the intention to shame your figure). \n\nBodyshaming is out and I congratulate you on standing up for yourself. The compliments you got speak for themselves and the only disappointment here is your mum. \n\nAnd please don't shut up for peace sake. That's how narcisists, racists, sexist etc. are enabled to spread their hate with little consequences. Trying to shame you for who you are, is part of this, as it's intended to either keep you small or prevent others (here your mum) to adress uncomfortable feelings about themselves. This problem only exists in your mum's head, it's on her to work through it. You do not need to cover up just because you're not thin or because your mum doesn't like it. You don't owe her to dress in a way she approves off.\n\nWear that dress. And wear it with confidence. I am sure you looked fab in it, all the compliments you got are proof!", "It\u2019s 2023. NTA.", "You are NTA & neither is your sister, but she's wrong: this is a very necessary conflict.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with your body, no matter what shape you are. Your parents have wrongly, misguidedly raised you to believe that because of your body type, you should cover up & not call attention to yourself. It's probably taught you to lose confidence & self-esteem & feel that your body isn't good enough. That's backwards assholery and it was high time you stood up to their absurd views.\n\nYou wear that dress proudly, cuz as they say, \"If you got it, flaunt it.\"\n\nTell your parents that it's you who's disappointed in them for making you feel like there is something wrong with your body when they should have realized that there is no one right body type & should have been making you feel proud & confident about yourself.", "NTA. she really cant see the clear double standard coming straight out of her mouth?", "NTA but doing facetime calls to review outfits with someone who criticises your figure and your outfit choices is a recipe for disaster, you're inviting her comments.", "NTA- no body shaming allowed.", "You are 22. You are old enough to dress yourself. NTA Stop calling and showing what you are wearing", "NTA Your sister is right, though, in that it\u2019s an unnecessary argument. She should tell her parents that to shut them up. OP, you do you- i bet you looked fantastic! Your body isn\u2019t shameful for just being!", "NO, that is not what they are saying.  Her parents are saying she is too FAT to wear the dress.  OP is nta, the parents are.  They have apparently treated her like this her whole life.  OP take a stand, live your life and be yourself.  I'm sure you looked beautiful.", "This. My life improved so much when I stopped running my wardrobe choices past my mom ahead of family events. \n\n\u201cIs THAT what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d \n\n\u2026Uh, yes, I\u2019m literally wearing it, why do you ask?", "My experience was that it wasn\u2019t ever obvious enough or done in view of the men who would have defended me. It was stuff like creepy stares.", "NTA. Your parents are. It's ok for your not so curvey sister to a short dress, but not you? I'm calling BS. They raised you better? Better than what? A bologna sandwich. Cause there's a crap ton of bologna in that line of thinking. \n\nThey are disappointed in you? What about how disappointed you are in in them? That they can actually look you in eyes with straight face feed such an enormous line of shit and expect you to buy into it? You are a little girl anymore. You are not going to cower to condescending and deeming remarks by people who have clearly have an agenda. \n\nIf they are embarrassed, that's on them. You are not responsible for how they feel. They are. If don't like what they see, they can look elsewhere or stay home. You are PROUD of yourself, not embarrassed. You don't have plans to hide yourself.", "You are old enough to dress yourself.", "NTA. It's not like you attended in a stripper outfit for provocation. What your parents are doing is nothing but slut-shaming and guilt-tripping. Not to mention the body-shaming attempt with this nonsense about your \"petite\" sister and your \"flashy curves\". Appears to me as if your Parents are actually the only ones sexualizing your appearance. Yikes.\n\nEdited for judgement.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents policing your clothing due to your body type is all kinds of messed up.", ">Okay so I (22f) was invited to a big family gathering (kind of a party when you think of it) at my aunts house to celebrate my cousin\u2019s graduation. \n\nDoes you mother believe you're trying to seduce one of your family members?\n\nYou didn't wear the dress to spite them. You wore it so you could enjoy yourself without having to act the part of your mother's dress-up doll.\n\nNTA. \n\nHere are three steps your mother can use to get past the fact you can wear whatever you want:\n\n1. Cry me a river.\n\n2. Build a bridge.\n\n3. And get the F*CK over it!", "NTA\n\nYour parents are body shaming you. Not okay.", "NTA\n\nTell your parents you are going to dress as you please. Your mother needs to stop being jealous of your body.", "They said she has \"a flashy figure\". They think she's too voluptuous, not too fat.", "She is, my mom and sister have the same body type I\u2019m more like my dad\u2019s side of the family so kinda the odd one out.", "Oh lord same. Though since my mom bought my clothes through high school, it was generally while clothing shopping. Corn-fed midwestern girl of german descent, yeah, I'm built on a different scale than the average person and anything other than mom jeans and oversized shirts was \"too revealing\" or just got that \\*look\\*. I learned to keep my mouth shut and didn't get any clothing that showed I had a figure until college. As a middle age adult, I still get a reduced version of \"the look\" but at least she keeps her opinion to herself."]}
