It's time your parents respect your decisions.\n\nI for one, would have worn something even tinier just to spite them.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds to me like one of two things - either you've got big breasts that are being oversexualized *because*, or you're a scapegoat who will never make your parents happy. \n\nEither way, wear what makes you comfortable. Your cleavage has absolutely no effect on them, and you're old enough to understand what meanings various clothing has when you wear them. So go express yourself. \n\nTwo things though - first if the problem is simply that you have big breasts which mean you magically have cleavage for relatively high-necked clothes, be aware that dealing with that crap will probably follow you your whole life. \n\nTwo - if this really is a scapegoat/golden child situation, then I strongly encourage you to get therapy and reduce your contact with your parents. Do a bit of research, see if you feel like it fits, if you frequently bear guilt or responsibility for things that aught to be on your parents. If you've grown up with this dynamic you'll have all sorts of toxic beliefs and negative coping skills baked into your personality, and unpacking them is going to be hard.\n\nI'm I terrible for sincerely hoping that you're just someone who's going to have lower back problems soon?", "NTA. Are they trying to suggest those attending (who are all family members) are sexualising you when they see your figure? That's pretty gross. Your body, your choice. It's not like it was a wake, it was a party!", "NTA- unfortunately you are getting what l call big girl fouls. Like you- I have curves. Started growing them young. My sister had a dancer/athlete build in a petite package. \n\nMy mother, like yours, could not handle it. The idea that her baby was maturing into someone other people might want to bang made her apoplectic. These were her hang ups. And your moms hang ups don\u2019t need to be passed on to you. \n\nThe answer: find your style and tell your family your choice in clothes is no longer up for discussion. \n\nLearn what looks good on you away from their influence. There are all sorts of stylist videos out there that can help you figure out what really works on you. It can be an emotional journey if you have been body shamed. But it\u2019s also kind of awesome too. \n\nGood luck, NTA.", "NTA your an adult, adults get to pick there outfits.", "NTA - Gee, thanks mom and dad for creating body image issues.", "I grew up in this same situation. My younger sister used to be significantly smaller than me, and was always allowed to dress as she pleased.

You're an adult. Wear what you want. When you're mom says \"i raised you better than that.\" Tell her you're sorry she didn't raise you to feel confident enough to pick out your own close sans her input,  but you're working on that.", "NTA - Telling you you can't wear something revealing when she approved of your sister because of a body size difference is TA thing to do.", "NTA.  It's OK to defy body-shaming.  Your parents are TA>", "NTA, and I think the best outcome here is that hopefully this incident will serve as the LAST time you, as an adult, EVER ask your parents to comment on your clothing choices. It's a perfect opportunity to end this video chatting \"tradition,\" now that it's caused conflict.\n\nIt sounds as if your parents raised you just fine, if you've become a mature, independent person who OWNS her fashion decisions. Wear whatever you think is appropriate -- and your parents do NOT have to like it.", "You're 22. If you chose to go out in a gold Princess Leia bikini and a cowboy hat it's none of their concern. Your parents need to accept that you're not a little girl under their control anymore. Go live your best life. NTA", "NTA. It's your own damn body and own damn clothes. Your parents are AHs for making you feel bad about showing off your body. Wear whatever your fine self wants to.", "NTA- They're jealous. If that disappointed them, then ask them did you raised me to be ashamed, insecure, and made to feel less than because of my size. Let them know you are disappointed in them.\n\nDon't always go for what may makes others comfortable if it offers you nothing.", "NTA. And good on you for wearing what you want. I've been a 'tall girl with a flashy figure' since I was 13 and often was made to feel the way you were. It sucked and I let it massively influence my self-esteem. Now I've aged out of caring and it's great. So I think you are amazing for being so self-possessed at such a young age.", "NTA. my grandma did this to me once. wore short shorts that were the exact same length as my sisters, but then she said that mine were inappropriate because my ass is bigger. such bullshit body shaming. do whatever you want", "NTA. Wear what makes you confident! You are an adult, your parents shouldn\u2019t be making weird comments about your body type / figure or the clothes you wear.", "NTA\n\nIf you are happy with the dress then that's all that matters.  Your parents need to stop thinking of you as being 12 and start thinking of you as an adult.", "NTA your an adult it\u2019s your body and honestly a bigger person than me I would\u2019ve worn a shorter dress just out of pure spite", "NTA - you are 22, the dress wasn't inappropriate so wear whatever you want.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That you won't be body shamed, be treated like a child, nor just do what someone wants to avoid them being upset.  Would she decide to avoid conflict by  protecting a person she loved, who is abusing a child?\"\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if your mom is venting to her, and she doesn't want to hear it from her, nor does she want to support you either because your choice affected her.  However, your sister refuses to see that  her lack of defending and support for OP is essentially supporting the abuse.\n\n\n\n She should be defending you. How would she feel if mom kept on insulting her appearance and body on the regular? She has had a very different experience than you growing up,and I think you need to have a blunt conversation with her about it and tell her if she wants to know what it was like, you can go over and treat her the way ypu have for a couple hours to see how she felt.\n\n\n\nYou should go no contact with your parents.

You're AN ADULT! You can do what you want (within reason) and your outfit was reasonable for a young adult to wear. Your parents might have not liked the dress and commented that they didn't like it.

Cause her mom sounds'  controlling with a huge ego.   she chose to put OP down, told her to hide her body, but made sure to ensure the sister was always supported.  Its like she sees sister as more like her.  This isn't like you, OPs mom wasn't upset her baby was growing up.This wasn't just a teen thing. This has been happening all of OPs life, and at 32, it happened again. She doesn't want OP to shine or feel good about herself.  Her mom never got over it and expects to still have control.", "NTA  There is no reason you need to wear what anyone else wants you to wear. Not your  parents. Not your siblings.

Boundaries are needed FOR SURE. \n\nBut there is this weird thing where we hyper-sexualize women with curves and give them different sets of rules than their slimmer peers.
