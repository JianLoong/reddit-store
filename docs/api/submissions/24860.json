Some of these courses have been great, such as her initial massage training, the majority of her income comes from that, in fact the massage training cost is not included in the 6300 figure, this was  years before. Others paid events she has done are 3700 quid on a coaching course, for which she has made some money back but certainly not all. The rest is on retreats, a Tantra course and other similar events. We also had a large argument about the 3700 quid course and liquidated savings to facilitate it.\n\nAlso for context, my personal purchases are minimal, I buy a PC game probably once every 2/3 months (150 quid this year so far estimate). A nice bit of wood to do some wood work, but that's been 80 quid total this year. the only other thing is tools, but I generally use these to do things like build a wood store for the house or other things that are \"for the house\".\n\nWe discussed that any purchase over 100 pounds we would discuss first, she has just informed me that she has paid 800 towards this Cacao facilitator course and that we still need to pay the balance. Now, we are not screwed by any means, we have money in crypto and stocks, but not loads. If we needed a new car or something we could buy that if we had to. We have a \"spending\" account where we buy food and pay bills and an \"overflow\" account where we save for other events, like a holiday or a new car. Low and behold both are basically empty, 1 to 200 in each. If something breaks we need to dip into savings, taking money out of ISA's etc.\n\nWe are also renovating our house next year and have savings to do so, although we are both slightly worried about budget (me more than her obviously)\n\nI write this in a bit of a rage as I cant believe she has done this without telling me, whilst winter is coming (3 to 400 quid monthly bills last year), our overflow and spending accounts are almost empty.\n\nAm I the asshole? am I blinded by my anger? I... just don't get it, I would much rather go on a family holiday, or just have the money just in case, or invest it, or pay a bit off the mortgage. please help me understand, am I the asshole??

Get financial counselling together. And what (free?) financial literacy courses are available?   \n\nHow about her just understanding the concept of interest compounding (works negatively too ie hurts you). \n\nAccording to Einstein, \u201cCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it \u2026 he who doesn't \u2026 pays it.", "NTA. Your salary isn't high by any means and she barely brings in any income. On top of that, you have kids, a mortgage, and are renovating your home.\n\nShe has gotten far too comfortable spending money your family cannot afford to lose. \"Stocks and crypto\" can, and historically often has, drop to being worthless in the blink of an eye. She needs a major wake up call.", "NTA. \n\nYou said you guys have had the agreement that \"anything over 100 pounds, you'd discuss first\". But it sounds like she had spent a significant amount over 100 without honoring that agreement and coming to you first.  Instead, she told you AFTER she had spent it and left very little leftover. It's understandable that you might feel frustrated and a bit stressed given that she not only didn't confide in you, her ideas like you both agreed to do, but that she left little leftover when you have so many other financial obligations that you both share, for the house, the family, etc.", "NTA: UK here you don't have the income for that rubbish. She's spending everything she earns. Honestly I would separate at least your savings account from now on. EDIT - just googled Cacao facilitators - Jesus H. Christ!", "Does the 5-7k figure take into account these costs, or is she actually earning about 2-3k after expenses?\n\nShe may be extremely startled if she sits down and does her business books properly. At the moment it's not really a business, it's an expensive hobby.", "NTA. Your wife needs to stop indulging her interests at her family's expense. She needs to look for a JOB so that she can contribute to the family rather than just drain the bank account.", "First what the hell is a cacao facilitator? Your wife has a problem spending money. There IS an underlying issue. She has zero regard of finances. So my husband and his previous wife  had a joint account. They would use $ for what you are doing, expenses for the home. Well we have a store that everything is $1.25. Everyday she would by crafts saying she is making stuff to sell it gifts. They both were bartenders at places that were extremely busy. Would both be taking home $500-$700 a night. He was saving to build a house, well she would spend 25% of her daily income at the dollar store. Long story short he divorced her for constantly taking $out of the savings for stupid shit. Figure out her issue, it\u2019s not good.", "Nta. She's actively screwing your financial stability. The next \"course\" she takes should be a couples financial and budget planning course. \n\nNot saying she shouldn't be able to have nice things, but these courses benefit her, and only her. They don't benefit the family and they don't benefit her career in any way that would benefit the family. They are not small fees either. I'd calmly reiterate that while you're happy to support her, if the course is irrelevant to her career, you're not okay with the family money being spent on it. Or, she can spend the money anyway, but the remodel is off. It's not feasible to just blow money over and over.", "Close down the joint account. And really hopin u live up North", "NTA - Think you need to have a real sit down and discuss the spending. Whilst she does make some money, as you said however taking the savings you pay in without prior knowledge or consent would lead to a lot more issues down the road. Would be better to kind of step in now. Otherwise, the anger you currently hold will continue to manifest if it continues, which will only put strain on your relationship.", "NTA, obviously. I could say that a lot of those courses and retreats you mentioned sound like vanity projects, but it's not for me to judge. The point is; you had an agreement with the wife about how you both spend money, and a well-structured, smart setup, which is rather crucial in this climate. It seems she just walked over it all, putting your family's financial security in danger. Hope you can pull things back. Good luck.", "NTA - I assumed she was using her own earnings for this (which is still not okay if it's not what you guys agreed) but she's actually taking the **grocery money** to pay for these things? That's incredibly irresponsible.\n\nWhat did you say when she told you?", "NTA is my math off? Where I live you are struggling.", "You need a budget. I know that\u2019s a lame response. But until you know where everything is going, you can\u2019t fix it. You need rules and boundaries. I suggest a counselor to help talk through it. This is something where an unbiased third party would be quite beneficial. \n\nI vote NTA because I\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s difficult. First time I ever shared a bank account we overdrew several months in a row until we got the hang of it. One of us was much more responsible than the other. \n\nIf you love them, work through it. If not, that\u2019s ok too. \n\nDraw a line and respect yourself enough to enforce it.

Your wife is a TA", "NTA.\n\nI agree that your wife is spending money recklessly, and something needs to be done to stop the behavior.\n\nYou also have kids together, and is it possible that this behavior is coming from the perspective that she needed to put her life on hold and fills unfulfilled?\n\nI think you both need to have a serious talk about money and your expectations and work out some kind of compromise. Can you agree to open another account that receives a set amount of money each year, which she can use to take courses and go on her retreats? If that account doesn't have enough money in it, then she will need to wait until it does?\n\nRegardless, it sounds like you both need to figure this out quickly and get on the same page.", "It sounds like the two of you need to have discussion that's more than just \"any purchase over 100 pounds we would discuss first.\" You need to have a plan for how that is put into action since apparently that is difficult for your wife.\n\nMaybe that's the savings accounts are only in your name. Maybe it's she doesn't carry a debit card (literally it gets cut up) and she carries a prepaid credit card that never has more than 100 pounds on it and cash. This isn't a forever solution- it's a habit building solution. \n\nMaybe it's your entire household moving to cash based budget for now.\n\nMaybe it's that any courses she wants to take, she has to put on a credit card that is only in her name and that she has to figure out how to pay for. \n\nBut she needs to get into the habit of- she doesn't have money to just spend. It she wants to spend 1200 pound on a course- that's great. It's a discussion between the two of you of 'how are we going to save the 1200.' and than actually working to saving it- and it only gets spent once it's been saved.\n\nNTA To be this isn't about what she's spending money on. It's that your household income isn't high enough for what she's spending. She needs to understand that.", "NTA but you need to do something about this. Her behaviour is really horrible tbh. You need to parcel out discretionary funding for the both of you, and her courses only come from that.\n\nAlso check out r/ukpersonalfinance", "NTA, but you need to sit your wife down and have a serious talk with her.

Then ask if she thinks it is fair or justifiable?", "NTA\n\nI'm a massage therapist and can confirm these courses are addictive and you can never have too much training. But you guys should def be in agreement over how much is spent. I work it by putting aside a % of my massage income for training, so at least that way I know its paying for itself.\n\nEdit: what on earth is a cacao facilitator?

Especially coaching courses can pay back though, depending on the course. As far as I oversee the market, 6.3k for basically two major courses is not out of the ordinary. She might want to look out for a coaching franchise. Many hire subcontractors, which would be an excellent starting point. It appears also, that people with that choice of career building, need some courses to just find their own way. Enlightenment costs money (just a pun). It is quite common and you might want to plan in a certain amount for it in the next three years.
