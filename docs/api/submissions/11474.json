Now I get that while people are on holiday they don\u2019t necessarily want a sit down family dinner every night so every morning I check with them if they\u2019re having dinner at home and if I need to cook for them. Every day they\u2019ve said yes, so I cooked extra for them.\n\nThey have either come late and barely touched the food I made or not made it to dinner at all despite saying they would. They also have been bringing restaurant leftovers home every day.\n\nToday I did the weekly grocery shop and when I got home I realised I didn\u2019t have space for groceries in the fridge because it was basically takeaway Tetris in there! \n\n(ETA: I had spoken to them about this on Weds and Thurs already and BIL said he would sort it\u2026which he did not\u2026there was food in there more than a week old)\n\nSo I binned everything except what they brought back yesterday (Friday) and put the groceries away.\n\nWhen they got home they must have wanted to dump more stuff into the fridge. My SIL came running up into my bedroom and started yelling at me for \u201ctouching [their] stuff\u201d and saying how dare I throw her things away.\n\nI think she\u2019s being self centred.

First they tell you they\u2019ll have dinner at home and then clog up your refrigerator with takeaway containers.  SIL needs to get over herself. If the food meant so much to her she would\u2019ve consumed it instead of having it sit there for a week.  Is it even safe to eat food that\u2019s been sitting around a week?", "Very inconsiderate guests! One thing I\u2019d have changed in your approach would have been to leave the leftovers on the counter next to the fridge - and as soon as they return, ask whether they still need them.", "NTA. It's your fridge, you needed room for your groceries. Tell them you spared them from getting food poisoning. Eating food after seven days is iffy anyway. Eating food that has been in takeout containers and not well sealed after seven days is asking for food poisoning.", "NTA - for many foods, a week is long enough for the \"science\" experiment to start.", "NTA. If they want free reign of a fridge either get an Airbnb or a hotel. Your house, your fridge, your groceries for living.

Mine's full with my groceries.\"  If they said no, I'd say \"then it will be a good idea not to doggybag.\"  But you do not owe them another inch of your fridge real estate.  They are abusing your goodness.", "NTA. They are being very rude as guests, it's not their fridge or house.", "NTA. They are being incredibly inconsiderate by saying they will be home for dinner and then not having the courtesy to show up. Plus loading up your fridge with food with they then didn\u2019t eat is also not cool. You asked them to make space. They didn\u2019t. Their fault.", "NTA, it's not just that they were being inconsiderate, also the food was A WEEK OLD.", "NTA; good start with the food; now you just need to sling the rest of rubbish out on the street!", "NTA.

They keep bringing home leftovers and not eating them, taking up a lot of space in your fridge. They are disrespecting you.   \nYou could have warned them that they need to either eat the leftovers or throw them out but who is going to eat week old leftovers in the first place. For her to yell at you in your own house is beyond disrespectful.", "NTA. Just bc they are guests doesn't mean they get to take over your fridge. Not to mention they have been rude and dismissive of your willingness to cook.", "NTA. I personally never keep any leftovers for more than a couple of days. If I haven't touched it by then, out it goes. To have food sitting there for over a week taking up space is inconsiderate on their part.", "NTA! The entitlement is astounding!The yelling at me would have been a hard \"NO\"!", "NTA.  You asked them to take care of it, gave them a couple of days to do so, and they didn't.

They're guests in your house and they don't get to just take up huge amounts of fridge space indefinitely. You gave them a fair heads-up that you needed the space, and they didn't take it seriously.

Understandable they want to go out and fill a lot of their days with activities, they\u2019re on holiday.
