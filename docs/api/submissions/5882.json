She's just a little girl and this could be a good learning event for her. Keep her from stealing bigger things in the future.", "Happens all too often on this sub that those under 18 are given leeway because \u201ctheir just kids\u201d. Nah sorry I knew theft was wrong at 5 years old no matter who it was! 14 years old is old enough imo to be given the cold hard truth of the consequences of theft. Don\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t handle the time was what I was always taught", "Info: at what point did you \"throw away her switch\"?", "Not in my country.  \nA 14-year-old would go before a Children's Panel to figure out what had gone wrong in her life that she stole her mother's credit card to buy an expensive toy. \n\n(We have one of the lowest juvenile recividism rates in Europe, thanks to our system of dealing with youth offenders, and far lower than the US.)", "NTA- No, you don't have a right to steal if you think you don't get big enough presents!", "NTA", "Hahahahaha is Matt stupid? Because how does one sue someone over something that was bought with their own credit card? He can buy her switch since he's so concerned over it. What a ridiculous human\nNTA OP", "NTA by any stretch, though the post title is a classic head fake.", "Threaten about what? A purchase *you* legally made and *you* legally sold? Is he an idiot or what? I can see why Leslie behaves in such a way, she is properly parented (sounds like Matt is trying to further put her against you for this) only on one side of her family (yours).\n\nI agree with your action, your husband is right. You did the right thing. Matt is an AH and Leslie is sounding like one too. You and your husband should sit down with your daughter and have a serious talk. She is 14 which is enough to understand the value of money, although the entitlement from the other side of her parenting is gonna be hard to fight against. If she does not understand the privilege she has from it, she should work (idk babysitting, pet-sitting or whatever given the age) and see for herself.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Def ground and punish her for stealing or it will be a problem.", "That's not the bigger issue. It's an issue but the majority of kids that steal from their parents don't go on to steal from others. They don't see it as stealing even though we know it is \n\nThe bigger issue this woman has is that she needs to show her daughter that it is stealing and her ex is going to torpedo that.  Therefore,, this will be the last time this happens.", "Steals mom credit card now, then takes the car without permission. Takes things from grandma house, uses moms credit card again without permission mom permission. Takes things from auntie.  I think this was more of an impulse problem. But it needs to be nipped"]}
