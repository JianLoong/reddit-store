Leslie is from a previous relationship with Matt (35M). My husband is Toby (33M).\n\nPractically ever since I had her, I've had problems with Leslie and Matt. Matt is from a well-off family and likes to spend big on her each year. Meanwhile, Toby and I are financially struggling but try to make Christmas as good as possible for our kids.\n\nI was sick for a bit and asked Toby to go ahead and do the Christmas purchases. I trust him. I thought the expense was high, when I saw it on the card, but again. I trust him. So, when Toby walked in with a Switch, I was shocked. We didn't have the money for that. Come to find out, he was shocked too.\n\nTurns out, Leslie grabbed my credit card and purchased the Switch when Toby was buying the stuff for the kids, knowing that it could sneak by. I was furious. I sold the Switch to someone I know.\n\nToby agrees with me, that was the right move. But when we sent Leslie to her Matt's, for Christmas, we started to receive hell. Matt was calling me, saying that I ruined Leslie's Christmas, and threatened to sue for the Switch.\n\nI said that she was stealing my money, and if it was that big of a deal, he should have bought it for her. But he keeps telling me that she knows that I wouldn't have done enough for her for Christmas, so she had the right to make the move.\n\nToby is sticking by me with this, but Matt is giving me so much hell over it. He's calling me the Grinch and an asshole. Even Leslie has started texting me, saying that she feels \"mistreated\".

Just a parent.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nShe stole your credit card. That's both theft and fraud, and very concerning at 14.\n\nYour ex is being a manipulative giant AH by using it as an excuse to push your daughter to commit CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES because she feels entitled.\n\nFrankly, this would be grounds for law enforcement to be involved. If she's doing it there, she may be doing it elsewhere", "NTA\n\nShe stole money. That alone should get her zero Christmas presents.", "You titled this post incorrectly. You didn\u2019t throw away her switch. You sold it (why not return it?) because she STOLE your $$ to buy it without yours or Toby\u2019s knowledge or permission. I was ready to down vote you and say YTA but you\u2019re NTA. Your daughter and your ex sure are though.", "NTA.\n\nYour kid should not be rewarded by keeping what she stole. What is she going to buy next ?", "Let me get this straight, your daughter stole your credit card, bought herself a switch with your stolen card, threw a fit when it was returned and your ex said you were the one who was wrong? WTF.", "NTA. I don't want to call Leslie TA because she's 14  - sure, that's old enough to understand that what she did was wrong, but I bet she was getting egged on by Matt, who is the real TA here.  If Matt wants his daughter to have an expensive Christmas present he can buy it for her.", "Oh NTA AT ALL! She can't just steal hundreds of dollars from you and expect everything to be fine. They'll laugh Matt out of court if he tries to sue lmao", "You can't be serious. There is no way this is true. \n\nThere is no way he thinks it was OK for her to steal $400 from you.", "NTA. Remind Matt that if he sues (with no standing, no less) then the courts will have a record of her stealing from you. That should shut him up.\n\nAs for Leslie, punishment for theft doesn't change if you recover your money.  Leslie is now your maid and gardener until she works off the amount she stole.", "NTA. If an adult did what Leslie did it would be prosecuted as credit card fraud. Matt can buy her a Switch if he thinks she should have one (though I don't think she should have one myself), but Christmas is not about giving yourself fraudulent gifts.", "That\u2019s straight up stealing. Go report it! Or at least threaten to. NTA", "Ummm NTA.\n\nIf Matt\u2019s so hung up on Leslie getting a Switch, he should buy it himself.\n\nAnd what kind of parent condones stealing?  Matt, looking at you bro.", "NTA.\n\nIn what world does Matt think he can sue you over getting rid of something purchased on your card without your permission? Like if he had bought it and you got rid of it, he\u2019d have a chance but\u2026your daughter stole your card to make the purchase. That\u2018a illegal.", "INFO\n\nHow do you intend to **punish** your daughter now?\n\n>  I was furious.

She needs to learn her lesson otherwise I\u2019d hate to see how she turns out as an adult.", "NTA. Your daughter effectively committed theft/fraud by using your credit card to make the purchase. If you could not return the Switch to the store/supplier it was bought from, it makes sense to sell it on.\n\nAnd is Matt deluded? How does he think he could sue you for the cost of something that was not your daughter's property in the first place.", "NTA. Feels like there\u2019s some parent alienation going on from Matt\u2019s side here", "NTA and if you really want to up the ante report her for theft of Toby\u2019s card", "Wow definitely NTA but Leslie needs to know that you can't afford it and she stole from you, yes STOLE.", "Nta.

She does not have the right to steal money from you which is what she basically did.", "NTA, your daughters father sounds like he\u2019s out of touch with reality.

NTA.", "The fact that you even had to make this post to ask if you are the asshole, makes me angry. \n\nMatt sounds like he is a very bad influence on her, she\u2019s going to grow up to be just like him if you don\u2019t wedge in somehow. I feel\nFor ya.", "NTA. I suggest you talk to the local police department and see if someone there is willing to talk to her about credit card fraud. I knew a kid who's parents did that after their other son had stolen their credit card to buy about 600$ worth of designer hoodies. This kid was 16 or so at the time, so idk if they'd do it at her age, but I mean, she really seems to need it.\n\nAnd as well too... See if they'll write a letter to give to her dad.
