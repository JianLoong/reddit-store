I only ever go to the gym to do my cardio and so I have used all 3 of the treadmills. \n\nThe treadmills are off to the side of the gym in their own area facing windows. They are all 3 different brands and function a bit differently. The one on the far left is visibly old and just not as nice to use. The one on the right is fine but a little confusing to use with a lot of extra buttons that I still don\u2019t know what they do. The one in the middle is my favorite one. It\u2019s easy to use and it\u2019s new. So, whenever I go to the gym I always use the middle one if it\u2019s open. Side note: it\u2019s almost *always* open, there\u2019s rarely people in the gym at the same time. \n\nWell, I was just on the treadmill and halfway through my workout, when two girls come in. My headphones are in and I barely notice them at first but in my peripherals and reflection on the window I see them just hovering by me. Like I said, the treadmill area is off to the side and separated from the rest of the gym so this is odd. I turn to look at one of them and she immediately turns to act like she wasn\u2019t staring. The other one looks like she\u2019s scoffing or huffing at me (my earbuds are in I can\u2019t hear). I take my earbuds out and just say \u201cHi\u201d and they flatly respond \u201cHi\u201d and then leave the gym entirely. Weird but whatever I resume. \n\nAbout half an hour later I\u2019m done and walk down the stairs through the pool clubhouse which the gym is on top of. The girls are there sitting, they see me and get up and go towards the door to the stairs to the gym. I just nod at them as we cross paths when one of them goes \u201cIf you\u2019re working out by yourself you should really use the treadmills off to the side\u201d and I just respond by saying \u201cHuh?\u201d. And they both go on to say I was hogging the treadmills and preventing people (them) from using the treadmills together. That it\u2019s inconsiderate to choose the one in the middle because what if people want to be next to each other.\n\nI\u2019m just tired and sweaty and have no energy to argue so I just kind of laugh and say okay. I told my sister about this and she said she understands where they\u2019re coming from and that if all 3 were open when I got to the gym I should\u2019ve chose one on the side. \n\nI think that\u2019s stupid and I should be able to choose whichever one I want but maybe I\u2019m wrong?

That's a \"problem\" utterly without consequence.", "NTA\n\nHow ridiculous....do your thing and ignore them.", "NTA. Omfg!!!! Seriously?? The entitlement is staggering. They could have asked how long you had left on your run and done some squats while they waited. Unreal. Your sister is insane for siding with them.", "NTA You got there first.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. I get people like their space, but there is no reason to complain when they get an entire machine to themselves.", "NTA, especially since you were already halfway through your workout. Cardio machines always have churn, you take what's available when you get there. \n\nIt's only YTA if you all got there at the same time, or if one of them was already on one of the side treadmills and you got in the middle.", "NTA, you didn't pick the middle one bc it's in the middle but because you like it best. And no one else was there.\nI wonder if you could swap them so your preferred one is on the side, if you want to not get in this situation again? Or if the manager could change them?", "NTA.\n\nYou were there first.\nIf they really wanted to run together they could've been mature and politely asked you when you were going to be done.", "NTA.   \nThey should have spoken up \u201cHey, we are here to work out together, do you mind moving over to an end one?\u201d\u2026 they can\u2019t get huffy if they don\u2019t ask!   \n\n\nAnd in future if there\u2019s people hovering and you feel they might need to say something ask them! \u201cHi, all good?\u201d And let them know they can say something to you\u2026   \nCommunication is how to solve most issues!", "NTA, I would probably do the same thing as you.

You got there first and you have every right to take whatever treadmill you want.", "NTA. It's first come first serve. They could've asked you to move but they didn't. They acted weird and got mad at you for no reason", "NTA - you use the one that works best for you. There's no reason to use an old one or a confusing one \"in case\" two people come in and can only work out if they're right next to each other.\n\nIt's silly that they didn't just work out on the two available machines. Had you noticed, you'd probably would have offered to switch with one of them, but it wouldn't have been necessary to do so. \n\nToo bad they were not mature enough to ask you if you'd mind switching.", "NTA. You wouldn't be even if they were all the same, but since the one in the middle is different from the other two and you like it best, use it, that's what it's there for. If they would've asked you to move so they can work out together, maybe it'd be a nice courtesy if it's not that much of an imposition, but they didn't ask, so it's on them.", "NTA \n\nNot only were you there first, and the machines work differently, but who are they to teach someone \u201cmanners\u201d when they couldn\u2019t even have the common decency to communicate their desires and just assumed rude staring would give them the results they wanted? People are so entitled and the lack of self-awareness is exhausting. Also, are they so incapable of working out separately that every machine they want needs to be available at the same time? Do they not have a backup plan if possibly TWO people were on the treadmills? Would they expect someone to get off just so they could work out together because their mere presence was there? \n\nI workout with my sister usually later in the night at her complex (schedule reasons and lack of people in the gym), and there are three treadmills. Whenever we go and two or the middle is taken, meaning we can\u2019t walk together and talk, we will either split up and do solo workouts or take turns on a different machine and chitchat while the other works out. It\u2019s not like they couldn\u2019t have achieved the same goals of working out together without the treadmills.", "NTA - I understand it would be a bit of a pain for them to not be able to work out together but the gym is first in first served, you can pick whatever treadmill you want. If they want to work out together that bad go for a run around the block.", "Who does that? NTA. Given the choice, I'd 100% choose the better treadmill, every time. That said, if they're all exactly the same model/condition, I would choose one on the end \u2014 hopefully more space between me and people.", "Currently commenting from the middle treadmill: not the asshole", "NTA.  If they were all the same kind of treadmill then that would be different - but they are all different and have different controls - you used the one you like to use, and there was no one else there.    If they wanted to work out together, they could have asked if you would mind moving.  Instead they behaved like a couple of idiots with the passive aggressive mumbling and walking off in a huff.

This seems like it should be a non- issue.... why would anyone think you're just supposed to automatically not take an available machine you want just IN CASE two hypothetical future people may want it? They're not entitled to it just because they want proximity. No more than a single person would be entitled to it for any other reason. It's first come, first serve. They can either ask you or wait. But it's nonsense to shame you for not predicting other's future possible desires and not putting them above your own.", "NTA  \nIf all the equipment were the same you might be E S H,  but the fact that the machines are in different condition and are different models makes your choice personal.   \nThe other users can choose to do their workout in different order or at a different time.", "NTA since they are different from each other. I would have said Y T A if they are all the same. \n\nAlso, the women could have asked if you'd mind moving. They obviously weren't too scared of you to be passive aggressive later.", "Are you the guy that chooses the middle urinal? Light YTA.", "Yta but only a slight one.

They can\u2019t get huffy even if they *do* ask, and she says no. \n\nIf I\u2019m running on a treadmill, I\u2019m almost never running at a conversational pace. I save those runs for outdoors. I\u2019m also much more reliant on the machine to tell me things like distance and pace because my watch is less accurate when I\u2019m practically stationary. Changing machines costs you all of your stats. It\u2019s also not like you just hop on where you left off. It takes time for it to catch up, and those kinds of changes throw you off and can entirely ruin a run. \n\nIt sounds like these girls were more interested in socializing than exercising. They can do that anywhere.

While I can recognize creepy behavior for what it is, I also feel like when you decide to join a gym, you are conceding that you will not be exercising in private.\n\nPersonally, that whole idea sounds **_awful_** to me.

I guess, I feel like if you've decided it's more important to have access to the fancy machines at the gym, you have to understand that you're sacrificing privacy for that privilege.", "Oh\u2026 I agree.

So I\u2019d say the privacy for privilege bit is a bit off putting.", "NTA.  All three machines are different and you selected the one you like best.  Besides, who the heck can carry on a conversation while getting a decent workout on a treadmill?  (Except the actors in tv shows and movies, of course.)  The girls would have also left if there were two people using the machines and only one on the end was open or only the one in the middle - they can get over their entitled selves.\n\nAnd take your sister to the gym so she can see the difference herself, then ask the folks running it to rearrange the machines so the one you like is on the outside.  See how well that goes over!", "They had no idea if you got on that treadmill because someone else was on the outer treadmills but got off and you continued your run, or what.

I\u2019ll make sure to bring a friend next time.\u201d\n\nLike, they just assumed the treadmills would be open for them?", "NTA because the machines are different.  If they were 3 of the same machines I would use a side one to leave space for someone else.", "NTA they could\u2019ve literally asked you nicely to use one to the side while they\u2019re there so they can workout next to each other ? instead of huffing and puffing and being brats lol", "NTA, entitled gym girls are the worrrrrst", "NTA\n\nIf all three machines were identical, that might apply.   They are not, so that does not apply.", "Nta - how do they know there wasn't someone else next to you who already finished for example. If they didn't want to talk they should've just waited until you left.", "NTA \n\nThey were purposely rude and entitled.  Those girls could have asked if you were willing to switch or gone on either side of you. (Rude to ask when someone is in the middle of doing cardio on a machine to stop and switch machines. However you can ask. I have been asked this before and depending on where I am in my workout  I will reply with yes or no. It\u2019s understandable if you ask once and take the answer given). They obviously didn\u2019t take this route. They just tried the hover and stare down. \n\n\n\n\nThey did not have to say anything when they saw you leave. This puts them in the confrontational A - H range. I find this to be poor human behavior. Frustrated the world didn\u2019t cast them as main characters they lash out at you for doing something reasonable that interfered with their delusions of reality.  \n\n\n\nYou did nothing wrong in my eyes as far as gym etiquette goes.
