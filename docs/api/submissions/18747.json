I only ever go to the gym to do my cardio and so I have used all 3 of the treadmills. \n\nThe treadmills are off to the side of the gym in their own area facing windows. They are all 3 different brands and function a bit differently. The one on the far left is visibly old and just not as nice to use. The one on the right is fine but a little confusing to use with a lot of extra buttons that I still don\u2019t know what they do. The one in the middle is my favorite one. It\u2019s easy to use and it\u2019s new. So, whenever I go to the gym I always use the middle one if it\u2019s open. Side note: it\u2019s almost *always* open, there\u2019s rarely people in the gym at the same time. \n\nWell, I was just on the treadmill and halfway through my workout, when two girls come in. My headphones are in and I barely notice them at first but in my peripherals and reflection on the window I see them just hovering by me. Like I said, the treadmill area is off to the side and separated from the rest of the gym so this is odd. I turn to look at one of them and she immediately turns to act like she wasn\u2019t staring. The other one looks like she\u2019s scoffing or huffing at me (my earbuds are in I can\u2019t hear). I take my earbuds out and just say \u201cHi\u201d and they flatly respond \u201cHi\u201d and then leave the gym entirely. Weird but whatever I resume. \n\nAbout half an hour later I\u2019m done and walk down the stairs through the pool clubhouse which the gym is on top of. The girls are there sitting, they see me and get up and go towards the door to the stairs to the gym. I just nod at them as we cross paths when one of them goes \u201cIf you\u2019re working out by yourself you should really use the treadmills off to the side\u201d and I just respond by saying \u201cHuh?\u201d. And they both go on to say I was hogging the treadmills and preventing people (them) from using the treadmills together. That it\u2019s inconsiderate to choose the one in the middle because what if people want to be next to each other.\n\nI\u2019m just tired and sweaty and have no energy to argue so I just kind of laugh and say okay. I told my sister about this and she said she understands where they\u2019re coming from and that if all 3 were open when I got to the gym I should\u2019ve chose one on the side. \n\nI think that\u2019s stupid and I should be able to choose whichever one I want but maybe I\u2019m wrong?

You wouldn't be even if they were all the same, but since the one in the middle is different from the other two and you like it best, use it, that's what it's there for.

People are so entitled and the lack of self-awareness is exhausting. Also, are they so incapable of working out separately that every machine they want needs to be available at the same time? Do they not have a backup plan if possibly TWO people were on the treadmills? Would they expect someone to get off just so they could work out together because their mere presence was there? \n\nI workout with my sister usually later in the night at her complex (schedule reasons and lack of people in the gym), and there are three treadmills. Whenever we go and two or the middle is taken, meaning we can\u2019t walk together and talk, we will either split up and do solo workouts or take turns on a different machine and chitchat while the other works out.

But it's nonsense to shame you for not predicting other's future possible desires and not putting them above your own.", "NTA  \nIf all the equipment were the same you might be E S H,  but the fact that the machines are in different condition and are different models makes your choice personal.   \nThe other users can choose to do their workout in different order or at a different time.", "NTA since they are different from each other.

I\u2019m also much more reliant on the machine to tell me things like distance and pace because my watch is less accurate when I\u2019m practically stationary. Changing machines costs you all of your stats. It\u2019s also not like you just hop on where you left off. It takes time for it to catch up, and those kinds of changes throw you off and can entirely ruin a run. \n\nIt sounds like these girls were more interested in socializing than exercising.

If you can't work out next to a stranger, I don't blame you - it's awkward and embarrassing when I'm gasping for air at a slight jog, lol. Even still, it's not a wrong choice to choose a machine that isn't in use, even if that machine is between two others that are currently unused. If you get offended by people who do that, you probably need to either figure out why or start working out at home, because the world doesn't run by your definition of social manners.", "NTA. You aren't psychic, you didn't know they were going a) arrive after you b) want to use the treadmills or c) use the treadmills together.", "Just like urinals its location, location, location", "YTA, think of anything in a set of three where position matters like urinals in a men\u2019s room. It doesn\u2019t matter if your the only one in, take the furthest from the door. So the next person can take the next one from you but leave and empty in between. This is the way", "Not judging, but I treat equipment in rows at the gym the way I do urinals - closest to an end without being next to someone, if possible. Leaves the most opportunity for everyone to have personal space.", "A treadmill is not a urinal, and if peeing next to another person is so horrifying find a stall.", "If they were identical it's still nta for me. Are we exercising or having social hour?", "I usually accept the fact that people aren't psychic...", "When I worked out a gym (pre-covid), I always used the same treadmill because:\n\n1.  I am a creature of habit, and\n\n2.  It had the best airflow (and the tv in front of it didn't have fox news on).", "Exactly. I had a favorite treadmill. That\u2019s what I used if it was free.", "I go to the gym regularly and find all of this complete nonsense. I sit where there\u2019s room, exercise where there\u2019s room.", "It's a treadmill, not an airplane seat. How much side space do you need to (not) run forward?", "Urinal Space Theory.", "When treadmills even begin to approach the closeness of any type of seating named so far this comparison will work. Frankly looking for miniscule non issues to judge people on sounds exhausting.", "lol really hoping no one's dick is out while on the treadmill though.", "That's ridiculous. If I have to use a urinal, I'm using whichever one I feel like using. Maybe it's the one on the end, maybe not. What I'm not going to do is worry about how someone else is going to feel about where I'm choosing to stand for a couple of minutes. My focus is directed elsewhere lol. If they're that concerned with personal space, have a shy bladder, or something else, they can wait or use a stall. It's absurd to call someone an AH for simply choosing to use a particular urinal or treadmill in a public area. Also, OP is NTA.", "I don't have my dick out when I am on a treadmill, so it is not remotely the same.", "They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. How many people do you see outside walking in pairs or even larger groups? Why do running clubs exist? Why do group bike rides take place? Often, being part of a group encourages people to participate in the activities more regularly. Why, because of the social aspect. That is a good thing. \n\nOthers have said this already but I view this as the same as not choosing a middle urinal when everything is wide open. Why? Because in both cases I would prefer to have distance and separation when possible from strangers. Most people feel the same. \n\nAgain, in this particular case with the one treadmill being the most suitable for the OP he is NTA.", "They shouldn't even ask. It breaks concentration to have to respond.", "That\u2019s true!", "True, that's reasonable. But still, asking is better then just getting mad at someone for no reason. OP could have said she's only got x minutes left so she wouldn't be bothering them too long if they went on the free machines or something like that. I don't know\n\nEdit: Op could have said that if they had asked.", "You would be surprised how many times this happens at my gym. There are like 50 open treadmills and some weirdo will get on the one right next to me, this happens like twice a week. I usually just get off of it and go on another one without saying anything", "Seriously. You're peeing, not doing a social experiment.", "I don't. Why? Because a urinal and a treadmill couldn't be less similar. Also it's totally ridiculous to whine about the urinal someone chose to spend a minute peeing into as well.", "True. I guess that I am just a casual runner and what works for me may not float other runners' boats. Happy running to you", "you were free to move, though. they were free to choose their seats, maybe those were their favorite spots, maybe they sit there all the time and you were an interloper. it doesn't matter, though. this is not the same as OP's situation.", "Yes, which is exactly what I said in my comment\u2026", "A treadmill is not a urinal.", "If no one else is in there, why not?", "Bus seats are far removed from treadmills in every imaginable way.", "This isn\u2019t about this specific situation. She is nta. I\u2019m talking to the other commenter.", "Because someone else might come in and would be forced to stand next to you. Most people would prefer to have space between them and a stranger, given the choice.", "It doesn't take that long to pee. If it bothers you, wait until they're done.", "Just pee and move on with your day. Good lord. If the thought is trying that terrifying, there's usually a stall.", "YTA treadmills are like urinals, can't choose middle one", "As the cool kids say, THIS. As far as I know, proper gym etiquette is \"excuse me, how much longer do you have?\" It is NOT awkwardly staring until you shame someone into moving.", "The urinal rule only exists because there are men's rooms without dividers between urinals and because there are homophobic men who are worried about someone seeing their dick.", "> Lol, you can't just go to a gym and start moving around heavy equipment on your own\n\nThat is exactly what I do when I go to the gym.  I move heavy ropes, heavy weights, and heavy barbells.", "Nobody's being \"crowded\" by someone using an adjacent treadmill.", ">If they're 4 identical treadmills\n\nBut they aren't. OP describes three unique treadmills.", "I feel like I shouldn't have to explain that there's a difference between items that are meant to be moved around, and whole entire machines that are not meant to be moved.", "I mean, you don't have to be psychic to go \"Oh there's a water bottle here, someone must be using this treadmill, guess I'll pick a different one.\" \n\nBut like I said, I recognize that it's a me thing and the dude didn't actually do anything wrong lol", "Treadmills are about 3 feet wide (or at least mine at home is).  I am 2 feet wide.  If I am in the middle of one, and we account for a small space between the two treadmills, we are probably still 18 inches apart from each other.", "Eh, it's why I used judge in quotes. I more am just pleased when I come across people that try to be privately considerate whenever there is a chance to be considerate. I don't judge people negatively for not doing so, I am just very optimistic and love people! \n\nI literally get touched when I see people take carts back to the carousel lmao, more so then when people feed the homeless. I know it sounds ridiculous, I just like the idea of removing chaos with the only intent to remove chaos rather than to be \"good\".", "Despite al the downvotes to my comment, I wholeheartedly agree with you. I only once in my life had a running mate who matched my pace. We would exchange a few words every mile or so, and found it useful. If we had not have been able to, we would have slowed down a little. Asi said elsewhere, I find it useful to greet strangers whom I pass while running in the park. But, each to his own. The important thing is that we are running", "Which isn't crowded by any stretch of the imagination even with the invented measurements provided.", "Yes, if anything, if people are running rather than walking on the treadmill it\u2019s LESS hygienic being near them than the urinal would be. Lots of sweat and heavy breathing takes place during cardio. \n\nNobody here is whining unless you want to throw yourself under that bus. People do it as a small courtesy to those around them and to maintain their own space.", "I agree.  I am pointing out the actual dimensions.  My treadmill is actually 36.5 inches at its widest point.  My shoulders are 24 inches across.\n\nIt is not like adjacent seats on a bus or plane where you are touching each other.  It would be more akin to sitting across the aisle from other people.", "That lack of hygiene for the reasons given applies to being in the gym at all if you even walk by anyone. Aka mental gymnastics. But the sad \"no u\" attempt was something truly special."]}
