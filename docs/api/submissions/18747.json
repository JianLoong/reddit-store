You wouldn't be even if they were all the same, but since the one in the middle is different from the other two and you like it best, use it, that's what it's there for.

People are so entitled and the lack of self-awareness is exhausting. Also, are they so incapable of working out separately that every machine they want needs to be available at the same time? Do they not have a backup plan if possibly TWO people were on the treadmills? Would they expect someone to get off just so they could work out together because their mere presence was there? \n\nI workout with my sister usually later in the night at her complex (schedule reasons and lack of people in the gym), and there are three treadmills. Whenever we go and two or the middle is taken, meaning we can\u2019t walk together and talk, we will either split up and do solo workouts or take turns on a different machine and chitchat while the other works out.

I\u2019m also much more reliant on the machine to tell me things like distance and pace because my watch is less accurate when I\u2019m practically stationary. Changing machines costs you all of your stats. It\u2019s also not like you just hop on where you left off. It takes time for it to catch up, and those kinds of changes throw you off and can entirely ruin a run. \n\nIt sounds like these girls were more interested in socializing than exercising.

However, with all of them being different, it just doesn't make sense to insist people use the side ones, first.", "NTA It is stupid they all are stupid.", "Nta. Nothing prevented them from using the other 2 that were there. They're acting like miles separated the treadmills. Also, first come, first choice. Especially when the machines are all different.", "NTA. They're entitled and it's just about the dumbest thing to get passive aggressive over. They can't wait for you to finish or do something else or just use the treadmill separately for a stretch of time? Idiotic behavior.", "A) No.\n\nB) Your sister is a narcissist.\n\nC) Carry on", "Agree, if they were all the same it would have been a bit inconsiderate to pick the middle one. Same rule as with urinals, if you pick the middle one you make it awkward for a second person. But since they are different you can pick a favorite. \n\nPlus, they should have communicated properly. He even gave them an opening when he said Hi. A quick, polite \u201cCould you move to one of the others please?\u201d and this would have been a non-issue, but they\u2019d rather act pissy and passive aggressive", "Also how could they know that when OP started that the middle one was the only free one and the people one the sides just already left? \n\nAnd if you train, you don't talk, i guess, so who cares?\n\nNTA Why choose a bad treadmill because their could come two people who react like them?!", "Did they shit in the urinal?", "Will be doing so next time", "I\u2019m having a BLAST sending my sister these responses lmao", "They are definitely older than me too, at least by 8-10 years", "Ayyy represent", "Or they could just nicely ask if Op would be willing to move over one treadmill. Op acknowledge them being there and turned to them wondering what's up. Perfect time to ask. But no. They just say hi, leave and then get mad because Op couldn't read their mind. They certainly need to learn how to communicate", "Lmaooo I didn\u2019t even realize this point when they brought up the tribal thing", "Isn't this a silly mindset? You're in a public gym - there are going to be plenty of people around you unless you go in the dead of night. Getting pissy about someone using a public machine is a you problem. NTA", "It immediately reminded me of an old Dave Barry column where he explains which urinals dudes use in a public bathroom, complete with diagrams, lol.", "A urinal is (hopefully) a quick use thing though.   \n\nA treadmill is not.   \n\nPicking a location to the side for something that won't effect t yourself for long is normal.   But for something you're doing for longer you should be able to take your own situation more into account.  So if there's a \"reason\" of any kind that you don't want the outside locations (including just not wanting to) then it's fine.", "It\u2019s not necessarily creepy behavior that I\u2019m worried about. I also like my space as a result of the pandemic.", "I don't know about you, but I don't tend to take my dick out on a treadmill.", "I literally use the ends because I don\u2019t want people hearing me dying on a treadmill (because somehow that tiny bit of extra space makes me feel like they won\u2019t hear my suffering) \ud83d\ude02 never thought about it any other way", "It is kind of silly, but if there is no other reason to pick one treadmill over another seems like a good way to pick to me.  And it isn't completely pointless.  COVID still exists, having one treadmill between you while you run for a half hour isn't a terrible idea.\n\nAnd honestly I think people do this naturally in a lot of aspects of life without even thinking.  If there are 3 empty spaces in a parking lot, would you take the middle one?", ">And honestly I think people do this naturally in a lot of aspects of life without even thinking.  If there are 3 empty spaces in a parking lot, would you take the middle one?\n\n... Yes, lol. Yes I would. That gives me ample room to get out and gives the people on either side plenty of room as well, provided no one else pulls in.", "But does it make you an AH if someone doesn\u2019t do that naturally?", ">If there are 3 empty spaces in a parking lot, would you take the middle one?\n\nMaybe.  It depends.  Maybe based on the width of the aisle or the position of my car the middle space is the easiest one to use.  Or maybe there's a long truck in one of the spaces.  Parking spaces change all the time.  Just because there are three spaces when you start to park it doesn't mean that couldn't change before you even get out of your car.\n\nIt's situational.  Just like the treadmills are situational.  The three treadmills are not equal.", "The treadmills cost gyms money.  They are not pieces of furniture that are decorative.", "A soft yta if you take the middle spot first for no reason, urinal or treadmill.  If there is a physical difference between the treadmills, then NTA for sure.", "Not sure what point you are making.  I'm just saying if I walk up to 3 identical treadmills that are empty and right next to each other, I would take one of the edge ones to hypothetically give myself and another person more space.  I'd rather not run right next to someone if I don't have to, and I think most people feel the same way.", "I understand what you are writing. \n\nWhat I am writing is that whilst that is nice if you, and thoughtful, gyms purchase equipment so that it is used. Persons can use any treadmill they wish. The treadmills are there for use.  Treadmills are not a cafe, for social interaction. If a gym were to buy treadmills where only the ones on the outside (using the three treadmills together as an example) get used, the gym is losing potential income. \n\nSo, whilst the idea of having no one besides you is nice, it is not always practical.  Further, not everyone feels the same as you (and I). A treadmill is a treadmill. People go to the gym for exercise, not to socialise (yes, I know some people do go to socialise). \n\n\nI have thought about this for a while.  For me, I would love a 3 metre gap between gym items, for my own bubble. Totally impractical for most gyms.  Have you thought what would be okay for yourself? That way, taking the middle treadmill is no longer an issue.", "I didn't mean to imply one should never use the middle treadmill, just use the outside ones first.  If only a middle one is available, of course you should use it.", "NTA. What if you were using that one because the others were in use when you started, people need to get over themselves and learn to share.", "Hard NTA. They were being whiney because someone else got there first. But their entitlement is ridiculous. They assumed you were there by yourself. But what if you weren\u2019t? What if other people were there using the other treadmills and you got the only open one in the middle? So what? You have the right to use whichever one you want. You don\u2019t answer to hypothetical or actual people that show up. A gym has other equipment they can use until you\u2019re done. It might be different if all three machines were identical.", "What? No. NTA. Instead of being passive aggressive THEY could have KINDLY asked you if you wouldn't mind moving to a treadmill on the side.", "NTA. You took the mil that suited you. If they are so codependent that they can\u2019t work out more than a meter apart they have bigger problems than treadmills", "NTA - going to the gym with your friend does not mean you have to train side by side and hold each others hands. \n\nYou were there first, they could have asked if you would have minded. They didn't, they made a thing of it.", "NTA. It\u2019s the machine you like best, and the gym was empty when you got there. I find these women to be crazy entitled; they could have worked out together and chatted on other equipment and just waited for you to finish. \n\nBesides, let\u2019s say you went to work out and both end treadmills were in use so you took the middle one. Then both of the others finished and left, and you of course continued your workout on the machine you were on, and these girls came in? They have no idea the circumstances or reasons you\u2019re on that machine, and to assume and make judgements, especially because they\u2019re simply not getting what they want and is convenient to them, is insane. \n\nThey were rude, you are fine. NTA.", "NTA. I really don't understand the need to be running side by side with your friend. Do they plan to hold hands while they workout? Or maybe spend the whole time walking and talking? don't really get that.", "NTA. Aside from the treadmills all being different models and types, which can easily explain why you used the one in middle, it's simply not your problem. If they wanted to workout together then maybe they should have come earlier or they can simply continue doing what they did and wait you out.", "NTA\n\nyou would be if the treadmills were the same.", "NTA that's so childish of them. You're there to exercise.", "NTA - They literally at any point while in the gym could have just asked you politely if you wouldn't mind moving over one so that they could use the others next to eachother.  This would also have been the perfect time to ask them to quickly show you how the one on the right works.  Instead they chose to play the martyr's and wait for an opportunity to make a snide remark.", "Treadmills aren't too hard to move. Just take a day when nobody else is there, and swap their positions. That way the one you like is on the side instead of in the middle.\n\nBut honestly those girls are just entitled. You get on a treadmill to exercise, not to chit chat. You didn't stop them from exercising, the machines were open. But they'd rather sit outside, than not be able to talk to each other. Thats on them, not you. You have a good reason for picking the machine you like, and they dont.", "NTA. You're right. It IS stupid.", "NTA. I will never grasp the neurotypical urge to invent poorly defined social rules like this. It\u2019s up there with people who think it\u2019s rude to shit in a public bathroom when a bathroom is literally a place made to relieve one\u2019s self in.", "NTA in this scenario because the girls could have politely asked you to move over one. Now if you said no YWBTA because a treadmill is a treadmill, the end goal is all the same.", "NTA. I can't even fathom how anyone could think you did anything wrong. You were there first, you got to choose the machine you wanted. Even if you chose that one at random, you still would be NTA.", "NTA.  They sound immature.", "NTA. They're complaining that they didn't get something that they didn't ask for. They want you to see the future and read their minds. I imagine if they asked, you would have been willing to move. They are expecting you to inconvenience yourself at all times so that they don't have to be bothered to speak to someone one time.", "If they were three identical machines I would say choose an end one. But as they aren\u2019t you are entitled to choose your preference. NTA", "NTA - use what ever equipment you want. If they want to talk then go to a coffee shop.", "NTA. You got there first, you picked the treadmill you wanted to use.  Do they want to chat while they run? Surely they could still pick the same settings and do the same workout just not as close together?", "NTA\n\nThere are no eye rolls big enough to respond to entitled, ridiculous nonsense like this! It's the main reason I hate using gyms. \n\nOh boo hoo, two adults can't be next to each other as they sweat it out and do the exercise they are there to complete...Are they in primary school? Are they planning to hold hands as they run in place? No, so they can either work on other equipment until the treadmill is free or they suck it up and get on with using the 2 free machines. \ud83e\udd37\n\nNo time for that energy vampire bull - I'd tell them to grow the eff up and take their first world problems with them. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA, different equipment or not, you don't have to accomodate people going to the gym together.  This isn't a thing.", "NTA you\u2019re entitled to use any piece of gym equipment you want. Even when I go with a friend we separate at the gym. I\u2019m there to work out, not socialise", "Nta\n\nNot really seeing the connection to urinals. I don't mean that I don't understand the argument.", "NTA Choose whichever one you want. The machines are there for working out, not socializing. If they want to talk while walking, that is something they can do anywhere.", "First in first served\n\nI can't believe some people think you should use the side first, what next.. Walk into a restaurant or eatery you have to sit at the first possible seat next to/behind someone like it's a seating order.\n\nThe entitlement of some people are staggering and expect others to follow they're rules/mentality.", "NTA. you have a treadmill that you like to use and were there first with a gym that is almost always empty! (Actually using the equipment) You were polite! Sure they decided that one time to gym together but honestly how good can you chat when running in a treadmil? They were judgey from the start and sure they could have done other warm ups and equipment or even asked you and then discovered the various machines and then \"shook horror\" even made friends with you as well! You may even have cut your session short if they were nice about asking and needs?\nHonestly I'm sure they wouldn't be happy if two adults running by themselves or even other buddies were in the machines. You weren't asked, you didn't tell them off. Honestly you prolly won't even see them again. (They decided to stew in anger downstairs and waste their time when they could have warmed up, talked to you or even done other things and machines)", "YTA people like space don\u2019t be that weirdo who sits next to people on an empty bus. Yes your there first but use the end ones.", "Man fuck them kids.\n\nNo but seriously, like what the fuck are you there for? To work out or to have a chat? Like chat at a fucking park while you jog if you're so keen to chat with your friend.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - you're entitled to use whatever treadmill you want. \"*There's rarely people in the gym at the same time\"* so if you use a treadmill that is less good (for whatever reason) you're just compromising your own experience on the off-chance that an unlikely event occurs. In this case, the unlikely event did occur, and even more unlikely was that two people wanted to use the treadmills next to each-other, presumably because using separate treadmills would have compromised their experience. At that point though, they still could have asked you to make a change.\n\nThere's no reason you should compromise your experience every time, just to avoid the slim possibility of compromising their experience or making them have to ask you to move. In a busy gym, or even if they'd been in there when you started, I might think differently, but in what you've described you're NTA.", "When the treadmills are open they are open.  Anyone can use any machine and there isn't an obligation to consider hypothetical preferences of people who aren't there.", "So basically it\u2019s similar to urinals, except you keep your junk in your pants", "Why should OP have to do that? She was there first, she gets to choose her treadmill. They are all different", "Also they have no way of knowing whether the treadmills were occupied when OP arrived. Maybe only the middle one was free, then the other two people left, should OP then move?", "I think no person would wanna use a treadmill next to you if you use it like a urinal", "I would, too, but if someone was 'hogging' the middle treadmill I would stfu and still do my workout routine because I'm a grown-ass woman.", "Then they can go the gym at the crack of dawn when no one is there if they are that antisocial.", "This was my thought too. I wondered why they didn't just ask. I will say that in most shared spaces at least here in the states, there is an unspoken rule about leaving one space between you. Waiting areas in offices or hospitals, lecture halls in college, rows of treadmills or elliptical machines etc. If it isn't packed, this is how people very naturally situated themselves, leaving an empty seat or space inbetween without being prompted or asked. But in OP's case, the gym was empty and they have a preferred machine which happens to be in the middle. By the girls logic, OP can jidt never use the middle treadmill unless the outer ones are already occupied. That's silly. Sure, OP could have picked up on the fact that two girls wanted to use the treadmills. And honestly it's weird imagining myself being sandwiched between two friends who will likely be holding a conversation with each other while running so I would have moved because I would be uncomfortable with that. But the girls just leaving without a word and being passive aggressive about it is weird.", "So true. I get a bit embarrassed because when I'm running I go until I'm dying and then all of a sudden someone is next to me and I'm just over here gasping for air", "For me it makes for potentially fewer people able to see if/when I fal off it. Which has happened non-zero times. -_-", "Yes, absolutely! It would be the easiest to pull into.", "What? No seriously, what this have to do with anything?", "I am honestly so confused! Never in my life have I heard it's rude to take the middle of anything. Unless maybe it's a pie and you cut a circular piece out of the middle...", "She took the middle one because it suited her better. There are three different models in that gym.", "Well that is not the case here. They are not identical.", "They weren't identical treadmills tho. They were three different types and buttons for settings. That's why OP liked the middle one for their workout.", ">Unless maybe it's a pie and you cut a circular piece out of the middle...\n\nlolololol", "Yeah in this case, but people are objecting to the premise of if there are three identical ones as well."]}
