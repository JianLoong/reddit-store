That\u2019s it. If your fianc\u00e9e is not on board, you guys have a bigger issue. She should be really worried that her mom is spending money she does not have on such an egregious thing.", "NTA. This is not her wedding. You can't make it? Oh well, sorry, but we are moving forward.  \n\nIf you don't stop MIL now, this is what you have to look forward to in the future.", "NTA. Don't get angry about it. Just tell her the date is decided and if she doesn't want to go, that's her choice. You're being very considerate holding a second event. It's not her choice and for an event this significant, her family should be making arrangements to ensure they can get there.", "MIL wants to move your wedding date? Well, it\u2019s a good thing *its not up to her*. NTA \n\nIf somebody can\u2019t make it to the wedding in the middle of the week? Well, it\u2019s the end of the world that they missed your party. How will they ever survive :(", "NTA - While I understand the parents reasons for wanting to move the date, I do believe that you are well within your right to have it your way. You only get married once and it shouldn't be an inconvenience to you. Plus putting the parent into potential debt would hang a cloud over your marriage for years should it lead to any bigger issues.\n\nPerhaps ask the husband having to postpone his retirement over renovations should be asked what he thinks about it, if he is on your side you could very well ask him to make her realise how bad of an idea it is to spend double to move it a couple of days.", "NTA you know the risks of a midweek wedding and are having a separate event later. Yes people will feel excluded but it\u2019s your wedding when it comes down to it. As long as you and your fianc\u00e9 want this, then do as planned.", "NTA.  Keep to your date and have your fianc\u00e9e back you up on the decision you both made.  If things are starting off like this, you need to nip it in the bud now.", "NTA.\n\nUltimately, it's your wedding, so you and your fianc\u00e9 should make the final decisions on the date and venue. \n\nYou can politely decline your mother-in-law's offer to pay for a weekend wedding if it's not what you want or can afford. If your mother-in-law's comments are bothering you, it might be worth having an honest conversation with her about how they make you feel.", "NTA and frankly if you start your marriage by letting your fianc\u00e9e's mother run the show, that's how it's going to be the entirety of your married life. A marriage is a partnership between two people, not three.", "INFO: What is the cost of this second event compared to the cost of moving it to Saturday? Because if moving the wedding to Saturday means you only need to have 1 event, it might be worth it.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to listen to anyone besides your fianc\u00e9 on this. It\u2019s rather surprising she offered to pay the difference, most horror stories here lack that aspect. Still, you wish to kindly decline and that\u2019s that. However, rage? What else are leaving out, OP? I get rolling your eyes at those statements and being annoyed, but being \u201cincandescent with rage\u201d (great vocab) over this suggests there\u2019s more. Is she bombarding your phone over this? Because otherwise being that enraged over this comments *is* excessive.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e needs to say: \u201cThanks for the offer, mum! We\u2019re very happy with the venue and date and won\u2019t be changing it. Please save your money.\u201d\n\nCongrats and good luck!", "NTA\n\nAs part of being married the expectation is you form a new family unit. Part of that is having each other\u2019s back.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean if your spouse is being an AH you take their side. But it does mean you discuss big things like a wedding date, come to a decision and then communicate the decision to whomever.  \n\nIf a change is suggested then again the two people who will be this new unit discuss and decide. \n\nIMO the reasoning of \u2018my parent is asking for whatever and we must say yes or that parent will be unhappy\u2019 is NEVER acceptable.  Reason being is where does that logic stop?  When you decide to move for a great job promotion?  Where you decide to buy a house?  When you decide to have a child?  When you decide what your child will be named?  \n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 does not have a strong enough spine to stick up for the decision you both already made     then perhaps it might be best to delay the wedding until she does.", "No is a complete sentence.", "NTA\n\nThis is not her wedding. Due to that she gets no say in the matter", "> mother in law (to be) dropped round and said the midweek date was no good\n\nNo, it's good, because you and your fianc\u00e9e considered it and chose it.\n\nWhile it's a shame that your fianc\u00e9e's aunt can't make the ceremony, she can still attend the separate event no bother; she isn't an essential part of the ceremony (*unless* her attendance is essential to your fianc\u00e9e - but it doesn't seem so else she'd not have been on board with the date the two of you selected).\n\nYou definitely need to be presenting a joint front here though - this needs to be you and your partner giving a firm \"No, this is the date we've selected for the ceremony, and it's not open to debate\" - it is YOUR wedding not MIL-to-be's!\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if your MIL was paying for it, these aren't her decisions to make. And your fianc\u00e9e should absolutely have your back on this, she's the AH too", "NTA - and watch your fianc\u00e9e closely because the way she handles this is how she\u2019s going to handle your MIL imposing on all future decisions in your life together. It is an unfortunate fact that you marry the family, too, so make sure you\u2019re fine with this. Your MIL is promising money she doesn\u2019t have to force her way. Take note and hold firm.", "NTA. And this is not someone you want to be indebted to either. That's a sharp stick that she'll poke you with in years to come too.", "NAH\n\nIf you really want a mid week wedding, then stay with it.

If you don\u2019t want a wedding on a Saturday that\u2019s fine, but not moving it just because you don\u2019t think she can afford it is just rude and Paternalistic.  It\u2019s not your money nor your place to judge her spending.", "Sorry, to clarify, I am a man and my fianc\u00e9 is a woman. Hence the beard on my avatar :)", "I do not get on with her husband unfortunately but it is a good suggestion otherwise. I suspect he reluctantly agreed to a smaller amount, my mother in law not realizing the full amount it would cost.", "Unfortunately my fiance is very close with her mother and she has a great deal of influence. She's now erring towards agreeing with her mother. \n\nI fear that the wedding won't happen this year due to this intervention. Both my father and her grandparents are very frail and I doubt all three will make it to next year if the wedding is postponed. \n\nAt which point my feelings toward this intervention would go from unhappy to very, very angry.", "1 event is not possible. My fiances grandparents are too frail to travel for a 5 hour trip so we would have a dinner event there anyway. The cost of a dinner there is not determined so far but the cost of living is lower there.\n\nThe cost of moving our wedding to a Saturday would be around \u00a35500.", "When we purchased our home, her mother suggested my fiance should get 50% of the equity, despite me providing a deposit equivalent to a lot of the houses value. \n\nI suggested we receive a share equal to our initial deposit, and the balance paid for by the mortgage be split 50/50 between us. In other words, getting what you put in and going 50/50 on the mortgage.\n\nIt became a large row which almost resulted in our relationship falling apart before agreeing on a compromise. \n\nAgreeing a date and venue has also been a point of tension for a while. \n\nLast week I was characterized at a dinner with her family friends for being the one holding up agreeing on a date. It led to an argument. I was so stressed I only slept an hour that night and barely made it through Monday in the office. \n\nThis also isn't the first time her mother has made demands that the wedding include certain items which greatly increase the price. For example a professional comedian to host,a live band, professional decorators. \n\nShe's incredibly close to her daughter, so after her interjections her suggestions become mandatory and it throws all the pieces off the board and we go back to square one. \n\nI was so relieved to get something agreed we were both ok with and looking forward to the event and planning fun things like a honeymoon. \n\nI also have a hot temper and grew up in a household of people with very strong tempers, so I am aware this is a problem that I am trying to work on. I focus on calmly articulating what angers me and going for a walk.", "This isn't the first time one of her interjections has seriously strained our relationship, and I fear it won't be the last. \n\nMy fiance is an only child who moved countries a lot and often didn't speak the local language for a while. As a result,she is very close with her mother. Any expression of being unhappy with her mothers actions results in a very defensive response, to the point it feels like gaslighting.", "Yes I changed it. Your wrote fianc\u00e9 in your post, which is the male version. It was my mistake.", "You do realize this will be your life going forward if you don\u2019t get your fianc\u00e9e on your side, right? Every decision will be questioned and changed to suit your MIL. And heaven forbid you have kids! \n\nNTA, but you need to pause everything until you and your partner are on the same page.", "Not getting along doesn't mean you can't see eye to eye on something that is slightly left field of a logical proposition from the mother in law. There's plenty of people I don't get along with, but only a select few can't be reasoned with.\n\nGood luck either way as I'm sure whatever is decided upon will generate some friction.", "Explain that to your fianc\u00e9e and see what she says.  If she is still leaning toward her mother then realize that your MIL will forever be the third party in your marriage with more influence in your home than you.", "If your fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t stand up to her mama that wants to make a change in the wedding that goes against all common sense and then the wedding *doesn\u2019t happen??? * Well, then, dearie, you have dodged a bullet.", "I\u2019d push back the wedding completely & think seriously if this is what you want for the rest of your life.
