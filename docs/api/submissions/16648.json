How pretentious to think you will move your date for someone. Wedding are expensive as is.", "I am fairly certain that Op and fianc\u00e9e thought this through though? I would put money on the thought that they're responsible and have been planning this for more than a few days. People/friends would know of the date and have had plenty of time for scheduling any time off. This isn't a surprise wedding or a random elopement. If someone can't get the time off or don't want to be bothered then that's the guest's decision. It is not up to op and his fianc\u00e9e on whether the guest can make it. He is not obligated to bow to the conventional weekend wedding because it is an inconvenience for others who are not him and his fianc\u00e9e.\n \nMIL is trying to show OP that she is still the most important person in her daughter's life and that the daughter isn't being taken away from her. She's asserting her place and power with you and her daughter. I doubt she's thinking that consciously.\n\nIt seems MIL has issues with stability from what op has said about moving alot, the language (and i assume culture) problems, and the spending. So far the *one* safe emotional constant in her life has been her daughter. The spending is an attempt to fill the emptiness she feels. She has not been getting her emotional needs met for a long time and is therefore trying to fill the void with tangible objects.  It really isn't about her sister, she's grasping at straws to delay your fianc\u00e9e's abandonment.\n\nYour fiancee has unconsciously picked up on her mother's pain and how she is her mom's joy. Since a very young age she's used her own exsistence and unconditional love to make her mom not hurt. When a kid grows up as the emotional support/crutch for their parent a very unhealthy relationship is formed. Your fiancee has spent her entire life thus far trying to keep your MIL happy, it sort of feels like your fiancee is afraid to finally be the one who hurts her mom. She'll feel guilty and anxious over the thought but not quite be aware that this is what is happening. \n\nBesides there will be some who can't make it on a \nweekend. 'Cause kids don't magically disappear on the weekend and jobs never call people in on days off. god forbid a birthday, funeral, or other obligation happen on a weekend happen. Life is a week-long thing, unless I am misunderstanding something. Please explain to me how weekends are so sacred and free from all responsibility so everyone invited can make it.\n\nOp is holding a second celebration just for those who can't make the wedding but still want to do something to celebrate the union. That is legit more than what most couples would be willing to do.\n\nThen there's his grandparents and dad. Death really really makes it hard to attend and it generally doesn't rspv. Trying to work around death is far more inconvenient and stressful and depending on what is happening to include the one in death's grasp could be really dark super creepy and awkward.\n\nI also wanna point out that what matters the most in the wedding is op's and fiancee's love and understanding of each other. Nothing else. \n\nOp talk to your fianc\u00e9e about how you are feeling and why you feel that way. If you have difficulty in saying this verbally there are other forms of communication that will help you. I honestly rec working on a letter to her explaining things. Don't just attack your MIL and talk only of this. Tell her you love her. List reasons why you do, serious or nonsensical doesn't matter it just has to be the truth. Talk about how excited you are about this. Talk about mundane things that you do with her that reminds you of your love for her. This will become less about you accusing your MIL of hijacking and sabotaging your wedding (which she is, she so so so doing this do not allow people to convince/gaslight you about this). Then tell your fianc\u00e9e that you will not accept a verbal response. That this is written because it'll be a tangible object to help her remember this time of your lives in years to come. Request a letter in response. This will give her time to sit and think about her love for you. This is your celebration of love. Other people are not involved in this union (unless you are poly and there's Talk and rules) they are celebrating it not making the vows.\n\n....sorry for the word vomit op\n\nNTA", "Serious question OP, do you have an objection other than your knowledge of your Mils financial situation? Like if parents in law were loaded, would you still not want it moved to the weekend or would you not care? \n\nIf you just point blank don't want it moved, then fair enough. But if you don't care, or if your wife would rather it be at the weekend, and your MIL wants to offer the money, whether she can afford it / what she'll have to do to get it is actually none of your business. \n\nIt would be much better for your life moving forward to give up trying to control whether your mother in law SHOULD BE offering and just base your decision on whether you care what day the wedding is.", "There are so many red flags on all your comments that I don't even know where to start. Are you SURE that your fiancee is the one for you, the one you want to spend the rest of eternity with, if she comes as a package deal with her mom? When you have kids down the  line, she's going to want to interject and raise them the way she thinks is right. She will question your parenting skills and choices at every turn. I do not see your relationship surviving unless you decide to not give a shit anymore and just become a doormat yes man, or your fiancee learns to stand up for herself... which from your comments, doesn't seem likely.", "OP, I hope I'm not too late for you to see this, but PLEASE seriously reconsider marrying this woman. \n\nMy boyfriend's (on the way to being) former friend got married last year. He gave $500,000 of his and his mother's money to his now-wife to buy their marital home, and to put a VERY long story short, his name is not on the deed despite him fronting 80% of the deposit and reno fees. We have 0 doubt the wife's mother also helped in ensuring that things played out the way they did. \n\nPlease do not think that you need to marry her because \"you've already come this far, might as well get on with it.\" This is not a situation where the sunk cost fallacy even remotely applies. NTA if you stand your ground on the issue of the wedding venue but seriously reconsider EVERYTHING about this relationship for the sake of your life for the next 50 years.", "NO. SHIT!?

It is massage therapist. Masseuse/masseur have other connotations here. Other place may be different.", "Not really - like so many things, the default in French tends to be male. A whole group of women with one male? You use the male form for the group. Apparently it's inconceivable that a man is referred to using a female term, but women being described in male terms seems perfectly logical! So using fianc\u00e9 would make logical sense, even if it doesn't feel right."]}
