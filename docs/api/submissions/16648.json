Don't get angry about it. Just tell her the date is decided and if she doesn't want to go, that's her choice. You're being very considerate holding a second event.

You only get married once and it shouldn't be an inconvenience to you. Plus putting the parent into potential debt would hang a cloud over your marriage for years should it lead to any bigger issues.\n\nPerhaps ask the husband having to postpone his retirement over renovations should be asked what he thinks about it, if he is on your side you could very well ask him to make her realise how bad of an idea it is to spend double to move it a couple of days.", "NTA you know the risks of a midweek wedding and are having a separate event later.

It\u2019s rather surprising she offered to pay the difference, most horror stories here lack that aspect. Still, you wish to kindly decline and that\u2019s that. However, rage? What else are leaving out, OP? I get rolling your eyes at those statements and being annoyed, but being \u201cincandescent with rage\u201d (great vocab) over this suggests there\u2019s more.

Part of that is having each other\u2019s back.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean if your spouse is being an AH you take their side. But it does mean you discuss big things like a wedding date, come to a decision and then communicate the decision to whomever.  \n\nIf a change is suggested then again the two people who will be this new unit discuss and decide. \n\nIMO the reasoning of \u2018my parent is asking for whatever and we must say yes or that parent will be unhappy\u2019 is NEVER acceptable.

My fiances grandparents are too frail to travel for a 5 hour trip so we would have a dinner event there anyway.

In other words, getting what you put in and going 50/50 on the mortgage.\n\nIt became a large row which almost resulted in our relationship falling apart before agreeing on a compromise. \n\nAgreeing a date and venue has also been a point of tension for a while. \n\nLast week I was characterized at a dinner with her family friends for being the one holding up agreeing on a date. It led to an argument. I was so stressed I only slept an hour that night and barely made it through Monday in the office. \n\nThis also isn't the first time her mother has made demands that the wedding include certain items which greatly increase the price. For example a professional comedian to host,a live band, professional decorators. \n\nShe's incredibly close to her daughter, so after her interjections her suggestions become mandatory and it throws all the pieces off the board and we go back to square one. \n\nI was so relieved to get something agreed we were both ok with and looking forward to the event and planning fun things like a honeymoon. \n\nI also have a hot temper and grew up in a household of people with very strong tempers, so I am aware this is a problem that I am trying to work on. I focus on calmly articulating what angers me and going for a walk.", "This isn't the first time one of her interjections has seriously strained our relationship, and I fear it won't be the last. \n\nMy fiance is an only child who moved countries a lot and often didn't speak the local language for a while.

And heaven forbid you have kids! \n\nNTA, but you need to pause everything until you and your partner are on the same page.", "Not getting along doesn't mean you can't see eye to eye on something that is slightly left field of a logical proposition from the mother in law. There's plenty of people I don't get along with, but only a select few can't be reasoned with.\n\nGood luck either way as I'm sure whatever is decided upon will generate some friction.", "Explain that to your fianc\u00e9e and see what she says.

I never said anything because my FIL told her to get bent but I really believe that if I had then I may have set a precedent that I can and will defend myself against her abuse. This will get worse, don\u2019t back down, you got this!", "The other option to do it within our budget was significantly less fancy and the vast majority of the guests are in the same metro area as the wedding. So it's one day paid holiday, maximum two if you want to stay late. \n\nAdditional context, in my country 28 days is the minimum paid time off. AFAIK it's lower in some places.", "That's a fair perspective. Some additional context. Last week her husband was complaining he had to delay his retirement. I asked what he would do once he paid his mortgage and he replied 'eat'. \n\nHer mother also confided in us that she was ashamed how much she spent on her renovations and is reluctant to tell her husband. \n\nIt's these kind of events that lead me to doubt 8n her financial planning skills.", "So this should be a warning not to marry your fiancee - because you will be marrying her and MIL together.", "If that is the case, a delay may be the best thing for you. As things presently stand, marrying your fianc\u00e9e would give your future MIL control over your life, because your fianc\u00e9e can't stand up to her. Unless you actively look forward to many years of your MIL controlling your life, you should pump the brakes on the wedding, so you can seek couples counseling and your fianc\u00e9e can seek individual therapy in order to learn how to set boundaries and say no to her mother.", "Do you really want to live the rest of your life like this?\n\nCause things won't change with marriage, it will get.only worse.", "Why would you want to marry someone whose relationship with their mother is like that?  I couldn't imagine anything worse.  It will only get worse throughout your marriage.", "I don't think you should marry this woman. I understand that might be a disappointment to your father to not see you married but if you marry her you marry her mother too. \n\nAlso when the MIL doesn't have the \u00a35500 then what?", "Understandable, but I think the truth is no matter where you live, week day is less convenient than weekend. Especially if any guests have to make arrangements with their children (not sure if it applies here). But it all depends on your priorities! If you want fancy, go fancy. Just to be clear that her expectations are in line with the norm whereas yours are not. It doesn\u2019t matter since it\u2019s your wedding, not hers. \n\nI do think you\u2019re making the right decision about not accepting money she isn\u2019t good for. She seems like someone who makes some questionable decisions but I think her heart is in the right place technically.", "Why does that make you furious though?  Her mother is offering to pay to have you get married on a day when important family members can be there.  If your only objection is the money, that\u2019s not your business.
