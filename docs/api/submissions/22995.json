Mid life crisis maybe lol.\r  \n\r  \nSo here's the conundrum where I want to see if I'm the a-hole. I stated on my profile that I'm not really looking to date or be in a relationship, and that I really just want to get out and have a good time every now and again. I listed simple things like going out to try restaurants, or hitting movies, concerts or local bands (I'm pretty close to Nashville so finding bands to check out is pretty easy), heck just going to a park or doing something mundane was fine, I just wanted to get out and have some interaction. Anyways I had some hits, and I got to go out and do a few things, but I really hit it off with lets call her \"J\" (F28). We went out a few times doing normal get out of the house type things that I stated in my profile, and it was always a lot of fun!\r  \n\r  \nAnyways we are at the bar having conversation and she just out of the blue brings up going to my place and watching a movie. We go back to my place and put on a movie. As the movie is going and we are having some laughs, she is getting closer and closer to me and she starts kissing on my neck and around my ear. I cave in and things progress and now it's hot and heavy. She pretty much rips my shirt and pants off and she does the same quickly to herself and she bends over the couch. I tell her to hold on because I need to grab a condom. I quickly grab a condom and we start going at it. All is going great when suddenly the condom breaks (we were being a little rough). That was my only condom.... I apologize to her but essentially tell her that we need to stop with penetration because I didn't feel comfortable having unprotected sex, but I could help finish her in other ways if she wanted. This is where it went off the rails. She said it's fine and to just keep going with penetration. I told her again, that I prefer not but we can do other things. She got noticeably upset and told me I thought she was dirty or a skank, which is definitely not the case. Either way, she said she wanted to leave because I had offended her. I apologized over the phone, but she is refusing to talk to me. I know sex happened, but I essentially ruined the friendship by making her feel bad by not wanting to have sex without a condom.  \n\nI feel like I was in the right being safe, but now I feel like maybe I should of just continued having sex with her because she is very clean and well put together and I could have seemed judgey.  I highly doubt she had any STD's or anything, but I was just used to practicing safe sex outside of long term relationships.

You don\u2019t know her well, she could have an STD and not even know it.  Honestly the fact that she was so insistent on having sex with someone she barely knows without a condoms reaffirms you made the right call because she either does that regularly (and hence increases STD risks) or was looking to get knocked up.  Did you even discuss BC?  She\u2019s the asshole for being mad that you wanted to protect yourself.", "look, having sex without a condom isn't for everyone and I know can always depend on a situation.  you weren't comfortable doing it without one and she should have respected that.

They have STDs besides HIV/AIDS that don't have a cure...a lifetime of pain for minutes of pleasure?\n\nNot worth it. Protect your life.", "NTA. To be honest, it's refreshing to read that a man set a boundary for himself and held his ground during an intimate encounter. You concerns were reasonable, she was not.", "NTA. You're not obligated to do anything you don't feel comfortable doing and her not respecting it is a huge red flag, which also makes me doubt about her health conditions. If she's so okay with having unprotected sex with you what guarantees she hasn't done this with other people before and is potentially at risk of having an STI/STD and passing it to you? \n\nDo not feel bad for having a boundary.

The fact that she was keen to proceed bare-backed really means she's not overly concerned about sexual health and most likely has done that before. This puts you at risk.. This also puts her at risk of pregnancy unless she is on other contraceptives..  This has the ability to impact YOUR life for at least 18 years..

Also, I'm very proud of you for having the self discipline to stop having intercourse because the condom broke and you didn't have any more. Most would not be able to pull that feat off. Also, I highly advise that you heavily invest in condoms so you dont have to repeat this situation in the future.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. As a woman, we expect men to listen to us when we say, \"no,\" \"stop,\" etc and we should also listen to the MEN if they say the same thing. No one should be forced to have sex/continue having sex if something feels off for any reason. She didn't respect your decision to stop, and that's a HER problem. If she doesn't respond, then you lost a good friend, but she's the one that messed up. Birth control isn't 100% effective, assuming she's even using any, so it's always a smart idea to use a backup (condom) if you're trying to prevent pregnancy. You're actually a really good dude for doing your part. Don't blame yourself for this mess please.", "The fact that she reacted that way is a huge red flag op. You two have different values. Just move on, you dodged a bullet imo \n\nNTA at all. Props to you for doing the right thing.", "That was well put.  Thanks.  Thought crossed my mind too.  That she was so quick to go without.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe she was just super comfortable with me?  I think that is what made me feel like an ass.  Like she was comfortable and I came off as not the same with her by going without protection.", "Exactly this! I\u2019m a woman and I support this 100%! Stupid decisions in the heat of the moment can come with a LIFETIME of consequences! You did the right thing and if she can\u2019t see that you\u2019re better off.", "I didn't necessarily feel \"pressured\" and I understand that's a red flag pushing for sex without a condom.  We had been out a few times platonically, so she wasn't a hookup I suppose. That's why I feel like me refusing could have made her feel like I think she is dirty.", "Yeah  I get that.  I really wasn't trying to offend her.  Maybe noone has turned her down before?  But I guess that would increase the chance of her having something from her past lol.", "Thanks.  I do wish she would kind of hear me out.", "Especially when hitting below the belt", "That's a fear of mine nowadays.  Lying about birth control.", "Not sure I know what you mean.  Like the one?", "Anyone that doesn't respect your sexual boundaries is not a once in a lifetime girl. It's a walking red flag. Something makes me think she wants to get pregnant. And if she's willing to have unprotected sex with a stranger she's less likely to be 'clean' when it comes to std's.", "She had made mention one of the times we were out that she was on the pill.  It was idle conversation and I didn't think much of it at the time.  But again I wasn't expecting anything sexual to come from our times out together.", "Yeah that thought crossed my mind.  Like what if it was a no for her and I was like \"cmoooooon it's all good\".", "Well I was open to explain my stance but she completely shut down.", "Amazingly good point.", "I mean I'm 10 years older than her.  Maybe it's just due to different times.  Hookup culture maybe creating blinders?", "Yeah if she were to talk to me again, I would say I would ask her to take a test if she wanted to do without a condom (pending the use of bc).  But I can't say she will ever speak to me.  Plus the relationship wasn't really even meant to be sexual, we were just getting along well and kinda just felt it.\n\nI mean honestly I was kind of surprised.  She knew my stance due to my profile early on, and she told me I was hot on maybe the first or second time we got together.  But after that, nothing flirtatious until this particular night.\n\nI mean do people ask people to get tested nowadays?  That normal conversation?", "Oof.  Possible.\n\nBut I will say, she was fine with using a condom until it broke.", "Lol thank you.", "I\u2019ve heard stories\u2026", "Lmao.  First time someone said that.  That\u2019s true.  Maybe I\u2019m the asshole for not having more on hand \ud83d\ude01", "Agreed.  I definitely need to improve my condom acquisition game.", "She\u2019s probably trying to get pregnant", "It could be. But even so, if somebody says no to having sex without a condom, then she should respect that and actually see it as a really positive quality in that person. But either way, you're not an arsehole.", "Nope she wants a baby", "thats a her issue, tho. If someone had the flu, and you didn't want to hug them, does that mean you think they are dirty?\nNo, it means you don't want the fucking flu. And that's completely ignoring pregnancy. \n\nIf a common, reasonable, normal boundary is a hang up for her, she's prob gonna be more trouble than she's worth in other areas  too", "Yeah, you cannot look at someone and tell what diseases or infections they have. Also, what if she wasn't on birth control or the birth control failed? Precum can get you pregnant. Better to be safe than sorry.", "Maybe she needs time to cool off. Maybe give it a while and reach out but if she\u2019s unresponsive then just know that you aren\u2019t in the wrong", "If she\u2019s the one. Hold her and never let go. Love is true", "Yea that\u2019s good that hopefully she is but you really don\u2019t know that she was telling the truth or that she takes them reliably enough to be effective.  If I was a guy I definitely would risk 18-21 years of child support based on someone\u2019s word that I don\u2019t know well and that is clearly ok with taking sexual risks.", "I'm someone who can go either way when it comes to condoms.  if the guy wants to use them, cool.  if he wants to go bare, that's cool too.  if the condom breaks and the guy doesn't want to continue I'd think he's just wanting to be safe and wouldn't think it's in any way about him thinking I'm dirty or anything.  so maybe she was self conscious about it and thought you were meaning something else by it.  but I do think it's interesting that she was ok with sex with the condom in the first place but then when it broke she was like oh ok...just go without it.", "It very well could be. Hookup culture has definitely evolved, and I have found that some of my younger girl friends are desensitized to certain situations due to their partners expectations. \n\nIf I had been in your situation, as the female participant, the moment you offered to help her finish in other ways, I would have been reassured that you meant no offense. But I am assuming I am around your age, so my outlook is different. Perhaps (sadly) she simply is just not used to being respected, as your boundary protects both parties.", "Yes yes, it is normal to ask for people to get tested, and if the person refuses it's already a sign you don't need to have any experience with them. Especially when it comes to hook ups, you don't know that person or their history, so asking for testing is the best thing to do. \n\nIf you really care about her, then I hope she talks to you again and you two can have a mature conversation. And always stand up for yourself. Never do anything you don't want to do especially when it can directly affect your health and life.", "But still she sounds like a red flag\n\nI think you dodged a bullet my friend", "Superman STI vision.", "Ah gotcha.  She is pretty awesome, but now she isn't talking to me...", "To quote the goddess, what's love got to do with it?", "Your point is valid.  Same thought crossed my mind as well.", "I mean I personally hate condoms.  I much prefer not to use them.  If I know they're clean and on birth control I'm perfectly fine with it.  \n\nNobody can say it's not better lol.  \n\nBut to your point, yeah.  Sex with condom ok, and then she was fine with sex without. Don't know if that's a red flag or comfort with me?", "I think that\u2019s what makes it a no-go her from now on for me.  Being mad is one thing but I offered to help her finish in other ways and she was still upset.  So I suppose I should take that fact as the biggest red flag.", "Do she got fat titssss\ud83d\udd25", "oh yeah...I mean obvi sex feels so much better without them.\n\nI mean, it seems like her insecurities got the better of her.  I'm with you on wanting to be safe with a condom outside of a relationship.  the fact that she said you offended her and has been ignoring you since I think says more about her than it does about you.", "bro what the hell, are you living vicariously through reddit comments?", "Bro, you changed up quick", "Well I doubt she will speak to me again lol.  I would like to explain to her.\n\nI mean I wasn't expecting to have sex with her at some point.  She called me hot when we first met, but that was literally the end of it.\n\nIf I had known she would want to take it to that level (again I was in for more friend / companionship initially) I would have talked to her about it more with her to feel it out.  But I wouldn't have been able to predict her reaction after the condom situation anyways I suppose...", "Yeah that was fast...", "well, her loss for not even wanting to keep a friendship", "So\u2026 does she?\n\n/jkjk", "Ok that made me laugh, thank you for that.  That was good.", "You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m proud of myself now \ud83d\ude0a"]}
