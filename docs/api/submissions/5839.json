My very first thought was that it is not the kids fault that your mother favours S's kids and that you should not punish her kids for your mom's actions.  But when 16M and 13M called your niece a baby and rubbed in the fact that they got more than her, I lost it.  They are little AHs in the making.  Your husband was fantastic, and the only criticism I have of him is that he should have given 16M and 13M lumps of coal.", "I really hope this is true. Nothing brings joy to my heart like little brats getting what they deserve. I love how your husband was like \"this is my moment. I'm going to be the world's best uncle forever\" and just went nuts. \n\nNo. You guys did good. Eventually something would have happened. This is better than them being asses and getting owned by people who aren't family.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou and your brother need start your own family tradition of celebrating Christmas before going over to your parents house.

You and your husband fought fire with fire and got your point across. S is a spoiled brat and turned her kids into brats. Hats off to hubby for going all out with the awesome gifts.\n\nWhy did your mom show so much favoritism to your sister when you were kids?", "NTA. Fuck them. They deserve worse.", "NTA and your husband did good. Having family treat one (or two) offspring extra special in front of all the others induces some serious trauma. Those kids are made to feel \"less than\" simply by existing and you obviously understand how deeply that hurt goes. I tell my sister \"we grew up in the same house, but we had totally DIFFERENT parents\".  Because I, like you & B,  was the \"less than\" child. It's trauma you carry for the rest of your life. \n\nFor parents/grandparents to be so highly uneven in gift distribution and to KNOW how unfair it is, and LOOKS, and do it in front of all the kids is sick. Especially at Christmas when everyone can see. This is NOT an accident. They KNOW, and I am so sorry they not only did this to you and B, but are now continuing the tradition of hurt to the grands as well. Definitely make a point to be absent in the future until they are willing to treat everyone's kids equally. Let the others be upset for getting a trip, the trip goers have been emotionally slighted for years, they DESERVE to feel special too because they are NOT less than and never were!", "NTA. Your parents are the core issue and have obviously created a similar monster in your sister.\n\nBut, to be honest, I find this kind of expensive gift giving an issue in itself. Maybe if you and your brother do something just your families next year you might consider lower key gifts and put an emphasis instead of the shared experience of the food and games together.", "NTA and your sister was way out of line (at least your mother kinda realized she messed up) but at the same time I don't think you should have involved your children and your sister's children in a proxy fight against your mother.\n\nIt would have been better had you simply left and told you parents you weren't going to Christmas with them next year since they broke their promise this year.", "I won't be, and I doubt B will either.", "My husbands parents are lovely.
