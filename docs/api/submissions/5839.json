Growing up S got everything she wanted and was spoiled. My parents would make B and I share our birthday and Christmas money with her so she didn't feel left out, but she never had to share with us. She was allowed to do multiple dances classes each week while B and I had to drop out of sport because our parents couldn't afford it. For Christmas B and I would get new (unbranded) clothes and books while S was gifted mobile phones, MP3 players, playstations, designer clothes and handbags.\n\nThis has carried onto S's kids (16M and 13M). For their birthdays and Christmas my parents will gift them hundreds of dollars of stuff, while mine and B's kids will get a small toy or two. My mother excuses it as S is a single parent and struggling financially, whereas my husband is from a wealthy family and B has a wife. B and I have asked our parents to give these bigger gifts separately away from the other kids to avoid hurt feelings, but they do it anyway\n\nB and I weren't going to go to our parents Christmas (Dec 24) this year. My mother asked why and we said it was because of the gift situation and also because they only ever talk about S and her kids. My mother promised it wouldn't happen this year. B and I decided to give her a chance and go. Everything was going okay until it came time for gifts. My husband had to work and was going to come later and bring our gifts, but my brother, sister and parents handed theirs out. My mother disappeared towards the end and came back with 'special' presents for S's kids. 16M got a new phone, and 13M got a new Ipad, and they got some other gift cards. My kids didn't really care, but my niece Evelyn (14) was upset. 16M told her to stop being a baby and she should just be grateful she got a gift at all. 13M and S laughed.\n\nI was pissed. I texted my husband to stop at the shop and pick up something extra for Evelyn on his way over (thinking an extra gift card). He came in with a new macbook pro, iPhone 14, ipad and pencil, PS5, a big lego kit, and several gift cards worth over a thousand dollars. She was stoked. My nephews were given some designer shoes they've been wanting and $50 cash. They asked what else they were getting. My husband said nothing, and that they should be grateful for the gifts they got.\n\nMy sister went OFF. Screaming about treating everyone equally and making her kids feel left out, and how they need computers and PS5's as well. My brother said 'like how mum always has always treated everyone equally' and my mother started crying. She said she gets she was wrong but this wasn't the time and we ruined Christmas. My husband said we were leaving and invited B, SIL and Evelyn to his parents house the next day for Christmas lunch  They came and my in-laws gave them an all expenses paid trip to Disneyland (and spending money).

If this is what it took to make your point, then that\u2019s what needed to be done. It\u2019s ridiculous that time sister and mother can\u2019t see how unfair they have been, so I hope this is the wake-up call they need. I think this had a good outcome and I hope things are fairer in future years.", "NTA, your husband is a legend for this power play. Ive done something similar and its an amazing feeling to layout some karma.", "NTA. Your parents are. They raised her to be a spoiled brat and now she teaching the same to her kids. They all need a good dose of reality.", "NTA you and B should just lower contact or cut contact with your sister and parents. They won\u2019t change their ways. S is their golden child and she shall stay their golden spoiled rotten golden child. \n\nYour husband and his family sounds like lovely generous people. Definitely just keep Christmas and other family related holidays with B, his wife and kids and your husband and his family.

Tell you sister to talk to mom about your tickets. I would have started that way before the kids reached 1st grade. Every year I would treat my kids and brothers kids to a trip every year. Let them open gifts after sisters kids. \n\nYour sister never condemned it. She accepted the extra gifts for her kids bc she was on the receiving side.

My very first thought was that it is not the kids fault that your mother favours S's kids and that you should not punish her kids for your mom's actions.  But when 16M and 13M called your niece a baby and rubbed in the fact that they got more than her, I lost it.  They are little AHs in the making.  Your husband was fantastic, and the only criticism I have of him is that he should have given 16M and 13M lumps of coal.", "I really hope this is true. Nothing brings joy to my heart like little brats getting what they deserve. I love how your husband was like \"this is my moment. I'm going to be the world's best uncle forever\" and just went nuts. \n\nNo. You guys did good. Eventually something would have happened. This is better than them being asses and getting owned by people who aren't family.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou and your brother need start your own family tradition of celebrating Christmas before going over to your parents house. If you going to keep in contact with your toxic parents and sister who was clearly your parents favorite child.", "First of all NTA.\n\nIf all this was really real your Hubby should take the Legendary Award for rubbing it back.", "This is hilarious and good revenge but it\u2019s too poetic I think it\u2019s probably made up. Who gives a teenager an ipad, macbook a PS5 etc. on a whim unplanned? Why didn\u2019t your kids also get something from your husband\u2019s trip?\n\nNTA if it is true.", "Nta ur hubby family is \ud83d\udd25", "NTA. You and your husband fought fire with fire and got your point across. S is a spoiled brat and turned her kids into brats. Hats off to hubby for going all out with the awesome gifts.\n\nWhy did your mom show so much favoritism to your sister when you were kids?", "NTA. Fuck them. They deserve worse.", "NTA and your husband did good. Having family treat one (or two) offspring extra special in front of all the others induces some serious trauma. Those kids are made to feel \"less than\" simply by existing and you obviously understand how deeply that hurt goes. I tell my sister \"we grew up in the same house, but we had totally DIFFERENT parents\".  Because I, like you & B,  was the \"less than\" child. It's trauma you carry for the rest of your life. \n\nFor parents/grandparents to be so highly uneven in gift distribution and to KNOW how unfair it is, and LOOKS, and do it in front of all the kids is sick. Especially at Christmas when everyone can see. This is NOT an accident. They KNOW, and I am so sorry they not only did this to you and B, but are now continuing the tradition of hurt to the grands as well. Definitely make a point to be absent in the future until they are willing to treat everyone's kids equally. Let the others be upset for getting a trip, the trip goers have been emotionally slighted for years, they DESERVE to feel special too because they are NOT less than and never were!", "NTA. Your parents are the core issue and have obviously created a similar monster in your sister.\n\nBut, to be honest, I find this kind of expensive gift giving an issue in itself. Maybe if you and your brother do something just your families next year you might consider lower key gifts and put an emphasis instead of the shared experience of the food and games together.", "NTA and your sister was way out of line (at least your mother kinda realized she messed up) but at the same time I don't think you should have involved your children and your sister's children in a proxy fight against your mother.\n\nIt would have been better had you simply left and told you parents you weren't going to Christmas with them next year since they broke their promise this year.", "I won't be, and I doubt B will either.", "My husbands parents are lovely. When my husband told them he invited my BIL my MIL stayed up late knitting Evelyn a little bear (all my kids have one the same) and she managed to throw together a little Santa stocking for her with small things around the house. My MIL felt bad she couldn't get Evelyn a pair of PJ's to match the rest of us because it was too last minute", "Money isn't an issue. I agree he went a bit overboard.", "There is no way this is real. On Christmas Eve the husband was able to buy all of these electronics at the last minute?", "B, SIL and Evelyn were invited by my in-laws to attend holidays with them from now on. I won't be going back to my mother's for Christmas, and B won't either.", "All purchased last minute on Christmas Eve, no less.", "We did our presents at home. We don't give our own kids presents at the family celebration. He doesn't really like my parents.", "S was born after a stillbirth and was premature. Doctors didn't think she would survive.", "We don't usually spend so much. My husband felt bad for Eve and wanted to show her she was special as well. He loves that kid like his own.", "Good point.\nEspecially the PS5", "He works next door to a major shopping centre. It wasn't hard to find them between the 10 or so electronic stores. The PS5 we actually had a home. He'd bought it for a friend who'd managed to secure their own and was going to return it after Christmas.", "It's terrible when parents show clear favoritism to one child over another. It's bad parenting and only builds resentment. The favored child usually ends up doing worse in life, and the parent ends up souring the relationship with the other kids.", "Not sure how it is now, but it took me a month to get a PS5 earlier this year. They were rarely in stock anywhere, and when they were, they sold out in under an hour.", "I don\u2019t believe that this happened at all.", "It was on order earlier in the year for a friend. It was delivered earlier this month. He was going to return it after Christmas as his friend had managed to secure one as well."]}
