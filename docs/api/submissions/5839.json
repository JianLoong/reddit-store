I'm hunting for receipts to confirm when the presents were actually bought.\n\nEDIT: people seem to be hung up on the PS5. We already had that at home. It was ordered earlier in the year for a friend who had managed to secure their own. We were going to return it.

Personally, I\u2019d not allow my children or myself to be a part of that & continue this toxic behavior. Go where you & your children  loved & valued & stay away from this type of toxic dynamic. You\u2019re all worth so much more.", "NTA\n\nYour husband gets massive bonus points, and so does his family. Like, wow. Way to put up a mirror to your sister and nephews' greed and entitlement.", "NTA!  Love your hubby.   He saw years of golden child treatment and just flipped that sh*t.   Don't back down,  do not apologize or feel guilty.   Stand Straight and say this is a life lesson...", "NTA hubby sooo planned this, sounds like he was tired of the mistreatment as well. I recommend not going to your parents for holidays anymore and just inviting your brother, SIL and niece only from your side (or basically people who deserve it)", "Your husband is the MVP.\nNTA.\nWhat a horrible woman your sister is.", "ESH\n\nThe mature thing to have done would have been to take your kids and go home instead of perpetuating the cycle\n\nI get wanting to get your kids more things, but you rubbed it in your family's faces just like they did to yours...and you have to ask yourself what kind of message that sends to your kids", "Nta", "NTA, I personally wouldn't spend celebrations with them as the favouritism has been going on your whole life and it might take some real distance for your mom and sister to realise how wrong it is.", "You need to go low to no contact with your parents. They cause distress to your family.  You are used to it but that does not make it acceptable.", "NTA. Your parents and your sister are a piece of work. Good for your hubby for passively aggressively setting them straight!  It was absolutely the right time to highlight their poor behavior. I would definitely go NC after that. Unbelievable...", "NTA your mom amd sister got a taste if what they had Bern doing for years,  honestly form now on u wouldn't do xmas with your momamd sister unless mom actually stops the golden child behaviour", "NTA. High five for coming through for that baby! Your sister is a trip. It was perfectly okay when she was on the other end of \u201cequality.\u201d GTFOH", "NTA and I love the spirit of you and your husband. After reading the comments, I love his family too. Your MIL sounds like the sweetest woman!! I hope y'all had lovely holidays and your mom and sister start to understand how they've made you, brother, and niece feel over all these years.", "NTA This is some r/prorevenge content", "NTA at all.\n\nHusband is awesome.  This has to be the most awesome dude that I have read about today!\n\nFavouritism sucks.  Yea, I wouldn't bother with your parents again.   They suck.", "Your sister and your mom deserved that and more.\n\n\nGood thing you don't have to attend the Christmas with your mom anymore.\n\nCheer", "NTA.  OP your husband is the GOAT for this.  Funny how your sister was fine with all the unequal gifts before your husband showed up with the extras for Evelyn.  She even laughed with her child at Evelyn but got hysterical over seeing her niece get extra for the first time after watching her cousins constantly get more all these years.  Normally I'm against people using their money to \"lord\" it over on others, but I'm totally fine with this.  As for you mom, what a piece of work.  She knows she is wrong but continues to do it still.  Probably crocodile tears at that she was crying when called out.", "Nta", "Husband is the real MVP!", "Exactly, designer shoes and $50 is much more than what they deserve", "This is one hundred per cent bs.", "And those kids will remember it. My grandma had \u2026 idk. 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, what\u2019s that, 11? At least 11 grand kids at the time of this story. We\u2019re gathered for Christmas and we\u2019re not adults, but not toddlers either. 10 of us get cards with a scratch off ticket in them. Fine, honestly, whatever. But grandkid 11 got, from grandma (grandpa was always against her), whatever the new gaming system was and 2 games. He got to open them in front of us as we all had to watch. Kids aren\u2019t dumb.  My siblings and I were a couple years older than him, but 2 of the cousins were right around his age. One of those cousins and I went outside to kick the soccer ball around and to talk about how much bullshit it was she did that in front of us, on Christmas. And \u2026 20 years later? Here I am, acknowledging no one is entitled to a gift but still what the hell??", "Proof?", "Yeah, the PS5 was the icing on the cake.  I can't imagine having so much in savings I could impulsively spend *thousands* on one shopping trip, let alone apparently regifting a PS5 on Christmas Eve (OP backtracked in a comment and said it was originally for someone else), which means either the original recipient gets a hasty regift or gets nothing. \n\nI wish I had the money OP pretends her husband has.", "I feel bad because it was in front of my nephews.", "Thats what B and I kept saying. If you want to give additional presents do it when we aren't around, and don't brag about them.\n\nThe PS5 had been ordered earlier in the year and was intended for someone else. It was already at home.", "Exactly. No way it's true, but the 1 in a million chance it is true, the whole family seems like spoiled brats. No wonder they hate each other.", "Yeah, watching their cousin get expensive gifts like they just did was pure torture.\ud83d\ude44", "I can see some online for a store close to where I live. I could walk in there tomorrow and grab one.", "Given the obvious pattern, it would have been smart to prepare in advance.", "Your in laws sound wonderful. My moneys on Evelyn has a matching pair of pjs for next Christmas.", "God that\u2019s definitely a reason I could understand but not condone. Your parents clearly thought it was okay to have 3 children and only really care about one and this is the result: a spoiled brat, 2 spoiled grandchildren, and 2 neglected and rightfully resentful children and there children. My mom tried to bring extra small gifts to birthdays and such for the other kids and I didn\u2019t know understand why, but it\u2019s examples like this that drive it home on why it was a good thing", "I am surprised he (and you for that matter ) are okay with exposing your children to this sort of favoritism. Even after you have experienced how it affects a person first hand.", "Huh weird they totally seemed like fair and honest people", "Purchased last minute, and presumably in a short amount of time.", "I purchased a computer monitor from Best Buy on Christmas Day and they had PS5s in stock (Canada). Just checked now for fun and they're sold out online again but 3 stores around Toronto have stock.", "Target by me had some on Christmas Eve still.", "If I had tons of money I wouldn\u2019t for long because I would do stuff like this all the time. I can believe it.", "Same could be said if comments like yours \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\n\nIdk why people like you get upset so easily lol", "Wealthy people and people with high paying jobs DO exist.", "From your post it sounds like they weren\u2019t innocent bystanders in this all and were due for a taste of their own medicine\n\nI get that they\u2019re only 13 and 16, but that\u2019s old enough to know right from wrong and to know how  wrong the years of favoritism was to their cousins\n\nTo me, making your niece feel special and loved far outweighs whatever guilt you feel for your nephews. Good for you guys for breaking this 30 year cycle of behavior from your parents - your children and niece are lucky to have you guys!", "Your husband is fucking awesome! Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise! Spoiling a kid was never ok but this situation was totally worth it and I bet seeing those faces on those 3 brats was well worth it", "You're forgetting that the 'single parent and her 2 kids' have been getting expensive stuff for years now and literally just got a new phone and ipad from the grandmother. Stop acting like they are the victims here.", "It doesn't matter. It was perfectly logical to prepare this way in advance for when your parents inevitably stuck with their pattern. Anyone could have predicted this would be needed.", "Unbelievable, right? Nobody did anything to hurt the chronically spoiled kids! Apparently, seeing the cousin they teased be comforted is unjustly cruel to put them through.", "I think your husband went a little overboard, but really he just made up for years past. Perhaps you (or her parents) might need to explain to Evelyn that not every holiday is going to be like this one though.\n\nNTA but I'm curious where your father is in all of this?", "If he came prepared in case your mother lied, that makes it even better imo. #powermove", "So true. My brother who is my mums favourite child is a NEET and me, I'm doing far better. My life is far from perfect but I have come out far more successful from him so far.", "It is a mystery that shall never be solved...", "If anything it equals things out, grandparents bought expensive gifts to 2 out of 5? Op husband balanced things, I see no favouritism", "So someone else lost out on their gift?", "I'm with you. The commenter above is essentially upset that you told him, an adult, santa isn't real.", "I'm not upset. I just find comments like yours so unnecessary. You could just read the post and move on.", "I wasn't saying that his response wasn't a great counter to the shitty situation.", "They laughed and were rude to the upset child. Whether they bought it or not they know damn well what was going on and were ok with it. Not cool.", "My father mostly hangs back while my mother runs the household. He was okay as kids. He'd take me and B out and buy us small treats with the instruction to 'not tell S'. He doesn't really stand up for himself.", "A mystery wrapped in an enigma...", "can you include the bot\u2019s username too in the future?  it\u2019s hard to tag and keep track of these users when their comments get deleted.", "Noone lost out on a gift. It was intended for a friend who had managed to get their own. It was being returned and said friend was bought something else.", "lol, losing out on a ps5 isn't the end of the world, unlike the nephews would like you to believe.", "Actually I'm making the point that you don't constantly have to be a cynic and point out minor issues or things you find unbelievable. What do you actually gain from this?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 love the reference.", "You could just read the comment and move on \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Well, your parents relationship is on them; I don\u2019t mean to sound harsh, but your father has allowed you & your children to be emotionally abused, so no sympathy from me there, he\u2019s enabled your Mothers abuse to control the family.  You have no obligation to keep participating in this dysfunctional cycle or to be with family that treats you & your children this way. Create your own traditions & holidays w/o the toxic family members, especially as an example to your children.", "What stores take ps5s back longer than 30 days? Why were you still sitting on it when it was bought \"earlier in the year\"?", "The store has a 180 day return policy as long as the goods are unopened."]}
