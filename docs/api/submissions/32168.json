Dave's oldest three have a brother Josh from the same bio parents. Josh was never adopted by Dave because he was older and remembered his dad. Dave and the kids mom, Anna, divorced after 4 years of marriage. Anna died a few years later. By that point Dave was already dating his current wife Liz (42F). \n\nAfter Dave ended up with full custody of his older kids he tried to cut Josh out of his kids lives. Josh took him to court once he was 18 and the courts ordered Josh and the kids had a right to see each other. He would take them out for a few hours every few weeks and call and see them for birthdays and Christmas.\n\nDave and Liz had two kids together after they married. Dave never got his older kids any therapy/help for all they had been through. So when the younger two were born the older kids struggled and were jealous and resented them. But they were also fearful Dave loved his bio kids more. Dave blamed Josh for this largely. Because Josh never established a relationship with the younger two kids and he would buy stuff for his siblings but not the younger two kids and Dave felt Josh owed them that.\n\nI first started speaking out more firmly about 4 years ago. Liz wanted to adopt the older three and wanted them to call her mom but they were upset at the suggestion and were a very firm no. Liz would press them for why in front of everyone else. When they would say they loved their mom and didn't want to replace her Liz would say \"Oh so Dave's only your dad because you don't remember your bio dad and you don't really love Dave\". It was disgusting. I called her out and told Dave he needed to stop her. But Dave said Liz was hurting and deserved grace.\n\nWhat happened next is where things reached the point of this post. So Dave would try to get the kids to turn against Josh or make him accept their younger siblings. They said the younger kids could not have Josh as well as him (Dave) and Josh is their brother, their real brother. Dave told the kids (all teens now) that if they felt that way then they shouldn't be his kids anymore. Liz told them not accepting her and the kids as mom and siblings meant they never deserved Dave and she was cruel to them. Dave ended up sending the kids to live with Josh and he went entirely no contact/deadbeat dad on the kids.\n\nDave and Liz cry that the kids were awful and after all Dave did and shit like that. I heard this once and I told them they were terrible people and parents. I told Dave he made a promise to his kids and he showed them he never really loved them like his own, and he might have planted insecurity in his bio kids as well.

As their adoptive and legal parent, he has a LEGALLY BINDING OBLIGATION to support them until they are of age.\n\nIn other words, legally he CAN'T just \"\\[send\\] them to live with Josh\" and cut off all financial and other support. He has a legal responsibility to them. \n\nGiven that, if you care as much as you say, why TF haven't you, your parents, or anyone else in these children's lives called CPS or the cops and reported your brother for child abandonment? You say you care so much, and you're going off on your brother for being a bad parent . . . but you literally watched him dump his minor kids on their teenaged (or maybe by now early 20-something) brother and . . . did NOTHING except \"tell him he's a terrible parent\"? Who cares? So you hurt his feelings. How does that put food in those kids' mouths or keep a roof over their heads?\n\nYou're almost as much of an AH as far as I can see, because you claim to care, but you can't even make a single phone call to report your brother and SIL for literally ditching their minor children.\n\nESH.
