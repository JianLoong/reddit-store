They mentioned wanting to dine out for Christmas dinner, but I offered to whip up a home-cooked feast instead. Unfortunately, they turned down the offer.  \nNow, here's where it gets interesting. I am currently working as a server in our town after recently being laid off from my corporate job. Lucky for me, the restaurant is closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas.  \nWell, turns out my mother-in-law had other plans. She called up my workplace without speaking to me beforehand and asked for me to be their server for their entire Christmas dinner. I found out through my husband that I'd be playing the role of their server for their festive family celebration, and my Christmas \"gift\" would be a sweet tip and takeout from my restaurant.  \nSeems a bit odd, especially since our restaurant isn't even open on Christmas Eve or Christmas and I'd be available to spend time with them on those days. They're scheduling this dinner the day before we close and making it their designated family celebration. \n\nI politely declined because, let's be real, being excluded from Christmas dinner while working as their server? That's a hard pass from me. \n\nUnfortunately, I was told that I was being dramatic and there's nothing weird about me being their server for their family's Christmas dinner.

It's honestly appalling that your MIL would assume that you'd want to be working/serving the rest of your family instead of participating in the meal as everybody else is. It's also very concerning that your husband was not immediately offended on your behalf and shutting his mother down.", "NTA. Your in-laws see you as a servant. There's nothing weird about you being their server because then everyone is in their proper place.\n\nYou have a husband problem. He sees you the same as his family sees you. This will not change.  Please do not have children with this arrogant man. \n\nIf you do, your children will be the equivalent of skullery maids and char women.\n\nThere is no way his family isn't laughing about this.

This is a huge slap in your face.\n\nThis would be the last time I hosted them in my home and I'd go LC to NC. They're basically telling you that you aren't good enough for them, so f@ck 'em.", "This is weird that they\u2019ve chosen to celebrate on an alternate day just so you can wait on them.  I\u2019ve worked holidays as both a manager and as a server and it was nice if family or friends came in, but this feels like a very different situation.  If they did this, PLUS a celebration with you on Christmas, I\u2019d think nothing of this, but excluding you and making you be their server for their only celebration is just cruel.  NTA", "NTA. Your husband on the other hand is a major AH for not defending you and saying you should be a guest only for your first holiday dinner with your new family. A \u201ctip\u201d as your gift?  That is simply an expectation to tip your server - especially for working on a holiday you should tip even more generously!  I question your marriage for your husband agreeing to this.", "NTA. How is tipping you a gift? That\u2019s literally basic human decency towards any server. Plus most restaurants have mandatory gratuity\u2019s for large parties, and you would have to share your \u201cgift\u201d with the other staff when you tip out. \n\nSounds like the gift they actually want for Christmas is for you and your husband to separate. \n\nIf your husband was on your side it this, you two could mess with them in all sorts of fun ways. Such as telling your in laws that their Christmas gift is staying in your home. Then when they arrive present an invoice where you charge for showers by the minute, towels, food, blankets etc are all available for rent. When they act offended tell them to stop being dramatic, and that it\u2019s normal for guests get use of the room, not the household amenities.", "NTA AT ALL!!!!\n\nLike wtf, that is a power play for sure! You made a generous offer to feed them on your days off, if they aren't willing to include you in the celebration it is their loss. Hopefully the hubby sees it for what it is and has your back.", "Who told you that? Because that person is full of shit. There is something not just weird but condescending and rude about that arrangement! You are right to turn down this wonderful opportunity.

Or, if not, that you've showed him the responses to this post and put a foot up his ass. NTA", "NTA. This is the wildest MIL power move I've ever heard of.

Yeah...a pre-Christmas Day dinner at my workplace...but with a personal family member server! But you know what? Since I serve other people all day at that place, I really don't think I'd enjoy doing it for visiting family over Christmas. How about we flip your idea just a smidge and instead of a tip and takeout as my gift, instead *you* to act as *my* server! LOL I don't know why I ever consider that as a gift idea before! I'll ask my boss if it would be ok as long as you don't serve anyone else. What do you think? Wouldn't that be so much fun for you!\"", "NTA. My goodness they want to shame you", "NTA.  It definitely is not on.  Not only would it be a hard no.  I would also have a hard no on them even staying with you.

You need to draw this boundary hard and fast and deep.  NTA, and if your husband goes along with their ridiculous shenanigans, you need to consider divorce because that is SO disrespectful I am out of words for it.", "NTA\n\nHave they ever been this tone deaf before? That is all sorts of bizarre. Do they not realize how rude it is for them to do that? You'd be completely excluded from the dinner except for the few moments you'd be taking their orders and bringing them their food.

I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re even in this position.", "They're trying to reinforce and formalize the role they want you have in their family.

They mentioned wanting to dine out for Christmas dinner, but I offered to whip up a home-cooked feast instead. Unfortunately, they turned down the offer.  \nNow, here's where it gets interesting. I am currently working as a server in our town after recently being laid off from my corporate job. Lucky for me, the restaurant is closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas.  \nWell, turns out my mother-in-law had other plans. She called up my workplace without speaking to me beforehand and asked for me to be their server for their entire Christmas dinner. I found out through my husband that I'd be playing the role of their server for their festive family celebration, and my Christmas \"gift\" would be a sweet tip and takeout from my restaurant.  \nSeems a bit odd, especially since our restaurant isn't even open on Christmas Eve or Christmas and I'd be available to spend time with them on those days. They're scheduling this dinner the day before we close and making it their designated family celebration. \n\nI politely declined because, let's be real, being excluded from Christmas dinner while working as their server? That's a hard pass from me. \n\nUnfortunately, I was told that I was being dramatic and there's nothing weird about me being their server for their family's Christmas dinner.

I think in their mind, this is a nice gesture. You get to be there for the dinner, and they give you a big tip. It feels like a win/win to them. I don't think it's malicious, and I don't think they see anything wrong with the idea. I think you're going to have to explain to them why it bothers you. It wouldn't bother me.

Your husband should be standing up to his family and telling them that this is not going to happen.

I thought to myself, am I not a part of the family?", "And the husband who did not stand up for her.", "Ya know, I might've understood if OP was playing hostess in her own home, acting server like, but to schedule the family dinner while OP is working and asking for her to be the server is trashy on the in-laws part.", "Yeah, they are not so subtlety letting you know how they bite your place.\n\nThey don't want to be part of a family meal if you make it. You're not family. If you were, does your husband have to work for his Christmas present?", "I was thinking this too. I\u2019ve had relatives that worked in restaurants. We would sometimes go eat there and ask for them as our server but it was to give them a big tip - not exclude them from a celebration!", "I bet the \"sweet tip\" is 10%, up from their usual 5%.", "Not to mention you pay taxes on tips, so a taxed gift? And who wants takeout from where they work? A homemade Christmas dinner is much better.", "Anybody imagining Nicole Byers from Nailed It saying \"This is WILD!!!\" and just speechless from shock when she sees a disaster of a cake? This is that cake situation. A real \"What in the world is happening here?\" level of weird and confusing.", "They knew exactly what they were doing. Excluding and belittling OP is the point. It\u2019s some dumb hierarchical, pissing on your leg bullshit.\n\nNormally I\u2019d say don\u2019t bother with people like this, but surprising them that \u2018Hey, guess what- I managed to get the night off so I can join you!\u2019  or even \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t work Saturdays / got this Saturday off ages ago\u2019 would be a sweet power move.", "Oh, the MIL has a clue, or she would have backed off when OP objected, instead of gaslighting OP.", "And possibly humiliating her.", "Does anyone else in the family have to earn their gifts? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Husband brought the idea to her instead of shutting it down with his parents!", "> Madison how you feel\n\nVERY curious what this typo was supposed to be!", "But your situation was completely different. This is like you were actually able to get Thanksgiving off for once, but instead your family insisted on changing their entire plan and celebrating a day early so that instead of you spending it with them, they could have it at the restaurant and you wouldn\u2019t be able to join them other than being there to cook & carve, but they\u2019d give you leftovers after.", "How does she get to enjoy this family dinner? By being their server instead of actually spending time with them and being a part of the family dinner. That's an asshole move", "She offered to cook Christmas dinner for the family on the days she has off so they can spend time together at home. That's how and when she would be there for dinner. That's the scenario in which everyone is included and gets to spend time together. Everyone gets to be there. That's win/win.\n\nThey are choosing to have a family dinner on the day she works, at her workplace, demanding that she be their server. She doesn't \"get to be there for the dinner.\" She will not be spending any quality time with them because she will be busy doing all of the things a server has to do on what is probably one of the busiest nights of the year. \n\nHer own Christmas dinner will be *their leftovers* which they consider part of her Christmas gift.\n\nWhich part of that is a nice gesture?", "It wouldn't be a big deal if it was any old Tuesday that they wanted to have OP serve them at the restaurant. It's not okay, in my opinion, when it's a family holiday meal that OP should be able to participate in. They are essentially excluding her from the holiday.", "But they are staying in her home, and refused her offer of a homecooked meal on Christmas Day.  Something is wrong somewhere.", "They switched the day they had their big Christmas dinner so that she couldn't participate as one of them.", "They ***are*** gaslighting you. They went so far out of their way to put you in this God awful, weird as fuck spot. They turned down a HOME COOKED CHRISTMAS DINNER to do this. That's beyond weird, that's insane. Please do not entertain the idea that they're in anyway right.\n\nYou're def NTA and honestly? Run from that family.", "You are being gaslit. I\u2019m a dude and I would be livid if my family tried to do that to a SO.", "Serving your partner, your friends, your family/in-laws isn't the weird part. There's nothing wrong with visiting your loved one at their place of employment and making use of their services. When I worked retail or food service, it was nice to see a friendly face.\n\nBut........ That is not what this is. This is demented. Do you have a poor relationship with the in-laws in general? Is there any reason they can only all gather this particular day before the holiday? Because how you've presented it is that they are choosing to gather for dinner at a time when you will be working not because they have no other options but because they're choosing to... It feels very deliberate and othering. \n\nYour husband really doesn't see anything wrong with or weird about a family gathering while you're going to be on your feet working/servicing them and not able to be a part of the family meal?", "These people do not like, or respect, you.  Let that soak in.\n\nThey do not respect you.\n\nAnd neither does your husband if he doesn't 100% step the fuck up (in a perfect world, without being told) and tell them to go fuck themselves.  If he doesn't do that...  If he didn't do that...  Then he's not only complicit in this behavior and enabling it, but he isn't respecting you either.\n\nDid it soak in?  None of these people, husband included, are respecting you.\n\nSo what do you do?  Stand up, shoulders back, and walk around respecting yourself.  Don't take that garbage.  Know your worth and demand it be honored.", "That's because you ARE being gaslit. How does your  husband feel about this? If he feels any way except deeply insulted on your behalf, you have big problems.", "Certainly hope your husband is on *your* side -- to the extent that he should be telling his family to STFU and get lost.", "There are no words for how insulting it is.\n\nWTF is wrong with your husband, that he does not stand up against such a blatantly disrespectful thing?", "Also your tip is your Xmas present.  Who makes their DIL or child work for their Xmas present.  If you don\u2019t work hard enough does she reduce your present?", "This is really insulting.\n\nI would tell the in-laws that something came up and they can't stay at your home.\n\nNTA.", "Personally, I would let them eat out on their own and would not have them stay at your house nor celebrate with you. \u201cSince it\u2019s not your priority to celebrate Christmas with me, I\u2019ll take a pass on any celebrations with you\u201d", "You're definitely being gaslit.", "I showed this to my husband\u2026he said this is so wrong! Your husband is an ass for not supporting you with NO! You need to let him read all these comments.", "honestly that is totally offensive and lets face it they wont even tip well its a ploy to be shady and rude and you should be offended that your husband isnt sticking up for you.", "This is them telling you directly that you are not part of their family but one of the help. If you had made a meal for them at home then they would have to interact with you like an equal. NTA let this go one and call in sick that day.", "They are gaslighting you.  Stand your ground.  Don't be their server.", "Guess they want the usual \"spit in the food and drink\" combo. Look them in their eyes and dare them to eat the food!", "The takeout is such a kick in the teeth too.  OP's celebratory dinner is leftovers.", "Please do. This may not seem like a hill to die on, but this was a terrible way to treat you. You deserve to have your partner who stand by you, defends you, stands up for you and never lets family bully you. i wish you the best, please keep us updated. I hope things work out.", "Neither of you should be attending this dinner.  They can find somewhere else to stay as well.", "1000%.  This is the most insane request I've ever heard of.  There is no way on earth I would still have a Christmas celebration with the in-laws at all after this.  If your husband supports this idea he doesn't consider you, his wife, to be part of his family.", "Please keep us posted how that goes. NTA. This situations is one of the craziest things I've seen posted here.", "My own dad had a rule, that nobody start eating the meal until the person serving it sat down with us to eat. The table wasn't complete if everyone wasn't there.", "I would be outraged if my family acted racist, classist, and exclusionary toward my partner!", "I'm sorry, but what's wrong with your husband? Why is he OK with this?", "Oh they seen you as a different race. Hell, they see you as a different class, possibly species. Your in-laws are not good people. They are putting you in your place. In your own home you\u2019d be included in the family meal you still serve them. At the restaurant you are reminded that you have no seat at the table, you are only the hired help, they are literally giving you scraps after laboring serving them. A tip is not a gift. A tip is for your labor. You don\u2019t have to work for gifts. If your husband is ok with this and didn\u2019t tell his parents F Off immediately, he is not a good person either. \n\nIf you have children with this man, they will see them the same way. Their full white blooded grandchildren will be treated as royalty and your children always a servants.", "Ayyy! I owe myself a Coke.\n\n> I am also half Mexican and a quarter Native, but I am super fare skinned so not a different race\n\nYeah, I would not presume **_they_** see it that way, too.", "Boom!  There it is.", "Sadly, race is very likely their issue with you, and they are vile for it. How is your husband just standing by and tolerating this?", "Dang! Your in laws are racist! Run! Do not walk away from this family UNLESS your husband is 100% defending you and telling his family how disgusting their suggestion is", "Before anything else, NTA.\n\nI've frequently found with some Stupid White People, it doesn't matter how fair skinned you are. If you have *any* non White Person blood, you aren't white, and that means you're inferior. \n\nIt's time to have a sit down with your husband and explain how demeaning you find this. Don't let him tell you you're being dramatic, or \"that's just how they are,\" or any such rubbish. At some level your in laws see you as inferior and that's not OK.", "Run now, he doesn\u2019t get it and never will. These people are going to degrade you, and probably say some super awful shit to you. Get ready girl, it\u2019s about to be game on. Don\u2019t take the crap, cuz they\u2019ll be slinging it in all kinds of ways. They want you to know you are the \u201chelp\u201d", "Ah, I see. They are racist and classist.\n\nSit down with Husband and tell him this is 100% unacceptable and without a very sincere apology that demonstrates how badly they miss-stepped, you will be no-contact with them and he will need to choose them or you. Make sure he understands how deeply insulting, racist, and classist this action of theirs is.\n\nYou are NTA, but husbands family are a pack of racists.", "Girl, you're a light brown. If they are caucasian (whiteor any other race) then it doesn't matter how light skinned you are, you still brown. \nI still wouldn't be serving them and I'd be supeer pissed at my man for not making it clear that I am his wife and not the family's Cinderella and should be treated with the same respect the other family memebers (asuming they show each other respect).", "Talk to your manager. If the manager is a half way decent person, he will ensure you are not serving them and either have you in a different area, at the counter, or in the kitchen.\n\nAnd then just completely ignore his family.\n\nBy the way....where the FUCK is your husband in all of this? How is he not fighting for you? His family is very obviously and openly doing this to 'put you in your place'. If my family ever did this, I would be slashing tires to make sure the dinner didn't happen.\n\nIf he is one of the people telling you that you are 'overreacting' or 'being dramatic', then you have a huge, huge problem, baby girl, and it's not your in laws...its your husband. His family are creeps, oh well - but your partner should have your back and fight tooth and nail for you.", "Oh dear they do not see it this way\u2026.", "Yup. Whatever \"fun\" there is in having family come visit you at your place of work when you work in food service is pretty much not a thing after you're in your twenties, i.e. not a teen super proud of your first job.  This seems like such a rub it in OP's face that she's \"in service.\"", "What\u2019s the betting their definition of \u201csweet tip\u201d is 10% of the bill", "I love that part.  Her gift is that they pay her for doing her job.  Dolores they usually terrible tippers or something?", "Add to this racist fuckery: she\u2019s the only one in the family who has to earn her gift.\n\nOP, I really hope you show your husband these replies.", "Apparently, they're telling you that they do not consider you to be part of their family. They're obnoxious. Your husband should make them apologize and suggest to them that they should find other accommodations, since they can't treat his wife respectfully.", "To them, no you are not. You are only worthy to be servant to them. They are very calculatedly & purposely putting you in your place. They are reminding you you have no place at their table & should grovel & be thankful for the left over scraps they give you.", "They\u2019re being pretty explicit about what they think of you, and it\u2019s not that you\u2019re family.", "The request is more than out of touch it\u2019s degrading. Almost seems like mother in law wants to make sure you know your place at least that\u2019s the vibe I get. What\u2019s your husbands take on this? Is he okay with you both being made less than the rest and simultaneously excluded from the main family celebration.", "Your husband is just as bad. Why isn't he standing up for you? NTA", "NTA, obviously, and I sincerely hope that you share this thread with your husband. You\u2019re newlyweds, so it\u2019s hard to know for sure what your life with him will look like. I encourage you to take the phrase \u201cwhen people show you who they are, believe them\u201d to heart. If your husband is ok with you being excluded from the holiday celebration and thinks it\u2019s fine for you to have to SERVE his family during their celebration, then you should probably make not being part of that family permanent.", "Info needed:\n\nPeople have  asked in this thread: how exactly did your husband respond to this? \n\nAnd why are you avoiding answering this?  It is the most asked question in this thread.", "Please OP update us on this situation.  None of us find it funny or even fair.  And I think a lot of us are worried about your husband's reaction or lack of.  This problem could be a lot bigger than AH in-laws because if could mean AH hubby too!  Wishing the best for you.", "Yup, you know if he saw anything off with this, OP would have mentioned it in the story.  So he either doesn't see the problem or sees it but won't defend her.  Problems both", "Just another example about how money doesn't buy class.  This is reality TV level trashyness.", "On brand", "Not only that but she has to serve them to get her fecking Christmas gift? This is beyond insulting.", "That\u2019s not what gaslighting is.", "Where is the husband in all of this?", "Not dramatic, not weird, NTA - that's just hideous.", "Can we be the asshole here and give them all laxatives? Fuck.", "Nothing says \"Merry Christmas\" like making someone perform in front of their boss with their family watching. No pressure or anything....", "An annulment is in order. I guess the family doesn't like you?", "And gifts aren't taxes unless they are large (I believe $10,000).  But tips are.  So giving her the money that way, especially on a card, means it will be taxed as regular income.", "Exactly this. They wouldn't be staying at my house, and they would be taking their son with them.", "YUP!", "This is a hill to die on.", "I'm as non confrontational as you can get.  I let everything  go.  I would not let this go.", "The husband is giving off some real ugly stepsister vibes which is a weird thing in a husband", "YEAH. I'm really wondering that.", "If the parents are millionaires, the answer might be inheritance.", "\"They are putting you in your place.\" \n\nThis is it in a nutshell.", "OP, this is the truth. I\u2019m truly sorry you have to face it like, especially during the holiday season, but these people are 100% ignorant and stupid Fs. \n\nI think they think seeing you wait on them is going to finally \u201cwake\u201d your husband up to the \u201cfact\u201d that you\u2019re \u201cbeneath them.\u201d They can go screw themselves. \n\nFurious at your husband. Furious.

Never occurred to me someone wouldn\u2019t consider my kids white, they didn\u2019t consider southern Europeans white. Came as a shock to me.", "Absolutely. And even if it wasn't racism (which it is) it's classism. They think it will be amusing to watch you perform labor they consider beneath themselves.", "I think it's telling that husband's reaction isn't included.  My guess is he didn't see a problem with it", "But the leftovers!", "It's appalling that they even call it a gift. A gift would be an envelope full of cash that she doesn't have to work for. \n\nBut seriously, the *leftover food* as part of the gift is even more insane. \"If you could just pack this up in a doggy bag for yourself, that'd be great, Merry Christmas!\"", "The lack of mention speaks volumes", "The husband was the person who informed her she would be serving the family.

Sounds like they can afford it.", "Probably reveling in the fact OP is laid off from the corporate job and in a \"more fitting\" /s job.", "In fact, this stunt may be specifically because OP feels she is white passing. They want to make it very clear that no matter how fair her skin, no matter how white passing she may appear, she is not white and not being white makes her less than them.", "I mean, if they\u2019re staying at her house, all the leftovers from any meal out are coming home with her regardless. Unless they travel with a personal fridge, which maybe these people do.", "That\u2019s a good point, but I also think that a major component is that she lost her corporate job and is now \u201creduced\u201d (I feel gross writing that) to being a server, and the in-laws are now fully lashing out. \n\nThe in-laws been wealthy makes me think that we\u2019re dealing with both racism and classicism here."]}
