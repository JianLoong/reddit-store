You got the kids the gifts, they're from you! If she wants to paper over their dad's inadequacies in gift-giving, she can buy gifts for the kids and label them as \"from dad\".", "NTA If your sister wants to give guilt gifts to her children from deadbeat daddy and mommy, she needs to do it on her own dime.", "NTA\n\nIf I were you I would still get them gifts but wrap them by yourself and hand them to the children yourself. Your sister is taking advantage of the fact you are doing this by letting her put both their names when they didn\u2019t finical help you pay for them.", "Nta\n\nI'd make sure they are at least labeled with your name.", "Definitely NTA, it sounds like they're a second thought for him instead of a priority, like his kids should be. She needs to accept that he's not helping. Lying to the kids and pretending he's more involved than he is just builds up the letdown when they realize he doesn't care as much as they thought.", "NTA. I'd label them yourself before giving her any gifts", "NTA. The gifts came from you. Presumably, at least your sister got gifts herself and if she wants to add the father\u2019s name to them, that\u2019s her right. But, it\u2019s weird that she would want all of the gifts you brought to be collective ones from all of you.", "NTA.  She\u2019s not doing the kids any favors pretending Dad\u2019s willing to make gestures he\u2019s not actually willing to make.  And if she insists on doing it anyway, she can do it with her own presents.  Not the stuff you bought.", "I'm a single mom of two kids (just sent the \"baby\" off to college). Their dad...yeah...just too much to get into there, but rest assured, I did everything on my own. I did it on my own while still getting mistreated by him because like your sister, I don't like confrontation and tend to be a people pleaser (can sometimes be a side effect of past abuse...was in my case, but another long story).\n\nIt was so hard...emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. I had to rely on help often. Let me tell you what I never did: I never sugar coated Dad's \"involvement\" in anything. Fuck that. Maybe I was bitter, but I busted my ass every day to provide for my kids and went without so damn many times that I was insanely proud of the gifts I could get them, even if it wasn't much. Part of the reason I did that wasn't to make Dad look bad, but because I wanted them to understand the situation so that I could break that generational cycle. I didn't bad-mouth dad, but I also didn't defend him (unless it was the rare occasion where he deserved it). I also didn't take credit for gifts others got my kids, no matter how much better they may have been than what I could afford (my mom would sometimes put my name on gifts, but I asked her to stop and she obliged because it bothered me). I wanted them to know the wide circle of support we had and let the other family get that credit. \n\nKids don't like being lied to and faking presents being from an absentee father is not doing favors for anyone but the absentee father. If there's an agreement, spoken or unspoken, between you and your sister about her name being on the presents from you, that's one thing. His name should be NO WHERE near those gifts unless he paid you for them in some way. She's not shielding the kids from heartbreak (which I know is what she's doing and believe me, I get it); she's lying to them about their reality and setting them up for way worse heartbreak in the future. \n\nNTA. But, I would sit down and have a gentle conversation with your sister about looking at what she probably thinks is minor and see if you can get her to understand that what she's doing isnt for the sake of the kids; it's for the sake of their dad and at this stage, she owes him nothing. \n\nGood luck and you are an awesome sister and awesome auntie!!!", "Nope, NTA. Sorry her baby daddy doesn't contribute to their kids, but that's not right to lie to them acting like YOUR gifts are his.", "NTA\n\nTruth hurts but it's necessary sometimes.", "NTA, why is she putting her name on them let alone his? You paid for those gifts and you should be getting the credit for them.", "NTA but from previous experience your doing so is likely to push your sister away further and stop her confiding in you.  That\u2019s what happens to someone abused already, someone else declares themselves NTA and others support them in these cases.  However the person who is most vulnerable feels even more guilt and withdraws because you don\u2019t support them.  You have done nothing wrong, but accept your sister is also doing the best she can", "NTA, she can put his name on her gifts.", "Why did you spend 2000 on kids for Christmas how many kids?", "NTA, but unless you're there when they open them on Christmas morning, I would wonder if she goes back before they get up and puts \"dad\" and \"mom\" on the ones that she just wrote their names on.", "NTA.\nYou should've included her in this objection. You paid the money for the gifts. Not her. Not the kid's father. \nThere's nothing wrong with standing up for yourself.", "You are definitely NTA\nYour sister and her children should be very happy to have you in their life. You are quite generous towards them.", "NTA she stopped labelling them so she can verbally include him or add it later, my sister did this too. It might be better to just bring gifts wrapped and labelled how you want to on the day to avoid hurt feelings but you 100% said nothing wrong. If she wants to buy gifts to give them from him that\u2019s fine but it shouldn\u2019t be asked/expected of anyone else to buy gifts from him", "NTA but IDK the standard in your family, two grand is an insane amount of money to spend on someone else's children. That would intimidate me if I was the parent and not able to put that kind of money behind it. \n\nKids rarely are able to appreciate that kind of spending anyway. What they value most is time and attention, unfortunately it sounds like they don't get that from their dad either.", "Getting ready for the down votes\u2026\n\nOP, how old are the kids? Is there a chance she added mom and dad to the card so the kids would not think the parents did not love them enough to buy them something? \n\nI know you spent the money on the kids, but you did it because you love them. If those presents can help them feel good about themselves-everyone wants to be loved- isn\u2019t it worth doing. They have plenty of time to understand the harsh realities. By that time maybe a better version of their father will arrive.\n\nSometimes being Santa is thankless, but the eyes aglow, faces lit with 1000watt smiles, and the shrieks of excitement make anonymity worth it.

Well one year my mom bought my cousins tons of gifts for Christmas and without her knowledge my aunt told my cousins she bought them everything and my parents gave them nothing!

Not cool.", "I hear where you\u2019re coming from, but I think it sets up unreasonable expectations. Kids will feel loved by whoever is in their lives. Putting \u201cdaddy\u201c on something doesn\u2019t really mean anything if he is never there.", "Man I'm sure I'll be down voted with you but thank you for saying it. If these were presents for adults, or even teenagers, that would be different. But they're kids. The gift of feeling loved is so much more valuable to their social and emotional development than whatever the presents actually are. Your sister isn't putting dad's name on the presents so he gets \"credit,\" she's doing it to shelter them from everything that man lacks.\nThey have their whole lives to feel disappointed in him, and buying them some time to grow in strength and wisdom before they have to shoulder that burden is such an act of love. Gift them the experience of innocence and joy a little longer. You're doing it because you love them, right, not because you want them to love you?", "I hear what you're saying, but for me the better way for the mom to go would be to ask her sister if the sister would give her some money with which to buy the kids presents. As it stands, the mom isn't even asking the aunt if she's OK with this deception.", "NTA. But, OP, you might want to pull back here a little and not spend so much on gifts if it isn't appreciated. You should get credit for the things you buy, and I can guarantee she'll still tell the kids a lot of these gifts are from him...", "NTA. If your sister doesn't want them all to be from you and you are cool with it have them come from Santa.", "Nta, question though did you know she was planning to put the gifts were from you and her? Then she added the baby father. Or you didn\u2019t know she was gonna add herself and baby father?", "NTA and I hope you re-labeled the ones she already labeled. Wtf?", "NTA. The presents (and the money and time you spent on them) are an expression of your love for your niblings and your sister. Putting someone else's name on them is disrespectful to you. \n\nAnd don't think the kids won't notice either. When you are younger who gave you what blends together, but when you get older you realise that it's always one parent at the shops buying things, wrapping presents, making cakes, planning parties, not the other... Hard to believe that Dad cares when it's always Mum's handwriting on your birthday cards.", "NTA she and her baby daddy didn't buy those gifts. She is a grown as women. You are not a after thought.

She doesn't want you standing up for her that's fine, but you're still not letting him walk all over you.", "Exactly, she\u2019s just going to write his name on it after op leaves.

No disrespect to sis, but if it\u2019s that important she needs to get him to either give money for gifts or pay for gifts \u201cfrom him\u201d with her own money.

That\u2019s kind of weird they should be buying their own gifts for their kids", "NTA- I actually think there's a kind of danger in making the kids think their father does more than he really does. I'm not saying you make a point to loudly announce on Christmas 'Aaaaand nothing from your dad cos he's a deadbeat a-hole', but if there's not some expectation management those kids are going to end up getting hurt.", "NTA - if you don't pay for the gifts you don't get to add your name to the tag.

She was trying to avoid a fight with baby daddy, by creating a fight with you.\n\nThat\u2019s rough, it sucks and I\u2019m sorry. Hopefully she\u2019ll recognise that Christmas is happening because of auntie and change her attitude but I would t count on it!", "Also, people like your sister are manipulative and good for you for standing up for yourself.

They'd rather hurt their loved ones than making a third party uncomfortable. Sister volunteers OP for people pleasing. It's not about not upsetting anyone, it's about only upsetting the ones that don't push back in favour of not upsetting the ones that do.", "Yeah, exactly I thought so too, if she is so non confrontational than why would she do this, you said it better than I could, she\u2019s got no problem basically confronting OP by mislabeling her gifts. OP, definitely NTA.", "this is people pleasing, you prioritise the ones that are hardest to please because its often impossible to please everyone and this way there's the least amount of backlash, but the goal overall is to make *everyone* happy (hence stopping labelling gifts when OP got upset).\n\nsource - spent a lot of time doing this while growing up.\n\nI'm guessing in her mind it was a trade between 'OP gets less credit' vs 'kids are upset their parents didn't get them gifts' . Reasonable to prioritise the kids there even while caring about OP. The more confrontational solutions of asking OP if she can do this vs explaining their financial hardship to the children wouldn't have crossed her mind.", "NTA but you might want to take a step back.

Ex for a reason lol", "NTA and I found out that the gifts for my sisters kids that I left at my parents house for them were almost always relabeled by the parents as from them.
