I'd label them yourself before giving her any gifts", "NTA. The gifts came from you. Presumably, at least your sister got gifts herself and if she wants to add the father\u2019s name to them, that\u2019s her right. But, it\u2019s weird that she would want all of the gifts you brought to be collective ones from all of you.", "NTA.  She\u2019s not doing the kids any favors pretending Dad\u2019s willing to make gestures he\u2019s not actually willing to make.  And if she insists on doing it anyway, she can do it with her own presents.  Not the stuff you bought.", "I'm a single mom of two kids (just sent the \"baby\" off to college). Their dad...yeah...just too much to get into there, but rest assured, I did everything on my own. I did it on my own while still getting mistreated by him because like your sister, I don't like confrontation and tend to be a people pleaser (can sometimes be a side effect of past abuse...was in my case, but another long story).\n\nIt was so hard...emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. I had to rely on help often. Let me tell you what I never did: I never sugar coated Dad's \"involvement\" in anything. Fuck that. Maybe I was bitter, but I busted my ass every day to provide for my kids and went without so damn many times that I was insanely proud of the gifts I could get them, even if it wasn't much. Part of the reason I did that wasn't to make Dad look bad, but because I wanted them to understand the situation so that I could break that generational cycle. I didn't bad-mouth dad, but I also didn't defend him (unless it was the rare occasion where he deserved it). I also didn't take credit for gifts others got my kids, no matter how much better they may have been than what I could afford (my mom would sometimes put my name on gifts, but I asked her to stop and she obliged because it bothered me). I wanted them to know the wide circle of support we had and let the other family get that credit. \n\nKids don't like being lied to and faking presents being from an absentee father is not doing favors for anyone but the absentee father. If there's an agreement, spoken or unspoken, between you and your sister about her name being on the presents from you, that's one thing. His name should be NO WHERE near those gifts unless he paid you for them in some way. She's not shielding the kids from heartbreak (which I know is what she's doing and believe me, I get it); she's lying to them about their reality and setting them up for way worse heartbreak in the future. \n\nNTA. But, I would sit down and have a gentle conversation with your sister about looking at what she probably thinks is minor and see if you can get her to understand that what she's doing isnt for the sake of the kids; it's for the sake of their dad and at this stage, she owes him nothing. \n\nGood luck and you are an awesome sister and awesome auntie!!!", "Nope, NTA. Sorry her baby daddy doesn't contribute to their kids, but that's not right to lie to them acting like YOUR gifts are his.", "NTA\n\nTruth hurts but it's necessary sometimes.", "NTA, why is she putting her name on them let alone his? You paid for those gifts and you should be getting the credit for them.", "NTA but from previous experience your doing so is likely to push your sister away further and stop her confiding in you.  That\u2019s what happens to someone abused already, someone else declares themselves NTA and others support them in these cases.  However the person who is most vulnerable feels even more guilt and withdraws because you don\u2019t support them.  You have done nothing wrong, but accept your sister is also doing the best she can", "NTA, she can put his name on her gifts.", "Why did you spend 2000 on kids for Christmas how many kids?", "NTA, but unless you're there when they open them on Christmas morning, I would wonder if she goes back before they get up and puts \"dad\" and \"mom\" on the ones that she just wrote their names on.", "NTA.\nYou should've included her in this objection.

You are quite generous towards them.", "NTA she stopped labelling them so she can verbally include him or add it later, my sister did this too. It might be better to just bring gifts wrapped and labelled how you want to on the day to avoid hurt feelings but you 100% said nothing wrong.

That would intimidate me if I was the parent and not able to put that kind of money behind it. \n\nKids rarely are able to appreciate that kind of spending anyway. What they value most is time and attention, unfortunately it sounds like they don't get that from their dad either.", "Getting ready for the down votes\u2026\n\nOP, how old are the kids? Is there a chance she added mom and dad to the card so the kids would not think the parents did not love them enough to buy them something? \n\nI know you spent the money on the kids, but you did it because you love them. If those presents can help them feel good about themselves-everyone wants to be loved- isn\u2019t it worth doing. They have plenty of time to understand the harsh realities.

The gift of feeling loved is so much more valuable to their social and emotional development than whatever the presents actually are. Your sister isn't putting dad's name on the presents so he gets \"credit,\" she's doing it to shelter them from everything that man lacks.\nThey have their whole lives to feel disappointed in him, and buying them some time to grow in strength and wisdom before they have to shoulder that burden is such an act of love.

Why else would she put her name on them?", "INFO: Do you have any reason to believe that your sister is in potential danger from the baby father? If she's doing it selfishly that's one thing, but if she's being coerced by him that would be another. I don't want to minimize her actions or shift blame, but deadbeat fathers can be type.", "Sorry, but she's also the ass for putting her own name on your gifts. You are NTA", "NTA and I'd recommend that your sister not try to cover for her deadbeat BF. I've been there and thought it would be easier for my kids if they thought their father cared enough to send bday/Christmas gifts. I had planned the 1st Christmas without him to label some gifts as from him. My mom mentioned that by me doing this, it is setting up their expectations later in life that he is something he isn't and that it's easier that they realize when they're still younger, vs them thinking he stopped caring once they got older and knew it wasn't him. I'm so thankful for that advice. He occasionally remembers to send money for a birthday here and there and if he does, I tell that child that he sent it and it goes into their savings. I also never mention anything until he has actually sent it as there has been many times he has asked what they'd like and never sent anything at all. They have learned not to expect anything and are pretty nonchalant about receiving anything from him now. I'm sure it would've been devastating for them when he doesn't send anything had they thought he always had in the past.", ">neither one of them contributed to these gifts and I spent nearly two grand on everything\n\nINFO\n\nHow old are these kids and what sort of stuff did you buy? A thousand dollars for Christmas gifts is an insane amount to spend on a single occasion. I'm a parent and that sounds like too much.", "Nta. The only person who gets any credit for anything we buy for Christmas is Santa. They ain't it.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou said it somewhat gently and you feel bad for it, but what she was doing was actively hurtful and also really misrepresenting the situation. Lying to children like that does not help.\n\nThe long term effect of doing it might even be worse. \"Why does daddy send us so many gifts but he never remembers picking them out? Why did daddy get us so many gifts but wasn't even at the Christmas?\" Don't lie to kids. It messes with their heads. There are more complicated things at play and they're not stupid.", "Does it matter in the end? I don't know, I gave my sister money for her kid's Christmas and as far as the kids are concerned, the gifts are from her. I don't need credit or for the kids to know that I paid for it all. I would be pretty pissed if their loser fathers got any credit, though. Even though, it might be better for their mental health to not know what type of person their father is", "YTA. This isn\u2019t - or shouldn\u2019t be - about which adult\ngets credit. This is about the children. How do you think they will feel to see no gifts from their father?  He may be a deadbeat, but this will only cause them pain. Set your ego aside and let them feel loved by everyone for one day. It isn\u2019t hard. Your sister understands this. In your effort to get all the credit, you hurt your sister and her children. Was it worth it?", "NTA.  Your sister had no right to do that and it's worse that she's now pouting about it.  She needs to grow up and be grateful for all you do.", "Ever hear of punctuation?", "NTA - she is stealing from you.", "My mom is like this. If she\u2019s scared of upsetting someone she\u2019ll go to great lengths to keep them happy. If she knows you\u2019ll be nice she doesn\u2019t care about your feelings.", "Yeah these \"parents\" definitely have no gifts for their kids.", "Unlikely. Saying brought instead of bought is a common mistake in the UK", "Nope. They are supporting the results of their recreational sex by using OP.  I'm sure the sister and the baby daddy are working this together.", "Nta you bought those gifts", "INFO: do you guys live together? Can you wrap the gifts at your own home, label them, and not bring them over til it\u2019s time for the kids to open them?", "They need to buy their own gifts.", "NTA... gifts should be truthful.  If the grow up thinking these people supported them they will suffer dissapointment when they discover these people dont care.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t get credit just because he exists.", "NTA.  What your sister did was so beyond the pale trashy.  She wants her children to artificially love their father so she's throwing you, your time, and your money under the bus to accomplish that.  Next time, being the gifts Christmas day and make sure they have your name on them.", "Yes!  Also, I'd watch out that the labels with just the kids names will be edited once OP leaves and dad will end up with credit in the end.", "Yes, I regularly give the kids gifts from our dogs. In truth, they are terrible freeloaders who never contribute a dime.", "Not next time. OP spent $2k on these gifts!! If I were OP I would bring them over Christmas day all with the same unusual wrapping paper and my name all over them", "NTA.  It was incredibly RUDE of your sister to even put her name, let alone her BF's name on gifts that they did not contribute any money towards.  I would suggest that next year you wrap & label your own presents and bring them over when y'all exchange gifts to avoid this in the future.", "NTA but have pity on your sis. She want trying to give him credit, she was trying to give them the illusion that their dad cares about them which is not inherently wrong. The kids will eventually figure it out. She just wants the kids not to experience the hurt they will feel when there are no gifts from dad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Spelling", "**Question; why is it ok for your sister to put her name on it then? This is a double standard.**\n\nLike she wasn\u2019t the person who got them, you were! All the labels should say \u201cfrom aunt n\u201d and neither parent should be getting credit for it, because neither of them contribute. Don\u2019t only be mad that she\u2019s putting deadbeat dads name on the gifts, be mad that she\u2019s putting herself on there too!", "Nope. She\u2019s quiet as she was rightfully called out.\n\nShe can live in lala land by herself. Don\u2019t enable that crap.\n\nNTA.", "Absolutely not.  I'd be super pissed of other people were getting the credit for the gifts I put thought, effort and money into buying.  Let her be generous with her own time, effort and money.\n\nYour sister is taking you for granted.  Wrap and label their presents yourself next time.  Actually, you should be present when they open them because I wouldn't trust her not to switch out the tags.  NTA", "She didn't finish labeling them because she is just going to finish putting his and her name on them. Wrap your own gifts that you bought and hand write your own name as giver. I would go back and change every damn one myself but I would have never let that slide.", "NTA- she shouldn't be lying to her kids and letting them think their father bought them gifts!", "NYA\u2014but spending 2k on Christmas gifts for two babies is madness (unless you are married to Elon Musk or Bill Gates)! Watch that you don\u2019t spend all your money on your sister\u2019s family and make sure you are save for retirement.", "NTA. \n\nCan\u2019t understand why his name featured on the tags in the first place\u2026!", "NTA , I\u2019ve been on her end. I bought gifts and have put other\u2019s names on them because I didn\u2019t want the kids knowing. But if you bought them, it\u2019s up to you on if you want that happening", "YTA. I lost my husband in July. If someone tried to pull this crap on me I\u2019d completely cut them out of my life. How insensitive can you be?", "In That Order!", "This right here.  How is OP just glossing over this fact?  Is she just so used to her sister taking advantage of her?", "NTA If she wants to lie to the kids and let them think he actually thought of them she can buy gifts \"from dad\" herself. From now on, wrap the gifts to the kids yourself and give them directly to the kiddos yourself so they know they're from you and not them. If she needed the extra help for gifts from her, she could have asked.", "NTA. ~~Mommy, Daddy and~~  Auntie (fixed it)", "NTA, maybe you should take a pause on the financial support you are providing. Next time she mentions something the children 'need'. Tell her your finances ate tight right now. She needs to become more aware if how helpful you are. However,  do not say anything about baby daddy, that will start drama.", "NTA. Obviously, I don\u2019t know the whole story, but I wonder if he\u2019s gotten angry with her for not giving the kids gifts in his name in the past. Her attitude here seems like she\u2019s been hurt about it before. Like she didn\u2019t mean to step on your toes but desperately wanted to appease him somehow. \n\nI really think you need to talk to your sister to make sure she\u2019s okay. And that her children\u2019s father is not manipulating her. It could be that she simply wanted her kids to feel remembered and loved by him, but there\u2019s no harm in checking it isn\u2019t something more.", "NTA.  Your name is the only name that should be on the gifts.", "NTA you paid, end of, but 2k\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33", "And that amount likely exacerbates the resentment, OP should spend a more reasonable amount to help themselves", "The difference is your husband died but this man is just a deadbeat who doesn\u2019t contribute to his kids.", "Exactly. I've never heard of it being done any other way. This is a total set-up by OP's sister.", "It seems like op\u2019s sister didn\u2019t buy the kids gifts at all. She\u2019s just adding her name to them.", "NTA You need to realise that your sister might not stand up to the baby daddy, but she is very good at getting angry with you, and manipulating you. If she can walk all over you, she can stand up to the baby daddy. You are spending far too much money to have no recognition for what you have contributed. It sounds like you are spending way too much money over all in any case. Do you do far too much? Should you be letting her stand on her own two feet?", "NTA \n\nyour sister sux", "Feels like theres more to this.  If you are spending 2k on gifts for nieces and nephews, im assuming thats more than mom is spending which is super rude.  So was this not a \"helping you buy gifts this year\" situation?", "NTA", "Very nicely stated!  And, of course, NTA", "Thank you. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99"]}
