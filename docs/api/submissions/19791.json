The thing is, I don\u2019t really care of either of them. I\u2019ve never been close with them growing up and have always kept a wall. They both live at home, have a million \u201cissues\u201d to why they can\u2019t be bothered to work to the point my parents stopped trying. My sister has some health problems (mental and physical) and needs contest attention and basically hand holding caretaking for reasons she refuses to seek medical attention for. Long story short, my parents saw how attentive and caring I was to my partner during his final weeks and told her how much I can do for her without discussing it with me. I had to be the bearer of bad news and put them both down and tell them I don\u2019t want either of them living with me and would rather not take care of another adult.

Your parents saw an opening to get rid of one of their two adult children who refuse to grow up.   Not your circus, not your monkeys.", "I'm so sorry for your loss and appalled that your family would take your grief and loss as an opportunity to dump on you. If you do need company, I suggest a dog. Or three. NTA", "NTA - no way at all! Firstly - sorry for your loss. Secondly, Sounds a lot like your parents have had enough of babysitting adults and want to flog it off on you! They\u2019re not your burden to carry! Id change your phone number and take yourself a vacation! No one needs that kind of baggage when you\u2019re grieving!", "NTA - you need and deserve the space to grieve and to grow for yourself.\n\nYour parents are being opportunistic and trying to palm their responsibilities off onto you, their one success story - and it\u2019s extremely assholish of them to do that to you at a time when you should be receiving rather than giving any support the family has to spare.\n\nHang onto your independence and use your evident strength to stop the rest of your family dragging you down.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss - i hope your family don\u2019t manage to overburden you.", "NTA, they are not your responsibility, and especially not while you're grieving the death of your partner. My condolences, OP. I hope you're able to form healthy boundaries away from them.", "NTA. You know this.  Despicable that they're using the loss of your partner to manipulate you into taking care of somebody that is NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY in any way. They can hire a home care person if they need help. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, you deserve all the solitude you want and need to heal and decide where you're headed next in life.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry for your loss and this is so disturbing that your family would think like that.", "NTA. \n\nit's a bit concerning that your parents were eager to throw your siblings at you. but that's the thing.. they're your siblings. being a parent and being a sibling are two drastically different roles. \n\nI hope you're able to find peace.", "NTA\n\nSorry about your loss OP. No way you would be an asshole. Your parents are trying to get rid of what they consider a burden to them under the guise of helping you. You are not responsible for your siblings and have every right not to want to take either one in. Mental and physical problems or not. Your life, your choices.", "Wow. I'm sorry for your loss. That's a tough subject. In reality in shouldn't have even gone this far. Your parents suggested an idea and it wasn't compatible for you. That should have been the end of it.  \n\n\nThere's some serious dysfunction going on back at home. I don't blame you one bit for taking your stance. I don't know many details but I do know you're absolutely NTA. The conversation should have ended a long time ago. I think you are well aware why it didn't, and for that, I don't know or can speak of your family. You're not an asshole, but that's it. I can't say any more. You sound way more mature than I am, so I suggest you keep on doing what you think is best for you.", "Wow. Absolutely NTA!\n\nAlso, unless you really want to keep your partner's home, I'd sell it and move AND change my number. They say you're the reason your family is dysfunctional, and why your siblings \"failed to launch,\" so why would they want their other kids around you? If you're so bad, they should be doing everything to cut ties with you. The fact is that they're the reason you're \"anti family\" and also the reason why your siblings are a mess. They can't admit that so they blame you.", "NTA. Your parents are overwhelmed and thought they could off load some of their burden on you. But your siblings are not your responsibility. Your parents are just trying to guilt you in to it", "NTA, you're still grieving and in no position to take on the responsibility of anybody else right now. Your siblings are not your children, it is not your job to look after them.\n\nI'm terribly sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You do your life not to mention the grieving period. Parent's are AH for assuming they can hand off their non-productive kids on you.", "NTA and your parents have to learn better boundaries. These are THEIR kids. They are the only ones who should be concerned for them. And it's beyond selfish of them to impose this on you, while you are still grieving.

Your parents are TAs for expecting that of you.\n\nI will say you come off as an AH in general though. \"lone wolf\" and \"blazed my own trail\" are often phrases used by people who tend to not acknowledge other people's contributions. it's your right not to want to take care of your siblings, but the way you talk about them as if they have nothing to contribute just rubs me the wrong way.\n\nanyways, none of that matters for my vote though. NTA.\n\nE: typo", "NTA change your phone number and change your locks if there are any spare keys with your family.", "NTA.", "Nta. Sorry for your loss but you need to stand firm in this one. They just want to send your sister to be with you because they don't want to take care of her. While I feel bad for your sister she not your children not your responsible.", "NTA. Don't let your parents foist their parenting problems off on you. Tell them all it's a firm no and you'll need to end the call/leave the chat/head home each time they bring it up. Then practice 10-20 times until they get it. Prepare to go low contact. Re-key your house and never share your keys.", "NTA \nIt's not your responsibility to house and look after (possibly full time care) for a sibling. Sure they're family and people may argue that but at the same time you are not responsible for them. \n\nI'm so sorry you have lost your partner but looking after someone you love in their final time and a sibling is very different. \n\nI'm also very much the lone-person type and I like my space to be mine as people are exhausting to me. \n\nMaybe get a pet if you did want the company of something but not another human. If you need it get some counselling to help with grief, you may not need it but therapy can be great.", "NTA-Your parents couldn\u2019t give one fifth of a half eaten shit about you needing company. They see you as an  easy way to take care of their children and make their lives easier. \n\n\nYou are not responsible for your siblings failure to launch nor the reason your family is dysfunctional.

If they continue to lay guilt trips on you simply say 'we have had this conversation and my answer is still No Way. Please drop the subject. If you continue to press the issue I will go no contact with you until January 2024'.\n\nI'm so very sorry for the loss of your partner. Sending much love your way X", "NTA, obviously.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. It sounds like your parents are trying to palm off the care of one of their children onto you and somehow dressing it up as it being for your own good. You are not responsible for your siblings, you're also fucking grieving and need space to do that. Jesus. Have a word with your parents, this isn't on.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Seriously...how fucking low. Instead of actually seeking to comfort OP in their grief, they just thought they saw a golden opportunity to get rid of at least one of their self-imposed burdens and hoped OP wouldn't be in the right state of mind to refuse.
