Change your number. You owe them nothing.", "I think the answer depends on your view of what your obligations are to your family (i.e., your parents and your siblings).  \n\nFor your parents, I imagine that they are exhausted from caring after their three children (you for however many years you lived under their care, and your 2 siblings for 34 years) and they probably would like some rest at their age (assuming they\u2019re in their 60s or older).  Of course, it\u2019s entirely within their right to be a little more \u201cselfish\u201d and force your siblings to move out on their own.  Theoretically, it\u2019s very easy; but not so easy when you have been in the provider/caretaker role for so long especially when one of your children has health issues.  Somehow, many parents can never escape the feeling of being responsible for their children and their successes and misfortunes.  I agree it\u2019s not right for them to try to guilt you into sharing their burden, but I think the message is that perhaps the burden is getting too heavy for them.  \n\nFor your siblings, it\u2019s probably not easy being them either.  You didn\u2019t include many details about them, but if they are still living with their parents, I am guessing they are not yet financially independent.  Obviously, it\u2019s not easy being your sister with various ailments.  I would posit also that it\u2019s not easy being your younger brother, having to grow up with a sister like that.  Again, to be clear, I don\u2019t mean that you have any sort of obligation to take care of them, but it is possible to view them with a more sympathetic lens.\n\nWhat you do with your parents and siblings is entirely up to you.  No one can judge you for whatever you decide to do with your family, since only you know the full story.  One thing I do always try to remember about family is that they are the only people that impose unrealistic obligations on each other\u2026.but they do so only because they are the only people who might actually come through for each other.  If you got sick or became homeless, is there anyone that would take you in and take care of you?  For some, they would say it\u2019s their family.  For others, they know their family would not.
