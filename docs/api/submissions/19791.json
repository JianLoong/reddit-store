Please make sure you prioritize yourself, give yourself space and grace for your own grief and healing. \n\nThere\u2019s likely many reasons why your parents are trying this approach, but trying to rationalize any of them would be bore as they don\u2019t matter. What matters is you and what you need. Your siblings are a separate matter and not your responsibility. At all. \n\nYou are not being selfish. You being a caretaker for your partner does not mean you need to take on the burdens of others, especially at this time in your life.\n\nHoping you can surround yourself with people who support you, give you the space you need, and wishing you the best.", "NTA, and it\u2019s super fucked up on your parents part to use grief as a manipulation tactic to try to get you to parent one of their adult children\u2026 it\u2019s actually quite disgusting\u2026 I think you have the right idea changing your number", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. How close do you live to your family? Close enough that would try to just dump one of them on you?  Definitely change the locks, at the very least.\n\nBlaming you for the family issues? You know that is ridiculous, right?", "NTA! I\u2019m sorry for your loss. And I\u2019m sorry that your family is not supporting you in your time of need. You obviously are going to do so differently. I thought at first that maybe they were worried about you and wanted someone there for you to keep an eye out. But you seem like you know what you need. That you\u2019ve accepted that your partner is gone. Now you just need to be alone and deal with the outcome of it all. Being alone again. Bless you. And don\u2019t let anyone bully you!", "NTA\n\nYour adult siblings are not your responsibility....", "NTA\n\nAnd since we are talking about foreign expressions to say \"you have nothing to do with that dumpster fire over there\", let me use one from my own native language:  \n\"It is not your mud\"", "NTA,  but when you typed \u201clone wolf\u201d type and frequently blazed my own trail \n\nthat shit was funny af", "Please stand your ground, OP.
