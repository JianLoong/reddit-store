My sister has some health problems (mental and physical) and needs contest attention and basically hand holding caretaking for reasons she refuses to seek medical attention for.

My condolences, OP. I hope you're able to form healthy boundaries away from them.", "NTA. You know this.  Despicable that they're using the loss of your partner to manipulate you into taking care of somebody that is NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY in any way.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss and this is so disturbing that your family would think like that.", "NTA. \n\nit's a bit concerning that your parents were eager to throw your siblings at you. but that's the thing.. they're your siblings. being a parent and being a sibling are two drastically different roles. \n\nI hope you're able to find peace.", "NTA\n\nSorry about your loss OP. No way you would be an asshole. Your parents are trying to get rid of what they consider a burden to them under the guise of helping you.

That's a tough subject. In reality in shouldn't have even gone this far. Your parents suggested an idea and it wasn't compatible for you.

I don't know many details but I do know you're absolutely NTA. The conversation should have ended a long time ago.

Your parents are TAs for expecting that of you.\n\nI will say you come off as an AH in general though. \"lone wolf\" and \"blazed my own trail\" are often phrases used by people who tend to not acknowledge other people's contributions. it's your right not to want to take care of your siblings, but the way you talk about them as if they have nothing to contribute just rubs me the wrong way.\n\nanyways, none of that matters for my vote though.

They just want to send your sister to be with you because they don't want to take care of her. While I feel bad for your sister she not your children not your responsible.", "NTA. Don't let your parents foist their parenting problems off on you. Tell them all it's a firm no and you'll need to end the call/leave the chat/head home each time they bring it up. Then practice 10-20 times until they get it. Prepare to go low contact. Re-key your house and never share your keys.", "NTA \nIt's not your responsibility to house and look after (possibly full time care) for a sibling. Sure they're family and people may argue that but at the same time you are not responsible for them. \n\nI'm so sorry you have lost your partner but looking after someone you love in their final time and a sibling is very different. \n\nI'm also very much the lone-person type and I like my space to be mine as people are exhausting to me. \n\nMaybe get a pet if you did want the company of something but not another human. If you need it get some counselling to help with grief, you may not need it but therapy can be great.", "NTA-Your parents couldn\u2019t give one fifth of a half eaten shit about you needing company. They see you as an  easy way to take care of their children and make their lives easier. \n\n\nYou are not responsible for your siblings failure to launch nor the reason your family is dysfunctional.

It sounds like your parents are trying to palm off the care of one of their children onto you and somehow dressing it up as it being for your own good.

Not to mention the fact that your parents are basically trying to push their burden of your siblings onto you!! I actually find a quite disgusting!!\n\nP.S. Sorry for your loss!! I honestly would\u2019ve probably went low contact to no contact with not only the siblings, but my parents as well.
