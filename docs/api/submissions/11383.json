However, how she conducted the meeting was completely unprofessional and inappropriate, and it should be followed up on.\n\nETA: If I understood what OP said at the bottom, it has already affected the child as she did not have positive things to say about the kid. I'm not saying that OP doesn't have a bias on how great his kid is, but the incident does seem to have colored the teacher's vision of the child. This definitely be reported. This woman needs help!", "Wait, why shouldn't her boss know their employees' behavior if OP deems that behavior inappropriate? It may prevent it from happening to someone else.", "It\u2019s not about resources. It\u2019s about professionalism. Teachers complain that people don\u2019t treat them like professionals. That means they need to act like professionals. That means acting appropriately and being accountable.", "Would bet large sum this is a high cost of living area and that, relatively, 75k is on the lower end of what most people living there make per year.", "Let\u2019s put that 6k in perspective for the people standing in the back.  You are correct in your assessment that they are still underpaid.  That\u2019s not the salary of a young teacher.  Depending on the state, that could be the total salary of a teacher who has probably been teaching 16+ years and has been required to get a masters degree (with the accompanying student loans) in order to keep their certification.  Once you hit the top of the pay scale, all you get is COLA increases.  There are no raises unless they are bargained.  Even the raises barely make a dent.\n\nAlso, if we assume almost 30% of that money is hacked off for taxes, it\u2019s not that much take home pay for a hell of a lot of work.  I worked 12-16 hour days for that pay.  No overtime.\n\nAs for the \u201cgenerous\u201d pension, I\u2019m the poster child to show how much this has changed.  I started teaching in 1987 in OR with a Tier 1 retirement.  I taught 15 years and moved to WA, Tier 3.  After 25 years, I moved back to OR and added 2.5 more years to that retirement account.  I quit teaching in 2021 (not retired\u2014I quit).  There were a couple years in there where I took a break to earn my masters degree.\n\nRecap:  17.5 years in OR in Tier 1.  15 years in WA in Tier 3.\n\nMy monthly retirement income from OR will be almost 4x than my income from WA (when I do start drawing retirement).  Neither is enough to cover living expenses on their own. If I combine OR with SS it would be enough for me if I were single (DH has a poor retirement savings due to a number of factors, some of which were out of his control). I taught close to the same number of years in each state (15 v. 17.5), but that\u2019s how bad the retirement pension is in WA\u2014one of the better paying states, mind you. The younger teachers in OR now have the same kind of pension plan as WA, so everyone who started teaching in the 90\u2019s won\u2019t have enough retirement income after 30-40 years of teaching.  They will need SS and at least one supplementary retirement plan to just pay monthly expenses.\n\nSo\u2026..I taught for 32.5 years and my top salary when I retired was $74,600.  I have a Bachelors, a Masters, and an additional 322 graduate level course credits beyond the masters degree.  Name a profession with that much experience and education, working 60+ hours a week, that earns that low of a salary and I\u2019ll argue that that person is way underpaid for their expertise.\n\nNo whining, just facts.  A friend of mine with 40 years in education is making more as a math tutor than she did as a public school teacher.  That\u2019s an exceptionally talented teacher who is not in a classroom.  If folks want to antagonize teachers to the point that they quit their jobs, they\u2019d better be ready for the consequences that will follow.", "Where did it say that?", "Yeah she chose to be a teacher, and thank god because the teacher shortage is so bad you no longer even need a degree in some states. You don't know that she chose the meeting time, these conferences are mandatory, and it sounds like the schedule was generated by the school.\n\nShe was in conferences with other parents, how tf could she have time to reply to his emails?\n\nShe probably left out the fact she was late because she STILL SHOWED UP WITHIN THE TIMEFRAME and it's expected that a lot of parents will cause previous conferences to go long because they can't shut up about their precious angels.\n\nMeanwhile, OP has the audacity to act like his day is always as bad as what the teacher is going through??

I never assume that it will all wrap up exactly on time, and I leave at least an hour buffer before any other meetings.\n\nThis teacher could have smoothed things over by apologizing, but you could also have extended some grace for a rare conference with the person who spends 6+ hours a day nurturing your child. She's not your employee; she's your partner in educating your child. Instead of building a bridge here, you burned it with vengeance.\n\nYTA", "....so you admit even your own meeting went over the time?", "You could have emailed her to schedule the original appointment at a different time, they would have gladly changed it.\n\nIf it took 35 min then still YTA- conferences are usually 15-20 minutes, so you probably took longer than the parents before you that made her late in the first place. But I'm sure whatever you had to talk about was more important.", "I can guarantee she did not get paid for coming in on her day off, and chances are incredibly slim that she was paid for any of the conferences to begin with.", "Lol, okay", "Not at all. The teacher had appointments that ran over and backed up her day, exactly like what happens in  doctor's offices. I've never had a doctor email me in the waiting room to apologize or reschedule. If it's a longer than average wait, my doctor will apologize and explain the busy day and we move on with the appointment and our lives. \n\nOP was a graceless asshole about it because he looks down on her profession.", "Blah blah blah - someone who has not worked in a school setting in 2023.", "have you been to a dr lol", "We should probably be more concerned that our teachers days are stretched so thin that they don't have time to eat? Like when I was a kid we had parapros that watched us at lunch and recess so our teachers could do stuff, or have complete thoughts, but my kids schools the teachers take them out to recess. So they have specials time and lunch. And I know my daughter's teacher has been helping her with her math at lunch this week.", "She didn't \"outright lie\" for fucks sake. She probably said \"he rescheduled, I have this day off, can you cover it?\" Because that was the pertinent information. That's how professionals speak to their bosses.\n\nAs for the not eating--tsschers don't get time to feed themselves. There are extremely rigid schedules and if they miss the the 20 minute window to eat, *there is no other time to eat*.", "that was what pushed me to agree YTA- teacher being late (25 min) with no communication is bad, but his response was AH behaviour. the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. \n\nit did sound like he was given a time to be at the meeting and didn\u2019t have a choice in when that would be, but he could have let her know before hand that he had to leave at 5 to get home for his meeting so this wouldn\u2019t have been a problem.", "They both were scheduled at the same time. He fulfilled his responsibility. She didn't. You're nitpicking because you have nothing else.\n\nAny other workplace, if you're working on something at your desk or whatever but there's a meeting at 3 PM, you are expected to stop working at 2:58 and make your way to the meeting room. If you're on a call, you wind it down and a couple of minutes won't kill anyone. But over 20 minutes late? Unacceptable and you would rightly be called on it. Or the job interview horror stories of people being kept waiting that we can see all over Reddit.\n\nEspecially if you then breezed in and informed the other person \"oh I'm just working on something, I'll be with you in a few minutes\". No. Just no.", "Or if she has special Ed students in her class she probably met  with their parents in the special Ed teachers classroom and our conferences take awhile because our kids have multiple teachers and there's a lot of legal shit involved (like if we want to change something we can't do it there we have to schedule a formal IEP meeting).\n\nSo yes she could have been in a conference!", "Because he thinks he is god and everyone sound worship him and his seedling as perfect human beings.", "Mine got scheduled at an inconvenient time, I emailed her and rescheduled it, it took 10 seconds of my time. She was more than happy to make it work for everyone.  OP just like, didn't?", "OP admitted himself in another comment that his meeting went over time. He\u2019s fucking telling on himself here.", "Yes, I can only imagine how graceful OP would have been if she'd taken out her phone during his conference to check her emails and wrote to other parents about appointment times. \n\nSurely he, and you, would have praised her professionalism to the heavens!! \n\nYet, that's what she was supposed to do to other parents to accommodate him.", "It\u2019s a different scenario, a way different one. You don\u2019t make doctors appointments when you have other things to do plus you except to wait for awhile. Most places will tell you if your doctor is running behind. It does suck through, I waited for over two hours for the stupid eye doctor once because they prioritize walk-ins, specifically elderly walk-ins.", "Don't get me wrong, he's a fast worker. Just very chatty and has unmedicated ADHD, loses track of time very very easily. This also means he's often late in the morning. Feels like we're trying to manage a child all day sometimes trying to keep him on schedule", "Yes I go to multiple doctors throughout the year. I will say, I sat in a room waiting an entire hour for my new doctor to come see me. I saw her in the hallway in her office that entire hour before she saw me. Now that was an AH move on her part because she just looked like she was doing paperwork. But usually there are other patients that might go over there time or doctors get called away for something that might be a bit more important", "And I made that in year 1 of a much less valuable and easier job", "\"excuse me, I see we're running over and I need to quickly send an email to the next parents.\"", "This is what we do. All of our conferences take place in the gyms. You can see that your kid's teacher might be over time and it's nbd. The giant clock on the wall is also handy for keeping things on schedule. \n\nWe do a hybrid in-person/on-line conference schedule, and the online ones cut off at 10 minutes with no way to extend.", "She's probably never had someone be a dick about it before because most people are reasonable and know conferences go over", "That\u2019s very possible.  My sons teacher started her meetings at like 2:00pm (they did some 504 and IEP meetings) and those were scheduled by admin and then she had her parent teacher conferences.   A 504 meeting was running late which sent the other meetings about 10 minutes behind and then we had a lot to discuss regarding my son because his father had passed away a few months before that, he was in therapy, he was struggling and hated school.  So our meeting which started 10 minutes late, ran maybe 5-10 minutes over time (she also had the school counselor in on the meeting).  And she wouldn\u2019t be able to really tell another parent anything other than she was running late on other meetings.   I don\u2019t even like my sons teachers, but I work as a substitute and I know how hard it is to get everything done, plus lesson planning and cleaning and the other half a million tasks.", "Really? If your dr was running 20-25 minutes behind schedule they would tell you? Mine have always had be wait 10-15 mins and then go back to the room and wait some more\u2026", "Bahahhahaha, yeah I wish. I get emails and calls up to midnight. Can't ignore as I am the counsellor. If something goes sideways, I may be their only solace. But yeah most days peeing is beyond a privilege and eating.. What is that?", "[40% of Seattle's teachers make $100,000 plus](https://www.thecentersquare.com/washington/40-of-seattles-teachers-make-100-000-plus-still-want-respectful-pay/article_09c8b9c4-fefe-11ec-b441-4bd0239ba0e3.html)", "[40% of Seattle's teachers make $100,000 plus](https://www.thecentersquare.com/washington/40-of-seattles-teachers-make-100-000-plus-still-want-respectful-pay/article_09c8b9c4-fefe-11ec-b441-4bd0239ba0e3.html)", "Yeah, it\u2019s only when they\u2019re really backed up I think. And then there\u2019s the let us know if you been waiting for more then 15 minutes.", "That's awful. \n\nI can still remember my school counselor in elementary school. She had a huge impact on my life, and is probably a pretty big part of why I am a functioning human adult today. \n\nThe work you do is important, but you know that. You guys deserve better.", "We all do, but imagine if you go into your dentist's office at 8:55 for a 9 am appointment and there's no one there, no dentist no receptionist, so you just send him a text or two (no response), and wait around hoping that you'll be able to get this done and make it to work on time. 25 minutes later he shows up and asks you to wait for longer? Nah I'd tell the dentist \"do you\" and find a new one. There's no place for such behaviour in a professional environment, no matter the circumstances (exceptions being actual emergencies ofc)."]}
