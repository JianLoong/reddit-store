No reply, no text (she obviously has mine). 10 minutes later I send another email saying that I can't wait any longer and we'd have to reschedule. I was very annoyed.\n\nAs I am walking down the hallway, I see her and she says she just needs a few minutes in her classroom to prep. I said no worries. We'll reschedule. I got shit to do and had a small window to do this meeting.\n\nShe said it wouldn't take long. I said no.

I told her welcome to my day but at least I show up on time and left.\n\nApparently she tried to have the VP do the conference with me today. He came at me sideways about rescheduling at the last minute so I checked him and said that his teacher shouldn't had shown up 25 minutes late. Plus he doesn't know squat about my son.\n\nYes Mrs O left that part out. And I attached the emails I sent to her asking where she was. \n\nAll of a sudden,  Mrs O emailed me to say we can do the conference today. I came and obviously it was nothing about how sweet, cute, funny and smart my boy is. \n\nAt the end, she said that I really upset her for not working with her last night. As a result, she had to come in on a day that she was trying to take off and caused problems between bet and her VP. \n\nI told her that's right. It's her problem.

However, how she conducted the meeting was completely unprofessional and inappropriate, and it should be followed up on.\n\nETA: If I understood what OP said at the bottom, it has already affected the child as she did not have positive things to say about the kid. I'm not saying that OP doesn't have a bias on how great his kid is, but the incident does seem to have colored the teacher's vision of the child. This definitely be reported. This woman needs help!", "Wait, why shouldn't her boss know their employees' behavior if OP deems that behavior inappropriate? It may prevent it from happening to someone else.", "It\u2019s not about resources. It\u2019s about professionalism. Teachers complain that people don\u2019t treat them like professionals. That means they need to act like professionals. That means acting appropriately and being accountable.", "Would bet large sum this is a high cost of living area and that, relatively, 75k is on the lower end of what most people living there make per year.", "Let\u2019s put that 6k in perspective for the people standing in the back.  You are correct in your assessment that they are still underpaid.  That\u2019s not the salary of a young teacher.  Depending on the state, that could be the total salary of a teacher who has probably been teaching 16+ years and has been required to get a masters degree (with the accompanying student loans) in order to keep their certification.  Once you hit the top of the pay scale, all you get is COLA increases.  There are no raises unless they are bargained.  Even the raises barely make a dent.\n\nAlso, if we assume almost 30% of that money is hacked off for taxes, it\u2019s not that much take home pay for a hell of a lot of work.  I worked 12-16 hour days for that pay.  No overtime.\n\nAs for the \u201cgenerous\u201d pension, I\u2019m the poster child to show how much this has changed.  I started teaching in 1987 in OR with a Tier 1 retirement.  I taught 15 years and moved to WA, Tier 3.  After 25 years, I moved back to OR and added 2.5 more years to that retirement account.  I quit teaching in 2021 (not retired\u2014I quit).  There were a couple years in there where I took a break to earn my masters degree.\n\nRecap:  17.5 years in OR in Tier 1.  15 years in WA in Tier 3.\n\nMy monthly retirement income from OR will be almost 4x than my income from WA (when I do start drawing retirement).  Neither is enough to cover living expenses on their own. If I combine OR with SS it would be enough for me if I were single (DH has a poor retirement savings due to a number of factors, some of which were out of his control). I taught close to the same number of years in each state (15 v. 17.5), but that\u2019s how bad the retirement pension is in WA\u2014one of the better paying states, mind you. The younger teachers in OR now have the same kind of pension plan as WA, so everyone who started teaching in the 90\u2019s won\u2019t have enough retirement income after 30-40 years of teaching.  They will need SS and at least one supplementary retirement plan to just pay monthly expenses.\n\nSo\u2026..I taught for 32.5 years and my top salary when I retired was $74,600.  I have a Bachelors, a Masters, and an additional 322 graduate level course credits beyond the masters degree.  Name a profession with that much experience and education, working 60+ hours a week, that earns that low of a salary and I\u2019ll argue that that person is way underpaid for their expertise.\n\nNo whining, just facts.  A friend of mine with 40 years in education is making more as a math tutor than she did as a public school teacher.  That\u2019s an exceptionally talented teacher who is not in a classroom.  If folks want to antagonize teachers to the point that they quit their jobs, they\u2019d better be ready for the consequences that will follow.", "Where did it say that?", "Yeah she chose to be a teacher, and thank god because the teacher shortage is so bad you no longer even need a degree in some states. You don't know that she chose the meeting time, these conferences are mandatory, and it sounds like the schedule was generated by the school.\n\nShe was in conferences with other parents, how tf could she have time to reply to his emails?\n\nShe probably left out the fact she was late because she STILL SHOWED UP WITHIN THE TIMEFRAME and it's expected that a lot of parents will cause previous conferences to go long because they can't shut up about their precious angels.\n\nMeanwhile, OP has the audacity to act like his day is always as bad as what the teacher is going through??

Instead you decide to be a jerk.\n\nEdit 2: After reading your comments. I just shake my head. Do you intentionally look for an excuse to belittle other people. To be a jerk etc.\n\nEdit 3: With you saying \"She should be thankful I'm a dad who takes these meetings seriously\" All I see is someone who is completely miserable.\n\nEdit 4: Your time isn't more valuable than hers. You are nothing but entitled.", "Good adults can handle their emotions\u2026\u2026like adults", "If what OP said is true, yes the teacher made a mistake with the schedule and she should have owned it to the vp and offered a simple apology to OP. NTA for having her come in on the day off.\n\nThat being said, OP's attitude makes me doubt that this is how this played out. And it reminds me of why I left teaching. I loved my students but 30k a year (Fl public school) was not enough to continue dealing with that type of bs. Changed to healthcare, the bs to pay ratio is much better. OP, I hope this teacher has done something positive for your son and that he's learning a lot from her. If she's doing that part of her job well, put this in perspective and give a little grace. Our country's children are the ones paying the price for the burnout, we're running out of qualified people who can handle high stress and low pay. You might end up being the back-breaking straw and you shouldn't be proud of that.", "> That's pretty good money for \"babysitting.\"\n\nIt's actually terrible.  \n\nIn my state, childcare averages $13/hour.  So most teachers have about 10 kids per class.  So teachers SHOULD be making...let me check...$130/hour for JUST 10 months of work.  That doesn't count after school activities, clubsponsorships, additional required certifications/professional development.", "I make more than her as a teacher because I work in a HCOL area and I can tell you I take home far less than $6K a month which combined with the HCOL barely scraps me by even without a family. \n\nIt's not babysitting. You're just an AH.\n\nThe whole setup of these conferences seems bizarre and it sounds like she was very dismissive of your time needs. But something similar to this happened to my sister this year when she showed up for her parent teacher conference. As she walked in she was told by an administrator that they forgot to call her and let her know the teacher was out and has to postpone. Come to find out the teacher was rushing her son to the hospital. Life happens to everyone. It was a bad day for you, and probably a bad day for her too. Point being, people usually deserve the benefit of the doubt.", "He said he only hired sitter cause he had to go meeting with teacher. so if no meeting with teacher he implies he would do swim and meeting himself.

To MOST people (especially non-teachers) annual means \"across 12 months\", so OP averaged it per month.  Most non-teachers don't think of a \"year\" or \"annual\" in terms of 10 months.  I'd be surprised if even most teachers did these days.  \n\nNot only that, but look at how OP stated it.  He said \"75k, which is over 6k per month\" not \"over 6k per month which is 75k.\"  \n\nSource: Teacher who is paid 12 times per year."]}
