No reply, no text (she obviously has mine). 10 minutes later I send another email saying that I can't wait any longer and we'd have to reschedule. I was very annoyed.\n\nAs I am walking down the hallway, I see her and she says she just needs a few minutes in her classroom to prep. I said no worries. We'll reschedule. I got shit to do and had a small window to do this meeting.\n\nShe said it wouldn't take long. I said no.

I told her welcome to my day but at least I show up on time and left.\n\nApparently she tried to have the VP do the conference with me today. He came at me sideways about rescheduling at the last minute so I checked him and said that his teacher shouldn't had shown up 25 minutes late. Plus he doesn't know squat about my son.\n\nYes Mrs O left that part out.

As a result, she had to come in on a day that she was trying to take off and caused problems between bet and her VP. \n\nI told her that's right. It's her problem.

An outside of school hours meeting should be a commitment, not optional. You're both on a schedule, I find it very unprofessional how the teacher handled the situation. A quick email would have sufficed, the least she could've done is apologized for leaving you there without an answer and agreed to re-schedule in the first place.", "NTA, she scheduled the time then didn't show up. Don't schedule it if you can't make it. Then try to blame you when it's her own fault? No not happening. You did the right thing and her trying to blame her incompetence on you is astounding.", "So she was late she disrespected your time and lied about it to her boss. NTA and she should consider herself lucky you're not making a formal complaint about her behaviour.", "NTA\n\nLook, we all  know that teachers are underpaid, overworked and put up with a lot from parents, kids and administration.  So, yes grace is a good thing. \n\nHowever, the bottom line is you squeezed it into a day that was already very full and waited 25 minutes for her and then she wasn't truthful with her boss about it.  The stuff about thanking you for showing up though does sound a little douchey- but in the end, you're not NTA", "NTA.. She was late and didn't give you a heads up before hand. She did nothing but give excuses and leave out facts to her VP regarding why the meeting was rescheduled and then blames you for getting in trouble.", "If I'm not mistaken, it sounds like you waited 25 minutes after the scheduled meeting time, one that you had no say in picking. From what you said, you were not mean or nasty about rescheduling.  \nShe didn't give you the courtesy to let you know she was running late, didn't apologize for being late, and got upset about having to reschedule.  \nTeachers are overworked, but that doesn't excuse them from practicing common courtesy.\n\nAs an aside though, you come off as a little snarky, which is understandable given your frustration. However, this is a person who is spending a lot of time with your child - a little grace and understanding to public servants will go a long way.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I think expecting someone to respect your time while simultaneously not respecting your time is ridiculous. I know teachers have it hard right now, their jobs aren\u2019t respected nearly enough, but in this case the teacher is definitely the ah here", "NTA.

Everyone has had a bad day and everyone has run late before. It's fine that you couldn't wait and it's fine that you had to reschedule and she absolutely should have apologized and dealt with the consequences of her schedule.

She ask VP to meet with you as it is her day off or a day she wants off.  Fails to tell VP it was her that didn't show for the meeting.  \n\nNo, her time management is in need of some work.

And once she was there, you could have just done the conference and gotten it over with.  Or do a video conference.  Really, there were other options, but you'd rather bring her in on her day off.

Then she complained about having to come in next day, to do the job she couldn't do today.

Some kids are difficult and you need time to communicate that gently. Some parents are even more difficult and take more time than planned. Some parents show up late. Some parents have more than one kid in the school and if one teacher runs late, it impacts the others. We don't have time to answer emails during that time, we just try and go through parents as fast as possible while doing our job communicating correctly.  \n\n\n>I told her welcome to my day but at least I show up on time and left.\n\nYou're rude.\n\n>I came and obviously it was nothing about how sweet, cute, funny and smart my boy is.\n\nSo if you had waited, that could have been done in 4 minutes instead of rescheduling.  \n\n\n>She should thank me that I'm a dad who takes these conferences seriously and shows up.\n\nNobody and I do mean, abso-f\\*\\*\\*-inlutely nobody, is ever going to thank you for doing the very bare minimum about your son's scolarity.\n\nIf you had been unable to stay due to another commitment, I would have said otherwise but based on your comment and your general attitude YTA.\n\nWould you speak like that to a doctor  running 25 minutes late on his schedule? Probably not. The point here is not that she was late, it's that you don't respect the woman who spends her days taking care and educating your son.", "NTA regarding the question. Very much an AH for expecting *thanks* for doing your job as a parent.", "YTA, and an entitled one at that!!! The world does not revolve around you and your child. That teacher has at least, if not more, 20 + other students and parents to accommodate. That teacher has a life outside of the classroom; and you forced her to come in on her day off. Maybe she had medical appointments, or her own family to attend to. Even though it had been a bad day, the instructor tried to accommodate you; and you were unsympathetic. You went over her head to the admin; which will add more stress. Your child could have skipped swimming lessons for one day; so that you could have been on time to the original appointment. Perhaps you should volunteer in a classroom for at least two weeks in order to gain a valuable lesson in compassion and empathy.", "YTA. You're why teachers quit.\n\nCare more about your kid's education than your pocketbook. What if she had a lot to talk about that went over your precious clock?  Why are you scheduling this into tight windows? Why are you under the impression that she works for you? She should thank you for showing up? You should thank her for giving enough of a crap to reschedule with someone who thinks so little of her.", "I'm going to go against the grain here, and say YTA.

The parents scheduled the time, not the school or the teacher.\n\nOP has every right to be pissed for showing up at the scheduled time and the teacher doesn't show up and then doesn't respond to OP's communications.\n\nOP is NTA.
