No reply, no text (she obviously has mine). 10 minutes later I send another email saying that I can't wait any longer and we'd have to reschedule. I was very annoyed.\n\nAs I am walking down the hallway, I see her and she says she just needs a few minutes in her classroom to prep. I said no worries. We'll reschedule. I got shit to do and had a small window to do this meeting.\n\nShe said it wouldn't take long. I said no.

I told her welcome to my day but at least I show up on time and left.\n\nApparently she tried to have the VP do the conference with me today. He came at me sideways about rescheduling at the last minute so I checked him and said that his teacher shouldn't had shown up 25 minutes late. Plus he doesn't know squat about my son.\n\nYes Mrs O left that part out.

I came and obviously it was nothing about how sweet, cute, funny and smart my boy is. \n\nAt the end, she said that I really upset her for not working with her last night. As a result, she had to come in on a day that she was trying to take off and caused problems between bet and her VP. \n\nI told her that's right. It's her problem.

What likely happened was another asshole parent would not stop talking about their kid which ate into OP\u2019s time. The teacher can\u2019t just pull out their phone to text or email you in the middle of an interview.\n\nOP could have requested a reschedule to a day where the teacher *actually*  is scheduled to be working. Why does it have to be their day off? Teachers often work 7 days a week as it is, and savour time that is specifically scheduled off.\n\nYou could have been nicer, there is a million reasons why being empathetic and kind and giving her the benefit of the doubt would have been a way better response.", "YTA\nMainly because you sound arrogant as all f***. Have you ever had a bad day? Have you ever run late? Sometimes, compassion for another human is all you need to have. Of course, there are only certain days that conferences are available, as a parent, you work around them because it is in the best interest of your child. FYI, skipping a swim lesson is not that big of a deal. I am a parent and pay for all sorts of lessons, and for me, education is much more important than extracurricular activities.", "YTA\n\nJust by reading your comments I know you are leaving info out to paint her in a bad light.\n\nEDIT: Spelling", "ESH\n\nHer for not letting you know she was running late and you for just being a dick in general.", "ESH, teacher should have communicated but you suck and I pray for the teachers that have to deal with you", "NTA.", "NTA and I love your style!! \n\nI am so done with \"rules for thee but not for me.\" \n\nRespect for each others time is paramount and all she had to do was not be an entitled B and it would have all gone differently.", "NTA", "YTA-you could have easily emailed the teacher \u201c430 does not work for me, thanks\u201d", "ESH.

Imagine if your boss ripped you a new asshole the next day for missing a meeting and over $60, which is probably not an hours pay for you?\n\nBecause that is pretty much what you did to that teacher. I am a scientist, and my good friend is a science teacher and we have similar years of experience (30 years). I wouldn't get out of BED for what he gets paid and the shitty parents, kids, school board and voters he gets to deal with. He does it because he loves it. Not because he deserves to get pay rated the lowest in the whole state and there's literally a law barring teachers from striking for better pay (essential workers).\n\nSo yes, YOU SUCK TOO.", "NTA at all.

You did a normal and expected parenting thing. Fine. No special cookie for that. \n\nOffering grace is free. You don\u2019t have to be a doormat - insisting on a reschedule is appropriate.

It still is underpaid especially when dealing with entitled parents\u2026YTA", "YTA...  you sound miserable.  \"She should thank me that I'm a dad who takes these conferences seriously and shows up.\" that's the least you can do as a parent.", "Your boy had swim at 4 but you had meeting at 5.15. So how where you going to do that and complete a meeting?\n\nTeacher was late that was wrong and you should be angry about wasted time.\n\nMost teachers do multiple parent talks on same day so should be at school but you make it sound like you were only one that day and they never turned up?\n\nYou spoke to teacher and it wasnt about how cute and lovely your child was? Teacher parent talk is about their education and how they making progress, isnt that what you expected? \n\nI understand the wasted time and that was wrong i just dont understand the rest!", "YTA\n\nThere are other parents in the world besides you. It's common for other parents to go beyond their conference time and throw everyone else's appointments off schedule, similar to what happens in doctor's offices. Next time, book the earliest conference time available and that will be far less likely to happen. \n\nSure she should've apologized, but she doesn't owe you an explanation. In fact, giving you an explanation would likely violate the privacy of the other students and parents. Education is a field where parents aren't supposed to be privy to the details of other parents and their children and can even be illegal in certain circumstances. \n\nAlso, she's probably not checking her email while she's conferencing with other parents. That would be rude and unprofessional, and I know that you would be pissed if she had gotten her phone out to check emails while conferencing with you.\n\nWhere are you getting that she makes 6k a month? I live in a state where teachers are lucky to make 35k a year and max out at around 45k if they have decades of experience and advanced degrees.\n\nFinally, \"I came and obviously it was nothing about how sweet, cute, funny and smart my boy is,\" is the dumbest thing you've said in your post. The point of a parent-teacher conference is not to make chit-chat about how awesome your kid is. The point is to discuss his academic progress, strengths and weaknesses, and how to support your son academically. If you want your child to be doted on then consider taking him to see his grandmother. \" She should thank me that I'm a dad who takes these conferences seriously and shows up.\" And THAT is the second dumbest thing in your post. You don't get a gold star for being a basic parent, regardless of your gender. Do you also want a medal for feeding your child too? You sound like one of those people that thinks that since you're a man that you should be heaped with praise for changing a diaper since that's \"women's work.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust admit that you hate teachers and you think that your time is more important that everyone else's.

Not to mention all the asshole parents who think their child can do no wrong when they're probably the worst in class and they take out their frustration on the teacher.\n\nAlso, im guessing OP has never gone to a doctor's office of any kind because I've waited longer than 25 minutes past a scheduled appointment a billion times.

OP never said she apologized for being late or lying to the VP about him.", "Disagree. She fucked up, but there is no reason to be petty and make her life worse.

It seems weird that they know some parents don't/can't show up and don't plan ahead to make sure they can reschedule them. Mom was single and worked so they usually planned our conferences around her work day. And sometimes we just meet after school that same week or once on a teacher work day/records day. I mean she was late so it's really her fault but if you knew that time didn't really work for you I don't know why you didn't say something in the first place.
