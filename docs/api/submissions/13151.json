Your cousin isn\u2019t your child so if you, for whatever reason, don\u2019t want to watch her, it\u2019s totally fine and your aunt needs to find someone else.", "NTA. She is fine for asking, but her reaction to your no and not respecting your answer makes her an asshole. She deciced to get a kid, it is her responsibility to find someone to take care for her kid if she wants to go somewhere. You're absolutely within your right to say no if you don't have the time or energy for that!", "NTA. How did your aunt know that you weren't working? Sounds like she heard you had a day off and realised she could save money by using you instead of a babysitter.\n\nEveryone needs time off. She's got time off, she's meeting her friends for dinner. Why doesn't she extend that courtesy to you?\n\nShe's got no respect for you. You've got no obligation to look after her child because she wants to relax.", "NTA\n\nAnd if you did agree to baby's, you should only agree if you're going to get paid.\n\nIt might be a good idea to spend your day of relaxation away from your home so your aunt can't dump your cousin on you and run.", "NTA, you\u2019re not obligated to care for your cousin unless you made a commitment to do so before then. If not, then it\u2019s not on you. Studying is hard and stressful, but important. And work is the same. You need to be able to take those breaks when needed so you don\u2019t burn out.", "NTA.  Nobody is entitled to your time, and you are definitely not a free babysitter at your aunts convenience.", "You're NTA. Funny how your aunt feels entitled to time off but doesn't think you deserve the same. Even worse, she believes that you should have to take care of her responsibility so she can have that break.", "NTA in my opinion. You are not obligated  to care for your aunts child. She is. She\u2019s just mad she can\u2019t take advantage of free (or low cost?) childcare. Emotional manipulation on her part is not cool. Not your problem or fault she didn\u2019t plan farther ahead for childcare. Having a child means being in charge of them all the time, even when you have plans. And acting like her nephew has the same sort of responsibility she is selfish on her side. Go have your relaxation day in peace my dude.", "NTA Annnd that\u2019s why we don\u2019t announce to people when we are having a free day. Because people think you need to be occupied. Since you have *all that free time!, here ya go*- watch your cousin.  Ugh.", "No of course you\u2019re NTA. Your cousin is not your responsibility. Any offer to babysit your cousin is a favor and courtesy on your part, not an expectation. \n\nDon\u2019t let your aunt take advantage of you.", "Nta. You need a day for yourself to relax. She should find other baby sitters for your cousin.", "\u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for it, either. If you don\u2019t take care of yourself, you can\u2019t take care of others.\n\nAnd next time just apologize and say you can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t need a reason. Your old enough to make your own decisions.\n(NTA)", "NTA. Some parents are so absurd. That's not your kid, you aren't required to watch him and she isn't entitled to dump her brat on you whenever she wants to have a girls day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So enjoy it and forget about your aunt.", ">She blows up on me saying that I should spend more time with my cousin, even tho we see each other at least 2 times a week to play Pok\u00e9mon Go together.\n\nThat's plenty of time to spend with a cousin.  She's mad you won't watch your cousin and is trying to guilt you into changing your mind. Stay strong.  You deserve time off. NTA!", "NTA. Not even a little. Your free time sounds like it is far & few between. You have every right to take time for yourself. Aunt sounds awfully entitled to your time. Especially her remark of how handy it'd be to watch your cousin. Yeah sure. It's handy for her. You? Not so much.", "Nta. But, for your relaxing day. You're may want to leave the home incase you get a drop in and magically your little cousin is there.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHer asking is fine, her pushing when you said no is not.", "Yeah, I mentioned it to my uncle, because he needed me to get something from my nearby supermarket, so I said I'd get it for him quickly on my day off", "NTA. You are allowed to say no. Not your kid, not your responsibility. In the future, just tell them you have doctor appointments, yes, plural. They don\u2019t need to know it\u2019s a mental health day.", "Why don't more people understand that their children are their own responsibility, and that no one else is obligated to provide childcare if they don't want to?\n\nNTA", "Unfortunately, this is very true. OPs aunt sounds entitled and seems to like the kind of person to do this.", "Your problem was explaining yourself. The error here is it implies you're open to it if not for x. Next time just say no and do not go beyond that.", "NTA - an individual's free time is NOT for others to allot. \n\nIf it's one thing people have in spades OP, it's the *fucking audacity*. Enjoy your day off.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your responsibility. If her dinner with friends was that important she\u2019d have thought ahead.", "NTA. Now you know never to JADE with her. No is a complete sentence however you want to dress it up.", "You learnt not to open your mouth anymore now lol", "You took the day off for yourself, not for your aunt.\n\nIf you didn't use the day off for what you actually took it off for, you could just as well go to work and save your day off for another time.\n\nYour aunt sounds awfully entitled, wanting to organize your time for her benefit just because your presence is handy while she's lunching with friends....\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you need to leave the house early on your off day or maybe even the evening before just in case your aunt decides to drop your cousin off and leave before you can stop her.", "\u201cSorry, can\u2019t, I have plans.\u201d \nAunt doesn\u2019t need to know that the plans are to chill out. \nNTA.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYour aunt just wanted a free babysitter.
