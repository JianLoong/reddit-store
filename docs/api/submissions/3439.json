I went through the same thing as a teen. Even as an adult, when life throws bad curveballs, I still sometimes wet the bed. Its noting to be ashamed of.

Maybe it would be worth it, not for spending money for this sort of thing, but for spending money for anything you need when you can't rely on your unsupportive parents.

But you could probably find at least some resources on your own that might help. In the meantime, consider saving your pocket money for a cheaper waterproof blanket. Or in the short term consider using a waterproof table cloth and some towels on top of that and put that over your bottom fitted sheet to protect the mattress and reduce the stress of laundry. Drink lots of water early in the day and then stop drinking water after dinner and pee right before you go to bed.

Try investing in some reusable incontinence/period underwear like Speax, Thinx, or ONDRwear. I'd go for Speax or Thinx, ONDRwear doesn't have as much coverage. They look exactly like regular underwear (some are pretty cute) & you can run them in the washer & hang dry. I can have a pretty heavy period overnight, and my Thinx has never leaked, I love them. Speax is made by the same company.\n\nIf you need to get money from your parents up front, you could spin it like this: the underwear can be used as period underwear too. So they won't have to pay for your pads/tampons (assuming they currently do so).  \n\nThe site is [thinx.com](https://thinx.com) and they have an online customer support team you can chat with about ordering the right product. They're also running a 50% off sale till 12am PST today. They're a chill company, I've talked with their sales reps about possibly carrying the line in the shop I work in.

I'm rooting for you.", "What I'm saying if they parents won't help then op needs to help themselves. It sucks, but sometimes kids are dealt shit hands in life. What you do with that hand is up to you. Ops parents won't, so op needs to help themselves. That could be finding local resources or getting a job. But not doing anything is going to keep them in the same spot. And as their parents have shown they won't help, it would be wise to get a job to start saving to get themselves into a better situation.", "Okay but she can't force them so either get a job or keep changing sheets.

I only live in a small city so I guess I won't find anything outside the internet. \n\nI have been to several doctors and they all say it's stress related and that I'm physiclly completly fine.

And to be super clear, mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression should be addressed and treated just like physical illness.  \n\n\nThe bed wetting is a symptom.

You are 16 years old and it\u2019s your parents responsibility to provide those types of medically related supplies for you.

My advice to you would be if you have any other trusted adults in your life, confide in them the situation and ask for help. If you don\u2019t have anyone to ask, then I would go the route of speaking to your school guidance, counselor, or speaking to the school nurse. Also, not sure if you are in therapy or not but I would definitely recommend it to help with the stress based bedwetting. I think it would be really helpful for you to be able to talk with someone that could give you some good coping strategies to deal with your stress and anxiety. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in the situation and wishing you the best.", "NTA These are a medical need, same as pads. Your parents are obligated to pay for them. However, I would get a job because if your step-dad and mom do not support you, it is very possible they will kick you out once you are 18. You need some money in case that happens. Anywho, I would sleep without the the diapers for a few nights after you run out, but sleep on the couch because you don't want to mess up your bed.

I highly encourage you to find a local LGBTQ+ support group if you can, or seek support from Reddit's many LGBTQ communities (but careful cause it's still Reddit).\n\nYour mom's lack of understanding and compassion is very concerning.\n\nThat all said, getting a job to afford not just your own hygiene supplies but saving up to move out sounds like a good thing.
