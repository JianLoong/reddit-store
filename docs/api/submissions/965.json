Anyone saying otherwise is the real AH. In fact, anyone ignoring it to keep the peace is being an AH for exposing the baby", "The fact that he actually chose moving over throwing trash away then used the grand child as a threat over it is all incredibly ridiculous. Your son needs to feel the struggle of life for a bit so he can realize what a jerk he's being. Let him move and see what happens.", "Listen that is disgusting. I am actually wondering if they look after the baby or neglecting it. 20 dirty diapers.... If I was you I would call CPS. A child can't grow up with parents who would rather move out than throw away trash. It is not save for your granddaughter. Both your son and daughter in law are clearly to immature to parent", "Husband NTA, you AH for not supporting your husband. Your son most defo AH for living like a pig in someone else's house. Old enough to have a kid, old enough to clean up after himself and said spawn. Old enough to follow the house rules of someone else's house...and he's an AH for using your gandbaby against you both.", "Your son is an AH, for several reasons, to include the dirty diapers piling up, freeloading, actually choosing to move out over this instead of cleaning the diapers, and most of all using the granddaughter as a pawn in his silly game/inability to keep emotions in check.  The emotional immaturity of him is astounding!  You would be the AH if you saw the diapers piling up, your husband asked you to help him say something, and you continued to walk through them while ignoring them.", "NTA. That just sounds neglectful.", "Info: Are your son, the baby momma, and the baby all doing okay? For two adults to ignore a pile 20 dirty diapers in their bedroom is a very bad sign. Is the baby clean and fed?", "NTA that\u2019s disgusting and also probably not healthy for anyone let alone a baby to be living in a room with fecal matter floating around in the air. Does your son and his gf not know how to use a garbage bin? Do they clean up other areas in the house or just leave a mess wherever they go? Your husband is probably incredibly frustrated. My guess is you\u2019ll be hearing from your son soon because there\u2019s probably a reason why they\u2019re living with you and not in a place of their own so it might be smart to discuss boundaries and stipulations with your husband IF you are going to let them move back in.", "The only AH in this scenario is your son. He has used your home as his own, with his own family in tow. They\u2019re sponging off you. Allowing any dirty diapers to pile up is very dirty. They\u2019ll attract pests. Threatening to cut you out of your grandchild\u2019s life just to punish you is emotionally abusive.\n\nI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be back, where else will they go for free?\n\nNTA", "Info? Is your husband mad at you because you didn't back him up? Did you do anything one way or the other? Were there other issues with your son?", "Nta, son is old enough to have a baby he is old enough to take care of the mess that comes with one.", "NTA - If you didn't step in, at some point you had to have agreed with your husband, and you're here to see if it was okay to side with him. Yes it was. the health hazards of having that amount of soiled diapers is ridiculous, and I imagine there was already tension leading up this point.\n\nYour son is 23, has a baby, and \"baby-momma\" It's time they get hit with the reality of adulthood.", "NTA. Man was putting your health first, the child was not.  By child, I mean your son.", "With all due respect...if your son is ok leaving 20+ shit stained diapers in his room, then he is not mature enough to make it on his own with a child\n\nHe'll be back\n\nJust give it time\n\nNTA", "Yes you're an asshole for not backing your husband. In fact you should have had cps called on you for having a grandchild live in filth and also your son needs to learn the real struggle out in the real world. You are telling him to use grandchild as leverage to get whatever he wants. You have created a monster that will live with you till you die. YTA.", "YTA for allowing your grandchild to live in those conditions", "NTA at all. 20 plus dirty diapers in a room sounds like a health hazard.  Son needs to move out for just that alone.", "NTA. You don't say whether you agree with your husband or not, but 20 dirty diapers piled in a room is disgusting. Perhaps you could help your son out by gifting him a diaper pail.", "INFO: 20 diapers didn't pile up overnight. Even with a newborn they don't go that often. Why didn't you notice the diapers sooner? This smells fishy", "NTA. Life can only improve when someone who creates a bio-hazard moves out. How disgusting to live with the smell of dirty diapers and too lazy to take them out to the trash.", "INFO: I'm confused about what actions you actually took here. You say you didn't step up and agree with your husband. Does that mean that you think he should have ignored the diapers? Did you tell your son he didn't have to move out? Do you actually agree with your husband and just stay quiet?\n\nI think your husband was well within his rights to make this ultimatum. It is a simple and reasonable thing to ask of your son. Letting dirty diapers pile up in a room where an infant is living is unhygienic and bordering on abuse. Why would you want her to live in that environment?", "So you\u2019re enabling your loser of a son? He and his baby momma are disgusting and so are you for not supporting your husband.  YTA", "YTA. That\u2019s nasty. Do you think that\u2019s any way for your granddaughter to live? You should have agreed with your husband. If your son is a hot head you should have let him do what he needed to do, and speak to him when he was calmer. Your son is clearly the problem. You need to stand up for your husband because it\u2019s not just your home, it\u2019s also his. NOT your son and his baby mommas.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's emotional blackmail. Your husband was correct . When your son gets his own place son can wallpaper the house in dirty diapers if he wants.
