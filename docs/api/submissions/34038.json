In any culture, someone who keeps changing the arrival time yet still expects a meal at 11pm is deluded. If you say you are going to be somewhere for dinner at 9 pm, be there.", "NTA as a chronically late person myself, I do not expect to be served dinner if I arrive 2 hours late for dinner, especially at 11PM.", "NTA", "NTA. Who wants guests arriving that late for dinner!?\n\n11pm I'm usually winding down and getting ready for bed!", "NTA I know it\u2019s unthinkable for Indian culture - my mom has hosted housefuls of people with 30 minutes notice while listening to \u201chelpful\u201d feedback on her impromptu cooking after an exhausting day because you can\u2019t say no to guests, and in Her case it was always in laws so you really can\u2019t say no. BUT it won\u2019t change if people don\u2019t start pushing back at even the ridiculous impositions like this situation - no one should be offended that a grown couple, not college kids, don\u2019t want to host them at 11 pm/midnight. It\u2019s got to start somewhere and hopefully if that guest\u2019s wife has someone try that with her, she\u2019ll remember this and feel more empowered to say no too!", "Ma'am, waltzing in at 11 when you already had a late dinner at 9 means you get served a cow turd on naan.  NTA.", "NTA, horribly disrespectful", "NTA. For future reference, if dinner is set at 9 p.m., and the guests calls to inform you they won't be there until TWO HOURS later, the proper response is, \"I'm sorry you can't make it to dinner this evening. Let's try again at some other date.\"\n\nImplicit in the dinner invitation is that they will be there for an evening of conversation and visiting. Not that they're going to show up to eat, then leave right after because it is late. You are not a restaurant or all-night diner open for their convenience. How horribly rude of them.", "NTA\n\nThey wanted to come at 9pm, which already seems late to me, but to delay until 11pm?  that seems quite rude to me.", "NTA.\n\n\nIf it's like 6pm and 2 hrs later 8pm. Mayyyybe if your husband likes the guests alot. But fk 11pm going 12, the food is already cold af. \n\n\nI would had called the colleague at 830 to check where are they to start setting up, if they aren't here by 10pm I would had called them saying we have something in the morning, let's meet up somewhere else for dinner instead. \n\n\nNo need for my wife to tell me. I rather eat hot food and rest early.", "NTA\n\nThey asked to show at 9pm, you said yes. They delayed. Delayed again. Then wanted to still come over for dinner at 11pm. \n\nForget it. That's just rude.\n\nNTA", "NTA. They disrespected you and your husband respectfully declined to go along with that. Well done to both of you.", "Depending on the relationship you have with your husband (we are all different), there were other choices.  I think your choice was reasonable.\n\nYou could also have told your husband you were cleaning up, and you were done in the kitchen, but if he wanted to serve and host his friends, he could; he would also be the one to clean up,  however.  This way gives him the choice of action.   It also makes him responsible for his decision.  It leaves you unblamed either way.\n\nI find when the other party has to face he will be doing the work, he makes the call on his own.  This has worked for me a few times after people realized I actually meant what I said.\n\nYou can only control you, so do that.  The rest falls on the others.  You can go to bed and get your rest, as that is your choice.  And if your husband really wanted to socialize, he still could.\n\nNTA, though, because that shit they pulled was rude.", "NTA.", "NTA. Being, say , half an hour late is tolerable. An hour, maybe. But after that it gets silly. The food will be too not at its best, you will be tired and you and your husband are not your guests' servants.\n\nHaving said that, I want to come to your place for dinner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Dinner at 11 p.m? No, no, no. NTA", "NTA. I am Indian, and a lot of us have no concept of being on time and what is respectful and not respectful when it comes to socializing in the evening.", "So true! Indians have a fetish about turning up late so much so that hosts also start prepping late. So this Indian couple who'd just arrived in Germany threw a party for the daughter's birthday. All the guests turned up on time but the hosts weren't quite ready. They were expecting Indian style unpunctuality lol.", "I so wish that my mom understood this. I was just calling my mom to say hi and told this in casual way she got angry on me. I mean as I am housewife I don't have anything else to do.\n\nI think it's okay to let mom husband be sad for some days as I also need break from them from talking.", "I agree with you, I have done this quite a few times, to accomodate each and every person's situation. My son was waiting for them to come since the moment he knew we will guests over. Moreover today everything I made taste so so good, this feels like my all hardwork got wasted.\n\nI am saving your reply as sometimes I don't have any words to say and due to being in home almost all the time I have lost my ability to respond in this kind of situations. Thank u so much!", "In Indian culture (many South Asian cultures) this is considered too rude that husband serves dinner. And they were coming with family so he needs me ..\n\nAlso he was just walking and talking around me in the kitchen while I was cleaning up, the goof up he did was I told him to say no when call came at 9:30 but he again said it's okay you all come .\n\nSo I said , I am telling you to say something to say no and you are still saying it's okay. Then when I said I am not making roti again, you make, he still waited for me to change my decision for 10 minutes. And I didn't change my decision as I felt totally unseen and u nappreciated.\n\nThen he reluctantly went to bedroom and called to say no.", "My husband, my mom who i just called to say hi after 9 pm said I should not have done that.  That made this worse. I mean no one cares, it's ok to come at 9:30, but then to come at 10:30 and eat at 11 and then I need to wind up, this will take me atleast 30 minutes. \n\nI have been guilt tripped many times, but today it was just too much.", "I am proud of you for standing up for yourself. It's easy for spouses that work to put extra responsibilities on the spouses that do not work without considering the stress that goes along with it. Hosting should be a shared responsibility, and it sounds like he was trying to push everything on you.", "Well done! I think you did the right thing, and if you continue to expect your husband to respect your words (rather than wait, hoping that it will pressure you into changing your mind from guilt) then your life will be soooo much better.", "No he helped, he arranged \u00e0nd cleaned all messages  kid created, helped clean home and he is helpful in daily chores too. \n\nCooking I am faster and way more efficient.  He never pushes anything but today he was really happy how we both did everything. My point was, it is too much for guest to come at 11 and he just wanted guest to realise what they might have missed if they didn't turn up."]}
