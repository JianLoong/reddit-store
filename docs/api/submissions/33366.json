Even if I have no idea about the particular coworker that I have been assigned, I find out more and make sure they love what they have been given. I don't break rules and stay within office prescribed price limits but it is very evident that a lot of effort goes into the gifts.\n\nHowever, this is never reciprocated to me. In the past, I have received a gift card, a Naruto plushie (I have never seen anime in my whole life), a men's wallet (I'm a very pink feminine person so Idk how...) and some items that were clearly re-gifts. This is a complete luck thing as other people receive good gifts too. It has become a running joke within my close circle that the more effort i put in, the less i receive. So this year I have turned down invitations from groups. Now everyone is guilt tripping me and calling me a spoilsport for ruining the festive mood. A few people have even approached and jokingly said how they were hoping I would be their secret santa.\n\n I could easily participate if I wanted to, but it's all a waste of time and money in my head now.

Nobody should force you to do this. \n\nNot secret santa, but a funny story about yankee swap/white elephant.

My friend was super excited because he got something that his son would really like. So happy. Comes this woman\u2019s pick, and she has the audacity to steal something that he wanted for his son.
