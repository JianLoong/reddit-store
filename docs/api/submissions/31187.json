I own the apartment and have a mortgage on it. \n\nWhen my fiance moved in, we agreed that she would pay rent of $600/month. That's far less than the market rate for a room within a flat of this quality, and probably comes out to a 40-50% discount, but I'm comfortable with that because my mortgage isn't too big, I earn good money, and I'm excited to live with her. We have a great relationship - we both have good jobs and are generous with each other. I earn more than my fiance, but probably mostly because of the age gap, and she works hard in a well-paying sector and is responsible with money otherwise. \n\nThe problem is that, whilst she paid rent on time for the first two months, her rent is now nearly three weeks late (still owes October and today is 17 November). I don't really feel like I should have to remind her at all to pay rent - I don't want to have to nag or chase her for money. She should just pay on time, as I've always done for every financial obligation I've ever had. Nonetheless, I've had to remind her three times since end-October to pay rent and she still hasn't. \n\nShe said to me (after I reminded her the third time) that \"since we're getting married, it's all the same pot anyway, and if I double pay or forget to pay one month it's not a big deal\". However, our finances haven't been combined yet, we both still work, and I know that if she 'double paid' I would know immediately and return the money. \n\nI'm now starting to feel annoyed that I'm not being listened to and worried that my partner is being too casual with what I consider to be important financial agreements that we've made to one another.\n\nWIBTA if I ream her out for this? I understand her POV that we're getting married (and I see us living happily ever after, we're truly soul mates) so I don't know if I'm just over-reacting ", "created_utc": 1700261193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xrf1v/wibta_if_i_flipped_out_on_my_fiance_for_not/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This needs FULL disclosure befor marriage", "I had a \u201cbf\u201d who needed a place to stay until he got on his feet. So I agreed he could stay in my home if he paid $100 a week and contributed to the extra costs of him living there. It didn\u2019t happen, and payment dwindled down, whilst I was working extra hours to pay to support him. He would then make comments about me putting his name on the title of the house, but that he couldn\u2019t afford to pay. But somehow managed to buy himself a classic car, which he then wanted me to clear out my belongings from the garage so his car could be parked in there, and mine on the street. That was a firm no from me, and his response was \u201cfine I\u2019ll just go rent my own place\u201d. So I said off you go then. And he was gone.\n\nYou need to set a hard line on this, whilst relationships are a partnership, it is way too early on for this to be happening. I would not even be considering marriage if she cannot respect this boundary.", "Bro run. Dont marry, dont have kids with her, and if you do make sure you have seperate funds", "NTA\n\nI'd would keep all finances separate.\n\nAnd I would insist on a prenup. \n\nOR\n\nI'd run far, far away.", "Yeet this woman out of your house like that lady yeets this raccoon. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/spPo80dPUwI?si=ig09DB3y4ZPu7pTh", "NTA \nThis is unwarranted but\u2014 please do not combine your money and if you were my brother I\u2019d tell you to slooooooow down on the marriage to her. She doesn\u2019t seem financially responsible based on this specific situation.", "Sounds more like she's found her own personal ATM rather than her 'soul mate'.", "You have every right to sit down with her and discuss it. Tell her financial obligations are important to you and you would like her to take it seriously and pay on time. \n\nThe fact you seem to want to start a fight about it is a bit concerning for the future.", "NTA, she's probably waiting to get married to leave work as well, and you'll be taking care of her", "I was thinking the same thing. Reminds me of someone getting married then one day \"Oops, I quit my job since I didn't like it. I'll stay at home now while you work and pay. You paid for it all before, so you can handle it.\" \ud83d\ude44", "It's the same pot. What's yours is ours and what's mine is mine.", "Yeah, this reads to me like she's practicing how he handles it in the future when she's the stay at home mom.\n\nOP definitely needs to have a conversation here.", "This is a great comment", "Thank you for that. Too many people think it\u2019s fine to yell and shout when frustrated. It\u2019s not healthy or useful.", "That\u2019s it. Nail, meet Head.", "Wait till she gets pregnant.", "\u201cThis is not working for me. We aren\u2019t married yet. Our money isn\u2019t combined. And I don\u2019t like feeling like I have to nag you to get you to hold up the end of the deal you agreed to. If remembering is the only issue, you can set a recurring payment to take place automatically. If something else is the issue, we need to discuss it now.\u201d", "1. Before she was paying $1000/month plus share of bills to live in a three person flat. That was a mates rates agreement with a family friend and also below market value. \n\n2. I will have to speak to her, I think she\u2019s just not prioritising paying rather than feeling like she shouldn\u2019t \n\n3. Yes perhaps", "There isn\u2019t a tenancy agreement because we\u2019ll be married in 5 months but in my country she\u2019ll receive automatic rights as a lodger (rights are bit worse than a tenant but still legally defined.\n\nI don\u2019t expect any other financial contribution like repairs etc., at least certainly not until we get married. We\u2019ve not had a convo about what happens after that. \n\nShe\u2019s not paying the \u201clions share\u201d of the mortgage, she\u2019s paying a bit under 40%. And I\u2019ve been paying off principal quite aggressively over the years with bonuses so that mortgage amount has come down a lot\n\nAny other qs ?", "This! I too have the same questions", "That\u2019s what rent is - paying someone who owns your residence so you may live there. You are never on the title or mortgage when paying rent. Given that this asset is premarital, it might not be considered community property after marriage, either.", "My brother's ex-wife did this. Worked and contributed right up until they got married and then within a couple of months of them being married she had quit her job and just spent the entirety of every day sitting on her computer playing games. Didn't do any house work or cooking or anything and then got shitty at my brother when he would go off at her for sitting on her ass all day and he comes home to a pigsty every day. She also stopped with the wifely bedroom duties too. And no she wasn't depressed. She just wanted to be a kept person roommate style.", "With someone else\u2019s baby", "This. ^^^^", "\"We've not had a convo about what happens after that.\"\nSERIOUSLY?  You're already seeing a huge red flag regarding her paying NOW and you are just assuming everything will work out fine after marriage?  ESH", "I think you need to sit down and have a serious conversation about your relationship, goals, money, etc before taking it further with marriage. Are you planning on having a joint account for household expenses like the mortgage, utilities, groceries, etc? Are you planning to add her name to the deed and mortgage? If not, you are treating her like a roommate by having her pay nearly 40% for a house that is only in your name! It would be more fair for each of you to contribute a proportional amount to a joint account for household expenses. This is a partnership and having it be fair and equitable is important, especially considering the age gap and she makes less than you.", "Yes I am aware of what rent is. That said it seems like there is a disconnect in their relationship- and given that she is not on his mortgage I was speculating that she may feel more inclined to contribute towards the joint expenses in a different way. At least with a lease there are some protections in place. Here she is paying $ towards his mortgage and should something happen and they break up she has only squatters rights to fall back on if he were to ask her to immediately leave.", "Is this why she is now an ex-wife? How long did he put up with this for?", "\"Wifely bedroom duties\"? Honestly, that gives me the creeps, man. Just say they stopped having sex. Don't go all 1950s on us.", "And now he filed for divorce? Right?", "That's what renting is, paying someone else's mortgage."]}
