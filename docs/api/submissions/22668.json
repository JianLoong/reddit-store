My sister(26F) has always been a bit of a wild child, my mom and dad had me very young and then had trouble conceiving my sister. They also had lots of marriage issues and fights and they basically had my sister to try to fix the relationship. As you can imagine that didn\u2019t help and when my sister was 16 they had a divorce. My sister stayed with my mom and then she left at 20 to go live with her bf. She got into meth and it went downhill from there.\n\nMy wife and I have a prenup, we also have our finances organized that we pay a certain amount to a joint account and have our own accounts for personal use (fun stuff and family use). I knew I probably need to help my sister and parents more than my wife who\u2019s family is wealthy so I requested it like this. She makes $110k a year and I make $160k a year so we are fairly high income. 70% of our income goes to the joint account for joint bills like mortgage, utilities etc and to continuity to retirement. 30% is for our personal usage. For me that\u2019s around $36k a year in my individual account. But I also have student loans and auto loans that I pay. So it\u2019s closer to $25k left for personal use. My wife has no debt, she is overall better with money so she has a lot more discretionary income.\n\nI tried to keep the fact my sister is on drugs away from my wife. She is very judgmental of people who aren\u2019t perfect (ie does everything to further themselves) and would consider my sister a lost cause. She\u2019s met her once but aside from knowing she smokes some weed I keep her out of my family issues. My parents especially my mom expect me to help my sister because it\u2019s my job as the older brother. I set her up with an apartment that I paid for and food and just expected her get sober and find a job and she trashed the floor and I had to pay $6k in damages because I co-signed and I didn\u2019t want it in go on my record. I got her $5k in dental work and more in other medical bills. Financially I have no money to myself as the joint account can\u2019t be touched. \n\nNow my sister says she wants to go to rehab. I\u2019m really hoping against hope this will fix her addiction but it might take more than once to do it. It costs $30k for 6 months and I don\u2019t have the money. I\u2019m being pressured by my mom to pay for it and I have no choice but to go to my wife and ask to borrow against the joint account. She demands to know where it\u2019s going and I said my sister needs help and she won\u2019t budge because we have separate accounts for a reason. Finally I tell her about the drug abuse and rehab costs and how I don\u2019t have a penny left in my own savings or checking and she throws a fit for not telling her and absolutely refuses to allow a dime to go to it. It\u2019s half my money in there so I should be able to take out my half but the prenup says I can\u2019t take it out without my wife\u2019s approval. Which she won\u2019t give. She says I\u2019m choosing my sister over her and our son and if it continues she will leave. I think she needs to understand she\u2019s my sister and yes she hasn\u2019t made good choices but I need to help her. Also we have savings and we are well off enough it feels like she is being selfish.", "created_utc": 1689783311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153zfdf/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_about_my_sister/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It shouldn't be because your parents should be helping her or the government should be, but that's a moot point. \n\nYou can't spring this kind of financial blow to your joint account and not expect your wife to be p\\*\\*sed at you for not being up front from the beginning.", "YTA. Im going to say something very harsh here. Help without accountability is enabling. You drained your personal accounts taking care of her and now want to use the \"family\" account to send her to rehab. Rehab is not a magical cure for addiction. Its purpose to help during the early stage of recovery and to connect with other services/programs. Yoir wife is scared that youll drain that account as well, then youll start asking fir whats in your accounts.", " Holly hell Batman yta! You have let your mom and sister drain you dry. The only reason you have a pot to piss in is because your wife was smart enough to make you sign a prenup and set up finances the way she did.\n\nShe is absolutely right you are choosing your mom and grown ass sister over your wife and son. You are trying to take money from them to help 2 grown ass adults that are not your responsibility.\n\nYou need to get your priorities in check or your son will grow up knowing it\u2019s your fault his family was destroyed! Decide who is more important! \n\nYou need to cut the strings and tell mommy her little monster is no longer your problem. That you are no longer their damn atm machine! If you don\u2019t your wife needs to lawyer up and take half of everything. It be better that your son have it then some grown ass adult that has opportunity after opportunity but continues to choose the  wrong path at your expense! Good for your wife to stand her ground and not let your toxic ass family bleed you dry because you can\u2019t stand up to them.\n\nGo to therapy! You need it. Stop letting your family use you and bleed you dry before you loose your wife and son!", "Damn YTA. \n\nShe is your wife. \n\nAnd your sister isn\u2019t your responsibility.", "YTA You are lighting yourself and your family on fire to keep your sister warm. And all she is interested in is lighting her joints with the flames. Your wife should divorce you for lying.", "YTA\n\nThank whoever for your wife insisting on a prenup.\n\nHer family saw you coming and probably couldn't convince your wife to not marry you so put the prenup in place.\n\nYou earn more than your wife.\n\nYou have kept your sister's addiction from your wife as \"she's judgemental\" but I think the real reason is that she would call you out on your bullshit!\n\nYou have blown your individual savings and now you want to blow your joint savings.\n\nYou need to either stop enabling your sister and your parents or your wife will (quite rightly IMO) leave you.", "YTA. Thank your wife for having the backbone you lack when it comes to telling mommy \"no.\"", "YTA. Your primary responsibility is to your spouse and children. Helping your sister has eaten through about $25k/year for however long you've been supporting her; and now you want to start draining funds from your wife/kids to pay for it.\n\nYour sister is family, I understand that. However she, and your parents, have been taking advantage of you. If you insist on helping use your own discretionary income, and I would tell the parents pressuring you to cover at least half.", "YTA. You co-signed an apartment and expected her to get clean and find a job? Really? What steps was she currently taking that made this a possible outcome? Rehab only works when the person really desires it. Suddenly your sister wants rehab but she or you have already co Vince\u2019s yourself it won\u2019t take the first time? You have enabled her addiction by not making demands of any help you gave her. You have lied to your wife since before you got married. You said yourself your wife is better with money and yet you are upset she won\u2019t come down to your level and throw money at a problem that A isn\u2019t hers and B has a very high percent of failing? \n\nWhy aren\u2019t your parents paying for her rehab? Why do they expect this from you? You are not your sisters keeper and thank goodness because you haven\u2019t done a great job of it either. I won\u2019t say sister is a lost cause but until she really truly wants to get sober and personally feels the cost and weight of that choice, she won\u2019t commit 100%. She will believe you will keep paying for it or co-signing apartments or anything she needs. Stop now. This is harming her and potentially ruining your marriage", "YTA. All you did was enable your sister. Your parents are the AH for pressuring you to financially enable her. YTA to yourself because you make 160k annually and you have ZERO personal savings because you are enabling your sister. You really need to back away and let her figure it out. There are plenty of free rehabs.", "Yta - you've already spent ALL your money on your sister and now you want to take money from your wife and son? Absolutely not.", "YTA\n\nYour sister has made her choices and fleeced you.\n\nShe may be family, but you've done more than enough to help her.\n\nLet Mom and Sis know the ATM is closed.\n\nApologize to your wife.\n\nGood Luck", "YTA. You have lied to your wife for seven years about your sisters drug addiction. Worse, what you\u2019ve done to \u2018help\u2019 your sister was to throw money at her, cross your fingers & hope that she\u2019ll get better. There are ways to finance drug treatment programs that do not involve writing a huge one time check out of an account held jointly with your wife. It\u2019s time to treat your wife like a partner instead of demanding she fork over money for a problem she is just now learning about. I\u2019m not saying you should not help your sister.I\u2019m saying don\u2019t be so secretive, ashamed and stupid in how you go about it.", "YTA. YOURE ALSO ENABLING YOUR SISTER BY PAYING FOR HER TO ESSENTIALLY CONTINUE BEING A DRUG ADDICT. She\u2019s never going to get better or hit rock bottom if you keep covering her. She won\u2019t get clean until she actually wants too and it\u2019s pretty obvious that\u2019s not in the cards for at the moment. You and your mom are just making things worse at this point. You\u2019re also being a huge AH to your wife and kid. Your sister is your sister but it\u2019s not your job to support another adult  as they self destruct and continue to make bad decisions which could negatively impact your family. So do you really want to give up your family/marriage for your sister who will just ultimately bleed you dry?0", "YTA\n\nIt's a hard thing to swallow, but you're facilitating your sisters addiction with the sheer dollar amount you've been throwing at her for her drugs and living. Make no mistake, you've been funding as much of it that she can squeeze out of you. \n\nStop enabling her. \n\nI get it. It's your sister.  However, you have a wife and child.  There comes a point in time where the person who's been getting the hand-ups and hand-outs needs to sort themselves out. If they really want to, they will and it shouldn't come at the expense of your wife and child.  Even more so since you've clearly been lying to your wife all this time. \n\nSTOP ENABLING HER", "YTA.    you have 25K a year for your own personal spending money and it's  all gone to your sister  for years ?\nYou have a smart wife. I wouldn't  give you a dime out of joint account\n\nSister can move home  with mom, take the rent money and a bank loan (to be repaid  out of your money) to pay for her rehab.", "YTA for trying to use joint money. And just so you know, it is NOT your \u201cjob as the older brother\u201d to support your sister. Stand up to your mom and tell her it\u2019s her (and your dad\u2019s) child, their responsibility.", "YTA.\n\nStop allowing your mom to guilt trip you. Your responsibility as your wife and your son. \n\nYour sister is proven what type of person she is, believe her. \n\nWhen she\u2019s ready to get clean, she will. And it usually takes more than one rehab visit to make it stick.", "YTA...It's time you start to prioritize your responsibilities at home and let the rest of your family fend for themselves.  You've now backed yourself into a corner financially.  This should be a wake up call for you. It's not just your sister who hasn't made good choices, but you as well.", "Wow. Just wow. Your wife and your son are your family now. Stop enabling your sister. YTA", "YTA. \n\nYour sister isn't just a casual drug user, so while you worried your wife might judge her, just from what you write in your post, she would have been right to judge her. Now I'm not saying drug users are evil and shouldn't have help, but your sister has drained your resources, caused extensive property damage, and probably a lot of emotional turmoil in her family's life. That is why a lot of people do cut off drug users, because they aren't just drowning but will pull you down with them. \n\nOf course you should help your sister, but you have drained ALL your financial resources besides the joint account. So what happens if you or your wife get laid off? If your house burns down, if someone gets sick, if there is some other emergency? THAT is why your wife doesn't want you to take $30k from the joint account, because you have already shown a lack of forethought in terms of the financial safety of your family. Your wife now sees that should a financial emergency come up, it is going to be on only her to solve, because you have no money and aren't even thinking about what that means. She can't trust you, and that is a situation you created. \n\nI don't want to be too harsh on you, because having a relative that has a substance abuse problem is tough, and there isn't a clear guide to how to help, or when your help isn't enough. The analogy I give is that of someone drowning. Your sister is drowning in her addiction, and from the shore you have thrown her a life preserver (money) that she has thrown off (ruined the apartment), she has pushed away the lifeguard who came out to help her (all the other money you have given her), you threw her a line to pull her in (all the help your family has given her before), and now, if you swim out to her, she will pull you down with her. Your wife is asking you to not swim out there and put yourself- and your family- in danger. \n\nThere are other rehab programs that don't cost this, your parents can help, take out loans, or other things. You can find other ways to help, including paying a portion. But you have lied to your wife for your sister, drained your finances for your sister, and now because of her and your choices, your marriage is in jeopardy. And yet, you call your wife selfish?", "YTA. Your sister isn\u2019t a casual drug user she\u2019s a junkie. and it seems like your family has already pretty much cleaned you out financially. Why is this your wife\u2019s responsibility? You weren\u2019t even honest with her. Are you willing to implode your entire marriage because your sister can\u2019t control herself?", "YTA.  You've been deceiving your wife this whole time - where did she think you spent $11k?  You probably also shot your yourself in the foot with this approach - you come to your wife asking for $30K to spend on rehab when she just finds out you've already blown over $10K on her drug problems, and you thought that was going to go over well?  \n\nIt is not your job to take care of your sister, and it's a blessing that your wife has the ability for you to stop throwing money away like that.", "YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA your sister needs to figure this out and your mom if she so chooses. You better hope your wife doesn't leave you  then you will get your half but be paying it back in child support.", "YTA you don\u2019t need to help her. Your sister IS a lost cause. I\u2019m sorry but dealing with addiction is tough. You need to love them from afar. I have an aunt and uncle who are just like this and honestly you need to set your foot down at some point because your sister doesn\u2019t care at the end of the day.", "YTA you kept very important information from your wife. \n\nThat all being said, it is not your responsibility to help your sister. SHE is responsible for herself. For years it seems you and your parents have enabled her more than actually helped. \n\nPlease check into Al-Anon. It is a wonderful organization for people who have those close to them with addictions. \n\nYou can love and support your sister without the financial piece. \n\nAnd apologize to your wife!", "YTA because you\u2019ve been enabling your sister presumably for years. There\u2019s a reason why money and drug addicts test families apart. This is it. \n\nYou\u2019ve already spent so much money on her and guess what, one stint in rehab probably won\u2019t get her clean long term, unfortunately. \n\nYou tried to help her. Now your wife is trying to protect your son and family life. Good for your wife for ensuring that your sister can\u2019t affect her nephew\u2019s life.", "Unfortunately, as much as you mean well YTA\nAnd your wife is well within her rights for not wanting to further enable your sister. You\u2019ve already drained your personal account due to her issues, so where does it stop when she relapses after rehab? You\u2019re going to take more money?\n\nIf she\u2019s not ready to get help, rehab isn\u2019t going to work.", "YTA and she deserves a better husband.  Fix yourself or lose her", "YTA for actually thinking it is your responsibility to help your sister. She has pissed your money away and you just keep giving her more. Your responsibility (and the money in the joint account) is for your nuclear family - your wife and child and you. It is not \u201chalf yours\u201d.", "Yta you want to waste your own spending money? Go for it. You dont get to waste your wifes and sons money.\n\nTake out a loan if you want.  Or your *parents* can pay.  If its your job as the brother, its certainly their job as the parents.", "YTA. You say you \u201cshould\u201d be able to spend the money in the joint fund without her permission, but that\u2019s not what you agreed to when you married her (in a prenup no less). That money\u2019s for your shared goals. \n\nYou have at least a few reasonable choices here: You could be an idiot and divorce her and then spend whatever you want (after alimony, support, etc. is taken out). You could stay married and use only your personal funds. Best, you could stop spending extravagant amounts on someone who doesn\u2019t add to your life and possibly enabling their dangerous behavior.\n\nETA: I just read you tricked your wife into marrying you. Sending more \u201carse\u201d points your way.", "You have mislead your wife for your entire marriage, have spent thousands of dollars on something behind her back (yes, it\u2019s your agreed upon money to do with what you wish, but hiding this from your spouse is a pretty major), and now you expect your wife to put up family or personal savings that likely only exist because of the safeguards of the prenup, and you think she\u2019s out of line? YTA. Her statements regarding this are entirely valid. This is such a huge breach of trust. Your parents suck too. I\u2019m sorry for the position they\u2019ve put you in and the guilt they\u2019ve saddled you with, but it doesn\u2019t excuse any of what you\u2019ve done here.", "I feel for you. I have a sibling who was in a similar situation for a long time. \n\nI\u2019m going to tell you the hard truth that I had to learn for myself and you\u2019re in the middle of learning: helping them by making sure they have a place to live, food to eat, a car, etc is just enabling them. You\u2019re giving them the support they need in order to continue their destructive behavior, especially because you\u2019re giving it without any conditions. You have to realize that your sister isn\u2019t your sister right now. Shes not the same person you grew up with and loved. She\u2019s someone else because the drugs matter more to her than literally anything else. That\u2019s how addiction works.\n\nYour sister will take everything you\u2019re willing to give, and then she\u2019ll take even more that you aren\u2019t if you give her the opportunity. Not because your sister is a shit person, but because her addiction is more powerful than anything else.\n\nMy sibling went to rehab multiple times. None of them made a difference and they were back on drugs almost as soon as it was over. \n\nEventually my sibling went through something that did make them realize how lost they were. Been sober for almost 7 years now. I gave tens of thousands through the years to help. And still they stole from me if they ever needed more. \n\nWhen I stopped enabling them they were finally able to hit rock bottom and realize for themselves what their life had become. That\u2019s when something changed.\n\nHiding this from your wife makes you an asshole. Sorry, but it does. Your first responsibility is to her and your child. You don\u2019t have a responsibility to care for your sibling. You may feel a duty, but it\u2019s one you put on yourself. Your sister is responsible for her own care, full stop. Your wife is right that you are potentially putting your own chosen family in jeopardy to fund your sister\u2019s addiction. These should be choices you make together because it has the potential to affect all of you, not just you: YTA, and I\u2019m sorry to have to say so.\n\nGood luck, OP. I know this situation sucks because I\u2019ve been in it. I was like you for a long time, minus the hiding it from my wife. Eventually I learned I needed to stop before I lost everything myself, despite my guilt and love for my sibling. I hope you learn that lesson before it\u2019s too late.\n\nP.S.

The people who are telling you to stop enabling your sister are ignoring the fact that you are actually trying to get her the most important help she needs: rehab.

It's essential to apologize for keeping this from her, keep those lines of communication open, and give her some time to process everything.

With that being said, please hear me out. As hard as this is for you to hear, by providing her an apartment, and food, you have enabled her to continue on with her drug addiction without having to face any consequences at this point.  The chances of her actually being serious about staying in rehab are slim, and through experience, I've learned that once you pay, and she decides to walk out the door, you will not get your money back. Your wife should have been told about her, but I do understand your hesitance to do so, as most people do not know what it is like for an addict to live like that. They don't realize the shame they feel, nor the pull of the drug being so strong. Most people don't realize that in some cases it is the parents who actually start their kids' drugs use by having their kids indulge with them at a young age. It's easy to judge a book by its cover and never open it to read what's really inside. Your wife seems like one of those people, however, your mother is also wrong in making you feel that you have to continue to provide for your sister, causing problems for you financially with your wife. Being placed in this situation is not fair to you either. There are other programs out there for your sister if she is serious about wanting to get off the drugs. She could start by contacting Narcotics Anonymous and they can put her in touch with the right people to give her a leg up on her dependency. Please do not end your marriage over something you are not responsible for. Your sister chose to do this on her own, and you cannot fix her, only she can fix herself. You have gone the extra mile for her multiple times, but until you stop bailing her out of her situation, she will continue to choose her path of self-destruction believing that she'll always have you to fall back on to support her financially.

My sister(26F) has always been a bit of a wild child, my mom and dad had me very young and then had trouble conceiving my sister. They also had lots of marriage issues and fights and they basically had my sister to try to fix the relationship. As you can imagine that didn\u2019t help and when my sister was 16 they had a divorce. My sister stayed with my mom and then she left at 20 to go live with her bf. She got into meth and it went downhill from there.\n\nMy wife and I have a prenup, we also have our finances organized that we pay a certain amount to a joint account and have our own accounts for personal use (fun stuff and family use). I knew I probably need to help my sister and parents more than my wife who\u2019s family is wealthy so I requested it like this. She makes $110k a year and I make $160k a year so we are fairly high income. 70% of our income goes to the joint account for joint bills like or mortgage, utilities etc and 30% if for our personal usage. For me that\u2019s around $36k a year in my individual account. But I also have student loans and auto loans that I pay. So it\u2019s closer to $25k left for personal use. My wife has no debt, she is overall better with money so she has a lot more discretionary income.\n\nI tried to keep the fact my sister is on drugs away from my wife. She is very judgmental of people who aren\u2019t perfect (ie does everything to further themselves) and would consider my sister a lost cause. She\u2019s met her once but aside from knowing she smokes some weed I keep her out of my family issues. My parents especially my mom expect me to help my sister because it\u2019s my job as the older brother. I set her up with an apartment that I paid for and food and just expected her get sober and find a job and she trashed the floor and I had to pay $6k in damages because I co-signed and I didn\u2019t want it in go on my record. I got her $5k in dental work and other medical bills. Financially I have no money to myself as the joint account can\u2019t be touched. \n\nNow my sister says she wants to go to rehab. I\u2019m really hoping against hope this will fix her addiction but it might take more than once to do it. It costs $30k for 6 months and I don\u2019t have the money. I\u2019m being pressured by my mom to pay for it and I have no choice but to go to my wife and ask to borrow against the joint account. She demands to know where it\u2019s going and I said my sister needs help and she won\u2019t budge because we have separate accounts for a reason. Finally I tell her about the drug abuse and rehab costs and she throws a fit for not telling her and absolutely refuses to allow a dime to go to it. It\u2019s half my money in there so I should be able to take out my half but the prenup says I can\u2019t take it out without my wife\u2019s approval. Which she won\u2019t give. She says I\u2019m choosing my sister over her and our son and if it continues she will leave. I think she needs to understand she\u2019s my sister and yes she hasn\u2019t made good choices but I need to help her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He knows she won't give permission for him to throw more money away.\n\nHe earns $160k. 70% of that goes into joint savings, so that's $112k that goes towards joint expenses. He had $36k per year in fun money, with $25,000 for his personal use each year, and yet he has no savings because he's consistently spent a fortune on his sister and mother. At no point had that been enough.

Why didn\u2019t you send her to rehab from the start, instead of blowing all your money on enabling her addiction, and now expecting your wife and kid to be the ones to pay for it?

You believe you are helping your sister when you are in fact making her situation so much more dangerous by enabling her drug use. YOU NEED TO STOP THAT, like yesterday. \n\nYou love your sister and you want to help her. Of course you do. But giving her money is not helping and no matter what you tell yourself, it won't help.  Giving her money is not love either. Love is making the hard, uncomfortable choices to ensure those we love are safe ultimately. Giving her money is pretty much doing the opposite of that, sadly.\n\n If you have trouble understanding any of these, please, PLEASE, get yourself to therapy asap.

But some of your finances are separate, and you've always agreed to use them how you please. And I think theres an argument to be made that if your wife expects you to open up about these things, she needs to learn to be less judgmental. However, expecting your wife to agree to $30k is a lot to ask. Is this a typical amount for rehab where you live? Is there a free or lower cost option that could be used instead? \n\nI think its important to adjust your mindset about your sister's addiction and understand that its not as simple as going to rehab and \"fixing\" it. I'd suggest looking into whether there are any services/resources/counselling/groups for friends/family of loved ones with addictions in your area. I think it would help if you and your family got some support for yourselves as this is a lot for you to be going through, also, they may be able to provide some guidance about how to best support your sister.

Again, this is all in the post. Each spouse contributes 70% of their income to the joint account, and all personal expenses and discretionary spending come from the remaining 30%. I don't bring that up to suggest he has any right to unilaterally withdraw from the joint account; I just don't think it's correct to act as if she's \"working to support the family\" while he sneaks around freeloading and stuffing drugs into his sister."]}
