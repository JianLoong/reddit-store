{"id": 30687, "submission_id": "17ry6pz", "title": "AITA for getting upset with my parents for offering my food to my sister?", "selftext": "Hello this is the first time I am doing this. Hopefully I do this right.\n\nUnfortunately I (20 F) am lactose and gluten intolerant. I have been lactose intolerant for around 6 years and I recently noticed symptoms of gluten intolerance. Therefore, I've gone on a gluten and dairy free diet. (I've been on a dairy free diet for many years). I have to admit I'm not very good at being strict about it, but I'm getting better. Tonight I was making a lil smokeys recipe that didn't have a any gluten or dairy in it. My family, Dad, mom, little sister(15 F), and little brother (10 M) was having a beef broccoli casserole which has dairy in it. My little sister, let's call her Emma, is a picky eater, often based on mood. One thing she doesn't really like is that casserole.\n I was in the kitchen making my own meal with the rest of my family when this all transpired. My mom asked Emma if she wanted the casserole. No. Do you want the plain beef? No. Do you want me to make you a salad? No. Well do you want some of OP's food? Yeah. \nI was immediately taken a back. I asked my mom why she offered my food to Emma without asking if it was okay first. She told me it wouldn't hurt me to share. I then reminded her that I bought the smokies myself with my own money. She then scoffed and told me that I was being ridiculous for not sharing with my sister. Here's the thing, I don't mind sharing my food with my family members. My problem was that my mother offered my food and this isn't the first time she's done so. I tried to communicate this with her but she wasn't having it. My entire family was in the kitchen at this point, so my dad got involved.\n As I was trying to get my point across to my parents then started laughing and joking around. \"Good thing we give you the food we buy.\" \"Good thing we give you food huh?\" I might be the AH here, but I told them that is the job of a parent is to provide for their children. (I'm still living with them. And I'm going to college currently, I promise I'm not a lazy child taking advantage of my parents) I stuttered when I said that so my dad mocked me by repeating my stutter. What they said made me very upset so I tried to communicate that to them. I asked them to please stop and that I was upset that my food was offered without me being asked first and that was the only issue. At this point it was just me and my mother again. She told me I was being very disrespectful for talking back to her and dad and that I need to knock it off. She told me that I am very dramatic and I can't let things go. It's been a couple days but this has made me very upset and I don't know if I am in the wrong. I don't work much since I'm in college. I also don't have a car so I can't drive to work more so money is tight.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall Update to answer questions.\n\nI believe some people have missed some details because my post was hard to read (sorry about that). I cut some things out because I was over the word limit. \n\nI do pay a yearly rent of around $500 which is fine. I help out around the house by doing many chores, cooking dinner, looking after my siblings, mowing, ect. When I get my car I'm also expected to be a chauffeur.\n\nI bought the food with my OWN money\n\nI DON'T MIND SHARING. I usually share with my siblings when I make my own food because they want to try it or taste it. \n\nThis isn't the first time my mom has done this. She has offered my food to herself and my siblings on many occasions. Not long ago she offered food that I bought from hellofresh to one my siblings (10 M) just because he wanted to taste it. An entire bowl of soup...It only supplied two bowls. \n\nMy mom is the type of person to not recognize invisible illnesses. It took her 4 years to recognize that I am lactose intolerant. It took her even longer to recognize that I have an autoimmune disorder (a whole other story). \n\nThat night was the straw that broke the camel's back in a way. I finally caught her in the act of giving my food away without asking so I thought I could respectfully confront her. \n\nMy parents treat me as an adult in some areas but they don't treat me as an adult in other areas. I'm expected to do adult things and have adult responsibilities but I don't have the privilege of having reasonable adult boundaries.", "created_utc": 1699598477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ry6pz/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_parents_for/", "score": 1683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Utterly foul behaviour. \n\nDon\u2019t let them beat you down.

If they are the ones picking up the food, they will ask what I want (let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s one of those chicken strip boxes from Dairy Queen). They will order the food and my mom will claim she doesn\u2019t want any fries or whatever\u2026 and then by the time they get home and give me my box of food, there\u2019s almost nothing left in it. Four of the six chicken strips are gone and there\u2019s maybe three or four fries left. And they just eat all of it on top of eating their own food. Why would you bother asking what I wanted if you\u2019re just gonna eat it all yourself and give me scraps?

Hopefully I do this right.\n\nUnfortunately I (20 F) am lactose and gluten intolerant. I have been lactose intolerant for around 6 years and I recently noticed symptoms of gluten intolerance. Therefore, I've gone on a gluten and dairy free diet. (I've been on a dairy free diet for many years). I have to admit I'm not very good at being strict about it, but I'm getting better. Tonight I was making a lil smokeys recipe that didn't have a any gluten or dairy in it. My family, Dad, mom, little sister(15 F), and little brother (10 M) was having a beef broccoli casserole which has dairy in it. My little sister, let's call her Emma, is a picky eater, often based on mood. One thing she doesn't really like is that casserole.\n I was in the kitchen making my own meal with the rest of my family when this all transpired. My mom asked Emma if she wanted the casserole. No. Do you want the plain beef? No. Do you want me to make you a salad? No. Well do you want some of OP's food? Yeah. \nI was immediately taken a back. I asked my mom why she offered my food to Emma without asking if it was okay first. She told me it wouldn't hurt me to share. I then reminded her that I bought the smokies myself with my own money. She then scoffed and told me that I was being ridiculous for not sharing with my sister. Here's the thing, I don't mind sharing my food with my family members. My problem was that my mother offered my food and this isn't the first time she's done so. I tried to communicate this with her but she wasn't having it. My entire family was in the kitchen at this point, so my dad got involved.\n As I was trying to get my point across to my parents then started laughing and joking around. \"Good thing we give you the food we buy.\" \"Good thing we give you food huh?\" I might be the AH here, but I told them that is the job of a parent is to provide for their children. (I'm still living with them. And I'm going to college currently, I promise I'm not a lazy child taking advantage of my parents) I stuttered when I said that so my dad mocked me by repeating my stutter. What they said made me very upset so I tried to communicate that to them. I asked them to please stop and that I was upset that my food was offered without me being asked first and that was the only issue. At this point it was just me and my mother again. She told me I was being very disrespectful for talking back to her and dad and that I need to knock it off. She told me that I am very dramatic and I can't let things go. It's been a couple days but this has made me very upset and I don't know if I am in the wrong. I don't work much since I'm in college. I also don't have a car so I can't drive to work more so money is tight.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
