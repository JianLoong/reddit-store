Hopefully I do this right.\n\nUnfortunately I (20 F) am lactose and gluten intolerant. I have been lactose intolerant for around 6 years and I recently noticed symptoms of gluten intolerance. Therefore, I've gone on a gluten and dairy free diet. (I've been on a dairy free diet for many years). I have to admit I'm not very good at being strict about it, but I'm getting better. Tonight I was making a lil smokeys recipe that didn't have a any gluten or dairy in it. My family, Dad, mom, little sister(15 F), and little brother (10 M) was having a beef broccoli casserole which has dairy in it. My little sister, let's call her Emma, is a picky eater, often based on mood. One thing she doesn't really like is that casserole.\n I was in the kitchen making my own meal with the rest of my family when this all transpired. My mom asked Emma if she wanted the casserole. No. Do you want the plain beef? No. Do you want me to make you a salad? No. Well do you want some of OP's food? Yeah. \nI was immediately taken a back. I asked my mom why she offered my food to Emma without asking if it was okay first. She told me it wouldn't hurt me to share. I then reminded her that I bought the smokies myself with my own money. She then scoffed and told me that I was being ridiculous for not sharing with my sister. Here's the thing, I don't mind sharing my food with my family members. My problem was that my mother offered my food and this isn't the first time she's done so. I tried to communicate this with her but she wasn't having it. My entire family was in the kitchen at this point, so my dad got involved.\n As I was trying to get my point across to my parents then started laughing and joking around. \"Good thing we give you the food we buy.\" \"Good thing we give you food huh?\" I might be the AH here, but I told them that is the job of a parent is to provide for their children. (I'm still living with them. And I'm going to college currently, I promise I'm not a lazy child taking advantage of my parents) I stuttered when I said that so my dad mocked me by repeating my stutter. What they said made me very upset so I tried to communicate that to them. I asked them to please stop and that I was upset that my food was offered without me being asked first and that was the only issue. At this point it was just me and my mother again. She told me I was being very disrespectful for talking back to her and dad and that I need to knock it off. She told me that I am very dramatic and I can't let things go. It's been a couple days but this has made me very upset and I don't know if I am in the wrong. I don't work much since I'm in college. I also don't have a car so I can't drive to work more so money is tight.", "created_utc": 1699598477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ry6pz/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_parents_for/", "score": 630, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't eat what everyone else is having and the fact that the family already had their own food but expected OP to give up hers because her sister is a picky eater??

Utterly foul behaviour. \n\nDon\u2019t let them beat you down.

Even if your parents paid for your food, she should have asked BEFORE offering it to your sister. \nAnd then to add your medical diet restrictions justakes it even worse. \n\nAnd at 10, your sis surely can understand why you cannot eat the family meal.

Hopefully I do this right.\n\nUnfortunately I (20 F) am lactose and gluten intolerant. I have been lactose intolerant for around 6 years and I recently noticed symptoms of gluten intolerance. Therefore, I've gone on a gluten and dairy free diet. (I've been on a dairy free diet for many years). I have to admit I'm not very good at being strict about it, but I'm getting better. Tonight I was making a lil smokeys recipe that didn't have a any gluten or dairy in it. My family, Dad, mom, little sister(15 F), and little brother (10 M) was having a beef broccoli casserole which has dairy in it. My little sister, let's call her Emma, is a picky eater, often based on mood. One thing she doesn't really like is that casserole.\n I was in the kitchen making my own meal with the rest of my family when this all transpired. My mom asked Emma if she wanted the casserole. No. Do you want the plain beef? No. Do you want me to make you a salad? No. Well do you want some of OP's food? Yeah. \nI was immediately taken a back. I asked my mom why she offered my food to Emma without asking if it was okay first. She told me it wouldn't hurt me to share. I then reminded her that I bought the smokies myself with my own money. She then scoffed and told me that I was being ridiculous for not sharing with my sister. Here's the thing, I don't mind sharing my food with my family members. My problem was that my mother offered my food and this isn't the first time she's done so. I tried to communicate this with her but she wasn't having it. My entire family was in the kitchen at this point, so my dad got involved.\n As I was trying to get my point across to my parents then started laughing and joking around. \"Good thing we give you the food we buy.\" \"Good thing we give you food huh?\" I might be the AH here, but I told them that is the job of a parent is to provide for their children. (I'm still living with them. And I'm going to college currently, I promise I'm not a lazy child taking advantage of my parents) I stuttered when I said that so my dad mocked me by repeating my stutter. What they said made me very upset so I tried to communicate that to them. I asked them to please stop and that I was upset that my food was offered without me being asked first and that was the only issue. At this point it was just me and my mother again. She told me I was being very disrespectful for talking back to her and dad and that I need to knock it off. She told me that I am very dramatic and I can't let things go. It's been a couple days but this has made me very upset and I don't know if I am in the wrong. I don't work much since I'm in college. I also don't have a car so I can't drive to work more so money is tight.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
