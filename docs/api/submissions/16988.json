My sister has special needs and is disabled physically (she was born missing a foot). Ever since my sister started showing signs of being special needs my parents have been short tempered with me, they have expected me to grow up and never be selfish, never try to take time from her, to always be understanding of her and to never show I'm disappointed. My sister has trouble regulating her emotions, struggles with crowds, struggles with change and always needs something in her hand or she's screaming the house down and has been violently sick during a meltdown. They said she's considered developmentally delayed and that's why she behaves the way she does. I don't know everything though. My parents have always told people my sister is not autistic. \n\nOur life is ruled by my sister. We can have plans to go out to eat and if she's not responding well to a specific day it will be cancelled. My parents gave up after the first year on birthday parties for me and told me her comfort has to come first. When they told me they got firm and said they did not want to see me cry, or look upset, and would not take me making them feel bad. Another time I was supposed to be going to a friend's house. My dad didn't want them coming to the house and he couldn't get my sister into the car so he called and cancelled at the last minute. When I got upset he yelled at me and told me he was doing his best and mom was sick and why was I not helping out instead of \"trying to run off and enjoy myself like a little brat\". When we were all stuck at home, my sister got into holding onto one of our hands for hours. My parents were fine with it. I didn't like her doing it to me. I got yelled at for denying her the chance which made her cry. Then I got told I wasn't being a team player and was giving them a hard time when their life wasn't easy either. Another time I silent and had a sour face because she broke something of mine during a meltdown and my parents told me they were sick of my shit.\n\nEver since Christmas my sister has gotten so much worse and there have been no okay days, every day has been a bad one and they are in and out of hospital. I have stayed out of the way as much as I can and I want to be nowhere near my parents. Yesterday my parents asked me if I would help out more this weekend, spend time with my sister and give them a break. It was the nicest they have spoken to be in years. I said no anyway. They told me to be compassionate to them, they are drowning. I told them I will be as compassionate to them as they are to me and I am not going to do more for them than they are willing to do for me, their kid.\n\nMy parents told me I was being \"bratty for no reason\".

You are not a parent. If they need help, they need to hire help. Telling you that your feelings are invalid because they are struggling is just plain cruel. I hope you get out as soon as you can and never look back.", "NTA. Not only are your parents being unfair on you, and depriving you of a proper childhood, they are being unfair on your sister too: she will not always be able to rely on everyone treating her needs as sacrosanct, and your parents are not doing their job by failing to ensure she learns this growing up. \n\nBut, given your post is about how everything is always focused on your sister\u2019s needs, rather than your own, I think my reply should not echo this. So, *more importantly than their failure to teach your sister that she can\u2019t always have everything her own way*, their treatment of you is monumentally unfair, and almost heartbreaking to read. \n\nIf your sister reacts badly to you having a birthday party, that is not a reason for you not to have a birthday party. Your parents just need to expect and anticipate that reaction, rather than depriving you of having a birthday party. \n\nYour parents might say their behaviour is all about caring for your sister. It is not. It is about their selfishness in not wanting to have to deal with her reaction to things she doesn\u2019t like. Them telling you that you are not even allowed to cry or be upset about this borders on the monstrous. \n\nThem telling you that you\u2019re not being a team player is parentification. They made the decision to have another child, not you, and they have to live with the consequences. Sure, you might be appreciative of the fact they have a harder time with her than they might do with another child (it sounds like you are), but expecting you to be on their team and make all these sacrifices is simply awful. They might ask you to make small adaptations, and ask for understanding when they struggle, but they are asking you to basically sacrifice your childhood (why is it brattish for a teenager to want to go and see a friend in their spare time?!) - and they\u2019re also telling you that you have no right to be upset about this. \n\nI mean, honestly, getting angry at you for not letting her hold your hand for hours on end? It\u2019s your damn body\u2026does your supposed duty to the \u201cteam\u201d effort go so far as to involve giving up your right to bodily autonomy? \n\nThis all adds up to a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) but very insidious form of abuse. It makes me sad writing this and not being able to tell your parents how disgraceful and abusive their behaviour is.", "As a mother to a special needs kid, NTA at all. Holy fuck. Like, yeah, what they have to go through is tough as shit. And, yeah, there's really no way to keep your sister's needs from taking more priority over yours (and theirs). It sucks ass, but there's not a whole lot anyone can do about that. \n\nBut FUCK. To try to make you feel bad about *feeling bad*? That's some fucked up shit right there. You're still a kid too! Acknowledging what YOU have to go through in this situation, and not trying to invalidate your emotions/perspective completely, is the rock-bottom least they could do.", "NTA, to me it sounds like they are neglecting you for your little sister. While I understand she requires extra care and I\u2019m sure they are exhausted - your feelings are extremely valid and the way you describe it it doesn\u2019t seem as though they\u2019re nice to you unless they want something from you.", "NTA.  Your parents are abusive and abhorrent.  I am sad to hear about your sister but you deserve a life.  It wasn't your choice to have another child but are expected to act like it was.  Your parents are failing you big time.   \n\n\nNote: I have raised a family member with life threatening medical condition.  It sucks and incredibly hard but never treated the other family member as if it was there responsibility as your parents have done to you.  Yes, things get changed at the last minute but it isn't up to you to find the solution, it's your parents job to do that for both of their kids.  Nothing is going to change in that house.  Do you have any family to stay with at least temporarily for breaks and support?  If so, see to it is a possibility to do so.", "NTA. Your sister's needs aren't more special than yours. At 15, you can take more ownership of your life. Ride a bicycle to a friend's house. Join clubs and after school activities. Do anything and everything that you can to build a life outside of your house. Exist as an individual.", "NTA. While having a special needs kid can be difficult, that doesn\u2019t put them in the right to neglect you and assume you\u2019re okay with it.", "NTA, I'm so sorry to read this. Your parents are having a rough time, I get it , I wouldn't want to go through what they are for anything, but hope to high heaven that if I would not be like that. It doesn't excuse neglecting you, and to expect your help after so much neglect, it's appalling. You're far too young to be dealing with this, they need to find help from adults. There are professionals that can get them some relief,  depending on where you are, if they can't afford it, the state may be able to help. Good luck, keep your chin up and find someone you can confide in. Either a counselor or a teacher, or a trusted adult family member. You also shouldn't be handling this alone, with only strangers from the internet for advice.", "NTA, your parents sound genuinely terrible. Consider getting a job as soon as you're able so that you can save money and leave as soon as you're legally allowed", "NTA they stopped being your parents the second they pushed your Legitimate Needs to the side because \u2018they couldn\u2019t cope\u2019. Now they are just your sisters caretakers and your demanding inconsiderate roommates.", "NTA. please talk to your school social worker immediately. you are being neglected & verbally & emotionally abused. just bc your sister has more needs doesn\u2019t mean that your needs suddenly evaporated. do you have any other family you can live with? this sounds hellish & i\u2019m sorry you\u2019re living in it", "NTA. Your parents are handling this in the worst possibly way...both for your sister and in their neglect of your needs. They failed as parents. Please show them our comments.", "Oh man. I really feel for you, this is a terrible situation. Your parents really sound like they need some outside help dealing with your sister, and either can\u2019t or aren\u2019t getting assistance.\n\nI just want to say, not to defend your parents, but when we are young, we often don\u2019t realize how unprepared our parents were for parenting, in this case it\u2019s extra, since no one expects to have a child with special needs. What I mean is, you\u2019re not wrong for \u201cbeing a brat\u201d, AND it might make the situation easier if you can calmly state your needs to them, and start a real conversation about how y\u2019all can move forward in this situation.\n\nJust want to be clear that in an ideal world your parents should have never put you in this position, it\u2019s unfair. But, it\u2019s the situation you\u2019re in, and a lot of times people don\u2019t treat other people fairly, even when they should know better as parents. It\u2019s not right, but you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to meet them halfway to make the best path forward in an impossible situation. \n\nI truly hope you can figure out a way to make your parents understand your needs. And I hope they can somehow get some assistance with your sister. \n\nReally feel for you, good luck. Anyways NTA", "Nta, but you're 15. Please make sure you don't cause anymore trouble for yourself.

My mother had such harsh expectations of me and never got on his case for anything.      I have mixed feelings about it, but I became extremely self-sufficient as a result.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to encourage dependence on things that won\u2019t always be the case, but it\u2019s up to your mum. She is choosing to tactically avoid a bad reaction from your sister instead of strategically encourage other methods of self-regulation, that don\u2019t depend on others.

Or do they associate autism with a stigma, and are therefore avoiding getting her an assessment (and possible treatment). To avoid this would be a severe dereliction of their duty to both you and your sister: your sister because if it\u2019s possible that she has a medical condition, diagnosis and treatment should be an option for her; and you, because not only do you have to live in the orbit of your sister\u2019s behaviour, they are constantly asking you to make wholly unreasonable sacrifices to mitigate it.", "Well, yeah, sure it's easier. I am sure that somewhere in there, maybe on an unconscious level, they feel guilty for what all this puts on you. But it's not your responsibility to make your parents feel better.

You get shut down when you speak up , this is all abuse .", "Speaking to someone at your school is a really, really good idea. Even if the designated counsellor is not much help. Do you have a teacher you are close to, and would feel comfortable speaking to about it? I have a hard time imagining that any adult, especially one in a position of responsibility, would not feel compelled to help. Not sure whereabouts in the world you are (kinda get the feeling from your language you\u2019re in the US), but here in the UK, there are different people in most schools you can go to. If there\u2019s not a specific teacher (aside from the counsellor) with responsibility for pastoral care you can go to, then go to a teacher you like, or just go and speak to a deputy principal/head etc. My mum used to be a teacher in a special-educational-needs school, where many students had lots of pastoral/family issues, and I know that she would never have wanted a student to feel like they couldn\u2019t speak to her about issues at home, even if she had never interacted with them before.\n\nThis might also be a good way to get your parents into therapy, which is what I think you ultimately need as a family. I expect that your parents are absolutely exhausted, and ultimately keeping themselves going by adopting the defensive and untrue position that you are just a child, so you don\u2019t really understand/your opinion doesn\u2019t really count, both of which aren\u2019t true. Being defensive and unreasonable is a very human response to being exhausted, and running on empty. They need to be told by another adult, ideally one in a position of authority/responsibility, that their behaviour is out of line, and is letting both you and your sister down. \n\nEven if your parents can\u2019t be persuaded by an adult at your school, please believe me when I say that you will find your parents\u2019 behaviour easier to live with if you just find someone you can talk to about it!\n\nP.S. if you need to sell it to your parents, getting some therapy might make it easier for them to deal with your sister, not just with you."]}
