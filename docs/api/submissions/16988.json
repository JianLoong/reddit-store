My sister has special needs and is disabled physically (she was born missing a foot). Ever since my sister started showing signs of being special needs my parents have been short tempered with me, they have expected me to grow up and never be selfish, never try to take time from her, to always be understanding of her and to never show I'm disappointed. My sister has trouble regulating her emotions, struggles with crowds, struggles with change and always needs something in her hand or she's screaming the house down and has been violently sick during a meltdown. They said she's considered developmentally delayed and that's why she behaves the way she does. I don't know everything though. My parents have always told people my sister is not autistic. \n\nOur life is ruled by my sister. We can have plans to go out to eat and if she's not responding well to a specific day it will be cancelled. My parents gave up after the first year on birthday parties for me and told me her comfort has to come first. When they told me they got firm and said they did not want to see me cry, or look upset, and would not take me making them feel bad. Another time I was supposed to be going to a friend's house. My dad didn't want them coming to the house and he couldn't get my sister into the car so he called and cancelled at the last minute. When I got upset he yelled at me and told me he was doing his best and mom was sick and why was I not helping out instead of \"trying to run off and enjoy myself like a little brat\". When we were all stuck at home, my sister got into holding onto one of our hands for hours. My parents were fine with it. I didn't like her doing it to me. I got yelled at for denying her the chance which made her cry. Then I got told I wasn't being a team player and was giving them a hard time when their life wasn't easy either. Another time I silent and had a sour face because she broke something of mine during a meltdown and my parents told me they were sick of my shit.\n\nEver since Christmas my sister has gotten so much worse and there have been no okay days, every day has been a bad one and they are in and out of hospital. I have stayed out of the way as much as I can and I want to be nowhere near my parents. Yesterday my parents asked me if I would help out more this weekend, spend time with my sister and give them a break. It was the nicest they have spoken to be in years. I said no anyway. They told me to be compassionate to them, they are drowning. I told them I will be as compassionate to them as they are to me and I am not going to do more for them than they are willing to do for me, their kid.\n\nMy parents told me I was being \"bratty for no reason\".

You are not a parent. If they need help, they need to hire help. Telling you that your feelings are invalid because they are struggling is just plain cruel. I hope you get out as soon as you can and never look back.", "NTA. Not only are your parents being unfair on you, and depriving you of a proper childhood, they are being unfair on your sister too: she will not always be able to rely on everyone treating her needs as sacrosanct, and your parents are not doing their job by failing to ensure she learns this growing up. \n\nBut, given your post is about how everything is always focused on your sister\u2019s needs, rather than your own, I think my reply should not echo this. So, *more importantly than their failure to teach your sister that she can\u2019t always have everything her own way*, their treatment of you is monumentally unfair, and almost heartbreaking to read. \n\nIf your sister reacts badly to you having a birthday party, that is not a reason for you not to have a birthday party. Your parents just need to expect and anticipate that reaction, rather than depriving you of having a birthday party. \n\nYour parents might say their behaviour is all about caring for your sister. It is not. It is about their selfishness in not wanting to have to deal with her reaction to things she doesn\u2019t like. Them telling you that you are not even allowed to cry or be upset about this borders on the monstrous. \n\nThem telling you that you\u2019re not being a team player is parentification. They made the decision to have another child, not you, and they have to live with the consequences. Sure, you might be appreciative of the fact they have a harder time with her than they might do with another child (it sounds like you are), but expecting you to be on their team and make all these sacrifices is simply awful. They might ask you to make small adaptations, and ask for understanding when they struggle, but they are asking you to basically sacrifice your childhood (why is it brattish for a teenager to want to go and see a friend in their spare time?!) - and they\u2019re also telling you that you have no right to be upset about this. \n\nI mean, honestly, getting angry at you for not letting her hold your hand for hours on end? It\u2019s your damn body\u2026does your supposed duty to the \u201cteam\u201d effort go so far as to involve giving up your right to bodily autonomy? \n\nThis all adds up to a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) but very insidious form of abuse.

Acknowledging what YOU have to go through in this situation, and not trying to invalidate your emotions/perspective completely, is the rock-bottom least they could do.", "NTA, to me it sounds like they are neglecting you for your little sister.

It sucks and incredibly hard but never treated the other family member as if it was there responsibility as your parents have done to you.

Your parents are having a rough time, I get it , I wouldn't want to go through what they are for anything, but hope to high heaven that if I would not be like that. It doesn't excuse neglecting you, and to expect your help after so much neglect, it's appalling. You're far too young to be dealing with this, they need to find help from adults. There are professionals that can get them some relief,  depending on where you are, if they can't afford it, the state may be able to help. Good luck, keep your chin up and find someone you can confide in. Either a counselor or a teacher, or a trusted adult family member.

Your parents are handling this in the worst possibly way...both for your sister and in their neglect of your needs. They failed as parents. Please show them our comments.", "Oh man. I really feel for you, this is a terrible situation. Your parents really sound like they need some outside help dealing with your sister, and either can\u2019t or aren\u2019t getting assistance.\n\nI just want to say, not to defend your parents, but when we are young, we often don\u2019t realize how unprepared our parents were for parenting, in this case it\u2019s extra, since no one expects to have a child with special needs. What I mean is, you\u2019re not wrong for \u201cbeing a brat\u201d, AND it might make the situation easier if you can calmly state your needs to them, and start a real conversation about how y\u2019all can move forward in this situation.\n\nJust want to be clear that in an ideal world your parents should have never put you in this position, it\u2019s unfair. But, it\u2019s the situation you\u2019re in, and a lot of times people don\u2019t treat other people fairly, even when they should know better as parents. It\u2019s not right, but you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to meet them halfway to make the best path forward in an impossible situation. \n\nI truly hope you can figure out a way to make your parents understand your needs. And I hope they can somehow get some assistance with your sister. \n\nReally feel for you, good luck. Anyways NTA", "Nta, but you're 15. Please make sure you don't cause anymore trouble for yourself.

I have a hard time imagining that any adult, especially one in a position of responsibility, would not feel compelled to help. Not sure whereabouts in the world you are (kinda get the feeling from your language you\u2019re in the US), but here in the UK, there are different people in most schools you can go to. If there\u2019s not a specific teacher (aside from the counsellor) with responsibility for pastoral care you can go to, then go to a teacher you like, or just go and speak to a deputy principal/head etc. My mum used to be a teacher in a special-educational-needs school, where many students had lots of pastoral/family issues, and I know that she would never have wanted a student to feel like they couldn\u2019t speak to her about issues at home, even if she had never interacted with them before.\n\nThis might also be a good way to get your parents into therapy, which is what I think you ultimately need as a family. I expect that your parents are absolutely exhausted, and ultimately keeping themselves going by adopting the defensive and untrue position that you are just a child, so you don\u2019t really understand/your opinion doesn\u2019t really count, both of which aren\u2019t true. Being defensive and unreasonable is a very human response to being exhausted, and running on empty. They need to be told by another adult, ideally one in a position of authority/responsibility, that their behaviour is out of line, and is letting both you and your sister down. \n\nEven if your parents can\u2019t be persuaded by an adult at your school, please believe me when I say that you will find your parents\u2019 behaviour easier to live with if you just find someone you can talk to about it!\n\nP.S. if you need to sell it to your parents, getting some therapy might make it easier for them to deal with your sister, not just with you.", "NTA your parents are huge assholes and I'll tell them myself", "I wish life was easy.

If I was being treated that way and told over and over again I\u2019m a second class citizen to my disabled sibling I would call cps myself but that\u2019s just me!!

No. They have no respect for you, then you do not need to respect them. Respect is a two way street!!

Not just for their and your sake, but for hers. Your parents won\u2019t be around forever, and they need a plan (that isn\u2019t you, nor should it be you). If they can bring in nurses and social workers and therapists *now* they can help ease her into the transition. She can learn to rely on others besides your mom and dad, while your mom and dad are still there to help her through it.\n\nImagine if your sister got to 40, her parents and only caregivers pass away, and now she has to deal with complete strangers for the first time in her life. She won\u2019t handle it well, and it\u2019s setting her up for even more heartbreak and failure down the line.\n\nAnd you should be clear with them that you will not be their backup plan and you will not take care of her.

It denies your right to say no to other people touching you, is forcing you to fullfil a sibling's emotional needs in a way that may count as parentification, and it clearly shows favoritism.\n\nUnfortunately emotional abuse has to be very severe for CPS to care, and it is one of the more difficult patterns of abuse to describe.

It may come under some other name where you are, but it probably exists. It allows families of special needs kids to get some time away from the special needs kids occasionally.  And no, you are NTA, just human with a human need for occasionally being the important one, or at least to not always be relegated to be the unimportant one.", "NTA most definitely they are parentifying you and trying to guilt you into it.\n\nalso they're lying\u2014your sister IS autistic. im no doctor but i am, however, autistic myself and you mentioned every single criteria. she meets ALL of them.", "NTA.", "NTA but start picking up little jobs and hiding away cash.

It is perfectly reasonable to want to have their care and compassion too.", "NTA\n\nYou need to go No Contact as soon as you can as an adult because this will only get worse and your parents will eventually start making plans for you to be the full time caregiver for your sister when they are too old.\n\nYou are NEVER obligated to do that.

As much as possible I tried to make my other child's life as normal as possible.  \n\nIt can be tough for everyone, they might be overwhelmed. But, you need care and attention too.  \n\nThere are some books on this topic that might help if you can get your parents to read them; e.g. Being the Other One: Growing Up with a Brother or Sister Who Has Special Needs. \n\nOne way we managed it was for me to set aside special time just for my other child.  We would have regular times just for us, including something we called mother-daughter days where she would get to choose what we did.  \n\nHowever, if you can't convince them of this, you will need to set some boundaries for yourself.

Your parents are assholes, big ones at that.", "NTA\n\nThis is a very tricky situation, and let me first start by saying, I empathise with you wholeheartedly. My childhood was exactly the same, and reading this post was like a gut punch back into  the past. \n\nGrowing up my mother was a single mother raising 3 children under the age of 10, my older sister having severe special needs. It wasn't easy and as the next oldest child, I was expected to help my mum with her care. We couldn't go out or have guests back home, just in case I was needed, or if my sister had a meltdown. \n\nObviously you know your sisters behaviour way better than anyone else, but reading and seeing the behavioural similarities to my own sister- I strongly suspect your sister is autistic. \n\nIn the position you're in, I don't think your parents are ever going to see your side of this. Too much of their attention and time is on your sister. This isn't to say that you have to just sit down and take it though. She's not your child, and you shouldn't be expected to give up your life for hers. \n\nI think you should look into outreach programs in your area. I'm from the UK so I know that the process for these things is going to be different country to country. In the UK there's an amazing charity by the name of Barnardo's that ran a support group for siblings of children with special needs. This was a lifesaver for me growing up. Something like this could give you a much needed outlet for how you're feeling, and give advice on how to move forward with your parents. Even if it just allows you to be amongst kids with similar situations to you- I think it could be a real help.\n\nI sincerely hope your situation improves and that your parents see sense, or they'll end up losing you forever.", "NTA. Your parents are abusive and abhorrent.", "Are you allowed to do any extracurricular activities?", "My guy you are delusional, with no real grasp on life.
