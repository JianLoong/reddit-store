When I watched the Barbie movie with a few friends we dressed up so I already had a dress to wear so I didn't really have to buy anything.\n\nMy sister was fine with us going together and it was super fun we had good time.

It really sucks because we were kinda friends too but I guess at least there relationship is still fine because my sister is only pissed at me. She thinks I was trying to steal her bf so because her bf is straight she's not annoyed at him because he wouldn't be interested in me anyway which I guess is fair idk.\n\nShe told our parents for some reason and they said what I did was super wrong.\n\nI honestly don't get why she thinks I want her bf so bad.

Bizarre, totally bizarre all around", "I am so confused. He asked you, knowing you were gay. She said she was fine with it, knowing you were gay. But then it happens and you\u2019re at fault for\u2026.. existing while gay near the BF with approval by all parties for being there?\n\nNTA, 1000%. I can think of two reasons for this: BF did not clarify with your sister that inviting you meant you would be replacing her as Barbie. He is now taking her side (instead of admitting it was his mistake) to not lose the relationship. \n\nOR\n\nBF may not be as straight as he claims and let it slip to your sister how good of a time he had, so she is on the defensive. \n\nAll and all- everyone agreed ahead of time, but are angry after when you did nothing wrong.", "NTA Your sister is being ridiculous. She was fine with it, the boyfriend wanted you to come, and she only got mad because she saw pics of you having a great time instead of her having a great time. This is dumb. Ignore your parents and stand your ground. Your sister needs to cool off for a bit and maybe think about what the hell she got mad for. Once she's ready to talk maybe show her screen shots of the comments here showing how ridiculous and dumb we think she is. Geez \ud83d\ude44", "NTA I-N-F-O\n\n\n\nI'm not from USA so I might be totally off with my gut reaction, which is why I want info. My question is; what do matching costumes mean in your social setting?\n\n\nDo most Americans think that matching costumes are a sign of closeness (this is my partner / bff)? Or a sign of competition (we came together and we need to look incredible without outshining each other)? Or possibly a \"no one will recognise character A without B\" (like needing Barbie to make Ken obvious)? Or is it about repurposing existing costumes, and this was a coincidence?\n\n\nTo me in a *idgaf about Halloween* country, I would think matching couples costumes are a sign of romantic intent. Otherwise you'd wear matching not-couples costumes. Eg, go as Mario and Luigi instead of Mario and Peach. So I'm leaning towards y t a but I'll wait for a reply...\n\nEdit: based on OP reply, NTA. Socially you wanted your outfits to *make sense together* and you're right that the most recent version of pop culture doesn't link the two romantically. Sorry your sister has gone off the deep end, I hope you two can talk it out soon and go back to being friends \ud83d\ude42", "INFO: What were in the pictures on IG? Could you describe them?", "NTA.

I also guess there were many other Barbies at the party.\n\nAlso, unless her boyfriend is gay or bi I truly don't see why this is an issue because even if you found him attractive it's not like you could or would try to steal him...she sounds insecure", "NTA she must be very insecure if she thinks you in a Barbie costume is the key to his heart or .. other places. Sorry your parents backed her up. INFO Anyway to see this costume that has the power to turn straight men gay?  Edit word", "Nta", "**NTA** Your sister sounds deeply insecure.  *Perhaps* she has a suspicion that her boyfriend is gay and might act out on it. \nThere could be some homophobic undertones in her actions", "NTA- it is underlying insecurities that your sister has.

Either way- I personally have a gay brother and would never, ever mind him going to a party, dressing up w/ my boyfriend, etc. because I trust him...", "NTA - now you know your family merely tolerates you being gay and doesn\u2019t actually accept you.

Your sister is acting extremely insecure and selfish, but your parents should know better than to take her side on this one. I\u2019m sorry your family is treating you like this but you don\u2019t deserve that at all.

It would have been smart for her bf to have run the plan by her (I don\u2019t see this as your responsibility) but he probably didn\u2019t think it was a big deal bc all of their friends know he\u2019s straight & dating your sister. She was clearly jealous of the attention you got and there might be some internalized homophobia at play here. Sadly, this happens a lot; people can be completely unaware of it, consciously believing they accept queer people, yet having subconscious stigma that continue to affect how they interpret situations.  No matter what motivated it, having her bf block you is an absurd (and pointless) overreaction. It would be one thing if she came to you and said that made her feel uncomfortable and that she didn\u2019t appreciate that no one asked her how she felt about it, but she lost all credibility when she started the dramatics and accused you of trying to steal her man.", "NTA on the surface; ~~it sounds like you're the victim of some discriminating and anti-LGBT at the hands of your family but.~~... but it's pretty odd that they WERE fine with it, and then suddenly were not, so I guess I wonder what's missing here. It seems like something in the photos made her react, AND her BF also seems like he was uncomfortable with some aspect of this, and your parents as well, so was there a shift or were they just... leading you on / deluding themselves?\n\nIt's honestly so inexplicable that that's why I'm asking, but if there is nothing more to this, NTA and I'm sorry for the poor treatment you're experiencing.  \n\n\nEdit: ok, point taken - besides OP mentioning they don't want to get with every guy, homophobia is not necessarily in play her.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister gave the okay for you two to go together. If you had gone to this party without her knowledge, YWBTA, but she knew all about this and then was angry after the fact. Definitely not your fault!\n\nI imagine there is some stereotyping going on here. Gay men have been stereotyped as oversexed, voracious people who want to have sex with all men. It really aligns with the conservative view that gay men are going to steal your straight husband and ruin your life. It\u2019s a shitty perspective that isn\u2019t accurate, but I wonder if your parents and sister hold these beliefs.", "NTA What did she expect him to do with just a Ken costume and two days notice?", "NTA.\nIt seems like her bf had a good time, and it should\u2019ve been a simple convo between you and your sister if she felt uncomfortable.

Your sister has major insecurities.", "This is an ESH. You can go to the party with her boyfriend. But not in a couples costume. If she did go they would have been in a couples costume because that\u2019s what they are. It\u2019s a bit like the unwritten rule of dating your siblings ex. You can be friendly, but you can\u2019t be friends or date. It\u2019s partially jealousy, but it\u2019s also the, I don\u2019t want to share everything with my sibling thing.

My understanding is your sister knew you were going to the party with her bf but not that you were going to dress as if you two were a couple. Is that correct?\n\nIf that\u2019s the case then I do think this is YTA. Did everyone at the party know your sister and her bf were dating? Were these all friends? Or was this a bigger party where it\u2019s possible people would see a matching costume and people having a good time together and believe you two were dating? \n\nIf my sibling\u2019s partner had invited me to a Halloween party it would never cross my mind to dress up as a couple, regardless of everyone\u2019s orientation. Was going as Barbie meant to be a joke? \n\nThere were many ways to match his costume without going the couple route. \n\nI don\u2019t know if the degree of your sister\u2019s anger is justified - Internet strangers can\u2019t tell if you have a history of \u201cjokingly\u201d flirting with her boyfriends or if she\u2019s blowing things out of proportion or deflecting insecurities - but I do think the choice you made wasn\u2019t the best.", "Info: were you hanging all over the bf in the photos?", "NTA but her boyfriend totally has a crush on you why you of all people would he asked to be Barbie that's so weird I find it odd he's trying to do a couple costume with his girlfriend's brother that wouldn't be cool if it if you were a girl", "Tiny YTA. If you went to the trouble to putting on a costume and going to the party WITH her boyfriend, you should have at least checked with your sister about whether she was cool with you dressing up as a couple with her boyfriend. \n\nI also think she over reacted, but I understand why she was upset.

It's one thing to go with him to a party and a very different thing to go in the character your sister was planning to be.", "NTA. You definitely looked better than what she'd look like and that pissed her off. Bf is most likely just saving his head by throwing you under the bus. I'd really like to know how she'll even answer on why she freaked like that eventho her bf is supposedly straighter than a log. She's full on acting like you tryna steal her straight like a steel bar man from her or tried to act like he yours at the party. I hope all ends well with you tho! Don't let her toxic craziness mess with you.", "NTA. She's jealous that you looked better than she would have and that you two had such a good time. She and your family are homophobic and being really shitty. And her boyfriend is a coward. You didn't do anything wrong at all.", "I wanna see your costume.", "NTA, your fam is def homophobic though", "NTA, couples costumes aren\u2019t exclusively for couples. I do matching costumes with friends all the time.", "NTA. your sister obviously not knowing how sexuality works isnt your problem. if she thinks you, a gay man, has a chance getting with her boyfriend, a straight man, then she obviously has no idea how sexuality works and thats her own problem for being so jealous she  thinks youre tryna get with him", "NTA, so your sister was okay with you going to the party with her bf up until she saw photos of you two on ig. Sounds like irrational jealousy.", "Maybe her bf likes getting pegged but is still heterosexual. Nta", "100% NTA", "It wouldn't even matter if you were. Unless she has doubts about dude. NTA", "Bruh I was imagining someone's sister but you being the brother dressed as barbie is way funnier to me. Your sister has issues. Tell her that you aren't trying to steal her man and thought it would be funny. Don't apologize. NTA", "Kinda weird that a 21yo was comfortable taking a 15yo to a Halloween party, regardless of gender.", "This seems like a total early twenties thing. Your GF isn't mature enough to understand that you going in a couples costume with her brother isn't a threat to their relationship. It's total teen soap opera drama.\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "NTA, but also I can also understand why your sister is upset. If this were a group costume, it'd be different, but having your sibling do a couple costume with your SO does feel a bit odd. I wouldn't be surprised if she wasn't upset initially but the Instagram post prompted weird comments that put her in an awkward spot. I am curious to see what the responses would look like if you were a cishet woman doing this with her boyfriend.", "*hypothetically", "Not bizarre, the sister is very insecure. OP you are NTA. Your sister and parents for siding with her.", "he asked op to go to the party it seems... op decided he would steal his sisters costume and go as barbie from the sound of it.", "Her insecurities have hit a new high for me", "pretty sure it was her bf who wanted to do it,", "I understand that thank you sm", "yeah literally", "Did you reply to the wrong post? Or just not read this one? How is the gay dude in the wrong for his psycho sister's reactions?", "fr lol", "thank you", "no I didn't but I assumed he would've told her because it wasn't a secret or anything", "what? \ud83d\ude2d", "did the bf ask you to complete the couples costume with him? did he invite you specifically to be barbie? or did you just take it upon yourself to complete the costume/", "> I had my head on his shoulder and he was kinda holding me up with my shoulder\n\nYes, I can understand why your sister was upset. That goes beyond just 'friends'.  YTA", "There may be no rule, but siblings have these unwritten rules that you are supposed to somehow know. Most of the time you find out through friends who have siblings, or when you screw up and break the rule you didn\u2019t know existed. Just from my own experience with my sister. So many rules. Ugh", "I\u2019m assuming this was a party with mostly 21ish-aged people? And alcohol? Not saying there was ANYTHING weird going on between you and sister\u2019s bf, but as the 21yo I wouldn\u2019t want to bring a 15yo to a party with my friends.", "OH WOW I totally misread your original post! You came out at 15, you\u2019re not 15 now \ud83d\ude02 sorry OP!! My mistake", "i think it was the fact her boyfriend and brother did a couple costume.", "he asked if I would be Barbie because like you can't have ken without barbie I guess", "He was drunk... He stated in the post that he literally couldn't stand. Are you blind?", "I get that but I did explain to her that he was only doing it because I was drunk at lol", "haha it's alright", "I would remind her that there are a lot of Barbies in the Barbie world and you were not trying to be a couple with him. You were just trying to fit the group theme. So you weren\u2019t \u201chis Barbie\u201d you were someone else\u2019s Barbie.", "That's probably the issue. Alcohol is great at leading to bad decisions so while you have no interest in her boyfriend, after a few drinks something could happen that forces him to be uncomfortable, and that's probably what she's concerned with, not you actually stealing her bf but creating an uncomfortable situation where now he doesn't want to be around your family.", "Ding ding ding!!! Now we get a real reason. NTA OP...but I can now see why your Sister is upset.\nDoesn't matter what your attracted to...you should not be hanging/ hugging/ cuddling with the boyfriend. YTA for those actions only. OP you brought this on yourself.", "and info is needed as to whose idea that was cause to me its reading like bf invited him to the party and op decided \"i'll complete the couples costume and go as barbie!\" which is super fucking weird for any sibling to do with their siblings SO.... regardless of gender or sexuality. \n\ncouples costumes are for couples...", "that's not what you said in your post. \n\n>I'm assuming he asked me because he wanted to go with someone who would go as Barbie \n\nwhy you lying now?", "Also totally NTA for the record \ud83d\udc4d", "But bf said he only blocked him because sister made him. Doesn\u2019t sound like he was uncomfortable at all.", "This is satire, right?", "I guess some people's relationships are really that fragile", "Hand around someone = hugging and cuddling someone? Are you 12?", "alright I get that I just don't think a touching like that is a big deal idk I guess it is for some people", "And if it's a Barbie movie cosplay, the characters aren't even a couple, in fact that's a pretty major point of the movie, so...\n\nPeople dress up in matching/pair costumes without dating all the time lmao. Regardless OP pretty clearly said in the post the sister's bf asked him, OP didn't suggest it.", "sorry I don't get what you mean?\n\nHe asked me to go with him and then after I said yes asked if I would go as barbie. I haven't lied about that at any point lol", "thank you!", "Correct. I'm not saying the BF was uncomfortable, I'm saying it's possible the sister was worried about that happening.", ">so he asked me to go with him.\n\n>I'm assuming he asked me because he wanted to go with someone who would go as Barbie\n\nall the boyfriend did was invite him to the party... OP ***assumed*** that he wanted him to go as barbie and says so right in the post you refferenced but the boyfriend never asked him to as stated in the post.... \n\nyou should work on your reading comprehension if you're gonna make such idiotic comments.", "? Did you tell her it was her BF's idea to have you come as Barbie so his outfit made sense? \n\nNTA regardless", "Sounds gay", "Friendly reminder to your sister that the driving issue in the movie was that Barbie had zero interest in Ken! So really, you going as Barbie is more appropriate than her going as Barbie. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Also NTA lol your sister is being ridiculous.", "NTA. You\u2019re gay, so it wasn\u2019t like that. Something tells me that she doesn\u2019t take your gayness seriously. This happens a lot with women who love women.", "Hm. Normally with same-sex I'd say it's no big deal and obviously meant to be a joke costume for friends. But if you are gay then that does change context a bit--it could be perceived as you trying to get with your sister's bf since it is a \"couple\" costume.\n\nNAH but she is for sure overreacting since you explained you didn't mean it that way.", "Super annoying when someone thinks a gay guy will automatically be interested in another guy simply because he has a penis. \n\nNTA\n\nSister, though? Hmm. Maybe ask her what she thought you were supposed to be doing or what she thought you would be doing at the party. Sounds like you were just\u2026enjoying being at a party. Is that not what was supposed to happen?", "What in the world? She knew what you were doing, and she knows her BF is straight, so... what is she babbling about? It sounds like good clean fun, and she needs to work on the baseless jealousy. NTA", "After reading your responses, it's clear that she's just being difficult. All I see is that you are literally thanking people who are saying YTA for their perspective. She should know that it wasn't malicious, and her reaction is insane to me. She could have said, \"Hey. It made me really uncomfortable that you did that.\" What would you have said to that?\n\nPeople are flawed and allowed to make mistakes, and if she wanted an apology or an acknowledgment that this isn't something she's okay with, she can say that and move forward. This could have just been a conversation. I don't personally see anything wrong with what you did. \n\nNTA by literally any means. She is an insecure child. Her blocking you points to there being an underlying issue here.", "NTA, seems like a great costume. Nicely done, Barbie.", "Such drama just for combined costumes? It's just like a cosplay duo. NTA", "ETAH.  Who goes out with their sister's boyfriend in a couples Halloween costume?  That's some really weird shit to be pulling.  The boyfriend should have had enough sense to not keep the costume going if she didn't want to dress up or at least ask if she minded if he replaced her with her family members.  The sister obviously wouldn't love the humiliation of seeing this plastered all over social media but nuking the \"friendship\" (side eye) isn't going to change what's already done.  All of you need to get some communication skills.", "NTA\nYour sister is probably mad because you guys had fun and she wasn\u2019t there to have fun. She needs to grow up and apologize to you for accusing you.", "NTA- See this was the most heartwarming modern story, you and the maybe one day father of your niblings hanging out together, him stoked that you came in drag as Barbie so he could do the matching costume he wanted to do, having a great night together, no one getting ignorant remarks over their costume, and building a friendship, all wholesome as you could possibly get and surely source of a photo that would be legendary in your family for generations to come if they stayed together... then your sister goes all 'worst and weirdest conclusion'. I mean is it her transferring her guilt for not only ditching but not bothering to ask him if he was still going to do the costume etc.?", "Technically OP mentioned they went as movie Barbie and Ken which are not even together", "They're making it a big deal when it's really not", "Maybe people who saw the post started making comments at her that upset her and she took it out on you", "what is your deal lmao. you\u2019re so convinced brother is actually trying to steal the boyfriend. are you the sister?", "To be fair, we had a themed costume party for my husband's 30th. He was Mario with his best friend as Luigi, but I was Disney based. We wanted to choose characters we liked and turns out our pop culture references really don't overlap much! lol", "I don't think he was trying to steal the boyfriend... I just think he's weird for thinking he should complete his siblings partner's couples costume... only because I also have siblings and can not fathom a universe where I think that is 1) a good idea or 2) appropriate. \n\nyou live your best life... try to come up with an actual argument instead of the lamest comeback on this sub.", "you literally accused op of lying when he replied confused as to what you were talking about. the sister sounds insecure, and the brother is confused bc he was just going for a good time, not to cause any issues or make his sister jealous or anything else. boyfriend specifically asked op to be barbie after op agreed to go with. maybe they should have mentioned it to her, but clearly neither of them thought it was a big deal, and didn\u2019t think they had to run it past her. that would have saved a lot of stress for everyone involved, but bffr sister is acting controlling and insecure. i also have siblings, and if i were the sister in this case, i would not have acted like this. i would have just been glad they had a good time? i trust my boyfriend and i trust all of my sisters.", "Okay but look at it this way if you were a straight woman literally everyone would be calling you the a****** because that's just weird to do with the person that you're not in a relationship with", "That quote can just as easily mean, \"I assumed he asked me to go because I was willing to go as Barbie and others wouldn\u2019t/might not be,\" and it sounds like that's the case.", "Are you his sister? Calm down \ud83d\ude05", "But then, why make him block OP? If she's worried about him being uncomfortable and he's not uncomfortable, then it's not necessary.", "just saying, i took this to mean the brother was asked because the boyfriend knew he would be down to dress like barbie. boyfriend probably felt weird going as ken without a barbie. and as a commenter said above, there\u2019s more than one barbie, and it seems to me like the brother wasn\u2019t trying to be *barbie* just *a* barbie.", "Why are you asking me that when the sister is the one who did it? Go talk to her. You're asking silly questions and not comprehending the statements being made.", "just saying that you also assumed the same thing as OP doesn't make the two of you right. \n\nif he never said to dress as barbie its a really weird logical leap to do that without confirming it....\n\n\n> boyfriend probably felt weird going as ken without a barbie.\n\nthis is you litterally fabricating a narrative that fits your argument instead of letting the facts speak for themselves", "It's hypothetical. My point was that what you're saying doesn't make sense from the perspective of her being concerned with her boyfriend's comfort.", "dude. op literally said that the brother asked him to be barbie. you\u2019re so defensive and for what? you\u2019re literally doubling down and repeating yourself when it\u2019s been clarified that the brother asked him to be barbie. my assumption is just that the reason the boyfriend asked that specifically is bc he would have felt awkward going as ken without a barbie. the op is assuming that the reason he *specifically* was asked was bc the boyfriend didn\u2019t know anyone else that would go as barbie. i\u2019m sure boyfriend knows girls, and that they would have, but maybe he figured a guy going as barbie would be less problematic. we don\u2019t know everything so we need to use our noggins and read context clues."]}
