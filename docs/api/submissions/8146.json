My sister (31f) and her husband (31m) have two sons, Callan, who is thirteen and Vincent, who is ten. \n\nMy sister and her husband are both great parents and try the best to teach their kids empathy and responsibility, so far Callan is a kind young man, he still makes mistakes and dumb decisions, but a good boy. Unfortunately, Vincent is not, he\u2019s been a bully since kindergarten and is only getting worse. He just started seeing a therapist, his parents have tried all forms of punishment and teaching without hurting him (no hitting or yelling) but nothing seems to work. They\u2019ve tried taking away his phone, having conversations, ect.\n\nAbout a year ago, Callan was introduced to a new friend through one of his friends, the new friend is transgender, Callan and his other friends have all become really close to this boy, they bond over sports. This boy also has been to some local events for LGBT youth and has a few trans friends, one of them being a girl who we\u2019ll call Rose. One day, Callan and his friends were introduced to Rose. Callan instantly had a crush and asked her out shortly after meeting her, 6 months later and they\u2019re officially dating. Callan has dated a few girls in the past, all were cisgender. This is his longest relationship so far.\n\nMy sister and her her husband have done everything they can to try to make Rose feel comfortable, they just want Callan to be happy. When it came to making the guest list, each invite, including the children, had a plus one. Callan wants to bring Rose. \n\nA few weeks ago, Rose started receiving mean messages from an anonymous account on Instagram, this was happening for a few days, when Rose told Callan about it, he asked to see the messages and noticed it was similar to how his brother types. He told his parents about it, they took Vincent\u2019s phone and saw that he was the one sending the messages. He\u2019s now banned from the phone permanently and has been given a flip phone.\n\nAfter my sister told me about this, my fianc\u00e9 and I talked and agreed we didn\u2019t want Vincent at our wedding unless he showcased improvements in behavior, we talked to my sister and her husband and agreed we\u2019d make a contract for Vincent to approve on his behavior, and have since made a contract on how he will behave in the next few months, and how he will behave at my wedding with consequences in place if he violated rules. \n\nOur parents are not happy about this, when they heard about it they said that Vincent is family and stuff about \u201cblood is thicker than water\u201d and suggested we should just buy Rose jewelry and makeup to make up for what happened. They said that excluding Vincent from the wedding would be unfair and it could hurt his relationship with the cousins that like him (I have other siblings who have kids).

The punishment they implemented (flip phone instead of smart phone) along with explaining what the kid did wrong is a totally reasonable way to react to this. This child is not even in middle school.
