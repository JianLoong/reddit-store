My sister (31f) and her husband (31m) have two sons, Callan, who is thirteen and Vincent, who is ten. \n\nMy sister and her husband are both great parents and try the best to teach their kids empathy and responsibility, so far Callan is a kind young man, he still makes mistakes and dumb decisions, but a good boy. Unfortunately, Vincent is not, he\u2019s been a bully since kindergarten and is only getting worse. He just started seeing a therapist, his parents have tried all forms of punishment and teaching without hurting him (no hitting or yelling) but nothing seems to work. They\u2019ve tried taking away his phone, having conversations, ect.\n\nAbout a year ago, Callan was introduced to a new friend through one of his friends, the new friend is transgender, Callan and his other friends have all become really close to this boy, they bond over sports. This boy also has been to some local events for LGBT youth and has a few trans friends, one of them being a girl who we\u2019ll call Rose. One day, Callan and his friends were introduced to Rose. Callan instantly had a crush and asked her out shortly after meeting her, 6 months later and they\u2019re officially dating. Callan has dated a few girls in the past, all were cisgender. This is his longest relationship so far.\n\nMy sister and her her husband have done everything they can to try to make Rose feel comfortable, they just want Callan to be happy. When it came to making the guest list, each invite, including the children, had a plus one. Callan wants to bring Rose. \n\nA few weeks ago, Rose started receiving mean messages from an anonymous account on Instagram, this was happening for a few days, when Rose told Callan about it, he asked to see the messages and noticed it was similar to how his brother types. He told his parents about it, they took Vincent\u2019s phone and saw that he was the one sending the messages. He\u2019s now banned from the phone permanently and has been given a flip phone.\n\nAfter my sister told me about this, my fianc\u00e9 and I talked and agreed we didn\u2019t want Vincent at our wedding unless he showcased improvements in behavior, we talked to my sister and her husband and agreed we\u2019d make a contract for Vincent to approve on his behavior, and have since made a contract on how he will behave in the next few months, and how he will behave at my wedding with consequences in place if he violated rules. \n\nOur parents are not happy about this, when they heard about it they said that Vincent is family and stuff about \u201cblood is thicker than water\u201d and suggested we should just buy Rose jewelry and makeup to make up for what happened. They said that excluding Vincent from the wedding would be unfair and it could hurt his relationship with the cousins that like him (I have other siblings who have kids).

The punishment they implemented (flip phone instead of smart phone) along with explaining what the kid did wrong is a totally reasonable way to react to this. This child is not even in middle school.

The grandparents need to step way back & zip their lips.\n\nAlso, your sister & BIL should be talking to Vincent's pediatrician & get some testing done - his behavior is way out of line for a 10 year old.  The way he's acting reminds me a lot of a young relative of mine who was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  Her parents got her on medication & into counseling & it really helped.", "NTA\n\n1. Its your wedding\n2. You're working directly and in step with the child's parents \n3.

The actual quote is \"the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\". It means the family you choose is stronger than the family you're born with.

Do you really even want him there?\n\nNTA, you're trying to help your sister.", "INFO: Hol'up! a 12-13 year old is dating?! Clearly yer sister is raising her kids wrong. When I was that age I was so full of awkwardness I couldn't have normal conversations with anybody, let alone someone I was interested in. Also, who gives their 10-13 yo kids a phone? They don't need one, and shouldn't be trusted to use one until they start driving.", "I would never allow that LB in the door. NTA!", "NTA... Your parents are right, \"The blood of the covenant IS thicker than the water of the womb\". I don't think they meant it this way as most people don't know the full quote and misuse it constantly.

You shouldn't need to have to draw up a contract.", "Wow, your parents are a piece of work. You are NTA whatsoever. But your parents and Vincent are.\n\nFirstly, you're nicer than I am to let him come at all, I would've booted him and told him to learn to be better or he'll keep losing out in life.\n\nSecond, \"blood is thicker than water\" comes from \"the blood of the covenant is thicker than then water of the womb\" meaning the relationships we forge in life are stronger than family ties, so your parents need to pick a new saying.\n\nThem wanting to sweep the incident aside with a few gifts is also super misogynistic and the type of scummy tactic you see from inappropriate CEOs and company execs who \"make a mistake\" by harassing female employees.\n\nFinally, what evidence do you have that Vincent will follow through? He may pretend to change but then act up at your wedding to \"punish you\" for this. And you've said before that other consequences have not worked, how do you know the ones in place with the contract will?

You guys need to hold firm to try and make some much needed changes in this young man for him and for other people he my meet that are different from him.

An asshole would have let things escalate and _then_ make everyone feel bad by saying _I told you_. \n\nWe don't have to tolerate such behauviour in wedding, and as I've noticed some grumpy mid-life crisis signals in me, this asshole would definitely be upset as a guest about some teen kiddo would cause a chaos and no-one would do anything, because you know, he's still a kid. \n\nWhat could be _more_ polite and diplomatic way to prevent that chaos, even if the chance to that chaos was minimal?

Your wedding is a supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life and this little puke will purposely try to ruin it. Besides, he needs to learn there are consequences for his terrible/cruel/selfish behavior. I have a sibling who I no longer have any contact with who acted very much the same. She absolutely had to ruin EVERY SINGLE holiday, birthday, wedding, event that happened in our or anyone else's lives around her. It was a power trip for her and she couldn't stand not being the center attention even if it was negative attention. She would even improve her behavior so she would get invited then once she showed up she went absolutely apeshit to ruin things. My parents were way to lenient with her so the behavior continues to this day, hence my siblings and I have zero contact with her. Dont allow yourself to be guilt tripped into letting this brat destroy your happiness. The fact you haven't banned him outright from attending is kind enough. However, I wouldn't even risk it. He needs to learn actions have consequences because ultimately it may end up getting through to him and helping him realize he needs to change his behavior.", "NTA nip that bigotry in the bud.

Sounds like the PARENTS are actually TRYING to their job in this case, and the grandparents are being too soft. I would love to know if they were the types to go \"wait until YOU have kids one day!\" back when Vincent's parents were youngsters, because that would totally fit.\n\nSheesh, consigned to a flip phone. That's the ultimate social punishment for kids today? :P", "NTA\n\nBtw, \"Blood is thicker than a water\" is bs.\n\nOriginal actually goes: \"The blood of the convenent is thicker than a water of the womb\"", "NTA, this was an arrangement that you and his parents agreed on (whether he'll actually adhere to it is another thing).

The way we got dates to dances and whatnot throughout middle school was by getting friends to tell the person you liked them, and then maybe you\u2019d hold hands at lunch or have your parents bring you to a movie date or something\n\nA 13 year old bringing a plus one to a wedding is pretty funny actually lol", "my son has behavior issues as well, and laying out expectations is something that does help him. He knows what to expect, as changes of any kind are not good for him. Routine is key. and part of routines are knowing what will happen of X happens.", "Same. In our contracts we also had to fill out what we, the staff, did to try to deescalate the behavior or help the situation- as well as the immediate outcome of the behavior. We also had to track what was happening at the moment of the behavior so we could track where things get out of hand.\n\nThis helped a lot when having conversations with the kids and their parents about what we can do to better the situation and the kids or their parents would try to make claims that weren\u2019t accurate.", "Back in the 80s when I was that age, I also went on dates. My parents were fine with me having dates to the movies, the library, the park, the local pizza place, doing homework together. Mind you these were fairly chaste events that involved hand holding and so forth. It was about spending time with someone I liked. So this doesn't seem like some horrifying development to me, just two kids beginning to explore that aspect of their lives. Which is kinda what being a teenager is all about.\n\nAllowing a kid to teenager to bring a plus one is a lovely gesture. It doesn't have to be a bf/gf. It could just be a friend so they can enjoy the event together. Having been to weddings when I was a teenager and a kid, they can be exceedingly boring and having a friend would have been great. In this case, it is a gf. Honestly, it'll probably be a nice memorable experience for them.  \n\n\nAs for the contract, as others have commented-contracts with a kid with behavioral problems can be useful. Plenty of teachers use them with students to help them understand expectations and consequences. If the contract doesn't help, the solution is clear-the kid stays at home. If the contract does help, then not only can the kid attend but the parents have learned a way to help their son regulate his behavior.", "Still a popular Reddit myth, but one of the few that gets called out, quite an improvement from a couple of years ago.", "I mean, I think the key problem in your case was that if you broke the contract you got yelled at which is neither effective nor healthy. Behavior contracts can be helpful because they set clear expectations, but \u201cbreaking\u201d the contract shouldn\u2019t be seen as a failure or something to get angry or upset about. It just means that the kid needs more tools or practice to help them be able to meet those expectations next time.", "So kids can be kids as long as they're straight?", "Do you think kids can't be LGBTQ+? This is such outdated thinking...", "I\u2019m a lesbian and had a girlfriend at 13\ud83d\ude2d It\u2019s not the LGBT community\u2019s fault that you were single back then???", "Damn I was with you until the why can\u2019t  kids just be kids bit man. don\u2019t be a jerk", "I stand corrected. But then again, I wouldn't be surprised if blood of the covenant was suppressed, it's a more logical conspiracy theory than Pizzagate anyways, plenty of cultures built on controlling the following generations of family.", "I got my first phone for my 10th birthday. I think 10 is a good age as kids that age are about to enter late elementary/early middle school and starting to gain a growing sense of independence. That's also an age where they can for the most part differentiate right and wrong. For me at least, going double digits was a big deal. I saw it as an age milestone, similar to 13 or 18.", "I was 9 when I started walking to school and from school by myself, and my parents gave me a flip phone (smartphones only came out a few years later) for safety purposes.", "Haven\u2019t YOU been in a loving relationship since the age of 12???

One of my nephews couldn't be in the room with his dying great-grandmother because she looked so different from his memory.  My daughter was terrified of all Santas for 2 years.  We have a pretty diverse friend group, and my son was not equipped to meet a friend who definitely cross dresses and was in a very waifu cosplay at a convention.  He wasn't rude or hateful, but he was definitely confused why V was in a dress and battle thong. \n\nI could see the 10 year old being very confused by the situation, but the rest seems a bit far fetched. Could be completely wrong, but I think this is mostly outrage farming", "I mean 13yrs old is 8th grade, I definitely knew people who had boyfriends/girlfriends in 6th grade and at that age relationships are usually really short so he could have had quite a few girlfriends by 13. And longest relationship yet could mean it\u2019s been like a month or two, which at that age is pretty long", "I mean, I don't think a transphobic 10yo is that much of a stretch. If I remember right that's about the age that some bullying turns overtly homophobic. My first girlfriend in high school as an 11yo brother who was pretty homophobic. Yelling homophobic insults at people when online gaming for one but also refusing to speak to me (because I was queer) and also only referring to me as Phil when I wasn't around because I guess I was 'super butch and basically a man'\n\nThis kid online bullying his brothers girlfriend is not a shock. They already know he's a bully", "that section sounded so weird. This whole family is on another planet", "I have kids right around these ages and they\u2019re not allowed to date, they know the rules and we\u2019ve had discussions as to when etc. But my elementary aged kid has friends who have been dating - some of them for a couple years. They have a friend who just broke up with one and started dating another and their respective parents get together and allow the kids to hang out - what the kids then call \u201cdates\u201d. I\u2019m shocked by it all but I think it\u2019s probably more common then most realize. A lot of their friends have social media. I regularly check to make sure no accounts exist and have restricted access to certain apps and websites. Some of these kids are posting on tiktok as well. It\u2019s just bizarre times right now.", "Well it is his longest relationship so far which in 13 year old world means like 2 weeks", "Plus the 13 year old noticed that the mean messages were similar to \u201chow his brother types\u201d? Does the kid always double space or something?", "Back in my peak playground days I was a ruthless divorce attorney. The teachers banned diborce court because things got heated", "the relationship isn\u2019t 6 months, he met her 6months before they started dating.

Op is getting married at 25 (fianc\u00e9 23.) They start early.", "Could be referring to grammar or word choice.

At least 6 months have passed with Rose in the picture. Where exactly do 12 year olds go on dates?

There's not enough to know either way.  It just seems odd for a 13 year old to have a relationship history with 4 partners serious enough for the aunt to know about with both sexes represented, even if only one gender."]}
