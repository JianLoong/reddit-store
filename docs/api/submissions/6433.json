I proceeded to do so and went back to bed as I felt so lethargic. \n\nHe woke me up with soup and put a bucket beside me, whilst continuously changing my room temperature as one minute I was cold and the next hot.

I am guessing you live alone? It's horrible to feel sick and be alone.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, she has issues she needs to work through. Hope you are feeling better!", "He stepped in where your sister should have. He seems to be a good person. Some people are just naturally caring. Your sister needs to stop acting ridiculous. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. If your sister didn't want someone else taking care of you, she could have done it herself.", "NTA\u2026 I do find that to be odd behavior on the BF\u2019s part, but it\u2019s not your fault.  This is a conversation she needs to be having with him.", "NTA. It sounds like her boyfriend really cares for you since he is going above and beyond. It sounds like he has feelings for you, but that\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s not like you were trying to seduce him or even inviting him over. He wanted to take care of you. Had anyone else come and done these things for you, such as your sister, you\u2019d be in a position to not accept his help if you felt it was inappropriate. It does seem inappropriate on his part and your sister really needs to talk to him about it. She\u2019s probably jealous that he thinks about you so much and didn\u2019t tell her the extent of his caring for you. But if I was a sick as you were I\u2019d probably be expecting him to not be there when I wake up, or do anything that he did, but if you\u2019re that sick you\u2019re not going to be up for talking to either of them about this weird dynamic in their relationship. They need to figure it out. If I was your sister I\u2019d definitely dump him since he has strong feelings for someone else and wasn\u2019t honest about the time he was spending with a person he\u2019s interested in, regardless of who it is. The fact that it\u2019s her sister just makes it hurt worse.", "NTA.  Boyfriend is a little suspicious but not really enough information to judge.\n\nHope you feel better soon!", "NTA - she should be happy he is that kind to you - because he might be more kind to your sister.", "NTA. He sounds lovely. She sounds kinda shitty.", "nta. she shouldn't have told her bf then. She can't get upset with you, you did nothing wrong. Only thing would be for her to tell her bf to stop if she feels uncomfortable with it.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ask for that level of help\u2014he offered. If this is really out of character for him, then it's your sister who needs to talk to him rather than be upset with you.", "NTA. Seems like your sister needs to get a grip. He was just being a decent human being. There were no advances on either sides, so I dont see anything wrong than a crazy older sister.", "Info: does her bf not care for her the same way when she\u2019s sick? \n\nIf he does then your sister is just being jealous then I would say N-T-A. But I would also say it is a little odd her bf drove over to you and did so much for you. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t care for her in the same way when she\u2019s sick like he cared for you then she may have a point. \n\nI feel like we need a bit more info here to make a judgement call.", "NTA \n\nYou were sick. This really has nothing to do with you. She\u2019s either insecure and jealous for no reason or he\u2019s given her reason to be so. Either way you did nothing.", "NTA. Where was your sister during all this? How come her boyfriend seemed more concerned about your health than your own sister? Your sister is definitely the asshole in this situation.", "NTA. She sent her boyfriend to help, and now she's mad that he helped? Make it make sense.", "NAH. \n\nBut I think what your sister means is she is uncomfortable with that level of intimacy and she'd rather you not part-take in it, even if you might think it's silly I feel like it would be nice to respect that boundary.\n\nOf course, I think it makes more sense for her to discuss with her bf instead of you, but I don't think she was trying to be malicious.", "You were sick and miserable and he was kind. That was simple compassion and she needs to get over herself. NTA Glad you're feeling better.", "NTA. Tell her to stop projecting her insecurities onto you.", "NTA - no good deed goes unpunished", "NTA. My question is, why didn\u2019t your sister come take care of you?", "I believe she has a right to be upset with him, not so much you.  He did what an actual boyfriend would do for a girlfriend he cares about.  Something he has obviously NOT done for your sister.  And he did this for 3 days, and likely never told your sister where he was spending his time.  I would send him a kind thank you note and then avoid him like the plague.  Your sister is going to have to deal with how she feels about it while you reassure her that you were far too ill to care who was holding your hair back or flirt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like he was just being helpful. I can understand that it seems that he was really going out of his way to be helpful but from what I can tell he was just trying to help", "NTA. She knew he was helping, so did your sister ask him to come check on you/help you? I just don't really understand if she *knew* he was helping, what was she expecting? It doesn't sound like he did anything inappropriate. Sounds more like he was caring for you as he would his own sibling.", "Nta, she didn\u2019t do anything to help you in your time of need and doesn\u2019t deserve this guy who genuinely wanted to help. But also you should stay away from him for a long time because you don\u2019t want to make this situation worse", "Nta. Sorry but your sister may be a psycho", "Call me the bad guy but this is a difficult AITA. Are you attracted to her boyfriend? keep it real. Sounds like he is 80% the kind person and 20% interested in both you and your sister.suspicions are probably valid. Until further info is added keeping it real I am uncertain.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your sister is taking her anger for her feeling for her bf on you than him. \nI would try to give her her space and let them figure it out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister is pinning on you what she suspects of her boyfriend; if anything, he's the one being weird but if she blames you, she doesn't have to confront how he's behaving. I'm sorry she's being like this to you.", "Oof sounds like norovirus or food poisoning or something and that\u2019s just BRUTAL either way. I hope you\u2019re feeling better now! NTA, your sister\u2019s bf is a saint and I hope she realises it.", "oip=NTA\n\nShe sent him over and now she's throwing  a hissy fit.  You were sick, you were puking.  Does she think her boyfriend has a Vomit Kink?\n\nI'd thank her boyfriend now that you are better and just let the distance sit until she gets over herself. Don't apologize, don't feel guilty, she made her choice and so did he.  All you did was try to \"survive\" your illness.", "...I'm suspicious of the bf and his intentions, especially if this isn't normal behavior for him. Has he never done this for OP's sister before?", "you have nothing to apologize for, she should be kissing her man's feet that he's such a wonderful, shining example of what a loving partner should be, that he would help her sister in a time of need.\n\nJudgement:  \nOP: NTA  \nsister: ITA, blatantly so at that, with flames even.", "does she want you and her boyfriend to despise each other? nta", "YTA.... so is he though. You should have asked him if she knew he was taking care of you. Maybe texted her to ask if maybe she sent him there. While it seems like a very kind gesture you don't know that he isn't working an angel to get the door opened for flirting. I say this because if HE did not tell your sister that he was coming to help you out, that means he has something to hide, and that is bad news. Next thing you know you'll be asking if you ATAH for making out with your sister's boyfriend behind her back, and no one wants that.  I would apologize to her if I were you and let him know that he should also apologize.", "Agree totally NTA.", "NTA. Her sister\u2019s BF is giving her all this help and her sister doesn\u2019t know about any of it? That is really weird and a red flag.", "Even if the bf doesn't care for the sister the same way he did for her, i still wouldn't say she's the asshole. She didn't ask for the help, he offered, was she just supposed to say \"oh no, don't worry, just let me choke on vomit and die\" or something? Eithzr the sister is jealous for no reason or she has an issue to talk to the bf about but that's it", "Yeah wondering if the sister felt weird about it because he doesn\u2019t do that for her when she\u2019s sick? My bf wouldn\u2019t do that for my sister.", "> My sister knew that he was helping me but didn\u2019t know to its fullest extent\n\nDude, learn to read. Sister knew her bf was taking care of OP. OP was busy vomiting and feeling miserable. It wasn't her job to make sure sister's bf wasn't being TOO helpful. If sister has an issue with the situation, that's a discussion she needs to have with her bf, not with her still-ailing sister. NTA.", "Yeah I guess true you\u2019re not going to turn down help but if I was the sister I\u2019d be a little weirded out. Not saying she\u2019s the AH just that it seems odd.", "She did say it \"wasn't in his nature,\" which does make me think that he doesn't do it for her, which does take this from sweet behavior to questionable. Why be this doting on the sister but not also the girlfriend? Assuming that is what the sister meant by that. But of course even if he is being weird that's still not OP's fault.", "i mean yeah but this is the same person who instead of checking on her sister just told her boyfriend my sister is sick and hadnt stopped by to see her until 2 days later. just spitballing maybe he doesn\u2019t do it for her because she doesnt put that effort for anyone else", "True the question is am I the asshole, which she\u2019s not but being that sister I would\u2019ve felt awkward having my sisters bf pay that much attention to me."]}
