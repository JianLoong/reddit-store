It sounds like he has feelings for you, but that\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s not like you were trying to seduce him or even inviting him over. He wanted to take care of you. Had anyone else come and done these things for you, such as your sister, you\u2019d be in a position to not accept his help if you felt it was inappropriate. It does seem inappropriate on his part and your sister really needs to talk to him about it. She\u2019s probably jealous that he thinks about you so much and didn\u2019t tell her the extent of his caring for you.

They need to figure it out.

He did what an actual boyfriend would do for a girlfriend he cares about.  Something he has obviously NOT done for your sister.  And he did this for 3 days, and likely never told your sister where he was spending his time.  I would send him a kind thank you note and then avoid him like the plague.

You should have asked him if she knew he was taking care of you. Maybe texted her to ask if maybe she sent him there. While it seems like a very kind gesture you don't know that he isn't working an angel to get the door opened for flirting. I say this because if HE did not tell your sister that he was coming to help you out, that means he has something to hide, and that is bad news. Next thing you know you'll be asking if you ATAH for making out with your sister's boyfriend behind her back, and no one wants that.

Not saying she\u2019s the AH just that it seems odd.", "She did say it \"wasn't in his nature,\" which does make me think that he doesn't do it for her, which does take this from sweet behavior to questionable. Why be this doting on the sister but not also the girlfriend? Assuming that is what the sister meant by that. But of course even if he is being weird that's still not OP's fault.", "i mean yeah but this is the same person who instead of checking on her sister just told her boyfriend my sister is sick and hadnt stopped by to see her until 2 days later. just spitballing maybe he doesn\u2019t do it for her because she doesnt put that effort for anyone else", "True the question is am I the asshole, which she\u2019s not but being that sister I would\u2019ve felt awkward having my sisters bf pay that much attention to me.", "NTA and there are some people on this post with major trust issues. Here's how it reads to me:\n\nOP is 18, seemingly living alone. She is incredibly sick, calls her sister, presumably for help. Parents are never mentioned...so again, basically a kid home alone sick. \n\nSister couldn't be bothered to come for 2-3 days, but had mentioned it to her bf. BF seemingly a decent human thinks to himself, \"no one is checking on this sick kid, guess I should\". Nothing here reads as inappropriate, loving, etc. Simply reads as a decent person who has a little compassion for someone young and too sick to care for herself.", "NAH , she feels weird that he\u2019s giving you a different level of intimacy then his usual self.", "NTA. I can kind of agree with your sister that it\u2019s weird that he\u2019s acting like this with you and it\u2019s \u201cnot in his nature\u201d but that\u2019s not your fault and none of this is weird to accept from someone you know.

Your sister should count herself lucky she found a good one.", "NTA- \nYou were sick and needed help, he offered help. You weren't in the position to decline. But, it's odd this went on for days and your sister had no idea this was happening. Why aren't they communicating? Was this hidden? This could have been totally innocent and he could just be a good guy. Overall it seems like they are having some relationship issues and you were caught in the middle.", "Hmm, I was in a spot like the bf years ago. My gf and I lived a few blocks away from her parents and younger sister. A couple of times her sister was I\u2019ll and I would check up on her and keep her company because my gf and her parents worked full time and I worked part time. Also went with when he had her wisdom teeth pulled. I liked her sister but wasn\u2019t secretly pining for her. She was very important to my gf, who was happy I would help her family. Not saying this guy is the same but it seems plausible", "NTA but i can definitely see why sis would be upset\u2026this is kiiiinda suspicious and weird. my husband wouldn\u2019t do this for my sister without mentioning it to me. don\u2019t get me wrong, he absolutely would do that for them, but he would at least run it by me or tell me about his plans. this is a little strange, not going to lie, especially if she said this is not in his nature. i don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, and she shouldn\u2019t take it out on you, but i can see why she would be weirded out.", "NTA - I think the problem is that the boyfriend has never been that thoughtful to the sister. Perhaps because the sister hasn't been that sick while with him or maybe he's simply displaying more effort for OP than she has ever seen from him in general. I wouldn't be thanking my stars if my partner did more for others than they are willing to do for me. Either way, it's not OPs problem that her sister is jealous of the caring treatment.", "It's a big leap to assume he's never shown his own gf the care he's showing OP. Unless he's secretly got the hots for OP, he's probably a nurturing guy and takes care of everyone he loves, especially his gf.", "Then why did the sister say it wasn't in his nature? \nIf your partner was especially caring to you, and then they displayed that level of care to someone else, is that what you would say?", "She may not appreciate or notice everything he does for her, but noticed when the attention was on someone else.", "My ex would also say being nurturing wasn't in my nature despite doing damn near everything like this for him and more; he would use it against me any time I showed even the tiniest amount of caring towards anyone else to elicit victim-points as he complained I never did anything so kind for him...  So I'm a tad skeptical of the sister's comment.", "Oh yeah I am definitely not getting good vibes about the sister at all, but also if she's so awful that he doesn't care for her when she's sick then I don't know why he would be with her?", "For all we know, she may have her plate full and he had free time.\n\nThere is too little information to judge the intentions of him. As OP I would try to talk to her sister and possibly reassure her, that she has no interest in him. Might be overkill, but worth it for her relationship with her sister. And perhaps say thank you to bf, while adding \"I am glad to see, that my sister has a boyfriend who will be do caring for her.\"", "It seems like she was delirious and miserable and was just grateful someone was helping keep her alive. It doesn't sound like her sister or anyone else was helping her? She definitely wasn't in a state where she could take care of herself, so she might not have really been thinking beyond getting through each miserable moment. And she may have a brother-sister kind of bond with the boyfriend, which would make it feel less awkward.", "Maybe.. I guess we'll never know", "Yeah fair enough.. she's clearly immature so I'd also take her comments with a grain of salt. Especially when she then doubled down and blamed OP for developing an intimate rs with him. Self-victimisers really suck the life out of you.. glad you got out \ud83d\ude4f", "NAH but we've seen this type of situation happen in this sub many times. We all know how that ends up playing out ...", "NTA. You were/are very sick and you needed help. There's no way you're TA for accepting it. If anything, your sister should've helped you.\n\nThe boyfriend: I'm going to assume he's genuine and is not TA for caring, but he should've communicated better with your sister. (I do wonder if he has other reasons for being so extra. Does he have a younger sibling he's missing spending time with?)\n\nThe sister: I can't call her TA for finding it weird. My husband is a very kind, caring person and if he did all that for my little sister I'd find it a little over the top. Sweet, but too much. Where she tips into AH territory is for blaming YOU for not stopping him. That is getting too close to the language of rape apologia for me. His actions are his responsibility, and if he tripped over a boundary she never told him about that's not his fault either. She needs to tell him that he made her uncomfortable, and he can decide whether her boundaries are something that works for him.", "Yes, I'm skeptical too. OP's sister may not value her boyfriend and may think very little of him. I mean, OP probably thanked him... I can't say if the sister ever thanked him for things he's did for her. The stuff that came out of the sister's mouth is quite worrying. It saddens me to read the sister assumed such things and attacking OP over stuff sister's own boyfriend did on his own accord. If it's truly odd because he's really not the caring type, the sister should be having conversations with her boyfriend and figure out if there are issues that need resolving.\n\nOP is not the asshole, but sister is. Could be combination of jealousy, self centeredness and immaturity. Kind of strange the sister didn't show that same kind of kindness when sick OP needed her. Makes me think she probably treats her boyfriend the same way... uncaring.", "NTA. Sister\u2019s bf might be in love with you. Sounds like she\u2019s feeling a bit threatened and is blaming you for \u201callowing\u201d bf\u2019s said behavior.", "nta that is so kind of him. I am glad you are safe.", "NTA. It seems like your sister has a boyfriend problem. Her comment about it not being in his nature tells me he wouldn\u2019t do these things for her and that is\u2026 weird. I would not accept his help again considering it may have been nothing to you but seems like it could have been something for him", "NTA: She should be happy, sounds like he will be a great partner and father (if they decide to have kids).", "NTA", "NTA if your sister has a problem with her boyfriend\u2019s behaviour she should bring it up with him not you", "I tend with NAH, but some weird family and relationship dynamics here. \n\nSounds a bit unhealthy to mw to be honest.", "NTA. But I can get where she\u2019s coming from, there should be better boundaries. The watching a movie alone together in bed is a little intimate, but it\u2019s more concerning that it\u2019s \u201cnot in his nature\u201d to be this doting and it sounds like he was dishonest about the extent of his care for you. But it\u2019s not on you to set that boundary and figure out the insecurities there, she should def take that up with her bf. There\u2019s probably a secret fight going on between them which could explain the distance, hopefully she gets that figured out that you\u2019re not the problem- why would anyone turn down a helping hand when they\u2019re sick. \n\nAnd also, I\u2019m not sure why everyone expects someone to drop what they\u2019re doing to take care of an adult sibling that they don\u2019t live with for a common illness unless it was something life threatening? How many of you have stopped working or inconvenienced themselves if they were busy to take care of a sibling who had the flu, cold, food poisoning, etc? She could\u2019ve had a lot on her plate for all we know and told the bf since he was free. Probably expecting him to just check in, try to make sure you\u2019re eating or atleast staying hydrated, and really just help you with important tasks you may be too sick to get done- not anything more intimate. So I\u2019m not even gonna have that as part of the conclusion. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t expect to get taken care of either.", "But sister says it's not in his nature and how he normally acts. Plus u don't know what the sisters commitments were. Maybe she has important exams/work going that she isn't in a position to just leave.", "I agree that the sick sister is NTA but disagree that she should be held to a silly boundary when receiving care. Sleep with the guy? Absolutely not. Refuse help when he offers to hold her hair? At which point in the retching cycle should she have done that? The older sister is overreacting and possibly punishing the sick sister for the older's self doubt. Unfair and unnecessary. Older sis is mean.", "Idk if this is suspicious hes probably doing it to impress the sister. This is the sort of thing I'd do at 19 without considering the optics", "from the comment that she laughed at the BF being cornered I am guessing she didn\u2019t care OP was sick / think it was serious"]}
