Last Sunday was my (20M) aunt\u2019s (~40F) wedding. She has been the cool aunt up until a couple of years ago when I cut contact with a lot of my family.\n\nThis happened because my grandparents on that side had passed away, so I no longer had a connection to the side of the family that has made me feel like shit throughout my childhood. Unfortunately my \u201ccool\u201d aunt is on that side of my family.\n\nI was invited to her wedding as one of those invitations where you invite the whole family. Basically, only my mother received an invitation but it said it expected my siblings and me. I did plan on going but hesitantly.\n\nWell, this might sound like a scheme to get out of the wedding but it really wasn\u2019t. I was sick a few weeks back so it prevented me from working out much. As a result, I hadn\u2019t worked out my legs for two whole weeks.\n\nSo when I finally got to do leg day on the Saturday, the day before my aunt\u2019s wedding, my legs were in no shape to even walk. As a result, I refused to go to the wedding.\n\nMy mother was already angry at me for having cut contact with most of her family a few years back, and she thought I was being petty. She accused me of deliberately hurting myself to not go, but that\u2019s not true as I just followed my program.\n\nMy aunt was even more furious. She claimed she\u2019s been wanting to make amends and that I basically spat on her attempt to do so. She thought that by inviting me to her wedding I\u2019d begin to release any resentment I had for her and her family. I told her I never cut contact with her and that I simply was in no shape to sit on hard cathedral benches for an hour, then start dancing for another couple hours. I told her that it really didn\u2019t have anything to do with family but she wouldn\u2019t believe me.\n\nMy aunt has completely cut contact with me in a second phone call, but most of it was because she did not believe me saying that it was nothing personal. My mother is still very angry at me, but not enough to even talk about it anymore.\n\nMy father, who I think is the most unbiased opinion I can receive since my parents are divorced, told me that I should\u2019ve sucked up the pain for an aunt that has loved and cared for me throughout my childhood.\n\nAITA for missing my aunt\u2019s wedding?\n\nEDIT: Someone in the comments told me to put what I\u2019m about to say here.\n\nI have a lot of hatred for my maternal family because of the way they\u2019ve treated my father for the simple reason he\u2019s Jewish, all of them except for my grandparents for some reason. So when my grandparents died I cut them all off. I didn\u2019t cut off my aunt but our relationship started going downhill anyway.", "created_utc": 1680377030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128vzde/aita_for_missing_my_aunts_wedding_because_im_sore/", "score": 667, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're not honest with others, at least be honest with yourself. I understand you're just 20 and still dumb as shit but at least be honest. Everyone is angry with you because you lied to them.", "YTA, leg day can be really bad but you can force yourself to do things after it as well. At least myself. It's like doing leg day when I have to walk to work the next day, I have to suck up the pain. Can't take days off work cause of leg day", "YTA - that is a weak and pathetic excuse to miss a wedding.   People need RSVPs for a reason.    Even putting all the baggage aside once you RSVP yes to a wedding it's very poor form to skip unless there is a serious incident.", "YTA. Congratulations on making the relationship with your family worse", "YTA.  \u201cMy aunt has always been incredibly cool and kind to me, so I refused to go to her wedding because of leg day.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m wondering if they went NC with you rather than the other way round.", "Yta\n\nYou sound like a gym bro that put *gains* over family. If you have dedicated \"leg days\", then you full well know you're sore the next day. \n\nYou should have manned up and told her you didn't want to go, it would be better than \"I chose to hurt my legs the day before your wedding. \"", "YTA. This is such a ridiculous excuse to miss someone\u2019s wedding. If your reason for skipping was actually that you didn\u2019t want to see the side of the family that you cut contact with, then that\u2019s fine as long as you responded no to the RSVP well in advance. But that\u2019s not what you did. You said yes then made up a dumb excuse to skip it at the last minute. That\u2019s incredibly rude to do to your aunt and I don\u2019t blame her for being upset with you.", "YTA. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know the consequences of leg day.

YTA!", "YTA for being too dense to see this issue coming.", "YTA. That is a ridiculous excuse. If you didn\u2019t want to go to the wedding you should have said no to begin with rather than making up a stupid excuse.", "YTA\n\nIf you were sick for two weeks, you should have altered your workout to be easier on your body as you work up to the level you were at before getting sick. I am neither a gym bro nor even a person who does regimented workouts and I know this. It was stupid, irresponsible, and probably harmful for you to work out like that after being sick. No wonder you couldn\u2019t walk or go to the wedding.\n\nBecause you made a stupid decision that you should have known better than, you missed your chance to reconnect with your aunt on a day that was very important to her. She has every reason to feel the way she does about the situation. \n\nYou may not have injured yourself with the intention of getting out of going to the wedding, but you also should have known this is what would happen, and YTA for choosing to do this regardless and forcing yourself to miss the wedding.", "YTA. A huge one, what a pathetic excuse lol boo hoo my legs hurt from the gym.", "Your father is right, YTA. It's one day that means the world to her, and you couldn't be bothered because you did too many squats?? Jesus kiddo", "YTA If you don't want to go, you don't have to, but at least be a fucking adult and say you don't want to go. 'Oooh, my legs were sore' is a shitty excuse and you know it. If you really wanted to go, you wouldn't have done leg day the day before. Stop being such a brat and take the judgment.", "YTA. You could have taken an aspirin and gone. Such a pathetic excuse.", "Oh come on man, you are all of 20 and \"sore\" legs prevented you from attending a wedding where you basically be sitting? Please. YTA.", "YTA - No contest.", "YTA - I say BS because the best way to make your legs feel better is to not rest, it\u2019s to be in active recovery and move around, walk, etc and work out that lactic acid.", "YTA, I workout and ride/train horses.

I still go and do things that are important. You\u2019re sitting not doing anything rigorous, you just don\u2019t wanna sit. You don\u2019t have to dance at a wedding you could simply sit and chat, it\u2019s just another excuse.

I don\u2019t understand how you can say she was the \u201ccool\u201d aunt but couldn\u2019t suck up the pain to be there on a special day for her. Hopefully you listen to what your dad said and learn from this. \n\nI have to add, if your aunt really wanted to make amends, she wouldn\u2019t have waited until her wedding day hoping you\u2019d show up. BUT this is no excuse for your behavior.", "Weird flex but ok... YTA. \nI was 3 weeks out from ACL surgery & still using a crutch, but I made it to a wedding.", "YTA\n\nYou knew you would be sore. You could have gone lighter or postponed for another couple of days. You knowingly put yourself in a position that would require either an excuse or sucking it up.\n\nIt was up to you if you wanted to go or not, but you picked the dumbest way of skipping that you could.", "Holy obliviousness, Batman. \n\nWe don\u2019t have context for why you went NC/LC with family and maybe that\u2019s justified. But by your own admission this aunt seems to be one of the good ones? So why be so rude and cavalier about attending her wedding? \n\nYTA, sorry.", "Look, you clearly didn\u2019t want to go. But such a pathetic excuse is not good enough. You don\u2019t HAVE to dance, and sitting on an uncomfortable bench is not the end of the world to show respect and care to a family member who cared for you. YTA, most definitely.", "If you rsvpd yes, then you go. You don't decide on the day of the wedding. Leg Day! What the hell kind of excuse is that? You should never even use the phrase \"leg day\". Ever.", "YTA\n\nJust for posting this, honestly. You\u2019re fighting with people in the comments claiming that no matter what you won\u2019t apologize - so what\u2019s the point of even being here? It just seems like you expected to be pat on the back for not doing the adult thing and just declining the invitation to a wedding you clearly didn\u2019t want to go to. If you don\u2019t care whether or not you\u2019re the AH there\u2019s literally no point in being here.\n\nETA: you\u2019re also sending extremely mixed messages here, from the top the way you frame it it seems as if you *did* cut contact with your aunt as a side effect of her being part of your mother\u2019s side of the family and at the end you\u2019re saying that you *didn\u2019t* cut contact with her. So did you, or didn\u2019t you? Did you talk to her during the two years, or at least attempt to or did you not?", "YTA, as well as an awful son and nephew.", "YTA Your Aunt deserved better from you. You knew you had a wedding to go to so why did you over do in the first place. Time to grow up dude. You should apologize and try to make amends to your Aunt.", "YTA. \ud83d\ude02", "YTA", "YTA.

As someone who has been through her share of horrendously sore days, I\u2019d rather believe you didn\u2019t want to go and are using a lame excuse than have the grit to workout hard but not the grit to attend a wedding for a favorite aunt the next day where all you\u2019d have to sit, kneel, and stand for an hour and a half.", "ESH.

You must have known that working your legs that much after not doing anything for a while would cause you trouble walking, so you should have either skipped leg day or done half of everything.

If your relationship with your aunt is important you should have gone. If it was based on not wanting to be around that side of the family (which is valid) you should have said no in the first place and you two could have been in a better place.", "YTA", "You obviously sabotaged yourself deliberately.

Take an ibuprofen, use a foam roller for a few minutes, and go to the wedding.", "YTA and your dad is right.", "YTA dude what a weak excuse lol\n\nI'm more than 10 years older than you and guaranteed in worse shape.

It's called being an adult. Try that sometime.", "YTA. I competed in a half Ironman race and then attended a concert that evening. Trust me, a half Ironman is much harder than your leg day. You may have been sore or tired but this is the worst excuse to miss a wedding.", "Lollll What. Im sorry, your legs hurt so you couldn\u2019t attend a wedding? \n\nThat\u2019s the most pathetic excuse I\u2019ve ever heard. Akin to \u201cI have a paper cut\u201d.

A huge one.", "NTA you don't owe anyone anything and seems like your other side of your family didn't treat u well so it's cool", "YTA do some light jogging before the wedding and suck it up buttercup.", "YTA. I took my first spin class and really overexerted myself. My legs were in so much pain and wobbly and I still walked in a parade the next day. You can go to a wedding. You don't even have to dance!", "I\u2019m suffering from leg day and it\u2019s Day Two afterwards & I\u2019m still moving like I\u2019m 102 years old. I get it, I barely want to move let alone leave the house. But I\u2019m with your dad on this. You should\u2019ve gone. The least you can do at this point is a heartfelt letter of apology with a gift card to a spa for her or letter + high tea outing (something special) just the two of you.", "YTA big time.\n\nYou're self centered, and what did your aunt ever do?

So so clearly YTA. Don't even blame it on being sore from leg day. You'd have found literally any reason not to go. Also, if you're doing leg day so hard you can't even walk, that's not a workout, that's an injury. Recovery from a workout has to be gentle to see any gains from it, because the recovery is where you actually build muscle, so I guess YTA twice in this story.", "Idk.. her reaction was still just too intense.

It's about her trying to guilt you into feeling bad for cutting contact, and trying to use her wedding to manipulate you.\n\nIf she actually cared, she would have asked to get together before hand, or even reached out in person.", "NTA. It\u2019s really funny how they were cool treating you like shit when you were a young man,  but now you\u2019re just supposed to forget all that and play by their rules? Nah.

In fact, the worst pain is usually two days after the workout if you're working muscles hard, so by dancing and moving around on Sunday and getting that lactic acid worked out of the muscles, you might have actually lessened your pain on Monday.

If anything forcing you into a situation that would put you in close contact with an entire side of the family you wanted nothing to do with is very dubious. It definitely needed more work than an invite to settle the issue before hand. I suspect that you could have gone if it wasn't so complicated, legs or not.

Last Sunday was my (20M) aunt\u2019s (~40F) wedding. She has been the cool aunt up until a couple of years ago when I cut contact with a lot of my family.\n\nThis happened because my grandparents on that side had passed away, so I no longer had a connection to the side of the family that has made me feel like shit throughout my childhood. Unfortunately my \u201ccool\u201d aunt is on that side of my family.\n\nI was invited to her wedding as one of those invitations where you invite the whole family. Basically, only my mother received an invitation but it said it expected my siblings and me. I did plan on going but hesitantly.\n\nWell, this might sound like a scheme to get out of the wedding but it really wasn\u2019t. I was sick a few weeks back so it prevented me from working out much. As a result, I hadn\u2019t worked out my legs for two whole weeks.\n\nSo when I finally got to do leg day on the Saturday, the day before my aunt\u2019s wedding, my legs were in no shape to even walk. As a result, I refused to go to the wedding.\n\nMy mother was already angry at me for having cut contact with most of her family a few years back, and she thought I was being petty. She accused me of deliberately hurting myself to not go, but that\u2019s not true as I just followed my program.\n\nMy aunt was even more furious. She claimed she\u2019s been wanting to make amends and that I basically spat on her attempt to do so. She thought that by inviting me to her wedding I\u2019d begin to release any resentment I had for her and her family. I told her I never cut contact with her and that I simply was in no shape to sit on hard cathedral benches for an hour, then start dancing for another couple hours. I told her that it really didn\u2019t have anything to do with family but she wouldn\u2019t believe me.\n\nMy aunt has completely cut contact with me in a second phone call, but most of it was because she did not believe me saying that it was nothing personal. My mother is still very angry at me, but not enough to even talk about it anymore.\n\nMy father, who I think is the most unbiased opinion I can receive since my parents are divorced, told me that I should\u2019ve sucked up the pain for an aunt that has loved and cared for me throughout my childhood.\n\nAITA for missing my aunt\u2019s wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You could say you got stomach pains or something more believable than \"its after leg day\". At least then no one would say you didn't try, which you didn't. Idk man I'd be pretty hurt if one of my nephews missed out on my wedding when I've been good to him and his excuse was that he worked out too hard the day before.
