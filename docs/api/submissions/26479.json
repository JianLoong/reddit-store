{"id": 26479, "submission_id": "16dijr2", "title": "AITA for issuing with my half sister with an ultimatum; drop the attitude with my grandma or step down as a bridesmaid?", "selftext": "I (28f) am getting married to my wonderful fiance Casey (29m). We both actually chose to ask a grandparent to be our best man and maid of honor. Casey wanted his grandpa who basically took care of him when his family was going through a horrific tragedy and he wouldn't have survived without his grandpa. He is very much the man he sees as his true parent. Whereas for me, I want my grandma to be my maid of honor. When I lost my mom she was the only connection I had to her and she was very much the love and light in my life for a long while. She is the one person I could talk to about missing mom.\n\nMy half sister (20f) is another bridesmaid, along with my best friend.\n\nMy half sister is not related to my grandma, she's my dad's kid, not my mom's. The two of them have no relationship outside of seeing each other a handful of times prior to being in my wedding party. I'm not very close with my half sister. But I recognize that she always wanted to be closer and I knew she would want to be a bridesmaid, which she did.\n\nI did not realize she would hate that my grandma is my maid of honor. But for the last several weeks she has been rude to my grandma. She has dropped some comments that having a cold hearted maid of honor must be tough. She suggested grandma get some work done so she doesn't look like an old hag in the wedding photos. I told her to cut it out repeatedly. I spoke to her after the second incident and told her she did not get to be rude to grandma and if she wasn't careful she would be out of the wedding party.\n\nThe comments have continued and grandma admitted my half sister has been saying stuff behind my back. So I confronted her and told her she has two choices... she can either knock it off, apologize and keep her comments to herself OR she can step down as bridesmaid because my grandma is not going anywhere.\n\nShe told me I shouldn't be making her do this. She said she should have been maid of honor for starters and she should not be expected to be fine with a woman who did not want to embrace her as part of her family when she did nothing wrong. She said it kills her to see me so close to grandma when grandma chose not to be part of her life. She said regardless of which of my parents grandma's related to me by, she's my half sister and grandma should have embraced having another grandchild. She said my ultimatum is unfair and cruel to her when I'm aware of the past and when I know she isn't comfortable around my grandma.\n\nI actually had no idea she felt that way about grandma. But knowing that doesn't change that for me. Maybe that makes me TA.

You sound like you weren\u2019t aware.  Kids grow up, and now little sister is letting her feelings be known.  I don\u2019t feel sorry for grandma because I have an issue when grownups treat children differently, related or not.  But, this battle should not play out at your wedding.  Everyone should act polite at your wedding festivities.

I\u2019ve known so many family members that have grandkids from their child\u2019s ex spouses/or widowed and remarried with children and they treat them equally because that is the sibling of their grandchildren. The fact op keeps repeating half-sister it has been a word used constantly by an adult as a child. Not many people refer to step-siblings or half-siblings that much unless there\u2019s a complex about having one and to detach from having a normal sibling bond. Did your stepmom treat you badly? Any tension between stepmom and grandmother? Definitely should have a talk with with all three of you to start from fresh and hopefully have a wonderful relationship with your sister and grandmother. I hope you have a beautiful wedding and no regrets of not having someone by your side.", "INFO: What kind of relationship do you have with step-mother and her parents (half sisters grandparents?) \n\nReserve judgment for now, but half sister is most definitely rude and immature.", "I would never reject my grandchild\u2019s half sibling and as the adult grandma should have been kinder.

Your sister was rude to a very important person in your life, so she needs to behave. \n\nHowever, I can't help feeling there's a big chunk of the story that was left out.

Your half- sister was totally out of line with what she said, just saying about a regular person, but especially saying it to your grandmother makes it worse.  She had her maternal family and you had yours.  You warned her and she continued, stop the drama.  Enjoy your wedding", "NTA, but you and your sister are way overdue for a heart-to-heart talk. \n\nWhen you were 13/14, she was 5/6. So her earliest memories coincide with the time you were becoming more independent and spending more time out of the house. It's natural for kids to want to hang around their big sister/brother. It is also natural for teenagers to not want to be around younger kids. \n\nI think your sister felt rejected. Since she was jealous of the time you spent with your grandmother instead of her, it became easy to just blame your grandmother. \n\nNow that you are both adults, it is possible for you to be closer than ever. But, you really need to talk about this.", "tbh it sounds like you never actually wanted her to be a bridesmaid at all, and just did it because you knew she wanted and expected it. but it\u2019s still not enough for her, she wants to be maid of honor, and i\u2019d guess she\u2019d be awful to anyone you chose just because she wants it to be her. not saying she doesn\u2019t also resent your gma, just saying she\u2019d find a reason no matter what. how bout you plan your wedding based on your own wants, and take your half sister\u2019s wants out of the equation entirely? would it look different? do you think you\u2019ll be happier with her as a bridesmaid or no? there\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with doing things for others, but sometimes they just won\u2019t appreciate anything less than center stage, and at that point maybe just let them sit in the audience. nta.", "Can I ask why? Was it due to her being your half sister that you didn\u2019t want to be close?", "So from your half sister\u2019s childhood perspective, your grandma was a barrier between her and you being closer?", "Ok ESH (except grandma)\n\nYou should not have put them both in your wedding party after a lifetime of not wanting them to have a relationship.", "Does your half-sister have both a maternal and paternal grandparent?", "Especially when it sounds like, from your comment, that your dad was basically an AH and caused pain to her daughter (your mom).", "Anyone with half a heart lol", "Maybe little sister felt left out not going to grandma's house.  Of course she also had grandparents on her mom's side who likely had little to no contact with you.  Sorry you're going through this.", "I Second that. Your grandma tried her best to be the bridge to your dead mom. Telling grandma she needs to embrace your dads daughter, such entitelment... your Mom died, hers is alive - could ask her If that was fair to her... hard but true", "Not OP, but 8 year age gap is HUGE as kids. It would definitely be the exception if they were close.", "Just maternal. Same as me.", "It's not recquired to be a grandma to your ex son in law's new kid. It's a ridiculous demand. What half a heart and all that crap??? Has the world gone crazy?? Why on earth would she give a flying fuck about that guy's new kid??", "Yes, dad didn't have family in our lives but she had her mom's family. I just had grandma.", "If that\u2019s the case, it might be something that needs saying.  I wonder if the half sister felt rejected as part of the family\u2026. And feelings like that\u2026they don\u2019t go away.", "Got it. \n\nSounds like she wanted to have you as a true sister and resents your grandmother for being close to you when she isn't.", "OP - just has her grandparents from her late mother's side from her comments while her step-sister had both her mother's & father's family... Plus the 8 yr gap... \n\nThis was a point for them to become friends as adults. Instead, she, step-sister, told her to choose when they were just starting to build the bridge of getting along. \n\nIf I had to make an educated guess OP was shipped to/spent a lot of quality time with her grandparents and her step-sister didn't see her grandparents as much but she did get her parents... And no explained why..."]}
