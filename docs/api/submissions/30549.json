My wife and I have met her once and she gave us the absolute worst first impression of her, due to her being rude, conceited, and completely belittling. I have never had a more awkward and upsetting meal in my life. They have decided to continue their Usain Bolt 100m relationship and elope next summer. To celebrate with family, they have decided on a gathering in May 2024... the exact same date of my friend's wedding. In addition, this will be the day after I've been away from home for 5 straight months for work. \n\nMy parents and brother don't seem to understand that I've already committed to an important event on this day.

You have a long-standing prior commitment, if it was important that you be at this engagement party then they could very easily move the date", "NTA - an engagement party could be missed for run of the mill work events let alone a wedding you already committed to.  They aren\u2019t that big of a deal. At all. And as you comically point out, it\u2019s highly unlikely this one is going the distance anyway. (Before people come at me, I\u2019m kidding. I know you cannot take that into account etiquette-wise).", "NTA. Even if you liked her a wedding you\u2019ve already committed to trumps engagement party.", "NTA. One, you accepted the invite for the wedding first. Two, weddings are more important than engagement parties. Three, if your brother really wanted you there he would move his engagement party to a weekend that works better for you.", "I feel like I didn't even have to read that whole thing to give you my NTA ruling lol \n\nIf your brother and parents can't understand, tough. It sucks, but it's true. You've already made your commitment to your friend, and you actually want to attend his wedding anyway. Obviously you can't be as blas\u00e9 as I'm being about this, so I suggest you just keep trying to make them understand why exactly you can't come to the engagement party but that you are over the moon excited that your brother is getting married (if you wanna go the white lie route). Maybe get them a good gift to make up for it if you're really feeling bad about it.", "NTA. It isn't like you are missing the wedding and it sounds like you have already met his fiance. So go enjoy your friend's wedding guilt free.", "NTA at all. You've made a commitment to your friend and, barring emergencies of course, it would be wrong to renege on your commitment. These things happen, and unfortunately in life, we sometimes have to miss out on things which seem important to others, because we are already fulfilling what's important to someone else who got in there first.", "Nta- engagement parties aren\u2019t a real thing of importance, weddings are a big deal", "NTA - it\u2019s an engagement party (are those still a thing), not the wedding. They had 7 months to plan it and you have an actual once in a life time event. You\u2019ll make the wedding. I would say this even if his fianc\u00e9e wasn\u2019t a troll.", "NTA. Wedding trumps engagement party, and a prior commitment at that.", "NTA You are already committed to an important event.  All you can say to your brother is best wishes. It\u2019s too bad they didn\u2019t let you know about the date before setting it in stone. Too bad.", "NTA for choosing your friend\u2019s wedding, but most of the story is not really relevant (a common theme on here) and you sound pretty judgmental about your brother in general.  If you miss your brother\u2019s party in order to make a statement about him or his relationship, I think it\u2019s pretty reasonable that he might get offended.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The correct answer in so many AITA situations is just to be blandly polite and let people make their own choices.  Here you have an important prior commitment, which is really the end of the story."]}
