Candice has this thing where she has no regard for boundaries for humans or animals. I have a cat, Tissue, who's a complete dick. Tissue will sit there, and he won't run away from you, but if you try to rub him without him asking for a rub, he'll bite you. Candice knows this. She also knows that if Tissue wants attention, he will absolutely demand it and if you don't give it to him, he'll also bite you, but it's more a nibble, doesn't usually hurt and it's just kins of a warning because he's a cunt and I've let him get away with it the last 3 years.\n\nCandice was at my house last Thursday. As per usual, I told her don't rub the cat because he didn't want attention. He was on his side of the table (where he sleeps), and we were having a cup of coffee. Candice decided she wasn't respecting Tissue's boundaries, because she's an idiot who clearly enjoys getting bitten. She went to rub Tissue. He was behaved, he actually snarled at her the first time to tell her to please go away, then he hissed, and she rubbed a 3rd time and he locked onto her so hard he drew blood. And it was her own fault. Tissue ran of the room so he was no longer being tormented by the demon lady and she was like well what was that for train your stupid cat and basically giving out saying there was no warning. I told her to go to the doctor and get antibiotics because cat bites can be dangerous.\n\nFast forward to today, Candice rings me and tells me she had to go to the emergency room because she has an infection from the cat bite. She needs to stay in the hospital for IV antibiotics, and basically I'll have to reimburse her for the medical expenses. I told her I wasn't reimbursing her, since she knew not to touch the cat and proceeded to, despite Tissue even warning her to back off.\n\nMy mom and my brother got involved and they both think I'm being an ass for not covering at least some, my dad thinks I'm right, because I warned Candice, and have many times in the past. It's been causing major issues over the last few hours, and my mom and brother think I'm an asshole.

I taught my cats to do headbutts when they want attention and this is much better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>he will absolutely demand it and if you don't give it to him, he'll also bite you, but it's more a nibble,", "There is a big difference between a love nibble and a bite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough I generally agree and have taught my cats to headbutt me.  Which he is doing right now because he wants food.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, this was absolutely not the situation here and thus does not really play a role in this particular story.", ">Why is it that people's dogs have to be trained but people's cats can just get away with whatever?\n\nAsking that question definitely means that you do not understand cats.  While cats are trainable, they are not trainable in the same way as a dog is.", "Is there a difference between a dog love-biting and outright biting? Absolutely yes. Many dog owners have received \u201clove-bites\u201d from their dogs as an attempt at co-grooming/showing affection. Like with this cat, a love-bite from a dog is closer to a nibble/does not break skin, so yes, I\u2019m sure there are people who have different boundaries with dogs when it comes to love-bites v actual bites.\n\nAsking why a cat can\u2019t be trained like a dog feels like you have no experience with either.", "I bet you have never had a rescue cat that was abused by a previous owner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I agree that you can teach cats to a certain point, you cannot teach them to ignore their own safety and most will protect themselves from assholes like the SIL in this story.  And rightfully so.", "Reasonable yes, but completely unprovable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, there are idiot owners who reinforce shitty behaviour.  I am not disagreeing with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am laughing at your claim to KNOW that this is the situation in this particular case.", "You don't need to defend yourself to that person. Tissue has obviously had a rough go and it sounds like you really love your cat and have given him a good home. He sounds very lucky to have you!\n\nI have a cat who is pretty well behaved, but will bite if you pet him too long. We warn all our house guests of this and always offer to put him in another area of the house if they'd like. The thing is, he likes people so he will hang around unless we put him somewhere else. All of our friends know this and choose to let him stay in the room (they think he's cute lol). \n\nSome have gotten scratched, but all admit that we warned them and they wanted to pet him anyway and tested their luck. No one has been seriously hurt and they still want him to stay in the room lol He was a street cat for the first year of life and it's hard to erase that. We got our other cat when she was a kitten and she's the sweetest cat you've ever met, never bites or anything.", "Aw, he really is a little shit tissue!", "You're ignoring the issue that op admitted they basically allow it to continue though.  Cats can be taught to stop unwanted behaviour through not rewarding it.  Jackson Galaxy has great advice on how to dissuade from certain behaviors.", "No shit sherlock. I specifically said that in this particular situation, OP was not the AH. I was just pointing out why some people are saying ESH instead of NTA. As to your \"love nibble\" comment, now you're putting words in OP's mouth. OP said it bites people when it wants attention, although OP tried to downplay it as a nibble. But OP described it first as \"a bite.\"", "If I\u2019m visiting someone\u2019s house, I expect to not be mauled, bit or nibbled by any animal.  I don\u2019t care if the owner calls it a \u201clove bite\u201d.", "Yes I have. I have adopted two cats who were in extreme abuse. One was even a former street cat. \n\nThe OP should have intervened on the cat's behalf with the human. That's how you make the cat feel secure enough that they don't have to be defensive of themselves. When they see that you will stand between them and the danger they no longer feel the need to do it themselves.", "He's clapped. If it weren't for the fact I felt so bad for him, I wouldn't have taken him", "Perhaps you should read the post in detail before claiming that I am putting words in OPs mouth:\n\n>She also knows that if Tissue wants attention, he will absolutely demand it and if you don't give it to him, he'll also bite you, but it's more a nibble, doesn't usually hurt and it's just kins of a warning", "Don't worry.  I am sure any cat would stay the f\\*ck away from you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you visit my place, I EXPECT you to treat my cats with respect.  If you don't they will let you know.  If you refuse to take the hint from my cats, then you will no longer be welcome at my place.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cats are kind do not attack people.  They only reacted in self-defence.", ">The OP should have intervened on the cat's behalf with the human.\n\nOP warned her, and the cat warned her; several times.  Some people are just stupid.", "Where does it say it\u2019s a \u201clove nibble\u201d? OP describes it as a \u201cbite\u201d that \u201cdoesn\u2019t usually hurt.\u201d Oh good, so it only hurts occasionally. I guess it\u2019s ok to let it hire people for attention then as long as it doesn\u2019t *usually* hurt.", "Are we on the same comment thread? Because people here are agreeing that bothering them cat is not okay. No one is implying anything about YOUR cats."]}
