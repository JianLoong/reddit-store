There is no bigger turn off. \n\nYeah, you would be TA.", "YWBTA you would ABSOLUTELY be the asshole. Using this girls vulnerability against her just so you can have a leg up with your friends? C'mon dude. You have to know that breaking a promise of the girl who made you feel like a man for first time is a complete asshole move, right?", "YWBTA. She asked you not to and if you do tell, there\u2019s a high possibility you\u2019re going to blow your chances.

Your pride is not more important.", "YWBTA\n\nYou promised her not to tell and respect her privacy.", "YWBTA. She asked you not to, you agreed, you\u2019d be a lying asshole.

Until then, nobody should know", "The reason that you\u2019d very much be YTA is that you\u2019d be breaking 2 huge fundamentals: 1) trust - you gave her your word, and if she learns that you\u2019ve gone back on this, you won\u2019t have another date, & 2) you would be treating her like an object or commodity - and baring actual criminal offences, there\u2019s no quicker way of getting dumped - as it shows that you think of her as a *thing* not a **person**", "YWBTA. Completely. She asked you not to say. You *know* that means a good person wouldn't say. Respect her privacy because she should mean more to you than one detail of your reputation with your friends.\n\nPlus, come on, you're missing the big picture here. If you don't tell your friends now and end up going out with Lily how surprised will they be and how cool will you look? Even if you and Lily don't go out but just have a friendly thing, you're still way cooler than if you betray her trust now.", "YWBTA\n\nDon\u2019t dump your friends if you don\u2019t want to.

Like why do men need bragging rights. If you like her , respect her and might want to see her again keep it quiet as she asked as if it progresses and you end up in a relationship your \u2018friends\u2019 will be red in the face as you will have someone you like , and who likes you which is worth taking shit from your \u2018mates\u2019", "YWBTA, because you'd be breaking your promise to her!

Don't betray her trust.", "YWBTA\n\nIf you want to be a real man, keep your promise. \nListen, your \"friends\", and your reputation with them, are not worth losing the girl you like.\n\nIf they make fun of you, either cut them off or just be content with knowing the truth. \nThey don't have to know, YOU know that this girl is not out of your league, YOU know that she likes you.
