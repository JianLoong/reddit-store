I\u2019m f17 and my parents had an accident baby when I was 13. This spawn from hell is named Ferris and I literally do not care to use a fake name for him.\n\nFerris is obsessed with anything having to do with Sesame Street. It\u2019s one of the only kids shows he\u2019s allowed to watch due to the fact that my parents are weird and think that other children\u2019s shows nowadays are \u201cpollution for young minds\u201d. Not getting into that but anyway. Ferris\u2019 favorite Sesame Street character is Big Bird and he has had quite the impressive infatuation with him since practically birth. There are in fact 4 different Big Bird stuffed animals on his dressing table of various sizes as well as plenty of other Big Bird merch in his room.\n\nThese details are unimportant but they provide context I guess. Anyway, on Saturday, my family and I went to Red Robin for dinner and the four of us were seated in the booth eating appetizers when Ferris started crying and whining like he always does because my mom is trying to force him to try her appetizer (she got a basket of fried pickles). My mom is always making attempts to \u201chelp Ferris expand his palate\u201d and he just refuses. My dad told my mom to let him be and asked Ferris what he wanted for dinner. Ferris replied by screaming \u201cCHICKENNNN\u201d making several people in the restaurant look at us, but of course they didn\u2019t shush him and my parents granted his wish. \n\nWhen we all ordered and Ferris got his chicken, he decided he wanted my macaroni and cheese (yes I ordered off the kids menu, I am vegetarian and only wanted macaroni and cheese with salad). So my parents told me to give him half of my macaroni and cheese. After like three minutes of arguing with them I finally shoved my plate over to him and said he could just have it all because why the hell not. They were pissed with me for cursing and \u201cpolluting his impressionable mind with profanity\u201d (paraphrased) and made me apologize to him. \n\nAfter Ferris ate my macaroni and cheese he naturally decided to eat all the rest of his chicken strips too. As he\u2019s chowing down on his strips I\u2019m pissed so I say \u201cOh no! You\u2019re eating Big Bird! He\u2019s dead!\u201d resulting in Ferris wailing as if I just informed him our dog died. My parents are FURIOUS with me and my dad had to take Ferris to the bathroom to calm him down. My mom immediately took my phone and I only just got it back last night while my dad decided to add onto the punishment after quite a lot of shouting at me and informed me I am not allowed to see my friends until next week. All this over a Sesame Street joke so yeah I\u2019m pretty pissed. When I spoke to a friend today at school she told me it was \u201ckinda b*tchy\u201d of me to do that and now I feel like I am going crazy, Aita here please Reddit?", "created_utc": 1697652463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ax7pe/aita_i_told_my_4_year_old_brother_hes_eating_big/", "score": 279, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope that you one day develop a little bit of empathy.", "YTA. You're mean. You're jealous of that poor child and acting out. That was a really nasty thing to do. Your parents should have told him no, but you did not have to react in such a horrible manner. You could have given him two spoonfuls, but you threw a tantrum.

I think you were enraged at your parents and at Ferris and said what you did to be shocking and to cause pain.\n\nYTA\n\nThat said, there's a real problem with your folk's parenting, and the fact that their failure to set limits with Ferris impinges upon you.  Forcing you to give up your food to him (as opposed to letting him taste yours and then ordering some for him if he liked it) is a prime example, and also, sadly, works as a metaphor.  He gets fed at your expense; his gain is your loss.\n\nI think it would be really good if you could sit down and talk with your parents about this, and even to request family therapy for the three of you.  They need to hear what you have to say.  Your rage came from somewhere, and their behavior helps keep it burning.", "YTA. That's a four year old, dude. His behavior is 100% developmentally appropriate for his age as far as I can tell. Your behavior, on the other hand, is that of a wildly immature, spoiled rotten AH who is being unnecessarily cruel to a toddler, not a nearly adult young woman. Are you serious with this?", "yes, YTA. how dare you make a horrific connection to something that little boy loves. also, big bird is a canary.", "This is hilarious, and the most Sibling thing I've seen on here in 5ever.\nBut honestly ESH. \n\nLittle kids, annoying as they can be, Only KNOW so much. \nWhat they think they know comes Solely from what lucky experiences they've had that didn't hurt them, what parents or people they trust tell them, etc.", "YTA. \n\nYou purposely behaved with cruelty and unkindness toward a toddler, when your frustration needs to be directed toward your parents. \n\nFerris didn't ask to be brought into the world and he's learning how to communicate and interact with the world under the guidance of your parents.

They forced you to share your food with him. I assume all you ate at the restaurant was the salad you ordered. Your parents catering to him will turn him into an AH as he gets older, because no one is gonna cater to him and give him everything he wants, even if he whines. People looked at you all funny because he screamed \"chicken\" in the restaurant. I'm sure they weren't happy, but gave it some grace, since he's 4. It's not gonna get better, unless your parents start parenting. They're enablers.", "ESH. The parents should have just ordered the kid macaroni, don't give him yours. \n\nYour parents are not doing the two of you any favors.

It was not funny that you told a toddler he was eating one of his favorite characters.", "YTA. I really hope this is just rage porn and you're not actually this blind to how your own behavior affects others that you are asking this question in earnest. \n\nSo in case you're really this clueless, yes. It's an asshole thing to do to yell at a four year old because you're mad. You should seriously consider speaking to your parents and asking them to look into supports to assist you in developing your social-emotional awareness. It will show them that you accept responsibility for your actions and genuinely desire to work on becoming a more mature son, brother and reasonable member of society that is capable of keeping his emotions in check as to not lash out at small children over minor offenses.", "OP, out of curiosity please answer this. Say your dog died one day. You come home, no one tells you. Dinner that night is some fake meat substitute lasagne.

He's literally a small child.  He's acting his age.  He didn't ask to be born, and yet you're just oozing vitriol towards him.

You are almost grown his about using your words like, hey if I am still hungry will you order more since you had me share with my brother? \n\nYes they should have ordered him his own I would bet they were worried he wouldn't eat it since he seems to be a picky eater. Which you have now made so much worse by removing an item he was excited to eat and traumatizing a little kid. You could have given him enough for a spoonful to see if he would eat it then asked them to order him his own. Instead you decided to also be 4 years old. \n\nGet help, you obviously have some rage issues and issues surrounding the birth if your brother that you need to work through.", "YTA. 100%. Ferris a fucking toddler; they don't understand jokes. You should feel horrible. That fact that you don't is worrying.", "I'm sorry to do this to you OP, but YTA.\n\nI'm going to assume here that you have issues with your parents having another child.\nBeing a single child until you are 13 and then having to suddenly share everything is a big change, I understand that.\nBut it is not a change that you can't adjust to.\n\nIt sounds like there are underlying feelings that are causing you to lash out at the kid.\nI get that you're young and you'll probably change your mind 10 years from now, but it would help everyone involved if you could start to see it sooner.\n\nI have 3 kids myself, eldest 15 and youngest 6.\nThe eldest gets annoyed by the youngest but also loves her sibling incredibly much.\n\nIf my youngest wouldn't eat anymore chicken because of a joke my eldest made, I would make her fix it. Let her explain that it was a joke and calm her down.\n\nJust like you, at 17, don't understand the impact a joke can have on a 4 year old.\nA 4 year old doesn't understand you are making a joke.\nYou're both in the process of learning, he is simply in an earlier stage than you.\n\nYou need to start seeing your little brother for what he is, your brother. Neither of you asked to be here, but here you both are! Try to make the best of it. There will be plenty of actual problems to worry about in the future. So enjoy your youth while you can and watch your little bro grow up, maybe start teaching him stuff and see he's a real person, just like you.

I\u2019m f17 and my parents had an accident baby when I was 13. This spawn from hell is named Ferris and I literally do not care to use a fake name for him.\n\nFerris is obsessed with anything having to do with Sesame Street. It\u2019s one of the only kids shows he\u2019s allowed to watch due to the fact that my parents are weird and think that other children\u2019s shows nowadays are \u201cpollution for young minds\u201d. Not getting into that but anyway. Ferris\u2019 favorite Sesame Street character is Big Bird and he has had quite the impressive infatuation with him since practically birth. There are in fact 4 different Big Bird stuffed animals on his dressing table of various sizes as well as plenty of other Big Bird merch in his room.\n\nThese details are unimportant but they provide context I guess. Anyway, on Saturday, my family and I went to Red Robin for dinner and the four of us were seated in the booth eating appetizers when Ferris started crying and whining like he always does because my mom is trying to force him to try her appetizer (she got a basket of fried pickles). My mom is always making attempts to \u201chelp Ferris expand his palate\u201d and he just refuses. My dad told my mom to let him be and asked Ferris what he wanted for dinner. Ferris replied by screaming \u201cCHICKENNNN\u201d making several people in the restaurant look at us, but of course they didn\u2019t shush him and my parents granted his wish. \n\nWhen we all ordered and Ferris got his chicken, he decided he wanted my macaroni and cheese (yes I ordered off the kids menu, I am vegetarian and only wanted macaroni and cheese with salad). So my parents told me to give him half of my macaroni and cheese. After like three minutes of arguing with them I finally shoved my plate over to him and said he could just have it all because why the hell not. They were pissed with me for cursing and \u201cpolluting his impressionable mind with profanity\u201d (paraphrased) and made me apologize to him. \n\nAfter Ferris ate my macaroni and cheese he naturally decided to eat all the rest of his chicken strips too. As he\u2019s chowing down on his strips I\u2019m pissed so I say \u201cOh no! You\u2019re eating Big Bird! He\u2019s dead!\u201d resulting in Ferris wailing as if I just informed him our dog died. My parents are FURIOUS with me and my dad had to take Ferris to the bathroom to calm him down. My mom immediately took my phone and I only just got it back last night while my dad decided to add onto the punishment after quite a lot of shouting at me and informed me I am not allowed to see my friends until next week. All this over a Sesame Street joke so yeah I\u2019m pretty pissed. When I spoke to a friend today at school she told me it was \u201ckinda b*tchy\u201d of me to do that and now I feel like I am going crazy, Aita here please Reddit?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I made a point to note it because they were making an argument in bad faith. \n\nYour reply, in this context is simply irrelevant. I'm really sorry that you wasted your time.", "OP is vegetarian - swapping the mac and cheese for the chicken wasn't an option. And even if it were, Ferris wanted and was allowed both meals. From the sounds of it, the 4 yo had about twice the amount of food as the 17 yo", "What word? Random? Toddler? Brother?", "That\u2019s not what random means. Like, at all.", "\"Christian\" Unimom. You are being intentionally obtuse. No one but you thinks you are being funny or cute. You're just choosing to die on a weird fucking hill right now.", "You really sound like a \u2018love thy neighbour\u2019 type of person\u2026", "Guess you didn't read where she said they told her to give him half, not ALL. You're ranting about nothing because you didn't read.", "Well chicken certainly doesn't come from his most beloved fictional character.", "I\u2019m the eldest sibling of five kids.", "Guess what, making one child go without food so you don\u2019t have to parent another child and punishing the first child for lashing out is also abusive! OP didn\u2019t set the shitty parenting precedent here and is herself a 17 year old product of this weird environment and these dysfunctional parents. \n\nExpecting her to have the self-awareness to be the bigger person or whatever is so bizarre, and frankly cruel.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable. I just think the parents pushed her to that point through their actions. OP was mean, but she isn\u2019t TA because she isn\u2019t the one ultimately at fault in this scenario. The parents lack of parenting is hurting their children.", "You people act like everyone can just push back against their parents with no risk of repercussion. She\u2019s seventeen, still lives under their roof, and they\u2019re clearly dysfunctional fools who would gladly punish her for their wrongdoings. It wasn\u2019t nice to lash out at her little brother, but that\u2019s the only power she really has. She\u2019s not TA in this situation, nor is the literal toddler, of course. It\u2019s the shit for brain parents who can\u2019t be bothered to parent. \n\nThey\u2019d already taken her somewhere with limited food options and were then urging her to give up half of what she was able to order. I\u2019d have been more pissed off than I was hungry by that point, too.", "So all your meat now is from the family farm? You don\u2019t eat at restaurants, at hotels, airports, work?", "To keep these stories going, my dad always said that people who farm dates make camels suck on them to give them that sort of glazed texture. It never worked on me but he insisted on saying it. Hell, i'm 21 and he still says it sometimes.", "*Worm God", "Oh, sorry, I was trying to respond to a different comment.", "Of a kid size Mac and cheese. They told her meal.", "So the solution is to bully a preschooler because she\u2019s upset with her parents?  That\u2019s horrible.", ">You people act like everyone can just push back against their parents with no risk of repercussion.\n\nThen yes, she should've just *SUCKED IT UP* instead of lashing out to the one person that has no fault in it because, again, he's a toddler! He doesn't know any better, but *SHE DOES*.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who doesn't even *LIKE KIDS*. OP's an a-hole, through and through.", "Better than bullying a four-year-old! Good god what is wrong with you?", "Not anymore; grandpa died, and the farm went with him, but I source locally and ethically *wherever I can*. Perfectionism is the enemy of productivity, and to pretend like it is something ANYONE can achieve is ignorant at best and utterly stupid at worst. My location helps a lot cost-wise, but I'm also not the kind of asshole who would shit on people just trying to survive so that I can feel superior for a few minutes. Not everyone can afford to make the choices I do.", "Read it. That's not what she wrote. Nothing they did justified how she treated an innocent FOUR year old child.", "So treating animals respectfully is nice, but not necessary, in order to justify eating them?", "Ok. That doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t taking her food away."]}
