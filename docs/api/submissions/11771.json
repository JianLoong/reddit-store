My sister on the other hand, she was gorgeous, she got all the attention growing up, all the compliments, and all i\u2019d get was \u201cyou\u2019ve grown\u201d \u201cwow you and you sister look to different \u201c, this took a huge toll on my mental health and it only took until middle school for boys in my year to start pointing out how unattractive i was. When i was 15 i finally had enough, i started dressing nicer, and started wearing make up by the boat load and i started to feel more confident and comfortable in myself. I went from hanging out with the weird kids to being in a semi- popular group that nobody had an issue with, but this didn\u2019t take away the pain or the damage that was already caused.\n\nAnd although people had began to notice the effort and actually started complimenting me, i still had a mindset that i could never be pretty. And the new look didn\u2019t stop my family from making jokes, my sister would always tell me that i was nothing without make up and my parents would feed into it. Most parents are supportive, but not mine. My mom would constantly tell me that my sister was still prettier than me and would always make comments on my weight like \u201cI\u2019ll give you the smaller portion, it\u2019ll do you some good\u201d and \u201care you sure you don\u2019t want me to sign you up for a gym?\u201d. My parents never respected me or had any empathy for me at all really.\nNow, i\u2019ve grown into my look pretty well and i often get compliments, but my mind will still forever be looking back on those comments wondering if I\u2019ll ever be good enough. My family still believe they\u2019ve done nothing wrong and whenever it\u2019s brought up they say \u201cit builds character \u201c in a sarcastic tone.\n\nWell, my moms birthday was on February 22nd and we had a big family dinner with all my aunties and uncles. My family began to give me and my sister the usual compliments, but just like old times my mom had to chime in and make comments about my sister being more naturally pretty than me, after 20 years i finally snapped, i broke down crying and got everything off my chest, years of depression and insecurity spilled out and i ended up saying things i didn\u2019t mean. Now let me be clear , this was just the breaking point, there were so many other things that i talked about, like them being physical with me and my sister as kids, and denying me therapy and so much more , but i wont go into detail. My mom just cried as everyone else starred in absolute horror.\n\nI left straight after and haven\u2019t returned calls from my parents since, my sister said i did what i needed to do to heal and is being surprisingly supportive, but my moms brother sent me a long paragraph about how i need to grow up ans can\u2019t just throw tantrums when something upsets me.

(God love her).  that\u2019s how Moms are supposed to be\n\ndespite the positive attention i got from men later, i was still extremely insecure and it hurts to look around and think all females are so much better than you. so i appreciate the painful place your reaction came from. apparently you had other issues from your childhood as well - and you clearly didn\u2019t plan for it all to come bubbling up at that moment.  \n\nbut it did and it\u2019s done and needed to be heard. but anyone who has an opinion other than immediate family - tell them - unless you grew up in this house - butt out. \n\nwhen your anger dissipates, you will need to discuss this with your family and have them validate that everything you said, while badly timed, was true - even if to them it was \u201cjust teasing\u201d. if you don\u2019t do that, eventually it\u2019ll be referred to as \u201cthat time you freaked out\u201d, as if you did it for no reason", "No, you are not AH. \nSome people don't have boundaries are parents, especially, should be more supportive.

You\u2019re not an asshole for what you did.\n\nI would recommend therapy for yourself and for your family as a group.

Nothing further. NTA.", "NTA. OP I\u2019m so sorry that your parents were abusive to you. And that\u2019s what it is by the way abuse.

That\u2019s extremely unusual and it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense why it gets brought up so often.\n\nThis story sounds fake to be honest. It\u2019s hard to believe that your physical appearance is something your parents would focus on this much. If the story isn\u2019t fake, then you need to get out of there ASAP.

It\u2019s not always easy to be sympathetic when you\u2019re in a position of privilege, but she seems to have the awareness that just because she\u2019s avoided your mom\u2019s wrath doesn\u2019t mean you deserve it. On the other hand, your mom and her brother are both major a-holes. Your mom is obviously an AH for her comments attempting to belittle ONE OF HER CHILDREN. That\u2019s self-explanatory. Your mom\u2019s brother is also an AH for having no sympathy for the fact that you\u2019ve put up with your mom\u2019s bull\u2014\u2014 for 20 years. This wasn\u2019t the \u201cdrama queen upset over minor incident\u201d that he\u2019s trying to portray it as. This was a lifetime\u2019s worth of belittlement, humiliation, and pain finally coming to the surface, and the fact that he either doesn\u2019t see that or chooses to ignore it is concerning.

You suffered decades of trauma and abuse, and you finally broke.  That would happen to anyone.  If you're not in therapy now, you really need to be, because that nasty little voice inside your head telling you that you'll never be good enough will not go away without professional help.  Also, go LC/NC with anyone who doesn't have your back.  Life is too short to put up with shitty people!", "NTA, this was just the last straw. I'm glad your sister is being supportive, and hopefully this will lead to a better relationship with your mother.", "NTA. Holy crap NTA. \n\nGrowing up, I was \u201cthe smart one\u201d and my sister was \u201cthe pretty one\u201d. My mother would always lament the fact that I couldn\u2019t \u201chave a nice figure like [my] sister\u201d. She also used to \u201cmoo\u201d (yes, like a cow) when I opened the fridge. On top of the emotional (and sometimes physical) abuse, this really fucked with my head. \n\nIt also spurned an interest in body image and now I\u2019m a psychologist and an expert on appearance investment. I really urge you to look into appearance investment - it\u2019s basically the degree to which we base our self-worth on appearance. Having high appearance investment is a risk factor for depression, anxiety disorders, suicidal ideation, eating disorders, substance use disorders\u2026 the list goes on.\n\nYour parents created an environment where appearance was valued above all else and put you at risk for all of the things I listed above. They failed at their job to raise healthy, happy children. *They* are the assholes here and all you did was highlight their failings. And if they didn\u2019t want to be perceived as shallow AH parents, they shouldn\u2019t have behaved as a such. \n\nOne last thing - it will take you years to unlearn those ingrained messages about appearance, but it can be done. Look into self-compassion.org and check out some of the info and practices on there. It will help you recognize that our appearance *does not* define our worth. We a worthy of love and compassion because we\u2019re *human*. Not because we\u2019re *pretty*. \n\nAnyway, look into it if you can. Self-compassion saved my life - I would have unalived myself if I hadn\u2019t learned to value myself unconditionally instead of weighing my value using a bathroom scale.", "The fact your sister supported you tells me you are NTA.\n\nYour uncle's opinion isn't relavent, he didn't live your life.", "There is also no time limit on these breakdowns.
