My sister on the other hand, she was gorgeous, she got all the attention growing up, all the compliments, and all i\u2019d get was \u201cyou\u2019ve grown\u201d \u201cwow you and you sister look to different \u201c, this took a huge toll on my mental health and it only took until middle school for boys in my year to start pointing out how unattractive i was. When i was 15 i finally had enough, i started dressing nicer, and started wearing make up by the boat load and i started to feel more confident and comfortable in myself. I went from hanging out with the weird kids to being in a semi- popular group that nobody had an issue with, but this didn\u2019t take away the pain or the damage that was already caused.\n\nAnd although people had began to notice the effort and actually started complimenting me, i still had a mindset that i could never be pretty. And the new look didn\u2019t stop my family from making jokes, my sister would always tell me that i was nothing without make up and my parents would feed into it. Most parents are supportive, but not mine. My mom would constantly tell me that my sister was still prettier than me and would always make comments on my weight like \u201cI\u2019ll give you the smaller portion, it\u2019ll do you some good\u201d and \u201care you sure you don\u2019t want me to sign you up for a gym?\u201d. My parents never respected me or had any empathy for me at all really.\nNow, i\u2019ve grown into my look pretty well and i often get compliments, but my mind will still forever be looking back on those comments wondering if I\u2019ll ever be good enough. My family still believe they\u2019ve done nothing wrong and whenever it\u2019s brought up they say \u201cit builds character \u201c in a sarcastic tone.\n\nWell, my moms birthday was on February 22nd and we had a big family dinner with all my aunties and uncles. My family began to give me and my sister the usual compliments, but just like old times my mom had to chime in and make comments about my sister being more naturally pretty than me, after 20 years i finally snapped, i broke down crying and got everything off my chest, years of depression and insecurity spilled out and i ended up saying things i didn\u2019t mean. Now let me be clear , this was just the breaking point, there were so many other things that i talked about, like them being physical with me and my sister as kids, and denying me therapy and so much more , but i wont go into detail. My mom just cried as everyone else starred in absolute horror.\n\nI left straight after and haven\u2019t returned calls from my parents since, my sister said i did what i needed to do to heal and is being surprisingly supportive, but my moms brother sent me a long paragraph about how i need to grow up ans can\u2019t just throw tantrums when something upsets me.

(God love her).  that\u2019s how Moms are supposed to be\n\ndespite the positive attention i got from men later, i was still extremely insecure and it hurts to look around and think all females are so much better than you. so i appreciate the painful place your reaction came from. apparently you had other issues from your childhood as well - and you clearly didn\u2019t plan for it all to come bubbling up at that moment.  \n\nbut it did and it\u2019s done and needed to be heard. but anyone who has an opinion other than immediate family - tell them - unless you grew up in this house - butt out. \n\nwhen your anger dissipates, you will need to discuss this with your family and have them validate that everything you said, while badly timed, was true - even if to them it was \u201cjust teasing\u201d. if you don\u2019t do that, eventually it\u2019ll be referred to as \u201cthat time you freaked out\u201d, as if you did it for no reason", "No, you are not AH. \nSome people don't have boundaries are parents, especially, should be more supportive.

She also had 20 years to figure out how unkind she was being to you. \n\nI\u2019m sure this sucks because you want loving supporting family, but you also want the bullshit to stop. You\u2019re not an asshole for what you did.\n\nI would recommend therapy for yourself and for your family as a group.

It sounds like an understandable reaction to a very unkind and unnecessary comment, which was the final straw after a lifetime of being put down by your parents, particularly your mother by the sound of it, and ritually humiliated in front of the extended family.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry there is so much unfairness, unkindness, and insensitivity in your family past. You held a lot of feelings in and you have the right to express yourself. I tend to think that if someone bullies or humiliates their target in public, then their target has the right to answer them back in public. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nTrauma doesn't see birthdays, you had to hold it all in for so many years and because it kept piling up, such an insensitive comment would surely cause an outburst.

Nothing further. NTA.", "NTA. OP I\u2019m so sorry that your parents were abusive to you. And that\u2019s what it is by the way abuse. They constantly undermined you through snide comments and insults and made unfair comparisons to your sister. Don\u2019t feel bad that you finally broke, they absolutely deserved it. You don\u2019t say if you were independent financially or not?

Good luck", "NTA, and I\u2019m sorry that you have to live in an environment where your sister\u2019s outward appearance is a regular topic of conversation. That\u2019s extremely unusual and it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense why it gets brought up so often.\n\nThis story sounds fake to be honest. It\u2019s hard to believe that your physical appearance is something your parents would focus on this much. If the story isn\u2019t fake, then you need to get out of there ASAP. Your family is shallow and extremely fucking weird. I promise that your appearance is fine, and it doesn\u2019t matter as much as they\u2019re making it out to seem.", "NTA", "Your whole first paragraph just represents so much that's wrong with society, seriously.\n\nFor me it'd be like:  \n\nWhen I was growing up I did schoolwork and played games and stuff.  Anyway, later, when I was 17 or so, I guess we reached the age when people worry about attractiveness, but most of my peer group didn't bother.\n\nI dunno if people \\_choose\\_ to worry about their attractiveness to potential mates at like the age of 14, or whether it's something people just get forced into, or what, but it seems like such a giant waste of time.\n\nNTA, anyway, well done for hitting back at your mother, sounds long overdue.", "Fake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not always easy to be sympathetic when you\u2019re in a position of privilege, but she seems to have the awareness that just because she\u2019s avoided your mom\u2019s wrath doesn\u2019t mean you deserve it. On the other hand, your mom and her brother are both major a-holes. Your mom is obviously an AH for her comments attempting to belittle ONE OF HER CHILDREN. That\u2019s self-explanatory. Your mom\u2019s brother is also an AH for having no sympathy for the fact that you\u2019ve put up with your mom\u2019s bull\u2014\u2014 for 20 years. This wasn\u2019t the \u201cdrama queen upset over minor incident\u201d that he\u2019s trying to portray it as. This was a lifetime\u2019s worth of belittlement, humiliation, and pain finally coming to the surface, and the fact that he either doesn\u2019t see that or chooses to ignore it is concerning.

You suffered decades of trauma and abuse, and you finally broke.  That would happen to anyone.  If you're not in therapy now, you really need to be, because that nasty little voice inside your head telling you that you'll never be good enough will not go away without professional help.  Also, go LC/NC with anyone who doesn't have your back.  Life is too short to put up with shitty people!", "NTA, this was just the last straw. I'm glad your sister is being supportive, and hopefully this will lead to a better relationship with your mother.", "NTA. Holy crap NTA. \n\nGrowing up, I was \u201cthe smart one\u201d and my sister was \u201cthe pretty one\u201d. My mother would always lament the fact that I couldn\u2019t \u201chave a nice figure like [my] sister\u201d. She also used to \u201cmoo\u201d (yes, like a cow) when I opened the fridge. On top of the emotional (and sometimes physical) abuse, this really fucked with my head. \n\nIt also spurned an interest in body image and now I\u2019m a psychologist and an expert on appearance investment. I really urge you to look into appearance investment - it\u2019s basically the degree to which we base our self-worth on appearance. Having high appearance investment is a risk factor for depression, anxiety disorders, suicidal ideation, eating disorders, substance use disorders\u2026 the list goes on.\n\nYour parents created an environment where appearance was valued above all else and put you at risk for all of the things I listed above. They failed at their job to raise healthy, happy children. *They* are the assholes here and all you did was highlight their failings. And if they didn\u2019t want to be perceived as shallow AH parents, they shouldn\u2019t have behaved as a such. \n\nOne last thing - it will take you years to unlearn those ingrained messages about appearance, but it can be done. Look into self-compassion.org and check out some of the info and practices on there. It will help you recognize that our appearance *does not* define our worth. We a worthy of love and compassion because we\u2019re *human*. Not because we\u2019re *pretty*. \n\nAnyway, look into it if you can. Self-compassion saved my life - I would have unalived myself if I hadn\u2019t learned to value myself unconditionally instead of weighing my value using a bathroom scale.", "The fact your sister supported you tells me you are NTA.\n\nYour uncle's opinion isn't relavent, he didn't live your life.", "There is also no time limit on these breakdowns.

Now, in my mid 30's having a small chest is awesome. My boobs haven't fallen victim to gravity like my large chested friends. I also peaked in my late twenties, so she was right about that, too. If you wanna know if I've told my mom she was right, I HAVE NOT AND REFUSE TO DO SO ON PRINCIPLE! \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I think that was a joke. As in ripping clothes, and then sewing them up", "NTA. Pretty much as soon as I finished the second paragraph I was like this chick can do whatever she wants at this party and still not be an asshole by comparison. \n\nUnlike your mother for you entire life, you weren\u2019t being rude. You weren\u2019t being malicious. You didn\u2019t *want* to hurt anyone. This wasn\u2019t a \u201ctantrum.\u201d You just finally broke. If your mother didn\u2019t want that to happen at her party, she should have shut the fuck up for a night. There\u2019s a very pretty \u201cBLOCK\u201d button with her name on it. Uncle too.", "NTA\n\nEmbrace the fact that your sister is supporting you.  I suspect (with no evidence, so just a hunch) that she may have been embarrassed for years by your parents' behavior.  And I say parents because this not only falls on your mom - your dad apparently refused to care one way or the other so he has to carry equal blame.\n\nAnd tell your uncle to butt out of your life and go NC with him - he's not worth it.", "You're the scapegoat in a family narcissistic system. Your sister is the golden child.\n\nYour parents have totally failed you. They will never change. They are too broken.\n\nYou are STRONG.\n\nPlease get therapy. My guess is you don't know how truly beautiful you are.\n\nNTA.", "YTA. Get therapy", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on being ready to speak out. I hope it's the start of a new stage in your life. \n\nPS, your parents et al are total assholes. Glad your sister is acting like a human.", "NTA \n\nI am so so sorry OP. This sounds incredibly traumatic, and I am very proud you finally were able to just let it all out after so many years. It sounds as if your sister is supporting you, and I hope you will heal and be able to maybe have a healthier relationship with her if you want. Whatever you choose forward just do it for you alone without accommodating anyone. You and your mental health comes first! \n\nLow contact, no contact, whatever you future relationship with your family might be, always know that good, trustworthy, and supportive friends and (future) SO can easily also be your chosen family <3 \n\nYou do you, heal, and do what makes you happy!", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are likely passing on some trauma from their life without realizing it. That isn't an excuse tho! It's good to see that your sister is now being supportive. Hopefully the adults can come around too. \nI think the outbreak was good (even if uncomfortable) going into the future. I'm impressed that you managed to improve yourself so much thru the years of that. I wish you the best of luck.", "YTA. You\u2019ve had plenty of time to say this but you chose to on her birthday at an event? You really need to grow up. You can recognize where the issues stem from but it\u2019s your responsibility to deal with them.", "I was the \"smart one\" and my sister was the \" pretty one\". I guess I just learned into being smart. I grew into my gangly body and parents got my teeth straightened, and I learned how to deal with my curly hair.\n\nMy sister dropped out of hs and married and had 4 kids pretty quickly. I went to college, met a guy who likes smart women.I have always been a person that has empathy. I have lots of friends and lovely children and grandchildren.\n\nOP should cut those toxic people out of her life. Pretty is what is inside. And I am glad her sister sees that she needed to unload. OP love your best life. I am sure you are lovely!", "You don't have to tell she's right.  Just tell her \"Thank you\" - she already knows she was right. :)", "NTA. Personally I'd cut off contact with all of them.", "I was an ugly duckling too, turned pretty in high school. I understand how u feel! For me, it wasn\u2019t hurtful family so much as 9 years of endlessly cruel classmates. Not only was I homely, I was super smart and they were academically way behind me. I got first fresh start by changing high schools, and was welcomed as an equal at the new school. Then had another fun leap forward when I went off to college, by then I was really pretty, so that was fun. Glad u left home and got a fresh start. Just enjoy your life now and by that I mean, ditch your mom! Living well is the best revenge!", "What kind of parent would even think of saying \"she was always naturally prettier . . .\" NYA", "NTA\u2014and congratulations for standing up for yourself. Fuck these people.", "Nta....been there and still going....i used to be jealousnof my brother and sister because i felt they got the good genes from my mom's side of the family and I was told you look like your grandmother(dad's mom)....and when i was in hs someone gave me a picture of her and I cried. I hid in my room and cried....I didn't want to look like her.\n\nPeople would tell me I looked like my mom and I would be like yeah ok whatever. I thought my mom was pretty even without her natural look makeup on. I never learned how to do makeup the way she did...it wasn't until my mom passed away and someone gifted my sibs and i a box full of pictures that I saw it. A picture of my mom around 4 or 5 years old. We looked like twins. She was more fair skinned than I was. But her 5yr old self and my 5 yr old self were twinning. That's when I started to decide to not care about my looks....\n\nIn your whole story the only one that actually heard you was your sister. Take it to heart. It seems like she's grown and the fact she acknowledged your pain and truth speaks volumes.", "NTA  Your mom's behavior is toxic on a good day.  Obviously she has been an abuser and still is by making hurful remarks about your appearance.", "NTA OP.  I have had some of the same issues, and I still do to an extent.  Don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.", "NTA- you have put up with that crap long enough.", "You need to go no contact babe. Get yourself into therapy, don\u2019t talk to anyone, cut them all out. You deserve better then this.", "NTA\n\nYou finally snapped after years of your mom's emotional abuse and you just couldn't take it anymore\n\nIt wasn't a tantrum i think they're all enablers who would want the victim to never speak up in the name of peace and if you do speak up it's rude,mean or as your uncle said a \"tantrum\"\n\nI'll go LC with parents and that uncle? Tell him he should be ashamed of himself for standing up for abusers", "People typically know when they're attractive and when they aren't. I know I'm not very attractive; I've been told so (told by other women that I need to start wearing makeup to look more attractive, by my father that I need to lose weight multiple times or nobody will want me) and I know from the fact that very, very few men ever look twice at me and have any interest in me at all. \"You're a good friend, but you're not attractive,\" as a couple of guys have said, in sum.\n\nYes, there are some conventionally attractive people who say they aren't attractive, but that usually comes from comparing themselves to others and hearing from others that they aren't attractive.", "Thank you both!
