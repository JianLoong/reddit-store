About 15 years ago when she was only 18 she married Steve, a horrible guy, 22 at the time (now M37). Steve grew up in a strict, neglectful household. He was taught things like fear = respect, and kids can only learn when they are beaten. It is obvious from the stories he shared that he has trauma, and he obviously carried that trauma to their family. Steve once shared that he was starved as a kid for acting up. This broke my heart. Unfortunately, Steve carried his Mother's ways of parenting to their baby girl (my niece) who is only 11. I've grown closer to my niece over the years and to her, I am just like a big sister, or a 'Cool Auntie.' Whenever I spend my money on my niece, even little things like a cute top, my BIL says she doesn't deserve to be 'spoiled' because she hasn't proved she deserves it. They've enrolled her in KUMON and she is at the top of her class. I haven't seen a girl who deserves it more. I've also noticed my sister changing a lot since her marriage with things like isolating herself from my family and deleting all social media. For a while, I lost all contact with my niece (she has no phone) but finally, I was able to get in touch with Steve and set up a time to have lunch with her. When my sister dropped my niece off at my apartment I noticed she no longer had her long beautiful hair. It was more like a bob now and it was extremely choppy. My sister left without a \"hello\" or even a smile. I sat my niece down and finally she started bawling. She explained to me that her Grandmother (Steve's mom) had told my sister to chop all of her hair off because her father found out about an innocent school crush she had developed. He went through her diary and being an 11-year-old girl she wrote the things she thought she could keep safe from her parents. Her father went to his mother and that's when her hair was chopped. I cannot imagine what this does to a little girl, so I decided to take her to get her hair fixed. Unfortunately, I didn't have the money to buy her extensions but I was able to get her to a good salon and I got her hair looking somewhat better. She was very thankful and felt pretty once again but then after I dropped her off I got tons of missed calls and texts from my sister and steve. They told me how it wasn't my place to touch her hair, I'm 'nosy' and it was supposed to be a lesson that she is too young to date boys and shouldn't be corrupted. I understand that she is not my child and I have no rights to her or her hair but what my sister and her husband did was extremely wrong. Did I take it too far? Should I have just kept my nose out of things?", "created_utc": 1667791157, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yob9j0/aita_for_fixing_my_nieces_hair_when_her_mother/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This kid is being emotionally and physically abused, and you are her only lifeline. Rarely have I seen better justification for violating the \"don't do the parenting job when you're not the parent\" rule.\n\nYou have no rights to her hair. But **she** has rights to her hair, and was happy with what you did with it.\n\nMy blood's boiling right now because of the life that this girl has to go back to. You're less likely to be able to see her in the near future because of her parents. Her mom is being controlled by her dad, but still.\n\nOh, sweetheart, NTA. Def N T A.", "NTA. Clearly this little girl needs someone on her side, and if her home situation is as bad as you described a wellness check might be in order.", "NTA. I'm so worried about your niece.", "NTA\n\nWhat your sisters family did is abuse. I would be documenting everything (date, time, incident, pictures, quotes from your niece). Do your best to stay in her life and be a safe space for her.  Something like this will happen again. I\u2019d be looking into ways to report this in your area.", "NTA.

They can\u2019t call you but they can check on her and contact the police.", "NTA they are abusive.", "NTA.

Please call CPS - this poor kid is being abused and needs a social worker ASAP to look into what\u2019s going on.", "What happened to your niece is despicable. She is lucky to have a great aunt like you.\n\nHave you called CPS? Have you told your parents or anyone else in your family? Maybe they can help get your sister and niece into a better situation.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.\n\nYour sister and Steve may want to have a row with you about it. Ideal line of argument: you're the aunt, it's not your place to teach or enforce lessons. If they want to cut you off, you can ask them if whether or not they want an adult whom their daughter will trust in their life. Reading her diary - an incredible violation of privacy - ensures she won't trust them. If conflict arises between her and her parents, you may be the one she'll willingly talk to. That might, might just get through to them.\n\nUltimately, you do not have control over whether she'll have the opportunity to keep in touch with you in the future. Which is unfortunate; her parents are being awful to her and you are being very kind. But even if they don't let her see you again while she's living in their house, it's not your fault. You're being kind and gracious to a child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Or if it will make the husband decide to make it even more difficult for you to see her - that would be awful. \nI hope you\u2019re able to stay in touch with her and get her help.

I fear for your sister but most especially for your niece.  \n\nGrandma is scary and you already know she's abusive - what else are they doing to this poor child?  \n\nPlease try to keep an eye on her as much as you can - more bad things are coming.", "NTA\n\nChildren need people to speak up and keep them safe when the people who should be protecting them are the danger.\n\nWhat is available to your niece depends a lot on where she lives as different countries have different laws and expectations. Where I currently live, there are local, state, and federal agencies who can be contacted. \n\nThere are different caseworkers who perform different types of tasks. One group does emergency type work - if the child being abused and needs to be removed from the home for their own protection. If there is no great immediate safety danger but still is not receiving adequate care, another type of caseworker takes on longer-term supervision while the child is still with their family. It just means someone is watching to make sure things are ok, and if not, they make sure the appropriate resources are available.\n\nYes, there will be mistakes where there will be too much or not enough intervention, but they do try to keep the children safe.", "NTA and call CPS. That child is unsafe and you know it. Screw making the family mad. This is how they react when she has a little crush? What more when they find out that a boy actually wants to date her when she's older? Get her outta there, keep her with you if possible just get her out of there", "These people will destroy this child if they can. \n\nYour niece will remember that you tried to help her for the rest of her life.\n\nSounds like CPS might need a little call. Anonymously, of course.\n\nEdit: NTA not one bit.", "NTA. And I am truly glad you weren't able to afford extensions, because while I don't know exactly how they work, I have no doubt that the two monsters this little one has for parents would have found a way to get them removed, and it would have been painful, both physically and emotionally. I can't express how awful they are, with the diary and their attitude of shaming her just for being interested in a boy. That grandmother is a monster. I think the best you can do right now is document what's going on. Just keep a record, NOT on social media, of things you're aware of. Once she starts puberty, I'm worried that her parents are going to escalate. If there's any possibility of CPS intervening, you will have names, dates, incidents, etc. Please don't go threatening your sister and her husband that you are watching them, or any such thing. Just be there.", "**NTA** \n\nSteve is repeating his family\u2019s abusive behaviour and you will never be out of line for helping an abused child. \n\nAs others have advised please call Child Protective Services and report them and rescue your niece.", "Yeah AND Steve\u2019s mom is parenting the grandkids!  Jfc", "Right? Exactly this. It's not about the hair, it's about treating a child like a human being who deserves respect and privacy. OP is doing that, her parents are not.", "Abuse is abuse. I can take a punch but don't hurt my feelings. \n\nOP, please help your neice if you can.", "Yes, I think about this periodically. The little physical abuse I experienced, which can sound pretty bad, elicits little emotion in my memory. The constant verbal abuse has made me a shell of a human being. \ud83d\ude43", "Are you able to save her from them? Can you report them to child services and then get custody of her? What they've done is terribly abusive. I think you acted the way anyone with common sense would have acted. You tried to make a bad situation better. I can see their point of view given their twisted logic. I would usually say getting someone else's child a haircut without informing the parent is a no-no but in this case you were helping the child feel better. You didn't call them and scream at them for what they'd done. You just got the kid a haircut. Civilized. Kind.", "OP not only are you not TA but you would absolutely be TA if you didn\u2019t call CPS or try to get custody of your niece she is being ABUSED you are her only lifeline and now after this they probably will make you see her less which sucks because you already didn\u2019t see her enough to begin with and this isn\u2019t about your sister I\u2019m sure she tries but that\u2019s not enough in this situation your sisters too scared to speak up for herself let alone her daughter she\u2019s a victim too but in this instance her negligence and fear has made her put her daughter in a position to have life lasting trauma you niece NEEDS OUT NOW this isn\u2019t even remotely a joke GET HER OUT either you do it or you call CPS to do it and this whole comments just based on the assumption of emotional abuse so if she is getting physically abused which she probably is too based on the description of your sisters boyfriends childhood the situation is even more dire so no you\u2019re NTA for fixing her hair but YTA for not getting her out or calling child services yet and your fear of shit being blown up or causing drama is selfish because your fear of your relationship with your sister going sour is outweighing your absolute responsibility to save this poor girl from real ABUSE", "NTA, you did not take things to far, you have to take things further IMO.\n\nCPS would be my first call, other relatives would be my second.", "NTA.

My parents would just straight up yanked my clothing till an arm or something ripped when I was younger if they didn't approve of the garment, I never had hair that they disapproved of then because I fear for what they'll do to my hair."]}
