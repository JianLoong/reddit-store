Everyone is excited, but here's the rub: two years ago, when I got married, she didn't attend my wedding. Her reason was financial constraints, which I understood, but it still hurt a lot, especially since she didn't make much effort to be involved in any other way.\n\nNow, I'm financially stable but still mindful about where I spend. Attending her wedding would cost a significant amount, and part of me feels like it's not worth the expense, given her absence at mine. When I mentioned possibly not going, she got upset and accused me of being petty and holding grudges.\n\nI value family and don't want to create more rifts, but I also feel like there's a principle at stake here. Am I the asshole for considering not going to her destination wedding?", "created_utc": 1704410098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yr51m/aita_for_not_attending_my_sisters_destination/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was really disappointed in how certain people behaved leading up to my wedding. It\u2019s still painful a few years later and every time I am involved in a wedding, those feelings inevitably get dragged back up. \n\nWhat I tell myself though is it\u2019s just one weekend. If I get upset about how I am perceiving that I am being treated, it could ruin a friendship forever. That\u2019s not really worth it for me.

Your feelings are valid. \n\nAnd also, is this worth deteriorating your relationship with her over?
