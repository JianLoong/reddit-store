His parents and siblings are always wanting to be around my daughter and spend time with her as she's all they have left of him and i've always encouraged this.\n\nWhen she was 6 my daughter was diagnosed with alopecia. She is now completely bald, we've tried wigs but she doesn't like them as they're itchy and too warm and we've tried a variety of synthetic and human hair wigs she just doesn't like them full stop and she's confident without them so that was fine with me, she has a variety of headscarves for when she wants to have something on her head but she often just rocks the bald look sometimes with a pretty headband on. Her paternal grandparents keep trying to push her to wear wigs and talk about how pretty it'd look but I always shut that down quickly as I don't want them getting in her head and wrecking her confidence. \n\nA family reunion for that side of the family is coming up with many relatives flying in for it and her grandmother bought her a pretty dress for it. She and her husband also told me they wanted her to wear a wig as it will look good for the pictures, they offered to pay for a \"nice\" wig and I immediately said no that we'd been over this and she doesn't like them but her Grandmother told me it was for one night and she could put up with it for one night even saying she'd buy her a Squishmallow if she did this for them. I told them they were not to make that offer and that if they felt that way my daughter wouldn't be going at all and I told them to take the dress back too as I didn't want them holding anything over us with this. \n\nMy daughter was a bit upset about losing a pretty dress she liked but I took her out for a Mummy/Daughter dress shopping day to get her a new one and we got ice cream too and she was quickly appeased over this. Her Grandmother has been texting me a lot over this trying to guilt trip me but i've been ignoring the texts for the most part, she even tried to say that my daughter could come in a headscarf but by this stage I am so disgusted by them that I don't want to take her at all and I don't trust them not to make snide comments.\n\nI do feel a bit of guilt as this is a moment my daughter could meet her extended family and I should maybe be teaching her to stand up to people and feel confident in her choices even if they are against it but I just feel like  this whole situation stinks.

Make an arrangement to see them before or after the reunion and explain why you are not in attendance but you would love to still see them.", "NTA, its really concerning how much they're pushing the wig thing, makes you wonder what they're saying behind your daughters back. It shows that they view her as inherently flawed, saying it'll look better in pictures, possibly so they dont have to explain it to others when they show family pictures. It's good that you're teaching your daughter to be confident, a lot of parents go for the \"do it so grandma/grandpa is happy\" route and the kids grow up never learning how to communicate boundaries. If she doesn't want to wear a wig she doesn't have to, that should be the end of the conversation.\n\nAlso the whole \"do a thing you dont want to do and I'll buy you something nice\" thing is the most toxic bullshit ever and makes for a hell load of fucked up adults later in life, believe me I speak from experience. If they arent nice to your child they shouldn't get to see her, she cant be bought.", "NTA\n\nI would text grandma back, I am so sorry that you do not love your granddaughter for who she is. Her medical problem is obviously embarrassing to you and I am sorry that you are more concerned about appearances than your granddaughter's mental health.  \n\nI will sit my daughter down and explain to her that people like you are to be avoided because they care more about appearances than the reality of her medical situation. My daughter needs to learn to stand up to bullies like you and I thank you for providing my daughter with this learning opportunity. \n\nSee how grandma reacts to that... either she profusely apologises or appearances are really more important to her.", "Hard NTA\n\nIf the grandparents truly care and love her, they won\u2019t give a crap about the hair loss or a wig nor will they ever bring it up knowing it is hurtful to your daughter. Also using the grandmother\u2019s lousy excuse, it\u2019s only for 1 photo, why bother wearing a wig which is unbearable for her granddaughter whom she claimed to care and love. \n\nTime to pull a uno reverse to the grandmother and make her feel guilty about her crap behavior towards your daughter.", "NTA. That is disgusting. They are basically saying they are embarrassed of her without hair. Why in the hell does she need a wig for pictures? She should be able to be who she is.", "NTA.\n\nIt is awesome that as a 9 year old she is confident enough not to wear a wig just to fit in or conform.\n\nGood on you for standing your ground.", "NTA. Accept your child for who she is, all of her, or relinquish seeing her.\n\nYou\u2019re protecting your child. You sound like a great mom.", "NTA. You\u2019re being an amazing mom and a great advocate for her. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA! Your family needs to accept your daughter as she is! It\u2019s beautiful that you are allowing her the choice to not wear a wig in her everyday life if she doesn\u2019t want to! She SHOULD have that choice! And it\u2019s good that she can be comfortable in her own body, as is! If grown adults can\u2019t embrace her for that, is it THEIR LOSS! Definitely sad to miss out on the opportunity to meet extended family, but it would be worse for her to know that they would only accept her within certain parameters.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly,  after all the back and forth that's already gone down, I'd probably skip this reunion. Maybe then the grandparents will understand that next time when you say no wigs, you aren't fingers around. \n\nGood luck whatever you decide. Nice job sticking up for kiddo !", "NTA. Your daughter's grandparents are prioritizing their wants over their grandchild's needs.\n\nIf this was about your daughter's experience, they wouldn't be so obsessed with her appearance and dismissive of her comfort and feelings. \n\nHer grandparents only care about their experience and looking good to other people.\n\nYou don't want to risk your daughter being hurt by such selfish people. Don't feel guilty.", "Nta\nIn fact grandma might risk killing grand daughters self confidence by pushing her to wear a wig. It's literally the equivalent of telling her there is something wrong with her.", "NTA.  I would talk to her about what was going on, why you feel it is wrong, and why you are happy with her choices and proud of her confidence.  Let her have a basic understanding and take away the positive lessons.\n\nBut the family communication and infighting should be all you Mama Bear.  She's nine.  Model what you hope she might one day do on her own, but nobody punches down at your daughter.  If they sneak a negative word past you, put that contact on a serious time out.  She has enough to deal with and she's perfect.", "NTA-Family members that want to force your child to conform to their narrow minded standards by making her wear a wig when she\u2019s made it clear she won\u2019t wear one are absolutely the assholes here.", "NTA\n\nit's wonderful you're standing up for your daughter!\n\nMine wanted my legs broken and reset because I had a two inch gap between my knees.  I was 10....", "NTA, they will guilt trip her into the wig once she gets there.  She is a strong young lady.  Keep protecting her from them.  Let her know what they are saying about her condition and their demands that she has to have a wig on when she is around them.  She may be young and needs to know what is going on.", "NTA. Her grandparents really sound like AHs. Holy cow. \n\nDoes the rest of the family know about her condition? Do they seem likely to act like the grandparents? If so, don\u2019t go. \n\nHOWEVER. If they\u2019re likely to be supportive, go there, let your daughter wear whatever she wants, and be really passive-aggressive, telling people how amazing your daughter looks and how you\u2019re so glad she\u2019s comfortable and confident in her own skin. I get it, it sounds petty, but you\u2019ve got to nip this behavior in the bud. Make them look like AHs to the rest of the family if you can, just so that they don\u2019t do it again.\n\nWhatever you do, after the fact, you should tell them that their insistence on a wig that she is not comfortable wearing can impact their relationship with her in the future if they\u2019re not ready to accept whatever she is comfortable looking like. They\u2019re really attached to your daughter, right? Hopefully this knocks some sense into them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The grandparents are in the wrong, and you are a good Mom.", "NTA.  Maintaining her confidence is priority number 1.  They are putting you in an impossible situation by making it hard to trust that they building her up in the same way you are.  \n\nHonestly just follow your gut and keep putting your daughter first.", "NTA You're doing what you need to, to protect your daughter. While it's always good to start young teaching her to be strong and stand up for herself, this isn't the event to start.  This is family, and they're able to play the \"do it for the family card\" with her. I know adults who can't stand up to that. She'll eventually get comfortable being her own advocate, but in the meantime, you're doing great sticking up for her! It'll mean a whole lot to her that you let her be herself, while her grandparents thought she needed to change.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to protect your daughter from people who refuse to accept your daughter for the awesome kid she is.\nI think it's wonderful that she has such confidence and I believe that you have a lot to do with that.

You rock \ud83d\udc9f", "NTA\n\nBut please, take her along for all the reasons you list.

Normalize her being around her relatives au naturel and the grandparents will have to suck it up.", "NTA. There\u2019s alopecia in my family and I\u2019d prefer to be completely bald than patchy. Glad your daughter seems to be happy in herself.", "NTA. Meeting family is really nice, and if it's just the grandparents being awful it sounds like it's worth a shot to go and see how it goes. Def be ready to shut them down hard, though. You can always stay for a short time and leave if you get even a little uncomfortable", "Not all of them no, but a couple, I could perhaps manage to get the contact information of the others through them though. That's a good suggestion thank you!", "I agree, I really don't like it. They're very particular about appearances so I think it comes down to that and I do worry that they sometimes talk behind her back. I'd never push her to do something to make others happy especially not something about her own appearance all I care about is if she's confident and comfortable with how she looks. \n\nHonestly I felt sick at that suggestion, my daughter is obsessed with Squishmallows and a part of me worried she'd do it just to get a new one which is why I made it clear they were not to make that offer to her.", "This. Why won't people just understand that the kid's comfort and well-being should come first? Forcing her to wear a wig for a photo would just make her feel like something's wrong with her. NTA", "You seem like an amazing parent, I'm glad she has someone who'll always support her being herself! If you feel the family is getting to pushy I think there's nothing wrong with distancing yourself and your daughter a bit. If they care about her as much as they say they'll stop trying to control her appearance. Also your daughter might be a bit young now but at some point I'd explain this kind of situation to her because it sadly probably won't be the last time and she needs to know there's absolutely nothing wrong with her and it's others who are being judgemental. But I think you're doing everything right, she's lucky to have you!", "thank you, I'm trying my hardest but it's not easy i'll admit that. I grew up in care myself and that led to low confidence and self worth which is how I fell in with her father in the first place. I can't bring myself to regret it as I got her out of it but it's not a life i'd ever want for her, if not for her I doubt i'd have tried to get out of that situation. Now my only goal in life is to raise her to better and more confident than I was when I was younger.", "You've seen the way things can go wrong so I'm sure you'll reach your goals and she'll be confident and happy, keep standing your ground, dont cave to the family, be an example to her of how to set boundaries and what type of shit she doesn't have to take from anyone ever. Right now you're her superhero and she looks up to you. Maybe shave your hair in solidarity, maybe even go to the family event like that together, lots of ways to show and tell her that no ones opinion of her but her own matters and she is great the way she is and whoever doesnt appreciate her can leave. I truly wish you and her the best!", "Oh I shaved my hair when she began to lose hers to help her with the situation, I now keep it at a short pixie cut rather than fully shaved.", "Good on you!
