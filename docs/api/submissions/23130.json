But I don\u2019t want to because it means I pay a lot more. I make about double what he does (he makes $21/h ($40,000/year) and I make $76,000/year. After taxes he takes home around $2600/month and I take home $4600/month. \n\nThe issues comes when we need to move in together. He lives in a basement room in a not great neighborhood. Which is around $700 a month. I live currently with a roommate where we each pay $1300 a month(utilities included). I live in a nicer place with underground parking. My car isn\u2019t the best and it\u2019s very cold in winter so it has trouble starting if it\u2019s parked outside at night. \n\nThe other option if for me to move in with him in a basement suite but there\u2019s barely any light and my commute would go from 20 min to 50 min one way and it\u2019s just a lot. He also would have a much shorter commute by moving to were I\u2019m at now or nearby and we might be able to carpool to work. \n\nSo my bf can\u2019t afford $1300 a month so he wants to pay $900/month max. That means I have to pay $1700 for me for the same spot. Really we would most likely pick a place together but now rental prices are even higher so this is a low estimate since my place is a pretty good deal. \n\nSo I\u2019d have to pay $400/month more for a place to live with him and I don\u2019t want to. Rent already takes up way too much of my money and I want to save to buy an apartment. But we have been dating for 4 years and we both want to get married maybe in 2 year but neither of us want to do so without moving in together. He thinks I need to be more serious about the relationship and be willing to pay more so we can move the relationship forward. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair Im paying an extra $4800 a year (plus I\u2019d have to put up the damage deposit because he doesn\u2019t have much savings) just so WE can advance the relationship. We\u2019d had a lot of arguments about this back and forth and it\u2019s very frustrating because neither of us are willing to pay more. I don\u2019t know if this relationship has a future because paying more just to move in together isn\u2019t really something I want to do and he thinks I\u2019m selfish for not volunteering more of my money to do so. This has been an ongoing issue since like 2 years ago when we first wanted to move in together.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone, I realized I probably have to end it with him. The truth is Id probably have to be paying more for everything for the rest of our lives and I\u2019d rather be with someone I can go 50/50 with. We live in a HCOL area and his income is unlikely to go up. I don\u2019t think I can deal with essentially being the breadwinner. I want to buy apartment and I probably won\u2019t be able to if I pay $400 extra a month in rent rather than save it. People are going to think I\u2019m the asshole for ending a relationship on finances but those people probably have enough money these things aren\u2019t an issue for them.

Break up\n2. He looks for a higher paying job/more progression opportunities\n3. You rent somewhere in both your pay brackets in a poor location of poor quality\nThese are the only 3 fair options that I can see", "Are you aware that finances are one of the biggest reasons people get divorced? Money will destroy even the strongest relationships. \n\nYou are not an asshole for how you feel about this, but then you need to date someone else who makes more. If the gap between your incomes will always be this large, then you will always be paying more than he is for household bills.\n\nI went through this before, except I was the one who made less. He too didn't want to compromise on anything. I was living with my parents rent free and already 45 mins from my job. He wanted me to move even further away from my job so he could be closer to his. He also refused to split the bills by income. We broke up instead.", "But you have to understand those are your improvements. If he was more than happy living in a basement he could maybe care less about a nicer home (per say). You are very defensive for someone who says you want to find solutions. You seem to want things your way or the highway right now.\n\nLiving a little further may extend your commute to work but if you save on rent money then you can put that towards gas so it might even out wheat you are paying now or better yet you'll end up saving because he will pay more.", "Single mothers don\u2019t have husbands\u2026", ">Stay at home mothers don\u2019t pay for anything and their husbands do.\n\nAnd usually that's something they agree to do.

I make a lot less than you actually.\nIf you\u2019re single and you lose your job or are disabled, you\u2019re certainly homeless - while with him you could at least live in a poorer place, but with a roof over your head. Your logic doesn\u2019t add up, and I\u2019m honestly shocked by your brutal materialism.\n\nedit: typos", "It\u2019s not just extending my commute as you make it seem. He can live there since he\u2019s a guy. Living where he does will likely cause me to get mugged or r*ped. I\u2019ve been followed when I was walking to the grocery store near his place. I think my safety is worth more than the money saved.", "Oops meant stay at home moms thanks for the catch", "Yeah but to break up a good relationship over a small manageable issue is so dumb. That was my original point. Everyone now just says \u201cuhh breakup\u201d or \u201cDIVORCE NOW\u201d like it\u2019s so dumb and toxic", "If it\u2019s materialistic to not want to live in a basement, in a shitty part of town that\u2019s dangerous and not have to commute an hour each way to work.

He won\u2019t get another job and you won\u2019t pay more.  You are both comfortable and therefore no longer compatible.", "NAH, if you love your money MORE than your BF, then move on.

Most people that make decent money want a partner that does also.", "Break up you don't love him .", "Find someone who is financially evenly yoked or bite the bullet and pay more. Those are the only ways I see in this scenario", "NAH. You've been together for four years, it's clear you understand the difference in financial standings, and you don't see him as being \"worth\" covering more of the costs despite the ability to do so  That's fine, it's your call, but it's silly not to see this as you bring half out the door.\n\nEvery couple is different, but for my wife and I (and when we were dating), there was an implicit understanding that whoever was making more covers more of the expenses. We both contribute what we're reasonably able to.", "I don\u2019t think this is fair. What OP is valuing is her future. She wants to more secure.

She doesn\u2019t want to take a financial hit to support her boyfriend, and decrease her future plans so she is a gold digger? Lol \n\nIf he is serious about their future, then he should look for another job where he can meet her halfway then. He just expects her to pay way more for the privilege of having him on his house. And op said that he will probably never increase his income so it will be up to her the sole responsibility. And he is a slob so he will not do a bigger share of chores\u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone with a brain would see a future in this case\n\nMoney is the biggest reason why people divorce. Love is beautiful but a good relationship doesn\u2019t last solely on this. This is actually a very immature view\u2026", "'A little further'.  How much do you think 'a little further' would be for this drop in rent prices?   Far enough and then you start incurring heavier commuting costs in time and money.", "Isn't that the arrangement women try get most men into?", "> Why on earth would anyone agree to that?\n\nPeople make financial concessions for people they love all the time. It's not exactly uncommon. \n\nOP doesn't want to do that, that's her right to choose so, but they're at an impasse.

You've gone from wanting to get married in the next two years, to ending a relationship because you don't want to pay more in rent a month. It's simply not love, if you guys truly were meant to be, this wouldn't be an issue, you would figure it out.", "Financial incompatibility is not a small issue in a relationship. Financial troubles are THE biggest issue in most relationships. The fact that his income will not increase in the future, and he wants to improve his life, and get married and such, he is putting the financial burden solely on her shoulders. And the fact that she wants to improve her life, maybe buy a place in the future, make them incompatible.\n\nPs, stay at home moms don\u2019t have outside income, but they provide childcare, they cook and clean, this is a 24h job. If the husband would pay for a professional to do all those thing, they would pay a lot of money.
