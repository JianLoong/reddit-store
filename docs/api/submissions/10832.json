{"id": 10832, "submission_id": "11b1v8e", "title": "AITA for wanting my money back?", "selftext": "So one of my friends Brittany decided to have a weekend getaway for her 30th birthday . 11 of us split the cost of a rental, long story short there were issues with our stay and she received a full refund on her credit card the following month. \n\nBrittany asked us if she could pay us all back later as they did not expect having to refund anyone and that instead of putting the cash we all paid her for the rental on their credit card they had spent it. \n\nMost of us agreed and were understanding. A few of the girls torched their relationship with her over the request for an extension but the majority remained patient. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a minuscule amount of money. All together Brittany received over 3.5k refund. \n\nThis is where it gets extra uncomfortable. Come December I had already written the refund off and that I wasn\u2019t going to ever see that money again.. but she sends out a lengthy text explaining how it was her husbands fault and that she wouldn\u2019t do that to us and ultimately guilt tripping (gaslighting) anyone who felt negative feelings about not receiving the refund. She asked anyone who hadn\u2019t received the refund to text her and that he would pay everyone on the 15th. She completely threw her husband under the bus. Not to mention I am not sure but I speculate no one had been paid and this text felt very manipulative. \n\nSo I texted her to let her know I hadn\u2019t received it, she said he would send it asap. December 30th I asked her if he had sent it she said that he forgot and would send it January 1st and if not then, February. Jan 1st- nothing. She then sends another text a few weeks later asking if I\u2019d like her to go ahead and send the money for a mutual friend\u2019s bachelorette party with the refund but I tell her no I am not collecting the money for the bachelorette yet that she could just send the refund. Nothing. \n\nTHEN she announces on social media her and her husband are taking a trip to EUROPE for TWO weeks. I\u2019m so annoyed. February 1st passes and I messaged her on the 15th asking to be paid. Same rigamarole. She\u2019s says I\u2019ll get it the next day, nothing. I message her and ask her to remind her husband. She says that she would and then she gives me another date the 28th of February. \n\nI don\u2019t plan to let it go. I feel so manipulated and like a real friend wouldn\u2019t behave this way. You can\u2019t steal over 3.5k of other peoples money and expect them to be ok with it. \n\nSo I\u2019m asking AITA if I continue to ask or torch my relationship with her over this? \n\n-side note she told me her husband didn\u2019t feel anyone deserved the money back because it was her 30th birthday.", "created_utc": 1677272239, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11b1v8e/aita_for_wanting_my_money_back/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
