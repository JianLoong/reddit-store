It's as if people don't realize that pretty much everyone ended up having at least 3 or 4 standard drinks over the course of a day for most of human history because the water would make you sick, so they drank watered down beer or watered down wine. Maybe they weren't *drunk* at any point, but it was a steady intake throughout the day - any time they were thirsty.\n\nHell, these days there are people out there who will say you are in fact an alcoholic if you typically have one or two glasses of wine with dinner.

Otherwise you are both likely to develop increased resentment towards the other.   \n\n\nI think the reasonable solution is for her to seek help to address her issues, rather than expect you to just give up something that you enjoy.

There's a stigma against drinking alone cause ppl assume it must be because you're miserable or doing it \"for no reason\", but if you're fairly introverted being alone or having a quiet cozy evening at home isn't miserable at all.\n\nWhile ppl do tend to over-estimate the 'safe' amount of booze (even if you're not addicted per se, drinking every day or even half the days in the week might screw up your liver, as might binging every weekend), there is a difference even between unhealthy habits & addiction. A lot of what people believe about addiction is wrong, most people who drink or even use substances don't get addicted.\n\nAddicts usually are one of these:\n\n* were abused as a child\n* poor or living under degrading circumstances\n* unmedicated mental health issue or chronic pain\n\nSo the addiction is *secondary* to an underlying problem.\n\nI'd worry about addiction if:\n\n* you can't do a normal task without the substance. eg. you always rely on it to clean, relax, work or socialize\n* You have a pattern of using it to cope or when in a bad mood (everyone's gotten trashed once after a breakup or stressful day, but if *any* time you're stressed you reach for booze or drugs, not good. )\n* you keep using large amounts with diminishing returns \n* it gets in the way of everyday tasks or eats into your budget\n\nAs you see, this doesn't apply to your situation at all.", "NTA.

You have to drink substantially more for a long period of time to become *alcoholic*. \n\nThere's a big difference between *drinking the recommended amount (or even more than it)* and *being physically dependent on and psychologically addicted to alcohol such that drinking is negatively affecting your life*.", "It really does NOT \"happen so fast\". That isn't how alcoholism works.  \n\nWhat you may need to do is talk to her and get her to dig deeper about where she got this idea.  What is she BASING this on?  Because that would be the first step in figuring out how to counteract the authority of the source.  \n\nLike, yeah, this one thing is super annoying of her.  But there's also this underlying issue that you and she need to take care of: her conviction about something medical, that she is completely wrong about, and in all this time she has not even thought about trying to find information that either supports her stance, or proves her stance is wrong.    This is a problem that a LOT of people get into, and it can lead to much worse medical decisions based on incorrect information.  It's also not great if she is so mentally inflexible that she would rather hold onto this idea that she has come to believe, rather than find out whether it's right or wrong, and change her thinking accordingly.\n\nIt's not always easy to work with someone who is clinging to a wrong idea, either.  The thing is, I'm completely sure that you could do some searches on the internet, and you could find \"sources\" that would support what your gf is saying.  Those sources too would be wrong.  But it demonstrates the problem of telling people to \"research\" something, if they don't also have the ability to recognize whether they've found a source that is good, or not. \n\nFor example, I'm absolutely sure there are tons of blog posts out there saying something like this; but who are those posts written by?  There are some people who will read a blog post on the internet and, because the person writes with absolute conviction, will think that they must know what they're talking about.  There are a lot of reasons why people post things on the internet in which they sound absolutely sure of what they're writing.  There are plenty of reasons that people can take a hard stance on the idea of consuming alcohol, and you'd have to look into where that person is coming from. (Which isn't always obvious.)    Is it a religious conviction?  Are they using quasi-medical language (the dangers of addiction) in order to make their position sound more authoritative?  And so on.\n\nSo the challenge is to figure out what source she WOULD accept as authoritative, and then you'd have to find such a source that you can be pretty sure doesn't already have an anti-alcohol agenda for some other reason. Here I'm thinking of doctors -- but not all doctors are unbiased, so you'd need to find a medical source that you know is reliable.  \n\nWould she accept a statement from YOUR doctor?  From HER doctor?  (You, of course, know your own doctor better than you know hers, probably.  You'd have to be sure that her doctor is reliable.)  Would she accept an article ?  Can you find a reliable publication that she'd accept as a source?\n\nYou basically need to address two issues there.  One is, what factors put a person at risk for alcoholism, or even alcohol abuse (short of actual alcoholism).  And second, what amount of casual drinking (\\*no matter where you do it\\*) is generally considered \"okay\" by doctors or therapists?  Like, you want to prove to her that your drinking habits (as you've described them here) are normal and that no doctor would consider it alarming.  But, you also need her to understand that she's got \"alcoholism\" and \"alcohol abuse\" completely wrong, and she's misapplying them.\n\n(Sidebar, but I'm stuck on the idea that she's fine with both of you drinking when you're out at a party or whatever, but somehow, it's 1 beer \\*at home\\* that is the \"danger\".  I mean, sure... people who are alcoholics or abusing alcohol will drink everywhere, including at home.  But I'm just bemused by what seems to be her idea that ANY drinking at home = the fast track to alcoholism.  In any venue, it's more about the behavior that can be observed with regard to your alcohol consumption, than the location per se.  Like, she would have much more grounds for concern if you went out to drink several times a week and got blackout-drunk every time.  And sure, if you came home every night and drank a six-pack of beer and got blackout drunk, that would definitely be alarming!  But that's not what you're doing, and I'm just stuck on her inability to recognize or judge the specifics of a situation.)\n\nAnyway, if she won't listen to ANY authorities that contradict her about this idea, then that is a further cause for concern.  It would suggest that something deeper is going on there, and at that point I'd almost suggest therapy -- individual, or couples -- to get at why this particular subject is something she's latched onto so strongly, with such a level of incorrect understanding.\n\nGood luck to you!  The thing is, in a general sense, it's good for both people in a couple to be looking out for habits that are concerning.  But that requires actually knowing WHAT to look for.  She's not doing any good to you, if she doesn't know the difference between normal, harmless behavior, and behavior that could actually potentially be harmful.", "Mate, you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone who has repeated tantrums because you... have a fucking beer Friday night?", "You know what else happens quickly?

My mum was an alcoholic for over 10 years. Back then it just started with one or two glasses of sparkling wine on the weekends with my grandma and aunt. Not much, right... But it became a custom, doing it every week together. And after some months she started drinking a glass here and there on weekdays at home alone, too. Then more. Then every day, until she drank one whole bottle per day and sometimes even more. At some point my dad didn't buy any of his wines anymore because she secretly drank it. So it started slow and grew in the course of 8-12 months. It was too late to stop it/her or help her when we finally realized that there's a problem, actually BECAUSE it went so slow - and then she was already addicted. It was such a hard battle afterwards. She never admitted that she had a problem and it destroyed a whole lot of friendships, her marriage and even her relationship with us, her kids, for a while. There's also other repercussions she has to live with until the end of her life now.\n\nAnyway, I don't think your gf is controlling - I think she's just (maybe overly) worried because drinking is unfortunately a big problem in Germany and Austria (I'm Austrian), with a lot of (smaller and bigger) alcoholics in our countries. I'm pretty sure she doesn't think you're an alcoholic now, but is just really scared you might become one one day, because for her alcohol is not so usual and she can't understand the wanting for it.\nMaybe a calm conversation might help here, talking about some thresholds that you two could abide to (like as soon as you drink at home on weekdays, or get drunk most of the weekends, she may say something).\nIf she likes eating sweets, you could try to explain that she also likes her chocolate or whatever and explain it like that :) \nAnyway, good luck - I hope you find a good solution :)", "Wait, so you said you sometimes get a drink on your own in the evening.
