There has been a lot of petty drama with my SIL, BIL, and MIL over the years but overall we have remained amicable enough to continue to  talk/ attend family functions. \n\nHowever currently I\u2019m not speaking with BIL for very good reason,(context below). I recently invited my in-laws (except BIL) to come to our house for a separate Christmas. \n\nMy in-laws replied that they did not want a party or a dinner because they do not feel comfortable around me since I\u2019m unwilling to see BIL.

They said they would only stop by to exchange presents and leave.  This made me angry so I told them if they don\u2019t want to visit with us then to forget the whole thing bc presents isn\u2019t what it\u2019s about, gifts are just clutter.  Now I\u2019m being cast as the villain for canceling Christmas. \n\nContext around BIL:\nSince New Year\u2019s Eve I have now refused to see or talk to my BIL until I feel he has gotten treatment and demonstrated mental stability.

He then went up to his room came back down with a gun we didn\u2019t know he had and threatened my husband with it. To my terror, my husband bleeding profusely from his head \u2018called his bluff\u2019 and said \u201cwhat are you going to shoot me? Just shoot me then?\u201d.  BIL ran up the driveway, standing about 5 feet from me held the gun to his own temple and then simultaneously screamed, pulled down gun firing 3 shots into the ground. He fled. The police stormtroopered through my whole house including the nursery.   \n\nI have cut all contact with him (also for my son).

This is so far beyond Reddit\u2019s pay grade, this needs legal advice and possibly intervention to resolve. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d cut off anyone who supports or enables such violence. No if, no buts. I don\u2019t want to associate with anyone who thinks that\u2019s acceptable behaviour.\n\nI don\u2019t blame your stance OP, you should protect your family.", "Ooh boy NTA . I would be going NC with the rest of the family  if they are going to continue enabling this behaviour. He has physically attacked your husband twice, once pulling a gun on him. I absolutely would never let that man back in my house.", "NTA.  This guy has assaulted and seriously injured your husband, and pulled a gun on him!  And the family takes his side???  This is what we call collusion, and it undermines any chance of this sick, dangerous guy getting any treatment whatsoever.  Question:  Why wasn't he arrested and charged for the assaults?  Your husband was bleeding and threatened with a gun.  If this is the U.S., you're looking at felonies.  If your husband let his brother get away with this dangerous, dangerous criminal behavior, he's part of the problem too.  So no, no contact.  Not now, and maybe not ever.  No efforts to reconcile.  And if the statute of limitations isn't passed, file some damned charges.  Swear out a criminal complaint.  Behavior has consequences.  Don't tolerate being victimized.  And if your husband weakens and starts hanging out or inviting his brother over, grab your kid and run.", "Yeah, that would be a big no contact in my book.

This sort of situation is how people end up dead. Your in laws must be fucking insane if they think you\u2019re going to just let this slide!

And not no but HELL NO to letting this man within 100 feet of you. You need a restraining order, and he needs to be in the mental hospital or the jail. I am a DV survivor, so I know that you all probably have a good bit of PTSD. So sorry you experienced this. Have Christmas with your husband and child, and block all of them.", "Omg NTA and please tell your husband to cut contact now this is not normal behavior. The in laws are awful for making excuses for BIL.", "NTA - you made a reasonable boundary to refuse contact with somebody who has demonstrated more than once that they are a threat you yourself, your husband and your home and child.\n\nThe family support him over you and clearly normalise his volatility and violence - that\u2019s something that they\u2019re going to have to learn the consequences of the hard way (noting that none of *them* offered to take your BIL in when he was in mayhem mode).\n\nYou should have talked to your husband about excluding the rest of the family but it sounds like he has grown up with this kind of drama being \u201cnormal\u201d and just to be expected and doesn\u2019t have a very healthy perspective on the dynamics in his birth family. You and he should probably seek counselling together over that so he can get an outside perspective on his expectations of violent behaviour; even if you had talked to your husband first, you are still right to lay down boundaries for your own safety.", "NTA and I\u2019d point out to your in laws they clearly care more about BIL than your husband\u2019s life and say good riddance. They aren\u2019t worth the energy if they are going to enable that behavior by not requiring him to get some actual mental health help. NTA at all. \n\nAlso NTA for calling gifts clutter. I absolutely agree, people mean well but often don\u2019t prioritize the types of gifts you may actually appreciate. I prefer time with people, experiences, or consumables. I\u2019d be more happy getting a loaf of a favorite homemade bread than a candle or some generic artwork.", "NTA Good God! I'm so sorry you went through all of that, truly. That's terrifying.", "NTA. OP, you are right to cut ties with him. He\u2019s not a safe person, and your family\u2019s well being comes first. He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t file charges against him. I damn sure would have. \n\nPart of his problem is likely his enabling family that makes excuses for his violent behavior. Until he gets some intensive treatment and the family gets therapy, I\u2019d stay away from all of them.", "About your BIL, you're right that you're absolutely no AH for avoiding him, and he should probably be under enforced treatment, andyour inlaws seem to treat it as no big deal.\n\nBut you extended an invitation to your inlaws with a condition, no problem, they declined, also no problem. They'd like to do a gift exchange, and you go rabid. Seems like a perfectly natural occurence for someone who's not opening gifts together. If you don't want to give and receive gifts, no worries, you should talk that over with your husband, and make a no-gifts agreement with people well ahead of time, but this honestly sounds to me like your version of flipping a table over.\n\n*Edit after response:*  I appreciate the elaboration, there was a lot more discussion and pressure from them than it looked like, judging by your response. You seem to have been trying your best to keep contact with the less violent people, but they're not having it. Keep looking out for the sensible people in your lives, it doesn't sound worth the trouble. Switching to NTA.", "Is your BIL getting a divorce due to domestic abuse accusations?

Keep your boundaries strong & never let these people back into your home. I'd move as far as possible to never see such toxicity ever again.

Your kid is going to become another statistic.", "Info: Why the hell is not your BIL in jail or a psychiatric ward?", "We did not involve the police with the stairs incident. The neighbors called the police on New Years and he was arrested and spent 30 days in jail for violating probation. (He was on probation for falsifying something at dmv).  My husband refused to give a witness statement.  I gave one but I wasn\u2019t present for the throwing things as I had gone to bed.  The chaos woke me up and I saw my husband bleeding from the head and he told me what was thrown at him. Then the gun confrontation happened but the gun was in his pocket but he apparently told my husband \u201care you sure you want to say that- I have a gun in my pocket\u201d and cocked the gun. Initially when he ran down the driveway I ran after him bc I was concerned about drunk driving.  I didn\u2019t realize he had a gun until he put it to his head.  I only heard \u201c-in my pocket\u201d and my husband saying shoot me. It happened fast and it didn\u2019t register right away.  Partly bc of how shocking my husband looked covered in blood I think. \n\nAnyway, he pled out and got 3 years suspended sentence. Mostly bc my husband wouldn\u2019t talk.", "They tell me he\u2019s so much better now and I have to give him a chance but I do not believe he could possibly be at this point. We are just in the part of the cycle where he seems nice and charming. But I also think the reason they don\u2019t want to have a party with us without him is bc they worry it will upset him and I think reality is they know if he gets upset he might explode at them. (He has in the past it\u2019s not always me and my husband as the target).  So I feel like deep down they know he\u2019s not really better they just want to sweep it under the rug like they always do.", "NTA. They are supporting this behaviour repeatedly.

The rest of his family are enabling BIL, excusing his behaviour and saying he\u2019s changed?! Lol, they\u2019re trying to force you all to just sweep BILS extremely dangerous, violent behaviour under the carpet. It\u2019s insane.

I am a DV survivor from a previous relationship and the BIL situation reminds me of that very much bc it\u2019s a cycle where part of the time he\u2019s fun and charming and everyone gets sucked back in. Also how his rage is sudden happy one second and then a perceived slight and it\u2019s fury.  I actually got taken out of work and diagnosed with ptsd following this and I had intensive treatment in a partial program.  I have had more treatment than BIL who has only continued with once a week therapy (not a doctor) that he had even prior to the incident. They point to that and say he\u2019s working on himself and I can\u2019t be an armchair psychiatrist.  However I do not feel he could possibly be better right now.  There\u2019s not been enough treatment or time. So I\u2019m not buying it.  If he\u2019s acting better it\u2019s just the nice part of the cycle in my opinion.", "Yes. That\u2019s what I mean.  If you don\u2019t want to be around me I don\u2019t want anything.  My love language is quality time. I always plan parties and events and try to make experiences special and they know this. Saying no party is like a slap in my face. \n\nIn fact New Year\u2019s Eve I threw together bc BIL had a new gf and wanted a double date. The crystal platter was out bc I bought little desserts from a bakery.  I had made a charcuterie board and bought champagne and decorated and printed out a couple games from Pinterest.  I tried to make it fun and a good experience.  I always do.  It really felt more like a targeted insult to say no party to be honest.", "That was their position.  That I overreacted and flew off just bc they didn\u2019t want a party. But to be clear. I extended the invitation and they didn\u2019t decline they just told me \u201cWe will come by for an informal visit to exchange gifts. No dinner. No party.\u201d I asked why and they said they do not want to party without the BIL. And I said they party with him without us naming specific examples.  They said we are always invited to the events with the BIL but we choose not to come and I said so you\u2019re pressuring us to be around him or you\u2019re punishing us for not being around him. They denied. I said they should be willing to see their son and grandson without BIL as we did nothing wrong and my husband has felt isolated and hurt all year. They said they\u2019d come by for gifts just no dinner no party. No games or anything. I said if they are refusing to have fun without BIL then I don\u2019t want to have a tense awkward gift exchange so forget the whole thing. They told me I was being rude, I said they can accept or decline an invitation they can\u2019t tell me what to do in my house. I said clearly they decline. They said they aren\u2019t declining they just only want to do gifts and I should respect their feelings on the matter. I said we don\u2019t care about the gifts and I don\u2019t want more negative experiences in my life this year.   I said ok if I respect your feelings that you don\u2019t want a party, dinner, games, or to have fun without BIL and you respect my feelings of no gifts then.. there\u2019s nothing left.", "They divorced under unreconcilable  differences.  I do not think he struck her (not sure though) but I know they both threw things and broke things.  This is consistent with how he acts with us too with throwing bottles, flipping tables etc. Though he did push my husband down the stairs. \n\nI said that I\u2019m most worried about a murder suicide.  They act as if I\u2019m hysterical and overreacting.  After I told them what happened on new years they all told me \u201che would never hurt anybody\u201d.  And they dismissed me when I said he already has!  Their new refrain is he will never be able to redeem himself if I don\u2019t give him an opportunity. But I say it\u2019s too soon to even try, especially since his treatment has been so blatantly insufficient. But then I\u2019m accused of being an armchair psychiatrist.", "That would be grounds for divorce from me. His brother brought a gun into your home against your explicit demands, almost murdered him, could have shot your child, brought a swat team into the house, AND REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE?????? And wants to reintegrate w his family???? Your husband is showing ZERO concern over your and your child\u2019s life. I\u2019d divorce his ass asap. Let him be with his crazy family and you protect your child.", "OP do you NOT see this is a murder waiting to happen?  Who gives a \"f\" about feelings when actual lives are at stake?", "And honestly I'm seriously side eyeing your husband for putting his brother above the safety of his family.  This mentally unstable person has a gun, has threatened your husband with it TWICE and no one expects he'll eventually shoot someone????  Girl the moment I found out my husband didn't make that statement I would've left his ass....he has deliberately put you, your child and himself in danger all because  FaaMiLyyy!", " I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s a targeted insult by any means but I definitely see how it would feel that way and could be. To me it sounds like they don\u2019t want to spend time with you guys because you won\u2019t let BIL come, which after what he did it definitely sounds like he shouldn\u2019t be allowed in your home. Sometimes people can\u2019t see the harm and damage someone caused was their own fault and let them take accountability for it. My aunt-in-law was extremely toxic and refused to take accountability for things she did. It ended up damaging my relationship with my grandmother-in-law because she constantly made excuses for it and put her before everyone else even after she stole thousands worth of jewelry, tools, and collectibles from grandma and other people in the family. Grandma just couldn\u2019t see that people didn\u2019t want to be around the aunt because of her own behavior. People want to see what they want and ignore what they don\u2019t and anyone who wants to hold that person accountable is the bad guy. \n\nIt sounds like you BIL needs some serious help and his parents just don\u2019t want to see how bad it is. I\u2019d try not to take it personally, hold your family\u2019s boundaries, and put your family first. It\u2019s your in-law\u2019s choice to not meet you in the middle with VERY reasonable demands. BIL threatened to shoot your husband, that\u2019s not some little squabble and if they can\u2019t see that and understand why you\u2019re not allowing him in your home, then they also need help.", "Yeah it is fucking *bonkers* that BIL had a gun and husband was shouting \"go on, shoot me then!\" like the climax of an action thriller."]}
