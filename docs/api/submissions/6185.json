I find it totally unreasonable that your dad will not let you have a lock on the door to your room.

I suggest talking to your father and honestly telling him that you\u2019re not able to get a good nights sleep with the brother coming in and making a mess. Tell him it is this lack of sleep that\u2019s making it difficult to not resent the brother and be compassionate during waking hours. I believe you might be able to strike up a compromise here where if you\u2019re able to lock your room, you\u2019ll work on your compassion and find a way to accept your brother for who he is. It\u2019s just really hard to be kind when you\u2019re tired.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour step-brother being on the spectrum doesn't excuse your father and step-mother's horrendous parenting. Unfortunately, it seems to be pretty common for a child to be neglected and abused when parents overfocus on a sibling with significant needs.\n\nIs there a trusted adult at school you can talk to about this? A good friend's parents? I think you need some adult help for this one.\n\nI really wish you luck with this. No one should have to go through this nonsense--especially on the heels of a parenting dying.", "NTA.\n\nIt *is* creepy and inappropriate. You\u2018re allowed to speak up and call him out, otherwise there won\u2018t be any improvement.", "NTA - this is creepy. \n\nYour dad has fucked up big time here, you\u2019re 16 years old and are entitled to some privacy - waking up to your brother being in your room is too much. You need to get that lock back on your door.", "Start doing the same to your dad and his wife. Go into their room and move stuff around and wake them up. When they complain, repeat what they've told you about your step brother.\nOr, you could get a door wedge to slide under your door when asleep - it might stop him from getting in your room?\nNTA", "First of all, I am very sorry for the loss of your mom and hope you are well supported during your grieving process! As well as this very difficult situation.\n\nDefinitely NTA !!!! It is so frightening that he would come into your room and try to sit on you!\n\nThere is no way a 16yo ~~girl~~ (M or F - Still an issue !!) would not get any privacy, and autism or not, boundaries between siblings is mandatory !!! Your Father is a big AH ! I am so sorry.. Also, as your stepbrother has autism, does he have some sort of health support and maybe join an appointment to explain the situation and find a solution with a professional?\n\nAnd for now, if no locks, put a chair to block your door and if they say anything, just say that you are unable to sleep because of the inconvenience and it has an immense impact on your life and also grieving process\\~\n\nEdit: Oh misunderstanding on OP being a 16M", "Sorry about your mum. \n\nNTA. Your father and stepmum are gaslighting you into accepting behaviour that has been making you uncomfortable for a long time. The fact that your stepbrother\u2019s behaviour is attributable to his being on the spectrum is irrelevant - if it\u2019s making you uncomfortable and they\u2019re not willing to acknowledge that, that\u2019s simply not acceptable. \n\nIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking for the stepbrother to be kicked out of the house, you just want some peace and solitude, and you tried putting a lock on the door. Why did your father take it off? Did he give you a reason? Why does the stepbrother need to be in the room - presumably it\u2019s just you sleeping in there? Because by gaslighting you and refusing to even acknowledge your discomfort, they are clearly TA.", "I\u2019m so very sorry for your loss. You need your privacy and you need to feel safe. Your dad and stepmom are really dug in so I\u2019m not sure how you can convince them. Could a guidance counselor help mediate for you? I wish you luck in getting that lock!! NTA.", "NTA. This is such a tough situation. \n\nYou\u2019re being told to have compassion, but nobody is extending you the same courtesy. Also, wanting your own space doesn\u2019t demonstrate any lack of compassion. People need space from their siblings, autism or not. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you lost your mom.", "NTA. \n\nIt does not matter he is on the spectrum, he can be taught boundaries. Your father is fucking up massively by not allowing you autonomy and privacy in the matter.  Both he and step mom are fucking up by not teaching boundaries and privacy, this will only cause increased issues in the future.", "NTA.  His behavior is inappropriate and you have a right to privacy.  As other commenters have mentioned, maybe you could use a chair or other piece of furniture to block the door at night.", "So sorry about your mom. It\u2019s hard losing a parent. You\u2019re Nta here. Your dad and stepmom however, are big AHs. Just because josh is on the spectrum, boundaries and rules still apply to him. It\u2019s crazy to me that they enable him and condone his behavior like this. Have they lost their minds? My nephew is on the spectrum too and if he ever pulled any of this crap, he\u2019d be in timeout the rest of his life. That\u2019s severely bad parenting. You are a teenager, you are entitled to your privacy. And need your privacy! My mind is just totally blown rn.", "The OP is a 16yo male, and the stepbrother is an 8yo male. Obviously that doesn't invalidate his need for personal space, but it's definitely an important distinction.", "OP is male.", "OP, get a door stopper, one of the wedge ones, and stick under your door at night (assuming it opens into your room). It'll be at least harder for the kid to come in then", "I love this.  Treat them the same way he treats you.  It's even better if he follows you into their room!  \n\nThey are comfortable with him fixating on you because it means they have to spend less time with him.", "Well put! You have a right to your privacy. Autism is no excuse for not teaching the kid some boundaries. When he's an adult he can't do anything he wants either", "This, maybe show your dad this post. Nta. It\u2019s is really uncool and unfair that they are letting your stepbrother wake you at all hours and also not respect your stuff. Is there another living option if things don\u2019t change? Maybe if you make dads parents/siblings aware they can back you up?"]}
