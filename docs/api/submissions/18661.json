The worst part is that he invited them over. And basic cleaning before guests especially new ones is not ridiculous.", "NTA, what an entitled AH your hubs is. To invite people and let the partner do the work is the epitome of rudeness for me. Unless expressly agreed of course.", "NTA\u2026 why does he even invite people\u2026", "NTA! Hell my husband will clean the bathrooms and buy food and booze if company is coming over. I do the never ending pile of dishes and the kids tidy their living room messes and vacuum. It\u2019s a team effort. Your husband is the AH and a lazy, clueless one at that.", "NTA - that was a totally reasonable request and it\u2019s important that both parties are willing to compromise to meet each other\u2019s needs. It sounds like you\u2019re already compromising by hosting last minute on a weeknight, and it\u2019s totally valid for you to want to provide a certain level of hospitality to make the right impression. I think your husband should be more supportive of that, especially since it ultimately stems from your desire to make your guests feel more welcome and appreciated for bringing food.", "NTA... He invited them over AND they're bringing food. Kinda weird to not provide something, and if he didn't wanna spend the money one wine there are other options he could have suggested\n\nAlso deflecting \"we need to prepare for these last minute guests\" with \"I'll never invite anyone over again\" is a real shitty deflection on his part that I wouldn't personally let slide", "NTA, but your husband is\n\nYou should be mutually agreeing to have people over rather than him \"informing\" you\n\nIt sounds like you are a good host and happy to have people over with enough notice\n\nYou are absolutely right that them bringing the food makes it even more understandable that you expect to be able to provide the drinks\n\nYou guys should go to couples therapy. He seems like the type to refuse because he doesn't want you to realize how toxic his behavior actually is\n\nGood luck!", "NTA.  What is wrong with him? Of course you need to have something on hand to offer your guests, especially if they're bringing food!  If he doesn't want to spend money on wine, then he should buy beer or soda.   I don't know if mopping is necessary if the floors are generally clean, but I always do a quick clean up in the bathroom before people come over.  If he doesn't want to see you rushing around in the hour and a half between finishing work and guests showing up, then he shouldn't invite guests at the last minute.", "NTA. Your husband is though. He invites people at the last minute without even discussing it with you. Will not help you clean then refuses to get get wine", "NTA but there seems to be some bigger issues here", "He invited them but you were the one suggesting wine, so that's a tossup.  Alcohol is by no means an obligation.  (Also did you tell him why you wanted other wines?)\n\nIt's mostly NAH. His \"sit on the couch\" attitude is annoying (if there were minor tidying-up things he could have done) but it's just different standards for company.  He was going for no-effort casual.  You were going for casual clean.\n\nIf he threatens to stop inviting people last minute, take him up on it.", "NAH:  I think you and your husband just have different views on company. I'm more like your husband. When my friends come over, there's no need to go all out, clean, and all that jazz. There's no need to impress them. \n\nAt the same time, you're a great host, and there's nothing wrong with that.", "NAH. In his mind, maybe the three bottles of wine were diverse enough. In yours (and mine TBH) they aren\u2019t good enough. But seems more like a slight difference in expectations more than anything.", "ESH\n\nI can see sweeping and running a toilet brush in the guest bathroom but the rest seems like over kill. Shouldn't need a mop unless you don't clean up after you drip the floor and don't clean the toilet regularly??\n\nAs for the wine, tell him when he invites someone over to ASK them what they want to drink and that he should pick it up on the way home. If you know what is needed it wont be expensive. They may be pop, coffee, tea or bottled water drinkers and wine isn't needed. \n\nI think there is some blame on both sides here.", "I think you just have different philosophies in life.\n\nYour husby is like mine, doesn't care what the house looks like, just pop over whenever. \n\nYou sound a little more... uptight with having guests over last minute. Don't get me wrong, having clean toilet and sink in the guess bath is bare minimum for me as well lol. \n\nBut to suggest pizza, then make him go out because you don't have the 'right' wine is a bit contradictory. \n\nSo YTA. Pizza and whatever beverages you have on hand is fine.", "NAH as long as it didn\u2019t escalate further.\n\nHowever, I think it would be a good idea to have a conversation about what it means to have company.

But, we all make compromises.", "How often is he springing shit on you and getting mad at how you react to it?", "Well to me mopping before friends coming over seems overboard but again I'm like the husband so I get it.  \n\nBut we both said the same thing. That neither of them are wrong they just think differently", "I respect that I just think differently. \n\nI mean I did saying don't think OP is wrong and she's not an asshole I just understand the husband position I'm like him. \n\nWon't lie I'm confused in what's wrong with me saying I just don't see either of them. Being an asshole but idk keep the downvotes coming", "Perhaps they don't draw the distinction between friends coming over to hang out and guests-who-are-not-friends? That's what I'm guessing.", "Yes because there are two sides here. \n\nThe husband and his friends, thats the side I was speaking on. \n\nThe other side is OP and people who are not her friends which all I said was she's not wrong and not an AH. \n\nI was simply speaking on the husband's side and being in his shoes. Which is why I mentioned friends. \n\nMain point is that OP did nothing wrong we agree on that at least", "Aren't you the one going around telling everybody this same message?  That's not you?  If not, then my bad.  But I thought I saw you posting this exact thing over and over in response.  I've responded once. To you.\n\nAnd nothing to respond about how his behavior is not supportive of his partner?  About how these people are strangers he invited over last minute and is doing nothing to make her more comfortable, in her own home, with these strangers so she can potentially do all that relaxing you keep telling everyone about?", "Sweet wines taste very bad with pizza. Its pretty customary, at least where I live in the US, to provide drinks if you have guests, unless stated otherwise.", "Three bottles of dessert wine, which is not really drinkable with dinner. Why can\u2019t he pop to the shop for some wine for his friends he invited over without notice?", "Haha, hey\u2026dumb takes deserve dumb metaphors. \ud83d\ude1c", "They\u2019re paying for the pizza and fetching it and bringing it over. OP is supposed to mooch their pizza and give them water?", "So you are arguing and dismissing people for sticking to a social code that you yourself stick to?  I\u2019m confused.", "Yeah I somehow suspected you didn\u2019t entertain much.", "It doesn't sound like they're necessarily friends. OP said they have never met the wife before, so this is still a relatively informal gathering.", "Whether you're intending to or not, all of your comments come across as if you don't understand the situation. You keep mentioning how you like to host your friends. Which is fine, I don't think anyone has a problem with that. However, it seems like you don't understand that these people are not OPs friends. The guy is a work acquaintance of the husband, and the wife is entirely unknown to OP. Perhaps they will be friends in the future, but they are not currently friends. Therefore, your comments about relaxing cleaning and hosting standards for friends are not exactly relevant to this exact situation. I didn't downvote you, I just didn't vote at all. But I suspect that is why people are downvoting you.", "Why should he? I mean, he absolutely can. Heck, he could go to the store and buy a $200 bottle of whiskey to share, and maybe some ice-cream for dessert.\n\nBut why should he have to? It's ok to just invite people over to relax and enjoy their company.", "Why couldn't they drink regular drinks with dinner then dessert wine later? Just cause he didn't want to buy wine doesn't mean they have no drinks in their home to go with dinner.", "I'm arguing about it because it's dumb and I'm convinced it's made-up pressure. I've never thought someone was being a \"bad host\" if I wasn't offered beverages. I've never even heard someone being judged for having a messy house. I've only ever heard people apologize for it.\n\nThis is a toilet seat situation. I shouldn't have to put the seat down, it's objectively more fair to let the person who needs to use set it up appropriately. But I'll never be able to convince a woman that this is true, so I just go along with it and lower it down every time. \n\nJust because something is wrong, doesn't mean it's worth the hassle to fight it in every day.", "Bazinga. \n\nIt doesn't HAVE to be \"entertaining\" It's possible to just spend time with people.", "Just curious how is it that I don't understand? I said she isn't wrong she's not an asshole. I just think like OP husband where it doesn't matter. Because it is relevant because I was putting myself in her husband's shoes not OPs. The reason being i relate to him and not her.", "Everyone acting like the wine had to be drank with the pizza. How about they could have chilled, drank regular drinks and moved on to wine later. Just cause dude doesn't want to but wine doesn't now mean his house is a barren wasteland with no access to any fluids.", "> regular drinks    \n   \nWine isn\u2019t a \u201cregular drink\u201d? Since when?", "Social norms become norms for a reason. Who wants to host a party and have someone ask for a drink and offer them tap water?  You are in the minority here I think. It\u2019s not made up, it\u2019s custom and based on the idea that you want people to feel at home in your home. You make it comfortable and clean and you offer them food and drink\n\nToilet seats are kept down because it looks better. Same reason beds are made. Same reason the lawn is mowed. There are reasons for everything Just because it\u2019s not important to you personally, doesn\u2019t mean people are dumb for wanting to follow them.", "NTA. Husband sounds like a bad host.", "You close the toilet seat to flush so you don\u2019t subject the bathroom to the piss spray tornado. And because no one wants to look at the nasty underside of the toilet seat. It\u2019s basic manners.", "Breaking News: Men can pee sitting down", "I don't want to be an asshole here, but I laid out pretty clearly what it seems like you don't understand. \n\nYour comments keep referring to FRIENDS. As in, how you don't clean up or have anything special on hand when FRIENDS visit. \n\nOP is talking about NOT FRIENDS. These people are NOT OP'S FRIENDS. So if they are NOT FRIENDS why did you make more than one comment about how you behave for FRIENDS? Your advice about how to act for FRIENDS is not relevant for NOT FRIENDS. \n\nIs that clear enough?", "It's not a party. Two people are coming over and bringing some pizza.\n\nA messy house is also comfortable.", "I did just say my comments I was putting myself in OP husband shoes mainly because the comment I responded to said \"why does he even invite people over\"  so I wasn't talking about OP I was speaking about the husband.  \n\nSo again I was speaking about OP I was speaking about thr husband sorry for any confusion"]}
