The worst part is that he invited them over. And basic cleaning before guests especially new ones is not ridiculous.", "NTA, what an entitled AH your hubs is. To invite people and let the partner do the work is the epitome of rudeness for me. Unless expressly agreed of course.", "NTA\u2026 why does he even invite people\u2026", "NTA! Hell my husband will clean the bathrooms and buy food and booze if company is coming over. I do the never ending pile of dishes and the kids tidy their living room messes and vacuum. It\u2019s a team effort. Your husband is the AH and a lazy, clueless one at that.", "NTA - that was a totally reasonable request and it\u2019s important that both parties are willing to compromise to meet each other\u2019s needs. It sounds like you\u2019re already compromising by hosting last minute on a weeknight, and it\u2019s totally valid for you to want to provide a certain level of hospitality to make the right impression. I think your husband should be more supportive of that, especially since it ultimately stems from your desire to make your guests feel more welcome and appreciated for bringing food.", "NTA... He invited them over AND they're bringing food. Kinda weird to not provide something, and if he didn't wanna spend the money one wine there are other options he could have suggested\n\nAlso deflecting \"we need to prepare for these last minute guests\" with \"I'll never invite anyone over again\" is a real shitty deflection on his part that I wouldn't personally let slide", "NTA, but your husband is\n\nYou should be mutually agreeing to have people over rather than him \"informing\" you\n\nIt sounds like you are a good host and happy to have people over with enough notice\n\nYou are absolutely right that them bringing the food makes it even more understandable that you expect to be able to provide the drinks\n\nYou guys should go to couples therapy. He seems like the type to refuse because he doesn't want you to realize how toxic his behavior actually is\n\nGood luck!", "NTA.  What is wrong with him? Of course you need to have something on hand to offer your guests, especially if they're bringing food!  If he doesn't want to spend money on wine, then he should buy beer or soda.   I don't know if mopping is necessary if the floors are generally clean, but I always do a quick clean up in the bathroom before people come over.  If he doesn't want to see you rushing around in the hour and a half between finishing work and guests showing up, then he shouldn't invite guests at the last minute.", "NTA. Your husband is though. He invites people at the last minute without even discussing it with you. Will not help you clean then refuses to get get wine", "NTA but there seems to be some bigger issues here", "He invited them but you were the one suggesting wine, so that's a tossup.  Alcohol is by no means an obligation.  (Also did you tell him why you wanted other wines?)\n\nIt's mostly NAH. His \"sit on the couch\" attitude is annoying (if there were minor tidying-up things he could have done) but it's just different standards for company.  He was going for no-effort casual.  You were going for casual clean.\n\nIf he threatens to stop inviting people last minute, take him up on it.", "NAH:  I think you and your husband just have different views on company. I'm more like your husband. When my friends come over, there's no need to go all out, clean, and all that jazz. There's no need to impress them. \n\nAt the same time, you're a great host, and there's nothing wrong with that.", "NAH. In his mind, maybe the three bottles of wine were diverse enough. In yours (and mine TBH) they aren\u2019t good enough. But seems more like a slight difference in expectations more than anything.", "ESH\n\nI can see sweeping and running a toilet brush in the guest bathroom but the rest seems like over kill. Shouldn't need a mop unless you don't clean up after you drip the floor and don't clean the toilet regularly??\n\nAs for the wine, tell him when he invites someone over to ASK them what they want to drink and that he should pick it up on the way home. If you know what is needed it wont be expensive. They may be pop, coffee, tea or bottled water drinkers and wine isn't needed. \n\nI think there is some blame on both sides here.", "I think you just have different philosophies in life.\n\nYour husby is like mine, doesn't care what the house looks like, just pop over whenever. \n\nYou sound a little more... uptight with having guests over last minute. Don't get me wrong, having clean toilet and sink in the guess bath is bare minimum for me as well lol. \n\nBut to suggest pizza, then make him go out because you don't have the 'right' wine is a bit contradictory. \n\nSo YTA. Pizza and whatever beverages you have on hand is fine.", "NAH as long as it didn\u2019t escalate further.\n\nHowever, I think it would be a good idea to have a conversation about what it means to have company.

He said you didn\u2019t need to clean, you chose to anyway and stress yourself out over it. That\u2019s on you. He told you the three bottles of wine you guys had was fine, you disregarded his input. He shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you but you didn\u2019t listen to any of his input and decided to take this gathering in your own hands. Wine is not something to be stressed or embarrassed about. It literally could have been Barefoot and it would have been fine. Take it for what it is: \u201cAn Impromptu Wine and pizza between two couples in their 20s\u201d.
