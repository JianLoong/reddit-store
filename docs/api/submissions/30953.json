She needs to.learn", "NTA\n\nIf that was me and my kid was staying up till 3am, I'd take their phone away. \nTurning off the WiFi is a great idea. My friends' parents used to do that, and it works. They knew to get their homework done by then, get done talking to their friends by then. If they used their data up, none till the next month. Easy. \n\nMy parents were old school and would pull the cord out for the wifi lol.", "NTA", "NTA. I don't know how you train a child who isn't required at some point to respect household rules? So, stop feeling guilty because you have to manage this child who is literally ignoring your basic expectations regarding her cell phone.\n\nJust help her out and impose some limits she's required to respect. I don't think that a 13-year-old *needs* to be up and on the phone at 2, or 3 A.M. So, you have my sympathy. Your kid does too. But, not to the point where I think you should keep negotiating with her. She's 13 - not 23.\n\nIf my child refused to follow house rules, she'd probably lose the privilege of having a cell phone for at least a month. Again, I believe at that age, the phone is a wonderful means of keeping us connected to our children. But its also something to be managed responsibly.\n\nI'd stop negotiating and she'd have a basic phone, (no Wi-Fi, no games, no music, no texting, etc., . . . ) for 3 months. But, I think loss of small privileges is effective at redirecting pubescents and helping them grow from mistakes into more responsible choices.", "Nta. Personally, my cut off time from electronics at her age was 10, I didn't get to 11 until I started highschool.\n\nHaving a phone in bed at any age, and especially engaging in conversations and using social media, is super overstimulating and can decrease quality of sleep, increase difficulty in falling asleep and affect her general quality of life in a negative way. You're doing what needs to be done, even if she does protest. But here's the thing, you're the parent. You gotta do what's best for your kid, no matter how much they whine about it.\n\nETA: on the topic of \"well all the kids are doing it\", on the risk of sounding like my mother, well if all the kids were jumping off a bridge, should she?\n\nAnd dad wants to be her friend, not her dad. He's failing her as a parent. You aren't. Parents aren't friends, they're guides and safe spaces, but never at the expense of the kids well being. He wants to be the cool fun dad so bad, and it is at the detriment of your daughter's health. So don't let him guilt you.", "NTA and 11pm is too late. \n\nIf she needs 8 hours sleep and gets up at 6.30am, she should be asleep at 10.30.\n\n Realistically she's not falling immediately asleep the minute you prise the phone from her hand. So a 9.30 or 10pm curfew on devices gives her time to wind down. \n\nDevices should be kept in a communal location not in her room after this time (otherwise she might play offline games).", "NTA it\u2019s just parenting. If she ignores your rules, I\u2019d also consider taking the phone for a few days once she\u2019s back from school. \nAnd every parent has to deal with phone addiction nowadays. Sucks.", "Take the phone away at 11 PM. Get her a sound machine/alarm for the room.", "NTA Kids should sleep, it's very important for their physical and mental health.

I would try to automate as much as possible though. There are some apps and you can put screen time limits. But honestly, being on antidepressants is excessive and you need to curb what is clearly addictive behaviour. Get her an alarm clock, and take the phone at 10pm.", "NTA 1) social media is the devil and will corrupt her young mind, I don\u2019t think she should be on it at all yet. \n\n2) I have a 12 year old that has a phone with access until midnight on weekends and no social media. \n\nWith a teen you HAVE to set firm boundaries and keep them or they will walk all over you. Sucks for now, but remember, you are their parent first and foremost.", "NTA, decent sleep is vital for a myriad of health reasons, your daughter has an addiction problem.", "NTA. Back in my high school days (going back approx 17 years now) my parents:\n\n- didn't let me have a phone until I was 15 (everyone else had one) \n- would unplug the internet router after a warning so we couldn't be online at all hours of the night\n- I got pre-paid phone data and once it was gone I wouldn't get anymore until the next 'due date'.\n- it was literally txt and call only so I could be in contact if I needed in case of emergency. \n\nI got by just fine and didn't start getting more late night freedom until I was 17 or 18. \n\nJust because the internet and stuff is available 24/7 now, doesn't mean it should be accessed 24/7. It's affecting her health and her parents need to do something about you. You're doing good by setting rules and her dad isn't helping her at all. He is being lazy.", "You need to speak to her father and make sure you\u2019re a united front to your daughter about this. \n\nTeens will be teens but she\u2019s literally getting health issues over this. He needs to understand how serious it\u2019s becoming. She cannot self regulate it. She\u2019s only 13. 13 is a very vital time for kids. She\u2019s very prone to being influenced and easily caught up in things. Unlimited access to the internet and everything is a scary thing. \n\nIt\u2019s your job as a parent to make sure she\u2019s protected, has a healthy relationship with social media and her phone/internet usage, and that she knows how to protect herself online from creeps as well. \n\nI grew up with the internet, i was once a frustrated teenager who just wanted to stay up and talk to friends but the older I get the more thankful I am for the age appropriate restrictions I was given. No teen gets it in the moment. But after they grow up and see what it does, how it affects kids and preys on vulnerable teens\u2026we become thankful that we were protected if we were at all. \n\nAs your daughter ages more she can have more freedom in different ways. It\u2019s going to be frustrating but this is the best thing for her. You will feel guilt but as a 13 year old mom, you\u2019re going to have a lot of that guilt coming your way for putting your foot down. It\u2019s going to suck for you, but as long as you make sure she\u2019s got age appropriate restrictions and you\u2019re giving fair punishments/rewards then you\u2019re doing a good job as a parent. In fact the guilt means you\u2019re more likely doing the right thing than not. As long as you don\u2019t give into the guilt and let her get away with things.", "Just parent her for fucks sake and take it away before she goes to bed, she\u2019s 13 \nM stop letting her walk all over you. YTA for raising such a brat.", "NTA coming from someone who flunked out of school in year 9 (Australian curriculum) and had to go back to finish I'd highly recommend setting screen time hours and implementing a WiFi only phone.  I'd also recommend speaking to her friends parents, maybe just a light casual conversation about why their kids may be staying up so late as well. Good luck", "NTA - This is gonna make me sound old.. but by 13-15 my bedtime was 8:30-9pm unless it was a special occasion or holidays and I had a phone from a couple of months before turning 14.", "NTA. 11pm is also too late for a 13year old.

I'd agree with others put a time limit application on the phone as if you're doing this on the router/AP she could just use cell data afterwards and rack up a huge bill.", "Same as our 13 yo. We just take the phone out of her room now around 10pm and charge it in ours. They have no self control at that age (heck, neither do I with the doom scrolling!) and of course you need to intervene if it\u2019s affecting school, etc. There were massive tantrums and threats of running away but she\u2019s used to it now.", "NTA. I have an app on my kids' phones that locks them at 9:00 pm, and one of them is 13 as well. Sleep is important.", "I mean i understand where you are coming from . But tbh teenagers have plenty of ways to sneak out . I know because I was one too . I m 19 rn . When I was 13 I used to stay awake till 11-12 even till 1 am . It was exciting, I liked talking to my friends and texting my crush and we had school next day at 7 am . All teenagers go through a phase where they like their phone and friends more than their parents and family. Especially when you are in your early teens tbh I don't understand why i behaved that way . When you are 13-14 u just want to do everything on your own . My life my rules .  Teenagers are grumpy and extremely moody , they like sleeping late . The more u try to force things the less they will follow it . My mother loosened a bit when I was 15-16 as compared to when I was 13-14 . Even i stopped behaving that way when I got bored of it . Idk for some reasons i couldn't fall sleep like i used to at 10 pm before in my early teens even without my phone. I think the better option is give her some freedom and sit with her and talk about how the phone is affecting her life and u have been through teenage as well so u understand her .", "You are not wrong.

If she desperately needs music to fall asleep (and I bet she doesn't) you probably have an old iPod laying around or can get one cheap on eBay.  She probably doesn't know how to use a radio...but there are those clock radios with the alarm and the little white plastic things that flip over for the time.  \n\nAm I old?  I think I may be old.

I know, we\u2019re the ones that gave them this stuff and we could take it away, but honestly that\u2019s a hill I don\u2019t care to die on.  \n As for the phone with your daughter and the data being burned up. We have a phone plan that only lets you use the data for the month, then shuts off unless you add more data (that requires a password to the account). They can still have use of their phones for talk and text, just no data until the next billing cycle. Do you have anything like that (we\u2019re in Canada)?

For a 13-year-old, an 11PM curfew is more than reasonable and at some point you have to put your foot down. If you don't want to deal with removing the data plan, just go in at 11PM and take the actual phone and give it back the next day, you can still set it to play music on the Bluetooth speaker if she really needs that to sleep.
