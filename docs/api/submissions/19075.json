{"id": 19075, "submission_id": "141th9i", "title": "AITA for refusing to talk after he answered the phone while I was talking?", "selftext": "For the past several weeks, every single time (it seems) that I attempt to talk about anything serious to my husband, his brother or dad calls when I'm in the middle of talking and he takes the call. He then sits on the phone for over a half hour every single time and when he gets off the phone, the conversation is ultimately forgotten about. \n\nA week ago I finally snapped about it and said I'm tired of ever trying to talk to him about anything because he always takes phone calls whenever I'm speaking. He said he didn't realize it bothered me and that he would make effort to stop doing this. But then today I was in the middle of talking to him about an upcoming camping trip we are trying to plan and his dad calls. He immediately takes the call and walks outside to his truck because the kids were being loud and he couldn't hear him. So I basically tossed all the plans on the counter (flyers mostly) and they landed basically everywhere. I then went and took a LONG hot shower. At some point he must have come back in and saw the flyers strewn about and came in to the bathroom and said \"Sorry, dad's having a rough day.\" (He says this every single time) So I said \"Cool\" and left it at that. He then starts talking about camping again and I'm like \"I'm quite literally all set. That conversation chance has come and gone. Get out.\" He walks out and shuts the door.\n\nI come out and start making dinner and I have my headphones in at this point. He taps me on the shoulder and asks if I'm ready to talk now and I said \"Like I said, I'm all set. If it was even remotely important to you, you wouldn't have cut me off once again to talk on your fucking phone. I will plan everything myself, per usual. I'm done speaking to you about anything of importance.\" He immediately got defensive, with the \"I can't just ignore my dad\" talk, so I said \"Yeah but you can ignore me. Awesome.\" He's currently sitting in the garage and has texted a few more times to 'apologize' for his repetitive behavior but I refuse to respond. My friend is saying I'm an AH because her dad's dead, basically, so she is on my husband's side due to the fact that she wants to speak to her dad and can't. AITA?\n\nETA: I stated in my original post that I talked to him about this a week ago so please save the \"you need to communicate\" talk. I did communicate and I was ignored. I should NOT be expected to repeat myself over and over again for him to understand. His dad calls several times a day to complain about his girlfriend not making enough money, despite him not working. That is the butt of all their conversations. No, he's not sick. He just wants to shit on his girlfriend for not having a better job despite her supporting them both. His brother calls to ask for money and that's it. The camping trip IS in fact important because it's for our sons graduation camping trip with all our family and all our kids friends. My husband insists on picking the location, yet everytime I bring it up he answers the phone instead of talking to me about a plan that needs to be set in stone by June 13th.", "created_utc": 1686002525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141th9i/aita_for_refusing_to_talk_after_he_answered_the/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
