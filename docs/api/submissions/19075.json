{"id": 19075, "submission_id": "141th9i", "title": "AITA for refusing to talk after he answered the phone while I was talking?", "selftext": "For the past several weeks, every single time (it seems) that I attempt to talk about anything serious to my husband, his brother or dad calls when I'm in the middle of talking and he takes the call. He then sits on the phone for over a half hour every single time and when he gets off the phone, the conversation is ultimately forgotten about. \n\nA week ago I finally snapped about it and said I'm tired of ever trying to talk to him about anything because he always takes phone calls whenever I'm speaking. He said he didn't realize it bothered me and that he would make effort to stop doing this. But then today I was in the middle of talking to him about an upcoming camping trip we are trying to plan and his dad calls. He immediately takes the call and walks outside to his truck because the kids were being loud and he couldn't hear him. So I basically tossed all the plans on the counter (flyers mostly) and they landed basically everywhere. I then went and took a LONG hot shower. At some point he must have come back in and saw the flyers strewn about and came in to the bathroom and said \"Sorry, dad's having a rough day.\" (He says this every single time) So I said \"Cool\" and left it at that. He then starts talking about camping again and I'm like \"I'm quite literally all set. That conversation chance has come and gone. Get out.\" He walks out and shuts the door.\n\nI come out and start making dinner and I have my headphones in at this point. He taps me on the shoulder and asks if I'm ready to talk now and I said \"Like I said, I'm all set. If it was even remotely important to you, you wouldn't have cut me off once again to talk on your fucking phone. I will plan everything myself, per usual. I'm done speaking to you about anything of importance.\" He immediately got defensive, with the \"I can't just ignore my dad\" talk, so I said \"Yeah but you can ignore me. Awesome.\" He's currently sitting in the garage and has texted a few more times to 'apologize' for his repetitive behavior but I refuse to respond. My friend is saying I'm an AH because her dad's dead, basically, so she is on my husband's side due to the fact that she wants to speak to her dad and can't. AITA?\n\nETA: I stated in my original post that I talked to him about this a week ago so please save the \"you need to communicate\" talk. I did communicate and I was ignored. I should NOT be expected to repeat myself over and over again for him to understand. His dad calls several times a day to complain about his girlfriend not making enough money, despite him not working. That is the butt of all their conversations. No, he's not sick. He just wants to shit on his girlfriend for not having a better job despite her supporting them both. His brother calls to ask for money and that's it. The camping trip IS in fact important because it's for our sons graduation camping trip with all our family and all our kids friends. My husband insists on picking the location, yet everytime I bring it up he answers the phone instead of talking to me about a plan that needs to be set in stone by June 13th.", "created_utc": 1686002525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141th9i/aita_for_refusing_to_talk_after_he_answered_the/", "score": 3600, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly though it is easy to fall back to old habits, so while I think your anger is justified I don't think that a \"I'm never talking anything serious with you ever again\" standpoint is either good or healthy. Instead it would be better to tell him you'll forgive him if and when you see an improvement in listening to you and not taking calls in the middle of a conversation with you. He can very well call back after you two are done speaking.

I wouldn\u2019t even accept his input on the trip at this point.", "This is a really common issue honestly, and in my house it comes down to upbringing.  Hubby's family was happy to let a ringing phone go to the answering machine and get back to it later.  In my house, when the phone rang, everything stopped, and if you didn't answer the phone by the third ring it was considered rude.   Now, I no longer believe that, but it took a LONG time for me to be able to ignore a ringing phone, and if I'm being honest, I still feel an anxiety spike when the phone rings that gets progressively worse if I don't answer it.   Without fail, if it's a family member I get a guilt trip later about how they weren't important enough for me to answer.  Not healthy, I know, but families are messy and mine is probably messier than average.    \n\n\nWhat I now do is glance at caller ID.  If it's someone I know (rather than a doctor's office or something), I will apologize to my husband, answer the phone and say 'Hey, person I love.  I'm in the middle of something.  Just wanted to make sure it wasn't an emergency, and if it's not I'll call you back in an hour.'   I then keep the call under a minute, hang up, and apologize to my husband again.   We've had the discussion many times, so he knows that I've got a Pavlovian anxiety response to that ringing phone and he knows the guilt trips that will happen if I ignore the call, so he gives me grace while I try really hard to make sure he understands that it isn't that he isn't important, but rather that my anxiety and I need to make sure the call isn't to tell me someone is on their way to the hospital.  We also have three kiddos with high needs and rarely have the luxury of an uninterrupted conversation, so we both try to make sure the other person knows we're interested in the discussion, but sometimes we have to put out a fire (or make there's not, in fact, a fire) before we can continue the conversation.    \n\n\nYou're definitely NTA, and frankly I probably would have been a lot more, umm, dramatic than you were in the exact same situation.   But I do encourage you to come to your husband with suggestions on how he can handle those phone calls (my parents don't text, so the 'text them that you'll get back to them later' doesn't work, as an example, so you'll need something that fits your particular situation).   You might also consider setting aside X amount of time a day where there are no interruptions, and then you can let your family know that, say, from 6-7 pm every night, your ringer is off and you will get back to them after that if they leave a message.  In any case, my guess is that he simply doesn't know HOW to ignore that 'DAD YELLED FOR ME AND I MUST RESPOND RIGHT NOW' response that he was taught from birth, and he's going to need some support to set those boundaries.   That doesn't mean he shouldn't set the boundaries, just that you might have to do more work than is fair to help him get there.     \n\n\nAlso, try not to take it personally.  I know it's hard.  I can't tell you how many times hubby and I have had some version of this fight (though for us, it's usually one of his community service projects that takes priority over our conversation and makes me feel unimportant).   He knows it upsets you, but that doesn't mean he has the skills he needs to set the boundary.  Good luck!!!", "NTA! Dad can......

He immediately takes the call and walks outside to his truck because the kids were being loud and he couldn't hear him.\n\nSo you told him it bothers you for him to immediately drop you if his dad or brother calls, and he proceeds to do it again anyway.\n\n> At some point he must have come back in and saw the flyers strewn about and came in to the bathroom and said \"Sorry, dad's having a rough day.\" (He says this every single time) So I said \"Cool\" and left it at that. He then starts talking about camping again and I'm like \"I'm quite literally all set. That conversation chance has come and gone. Get out.\" He walks out and shuts the door.\n\nSo he defends himself by saying his dad was having a rough day, which apparently is always his go to statement. The proper response would've been to not answer his dad. He should've apologized immediately for breaking his promise.\n\n> I come out and start making dinner and I have my headphones in at this point.

If it was even remotely important to you, you wouldn't have cut me off once again to talk on your fucking phone. I will plan everything myself, per usual. I'm done speaking to you about anything of importance.\" He immediately got defensive, with the \"I can't just ignore my dad\" talk, so I said \"Yeah but you can ignore me. Awesome.\"\n\nExactly the right response. He can't just ignore his dad, but he can ignore you? Sorry, but when you get married, your priorities change to your spouse and children, not your parents/siblings.\n\n> He's currently sitting in the garage and has texted a few more times to 'apologize' for his repetitive behavior but I refuse to respond.\n\nHe's sorry now that you won't speak to him, but he wasn't sorry enough the first time you told him to stop doing what he was doing.\n\n> My friend is saying I'm an AH because her dad's dead, basically, so she is on my husband's side due to the fact that she wants to speak to her dad and can't.\n\nYour friend is pushing her desires for a relationship with a father no longer among the living into your life.\n\n> His dad calls several times a day to complain about his girlfriend not making enough money, despite him not working. That is the butt of all their conversations. No, he's not sick. He just wants to shit on his girlfriend for not having a better job despite her supporting them both. His brother calls to ask for money and that's it.\n\nSo what they keep calling over isn't even important. His father just wants someone to vent to, amd his brother just wants money.

You do not need to answer the phone instantly every time like you're Pavlov's dog. Honestly, I'd ask him to take one day where he does not answer a single phone call, and instead calls everyone back after five minutes, just to train himself out of that automatic reaction. Frequently I'll be in the middle of something and just let it ring out and say, I'll call back in half an hour and if it's more important they'll call again in five.

But I\u2019ve expressed repeatedly to both of them how frustrating it is to feel like I\u2019m always being interrupted in a conversation. It\u2019s not a one and done thing. These are lifelong habits people have developed, and they can be more of a compulsion than a habit. It takes patience and perseverance. \n\nThey both catch themselves quite often now, and apologize. Other times when they don\u2019t catch themselves and it\u2019s the fifth time I\u2019ve tried to get a sentence out, I just let them finish and sit there staring at them.

I *know* this isn\u2019t true with my boyfriend and mom - they love and respect me, and do genuinely care what I have to say. They just have these compulsions that developed over a lifetime, and they aren\u2019t going to change over night. It takes repeated reinforcement on my part, and repeated effort on their part. But they *do* show an effort, which is ultimately what\u2019s important.\n\nOP is NTA for being upset, and I think she handled it well, however expecting an instant change unfortunately isn\u2019t realistic.

Like maybe go into the next room or ask the kids to quiet down a little, but immediately going outside seems very secretive. It also explains his need to pick up every time.

If he is really apologizing, and it sounds like he is and you still want a relationship with him I would say ask him to make a commitment to improve. With real actions planned by both of you, he will need help.\n\nI would suggest therapy, and if you can afford it I think it would be very useful, but even if you can't do therapy there are other ways to go around this.\n\nSit with him and say \"you say you can't ignore your father, so is it OK to ignore me? Yes or no?\". He will of course say no. Then outline examples of how what his father calls him for is not so important and it basically sabotages his relationship with his family. Get him to agree. He needs to first intellectually agree with you. It doesn't mean he will be able to act upon it, but it is the first step. He may not want to agree because it is really hard for people to realize their family are abusive towards them. For me, the way you describe his father, sounds abusive, they basically use him to get money or to dump all their problem with complete disregard of his needs.\n\nNext ask him, how can you stop this from happening. For example phones are off while you are talking important things. Still it is not the best solution, but it would be a first step. I would say you can come up with a code word, so it will help him to remember the conversation. And when he takes the call you say the word and he should hung up.\n\nI understand your frustration, I have been in relationships like this. We all have traumas from our childhood. Sometimes you can tell they really want to do better, sometimes you can tell they truly don't give a damn. I think your husband wants to do better. I think the fact that he sits in the garage sending you texts to apologize means he is really sorry. Usually with people that don't think you are right will blame you non stop. He is not acting that way. \n\nI know this is little consolation, and to be honest it is up to you if you want to put yourself through it. But just talking is not enough, if you want something but don't have a plan, it is just a wish. Right now you have brought this up and he wishes he does better. Of course that won't work. He is used to give in to his family all the time. That is not something he can get over all of the sudden. It is not healthy for him either. But he needs to acknowledge that it is not normal for his family to be calling him many times a day and for him dropping off everything he is doing for them. He is being the emotional support for them and neglecting the family he created with you. His family problems are not problems that warrant him to drop stuff all of the sudden every time.\n\nAlso once a situation has pissed you so much like you are right now something has to change or everything is going to go downhill and your family life will become increasingly toxic. So he needs to step up if he really loves his family and wants to stay with you and his children. It is that simple.\n\nNTA.", "> you should suggest he turn off his phone completely for the duration of the conversation.\n\nHell, he don't even have to turn phone off.  How about turning volume all the way off when he and OP are having important conversations."]}
