Dogs used to be vital to Islamic countries for essentially being the first public sanitation crew.\n\nOf course, once society developed a real answer for cleaning up garbage, hungry dogs and sick dogs became a health crisis. It's conjecture to say that that's why dogs are \"poisonous\" but it's not a stretch.", "What I find most interesting is that cats are totally fine in Islam and people fuss over cats in much the same way non Muslims fuss over dogs. As a cat person in a country where people can be very nasty to cats on reflex, I appreciate knowing that they have a cherished place in some cultures!", "Islam is really big on both spiritual and physical cleanliness. I did a deep dive into research a while back and they have all sorts of rules about it. It's a difference of opinion whether dogs are allowed in the home or not. Kinda interesting, and very confusing.", "This afaik is why Saluki dogs are popular & beloved in the Middle East/North Africa.  They don\u2019t drool, smell, or shed like a lot of dogs.  Even very conservative Muslim Bedouins will let their salukis into their tents.  But I agree with the other poster - overall, cats are much more beloved in the ME.", "I'm allergic to dog drool. I just got a breed that wasn't drooly lol", "Just sounded like a weird new age belief to me, like something someone would make up to increase isolation", "Don't ask questions you don't want to hear the answer to. After the first insane request to re-home the dog my response would have been considerably less nice.", "You\u2019re not wrong, but I would have done the same thing OP did. No, actually I would have laughed in brothers face, then answered.\n\nBut, yes, it certainly did not de-escalate the situation.", "I have three beagles their majestic", "They just get cats instead. It isn't that deep. \n\nHell, I'm from Ireland, and when I moved to Britain a decade ago I was incredibly weirded out to see dogs friendly bars and restaurants; it just felt really odd to have animals in such close proximity to where food and drink was prepared. Even between two islands with intertwined and similar cultures, it was enough of a difference for me to pick up on."]}
