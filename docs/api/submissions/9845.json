Around 7-8 months ago he decided to change his lifestyle and be healthier. He was overweight but already lost a lot of weight and fitter. I was his workout/motivation buddy throughout these months but lately he\u2019s been confident enough to do his own thing. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we went to a friends party (it wasn\u2019t really a party, more of a low key get together). James is shy/awkward and tends to stick with me whenever we go to social environments with lots of people. But at some point this (tipsy) girl came up to him and seemed clearly interested. She was ignoring me *entirely*. I was about to walk off when she asked me -in front of several others - if James and I are a together.\n\nI laughed and joked that she wouldn\u2019t have asked me this if she had seen him last year. I was immediately told by some friends that it was a mean thing to say, and in hindsight James seemed a little speechless. The girl asked me what I meant and I explained that he used to be way chubbier. Then she shrugged and said he\u2019s \u201chot\u201d and would take him off me if I didn\u2019t mind. I thought this was trashy and just left. \n\nAfterwards I spoke to James in private and he seemed to have gotten his feelings hurt. I explained it was just a joke cos last year NOBODY would\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re together. I mean the whole point of the joke was that he\u2019s considered more attractive *now* but I know his true awkward self and past. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1676294094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1117ymt/aita_for_making_a_harmless_joke_about_my_formerly/", "score": 14796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You exploited his soft spot. And you aren't his \"friend\".\n\nThe girl who hit on James wasn't trashy, you were. And I would completely understand if he never wanted to speak to you again. You mentioned he recently started getting more confident and you went ahead and kicked him down the first chance you got. James is shy/awkward so sticks with you in social gatherings because he finds it safe and comfortable and you took that away from him as well.\n\nAND, just because he was a little overweight earlier, doesn't mean you were automatically too good for him back then that nobody would assume that you two could be together. You do realize that overweight people are capable of being in relationships with people who are not of the same size, right?\n\n Get off of that high horse, you are not better than him.", "YTA, embarrassingly so. One for implying he was completely undesirable when he weighed more, two for making it clear you thought you were better than him at the time. These are the actions of a bad friend and a shallow child.", "Yes, YTA. Huge AH. You basically just told James that he is only worthy of love and affection when he is fit and attractive.", "YTA. Pro tip: When you start off a sentence saying \"AITA for making a harmless joke...\", your joke wasn't a joke, it wasn't harmless, and you're the asshole.", "YTA \n\nThis entire post screams of \"I'm hotter than James!!\" You seem like you kept him around to be the \"fat friend,\" and now that he's getting attention, you're jealous. You think you're hot shit and because you're a girl giving James attention, like he's a charity case, he should be obsessed with only you.", "\"I laughed and joked that she wouldn\u2019t have asked me this if she had seen him last year.\"\n\nAren't you full of yourself?

YTA.", "YTA. \n\nHoly Jesus, you have to know this isn't a harmless joke. It was tasteless, crass and RUDE. Not to mention, pointless. \n\nYou made a dig at his former weight which wasn't cool. Lots of people who grow up chubby or overweight have lots of mental hang ups about that time and you just decided to stick a knife in a twist. \n\nJames was probably stunned that his \"friend\" turned out to be an absolute jerk.", "I actually think the response was really classy. It allowed her to defend the guy who was being attacked for no reason, highlighted that you were being an ass, and also allowed her to continue flirting with him. It was pretty masterful.\n\n\nYTA you sound very insecure.", "Well it clearly WASN\u2019T just a harmless joke considering the outcome, now is it?\n\nYTA big time. You basically verified all of your friend\u2019s insecurities and made it sound like people would only be interested in people for their looks, which must been awful for your friend to hear come out of YOUR mouth after all of your support prior. Be a better friend.", "YTA, you tried to cock block him and you insulted him\n\nAre you jealous that he gets attention? Do you fancy him and you're just lying to us and yourself?\n\nYou either make a move on him on let him be, girl.", "YTA for making a hurtful comment.\n\nAnd TICKETS MUCH?\n\nCan you please explain the joke to me, I don't quite understand it.\n\nWhy would nobody have thought you were together last year?\n\nEDIT - changed the word joke to comment 2 minutes after writing.", "Obviously YTA. Why is it automatically true that a fat guy couldn\u2019t be your partner? And what does this random girl care what he used to look like? It honestly sounds you\u2019re jealous that someone thought James was cute and you wanted to make sure he didn\u2019t feel too good about himself.", "YTA. Do you often put others down to feel better about yourself?", "YTA, sometimes just a 'no' is OK...\n\nWere you trying to put her off your friend? And if so, why?", "YTA \n\nSo you\u2019re just publicly making the statement that overweight folks are undateable, and you don\u2019t see how that\u2019s gross? You\u2019ve never seen a couple who didn\u2019t share a body type? \n\nWe get it, you think you\u2019re too hot to be associate with \u201cthose\u201d kinds of bodies. Do yourself a favor and keep that unsavory mindset to yourself.", "YTA and a big one. You essentially just verified all the insecurities James had when he was overweight. Youre also saying that looks are everything. But let me tell you, no matter how good you look OP, youll always be unattractive with that personality.", "Ever heard of the concept wingman? You are literally 180 degrees the opposite of this.\n\nOff course YTA, keep your body shaming dumb comments to yourself.", "\"I know his true awkward self and past\". In other words, he'll always be a fat loser to you. It sounds like he's out of your league though. Maybe if you work on your personality..", "YTA.

Make a full apology and don\u2019t take someone assuming you might be together as such an insult.", "YTA, OP. \n1. This entire post reeks of jealousy and if you're jealous at the fact that someone is flirting with your friend and taking it out at his expense then you need to sort out your feelings and go to therapy..\n2. If you're uncomfortable with people thinking that you're \"together / in a relationship\" you could have just said \"no, we're just friends\" simple as that. \n3. Is it still a joke, if the person who you made \"a joke\" about, explicitly told you that they have been hurt by it? No, it's not a joke.

I think you have an issue with your friend now being perceived as \"hot\" and are getting jealous of the attention he's getting.", "YTA. And when you make a joke like that, just know that it wasn't \"harmless\" at all. You're not the one to judge if your friend was harmed or not.", "With friends like you who needs enemies?\n\nSeriously, that was cruel as fuck \n\nYTA", "YTA. You were jealous that a girl showed you no attention and called your friend hot. So you decided to tell a \u2018joke\u2019 to tear him down a peg. Are you subconsciously upset that he is getting attention now, or you are just that much of an AH to your friends? \n\nIf you tell a joke and you\u2019re the only one that thinks it\u2019s funny at all, then you aren\u2019t actually telling a joke. You upset your friend because you basically told the girl that he isn\u2019t worth her time because he *used* to be chubbier, despite the fact that he has actually put in the work to change himself and is getting results.", "YTA\n\nAnd you need to look up the word \"harmless\" because it means \"not causing harm,\" which does not apply here.", "YTA a hundred times over and James really needs to find a new friend, a real friend, not you. You made the joke specifically to make your friend look bad out of petty jealousy because she was interested in him now you. Also I had an inkling just from the title that your overall an ass. If a joke hurt someone it obviously wasnt harmless was it? I mean hurting someone is harm by definition is it not? You call it harmless to downplay how you were a dick, not because it actually was harmless.\n\nA piece of advice, just because someone says somethings a joke doesn't mean it is one. You cant just use humor to disguise making rude comments to and about people. \n\nYour inconsiderate and emphathetic treatment of your friend disgusts me. Thats not how you treat a friend.", "\u201cShe was ignoring me entirely\u201d\n\nSounds like someone\u2019s a little jealous and insecure. Yeah, YTA.", "If you can't see why YTA I don't even think I can explain it to you. Yikes.", "YTA it\u2019s mean to James and you come across as very full of yourself.

You are dense. Your friend deserves a huge apology from you.", "YTA first for insulting your friend. What were you jealous another person was into him? Second for thinking a girl was trashy for being into him. You need to apologize.", "Anytime I see someone on here describe something as a harmless joke, I know it's a cop out. It harmed him. Therefore if wasn't harmless was it? It was mean and shallow. You seem to lack empathy. YTA.", "You couldn't just say no we're good friends. Definitely TAH", "YTA and superficial.", "YTA\n\nThat was a really mean and snide thing to say.  \n\nYou knew this is something he feels insecure about.  You knew she would ask what you meant.  You were trying to sabotage the situation rather than be happy for him.\n\nThen to brush it off as a joke.  Funny thing is no one else seems to be laughing. \n\nPretty shitty friend you are OP.  Time to have a long hard look at yourself and why you decided to behave like that.", "YTA\u2026and you have the stones to call the other girls behavior \u2019trashy\u2019?", "What a shitty thing to say.

You're a massive AH.", "YTA. It was not a harmless joke. You said that when he was fat he was undesirable and that you considered him to be so.", "YTA because you made it seem as if James wasn't worthy of having a companion because of his weight.

I'm a little bigger myself and I'd be absolutely mortified if my friends said that now that I've started losing weight.\n\nThat's going to cut deeply for him and even if you apologise, which I sincerely hope you have, it's going to haunt him for a while.\n\nYou're the absolute asshole, op", "YTA. I am absolutely gooped and gagged. How is bringing up something that you KNOW your friend is uncomfortable about and try to pass it off as a joke? It sounds like you don't like him getting positive attention.", "YTA - Hey! Remember that really embarrassing thing from your past that you worked hard to change? I'm gonna bring that up anytime someone threatens to boost your confidence so you never get over it. - That's what you did.", "YTA\n\nThat's a pretty insulting thing to say to and in front of a stranger who was interested in him.

Inside out ugly is the worst ugly there is.", "YTA, the comment was unnecessary.\n\nI'm hoping James doesn't have some secret feelings for you, because if he does they're certainly gone now after that shallow comment :/\n\nSounds like your little green monster showed up because another girl gave him attention.", "YTA. \n\nThat \u00ab\u00a0joke\u00a0\u00bb was not warranted at all and I\u2019m amazed at the mental gymnastics you had to do to bring his weight into the conversation. \n\nPlease get over your ridiculous self.", "Holy shit you are such an asshole oh my god. You literally said - in different words - my friend was worthless when he was fat, so of course he wouldn\u2019t be worth dating, but now he\u2019s worth dating because he\u2019s lost weight.\n\nYou didn\u2019t make a joke.

Did you even apologize?", "YTA while your friend can change his lifestyle and body it'll be much harder for you to grow a brain.

If it was a joke, what was funny?", "YTA all round but this line stuck out to me: \n\n \"he seemed to have gotten his feelings hurt\"\n\nNo, OP. Try \"I said something hurtful\".", "YTA.

On what planet does that count as a \"harmless\" joke??", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t a harmless joke, it was a cruel one that you directed at your \u201cfriend\u201d. And the reason?  You were pissy a girl showed interest in your friend and not you. I can tell because you made sure to emphasise the entirely. Funny that you\u2019re apparently so insecure you have to take digs at your pals\u2026 How have *you* grown in the last year, huh?\n\nEdit: oh I fully missed the part where you were helping him until he got confident enough to work out alone.

Trust me honey, after that comment, everyone knows who the \u2018ugly\u2019 person is.", "YTA. Mostly for the joke, but also for clearly thinking that it's impossible to be both overweight and hot. Which, as someone who is very overweight, is something we struggle with all. the. time, and that makes us suffer horribly. People can be overweight and still be a 10/10.\n\nBut maybe people would never have assumed you were a couple before because they know how shallow you are?", "YTA and you sound jealous", "So you made a joke at the expense of a friend.\n\nYou essentially fatshamed someone for no reason.\n\nYou can't tell if this friend is actually upset because you say he > seemed to have gotten his feelings hurt\n\n\nGosh this a difficult one.

I hope he takes this as the warning it is and gets the hell away from you.

Around 7-8 months ago he decided to change his lifestyle and be healthier. He was overweight but already lost a lot of weight and fitter. I was his workout/motivation buddy throughout these months but lately he\u2019s been confident enough to do his own thing. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we went to a friends party (it wasn\u2019t really a party, more of a low key get together). James is shy/awkward and tends to stick with me whenever we go to social environments with lots of people. But at some point this (tipsy) girl came up to him and seemed clearly interested. She was ignoring me *entirely*. I was about to walk off when she asked me -in front of several others - if James and I are a together.\n\nI laughed and joked that she wouldn\u2019t have asked me this if she had seen him last year. I was immediately told by some friends that it was a mean thing to say, and in hindsight James seemed a little speechless. The girl asked me what I meant and I explained that he used to be way chubbier. Then she shrugged and said he\u2019s \u201chot\u201d and would take him off me if I didn\u2019t mind. I thought this was trashy and just left. \n\nAfterwards I spoke to James in private and he seemed to have gotten his feelings hurt. I explained it was just a joke cos last year NOBODY would\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re together. I mean the whole point of the joke was that he\u2019s considered more attractive *now* but I know his true awkward self and past. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "It sounds like your comments at the party may have come across as insensitive to James. While your intention may have been to joke and acknowledge his weight loss journey, it's possible that your words came across as mean or hurtful.  \nIt's important to remember that people's self-esteem and confidence can be deeply tied to their appearance and weight, so making comments about someone's past physical appearance, even if meant in jest, can be damaging.  \nIt's great that you had a private conversation with James to try to clear things up, but it's important to consider how your words and actions may impact those around you, especially those who are close to you. If you're not sure whether your words or actions may be hurtful, it's always a good idea to err on the side of caution and speak kindly.", "YTA!!!!", "It was backhanded, but i dont believe you quite understand why it is backhanded and that you actually tried to \u00abcompliment\u00bb his recent changes.

I was lucky as that's not a common thing most like your friend wouldn't have felt they were good enough.\n\nTalk to him again and say that it wasn't an attack on him or his personality, reassure him that he is unbelievably amazing as a person. \n\n\nCould your friend have feelings for You also?

Basically a stone cold rejection lmao\n\n\n>Took the L that night and it did shake me a bit at the time", "Please don\u2019t make a move on her. He deserves much better.", "Because she\u2019s a huge asshole and he is not. So obviously he would never want to be with her.", "The title alone oozes asshole vibes", "Yes! The wording in the title is a red flag.\n\nAlso this:\n\n>I spoke to James in private and he seemed to have gotten his feelings hurt.\n\nAnd this:\n\n>but I know his true awkward self and past.", "Don\u2019t forget she decided to make sure he was single before she acted on her desire. Makes her super classy.", "Unfortunately for OP, it's a lot easier to lose weight than to lose a nasty personality.", "It's my hope that James will take care of that himself.", "OP: \"AITA for telling a harmless joke that clearly caused harm?\"", "OP is a woman", "We use it in Australia too.  Could be UK based.  Tickets on oneself means \"thinks your sh1t doesn't stink\"", "I sure af do. I think big, burly, gentle men are crazy attractive. My latest celebrity crush is Cameron Britton.", "I know seriously, I wish James could read these comments to make sure he ditches this \"friend\" and moves on to a great life.", "I was in a similar situation a long time ago and one day like a few months after I started dating a girl she called me all upset and said I pretty much had to pick her or my girlfriend (keep in mind she was married and was never interested in being in a relationship with me). I picked my girlfriend and we've been married for 7 years.", "The snuggle comfort level is unparalleled.", "My favorite is \u201c last year NOBODY would have assumed were together\u201d. Thats next level arrogance, ego and feeling of superiority. \nYikes.", "> I explained it was just a joke cos last year NOBODY would\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re together.\n\nThis is my fave. Like she's soooo fantastically hot that nobody would have deemed him worthy of her last year.  Jesus, OP, get over yourself.  HUGE YTA.", "And I'll bet your life smells much better now!\ud83d\ude01", "That is what I thought, too.  The drunk girl had more class and better manners.", "Other person is a seemingly good person making sure she's not interjecting herself and breaking up a couple or causing a fight if he returns her attention.\n\nOPs friend: take the new girl and run!", "That part is what sent me. SHE\u2019S trashy for complimenting him, but nothing trashy at all about OP saying she thinks she\u2019s too good for him? And that she thought he was so ugly when he was heavier that no one could have possibly assumed they were together. What a public and mean way  to tell your friend you only value him when he\u2019s skinny.", "Hahaha right!?! OP should take a lesson from that girl\u2019s elite-level recovery of the situation, in which she was able to diffuse the awkward aftermath of bitchiness with a counter compliment. \n\nNot trashy at all. That was gold.", "Nah even worse is \"I know his true awkward self and past.\"", "Yes. Nothing like getting rid of the stench of emotional vampires.", "DING DING DING DING DING DING DING!\ud83d\udece\ufe0f", "Yeah, she sounds cool. I hope this guy trades up.", "Exactly. OP's angle from the start is manipulation and self-aggrandization.  You know who does that as naturally as breathing?  AHs.", "Exactly! \"Please explain how that is funny. I don't get it.\" Then watch them try to take it back.", "Yikes\u2026.You actually posted this and thought to yourself how am I the asshole? Do some inner digging and stay off the Tik toks.", "I think I knew this exact girl lol. I was friends with this girl in schools ex and she called me fat cos she got jealous that he could possibly have his own friends. I looked down at my belly and acted like I'd never noticed before (small scream/yelp and fake crying). I think it confused her more than anything but she got embarrassed and I never heard from her again. I call it a mission success\ud83d\ude02", "Nah; she placed him in the \"unattractive friend\" box and hasn't moved him from it since, regardless of his fitness level. It is why she has no problem being casually cruel to him in front of others, laughed at the very idea that they could be together, and (likely) doesn't see why other women would find him attractive which is also why she chose to qualify her description of this other girl calling her tipsy and trashy...because only someone who was drunk and trashy would think that she would be with him or consider him remotely attractive. As far as she's concerned he's *her* charity case and she keeps him around because she enjoys (or enjoyed) his ego-boosting attention.", "I had to scroll back up because I didn't get beyond the first few sentences before coming to the conclusion that, yes OP is the AH, but missed \"I know his true awkward self\" at the end til you quoted it here.\n\n\nOP, if you have never felt awkward in your life before, let me explain, that shite never goes away. If you know he felt awkward in the past about his body and dating or social interaction, or whatever else you're labeling as \"awkward,\" it is so tremendously difficult to hide that feeling and completely escape it in a situation like the one where the gentleman found himself in, with the interested gal you, OP referred to as \"trashy.\" Well I for one hope the gal scooped him up and showed him the  \"trashiest\" good goddamned night of his life now that he's worked hard enough to feel attractive for a change in his life. He certainly deserves it. I'm glad you left the scene so he could hopefully recover and have a nice time with some good company.", "I know, right? For her next trick OP will drop a chandelier in the opera house.", "I honestly hope your friend starts dating the \"trashy\" girl lmao", "Not sure if I am allowed to say this here but OP you really fucking suck dude. And just a little info, I am the kind of guy to go well out of my way to be nice and kind to someone so I don't tell people they suck a lot. But you, you are the type of person I built half of my character fighting against. People like you are so self-absorbed and I dare say narcissistic, that you actually see other people as some sort of accessory to you. Like a coat or a screwdriver. Just something to help you do the thing you were wanting to do. \n\nYou try to tell us that he is your friend and you consistently body shame him? After he worked so hard and you were the one to first hand watch him put in the work to better himself? You OP, are the disgusting one. I wouldn't let anyone I love or respect associate with people that just crush their friends in public like you've done. And who knows how much you don't share that you do. I can't imagine the way you think and what your inner thoughts are like. \n\nI haven't ever had weight issues or anything myself, but I know people struggle with it and it is really hard and painful for some. For you to just pick their wounds/scars with salt on your hands is just malicious and only reflects your own deeply embedded insecurities. I wish you love, kindness, and understanding bc it feels like you lack these.", "INFO: when did you realise you were in love with James?", "Absolute, massive huge AH.\n\nYou wonder why James is shy and a bit socially awkward? He's probably been copping shit his whole life.\n\nYou should be thankful to have a friend with the drive and dedication to identify within himself to make changes for his benefit in the future. Even if he didn't, and you're friends... given what is seemingly a pretty toxic mindset from OP, you're friends, have some respect for friendship at the least.\n\nGuys who have grown up overweight ( often can't choose that either, metabolism of a teenager, maybe his parents weren't concious of healthy eating, good luck losing or maintaining healthy weight at that age starting behind the 8 ball) often can't do anything about it until they're exiting, or have exited puberty entirely.\n\nGood on James, don't destroy his self esteem and determination for getting himself in good shape.", "Op is a girl not a guy", "You\u2019re asking some very valid questions here. Especially why she was upset with the person ignored her until they didn\u2019t. That seems like a weird thing to highlight and then drop.\n\nAlso I can\u2019t stand people describing a joke as \u201charmless\u201d. Every harmless joke I have heard did not need to be announced it was harmless or inoffensive. Also OP can\u2019t be the one to decide how the \u201cjoke\u201d was received, that\u2019s up to the recipient if it was harmless or not. You can\u2019t dictate someone\u2019s feelings.\n\nAlso I have quite a few guy friends since some of my hobbies are/were in male-dominant fields. OP has no idea how to be a supportive female friend of a guy or a supportive friend in general. Make sure your friends are being shown in the best light, be a good wingwoman, be inclusive but not pushy if your friend is shy. These are things that shouldn\u2019t have to be said if you value your friendship. Good actions in service of your friends should be automatic. Saying snarky comments so that some woman hitting on your friend (in a social setting where people drink and flirt and there\u2019s nothing trashy about it) hopefully loses interest is the complete opposite of supportive.", "Person: Are you and James together?  \n\nOP: Ha, no.  He used to be fat.\n\nPerson: I think he's hot.\n\nOP: Ew, you're trashy.\n\n**Unbelievable.**", "Definitely. She even straight said the girl was ignoring her entirely... Like that's usually something a girlfriend would say, no?", "\"I don't want him but nobody else can have him either\"\n\nShe's like a toddler with a toy and it's pathetic. \"I don't play with Teddy or really care about him, but if Cindy wants to play with Teddy, now I have to keep him from her!\"", "She doesn't want to date him but she really likes having somebody around that wants her all the time. Hopefully the dude wises up and just moves on", "Holy shit. Poor James\u2026 This sounds like my nightmare as someone who has lost a lot of weight.", "When I first met my boyfriend, he was carrying a lot of extra weight, and I wasn\u2019t necessarily attracted to that specific aspect of him. Even so, I immediately had a crush on him because he was clever and funny and easygoing and friendly AND _physically attractive_. Because even if fluffiness isn\u2019t really someone\u2019s jam, for many\u2014dare I say most?\u2014people, there are tons of other physical characteristics that can make someone hot or not.", "Indeed, her whole attitude of the girl wouldn't have thought they were together last year, indicates she was so \"hot\" she couldn't have possibly been with him. Nice way to talk about a friend. /s\n\nI hope James' self-esteem is so improved that he won't hang out with this cruel girl again. He needs a friend upgrade, her post made me cringe.", "YEP! If she don't want him, nobody else should too kinda vibe.", "I know, right? I love that girl.", "I'd be ignoring someone like that, too. I like the girl who told her off when she tried to say shit about him.", "Right!? \"You were uglier last year.\"  \n\n\nExplain to me how that's funny.  It's not a joke.  It's just an awkward, mean comment.", "OP doesn\u2019t see it as nasty like the rest of us do because she thinks her fatphobia is a fact, not a shitty opinion. \n\nI know Reddit hated the word fatphobia, but this is exactly what it refers to. OP dehumanized her friend for his weight and doesn\u2019t even see the problem with doing that, because deep down she thinks fat people deserve it. \n\nSpeaking as someone who went from almost 200 to 125 lbs in college, there are a lot of people like OP, and they all suck.", "Totally this.  And, OP is now at risk of losing her convenient, pseudo-boyfriend who is always there to give her attention.  Selfishness through and through.", ">last year NOBODY would\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re together. I mean the whole point of the joke was that he\u2019s considered more attractive   \n>  \n>now\n\nthis is my favourite part.  She seems to think she's so great that people would assume she wouldn't date someone overweight.  That says way more about her than it does about him.  Even if she was a 10, her piss poor attitude makes her a 5 or less."]}
