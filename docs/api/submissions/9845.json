Around 7-8 months ago he decided to change his lifestyle and be healthier. He was overweight but already lost a lot of weight and fitter. I was his workout/motivation buddy throughout these months but lately he\u2019s been confident enough to do his own thing. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we went to a friends party (it wasn\u2019t really a party, more of a low key get together). James is shy/awkward and tends to stick with me whenever we go to social environments with lots of people. But at some point this (tipsy) girl came up to him and seemed clearly interested. She was ignoring me *entirely*. I was about to walk off when she asked me -in front of several others - if James and I are a together.\n\nI laughed and joked that she wouldn\u2019t have asked me this if she had seen him last year. I was immediately told by some friends that it was a mean thing to say, and in hindsight James seemed a little speechless. The girl asked me what I meant and I explained that he used to be way chubbier. Then she shrugged and said he\u2019s \u201chot\u201d and would take him off me if I didn\u2019t mind. I thought this was trashy and just left. \n\nAfterwards I spoke to James in private and he seemed to have gotten his feelings hurt. I explained it was just a joke cos last year NOBODY would\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re together. I mean the whole point of the joke was that he\u2019s considered more attractive *now* but I know his true awkward self and past. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1676294094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1117ymt/aita_for_making_a_harmless_joke_about_my_formerly/", "score": 451, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You exploited his soft spot. And you aren't his \"friend\".\n\nThe girl who hit on James wasn't trashy, you were. And I would completely understand if he never wanted to speak to you again. You mentioned he recently started getting more confident and you went ahead and kicked him down the first chance you got. James is shy/awkward so sticks with you in social gatherings because he finds it safe and comfortable and you took that away from him as well.\n\nAND, just because he was a little overweight earlier, doesn't mean you were automatically too good for him back then that nobody would assume that you two could be together. You do realize that overweight people are capable of being in relationships with people who are not of the same size, right?\n\n Get off of that high horse, you are not better than him.", "YTA, embarrassingly so. One for implying he was completely undesirable when he weighed more, two for making it clear you thought you were better than him at the time. You are a bad friend and a shallow child.", "Yes, YTA. Huge AH. You basically just told James that he is only worthy of love and affection when he is fit and attractive.", "YTA. Pro tip: When you start off a sentence saying \"AITA for making a harmless joke...\", your joke wasn't a joke, it wasn't harmless, and you're the asshole.", "YTA \n\nThis entire post screams of \"I'm hotter than James!!\" You seem like you kept him around to be the \"fat friend,\" and now that he's getting attention, you're jealous. You think you're hot shit and because you're a girl giving James attention, like he's a charity case, he should be obsessed with only you.", "\"I laughed and joked that she wouldn\u2019t have asked me this if she had seen him last year.\"\n\nAren't you full of yourself?

YTA.", "YTA. \n\nHoly Jesus, you have to know this isn't a harmless joke. It was tasteless, crass and RUDE. Not to mention, pointless. \n\nYou made a dig at his former weight which wasn't cool. Lots of people who grow up chubby or overweight have lots of mental hang ups about that time and you just decided to stick a knife in a twist. \n\nJames was probably stunned that his \"friend\" turned out to be an absolute jerk.", "I actually think the response was really classy. It allowed her to defend the guy who was being attacked for no reason, highlighted that you were being an ass, and also allowed her to continue flirting with him. It was pretty masterful.\n\n\nYTA you sound very insecure.", "Well it clearly WASN\u2019T just a harmless joke considering the outcome, now is it?\n\nYTA big time. You basically verified all of your friend\u2019s insecurities and made it sound like people would only be interested in people for their looks, which must been awful for your friend to hear come out of YOUR mouth after all of your support prior. Be a better friend.", "YTA, you tried to cock block him and you insulted him\n\nAre you jealous that he gets attention? Do you fancy him and you're just lying to us and yourself?\n\nYou either make a move on him on let him be, girl.", "YTA for making a hurtful comment.\n\nAnd TICKETS MUCH?\n\nCan you please explain the joke to me, I don't quite understand it.\n\nWhy would nobody have thought you were together last year?\n\nEDIT - changed the word joke to comment 2 minutes after writing.", "Obviously YTA. Why is it automatically true that a fat guy couldn\u2019t be your partner? And what does this random girl care what he used to look like? It honestly sounds you\u2019re jealous that someone thought James was cute and you wanted to make sure he didn\u2019t feel too good about himself.", "YTA. Do you often put others down to feel better about yourself?", "YTA, sometimes just a 'no' is OK...\n\nWere you trying to put her off your friend? And if so, why?", "YTA \n\nSo you\u2019re just publicly making the statement that overweight folks are undateable, and you don\u2019t see how that\u2019s gross?

Do yourself a favor and keep that unsavory mindset to yourself.", "YTA and a big one. You essentially just verified all the insecurities James had when he was overweight. Youre also saying that looks are everything. But let me tell you, no matter how good you look OP, youll always be unattractive with that personality.", "Ever heard of the concept wingman? You are literally 180 degrees the opposite of this.\n\nOff course YTA, keep your body shaming dumb comments to yourself.", "\"I know his true awkward self and past\".

This entire post reeks of jealousy and if you're jealous at the fact that someone is flirting with your friend and taking it out at his expense then you need to sort out your feelings and go to therapy..\n2. If you're uncomfortable with people thinking that you're \"together / in a relationship\" you could have just said \"no, we're just friends\" simple as that. \n3.

I think you have an issue with your friend now being perceived as \"hot\" and are getting jealous of the attention he's getting.", "YTA. And when you make a joke like that, just know that it wasn't \"harmless\" at all. You're not the one to judge if your friend was harmed or not.", "With friends like you who needs enemies?\n\nSeriously, that was cruel as fuck \n\nYTA", "YTA. You were jealous that a girl showed you no attention and called your friend hot. So you decided to tell a \u2018joke\u2019 to tear him down a peg. Are you subconsciously upset that he is getting attention now, or you are just that much of an AH to your friends? \n\nIf you tell a joke and you\u2019re the only one that thinks it\u2019s funny at all, then you aren\u2019t actually telling a joke. You upset your friend because you basically told the girl that he isn\u2019t worth her time because he *used* to be chubbier, despite the fact that he has actually put in the work to change himself and is getting results.", "YTA\n\nAnd you need to look up the word \"harmless\" because it means \"not causing harm,\" which does not apply here.", "YTA a hundred times over and James really needs to find a new friend, a real friend, not you. You made the joke specifically to make your friend look bad out of petty jealousy because she was interested in him now you. Also I had an inkling just from the title that your overall an ass. If a joke hurt someone it obviously wasnt harmless was it? I mean hurting someone is harm by definition is it not? You call it harmless to downplay how you were a dick, not because it actually was harmless.\n\nA piece of advice, just because someone says somethings a joke doesn't mean it is one. You cant just use humor to disguise making rude comments to and about people. \n\nYour inconsiderate and emphathetic treatment of your friend disgusts me. Thats not how you treat a friend.", "\u201cShe was ignoring me entirely\u201d\n\nSounds like someone\u2019s a little jealous and insecure. Yeah, YTA.", "If you can't see why YTA I don't even think I can explain it to you. Yikes.", "YTA it\u2019s mean to James and you come across as very full of yourself.

You are dense. Your friend deserves a huge apology from you.", "YTA first for insulting your friend. What were you jealous another person was into him? Second for thinking a girl was trashy for being into him. You need to apologize.", "Anytime I see someone on here describe something as a harmless joke, I know it's a cop out. It harmed him.

Definitely TAH", "YTA and superficial.", "YTA\n\nThat was a really mean and snide thing to say.  \n\nYou knew this is something he feels insecure about.  You knew she would ask what you meant.  You were trying to sabotage the situation rather than be happy for him.\n\nThen to brush it off as a joke.  Funny thing is no one else seems to be laughing. \n\nPretty shitty friend you are OP.  Time to have a long hard look at yourself and why you decided to behave like that.", "YTA\u2026and you have the stones to call the other girls behavior \u2019trashy\u2019?", "What a shitty thing to say.

You're a massive AH.", "YTA. It was not a harmless joke. You said that when he was fat he was undesirable and that you considered him to be so.", "YTA because you made it seem as if James wasn't worthy of having a companion because of his weight.

I'm a little bigger myself and I'd be absolutely mortified if my friends said that now that I've started losing weight.\n\nThat's going to cut deeply for him and even if you apologise, which I sincerely hope you have, it's going to haunt him for a while.\n\nYou're the absolute asshole, op", "YTA.

I'm gonna bring that up anytime someone threatens to boost your confidence so you never get over it. - That's what you did.", "YTA\n\nThat's a pretty insulting thing to say to and in front of a stranger who was interested in him.

Inside out ugly is the worst ugly there is.", "YTA, the comment was unnecessary.\n\nI'm hoping James doesn't have some secret feelings for you, because if he does they're certainly gone now after that shallow comment :/\n\nSounds like your little green monster showed up because another girl gave him attention.", "YTA. \n\nThat \u00ab\u00a0joke\u00a0\u00bb was not warranted at all and I\u2019m amazed at the mental gymnastics you had to do to bring his weight into the conversation. \n\nPlease get over your ridiculous self.", "Holy shit you are such an asshole oh my god. You literally said - in different words - my friend was worthless when he was fat, so of course he wouldn\u2019t be worth dating, but now he\u2019s worth dating because he\u2019s lost weight.\n\nYou didn\u2019t make a joke.

Funny that you\u2019re apparently so insecure you have to take digs at your pals\u2026 How have *you* grown in the last year, huh?\n\nEdit: oh I fully missed the part where you were helping him until he got confident enough to work out alone.

Trust me honey, after that comment, everyone knows who the \u2018ugly\u2019 person is.", "YTA. Mostly for the joke, but also for clearly thinking that it's impossible to be both overweight and hot. Which, as someone who is very overweight, is something we struggle with all. the. time, and that makes us suffer horribly. People can be overweight and still be a 10/10.\n\nBut maybe people would never have assumed you were a couple before because they know how shallow you are?", "YTA and you sound jealous", "So you made a joke at the expense of a friend.\n\nYou essentially fatshamed someone for no reason.\n\nYou can't tell if this friend is actually upset because you say he > seemed to have gotten his feelings hurt\n\n\nGosh this a difficult one.

Around 7-8 months ago he decided to change his lifestyle and be healthier. He was overweight but already lost a lot of weight and fitter. I was his workout/motivation buddy throughout these months but lately he\u2019s been confident enough to do his own thing. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we went to a friends party (it wasn\u2019t really a party, more of a low key get together). James is shy/awkward and tends to stick with me whenever we go to social environments with lots of people. But at some point this (tipsy) girl came up to him and seemed clearly interested. She was ignoring me *entirely*. I was about to walk off when she asked me -in front of several others - if James and I are a together.\n\nI laughed and joked that she wouldn\u2019t have asked me this if she had seen him last year. I was immediately told by some friends that it was a mean thing to say, and in hindsight James seemed a little speechless. The girl asked me what I meant and I explained that he used to be way chubbier. Then she shrugged and said he\u2019s \u201chot\u201d and would take him off me if I didn\u2019t mind. I thought this was trashy and just left. \n\nAfterwards I spoke to James in private and he seemed to have gotten his feelings hurt. I explained it was just a joke cos last year NOBODY would\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re together. I mean the whole point of the joke was that he\u2019s considered more attractive *now* but I know his true awkward self and past. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "It sounds like your comments at the party may have come across as insensitive to James. While your intention may have been to joke and acknowledge his weight loss journey, it's possible that your words came across as mean or hurtful.  \nIt's important to remember that people's self-esteem and confidence can be deeply tied to their appearance and weight, so making comments about someone's past physical appearance, even if meant in jest, can be damaging.  \nIt's great that you had a private conversation with James to try to clear things up, but it's important to consider how your words and actions may impact those around you, especially those who are close to you. If you're not sure whether your words or actions may be hurtful, it's always a good idea to err on the side of caution and speak kindly.", "YTA!!!!", "It was backhanded, but i dont believe you quite understand why it is backhanded and that you actually tried to \u00abcompliment\u00bb his recent changes.

I was lucky as that's not a common thing most like your friend wouldn't have felt they were good enough.\n\nTalk to him again and say that it wasn't an attack on him or his personality, reassure him that he is unbelievably amazing as a person. \n\n\nCould your friend have feelings for You also?

I thought this was trashy and just left.  \n>  \n>I explained it was just a joke cos last year NOBODY would\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re together.\n\n**YTA.**\n\nThis was not harmless. **You blatantly hurt him** by pointing out how unattractive he was until he got fit. **You did it because you were pissed that you were ignored by a girl** that was expressing interest in him, and **you could have entirely ruined an opportunity for your shy and awkward friend to meet someone not as shallow as you.**\n\nMaybe your friend is shy and awkward because you keep dragging him down whenever he starts to socialize. He is not your property. I can not imagine how highly you think of yourself in order to post here and actually believe you could possibly be anything other than the asshole - If this is not a troll post, then **you are toxic and the only trashy person in this scenario.**", "YTA......never in that conversation was what he looked liked last year brought up. She asked if you were together NOW! And you're lucky if he's still your friend.", "So, you were upset that some random woman wasn't interested in you, so you decided to verbally attack the guy she was interested in. A guy that was supposed to be your friend, a guy who trusted you, a guy you should have been excited for when a woman took notice of him and should have been supportive of. \n\nYes, YTA. \n\nYou are not a friend of James. You are not better than James. You do not have the right to this woman's affection, nor do you deserve any woman's interest more than James does.", "YTA\nKudos to you for helping him get healthy.  \n\nBut it's very disappointing that you'd throw his old body in his face because the girl ignored you entirely.", "Yes, YTA, you hurt him so much. :(", "OP I can tell you're in self defense mode. Maybe take a few hours and step away from this because the comments aren't going to get any nicer for you. I promise you, the more you argue, the meaner people will get. Guarantee it. It won't be productive for you or anyone. I highly suggest you take a break from this and go work on some emotional processing.", "YTA!!! What a terrible \u201cfriend\u201d not sure what makes you feel so superior. Body shammers like you are the worst. He deserves so much more in a friend.", "Sometimes I wonder if people really do need to be told.", "Full agree, James you take that girl on a date. She came up to flirt with you and when your trashy friend tried to shame you in front of her she shot her down immediately, she's a keeper. OP is absolutely not.", "And 3 for publicly highlighting his insecurities at a moment when he was probably getting a huge ego boost after a lot of hard work. Like heaven forbid the poor man actually get an iota of self esteem, OP had to cut him down fast.", "Exactly! You saying that \"NOBODY\" would assume you were together with James says a lot about you as a person. You're basically saying that when he was less fit nobody would assume him being in a relationship, with you \"the hot / fit/ attractive guy\". You are so full of yourself, I wouldnt want you as my friend.\n\nYTA. Definitely.", "Yeah I agree OP YTA. \nThat\u2019s such a mean thing to say to someone, let alone someone you call a friend. I hope that guy finds a new friend who thinks he\u2019s worthy of respect no matter what he looks like. \nEw", "YTA OP. You were jealous that someone was talking to your pet. As in, you thought that your pet project had a crush on you and now, it turns out, others are interested in him as a person and not an ego boost.", "Worse than that - at one time he was fat so he's *never* going to be worthy of it.", "I mean, I was pretty sure what the answer was going to be just from the word \"harmless\" in the title..", "If she wanted to make sure James is never interested in her romantically she's doing a great job.", "I knew the moment I read that title it wasn\u2019t a harmless joke. She wouldn\u2019t be posting here if it was.", "How is just saying something nasty that you believe to be true a \"joke\"? Do you not understand what a joke is OP? \n\nYTA", "Right? I had her pegged in the title.", "If you feel like you have to describe your \"joke\" as \"harmless\", then you are trying to invalidate the response of the target of the joke.", "Here's another harmless joke OP - that girl wouldn't have asked that if she knew what a mean, jealous AH you are. \n\nAnd yeah, massive YTA.", "I got second hand embarrassment just from reading this. OP, YTA and a huge one at that. Oh, feel free to refer to him as your \u201cex-friend\u201d. I am pretty sure he will be shedding you in his journey for better health.", "This. I hope James and this girl get married. And then you will be on Reddit asking why you weren\u2019t invited. People can change. He changed his body. Maybe you can work on your personality. Also, YTA", "100% accurate assessment", "Right? Sanitation workers are the only ones picking this girl up.", "Literally \ud83e\udd23 So jealous of idea of \"trashy\" girl getting with him", "Lots of fat people are also in very happy relationships, so yeah OP, YTA on so many levels.", "right? I'm impressed & I hope they hit it off \ud83d\udc95 happy valentine's day OP, YTA.", "Yaaas! She's got the game. She's confident and classy. I love that. Def a keeper!", "gosh no. he deserves so much better than that nasty woman who clearly thinks she's oh-so superior", "Something tells me that if any jOkEs had been made about her appearance or a sensitive time in her past, she would have lost her shit. \n\nI guess it\u2019s only okay to take cheap shots at other people, even when the situation unfolding has almost nothing to do with her. The other girl asked if they were together OUT OF RESPECT. That is the opposite of being trashy.", "The way she talks about the girl (ignoring me, trashy) and the way she tried to deter the girl from hims makes it seems like she is interested in James.", "Right? I'm definitely on the thicker side, and my spouse is quite thin. It's just our natural body types. Never stopped us from being together or from them finding me attractive. People make shitty \"jokes\" about my looks and them being \"out of my league\" all the time, with clear intention of trying to make me feel bad and beneath them. It used to get under my skin, but at the end of the day, my spouse's opinion on my attractiveness matters way more than random shitty people. \n\nI hope James finds better friends who won't make shitty comments and aren't so very fatphobic.", "Right? Big guys (and gals) are hot and people can deal. Also, as someone who's been overweight and underweight and everything in between, it isn't actually a compliment when someone insults the way you used to look. Every version of you is a part of you forever, and plenty of folks lose weight and then gain it back.", "I wonder how she spoke to him then vs how she speaks to him now. Hopefully, he\u2019s completely ignoring her and finding a new friend\u2026and having some really good sex.", "It\u2019s extremely typical of a straight sized person to consider themselves entitled to fat bodies, to comment on them, devalue them until they \u2018look right\u2019, and happily tell them they thought less of them until they lost weight.", "I\u2019m cracking up! And so true\ud83d\ude2dwhere\u2019s a bus when you need one!", "Are they good friends though?", "Not a friend, a user.", "That comment is going to stick in his head and cause him to have even more self-worth issues. I'm sure he's gotten a lot of comments like this for many years. A comment like this is basically ensuring that in future relationships, he's going to wonder if his partner would still want to be with him if he hadn't lost the weight. Which of course means that if he ever puts the weight back on, which is often the case, he's going to have serious anxiety about romantic relationships. \"Jokes\" like this really stick, especially since it's very rarely the only comment of this sort he will get.", ">If that was said about me in front of a girl interested in me I would think you just said that to put her off\n\nI have a feeling that this is what he was doing and it's funny if OP thinks that by downplaying his friend and insulting him that the woman will go to OP instead.", "Right? The passive language just adds to her being a jerk", "I just left a comment like this. Worst bit for me. Like OP wasn\u2019t even involved but came back into the room to find out something had happened in her absence.", "Absolutely! My wife is obese and struggles significantly with body dysmorphia. I personally am so glad she is no longer anorexic and bulimic, as I feel at least over eating is a bit healthier. She just get down about her swinging so far the other direction. I am personally proud of her. But also, I think she is the sexiest woman on this Earth. I don't know why but when I see her I am like \"hot damn, I am lucky\". Sure I can see another woman and think the look good. But something about my wife just moves my soul!", "Fantastic response!", "Yeah like \u201csee? Girls are evil and they\u2019re shallow too!\u201d", "Implied", "She sounds spiteful. And jealous. \n\n>She was ignoring me entirely  \n>  \n>I thought this was trashy\n\nIf this isn't jealousy, I don't know what is.\n\nAlso,\n\n>Then she shrugged and said he\u2019s \u201chot\u201d\n\nWhat is with the \"\"? \n\nIsn't that jealousy?", "and 4, for being super dismissive with the 'he seems to have gotten his feelings hurt' - no shred of accountability. nasty woman. \\[grammar edit\\]", "Also, can you sense the vibe of \"you're in this state because of me\" from OP. I'm sort of getting that as she mentioned that she was the \"coach and motivator\" for the past few months.\n\nSo, as soon as he got a sliver of attention, she had to ruin it. I hope the friend just let go of OP. She's toxic", "Agreed. OP seemed kinda...insulted that someone could assume they were together. Like..\nRude much? \n\nYTA big time.", "I certainly hope so. James needs new friends. Real friends who actually care about him.", "Agreed! I hope James sees her for what she is and goes on to lose another 120 pounds. She\u2019s just bitter at this point and he\u2019s much better off without her.", "And only because it's their job", "Exactly. OP thinks it's okay to bash someone when they get a vote of confidence. \"Its a joke\" my ass. Just a jealous petty woman .", "Or the girl. Maybe she put him down because the girl was interested in James and not her.", "It felt apt :)", "Clearly not with a comment like that.", "OP is female. \nShe could just be jealous another girl has interest in him", "Exactly. I'm obviously sorry your wife has struggled so much, in both directions, but I'm glad she at least has you who loves her and finds her attractive just as she is.\n\nIt really rubs me the wrong way when people act as if a person is suddenly ugly or unattractive if they're overweight. It's just not true. Beauty comes in all sizes.", "Aww your wife is lucky to have someone so supportive", "Like it\u2019s some gotchya that every human has the potential to be shitty.", "She sounds like she's had the privilege of looking \"hot\" without trying much.", "Right?!?! Like I find my husband hot even though he isn\u2019t conventionally attractive. He can give me a look that makes my knees weak! His touch, even just holding my hand, makes me see stars! His laugh makes my heart skip a beat! He is so hot to me!", "As a sanitation worker I can confirm this statement", "Or jealous that she\u2019s not getting credit for his body", "How far will physical \"hotness\" take her, with a shit personality?", "Apparently far enough that other people's emotions aren't important.", "My thoughts exactly.\nBeing 'hot' is one thing but I'm pretty sure all the shit OP talks makes her ugly.", "She will have to touch grass sooner than later because her Holier than Thou attitude will land her smack down on the ground."]}
