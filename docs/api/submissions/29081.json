We've always wanted to have kids, but we've been struggling. We've been trying for about 6 years now, and we've had a few miscarriages along the way. After every miscarriage, she's wanted to have another baby, and she would get pregnant... then there would be another miscarriage. 2 months ago, I was cleaning out the bathroom when I found a pregnancy test in the trash. It was positive.\n\nA feeling I hadn't gotten before came across me and it was dreed. I didn't want to go through it again, and I didn't want my wife to go through it again. I didn't say anything about it, and I noticed that she also did not say anything about it. In the past time, she always got really stressed after finding out. She was not stressed at all.\n\nThis led me to believe that she didn't look at, or didn't read the test right. I contemplated just asking her. But then I thought about if she really didn't know, all the stress that would bring her. I decided just not to talk about it.\n\nIn the past, my wife had been so stressed every pregnancy after we lost the first. She would cry herself to sleep at night, and she would snap at me all the time. I know that she's really worried about not being able to have a child. That was my reasoning behind it. If she really didn't know, I didn't want to get her hopes up, in case it was another miscarriage. I thought it might be better to wait until she was further along in the pregnancy.\n\nAfter about a week and a half she started complaining about cramps and a few times threw up. She joked about being pregnant again (which she would never do if she knew she was pregnant), and at that point I knew that she really didn't know. I kept it a secret for a few weeks.\n\nI think she started putting two and two together and started to stress out. She didn't flat out say to me that she thought she was pregnant, but I knew the signs.\n\nTwo weeks after I found the pregnancy test, she took another one and it was positive. She went back into her pregnancy-induced panic attacks. I felt horrible.\n\nThe next day I told her that I knew. She was the most mad I've ever seen her. Called me a horrible husband and that she didn't want to have kids with me. She went to stay at her mom's place around an hour away.\n\nI feel awful. I feel like this could have all been avoided if I just had talked to her when I saw the pregnancy test. I don't think that she will be mad forever, and I think I can heal the relationship, though I really feel horrible for what I have done.", "created_utc": 1697510499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179o3j1/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_she_was_pregnant/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Every pregnancy test I\u2019ve seen says not to read them if they\u2019ve been sitting for too long because they can develop a false positive after too much time has past. You might have actually seen a negative test that sat out for too long and this one is her first positive.", "This may be an unpopular opinion, but YTA for admitting you knew.

It you read the result after 10 minutes, it isn\u2019t reliable. It could have been a false positive. However, this is something you should have considered before declaring you knew she was definitely pregnant. It\u2019s possible the test did read negative in the time frame bc of how early she tested but turned darker later. This has happened to me before.

If you weren\u2019t going to say anything when you found it, why say anything after the fact? Plus, depending on how old the test was it may not have been accurate when you read it. I get not saying anything, but you should have taken that to your grave.", "NAH.  Im saying this because of the trauma from your prior losses.

What if she has been ignoring the prenatal vitamins or drinking too much caffeine? What if she has been eating sushi or drinking alcohol without even thinking about it?  Is saving her a few days of stress worth the risk?", "NTA you have no idea when that test was taken and results of pregnancy tests are not always necessarily valid after a few hours. The stress she experiences also isn't good for pregnancy. It makes absolute sense that you didn't say anything at first. Although it really doesn't make sense to me that you told her at all lol", "NTA I understand why you did what you did and I also understand the pain of watching someone want something so badly that it seems they can't have it. They love that child from the moment they know they are caring and losing it is devastating.  With that being said you BOTH really need to be in therapy together and separately.", "Yta. During the first few few weeks of pregnancy- it\u2019s a crucial time. How you treat your body put in your body. What if she had gone out for a drink? Been feeling a lot of pain and taking meds to deal with it.  There are so many factors here. What if was an ectopic pregnancy and she blew off the pain as something else? There are foods to avoid there are just so many things.

NTA, but man, you should have said something right away or not at all.\n\nAs someone who is compulsively honest, I think after staying quiet that long it would have been best not to say anything. I think it was a neutral choice not to say anything in the first place, as it could have been a late developing false positive.\n\nHopefully she was just feeling overwhelmed and you can have a proper talk soon. Much luck with the pregnancy!", "Your wife needs therapy. Now. You too, probably.\nThere comes a point when you realize it's not happening. It's too much to keep trying. \nI've had 4 die at 16-20 weeks. It destroyed me for a bit. Then I accepted it.", "INFO. Is there any way your explanation of why you didn't tell her about the results could be misunderstood as you blaming her for the miscarriages? Did it sound like you were saying you don't think the pregnancy will make it to full term like the others didn't?\n\nYou need to rethink whatever you said to her to make sure nothing came out horribly wrong. I don't see why she would leave the home unless she thinks you blame her and/ doubt her ability to have a baby.", "I say you're both a soft YTA and that you both need therapy. You both hid things from each other in an attempt to cope. You can't shelter her from her own feelings babe you just can't..As hard as it is to see her suffer. She deserves to know things because its her body thats gonna carry and pop out that baby. However her exploding on you wasn't right either. She's obviously very sensitive and can't deal with her trauma and instead lashes out poor girl. I also think she seems a little too obsessed with having her own child. Trying to keep getting pregnant after a miscarriage won't make her happy with herself. You two just need to take some time for yourselves instead of worrying about getting pregnant. Have fun just the two of you. Have a picnic or go to a drive in movie or something. So you can appreciate each other again <3 even if it means you won't ever have a biological child", "NTA.  So your wife took another pregnancy test and threw it away without telling you she had taken one or her perception of its result.  She kept this a secret from you.  You discovered the test in the trash and, since she said nothing to you, did not confront her about her secrecy.  You ultimately determined she was pregnant, failed to tell you her knowledge of the test, and her secrecy at taking one.  When she announced she was pregnant, you disclosed your knowledge of her earlier subterfuge/incompetence and she got mad at you.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - That\u2019s some twisted logic. You hiding your wife\u2019s pregnancy from her?? Seriously? She needs to get some counseling ASAP to help control the stress, which is clearly not healthy for anyone.", "YTA. Go talk to your wife and ask her about the test you found. Bring flowers or whatever she loves. But stay away from anything baby related, just in case she loses it before she can tell you. \n\n If she won\u2019t talk try her mom. \n\nBut find out first about the test results changing with that specific brand. But don\u2019t use it as an excuse during your apology.", "NTA, but you should never have told her that you knew. \nHonestly it\u2019s a shame she found out. The level of stress and anxiety she\u2019s under is not good for her and not good for the fetus.", "YTA. I understand you've had traumatic experiences here, and I'm not blaming you for feeling that dread, but it's your wife's body the child is growing in, not yours; she has the right to know, no matter how you feel about it.", "YTA. I get that you thought you were helping... but how would not knowing she was pregnant help if you were expecting a miscarriage? She would have noticed that. And if she knew she was, she'd likely be more careful. You should have told her you saw it, that the test was positive, and then gotten her some therapy, you both some therapy to deal with all of the stress and angst you'd both be feeling.", "NTA. I feel like she would have known from the test she evidently took/having been pregnant before. She might have been in denial from all of her past trauma related to pregnancy so she displaced her feelings towards you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong because for all you knew it was an old/expired test. The onus is not on you to tell someone what\u2019s happening with their body when they took a test to find out and left it for you to find. Either way it seems like her reaction would be the same due to her trauma with the subject.", "NTA. Why would this make you TA at all? Do not take this misguided blame on and allow this to become something she bashes you over the head with for the rest of your life. Couples counseling/individual therapy.", "YTA I'm a bit shocked at the number of people saying you aren't. She obviously misread the test, and you kept that from her. Think of all the things that could have gone wrong from that point. She might have drank alcohol, smoked, done drugs (legal or not), and possibly caused all sorts of harm to the pregnancy. And what if it was an ectopic pregnancy or something. You put your wife and unborn child at risk by keeping quiet. I don't think healing the relationship is going to be as easy as you think.", "Waiting too long renders the test invalid. But why would your wife throw out a test she took without looking? Or not read it right? This story doesn\u2019t make sense on several levels. \nYTA. You should have told her right away. Telling her now added nothing.", "YTA, none of what you did makes any sense, don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d lie and hide it and then ultimately don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d admit it and tell her you\u2019ve been hiding it, if you were gonna do that then why hide it in the first place? Very strange behaviour and I completely understand her anger", "Not the asshole. She did not tell you. Plain and simple. Therefore you had a hunch but were respecting her privacy.", "Literally could have said nothing and there would have been no issue. You shot yourself in the foot and caused this issue yourself. YTA", "I would suggest have a talk with her. I think in pregnancy mood swings happens quite often so you should tell her your point of view.", "YTA she\u2019s dealing with trauma.  I don\u2019t think she didn\u2019t know, I think she knew but wasn\u2019t ready for it to be real, maybe it was early on and she needed another to be sure.  She may also not be so furious that you know, but there\u2019s also a way in which you knowing changes things.", "Nta, loose loose situation.", "You had good intentions to want to protect her feelings but you had no right.", "NTA. Honestly you should have just kept it to yourself. She didn\u2019t need to know that you already knew. But her reaction is over the top. I think she could really benefit from some counseling.", "YTA. I hope she\u2019s got a good support system and was already open to therapy because she\u2019ll definitely need it now", "Yta.", "I know this wasn't intentional, but by withholding this from her to prevent her stressing, you were indirectly implying that she was responsible for the previous miscarriages with her stress. So, yeah,  YTA. I can't imagine how this must have made her feel", "NTA\n\nShe's the one who took the test. How could you possibly know that she didn't check the results??? Then you tried to honor her wishes of not talking about it\n\nAnyone in here blaming you either simply hate men, or are complete morons\n\nGet some grief counselling together, and learn some coping mechanisms to try to keep the stress of this pregnancy as low as possible\n\nGood luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Regardless, going through multiple miscarriages is a terribly dark experience. I suspect the intense anxiety your wife is feeling now she knows she\u2019s pregnant again is complicated by her own feelings of \u201cinadequacy.\u201d I kinda wonder if she interpreted your decision not to tell her you knew as confirmation that you knew she would \u201cfail\u201d you again by not \u201cbeing able\u201d to carry the baby to term. And of course she\u2019s not failing you! Or anyone! But being a woman is so intensely linked to motherhood that many women who experience infertility feel fundamentally broken.

Not for the intention of divorce, but to reassess themselves and the relationship. The pressure she's putting on herself is too much, and it sounds like trying to have a child is taking up a lot of the focus of the relationship. Separate, go on dates without sex being a part of it (so there's no accidents or pressure on either of them), refocus on each other, then determine if they have to have kids in the equation.

Plenty of people don't know they are pregnant for two or three months and have a ham sandwich or miss early scans. Or tests can be wrong (this one was old and probably inaccurate by then anyway). There's little a doctor will be doing for you in the first couple months anyway unless you're actively in a fertility treatment program - and in that case OP's wife would have already been receiving monitoring and care.\n\nI don't think OP's choices were necessarily right but why is everyone here being dramatic about ectopic pregnancies.", "If you think they\u2019re both assholes the judgment is ESH for Everyone Sucks Here", "What?! I must have taken quite literally hundreds of negative pregnancy test over the past 10ish years. I have rarely told my husband about them because there's nothing of interest about a negative pregnancy test. It's not subterfuge. \n\nIt's also not incompetence. Sometimes pregnancy tests can take a while to develop the second line. It probably read as negative when she threw it away.\n\nI agree that OP is NTA, though. Infertility and pregnancy loss are incredibly hard and draining on a relationship. I hope OP and his wife can both give each other some grace.", "Lol, like every four months, I take a pregnancy test because I am paranoid. Ya reckon I tell my partner every time? Ya reckon my partner would consider it *subterfuge*. Thanks for a right chuckle.", "Yes, your 100% correct. Well said.", "If she\u2019d wanted to tell him she\u2019d taken that first test, she would have. Instead she said nothing. \n\nHe accidentally found out and respected her decision not to tell him.

I\u2019m shocked that someone whose wife has been taking pregnancy tests for years wouldn\u2019t think what he was looking at was a false positive after too much time spent out.", "But didn\u2019t she hide the fact that she took a pregnancy test first?", "But then how is he an AH for keeping quite while she \u201cwasn\u2019t ready for it to be real.\u201d Didn\u2019t he essentially respect her decision to not tell him about the first test she took?", "I think realistically she knew when she took the test. The issue is more so that they\u2019re both just not able to handle their grief/trauma from their past attempts. Both of them need counseling. How is OP the AH for not telling her something she probably knew having been pregnant before? This seems more like a displacement of trauma and emotions than him actually doing anything wrong.", "Now? They both already needed it desperately", "How's this ant different from her taking a test and not telling the husband about it? Kettle calling the pot much?", "Agreed", "Straight up, your hormones, including the ones of stress (I think its called cortisol?) Are important and sensitive... you can 100% stress abort a fetus.

My period started later that day. Two weeks later I suddenly got the worst pain ever. I had a ruptured ectopic.\n\nSo this story doesn't seem entirely implausible to me. I, too, just threw it out out of fustration.", "I didn\u2019t forget but I didn\u2019t wait long enough.. I already had two kids and both times as soon as the pee hit the test the positive came up.  So when it didn\u2019t , I told my husband it was negative and I went on about my evening.  I got my boys in bed and had dinner.  My husband and I had a discussion about how it probably wasn\u2019t the best time to have another baby anyway.   ( even though we both really wanted another one ). We were getting ready for bed and my husband went to turn the lights off in the bathroom ( 3 hours later) he said , Didn\u2019t you say if this had two lines it was positive ? I said yes , he smiles at me and shows me the test and says , Happy Birthday:) ( it was also my birthday). And the test was very positive.  Ya you aren\u2019t supposed to read the test after a few minutes but I\u2019ve taken a lot of pregnancy test in my 43 years and not once no matter how long after have I saw a positive if I wasn\u2019t pregnant. And I\u2019m sure there will be 100 comments about ones that did. ( many, many times a women will be pregnant and not even know it , she will start her period and think she wasn\u2019t ) if a solid line turns up in that area , it\u2019s positive .. it\u2019s reacting to the HCG , I\u2019m not taking about a line you have to hold up to the light to see , or take a picture and change the negative 100 ways.  \nAt first you weren\u2019t the AH but weeks later after she\u2019s having symptoms and you say nothing , ya that\u2019s a little ass holish.   Just your life would be a little easier.", "Especially one who has had so many losses. Heck, I can tell you that the test in the trash would have been checked multiple times that day, regardless of how accurate it is after 2 mins! No one desperately trying to conceive would just forget about a test haha", "I took one, totally thought it said no. Came across it later, it said yes. 5 tests later, it was still a yes. Had I taken the trash out without looking again I wouldn\u2019t have given it another thought", "Within 5-10 minutes for most brands.", "It makes sense if the first test was negative then 2 weeks later she was still having symptoms. Tests aren\u2019t 100% accurate and people misread them all the time. This makes even more sense if she was trying to get pregnant, especially since it seems she\u2019s to a point of irrationality concerning the topic.", ">Unless her cycle is ALL over the place, it does not make sense to take pregnancy tests two weeks apart.\n\nNot necessarily, if it's very early (like before your period is due and i knoe women who test from the day after ovulation) and you're very, very hydrated, a test can show negative. That's why the tests suggest the best results to use first morning urine. Waiting 2 weeks could be for her period to actually show up or because she didn't really have any symptoms, and when she did, she retested.", "But that was much later. She could have read the first test as instructed after 15 mins and don\u2019t read it after an hour. So after 15 it looked negative (not enough hormones). After more than an hour it is possible to turn (false) positive. Unreliable anyway.\nThe truly positive test she took was weeks later.", "I just googled \"what happens if you wait too long to read a pregnancy test\" Cleveland Clinic, MacArthur Medical Center and Clear Blue Easy all say waiting too long can cause a false positive.", "When the test dries out, the test lines get more visible, which might be read as a faint positive.", "After a certain amount of time the tests come up with an evaporation line which can make it look positive.", "If the test is used correctly and read in the specified time. After that time it's likely for a false positive to show up on the test.", "I know from experience this really happened with pregnancy tests 30 years ago. I couldn't read at home one at first, walk-in doctor clinic test was negative, by the time I got home and looked at home stick again, it was positive.

Omitting the truth may be just as deceptive\u2026 Technically not lying.", "Except she took another one and it was positive", "If it was positive the day after, that\u2019s not a real positive. There\u2019s a reason the tests say to only read them within like 5 minutes. It\u2019s an invalid result otherwise.

That\u2019s the accent I\u2019m hearing lol and same. I\u2019m not gonna tell hubs every time I take a test.

Would\u2019ve been better off hiding the fact that he hid it or just not hid it at all and asked her straight away, very strange behaviour.

Amazing.", "I\u2019m just not sure what her reaction would be to her husband telling her he\u2019s pregnant though? I think the fact that they don\u2019t have an open line of communication regarding this issue is a bad sign for the marriage or at least there development of trauma surrounding this issue.

I felt more than confident that over , 100 years of no risk pregnancy is indicative of a strong health constitution. \n\nBesides the first couple we took were negative and I was getting depressed because I thought I was sterile thanks to my shit mother. We waited so long for the first one because of that. I mean it's pretty depressing to think you're sterile because of your abusive mother, especially when you actually want kids. \n\nBut I don't expect someone who might not have ever been abused by their family in such a way to understand the psychology of it. Lucky me I am in school for psychology so I actually can explain it.", "Agreed there been plenty of times people see a faint line but possibly could be nothing then two days later its darker."]}
