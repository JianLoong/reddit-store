Recently, Talia\u2019s dog Rex (Talia\u2019s had Rex for six years) got into a pretty bad accident and needs a surgery, which we will have to pay $6,000 for. Talia had to take out a loan as we didn\u2019t have enough to cover the cost, but we were able to get Rex the surgery he needs. \n\n\r  \nTalia started a go fund me in order to raise funds to cover the loan for the surgery. She shared it across all of her social media and wants me to share it on mine as well, but I refused. I\u2019m not a massive social media guy, I rarely post anything. I also migrated from another country a few years ago so most of my friends on social media are not Americans. In America, go fund me is very popular and useful for people to raise funds for things especially medical costs, so I completely understand the need for go fund mes. However, my culture is very different and people are not familiar with go fund me. People asking for money are mostly done discreetly and it\u2019s viewed as short of a shameful thing to ask for donation publicly on social media; it\u2019s a very class based culture that I come from. I\u2019m also the only person in my family to make it to America, so I'm already considered the 'privileged one' that made it out, and there\u2019s a lot of complications for people back home in my country seeing me post on social media asking for donations. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not like I am leaving Talia without help. I am paying for half of Rex\u2019s surgery costs every month on our payment plan. I don\u2019t care if she post on her social media. I just don\u2019t want to post on mine because that kind of things are culturally viewed very differently and 90% of people on my social media are family and friends from back home.

Go Fund Me might be popular in the US, but that doesn't mean they're not tacky and awkward. It's even more so for people who don't share your culture.  You have helped your gf pay for her dog's surgery. That's more than enough.", "NTA, you said the dog has had the surgery now? So basically she's qualified for the loan, used it already, and is now asking for money to pay it back faster?\n\nThe GoFundMe stuff really bothers me tbh. If she qualified for the loan and you are helping with the repayments it doesn't even sound like she desperately needs the help, she just wants it. I would be uncomfortable sharing the link as well.\n\nI'm in a poor financial situation with a lot of medical debt and was told by several people to make a GoFundMe and I refused. It's not as big where I live as in the US and honestly it just feels.. off. \n\nI'm not going to call you an arsehole when you're physically helping pay off the loan, just because you don't crowdfund additional money to pay it off faster.", "NTA. You are paying half of the loan payment which proves that you care about GF and her dog.  You don't need a reason beyond I don't want to.  GF should have accepted your generosity.", "NTA. I despise Go Fund Me\u2019s, don\u2019t know when it became acceptable to beg people for money for anything and everything, and by paying for half you are supporting her how much did her friends contribute?", "NTA. She is TA. You are paying half of her loan. That is very generous of you. You post what you want on social media. Her and her friends don't get to tell you what to post.", "NTA-you are paying for half of the surgery. That is very supportive. She needs pet insurance.", "Plenty of Americans find GoFundMe distasteful too, especially when the creator already secretly raised the money via other means! What\u2019s wrong with her?!", "NTA. Many people are doing it tough now, in all countries and cultures.\n\nThey may be struggling to pay their rent or feed their kids. Asking them to contribute to a $6000 operation for a dog is a tone deaf thing to do. It reeks of first world problems and entitlement.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t post this as an American. I find it tacky as well.", "NTA. But she is. Unless it\u2019s for a person who truly needs it: house fire, unexpected death (like that poor bride and her groom who got hit by the drunk girl), there\u2019s no excuse for a go fund me. She chose to have a pet. She can pay the loan. It\u2019s tacky to do a go fund me when she can afford the loan.", "NTA. Honestly, I hate Go Fund Me's and think they are trashy. She already qualified for a loan, why the heck is she asking other people to cover her costs??? People have no shame these days.", "I wouldn't do it either. If you don't want to say no....no justification needed.  Her friends can mind their own business. \n\nSome people are comfortable asking for money, asking you to buy something....some aren't.  I'm with you. You are already helping.\nThat's nice.\n\nTell her no. How she takes it may be an indication of how you two move forward.  Don't let anyone bully you.", "NTA - GoFundMe is a crowd sourcing platform for people who want to use their community to obtain funding. She was able to get a loan. It\u2019s weird to ask your friends and family to help pay off your debt. If you qualified you should have the ability to pay it off. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t share it ok my socials either. It\u2019s wack.", "You're NTA. I doubt most people actually like seeing their friends or family post those online panhandling requests. If she wants to beg her own friends for money, that's her prerogative. You shouldn't be expected to do the same.", "If she thinks you're being unsupportive, I would stop paying altogether.", "NTA. Even if you didn\u2019t have the (totally understandable) concerns about the optics with respect to your country of origin, your girlfriend has no right to try to force you to post something you\u2019re uncomfortable with. For any reason. \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t she have pet insurance?!", "NTA Gofundme is mostly scamming.", "NTA.\n \nShe should definitely have had either pet insurance or an emergency savings pot if she wants to own a dog.", "NTA\n\nIn other circumstances, I would say you should share it, but given the makeup of your friend lists and the cultural differences, this is very reasonable.", "So sick of the money grabs.  What happened to personal responsibility.", "NTA, don't post...", "NTA", "NTA", "May I suggest sending group DMs to your American friends on social media sharing the link to the GFM?  That way only they\u2019ll see them.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to ask people for money to pay her bills that's on her, why should you need to share her begging post.\n\nIf she cared so much about her dog she should have had insurance so she wouldn't need to beg people for money.", "NTA. Tell her that if you post it you won\u2019t help her with the payment anymore. One for another.", "I hate the vague my culture nonsense, and depending on the social media you may be able to determine privacy on certain posts.\n\nNAH but I think it's funny that you're embarrassing yourself in your local circle to avoid embarrassing yourself in your hometown.", "YTA. If you're worried that trying to help a sick animal will make you look bad (???) you can always adjust the privacy settings so none of those people can see it.\n\nidk maybe I'm just tired of all these /r/IATA posts that just say \"in my culture, this specific way of being an asshole is normal\" but never say which culture. it feels like an easy way to deflect criticism.", "NTA. I myself while \"complaining\" about legal fees in grandparent visitation case was told start a GoFundMe. People will help in your situation and I considered it for about 2 seconds and have managed even though money was (still is) very tight. Hopefully the worst is over and while the bleeding may have stopped it will take awhile to turn it around. Never regretted the decision.", "You're already paying for the damn dog.

My culture is also similar, where asking for money for your self or family is shameful. I could never bring myself to make or share a go fund me unless a close family member was extremely sick, the insurance money is not enough, and we had exhausted all other means.", "Facebook friend (in their 40s with a masters degree and job) just started a gofundme to buy expensive equipment for their hobby/side gig. I was gobsmacked. Apparently, I can just ask family to give me money for my hobbies (and not as a holiday/birthday present) even as a full-grown adult living in a big house with a pool (them not me).", "I agree.  I rarely find a cause worthy of contributing to a GoFundMe.  Im sorry something unfortunate happened but that is life.  Prepare for it as much as you can with an emergency savings fund and use loans, payment plans when applicable but expecting others to defer or completely offset the cost for my problems feels wrong.", "A college friend once started a GoFundMe to raise money for work they had to do on their property due to some sort of land dispute with a neighbour. Not an emergency at all, and probably something they should\u2019ve known if they\u2019d done their due diligence on the home before buying. She and her husband are both able-bodied, reasonably well-employed, and they have no children. \n\nThe cringe factor was extremely high. \n\nIt did not raise very much money. \n\nI don\u2019t know if they ever got that retaining wall built, poor souls.", "To me, it's no different than the collection that happens when someone in your church needs help and everyone puts a little something in an envelope. Or when you hear of something at your kid's school. Or the community comes together to repair something that may have burned down. Or something like that. It's just on a larger scale, and people can help those who desperately need it from around the world.\n\nI wish I had money to help some people with their GFM accounts. Some are truly heartbreaking. I've read a few stories of the ones who are raising money under massive lies. They've been found out and shut down, and money has been refunded.", "What are your thoughts on people using them for medical treatment?\n\nFor example, my dad has a late stage cancer that has metastasized. He has been working full time, plus delivering packages for FedEx and uberring on the side to afford his bills. He has insurance and has worked his entire life.  \n \nA gofundme would change his life, and likely extend it significantly. He refuses to even consider it. The US healthcare system is devastating.", "[deleted]", "He\u2019s paying for the loan so the dog is fine. I wouldn\u2019t want to clutter my social media with a gofunfme for a dog either; you should be responsible enough to finance your pet if you get yourself one.

But humility does not mean humiliation.\n\nWe can judge a GFM by the person posting it or what it's for, I suppose, but it would take the kind of person you don't want around you to judge someone for asking for actual help based around a cancer diagnosis.", "Especially when they *move away* from that culture. Was it NOT to be in a different culture or...?", "i personally would not prioritize a decluttered social media feed over my pet's health/my girlfriend's happiness", "[deleted]", "Or maybe they are just mostly using social media to stay in contact with their family and friends from their home town. For many people this is the main reason to use Facebook, for example.", "But would you get a pet when you\u2019re unable to financially secure its health?", "You are being disingenuous.\n\nThis isn't a GoFundMe where the treatment can't start until the money has been found.  The dog is treated so the money is no longer \"for her sick dog\".  Paying 50% of the bill for GF's dog is over and above already.", "FB, a platform you can alter who can and cannot see your posts down to the individual?
