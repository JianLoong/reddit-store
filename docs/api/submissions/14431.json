When i (34M) was 20, i had a relationship with a girl, let's call her Clara. When she got pregnant, i honestly wasn't happy, but since she was decided to keep the baby there wasn't anything i could do. When our daughter, let's say Sadie (13F) was born, i legally recognized her. We have shared custody, and she stays with me 2 weekends a month. I also pay child support. I go to her school events, holidays etc. But if i'm honest, i don't feel like i love her and i know that that makes me the AH. I care about her, but i don't miss her when she is not with me and i don't feel the need to see her.\n\n 6 years ago i met my wife, Anna, and it was love at first sight (side note : me and clara weren't in a relationship since sadie was born, so no cheating). Clara and sadie both disliked my wife, but that didn't stopped me and we got married. We now have 2 kids, 4M and 2F. With my younger kids it was completely different for me, i loved since the first moment i knew they existed and that love grows every day since they were born. \n\nSadie comes to our house 2 weekends a month, but she hates my wife and my toddlers. I don't allow her to speak badly to them, i told her she has the right to not have a relationship with them, but she has to respect them. My wife has no problem with sadie and never complained about her. My kids mostly ignore her, but they act like this with everyone who won't play with them, since at this age they don't have other interests.\n\nMy half sister, who is a friend of Clara, came to visit us and stayed with us for a few days. My HS doesn't like my wife because she wanted me to marry clara. We were nc for a few years, but my wife, who wants everyone to have a good relationship, convinced me to let her back into our lives.\n \nBefore leaving she got in a fight with me, saying that i coddle my 2yo way too much and how horrible i'm for not doing that for sadie too. It is true that my 2yo is a total daddy's girl and if i'm home she always follows me around and wants to be near me. She often asks for cuddles and hugs and i'm happy to give them to her. Same with my son, but my sister wasn't disturbed by me cuddling my son, just my daughter. She was always obssesed by daddy's girl figure, since she was never that with my dad (long story). \n\nShe said i'm an AH, because since sadie wasn't a daddy's girl,  my 2yo shouldn't be either. I told her that while i'm not a good father for sadie, even  if i'm and always was present in her life, it doesn't mean that i shouldn't love my youngest daughter. Am i the asshole for coddling my 2yo, even if i didn't do the same for my oldest??", "created_utc": 1681108456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h9pa9/aita_for_coddling_my_2yo_when_i_didnt_do_the_same/", "score": 6237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I see that as being the real issue. You say you have been feeling the difference, so do something about it so you can be more of a dad than a father.  For me this is where you are the AH. The other stuff is just noise.", "Yta and you know it. No one cares about you cuddling your second daughter. Everyone cares about the trashy way you treat your oldest IN COMPARISON. Be a better man. Ugh.\n\nBtw, as a second daughter who WAS the loved one - I saw the disparity in how my dad treated me versus my half sister. And I no longer speak to him. So he lost his chance with both daughters to have a \"daddy's girl\".", "My take on this situation is that for 9 years (before you had your first loved child), Sadie assumed your lack of affection and only doing what you were supposed to do as a parent to avoid being called a deadbeat dad, was just how you are as a parent.  Then you have a son and Sadie realizes that you are capable of being a loving father,  just not to her. She is an afterthought and an obligation to you, not a loved child.  Her existence isn't her fault but you certainly blame her for it. \n\nYou say yourself that you don't love her. Why are you torturing her by forcing her to see you play \"happy families\" with the kids you wanted by continuing to have shared custody? YTA", ">But if i'm honest, i don't feel like i love her (...) I care about her, but i don't miss her when she is not with me and i don't feel the need to see her.\n\nSadie knows this. She feels it deep down in her heart even if she might not be able to put it into words. It is heartbreaking...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Sadie comes to our house 2 weekends a month, but she hates my wife and my toddlers. \n\nHave you ever wondered why? Did it cross your mind it might have to do with the first quote above? They are competition for her dads attention when she already felt you did not love her. \n\nNo money, museum visits or other material things can make up for not feeling loved. From your responses I can gather you really do not get this. You keep mentioning all the good things you did and do for Sadie. Yes, it is wonderful you spend time with her at museums. It really is. BUT... she still knows you do not love her, not like you love your younger children. That is scarring her. So YTA. \n\nThe question is: Do you want to change this? Do you want to have the same relationship with Sadie you have with your younger children? Do you want to feel the same love for her? Do you want her to feel the same love from you? \n\nAsked differently: Imagine the love you feel for your younger two children is gone. Imagine what that would feel like for you, knowing what you are missing. Imagine what that would feel like for them, them knowing what they are missing. Really feel this. And then realize this is what Sadie feels deep down, even if she cannot put it into words. \n\nI hope you do want to change this. Love is a verb. It needs work and if you want this type of love to develop between you and Sadie, you'll have to work on it. You might also want to seek professionel help to help you do this.", "You come here saying you don't feel love for your oldest child, and expect anything other than YTA as a judgment? Do you think she can't tell? She can. I feel terrible for her.", "YTA.\nYou\u2019re aware that you\u2019re playing favourites and making excuses for it.\nWhat do you do during your daughter\u2019s visits to attempt to foster a relationship with her?

I can\u2019t imagine that she\u2019s willfully visiting given that she doesn\u2019t like your wife and kids (who could blame her, you showed her who was more important).\n\nBecause if she doesn\u2019t want to be there you are *KNOWINGLY* and *WILLFULLY* subjecting her to this cruel torment of watching you *love your other children* when she knows you don\u2019t feel the same for her, because honestly, with this setup how could she fucking not?\n\nI rarely ever do this, but you should be ashamed of yourself, this is truly appalling.", "Yes, YTA for giving unequal treatment among your children. In my eyes, I see that Sadie is inconvenient for you and meddles with your \u201cperfect\u201d family. \n\nShe didn\u2019t ask to be born and she clearly feels your cold nature towards her. The pain to feel rejected by her own father will damage her for life. You may be there monetarily or in body, but you aren\u2019t giving her love, something that cannot be bought. Do better and be more fair.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the upvotes and rewards. I also just wanted to add onto my initial message that equalizing things doesn\u2019t mean being less affectionate towards the two year old toddler. I believe that being more fair means acknowledging Sadie\u2019s feelings and understanding how she knows where your priorities are (how you prefer your other children). OP should absolutely not be more cold towards his other children-two wrongs do not make a right.", "YTA. Your daughter knows you don't love her as much, and it can mess with her emotions and her self worth for the rest of her life. And by your comments it seems like you don't care.

You have three children, but you only love two of them. Poor Sadie", "YTA for how you treated/treat Sadie, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be a good father for your younger daughter. With her, you are doing great and the real problem is that you didn't give Sadie the same treatment.\n\nYou can't change the past, but you can't punish your youngest for your own mistakes. I suspect the difference between Sadie and your \"daddy's girl\" will get bigger and bigger in the future. Could you try to fix this? Maybe connect with Sadie without your new family, trying to know her as a young soon to be woman, and not an annoying, unwanted child? I don't know if this is possible, but a real question is: do you want to save a relationship wit Sadie or is it convenient for you when she's becoming distant and cold?", "So\u2026 you admit you\u2019re a deadbeat dad and you\u2019re still wondering if you\u2019re the asshole? \n\nI hope Sadie can heal from the emotional trauma of having a father who clearly didn\u2019t want her, likes to remind her of that every chance he gets and doesn\u2019t want her in his life. Yeah, fucking YTA.", "You're beyond asshole.", "YTA. I feel so so so sorry for Sadie. The lifetime of trauma/poor self-esteem you\u2019re inflicting on that girl daily will never be reversed. Can\u2019t you just fake it? Or go to a therapist or something to figure out why you resent her for the choices your horny 20 year old self made? You honestly don\u2019t even understand people\u2019s perspectives. And you write things like \u2018my wife doesn\u2019t complain\u2019 as if that will ever be a good statement to make.

She's going to grow up with daddy issues because of how you blindly reject her. She already knows you rejected her mother, she's been feeling rejected and unwanted her whole life, and now that she's a teen those feelings, due to your coldness, are going to blossom into something so ugly and sad...\n\n\nYou have to at least try, do some counselling together.", "Wow you\u2019re cruel. \n\nTossing that little girl scraps of required parental presence whilst giving your other children all your love. That\u2019s cold af. \n\n\nYTA and your daughter deserves better", "YTA and stop denying it. Just read your own post. Yes you do things with her, but your emotionally unavailable to her. You say it yourself. Paying child support doesn't make you less of a deadbeat for that alone.

Whether or not you fall 'head over heels' for another is irrelevant. Whether you wanted a child or not becomes irrelevant. She's a part of you, she's a result of your decision to have sex and she needs a father. The end. As an adult, you work on your feelings...you recognise which parts of your perception and behaviour aren't conducive to a strong father-daughter relationship and you fix it. \n\nCoddling your two year old isn't the issue - your current  family isn't the issue.

It's a BABY. That's basically their major need at that age.\n2. Poor Sadie. She deserves better from you. You're the only father she has. She's not stupid. She can see the favoritism plain as day. Frankly, she deserves better in general.\n3. I've got a dad who actually was absent most of my life. Had me young just like you did, and then a few years later started his REAL family. When I finally met him he told me straight up that he wasn't a good father. And I thought at the time that it meant he would try harder. What it really meant is that he saw no reason to try at all as he saw bad as something he was. These wounds manifest differently in each of our lives, but they show up sure enough. In fact, your oldest girl is at about the same age I was when I started cutting myself, and ripping out my hair, starving myself, and forcing myself to vomit all the time. Anything to be perfect and to contain my hurt and rage from rejection.  If you don't want to be spending your visitation days inside a mental hospital, I'd start thinking long and hard about how the two of you can start bonding more and having a REAL relationship.

My dad sounds a lot like you. He had 3 daughter from his first marriage, all much older than I am.

He became a stay at home dad, and honestly, I was spoiled as hell. A lot of stuff has happened since then. \n\nThe animosity between by my half-sisters and I has grown to such an extent, that I have had to go NC with all of them. \n\nI sympathise with Sadie because I can only imagine the pain she must be feeling by having an absent and unreachable dad. \n\nI will go YTA, simply because you could have done better. You HAVE TO do better.", "Everyone coming down on OP like he\u2019s a deadbeat. Does anyone know what a deadbeat parent is like?? OP is at least trying. He makes a point to spend one on one time with his oldest doing things she enjoys (which her own mom won\u2019t take her to do; museums), shows up to her important events and they spend holidays together. Quality time is huge. \n\nI think he had a rough go in the beginning with her. He was put into a parental roll before he was ready, but he didn\u2019t abandon her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect he might have different feelings in that situation vs having kids when he was ready with a woman he loves. It\u2019s not the same. It doesn\u2019t make the relationship with his daughter doomed. \n\nJust because it will take more work to love the same doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen.

Your half-sister is not being reasonable.\n\nThat being said, I think you realize, and are right to feel bad about, not loving Sadie in the same way you love the younger two. You can\u2019t change the past, but maybe you can work at getting to know your oldest child better and developing more of a relationship with her. What can you do to make her feel that you value and cherish her?  Are there things you can do together that don\u2019t involve your wife or the younger kids? Is there an interest you share or an interest of hers you might get into?

Even in families where the parents stay together and love each other, the elder kid(s) don\u2019t have the same relation with the parents as the younger ones because the parents change as they get older. Your relationship with your older child is not doomed.

When i (34M) was 20, i had a relationship with a girl, let's call her Clara. When she got pregnant, i honestly wasn't happy, but since she was decided to keep the baby there wasn't anything i could do. When our daughter, let's say Sadie (13F) was born, i legally recognized her. We have shared custody, and she stays with me 2 weekends a month. I also pay child support. I go to her school events, holidays etc. But if i'm honest, i don't feel like i love her and i know that that makes me the AH. I care about her, but i don't miss her when she is not with me and i don't feel the need to see her.\n\n 6 years ago i met my wife, Anna, and it was love at first sight (side note : me and clara weren't in a relationship since sadie was born, so no cheating). Clara and sadie both disliked my wife, but that didn't stopped me and we got married. We now have 2 kids, 4M and 2F. With my younger kids it was completely different for me, i loved since the first moment i knew they existed and that love grows every day since they were born. \n\nSadie comes to our house 2 weekends a month, but she hates my wife and my toddlers. I don't allow her to speak badly to them, i told her she has the right to not have a relationship with them, but she has to respect them. My wife has no problem with sadie and never complained about her. My kids mostly ignore her, but they act like this with everyone who won't play with them, since at this age they don't have other interests.\n\nMy half sister, who is a friend of Clara, came to visit us and stayed with us for a few days. My HS doesn't like my wife because she wanted me to marry clara. We were nc for a few years, but my wife, who wants everyone to have a good relationship, convinced me to let her back into our lives.\n \nBefore leaving she got in a fight with me, saying that i coddle my 2yo way too much and how horrible i'm for not doing that for sadie too. It is true that my 2yo is a total daddy's girl and if i'm home she always follows me around and wants to be near me. She often asks for cuddles and hugs and i'm happy to give them to her. Same with my son, but my sister wasn't disturbed by me cuddling my son, just my daughter. She was always obssesed by daddy's girl figure, since she was never that with my dad (long story). \n\nShe said i'm an AH, because since sadie wasn't a daddy's girl,  my 2yo shouldn't be either. I told her that while i'm not a good father for sadie, even  if i'm and always was present in her life, it doesn't mean that i shouldn't love my youngest daughter. Am i the asshole for coddling my 2yo, even if i didn't do the same for my oldest??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Some even have scapegoats (and this is when it stops being ok-ish). Families are tricky. \n\nMy dad was in a similar situation with OP's: he didn't want me and separated with my mom.

If you didn't want a kid, you should have made sure your partner was on the same page before a pregnancy came into play. You did have a responsibility to try and bond with that child if you were going to remain in her life. Otherwise, if you weren't, you should have never gone for any visitation and just been a paycheck rather than putting up that farce.\n\nYou say you don't love your child, and I promise you she knows. You had a responsibility to at least make an attempt if you were going to be in her life, however. Honestly, if you aren't, visitations should be up to her at this point because she may not want to visit anymore than you want her to. I don't think it's healthy for her to see you making more of an effort with the younger kids but not any with her. At least foot the bill for her therapy for this", "YTA. Imagine how Sadie feels.

That's f*cked. \n\nOP should do therapy to learn how to do all that he can do to repair his behavior/relationship with Sadie, but none of that should be at the expense of the younger children. Fairness isn't equitable, and equitable is actually what is moral, short of justice. \n\nIt's so f*cked that the Aunt wants the littles to suffer just to keep things fair, like fairness is some justification for depravity. The aunt is completely repugnant and I wouldn't want her around any of my kids.", "NTA as much as people I comments would love that way. There is not much you can do about your emotions. \nMy sister gave birth to a baby few years ago and she simply cannot bring herself to love said baby.

You never bonded with her, possibly because you didn't want her, or felt trapped by her mother.\n\nThat said it is less that you're an asshole and more that it's just a sad situation for the kid. \n\nYou told your oldest it's ok not to like your new family but to respect them, probably the best way to handle the situation. You acknowledge her feelings but layed out the rules.\n\nYou should probably offer to have your oldest go to therapy and you should try it too on your own.

Just bcz she says she's fine doesn't mean she's \"actually\" fine. Most probably she saw herself as a burden on your perfect and happy family and do not want to disturb it. Attending school meets, giving separate room, visiting museum does not equal to loving your child. It's just that you're giving them a distraction so that they can not flip on you in future It's as simple as that for me. Children are the best observers tho we feel like they're not. You're not attached to her emotionally as you're with your toddler just bcz she was born from a loveless affair that YOU and YOUR partner decided to have. What's her fault in ALL of this matter so that she's being punished with this emotionally distant relationship. And plz don't go around throwing shit like, \"oh i pay for child support\", \"i visit her school\", \"she has her own room here\" because that's the least you can do after y'all selfishly decided to just have some fun resulting in her life being a mess!!\n\nI was going through your previous responses on other subs and i saw a pattern of yours to defend only the \"immediate\" family members not the attached plus ones.

That takes some dedication, particularly given that he didn't want to have a baby so young. But despite this he did maintain connection. Its natural that he's closer to his younger children who were born when he was more ready and have lived with him since birth. It's hard for his eldest daughter, and certainly not her fault, and it's hard on him. But I don't think he's an arsehole.", "YTA - but this does make me think about the reality of women having the sole decision about carrying a pregnancy to term.

I wish more women would think about the resentment this creates and be less selfish about having children in the wrong situation.", "Unpopular  NTA ... You are allowed your feelings; you're allowed to feel underlining resent towards being forced into fatherhood years ago. You do your visits, see her games, pay support etc etc etc.... That does not mean you have to cuddle/ coddle her. It is ok to have different relationships with different kids; so long as said relationship isn't blatantly disrespectful and remains impartial. It's not like you're showing blatant favoritism. As well your kids are toddlers; toddlers require a far different level of interaction.", "I will go against the grain here and say NTA specifically WRT the situation with your half sister.\n\nOP, you did not want Sadie as a young man. That is understandable even if it is uncomfortable. You were 20 years old and did not want to be a father. Clara decided that she would like to make your, hers, and Sadie's lives materially worse and more difficult by choosing to keep her. \n\nNevertheless, you have risen to the occasion. You remain active in Sadie's life. You financially support her. You show up to major life events. You keep her in your home with your chosen family for two weekends out of the month despite, again, you not having a strong bond with her or love for her. Most importantly, you are self-aware enough to realize that you feel differently about Sadie.\n\nI'm not terribly surprised that you have a closer bond to your younger children in comparison to Sadie. If this custody arrangement has been ongoing since she was a child, then it stands to reason that the parent with significantly less time with Sadie would have less of a relationship with her.\n\nIf your half sister is complaining about your unequal treatment of your 2Y in comparison to Sadie but not your 4Y who you treat very similarly, I would be inclined to think that her complaint isn't truly about your treatment of Sadie, as you implied. It's also an odd complaint; how exactly are you meant to be treating a 13Y and a 2Y in the same way?\n\n\nHere's where you are the AH and you know it: Sadie is suffering in this current arrangement. It sounds like you broke up with Clara because she wanted to keep Sadie and you didn't. While her mom is responsible for making your lives worse, you are also responsible for not taking accountability for your bad decisions and being a better father to Sadie and better partner to Clara. You have also made your lives worse.\n\nSadie has had to live for over a decade with the implicit knowledge of the fact that her dad didn't want her. She has now had to spend half her life with the knowledge that her dad chose a woman different from her mom. And she has now observed you be, by your account, an affectionate and loving father to her half siblings.\n\nI can't speak to your daughter's emotional state, but the rejection I would feel if one of my parents chose a different family over me would be overwhelming.\n\nIf you truly wish to be a good father to Sadie, which it appears you do, then you need to do everything in your power to salvage the relationship or give her the agency to choose whether she wants to remain in the relationship. \n\nSadie's needs take precedent over yours. If your daughter objected to you getting married to your wife and you got married anyway, she has once again observed you value your wants and needs above her own. You haven't prioritized her needs. That is your right, but you have created a situation in which your daughter's emotional and familial needs have been sidelined in favor of yours.\n\nThere is not much to be done at this point. You have already made a series of decisions that cannot be taken back. At this point, the best you may be able to do is to acknowledge the situation to Sadie and apologize. You may be able to salvage a relationship with her.", "I don't feel he's the AH in the current situation, but I've been similar to where Sadie is in treatment/love though living arrangements were different.  \n\n\nTherapy is a good idea.  \n\n\nHe may or may not ever feel that parental love for Sadie, but therapy could possibly work or at least create a better dynamic... especially if maybe at some point they do therapy together, too.", "But is it possible for therapy to make you start loving someone you don't love?", "N t a for growing as a person and a parent.

A huge part of being a good parent has nothing to do with how \u201cloving\u201d or \u201cmotherly\u201d or \u201cfatherly\u201d you feel. It\u2019s about meeting the needs of the child and not letting them see when you don\u2019t feel those sorts of ways.

Even still, you sounds like you are being incredibly attentive towards her and prioritizing her whenever she is at your home. \n\nI honestly wonder what Sadie even feels about all this. Does she even feel like she\u2019s being slighted due to the situation? Not every girl is a daddy\u2019s girl even when they have a present and loving father.

I suppose that was his right, but it's also my right to not give a shit about him either.", "That's what makes him TA. He has done nothing to work on whatever has blocked him from loving her.

My father took his own life when I was just 5 months old after my mum left him. 25 years later I still question if he really loved me (he was the one that wanted me) and why he didn't fight for me.\n\nJust to add, I've had a LOT of therapy over the years addressing various issues including my father. I still have abandonment issues because of what he did that I don't think I'll ever really be over. I have the most amazing stepdad who's been in my life for coming up on 16 years and I love him to pieces, but I'll always have those questions around my father", "Absolutely, but I think Sadie's mom has a small bit of responsibility here. You can't move forward with a pregnancy when it's clear the father doesn't want to have a kid with you and expect them to be dad of the year. It seems like it was obvious that OP would be a sh*t dad to Sadie from day one. He's different with his younger kids because he was in love with thier mother and wanted them. He obviously thinks Sadie was a mistake. \n\nI guess if someone forced me to become a parent when I really didn't want to I'm not sure how great of a mom I'd be.

You know what he/we did?\n\nFaced that anger head on. Not in a combative way. But in a way where he felt heard and seen. My husband made a huge effort to hug him more. Tell him he is proud of him more. Tell him how much he loves him more. I made sure to show the same. Correction comes with reassuring him that even though we're correcting his actions, he is still a very loved kid and a part of this family that we arent ever letting go of. It was a rough few years, but now he knows he's loved and he's enjoying his dad growing up and being a better dad too. But it takes so much time and effort to grow that love. You can do it. But it starts with changing the narrative in your own head about your first baby. Go to therapy. Any time you think something negative about her, tell her/call her/text her something you love about her. Rewire your brain to quit saying \"I didn't want her. I was too young. It wasn't my choice\" to \"She is a part of me. She is wonderful. She is smart. She is the best part of me. She is my baby girl\".

If you don't love a child they are actually pretty damn perceptive and will pick up on it subconsciously. Also from your comments justifying and rejustifying it seems like you aren't interested in changing if you are deemed the AH. \n\nYour sis is also a bit of an AH....because she could have sat down and talked to you like an adult instead of going off on one and bringing your 2 year old into it. \n\nUnsolicited advice but if you read and are interested, take it. If not, fair enough...\n\n1. Get yourself into therapy to find out what's going on with you. It could be that the whole circumstances of her birth as unexpected could harbour resentment towards her as a person. Whatever the reason this is pretty much an imperative. \n2. She's 13, bet she has a pretty well formed personality, do you get on with her and like her? You should be making more of an effort to get to know her as a person, even if you're spending time, if you aren't engaged or you're largely silent you may as well be apart or be her taxi driver. \n3. Coddling your 2 year old is probably not a wise thing to do anyway as she also has an older sibling. Treat your kids as equally as you can. Not saying no cuddles or anything but there's a difference between one child knowing they can get all of your attention by doing x and kids who know how to take turns etc. kids thrive on healthy boundaries and your family will be happier if the boundaries (allowing for age-appropriate edits) apply equally.\n4. You don't expect her to have a relationship with the younger two.....that seems.......a bit like a brush off. There's a world of difference between her being treated like she has to play with them and (from your description) her barely interacting with them. You have a very fragmented unit and where you might think you're sparing her have you actually asked her how much she wants to be involved, would she like to be invited to other family stuff. Have her feelings about her stepmother changed at all. \n5. This has been alluded to above but defo deserves its own point. Communication. Yours could use some work. Sadie isn't wholly a child but nor is she an adult, this age you need to be engaging them more in the pre-adult space to give them a go at solving problems and figuring out who they are, so talk to her first, assure her that she can speak honestly and you won't be angry with her (and dont get angry with her.)\nCommunicate with your wife, what does she think? (But do not take as the only opinion). \nTalk to sis calmly and see what she thinks having the perspective of Clara and a perhaps a different side of Sadie. \nThe next person is Clara but depends entirely on the relationship thus far and whether this would be a harm or help situation. Sometimes it can help to give an insight into differences in Sadie between that home and this. \nOnce you've gotten all your info you need to sort through it and decide what is best to go forward. \n\nAs parents we often f*ck up......this is human. When we realise it is our duty as the adults and the parents to do our best to solve the f*ck up.....you have f*cked up, you are no longer ignorant and now you have to put in some emotional work with your daughter that is way overdue.

I have never been so conflicted over a post. As a woman, I think you need to consider the very real possibility that Clara or your half sister tried to baby trap you.

Sadie needs you so much more than you realize and you need very real help for the damage that has been done to you as well. Most of all, you need to have a very serious talk with your daughter when you have gotten a therapist and unpack what you\u2019ve done because of the situation.

Go do awesome things today!", "I'm sending you virtual hugs. As a mom it's hard for me to process bc I love and adore my children. I'm 44 and have a very strained relationship with my mom\ud83d\ude29", "Do you have to be a Mom to send Mom Love, or is it OK to just be old enough to be one?  Cause I never had kids, but I am pretty old.  <3", "Another old mum here sending you love and hugs \ud83e\udd17", "Here's a hug as well. It does get better, life i mean. Put yourself first . the first crawl is the hardest, but you get up and running. Stay stromg and remember, You matter!  \ud83d\udc97", "I agree 100%\n\nThe circumstances were completely different.", "Just another internet mom with a random internet hug for you, too!", "Exactly! OP is doing Sadie more harm than good by having her \"stay\" with them two weekends a month. \n\n That poor sweet girl. My heart hurts for her.", "He probably wrote this to continue being an asshole to his oldest daughter. There\u2019s no way SIL complained he\u2019s too nice to a 2 year old.", "exactly. it would have been so much less damaging for sadie if he hadn\u2019t been forced to be a father to her before he was ready. i spent my whole childhood wishing my mom would leave already, it took her until i was 29 to admit she never really wanted me. i was like bro I COULD TELL. it would have been so much better for me if she\u2019d have fucked off instead of teased me with the idea of having a mother.", "Ok, I have whats probably a very divisive opinion on this....did OP want Clara to have an abortion? Did Clara refuse? I honestly think that women should have complete autonomy over their own bodies...but I also believe that if the man didn't want a child and the woman is adamant about keeping it, that the man should be able to leave and have nothing to do with that child, physically or financially. A woman has a right to choose, so should a man. And for all the \" then he should have used protection\" people, it's never 100% reliable. I'll probably get down voted to hell, but it's my opinion \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Well he never wanted the child", "Anna should stay out of it but to suggest she does it to feel like someone\u2019s savior is unfair to her. Maybe it\u2019s because her childhood maybe it\u2019s because she wants her children to be involved with his family, you don\u2019t know and just because she is the second wife and step mother does not mean she is doing something for a silly reason", ">because he's almost certainly spinning it.\n\nYikes! If this is him spinning the story, I'd hate to see what the full, unbiased version would be like.", " I don't expect him to force emotions he doesn't have, but just leave her the fuck alone then. He doesn't wanna spend time with her, doesn't love her, doesn't miss her when she's gone so what's the point in even having a relationship? So he can \"step up to the plate\" and set her up to feel like shit because he wants nothing to do with her? \"Hey, great job dad, I see how you treat me vs. your other 2 kids. So it's not that you're incapable of feeling these emotions, you just don't feel them for me. Thanks so much for showing me that my whole life! Super glad you stepped up for me!\"", "I\u2019m so sorry. I would have been happy never seeing my father again should my parents have divorced and I can\u2019t imagine having to go visit him on visitation.  I\u2019m so sorry yours didn\u2019t protect you", "Totally this. Sadie would be better being full time with someone who loves her than with her dad who sees her as a second or maybe third option. She deserves better. I don't know how OP even managed to get some time with her despite showing almost zero interest.", "Beautiful \ud83d\ude0d", "how do you know when you\u2019re an old mom?", "OP is, horrid. He knows he's doing it, he knows he's the AH, he just doesn't care.", "Notice he says \u201cmy kids don\u2019t have a problem with Sadie\u201d he doesn\u2019t consider Sadie his kid", "You\u2019re 100% right. I agree completely. YTA OP. Your daughter is not an inconvenience, she is a person. She\u2019s especially at an age where her mental health can and probably is being horribly impacted by this. She matters whether you see it or not.", "Prediction: OP will delete his post - if not his entire account - within the next twelve hours.", "As someone from a large family, but being the \"unwanted\" one (my mother miscarried before I was born, my father could never stand me), children know these kind of things!\n\nHe will never admit it, but I know my father never wanted me. He hated me when I was a child, he couldn't stand me and I knew it. After the divorce my mother and I spoke about it a lot, it was one of the reasons they separated in the first place (yay more burdens on me...)\n\nHe knew it too and he tried his hardest to form a bond with me. Taking me to work with him and having special meals just the two of us and such. Not for lack of trying! I love him for trying so hard, but we both know there's something wrong, always has been and always will be. Kids know. They just know, even when you think they don't, when you think they are too young to understand. We had a literal fight when I was in my teens over him feeling inadequate to buy stuff for so many kids and me just wanting my dad, too young to be able to explain that to him. He never had similar fights with any of my many siblings. He never got it and never will, because simply he didn't want me even if he doesn't realise it. He wants to want me but he can't.\n\nI am almost 40 years old now and made my peace long ago, so did he. I fought with my father and we made up many times. We get along now and even found some common ground in music we both love. We have both accepted the situation I guess\n\nLong story short, kids know. I knew my dad didn't want me when I was 2, maybe 3 years old, let alone 13. And my dad at least tried his butt off to make sure I never felt unwanted", "Who ever would have thought that commenters in a forum designed for passing judgment might be judgmental? \ud83e\udd14 /s\n\nI agree with you, though. At least OP isn\u2019t making excuses for himself, has considered therapy, and is making some effort to be there. I think it\u2019s ESH with half-sister being the true AH.\n\nMy heart breaks for Sadie, though. Poor kid. People need to be better with contraception."]}
