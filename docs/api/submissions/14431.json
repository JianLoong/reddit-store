When i (34M) was 20, i had a relationship with a girl, let's call her Clara. When she got pregnant, i honestly wasn't happy, but since she was decided to keep the baby there wasn't anything i could do. When our daughter, let's say Sadie (13F) was born, i legally recognized her. We have shared custody, and she stays with me 2 weekends a month. I also pay child support. I go to her school events, holidays etc. But if i'm honest, i don't feel like i love her and i know that that makes me the AH. I care about her, but i don't miss her when she is not with me and i don't feel the need to see her.\n\n 6 years ago i met my wife, Anna, and it was love at first sight (side note : me and clara weren't in a relationship since sadie was born, so no cheating). Clara and sadie both disliked my wife, but that didn't stopped me and we got married. We now have 2 kids, 4M and 2F. With my younger kids it was completely different for me, i loved since the first moment i knew they existed and that love grows every day since they were born. \n\nSadie comes to our house 2 weekends a month, but she hates my wife and my toddlers. I don't allow her to speak badly to them, i told her she has the right to not have a relationship with them, but she has to respect them. My wife has no problem with sadie and never complained about her. My kids mostly ignore her, but they act like this with everyone who won't play with them, since at this age they don't have other interests.\n\nMy half sister, who is a friend of Clara, came to visit us and stayed with us for a few days. My HS doesn't like my wife because she wanted me to marry clara. We were nc for a few years, but my wife, who wants everyone to have a good relationship, convinced me to let her back into our lives.\n \nBefore leaving she got in a fight with me, saying that i coddle my 2yo way too much and how horrible i'm for not doing that for sadie too. It is true that my 2yo is a total daddy's girl and if i'm home she always follows me around and wants to be near me. She often asks for cuddles and hugs and i'm happy to give them to her. Same with my son, but my sister wasn't disturbed by me cuddling my son, just my daughter. She was always obssesed by daddy's girl figure, since she was never that with my dad (long story). \n\nShe said i'm an AH, because since sadie wasn't a daddy's girl,  my 2yo shouldn't be either. I told her that while i'm not a good father for sadie, even  if i'm and always was present in her life, it doesn't mean that i shouldn't love my youngest daughter. Am i the asshole for coddling my 2yo, even if i didn't do the same for my oldest??", "created_utc": 1681108456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h9pa9/aita_for_coddling_my_2yo_when_i_didnt_do_the_same/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I see that as being the real issue. You say you have been feeling the difference, so do something about it so you can be more of a dad than a father.  For me this is where you are the AH. The other stuff is just noise.", "Yta and you know it. No one cares about you cuddling your second daughter. Everyone cares about the trashy way you treat your oldest IN COMPARISON. Be a better man. Ugh.\n\nBtw, as a second daughter who WAS the loved one - I saw the disparity in how my dad treated me versus my half sister. And I no longer speak to him. So he lost his chance with both daughters to have a \"daddy's girl\".", "My take on this situation is that for 9 years (before you had your first loved child), Sadie assumed your lack of affection and only doing what you were supposed to do as a parent to avoid being called a deadbeat dad, was just how you are as a parent.  Then you have a son and Sadie realizes that you are capable of being a loving father,  just not to her. She is an afterthought and an obligation to you, not a loved child.  Her existence isn't her fault but you certainly blame her for it. \n\nYou say yourself that you don't love her. Why are you torturing her by forcing her to see you play \"happy families\" with the kids you wanted by continuing to have shared custody? YTA", ">But if i'm honest, i don't feel like i love her (...) I care about her, but i don't miss her when she is not with me and i don't feel the need to see her.\n\nSadie knows this. She feels it deep down in her heart even if she might not be able to put it into words. It is heartbreaking...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Sadie comes to our house 2 weekends a month, but she hates my wife and my toddlers. \n\nHave you ever wondered why? Did it cross your mind it might have to do with the first quote above? They are competition for her dads attention when she already felt you did not love her. \n\nNo money, museum visits or other material things can make up for not feeling loved. From your responses I can gather you really do not get this. You keep mentioning all the good things you did and do for Sadie. Yes, it is wonderful you spend time with her at museums. It really is. BUT... she still knows you do not love her, not like you love your younger children. That is scarring her. So YTA. \n\nThe question is: Do you want to change this? Do you want to have the same relationship with Sadie you have with your younger children? Do you want to feel the same love for her? Do you want her to feel the same love from you? \n\nAsked differently: Imagine the love you feel for your younger two children is gone. Imagine what that would feel like for you, knowing what you are missing. Imagine what that would feel like for them, them knowing what they are missing. Really feel this. And then realize this is what Sadie feels deep down, even if she cannot put it into words. \n\nI hope you do want to change this. Love is a verb. It needs work and if you want this type of love to develop between you and Sadie, you'll have to work on it. You might also want to seek professionel help to help you do this.", "You come here saying you don't feel love for your oldest child, and expect anything other than YTA as a judgment? Do you think she can't tell? She can. I feel terrible for her.", "YTA.\nYou\u2019re aware that you\u2019re playing favourites and making excuses for it.\nWhat do you do during your daughter\u2019s visits to attempt to foster a relationship with her?

I can\u2019t imagine that she\u2019s willfully visiting given that she doesn\u2019t like your wife and kids (who could blame her, you showed her who was more important).\n\nBecause if she doesn\u2019t want to be there you are *KNOWINGLY* and *WILLFULLY* subjecting her to this cruel torment of watching you *love your other children* when she knows you don\u2019t feel the same for her, because honestly, with this setup how could she fucking not?\n\nI rarely ever do this, but you should be ashamed of yourself, this is truly appalling.", "Yes, YTA for giving unequal treatment among your children. In my eyes, I see that Sadie is inconvenient for you and meddles with your \u201cperfect\u201d family. \n\nShe didn\u2019t ask to be born and she clearly feels your cold nature towards her. The pain to feel rejected by her own father will damage her for life. You may be there monetarily or in body, but you aren\u2019t giving her love, something that cannot be bought. Do better and be more fair.", "YTA. Your daughter knows you don't love her as much, and it can mess with her emotions and her self worth for the rest of her life. And by your comments it seems like you don't care. Do you care that you do not love your daughter? Do you even think that is should be different?\n\nYou need to change. You need to get into therapy. You have time to fix this, but hurry up.", "Jesus this sub is so full of jerks tonight that I'm starting to miss the fake posts from the trolls. \n\nYta. Easy peasy yta", "This is just a really sad post. She has a father who doesn't love her but dotes on his other children and a stepmother who has \"no problem\" with her.

If I'm you older daughter, you're dead to me.\n\nGeeez.", "YTA - You\u2019re a horrible father. Reading your words scream childish and incompetent. The way you treat your oldest child is disgusting. Hopefully they realize dad is a jerk and they don\u2019t deserve his actions.", "YTA, obviously. You have three children, but you only love two of them. Poor Sadie", "YTA for how you treated/treat Sadie, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be a good father for your younger daughter. With her, you are doing great and the real problem is that you didn't give Sadie the same treatment.\n\nYou can't change the past, but you can't punish your youngest for your own mistakes. I suspect the difference between Sadie and your \"daddy's girl\" will get bigger and bigger in the future. Could you try to fix this? Maybe connect with Sadie without your new family, trying to know her as a young soon to be woman, and not an annoying, unwanted child? I don't know if this is possible, but a real question is: do you want to save a relationship wit Sadie or is it convenient for you when she's becoming distant and cold?", "So\u2026 you admit you\u2019re a deadbeat dad and you\u2019re still wondering if you\u2019re the asshole? \n\nI hope Sadie can heal from the emotional trauma of having a father who clearly didn\u2019t want her, likes to remind her of that every chance he gets and doesn\u2019t want her in his life. Yeah, fucking YTA.", "You're beyond asshole.", "YTA. I feel so so so sorry for Sadie. The lifetime of trauma/poor self-esteem you\u2019re inflicting on that girl daily will never be reversed. Can\u2019t you just fake it? Or go to a therapist or something to figure out why you resent her for the choices your horny 20 year old self made? You honestly don\u2019t even understand people\u2019s perspectives. And you write things like \u2018my wife doesn\u2019t complain\u2019 as if that will ever be a good statement to make.

As an emotionally detached parent, you probably don't know that little children are highly perceptive, so she grew up with this... emptiness.\n\n\nYou're NTA for coddling your toddler, but YTA for not even seeking a meaningful connection with your oldest. She's going to grow up with daddy issues because of how you blindly reject her. She already knows you rejected her mother, she's been feeling rejected and unwanted her whole life, and now that she's a teen those feelings, due to your coldness, are going to blossom into something so ugly and sad...\n\n\nYou have to at least try, do some counselling together.", "Wow you\u2019re cruel. \n\nTossing that little girl scraps of required parental presence whilst giving your other children all your love. That\u2019s cold af. \n\n\nYTA and your daughter deserves better", "YTA and stop denying it. Just read your own post. Yes you do things with her, but your emotionally unavailable to her. You say it yourself. Paying child support doesn't make you less of a deadbeat for that alone. You don't have a relationship with that child you have and obligation you fulfill and there is no way in the world she hasn't caught on yet or will in the near future. Fix this now or leave her alone.", "Do you want a better relationship with Sadie?\nDo you actually enjoy spending time with her or literally just do it because of guilt \n\nI would find a therapist and talk through what your feelling", "I\u2019m just hoping that Sadie isn\u2019t on social media and I\u2019m praying that if she is she doesn\u2019t see this, she knows your a terrible father and for you to say you don\u2019t love her is just beyond me especially when you claim to be a good father! It would probably be best to cut all contact given that it\u2019s just hurting her more seeing you live your other kids and treat her as if she is nothing more that an inconvenience to you", "Once a child is born, how you feel towards her mother is irrelevant. Whether or not you fall 'head over heels' for another is irrelevant. Whether you wanted a child or not becomes irrelevant. She's a part of you, she's a result of your decision to have sex and she needs a father. The end. As an adult, you work on your feelings...you recognise which parts of your perception and behaviour aren't conducive to a strong father-daughter relationship and you fix it. \n\nCoddling your two year old isn't the issue - your current  family isn't the issue. You are the issue.\n\nYou can go on to have another 50 kids if you wanted to...but Sadie will only ever get one father. You're it. And she gets someone who doesn't love her, doesn't miss her...but fulfills legal obligations.. She doesn't get any do-overs where she can procure a better father.\n\nI'm sure you know exactly why she's jealous and can't forge a relationship with kids who get your love freely and abundantly.

That poor girl deserved better than you for a father.", "YTA you should have just stayed out of Sadie's life and given her mum more money. How awful for Sadie to realise you can love, just not her.\n\nAs your wife I would be disgusted to see how you treat your eldest child and honestly would have questioned whether I wanted anything to do with you, clearly not a huge problem for your wife because she and her children are getting the best of you.\n\nDon't be surprised when she's NC with you, but you really wouldn't care would you.", "YTA. YTA. YTA. Sadie doesn't deserve such treatment. I don't blame her for hating your wife and toddlers.  She doesn't deserve to be treated as the obligation.

It's a BABY. That's basically their major need at that age.\n2. Poor Sadie. She deserves better from you. You're the only father she has. She's not stupid. She can see the favoritism plain as day. Frankly, she deserves better in general.\n3. I've got a dad who actually was absent most of my life. Had me young just like you did, and then a few years later started his REAL family. When I finally met him he told me straight up that he wasn't a good father. And I thought at the time that it meant he would try harder. What it really meant is that he saw no reason to try at all as he saw bad as something he was. These wounds manifest differently in each of our lives, but they show up sure enough. In fact, your oldest girl is at about the same age I was when I started cutting myself, and ripping out my hair, starving myself, and forcing myself to vomit all the time. Anything to be perfect and to contain my hurt and rage from rejection.  If you don't want to be spending your visitation days inside a mental hospital, I'd start thinking long and hard about how the two of you can start bonding more and having a REAL relationship. Time goes fast, you won't get these years back. You won't have this chance again.\n\nJust my 2 cents though.", "To be honest, I don't really know what judgement to go with. My dad sounds a lot like you. He had 3 daughter from his first marriage, all much older than I am. He was there for them, but he worked long hours, and only spent time with them on holiday etc. He isn't cold towards them, but he wasn't really present in their lives as much. \n\nThen he married my mom, retired early, and had me. He became a stay at home dad, and honestly, I was spoiled as hell. A lot of stuff has happened since then. \n\nThe animosity between by my half-sisters and I has grown to such an extent, that I have had to go NC with all of them. \n\nI sympathise with Sadie because I can only imagine the pain she must be feeling by having an absent and unreachable dad. \n\nI will go YTA, simply because you could have done better. You HAVE TO do better.", "Everyone coming down on OP like he\u2019s a deadbeat. Does anyone know what a deadbeat parent is like?? OP is at least trying. He makes a point to spend one on one time with his oldest doing things she enjoys (which her own mom won\u2019t take her to do; museums), shows up to her important events and they spend holidays together. Quality time is huge. \n\nI think he had a rough go in the beginning with her. He was put into a parental roll before he was ready, but he didn\u2019t abandon her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect he might have different feelings in that situation vs having kids when he was ready with a woman he loves. It\u2019s not the same. It doesn\u2019t make the relationship with his daughter doomed. \n\nJust because it will take more work to love the same doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen. I know therapy gets thrown around left and right here but I think it would be beneficial. To work out these feelings and figure out how to grow and nurture love for the oldest. Being there for her is great, but really get to KNOW her as a person. Try to have meaningful conversations, ask questions and find common ground. \n\nNo judgement here, it\u2019s past my pay grade but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily an AH if you are truly willing to take the effort to know and learn to love her.

Your young children are obviously babies and blameless and in no way should you be less of a parent to them to try and \u201cmatch\u201d the parenting level or emotions you have towards Sadie, and it sounds like your wife is emotionally aware and trying to do her best to support everyone.", "Just like my dad. He was never there but he supported me. It is just how it is. He has 3 more kids with the other women and after my mom passed away he started to tell me about them. I don\u2019t hate them or dislike them. I did feel a bit sad when he shows me how great of a time they had/ vacation they take. But you know, life goes on. If I kept focusing on what I didn\u2019t have with my dad, it still wont help out relationship.

You won\u2019t make things better for Sadie by not affectionate to the younger ones.  Your half-sister is not being reasonable.\n\nThat being said, I think you realize, and are right to feel bad about, not loving Sadie in the same way you love the younger two. You can\u2019t change the past, but maybe you can work at getting to know your oldest child better and developing more of a relationship with her. What can you do to make her feel that you value and cherish her?  Are there things you can do together that don\u2019t involve your wife or the younger kids? Is there an interest you share or an interest of hers you might get into? At this point in her life she has less need of cuddling than in having you show interest and approval.  \n\nThere are many different types of love, and what children need from us changes as they grow.. Even in families where the parents stay together and love each other, the elder kid(s) don\u2019t have the same relation with the parents as the younger ones because the parents change as they get older. Your relationship with your older child is not doomed. You may find that as you learn to relate to her as a teenager you find love for her inside you that you hadn\u2019t recognized before. \n\nKeep loving and cuddling your little ones, but try to give more of yourself to the older child when she is around.", "ESH (except the children and your wife) ok i will go straight to the point\n\n1.

When i (34M) was 20, i had a relationship with a girl, let's call her Clara. When she got pregnant, i honestly wasn't happy, but since she was decided to keep the baby there wasn't anything i could do. When our daughter, let's say Sadie (13F) was born, i legally recognized her. We have shared custody, and she stays with me 2 weekends a month. I also pay child support. I go to her school events, holidays etc. But if i'm honest, i don't feel like i love her and i know that that makes me the AH. I care about her, but i don't miss her when she is not with me and i don't feel the need to see her.\n\n 6 years ago i met my wife, Anna, and it was love at first sight (side note : me and clara weren't in a relationship since sadie was born, so no cheating). Clara and sadie both disliked my wife, but that didn't stopped me and we got married. We now have 2 kids, 4M and 2F. With my younger kids it was completely different for me, i loved since the first moment i knew they existed and that love grows every day since they were born. \n\nSadie comes to our house 2 weekends a month, but she hates my wife and my toddlers. I don't allow her to speak badly to them, i told her she has the right to not have a relationship with them, but she has to respect them. My wife has no problem with sadie and never complained about her. My kids mostly ignore her, but they act like this with everyone who won't play with them, since at this age they don't have other interests.\n\nMy half sister, who is a friend of Clara, came to visit us and stayed with us for a few days. My HS doesn't like my wife because she wanted me to marry clara. We were nc for a few years, but my wife, who wants everyone to have a good relationship, convinced me to let her back into our lives.\n \nBefore leaving she got in a fight with me, saying that i coddle my 2yo way too much and how horrible i'm for not doing that for sadie too. It is true that my 2yo is a total daddy's girl and if i'm home she always follows me around and wants to be near me. She often asks for cuddles and hugs and i'm happy to give them to her. Same with my son, but my sister wasn't disturbed by me cuddling my son, just my daughter. She was always obssesed by daddy's girl figure, since she was never that with my dad (long story). \n\nShe said i'm an AH, because since sadie wasn't a daddy's girl,  my 2yo shouldn't be either. I told her that while i'm not a good father for sadie, even  if i'm and always was present in her life, it doesn't mean that i shouldn't love my youngest daughter. Am i the asshole for coddling my 2yo, even if i didn't do the same for my oldest??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You have tried to do your best, been affectionate and taken an interest in Sadie's interests. You have a whole day dedicated to her every week, speak on the phone when she's at her mom's, you never forced her to bond with your wife and other children (and even then, the age gap is huge and most older kids won't want to hang around with toddlers)... You don't seem to have rubbed it in Sadie's face giving your toddlers cuddles while she doesn't get them - and again, the age gap means they have different needs anyway.

Absolutely despicable.", "He freely says in the post and on multiple comments he loves his youngest children more and doesn\u2019t love or even miss Sadie when she\u2019s not around.", "You asked if you were the AH. A lot of people have answered. Now it\u2019s up to you to decide what to do with that information. To either improve your relationship with your daughter and help ease some of her trauma, or just continue as you are. YTA, will you continue to be one?", ">I admit that i love my youngest more,\n\nYeah this is what makes you an AH", "INFO: What\u2019s her life with her mother like? My heart is already breaking for her, but if she doesn\u2019t have her own room in her primary residence, is that because she\u2019s having to share with a half sibling and is basically being put on the back burner in favour of *\u2019the new family\u2019* by both her families?? \n\nI saw you\u2019re considering therapy. I\u2019d strongly advise you do that.", "I think you are trying, and that is good.  You might go further and ask questions about her dreams, how she feels about the world, etc.  You might look for ways in which she reminds you of yourself or you parents and tell her. Make sure you let her see when you are proud of her when she does well, and if/when it comes up, tell her that when she was born you were young and scared of being a father, but that you are glad she has turned out so well in spite of your not being the dad you would have liked to have been. \n\nYou can\u2019t force love, but you can nourish the seeds of love by communicating, sharing, and supporting.", "He hasn\u2019t improved. He doesn\u2019t even imply that he want wants his relationship with his oldest to improve. He seems content for things to carry on as they are.", "Except OP clearly has no interest in being a better parent to Sadie. He\u2019s mentally and emotionally written her off.", "He hasn\u2019t, though.", "If you honestly think that your child doesn't realize that you don't love her like her siblings, not only are you an AH, but you are a delusional AH too.", "You are so dismissive of her, and treat her like an afterthought. \n\n*My wife has no problem with sadie and never complained about her.* \n\nThis is such a cold and dismissive statement. Sadie was SEVEN when the stepmother came onto the scene, but you talk as if you have to apologise to your wife for the inconvenient intrusion. If she didn't want to have a stepdaughter, she shouldn't have married someone with a daughter. Don't act as if you and your wife are saints for \"never complaining\" about the existence of a child who has a right to be treated like family.", "If you don't think she notices the difference in quality of affection she gets from you vs your wanted children then you are a fool.", "Hopefully when she's older, she'll realize she's better off with someone who has to congratulate himself for grudgingly being \"present\" in her life. She deserves people who love her. Maybe if you'd taken the same time and effort to be a father to her as you did with your younger children, then you'd have the same bond. Don't act as if it's her failing. It's yours.", "\u201cI love my youngest more\u201d \n\nBeing present isn\u2019t enough, being enthusiastically present is. You\u2019re a loser.", "Oh, that makes it OK then ...\n\n(\\*sarcasm\\*)", "Clara isn't going to be single forever. Catholics aren't the only ones who walk down the aisle. Why are you in Sadie's life if you don't love her?", "Being intentionally dense and purposely missing the point is making you even more TA if that\u2019s even possible", "She would be better off without you, having no father is better than having one that doesn't love you. You are trash", "Tell your wife you don't love Sadie and watch how horrified she looks. You are disgusting.", "When someone's pissed off at you, especially a teenage girl, and you ask her if she's okay, of course she's gonna say I'm fine. She can't rely on you to open herself up so she's greyrocking...which is what I do with my narcissistic mother", "If Sadie is happy then everyone else can piss off. \n\nDon't sell yourself short...you are there, you know her and you see her and she is respected and cared for. The AH on here do a fraction of what you do and want a bloody medal. Each kid is getting what they need, even kids with the same parents born 10 plus years apart or 2 years apart have different experiences with them...and that is ok.\n\nDon't confuse the situation when she was born to now... you ahev grown and so has she. Let go of that time and celebrate the now...if you stop hating on yourself and relax, I think everyone will be happier. \n\nNTA", "She wasn't happy because you actually love those kids. You flat out said you dont love her in your post. Wtf is wrong with you.", "My father and I talk. Not daily but a few times a month. I live overseas so not that I can see him. You are trying to make yourself feels better but she probably can tell the difference of how diffidently you treated your kids. (Your sister could tell you treated the girls differently \ud83d\ude02) \n\nAgain, it\u2019s is what is it, hopefully Sadie let it go easy like I did \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yep it\u2019s confirmed you guys suck except your wife and the kids", "> You should never love one child more than the other.\n\nI know what you're trying to say here, but I don't think that is even possible. Like you'll love/be proud of/like one kid more when they achieve something like blurt their first words, graduation, etc. In milestones like these its hard not to love them more than the others \n\nBut what's shitty is loving one and not loving the other.", "Or emotionally", "He has improved as accepting what a parent is. Like it or not he wasn't feeling like a parent before. Was that unfair to his first daughter? Of course! But he learned that parenting is also love and play and connection. So your advice is since as a baby father he was a cold one he should also be cold to his other kids also ? His first is a bit old now, things will never mend 100% due to his mistakes.", ">Catholics aren't the only ones who walk down the aisle.\n\nThat could be, but in our religion the bride and groom enter the church with the wedding's godparents. The father of the bride has no role whatsoever in a wedding.", "In all honesty, when sadie is i focus more on her than the other kids.", "how is it that good people find ahs", "No, my advice is he should find a way to be a better parent to his first.", "If he\u2019s learned that, why is he still treating Sadie like Cinderella? She\u2019s still a child, he could be better to her as well.", "It's not about the religion. It's about how you know treat your oldest like crap and not caring. You flaunt the love you have for the two in front of the child you don't love. Then you expect her to accept it.", "Ok. Here\u2019s another scenario if you\u2019re going to be dense about this. \n\nMy Dad is a lot like you, although he\u2019s still married to my Mom. I knew growing up that he didn\u2019t love me as much as my sister and brother even though he was physically there for many things. \n\nWe\u2019re expecting our first child  in June but the hospital only allows three visitors because of ongoing Covid protocols. It was very easy to decide which grandparent was cut. \n\nBeing a Dad is more than just physically being there or providing financial support, as a parent you are their first experience with love. You failed miserably at that. I would encourage you seek therapy to improve your relationship with Sadie and begin loving her like a parent should."]}
