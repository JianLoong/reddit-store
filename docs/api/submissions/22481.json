He will always be looked at as one when he comes in especially since he stole multiple times. Actions have consequences and more people need to realize this!

You weren't out there with a sign of his face shouting to the world he was a shoplifter. He doesn't feel harassed. He feels guilty. Next time you see him I would let him know the store has no issue against him any longer as long he continues to pay he is welcome anytime.", "NTA. If he doesn't want to be branded a thief, maybe he shouldn't steal?", "I don't think you are. He has to live with the consequences of his past actions. Don't actually harass him, but it is your job to watch these things. He can either live with it or change locations.", "NTA. It\u2019s the consequences of his own actions that has people on edge around him. He should just be thankful that he\u2019s even allowed in the store", "nta. guy brought it on himself.", "NTA. \n\nHell, at least your manager agrees to keep an eye on him.  The guy is a thief. If you steal things you pay the consequence.

Honestly a miracle he still can shop there.", "NTA. Should've told him he's lucky a photo of his face isn't posted nice and big by the register", "He is a proven thief. NTA.", "NTA.

He needs to be banned.", "Yeah he did, we have a copy of his trespass warrant", "Ah, I read it as another customer overheard the conversation.   My bad.\n\nSo yeah, it's his business, but tough.

Every time I returned there for the rest of the game, he called me Thief as did everyone in that small town. This man has no business setting foot into that store, and even less for being called the spade he is.", "Why would someone come in after caught stealing?", "Gosh... It's just terrible how he gets treated. It's like he's a thief or something.\n\nOh.  Wait.  He was a thief.  Yes, he hasn't stolen recently, but... it's going to take time for him to be trusted.  Might take a long time. He is in no position to protest being treated like this. NTA.", "Honestly OP sounds wayyyyyyyyyyy too young to be working there.", "I have heard that as an explanation for shoplifting waves, security let alone ordinary employees don't want to risk a dangerous confrontation - to some extent that seems prudent, on the other hand soft by being overcautious."]}
