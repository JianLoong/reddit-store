If I tried sleeping early I would just end up rolling around and staring into the darkness for hours while not feeling rested at all. If I have some additional chores and stuff to wrap up, my best productive time's around 10pm.....you can imagine how well that all went.

I moved out right after high school and when I went job hunting later on, I found an office job with nine-to-five work hours and followed my own sleeping schedule.

I don't mean to beat you up over the fact, but he is caring for you and you are in his home.", "What don't you understand in \"I have a lease\", what's so complicated to understand? It was never about money and I'm confused about why you insist so much that it is.", "Through the Summer you live in his home and your lease does nothing for you. Living in his home you should respect his rules OR move out.", "Please don't use quiet quitting, that term is coined specifically to shame people who just want to do their job instead of living and breathing for the company. Back in the days that was called 'not going the extra mile', and not 'quiet quitting' xDDD", "I can't tell if you're actually being serious but regardless this is the last time I'll reply. Our conversation has been a waste of time because you're trying to pin the responsibility on me for the sole reason he declined I pay rent without taking all the context I gave into account.", "English is my second language so if \"quiet quitting\" is a term I shouldn't use, what would you suggest instead?

What a weird man.", "NTA\n\nPeople who work \"traditional days\" don't understand people who work alternative hours.", "NTA. Sounds like you've got an easy way to make your dad not do it again though, just tell your stepmom if he wakes you up that's how it's going to go down. She'll handle it for you.", "Nta", "Are you keeping your dad up at night when you\u2019re home? I can understand him wanting you quiet. Do you wake him up when you come home from work?\n\nI think if you\u2019re working minimum wage, relocate to somewhere else. I\u2019m confident you can find another minimum wage job elsewhere just fine.", "NTA. That is ridiculous. Sounds like he just likes having control over you.", "NTA", "Listen, it's all great that OP is 21 and feels like a big boy. \n\nBut the first thing he did after his wake up call was to tattle to grandma. \n\nYou wanna claim adult, actl ike an adult. \n\nMeanwhile the dad is just a controlling ass.

Cheap movies, late open-library, friend who doesn't sleep and would let you stay late, walmart, anything?", "If you've tried melatonin I want to mention that it's sold in doses way higher than you actually need and too much can really fuck your sleep up. 1mg doses of melatonin were perfect for me but I once accidentally ordered 10mg pills and it was awful.", "And don't forget that he hit the back of his head, that's not ok, I'm really surprised that no one is pointing this out", "If I was anywhere in North America, this is what I would do. However, I'm in France, where most places are not allowed to be open at night. At this time the only thing that'd be open (and not about to close) are bars and clubs. I'm also in a place where buses stop at 10PM and subways stop at 12:30AM. So during the day I can definitely go out, but past 9PM that's going to be an issue.\n\nAlso the only friend I have nearby (and he's still 50kms away) is a single dad of a 4-year-old so... Yeah I don't have this option", "Honestly most people wouldn\u2019t have that much of a problem with it.

Let me tell you something. Working late/extra doesnt really get you shit. What will actually happen is YOUR EMPLOYER WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU. It isnt fucking \"quitting\". Its just doing your job. He's not obligated to do a ton of extra labor. He isnt living for this job. Its just something he does to earn some money,its NOT a career. I doubt he is in college to have a career in catering lol.", "Daddy can u read me a bedtime story until I fall asleep \ud83d\udca4", "Go to bed at 3pm if you think OP should be asleep before their shift even ends", "Ok.

I know the walls are thin so I'm especially cautious.\n\nLight, minimal. As I said my door is closed and there's black clothing all around it to prevent any light from escaping.
