It sounds like ur either exaggerating ur fathers actions or leaving things out to make yourself sound not as bad. I could be wrong obviously but idk it just doesnt sit right. Ima say ESH tho cuz from what i read ur dad sounds like a toddler tryna bully you lmao and u sound kinda prissy", "NTA. My father tried to enforce a bedtime on me when I came back from college for the first break in the fall. It was love 10:30 and he kept trying to get me to go get ready lol I said I wasn't tired and pretended like I was oblivious until he gave up and went to bed. I stopped staying at their house", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult and handling your work schedule \n\nHis behavior is immature and abusive. I would not stay there further", "NTA, but you need to stay with a different relative. His rules are ridiculous, but it's his house. You won't win this fight.", "Look, I don't know if you are perhaps omitting something. But I dealt with my and my mother's completely different bio-rhythm as well as work/school hours growing up.\n\nShe is the type of morning person who would start falling asleep by 9pm the latest, doesn't matter if she watches a movie with almost max volume, however, she would wake up around 5am naturally instead. If she wants to do some chores, she would rather choose to do them 4am than in the evening.\n\nI am more of a night owl, my ideal bio-rhythmic sleep hours are 1-8 am now, while being a teen it was 2am-9am. If I tried sleeping early I would just end up rolling around and staring into the darkness for hours while not feeling rested at all. If I have some additional chores and stuff to wrap up, my best productive time's around 10pm.....you can imagine how well that all went. My mother not ever understanding I might really be so different from her made a point to wake me up at 6am the latest , when she went to work nevermind if my school started at 9am with 15min commute right? She would also make incredible noise if she was doing something at 4 am , not caring and saying \"Just wait you'll have to wake up for work anyways in a few years, better get used to it\"\n\nWell why I am telling you this story, Do you know what was my solution? I moved out right after high school and when I went job hunting later on, I found an office job with nine-to-five work hours and followed my own sleeping schedule. Because at the end of the day, if it's not your house/you're not paying rent, you always have to conform to the owner's lifestyle, that's the reality. So kinda ESH for your dad being absurd about this and for you complaining and tattle-telling to your grandma since you are an adult and should understand how this works by now.", "NTA. Your father needs to understand that you work on a different schedule than him.", "NTA.  Please don\u2019t spend more time there.  Info: is it possible to stay with your grandparents or other family/friends for the last month/month and a half?", "At this time, I'm usually just reading a book or scrolling social media, knowing full well that the walls are thin so any noise can wake them up. And if I have to listen to something I wear headphones. The only noise you can hear from my room is me turning pages when I read, his 10-month-old deaf kitten is louder even when she just walks", "I feel like if he could hear op he wouldn't need to get up to check on them, unless it was to tell them to be quiet, which isn't his complaint", "There are a lot of people who don't seem to understand that other people have different sleeping patterns because of different work schedules. It can be VERY hard for for those who work night shifts... but have partners or family who insist that sleeping past 7:00 is being lazy. I have no trouble believing OP's story is true and complete... because I have worked graveyard shifts, and have had neighbours and roommates who would not understand that I needed to be able to sleep in late.

Your dad sure is though.", "The commotion that woke your Stepmother up was caused by your father waking you at 6:30 am when you do not need to be up that early. The blame should be place on your father, not you.\n\nAs a waiter, you probably don't get home til midnight or later, and you sleep later than 6:30 am.\n\nFrom everything that I know about sleep, is that one should try to maintain the same schedule as that is what the body gets used to.  That is a reason why people who work where their shift changes every 7 days, can have sleep issues, and they usually get at least a day if not two off before their shift changes.\n\nYour father is wrong to insist when you go to bed on your night before your half day off.  You went to the trouble of preventing fifth from escaping your room.  \n\nCan you move out and live with another relative?\n\nNTA", "I love thay the spouse seems to sleep till 8:30, but how dare you, the child. NTA", "NTA. I dunno if I\u2019d call your dad abusive, one needs to know more about patterns of behaviour to make that call, but he\u2019s definitely TA and the one in the wrong this time.

This crap behavior you are dealing with is one of them. I know you're an adult - but you also aren't acting like one independently because you're expecting your family to put a roof over your head. I imagine, thought it's not been stated, you aren't paying rent either.   \n\n\nThe best way to resolve this is to move out on your own. If you can't figure out how to do that - put up with the crap for a bit longer until you can.   \n\n\nI know this isn't what you want to hear but as someone without a great relationship with their parents and who often worked 2nd or 3rd shift positions - it's always been an uphill battle in my own life. The only time I really felt good about it was when I moved out myself.  \n\n\nBest of luck to you as the situation just sucks.", "Unfortunately I'm stuck there, my closest relative is hundreds of kilometres away and I still need to go to work (they live in a small town and I'm not sure I can find another job, much less for such a short period of time)", "I usually finish my evening shift at midnight. Once I clock out I eat and get home, which is a 30 to 45 minutes walk (depends on how tired I am after my shift). Which means I rarely get home before 1AM. Expecting me to sleep at 11:30PM is unreasonable.\n\nOn top of that I have chronic insomnia, I've started having trouble sleeping when I was 7. I've tried everything and the only thing that works is THC, but since I still have effects the next day there's no way I can get some when I know I have to go to work. I'd rather go to work sleep deprived than half stoned.", "I should've precised that we call eachother twice a week, and we usually rant about our lives to eachother. Whenever she has something that annoys her she tells me and vice versa, I actually didn't expect her to take action", "Friends? NTA", "Then you should have specified i don't want you to talk to my Dad because thats going to totally undermine me as an adult which is the source if the problem in the first place.\n\nThe fact that she's planning on talking to him also kinda suggests that she sees you as a child as well.", "pfft nah, I just made a mental note not to be like that to my future kids, is all. I recommend that to OP as well  :) \n\nParenthood can be tough to navigate, but I have very good examples of what's not good :D", "The only one I know with a minimum of stability is a single dad with a 4-year-old son and their flat is already barely big enough for the both of them. The rest of them are college students with similar situations than mine", "It's totally fine to enlist help dealing with an abusive person. Grow up.", "People you know in the place who could have a spare room you could pay small rent on?", "Are you also 12? Waking someone up early is not abusive and you must live a very sheltered life if you think it is.", "Hitting someone in the head is abusive.", "Someone didn\u2019t read the whole post.", "So is throwing things at people so I guess OP is abusive as well. He's also taking advantage of his parent since he's a fully grown man earning money yet not contributing rent etc if you're going to look at it that way .\n\nYes hitting someone is abusive but the way this reads isn't a full blow to the head it sounds like a swat rather than something that was intended to actually hurt or cause damage.", "Yes I did, if it was a full on hit I feel like OP would have elaborated on it. I don't think its clear at all that this is an abusive relationship and it sounds as though it was a swat with no intention to hurt or cause harm and more of a don't throw things at me. \n\n Maybe I'm wrong so OP INFO: Was this a full blown hit or a swat? Is your father abusive?", "He threw a tshirt to get him out of the room because he was naked and the dad's response was to hit him. If you think that's cool, then I honestly don't know what to say.", "So what exactly do you expect me to do, be homeless for the summer? I eat and shower at work, I pay for my own meals during my day offs, I only go to his place to get some rest. I'm only staying there 'cause my lease specifies I can't stay in July/August, AND he's the one who asked if I wanted to come to his place this year. I asked if he wanted me to pay rent (he owns the house he lives in) and he declined.\n\nAlso I want to clarify again that 1 I was still half asleep when I threw my T-shirt and 2 it's common sense that recieving a cotton T-shirt in the torso won't harm anyone.", "I hate finding out people really think it\u2019s okay to hit other people for no reason.", "While I definitely felt the hit, it was far from what he made me go through when I was younger (Also because he knows I won't hesitate to press charges if he tries anything). He was abusive when I was a kid/in my early teens, but before this incident he didn't lay a single finger on me once he met my stepmother. We went through years of therapy and he apologized for everything he did to me when I was 16.", "I don't actually think you throwing a t-shirt was abuse I was being sarcastic, from your post I didn't think it sounded like what you described as a hit was likely to be abuse. If he's beating you then obviously he's the asshole in this situation. \n\nWhen I was at uni I worked and payed for my own place to stay over the summer. If I didn't I'd have stayed with friends. Of I was being abused I'd have gone and stayed with a different family member. If you're being abused why can't you go and stay with your grandma who you seem to be on good terms with?\n\n And if you're being abused I wouldn't advise getting someone to confront your abuser over the phone without you having somewhere safe to go because they'll likely just take it out on you. Your grandma can't keep you safe over a phone line.", "Thats sad for you then. \n\nAgain, I didnt read it to be a violent hit. I feel like if it was OP would probably be putting up a post about escaping an abusive household rather than being woken up early. People on reddit are so dramatic. \n\nI've simply given OP advice that his father clearly views him as a child and going to his nan and getting her to fix his problem is not going to solve that and so it will go from the time he goes to bed to another problem with the same root cause. Ops dad needs to view him as an adult and so OP needs to have a discussion with his dad about his behaviour. Both the waking him up and the hitting.", "My grandma lives on the other side of the country in a small town on an island, if I go live with her I'd need to quit my job and it's highly unlikely that I can find another job, especially for such a short period of time.\n\nAlso I don't have a car nor a driver's license (both are very uncommon at my age in my country unless your parents paid for both or you're in the military) so it'd take me 5 hours with a bullet train (9-10 hours with regular trains) and \u20ac150-ish to go to her place", "\\>I don't actually think you throwing a t-shirt was abuse I was being sarcastic  \nSchr\u00f6dinger's asshole", "You\u2019re correct, it is quite sad to see people fine with parents hitting their kids."]}
