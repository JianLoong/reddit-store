Yes, the comment was racist, but I don't think you should dump your girlfriend over this yet. Your relationship is salvageable. \n\nWhen I was young, I had a black girlfriend. At the beginning, it was a bit awkward because I had very few interactions with black people growing up in a white suburb and I was quite self conscious about being in a interracial relationship. I made a lot of awkward comments, including some racist jokes that I thought were harmless. She didn't like it at all, that's the least I can say. We had a very intense argument about this and she made me realize how wrong I was for joking about her being black and that if I didn't stop, she would just dump me. I did change my attitude and we left the awkwardness behind us and I never made any remarks after that. I was wrong and I changed. It's called growing up.\n\nSo my point is, people can change for the better if you make the effort to communicate your point of view and feelings about what is important for you. You're still both young and you can work it out. But, if she doesn't understand your side of the story after a good explanation, then yes, this a deal breaker and you should leave her and not look back.\n\nI hope this helps. NTA, obviously.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA. I don't think the friend was trying to be racist. I think she genuinely misunderstood what people said and thought they said Ricegum because, let's be honest, Bryce Hall and Rice Ricegum do sound pretty similar, especially if you can't quite hear what the other person is saying. I think she called you Ricegum later on because she was just trying to continue the joke, not understanding that she got it wrong, so from everyone else's perspective, it looks like you blew up over nothing. Or maybe she did say Bryce Hall, and you misunderstood her because she could have an accent. I'm Hispanic, and while English is my first language, I still have an accent, and sometimes people misunderstand what I say.", "NTA You embarrassed her by highlighting that her friend is a racist and by her excusing her friend she\u2019s also a bit racist too. Nothing like having your flaws slapped in your face to make you feel ashamed. The problem is rather than accepting this she\u2019d rather have a go at you that admit the truth, you need to find a new GF with hopefully a better group of friends.", "NTA but your gf is.", "NTA.\nYou have every right to not tolerate that behaviour.\nIf your girl friend cannot understand the situation, might be time to move on.", "NTA your gf is racist because you are the company you keep", "NTA Drop her, so she can eat ice cream with A.", "ESH. That\u2019s not racist. Racism is hate toward a race. A new friend trying to bond by making a joke isn\u2019t racism. You acted like a baby and stormed off instead of using your big kid words. Could have just said you don\u2019t like that and it\u2019s over. You put your gf in an unwinnable spot and then broke up with her over that.", "Nah do better and call her George Lopez or Gabriel iglesias", "I'm curious what an example of a super funny joke would be.", "I am a white lady who could absolutely be Matt Damon\u2019s long lost sister, this made me laugh so hard!!!", "I agree, even if OPs girlfriend isn't racist and is just too conflict averse to stick up for them, that's a problem. We live in a world where ppl will occasionally be racist towards you & we all deserve a SO who will take our side rather than try to avoid conflict.", "I overthink like a mofo, so when my (now ex) partner started meeting up with my people, I immediately went into \n\nOkay, if someone makes an out of pocket comment, how are we handling it?\n\nYou want me to say shit, or just back you up? \n\nBecause I can understand either side, they're my people, I can handle it. On the other hand, you're a grown ass adult and I'm not here to whitesplain on your behalf.\n\nWe can also just get right TF up and roll out. \n\nYou know what you don't do? Tell your PARTNER, yo you're embarrassing me for feeling offended at a racist joke. \n\nIf I had a partner try to excuse blatant sexism and tell me I'm embarrassing them, we'd have a deal breaker.\n\nNow, if partner is saying, it's cool I don't want a scene. I'll ignore it. It's their call.\n\nI'd hope someone would end it with me if I went rabid and thought this was okay to do to someone.", "Yes, I did, I asked A \u201c Did you actually hear ricegum or did you just say that to be funny?\u201d She started laughing and never responded to my question so that was enough for me to get my answer.", "Yeah it\u2019s not that A was right, it\u2019s that OP overreacted and stormed out. \n\nEveryone was silent after A\u2019s comment bc obviously they didn\u2019t agree. It\u2019s not like they all piled on him. Tell A not to call you that but don\u2019t storm out! \n\nThen OP was mad that the GF was \u201cdefending\u201d A, but everything he says she said wasn\u2019t a defense, it was attempting to diffuse the situation. And he\u2019s pissed GF didn\u2019t apologize but she\u2019s not the one who made the offensive comment it\u2019s not on her to apologize! It kind of sounds like A pissed him off and he took that anger out on the GF. \n\nI\u2019m also curious if A REALLY misheard \u201cBryce Hall\u201d as \u201cRicegum.\u201d They\u2019re not that far off each other. But the correct response is to tell her to stop calling you that, not storm out. \n\nESH except the GF honestly.", "How do you handle racial situations every time they happened to you, including when you were young?", "I understand where you\u2019re coming but, I did ask her after she said \u201cricegum?\u201d if she had heard ricegum or was trying to be funny and all i got was some laughter and not a response so i took it as she was trying to be \u201cfunny\u201d. She\u2019s hispanic but was born in the US and grew up in the US from what i\u2019ve been told and i didn\u2019t hear any sort of accent. Also after I had left she told my gf \u201c He should have called me a bean** and we would have been even\u201d. So obviously she was trying to be racist", "Or ask her what she\u2019s doing relaxing when she should be cleaning something\u2026 SMH (don\u2019t really do this!)", "What\u2019s Miranda singing about?", "Apparently calling a white girl \"Matt Damon\"", "Luckily, this relationship is new enough that you can just cut your losses now and find someone better for you.", "No sorry, if my partner's family is citing fake and racist statistics and spouting racism (happened to a friend, and luckily I witnessed it) they're rightfully gone. I'm not saying your partner has to make a scene, because there's a world of difference between that and pushing back politely with facts and why those opinions are prejudiced.", "I mean, I agree, but if you didn't know the YouTuber you might not even parse what they said. Like \"Ricegum\" doesn't sound like anything to me and I don't know if I'd even realise it was spelled that way if I heard someone say it with no context.", "I don't know who it is but I think OP's post explains it well enough. They are an asian YouTuber and it's implied OP bears no resemblance to them other than sort-of sharing a race.", "Oh, okay, I see. While yes, that was racist, I don't think she was actively trying to be. Hispanics, at least in my experience, like to have fun messing with people and have a very dark sense of humor, so we like to jokingly bring up race. I'm not trying to defend her actions. If she knew you didn\u2019t like the joke, she should have stopped, but instead shed some light on what her thought process probably was.", "That sitting with Nazis quote comes to mind here but I can never remember it. I\u2019m curious if gf is one of those people who would freak out if anyone pointed out her racism in defending the friend.\n\nNTA OP.", "My dumbass used to date someone like this decades ago. I learned the hard way that people excuse that behavior, and pretend their friend's racist \"jokes\" arent really racist tend to be manipulators and will gaslight tf out of you every time. You will always be the problem.", "That's still engaging in conflict, which OP didn't want to do.", "Yup, it's totally unacceptable.\n\nEach person has the right to decide how they want it handled. But partner should support it, as long as it's objectively reasonable.\n\nGood thing OPs GF showed her true colors early on, now he can bounce immediately\n\nHope he does. \n\nDid you have to call out friend's partner's family?? That's unacceptable", "Oh yeah, that's fair actually haha", "Oh, ok. All the comments were so very pointed that it seemed like there was some specific subtext I was missing.\nThank you.", "If there are 10 people at a table and 9 of them are nazis, you really have 10 nazis at the table", "In that situation, yes I did. In mine, my bf started speaking up but his sister cut him off. In a good way. He was trying to be diplomatic (their mom claim black people were happy being slaves) but did read her the riot act. We broke up but she my close friend until she died for that.", "There we go! Thanks!", "I\u2019m not sure you understand what it\u2019s like to deal with racism from women when you are a male POC. In those instances, we have to be VERY careful in how we respond to racism from women\u2014especially white women\u2014because we know the optics of a black or brown man being angry with a woman automatically makes the woman a victim in the eyes of many bystanders.", "She invited her boyfriend to hangout with a racist and let him be insulted twice and then defended the racist. But the gf did nothing wrong? Am i understanding that correctly?", "exactly this, I\u2019m a bigger guy who\u2019s been working out since high-school and she\u2019s a short hispanic women(her boyfriend was right next to her as well) If there had been any alteration I would have been labeled as the bad guy and i wanted to avoid that entirely.", "This also may not have been a safe situation to do so as someone else pointed out. Just because you have been able to do it doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is in a safe environment to call it out."]}
