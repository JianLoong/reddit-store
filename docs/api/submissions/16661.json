She is on a National team at a pretty good club. She typically plays setter but since last club season and grew from 5\u201910 to 6\u20191,Her coach took one look at her and decided she was too tall to do anything but hit so she plays right side.\n\nThere are 2 setters on the team. I\u2019ll call one of them Emily. Emily\u2019s mother is childhood best friends with the coach. And despite having played her entire life, she\u2019s not very good. Out of everything she does I\u2019d say the best probably is setting but many other girls on the team set better than her. Not only that but she is extremely cocky. Also, her mom is insufferable. She constantly corrects other people\u2019s kids and says she knows everything about the rules since her daughter has played the longest. \n\nWell about a month ago we had a big qualifier for nationals and our other setter couldn\u2019t make it. On the first day, Emily was doing awful. She was messing up every single play. Not setting the ball unless the pass was perfect, getting so many doubles and dumping it straight into the net. Her mom kept sideline coaching everyone but her kid. And said many times \u201cI know Emily\u2019s not having a good day but one player can\u2019t mess up the whole game.\u201d But if it\u2019s a setter, yes they can.\n\nThen the coach yelled at my daughters best friend for taking second ball when Emily didn\u2019t even go for it and then subbed her out. This made me so mad. After losing 2 consecutive matches to teams that were nowhere near our level,Emily said to everyone in the huddle that she\u2019s having a bad day so everyone has to play up for her and we\u2019re only losing because no one is hitting her sets.\n\nMe and 3 other parents decided to talk to the coach. We said that if Emily said herself she was having a bad day, maybe she shouldn\u2019t play anymore. She said being a setter takes experience and our girls don\u2019t have that. I made a deal with her that if my Daughter could set one match and won in 2 sets, she could set the rest the rest of the tournament.\n\nWell, not only did my daughter win in 2(to a really good team) but she had a recruiter approach her and tell her to consider their college. The coach tried to say that she said my daughter could set the rest of the day not the tournament, but we all called her out.\n\nEmilys mom was furious and said we were bullying a child and it was not okay. Her daughter still got to play DS but she was not okay with only getting 3 rotations so she left on the second day, we ended up going undefeated the second and third day and qualified for nationals. I do feel bad though, because Emily is only a kid. But I just feel that at a National level, this should be more about winning than sparing one kids feelings. Especially since the other girls are all held to much stricter standards. I feel like we could\u2019ve been nicer, but on the other hand, I think that was the only way to get the coach to listen to us. So AITA here?\n\nEdit: my daughter plays up an age level, this is a 16U team.", "created_utc": 1683497091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13b4h21/aita_for_making_a_bet_with_my_daughters_coach/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Playing ball could get your kid into college at a deep discount or even a free ride, it\u2019s not just a summer league. I understand the frustration just be sure you direct it correctly.", "A big qualifier tournament for national teams.\n\nThis isn't kiddie league\n\nNTA", "NTA if the coach saw a recruiter approach another kid why not use that kid... soon coach wont have a team... having a bad day doesn't mean screw the team over...", "NTA.  I\u2019m not going to popular here.  But the coach is nuts, I got benched because I didn\u2019t perform Hitting my free throws.  I practiced and got better, was never benched again.  There is a difference between fun leagues and college recruiting level sports.   Top players get playing time to impress the scouts.  Sad but true.", "NTA. This is not just a community competition with kids from school (where equal play is expected) but a high-level travel team. If the coach wasn\u2019t constrained by favoritism, Emily wouldn\u2019t have been playing anyway.", "NTA. Coach wasn't doing his job. Either this is a competitive team who should put winning as a priority or this is a participation team where everyone should get to try all the positions. In neither case does their friends kid get to take over a preferred spot if they aren't earning it.", "NTA, the coach, wasn't doing his job. My brother plays competitive hockey and has been benched for less. \n\nI agree with people in the comments that there is a huge parent problem in youth sports, but in this instance, the problem wasn't you it was Emily's mom. as parents, we have to admit when our kids are off, especially when it's affecting others. This was an important competition, and losing it doesn't just affect Emily but everyone else on the team, and you guys stayed quiet as long as you could. It was Emily's mom who was sideline coaching, and it was Emily's mom who decided to leave early bc her daughter wasn't getting enough playing time.\n\nThe people in the comments saying \"she's 14,\" aren't really understanding how youth sports work, honestly we all want the kids to have fun, but that just have fun attitude is for the younger leagues once the kids hit the high school age 16U, it has to be taken more seriously and part of the fun is from winning, and playing your best. Everyone keeps saying it's not that serious. \"It's not the olympics\" don't understand that these are the years that can help them get to those professional levels. These are the years where the spotlight is there, and scouts are present, and to these kids, playing it is serious, and it is important.\n\nThese are also the years that can determine college scholarships and their future in the sport. Yes, have fun but also play your best. Every time I speak to my brother about a game for him and his teammates, the hardest part is losing a game you know you should've won whether it be from people not playing their best, not trying or bad coaching. Knowing the team as a whole didn't give it their all. Emily had a bad weekend, and I'm sure her feelings were hurt, but the entire team would've been devastated to lose that tournament, and I'm sure their reactions would've hurt Emily a lot more. \n\nAlso, fair is fair, if other kids are consistently being held accountable and benched, but Emily is getting a chance after chance that resentment is going to build in the locker room and really hurt the team. There's no I in TEAM. The coach was supposed to be doing what was best for the team, not what was best for Emily. NTA", "NTA the coach was obviously not being professional", "NTA at all. Not only bc of the stakes but the time money and effort that the parents and kids put in for that team. If it was Rec ball you\u2019d be way overstepping, but it was literally a tournament to qualify for nationals!", "ESH. I've read the other comments just for perspective and find myself agreeing with both sides. \n\nAt this level, the coach has to field the best team no matter whose feelings are hurt. He was not doing his job.\n\nOn the other hand, even though it's clear that the parents were thinking more objectively than the coach (as demonstrated by the results), the drama flare-up is a great demonstration of why parents shouldn't be helicoptering in: hurt feelings, Emily leaving early, everyone picking a side. Not great for team morale, I bet. \n\nThis is one of the many AITA? cases where the best course of action would be to deal with the long-simmering problem before arriving at a high-stakes crisis. If you'd laid better groundwork, you wouldn't have had to resort to a \\*bet\\*, which is a tactic that makes for a very fun sports comedy but is not actually advisable in real life.", "YTA\n\nYOU are the problem with youth sports.", "YTA you\u2019re not the coach. You don\u2019t get to act like the coach.", "YTA. \n\nI actually had to go back and check the ages multiple times because I can\u2019t fathom an adult speaking about a young teenager this way. You\u2019re all ganging up on a kid because you don\u2019t like her mother. It\u2019s a GAME. Assuming she\u2019s around your daughters age, you\u2019re picking on a child. \n\nThese girls are people, not pawns for your adult drama.

You are why sports parents have such a bad reputation.", "Sounds like there's too many cooks in this kitchen.

Parents shouldn't be that involved with coaching decisions. It's part of what ruins youth sports. Just because it worked out a time or two doesn't mean it's ok. \n\nThe coach should have recognized the issue from the start though and not went back on his word. He needs to be willing to do what is needed when it is an expensive travel team. People typically pay good money to be on these teams and the expectations are different than regular HS sports teams.", "ESH\n\nYou and all the other parents who complained to the coach, and Emily's mom, sound like the kinds of parents who make their kids not want to play sports. Your daughter was probably thrilled to play setter. She was also probably utterly embarrassed by your behavior. \n\nThe coach was absolutely not doing the job properly, but you're setting a terrible example of teamwork and good sportsmanship to the girls. This is NOT how the problem should have been handled.", "YTA\n\nSure, she may be the worst player on the best team but that\u2019s on the coach to play her or pull her. She probably knows she\u2019s not up to par like the other players but doesn\u2019t have the skills or know-how to deal with that other than to make excuses like \u201chaving a bad day\u201d. \n\nYou sound like one of those parents that thinks competitive sports are going to make their kid famous. Many great athletes never make it past the collegiate level so maybe take your expectations down a notch. Support your kid, but also support the entire team.", "Imagine being a 44 yo man bitterly complaining to the coach of a youth volleyballteam to bench a 14yo.. You even got other parents involved?

(Team fees, gas/travel for tourneys/uniforms if they\u2019re out of pocket, etc). \n\nI never played volleyball but I played soccer, and our parents had to spend tons of money and time just for us to be on the team. If this had happened on my soccer team, not only would all the girls and other parents be happy some parents advocated for better players, but if they didn\u2019t, as players we would feel betrayed. As a player you really have no authority to tell the coach where to put you or when.

How would you feel if your daughter played a bad game and some adults made a bet with her coach to prove that she sucks. \n\nThe way you described Emily's mom seems alot like projecting btw.", "Oh yeah NTA by a mile !!!!", "I really don\u2019t mean to be. My daughter has had bad games but whenever she does she gets yelled at and taken out. And she deserves it. This whole thing has been building up all season and everyone on the team(as well as other members of the club) have been aware of it. But at a national qualifier it felt like something had to be said."]}
