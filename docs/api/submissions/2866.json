So I suspect you're right.", "Oh stop it. She's not an asshole for reporting on someone's life.", "School doesn't want to get sued if she gets hurt doing a story for them.", "The important question is whether those things are OPs property and whether she paid and pays for those things? If yes, they don't have the right to take her property. If not, I struggle to see how taking her phone and car are productive to the situation. I guess OP can just buy her own cheap anyways.", "It\u2019s such an unkind story though.

There\u2019s no journalistic merit to this, the former student deserves better than being treated as news fodder.", "Some camps are dangerous, others are not, depends on who's there at the time.

YTA here, hate to say it because your heart is in the right place, and your ambition is admirable.", "Then I'm unfortunately going to have to go with YTA.\n\nI fully support your decision to engage in important journalism - we are in desperate need of people willing to take risks to cover the stories that impact our communities. However, one of the most important parts of being a journalist - even more important than the story itself - is how you get the story. It sounds like your broke the policy of your journalistic organization (school paper). You also didn't answer my question about what safety precautions you took, which leads me to believe that you may not have taken any?\n\nIf that is the case, then you put yourself in an potentially very dangerous situation. I don't know what the camps are like in your area, but having worked with those communities in the past i can tell you those areas can be incredibly dangerous for an unaccompanied young person - not necessarily even from those who are living in those camps (plenty of people without housing are kind and amazing folks having a rough time) but potentially from those who prey on them. Sex trafficking in particular has become increasingly rampant as of late, and traffickers love to hang around those areas.\nOf course, journalists regularly need to enter unsafe situations, which is why taking precautions is so important - researching the areas ahead of time, having another person with you or nearby but ready, making sure others know where you are going and when you plan to return, using a tracking app, having a safe word and doing regular checkins - there are lots of ways you can engage in potentially dangerous journalism but still be as safe as possible.\n\nIn addition, part of being a journalist means understanding how to work with the rules of your organization - sometimes you break those rules, but you need to be prepared to accept the backlash from that.\n\nIm definitely not telling you to stop your journalism - instead let this be a learning moment. The best journalists are born through experience and passion, and it sounds like you're on the right track. Just remmber that you want want be around to cover lots of stories- and not to become one yourself.", "Yeah, I have to say YTA here. You\u2019re ambition is wonderful but, you broke protocol and went about getting the story in an unsafe way. As someone who works in a high-risk job, I understand that danger is inherent in what I do but, I follow safety protocols and work with others when needed to ensure I\u2019m doing my dangerous job as safe as possible. You ought to have obtained permission from school and not gone alone into that environment.", "Was HE upset that you showed up to interview him? I think that also matters in this judgement; as long as you were polite and didn't make him feel like shit over it. I can see someone interpreting the follow up as being kicked while one is down, but again, it just depends on how you went about speaking to him. Based on your responses here, I'm leaning NTA", "I hate to be that person, but they should be. Sadly with the state of funding of mental health resources, there are a lot of homeless individuals with severe and untreated mental health issues which can cause unpredictable behavior. I am not saying they would intentionally seek to hurt you, but it could happen accidentally. I work in Hospice, we go where our patients live, and sometimes that is in homeless camps. Every single one of us is required to do joint visits with our homeless patients. As medical professionals, ranging in age from 29 to 52, we are not allowed to go alone. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a woman or a man, we cannot go alone. And a coworker has been injured to the point of urgent care before when someone shoved her because they were having delusions and thought she was a government agent there to take them away. Please know that your parents and school leaders are only looking out for your safety (and their liability).", "I think that they would still be upset if a young man had gone alone into the homeless encampments.  This is about safety, not about the story.", "That was an absolutely dangerous move on your part and I\u2019m glad you are okay.\n\nOutreach workers, who are trained and actually know the people they\u2019re meeting, travel in pairs for a reason. No one knew where you were.", "ESH as you should have not gone alone, but I think some of that's a smokescreen. People like success stories. They don't like failure stories that make them uncomfortable. They will seize onto an excuse to berate you for destroying that comfort.", "In Vancouver, Canada a police office was recently stabbed and died while serving as a escort for social worker in a homeless encampment. You definitely should have brought back up.", "The security thing is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nBut the misery porn about homeless people is disgusting.", "There is a ton of context missing here, including the location of the camp, whether it was proximate to high traffic areas, the time of day and weather, and where in the camp you conducted your interview.  Probably not the safest idea given what you told us, but journalists do need to take risks.  Maybe buddy up next time at a minimum and tell people where you\u2019re going, but it sounds like the adults want you to have SWAT on standby, which would be overkill.", "Honestly, OP, it's your life and your career and your decision on what risks are acceptable. Make sure you *understand* the risks before deciding on something, but a lot of journalism jobs can involve putting yourself in risky situations. It is fine to decide that, for you, these risks are acceptable. \n\nJust make sure you do your research and understand the risks before jumping into a situation.", "Odds are that you will be fine going to a homeless camp. But some people are homeless due to serious mental health and/or drug abuse reasons. They are unpredictable and not a place you should go with out back up or letting people know. \n\nVery recently in Canada a police officer was killed in a homeless camp. She was community outreach and the man reacted violently and stabbed her.", "If they are concerned about it because you are female, that is a sexist double standard.", "yeah, at that point you work to try and convince either your teacher adviser or your friends or your parent - using your *words* as a journalist ought to.\n\ninstead you chose instead to ask forgiveness instead of permission and now you're facing consequences for that. which, frankly? you should be very thankful that the only consequences you're facing are losing your position and your car. this could've been *very bad* for you.", "For a good reason, too. You're way too reckless. YTA.\n\nIf you'd thought of this like a professional (or, you know, like an adult), you would've either found a way to convince the school to send someone with you to the interview for your own safety, or done the interview in a safe and public place.\n\nThis \"I'm gonna ask for forgiveness and not permission rah rah rah\" stuff makes you look very immature and not someone the adults around you should trust.", "Just buy your own cheap phone and get a cheap plan or just pay prepaid. They can't legally take a phone you bought yourself. Maybe see if you can get a part time job for the mean time for the money and work experience and a bike if you can. Plus you can still walk places. If your parents are concerned about you walking or biking places, just tell them to give you your car back if they are so concerned.", "You're 18 and work for your school newspaper, you don't know how journalism works", "You're 18 and work for your school newspaper, you don't know how journalism works.", "I noticed that too.  OP is definitely active and engaging with commenters, she just doesn\u2019t want to address *why* she wanted to do this story in the first place.", "it\u2019s hard to know because i don\u2019t know the nature of the story. \n\nbut in my opinion, it depends on why. and if she\u2019s doing it to show the world how fucked up someone with such a promising future can get or as i said \u201chow far the mighty have fallen\u201d then yeah. that\u2019s not very kind. it\u2019s actually pretty fucking lousy. if you think the star football player who had every opportunity in life becoming homeless is newsworthy - that\u2019s sad. using someone else\u2019s misfortune to get a pat on the back - that\u2019s sad. if the story is literally just about someone who is up and then down, well that\u2019s not really even news. and if that\u2019s what OP is doing, if i were OP, I\u2019d be thinking about what type of person and journalist I wanna be. blasting someone like that isn\u2019t okay in my book. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if it is in yours - eek. \n\nnow if this is about more than that - like for example, telling his story and helping him - and then sharing resources for people in similar situations or whatever.. if it\u2019s bringing light to the issues of addiction or mental health, homelessness and the things that go along with that, or the issues in OPs community or whatever - that\u2019s different. \n\nthis all depends on the story. \n\nand that\u2019s the beauty of opinions - everyone can have their own. sorry you don\u2019t like mine, lol. \n\nETA: i\u2019m all for people chasing their dreams. it takes hard work to get what you want. but don\u2019t drag anyone through the mud to get where you wanna be.", "Especially if he agreed to be interviewed and gave her permission to write his story.", "I get it, and I agree. But maybe they could give safety tips instead of going nuclear?", "The former student can always say no? She was looking for him and apparently willing to talk. There is indeed no merit writing about it without his own statement. \n\nThe question here isn't about that, the question is if she's got the freedom to do her journalistic work free from her parents and school. \n\nHowever, it's definitely wrong to write about him without his input. He's a person not an event/company/disaster. If he didn't consent to a follow up and there's nothing that would help in any way there's not really a point to wrote about him. \n\nSo I agree with you in some way but my point was more about her being free in her actions as she's an adult.", "I think sharing his story should be solely his decision. If he wants his story told then go for it but if he doesn\u2019t then maybe getting him help privately is what should happen.", "Would you like me to link some stories about people who were minding their own business in safe places (like college campuses) being assaulted?
