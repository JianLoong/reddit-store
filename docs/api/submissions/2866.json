A police officer who risked his life climbing over roofs to arrest a criminal should be told off becuase he risked his life and those around him to make the arrest and preserving life (in the UK) is an officer's first responsibility. \n\nSo you might have got a great result with that story but you need to think about how you got there and how you could improve in future.", "NTA thank you for seeing homeless people for what they are.... People. They have feelings just like those that are lucky enough to have a roof over their heads. But that being said.... Safety is #1.

Offer these solutions to the school paper see if that with appease them. I certainly don't see any reason to remove you from the paper. Best of luck.... Not sure where you are but why not ask the school to do a jacket drive or blanket drive for the homeless. Good luck and I wish everyday for homelessness to end.

I remember he would be eating dinner and get a call and run out the door. He\u2019s got photos after a bombing where there\u2019s a head on the ground.
