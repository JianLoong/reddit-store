There is nothing wrong with liking your privacy but the combination of being extra protective of your phone + having a mysterious source of income does, through no fault of your own, raise a red flag.", "I think they mean when OP told is gf that he had a good amount of money enough to be able to not have to work but not wanting to disclose how much or why he got it, that she went and tattled to her parents so they could gang up on him to find out how much OP has and why.", "> would be willing to discuss it as the relationship progressed.\n> \n> \n> \n> However, my girlfriend and her parents have been relentless in their questioning about my money and how I acquired it, despite me telling them several times that I don't want to discuss it further. \n\nI read this as even before the phone incident. Could be wrong, but I don't feel like it is.\n\nIf this is pre-phone incident, she ran and tattled to her parents. \n\nIf not, it's still an invasion, and OP is still NTA, but yeah, I'd be ... slightly less concerned? Except her parents still feel entitled to decide the terms of their relationship... hmm...\n\nI think I'd feel the same either way, lol", "Could have been as simple as they asked what he does for a living. She said nothing. How does he have any money. I don't know he won't tell me. See how that sounds dodgy for a parent.", "Its in the r/personalfinance Wiki, highly recommend checking it out.", "So when is enough enough? She keeps pushing your boundaries, with no intent to stop, and her family is in on it too.\n\nNTA but it sounds like you can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t trust this person, so not sure if it makes sense to be with them.", "My concern is that even though she might be feeling left out and not sure how to handle you, due to not knowing anything about that part of your life, she didn't hesitate to treat your phone as her property, with backup from Daddy. That's a huge red flag, whatever the circumstances. I don't think she is respectful enough of privacy to not tell all and sundry when you finally open up. And if you choose not to open up, you've got this behaviour for the rest of your life.", "Dude, what are you waiting for?  She's been continuously pushing your boundaries.  You deserve someone better.  NTA but you will be Y T A if you stay with her.", "After 13 months she deserves to know *something* about both the trauma and your finances, so she can decide whether she sees a future with you. Her family is out of line, but they probably have the same concern about her wasting time in a dead-end relationship (they might even be wondering whether there is something illegal in regard to your secrecy or the money).\n\nNot saying you have to completely expose yourself and your bank account.  But a general idea about the trauma and the settlement.  Maybe couples' therapy would get the ball rolling.\n\nEven if it's not with this girl, any life partner is going to expect to know a certain amount of your background and financial situation. Figure this out.", "Run. How long have you being dating this girl? Is normal not to disclosure financial information, what shouldn't be happening is them stomping over you boundaries and you having to answer to your girlfriend and HER family.\n\nThink about the future, are you willing to deal with his situation the rest of your family? This is the future you want for you? If not, them you are delaying the inevitable...\n\nAlso, why do they want to know that? What impact does it have on their life? What are the expectations from your girlfriend into the future? Does she want to be maintained and not work? When you go out, who pays? Does she ask you to pay for her stuff (shoes, clothes, etc.)? Does she make you pay for her family? Think about this...(don't have to answer, is just to give perspective)", "Ah, okay, yeah I see that now. I missed the part about the GFs dad getting on OP about the money and the phone, thought it was just the phone.", "Ahh I found it. Thats pretty much the way that I am living.  Currently I am using it to fund my way through university and now into my masters. But the end goal is to just keep putting it all into an account each year that I receive it. I don't buy flashy things or new cloths all of the time. Tbh I don't know the last time that I went shopping to clothes. The only real way that anyone would know is that I have a car and an apartment that are slightly above average. Outside of those two things I look just like a normal average working person. Wake up at 6/7 come home at 5/6.", "No she doesn't deserve to know anything about OP's personal trauma when she can't follow simple directions. I think it's obvious to infer what may have happened to OP so to force someone who doesn't want to talk about their trauma to do just that is cruel and heartless. and to tell her parents about it and the money was wrong. That's not her business to share with them.   \nOP already said they were willing to share on their terms which is fair but they can't trst the girlfriend. The finances are absolutely unnecessary to talk about. OP has more than enough to live and not have to work.", "Erm no.", "NTA\n\nif marriage is in your future, eventually your spouse should know the number. financial planning and whatnot. \n\n\nbut that doesnt sound like the issue here and you're right to not share. \n\nFIL &GF: \"i have the money because something horrible happened. my family doesnt even have the specifics. Stop asking me\" and walk away if they do", "IMO, GF and her family want to know what their \u201cpayday\u201d will be if the relationship progresses, or if the amount isn\u2019t enough for her to stay interested.  It\u2019s one thing if she legitimately is curious about the trauma\u2026.that\u2026I could maybe understand.  But the fact that they seem so concerned about the money is a pretty obvious red flag.", "exactly"]}
