My fianc\u00e9 and I had a baby in mid 2022, and since then my MIL and SIL have completely changed towards me. At a week post partum we visited them so that they could bond with our baby, and my MIL ended up yelling at me because of a conversation between my fianc\u00e9 and I where we were discussing fees for a medical appointment and she was listening in.

After that we went to a lunch with my in laws and my fianc\u00e9s grandparents, his grandma smokes and when she would light a cigarette we would take our baby for a walk around the garden to get away from the smoke, we weren\u2019t rude or obvious about it at all. This resulted in my MIL calling my fianc\u00e9 and I rude and having a go at him over this, when my fianc\u00e9 told her that if she continues to act like this she will no longer be allowed around us and our children.
