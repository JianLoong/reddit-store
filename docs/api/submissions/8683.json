She was extremely excited as was I, and at the time we got along really well. \nMy fianc\u00e9 and I finally locked in our wedding for October 2024, but his sister and I no longer get along. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a baby in mid 2022, and since then my MIL and SIL have completely changed towards me. At a week post partum we visited them so that they could bond with our baby, and my MIL ended up yelling at me because of a conversation between my fianc\u00e9 and I where we were discussing fees for a medical appointment and she was listening in. After that my SIL took her side and we didn\u2019t speak much. After that we went to a lunch with my in laws and my fianc\u00e9s grandparents, his grandma smokes and when she would light a cigarette we would take our baby for a walk around the garden to get away from the smoke, we weren\u2019t rude or obvious about it at all. This resulted in my MIL calling my fianc\u00e9 and I rude and having a go at him over this, when my fianc\u00e9 told her that if she continues to act like this she will no longer be allowed around us and our children. My SIL then called my fianc\u00e9 and began abusing us over the phone, and calling me a whore and a bunch of other names. \n\nDue to this, I no longer want her to be one of my bridesmaids, and I am thinking about firing her. We currently don\u2019t talk even at family events, and have each other blocked on social media, so I think it\u2019s assumed that she\u2019s no longer a bridesmaid anyway. But I will need to clarify it with her at some stage so there\u2019s no confusion.

If someone called my wife a whore they would no longer be invited to the wedding end of story.", "NTA. SIL is absolutely miserable. I can\u2019t imagine she would want to be your bridesmaid anymore anyway.\n\nAlso, anyone who smokes in a closed room and insists that a **newborn** stay in that room is outrageous. That is just **outrageous**", "NTA. Like you said, I think it is already implied, so go ahead and make it official.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and you can remove anyone you want from your wedding party.", "NTA. She's abusive and doesn't deserve to be around your kid. Personally wouldn't even invite her to the wedding.", "She lost the honour to be a bridesmaid long ago, don't feel bad about cutting her out. But do run it by your fiance first, so that you're on the same page about this. **NTA**", "NTA - you already dont talk and interact so this makes sense. You dont need someone like that as part of your wedding.", "NTA There is plenty of time between now and the wedding and no money has been spent. Just send a text that while you had been looking forward to having her as a bridesmaid, her recent behavior has left you upset and that if you two can't work this out for the sake of the greater family dynamic that you don't want the in the wedding party.", "NTA personally, if go no contact or very minimal contact Also....WHO TF SMOKES NEXT TO A BABY!?\nIt sounds like you and your baby are better off without the inlaws.\nGlad your fiance is sticking up for his family", "NTA.  I'm surprised you even need to ask.  These people do not care about you, so they shouldn't even be invited to an event meant to celebrate your happiness and relationship as a couple.", "NTA. It's your wedding. Nobody has any power over this event except for you.\n\nFurthermore, why would you willingly allow someone abusive into one of the best moments of your life? You aren't obligated to reward anyone for disrespecting you.", "YWNBTA if you fired her. But make sure your fiance agrees with that.", "NTA. If you two no longer get along, there's no point in having her act as your bridesmaid.", "YWNBTA if you fired her, so long as you let her know at some point. I agree with you that she probably wants nothing to do with the wedding at this point", "YWNBA. \n\nThings change, things happen, people drift apart...\n\nIn this case, it sounds like she doesn't support you guys or the life you guys live together....And these are two very key things a MOH SHOULD do since the role is not only an honor, but a big responsibility and integral to the planning and execution of the wedding (along with supporting you).   \n\n\nObviously, she's probably not going to be able to support you and I don't feel like she'd be that invested in the wedding planning activities because of your falling out. And it would probably be WAY MORE drama than it needs to be. And wedding planning can already be stressful. You don't need any extra on top of that. haha. So, it would just make logical sense that you would no longer have her as MOH.", "So your MIL eavesdropped on a conversation that had NOTHING to do with her, gossiped about it, and has decided to take umbrage. You, very rightly, remove your infant from second hand smoke and they get mad at you about that? Honestly, I\u2019d fire them all from my life. \n\nNTA.", "YTNBTA! Why did the family change their behavior towards you? Because you had a baby? Regardless, their behavior is unacceptable. Your fiance needs to step up and handle them. Boundaries need to be set and respected.\n\nOf course you should tell your SIL she's no longer in the wedding party. I'm not sure I'd invite any of his family to the wedding.", "I take your question to be not about firing her, but making it official with a clear communication.\n\nNo I think you WNBTA if you formally fired an ex-bridesmaid who already blocked you when they're prone to overthinking, overreacting, and punishing you after the fact. You're trading a strong possibility she'll have a meltdown now for a dangerous possibility she'll have one later.", "NTA. I probably wouldn\u2019t tell her. I would just move on and plan without her. If she asks, just say we are no longer close/friends so I chose people that I\u2019m close/friends with. Just put as much distance between the two of you in the next year and she\u2019ll get the hint.", "Sounds like she's quit already...\n\nNTA but it's a pity that the relationship has turned so sour. If you have a mind to work on the relationship then you could offer a fig leaf by inviting her to have a  conversation in good faith about it.", "NTA. I honestly wouldn't even want to invite both of them to the wedding. Especially with their nasty behavior. Not that hard to be nice", "WNBTA\n\nI would agree that is is pretty much clear that she will not be a bridesmaid, but let her know just to rub it in a bit.", "NTA\n\n>we weren\u2019t rude or obvious about it at all.\n\nOP, if Granny lit a smoke and you just MYSTERIOUSLY got up and left every time, yeah - they'd have to be blind to miss that one.  It was more obvious than you probably thought.   I get it, I hate smoke too, but it was not this super casual \"We just keep happening to take walks when Granny smokes\" kind of thing.\n\n>am thinking about firing her\n\nIt's your right to not have her as a bridesmaid (I likely wouldn't in this case either).  However, the phrasing \"She's fired!\" implies that you think of your bridesmaids as employees and not cherished friends or family that you want to support you on your big day, which is not the greatest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wasn\u2019t sure what other word to use. Asking her to step down perhaps?", "The money discussion wasn\u2019t discussing who would pay fees or what not. We have a concession card which means our GP appointments are usually free, my fianc\u00e9 got charged quite a lot for one and we were trying to figure out why. His mum came into the conversation and said that she always pays full price, and when I explained to her that we usually get appointments for free or heavily discounted, she began yelling at me because she thought I was telling her that she was wrong. \n\nI got along amazingly with his family prior to having a baby, we had never had any issues before. This happened completely out of the blue a week after I gave birth, and then continued weeks later at another family event because we wanted to keep our baby away from secondhand cigarette smoke (which is very harmful for them).\nIt wasn\u2019t a disagreement at all, my fianc\u00e9 and I were trying to figure out why his appointment was so expensive and she began yelling at me. Hence why I haven\u2019t apologised, because I didn\u2019t do anything wrong there.", "Also, I\u2019m not sure where you got the idea that I\u2019m keeping my children away from their grandparents from. None of that was ever mentioned in the post, and our children see his parents quite frequently.", "Ah thanks for the clarification. Not trying to be rude, but even though things were different a while ago, Grandma should know that it hasn\u2019t been acceptable to smoke around children at all for the past 30 years. But as you say, of course SIL can take a walk without being attacked by MIL \ud83d\ude48 ridiculous.", "I would just say \"Hey, we're clearly not getting along and feel it would be inappropriate for you to continue on as a bridesmaid\"."]}
