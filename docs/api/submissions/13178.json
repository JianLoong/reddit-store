Your younger son is not your older son. You shouldn\u2019t expect them to be the same person or be motivated by the same thing.

A nice dinner out is good. Maybe every semester he gets mostly As he can pick the restaurant, but $300 shoes is a bit much.\n\nBut here is some food for thought: different kids have different priorities. Someone who wants to become a lawyer will care a lot more than someone who wants to become a carpenter. Also, school is harder for some kids than others. Maybe your older son got good grades without even trying, but the younger one worked really hard to get those good grades to make you proud. School isn't easy for everyone, so maybe he feels like he is being shut down by you and taken for granted. This is just one interpretation, but you might consider it.", "NTA\n\nHe may have friends who're being rewarded for good grades which has influenced him. I think a reward system for grades is more common than you think, even though I agree that it should be expected. When I finished secondary school it was almost common practice to you'd get a certain amount of money for every A on the transcript.", "NTA. I'm a teacher and there's a whole literature out there about rewards and motivations. The problem with having a direct, very explicit relationship between a grade and a reward is that the child can quickly internalize that the whole point of school is to get a reward. That's a bad idea because eventually the direct rewards won't be there and the kid might have no motivation to try. You want the child to want to learn and do well for the sake of learning and doing well. Kids who learn to do that are going to be successful in any circumstance.", "NAH. Sounds like normal family bickering.", "Info: If he had gotten straight Bs would you have given him a hard time about it?", "YTA for expecting straight As. Way to pressure your kid. Maybe set the expectation that they kid works hard and does his best?", "You're NTA. A $300 reward for doing his job in school is an insane request as far as I'm concerned. If denying this demand is \"cruel\" in his mind, he has a great life.", "NTA\n\nMaybe graduating with honors he can get rewarded, but for a transcript?  I don't think so.  A nice dinner out is fine.  $300 shoes?  Nope.", "NAH. But I will say, kids do deserve some appreciation for doing the work of getting good grades because it's not easy. We have a teen who had straight A's for five years, and we always got him a little something (tee shirt, fun variety of snacks, a game on Steam) as a little special surprise. Now that he's hit his super-hard sophomore year and struggling, honestly-- we are acknowledging and praising effort, not grades. I think you might want to talk to your son about ways he can earn money, because it sounds like he wants a bigger-ticket item. Does he have time to work after school/weekends? Or is his course load prohibitive of him using that time for working? Because if that's the case, you might want to rethink expectations.", "ESH\nSaying that straight As are just what is expected of being an asshole, demanding 300 bucks shoes is equally entitled and assholish.", "Soft YTA. I totally understand the desire to set your kid up for success, but as a person that was always expected to get good grades in school with little/no recognition, that shit sucked.  Sure the work may seem easy to adults, but at that age, it takes real, continuous effort and sacrifice. \n\nIt's unclear whether your son was demanding expensive shoes (in which case it's E S H) or just asking for them and using them as an example, but I assumed more asking based on the language you used. Regardless, it definitely seems like more discussion with your son should be had here. Perhaps he would have preferred the shoes to the dinner? Also, consider discussing what his close friends' families do to incentivize good academic performance, not to copy them but for context. I used to hear constantly how my friends would get $500 if their report card looked like mine.\n\nI get that putting in good effort now will ultimately help him in myriad ways, but teenagers generally don't have the perspective to understand how the decisions they make at that age impact their lives. It's important to be realistic about your expectations - \"good\" grades (and good enough grades to do well later in life) is a lot different than only A's.\n\nThere is also more to life than good grades and more to being a complete human than just being book smart. Instead of forcing your rubric for success on your child, maybe talk to them and learn what's important to them. Fovus on being an advocate and a collaborative problem solver for your child instead of an enforcer.\n\nIt's helpful to teach children that their time/effort/attention is a choice, and then help them make good choices about where to \"spend\" their efforts.

I also get high grades and I can understand wanting a reward or recognition for all the hard work that went into those grades. I do agree that $300 shoes seems wasteful. Maybe get him so candy or something.", "NTA. Telling a kid no because they want expensive shoes is not cruel.", "YTA, you aren't expecting good grades out of your kids. You're expecting perfection while also not wanting to admit that it's anything more than average.

Is it like you ground them or punish them and yell or is it like a hey do better next semester?", "ESH. Expecting good grades puts a LOT of undue pressure on young people. The expectation should be of their effort, not the result. If a kid tries their hardest and only gets a C, they shouldn\u2019t be punished. Their effort is the important thing. Not everyone will get an A+ result for A+ effort and that has to be OK. Do not tie up your child\u2019s worth (and self worth) with the result. \n\nHowever, your kid is coming off super entitled, demanding they be rewarded for the grades. If it\u2019s coming out of left field then you need to sit with your child and TALK to them. Why do they think that they should be getting a reward when that\u2019s not something you\u2019ve ever done? Do they have a friend who is rewarded for those things? Where is this new attitude coming from? \n\nAlso, your kids is old enough to get a job. Might be time to start having the conversation about making their own money. Big life lessons on what you *earn*.", "NTA \n\nYour son sounds very entitled.", "YTA for setting such a useless expectation. Your child's only expectation should be to try their best and make the most out of their life. Your child owes you nothing. \n\nAnd for comparing the two kids. They are two independent individuals with their own thoughts, ideas and life experiences.\n\nA teenager would pay you to not have to go out for dinner with you.

The rest will be on him.", "Asking for $300 shoes for doing well in school is kinda crazy. Praise for a job well done makes people feel valued, but expecting to receive a pricey item for doing what's required of you is just a bad precedent. When he grows up, his boss will most likely not give him anything more than a \"good job,\" if that. My kids like pricey shoes as well, but we have an agreement that they pay for half. And grades don't count as money. They earn it by extra chores and helping out elderly family members with yard work or household chores they can no longer do themselves. I also found that they take care of their stuff better when they helped pay for it. They take more pride in the item as well.\n\n\nEta: I just saw your comment about grounding your son if he gets a B and have changed my vote to YTA.", "NTA and there's plenty of evidence that external rewards decrease intrinsic motivation. I'd have a good chat with him (maybe several) to clarify that good grades are something HE does for HIMSELF and his own future. That if he was or is struggling, you'll absolutely help, but this is about him and for him. \n\nBut I think you should also do some soul searching about why straight As are \"expected\" and how you'd feel and react if he weren't able to get those. Many wonderful people never got straight As. By definition, most people CAN'T get them because grades usually use a bell curve. \"Straight As are expected\" reads like \"All students should be above average\". And if you were a straight A student, you should see how nonsensical that is.  Does he know you love him unconditionally, whether he does well at school or struggles? Is he asking for a material present or is he asking you to be proud of him and love him? Is he using material gifts as a yardstick of love/pride because that's what you've taught him? These aren't rhetorical questions, I don't know the answers, but they're important to think about. Before you talk to him.", "NTA. My dad always told me \u201cyour grades are your pay\u201d \nIt made sense when I got older and realized my grades could get me into schools other when others grades may not get them into those same schools. \n\nOf course now colleges are ditching merit based applications so this may be outdated advice", "NTA - kids don\u2019t need to be rewarded for good grades or goals scored.", "NTA because of the price but I always got a few euro for each A.

Hold your ground and let him know you're proud of him for his good grades. Focus on his good work and keep your expectations reasonable.

I was one of them, so I didn't expect my parents to reward me for it. What was there to reward, my genetics? I didn't have to try. If your son naturally finds school relatively easy, then there's nothing to reward, any more than you would reward him for breathing.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he was consistently staying up late to study, or doing a bunch of extra credit, or otherwise putting in real, hard work for classes he struggled with...I would consider giving him a nicer reward than just a dinner, as a symbol of being proud of his efforts. Maybe not $300 dollars, but something.\n\nAs a side note, is your son provided an allowance (if you can afford it)?

This pressure has been building and building over decades; each generation continues to be even more stressed about it than the one before. It\u2019s really difficult when the measure of your success is external and quantifiable. Someone else decides whether you succeeded or not (the teacher) and there is a number attached to tell you exactly how well or how poorly you did. Of course, this is just how grades work and I\u2019m def not suggesting we SHOULDN\u2019T give grades. They are necessary for the system we currently have. But it can create a real pressure cooker of a situation if kids aren\u2019t given the appropriate tools to handle it.\n\nTo say A\u2019s are the expectation is to say you expect perfection. An A is literally the highest grade he can get. And really, A\u2019s should NOT be the expectation.

Your expectations of him should be entirely about his behavior, and not his results.\n\nI also do not think you should buy him $300 shoes to reward him, and the dinner and congratulations you\u2019ve already given him are perfectly appropriate. The reward for education is the education itself. Kids think that idea is stupid, and most of them only try for good grades because they want external rewards and/or want to avoid punishments. But it really is true, and if you model the correct behavior a lot eventually, sometimes, they start to believe it. Tell him his reward for those grades is the information he learned that he can carry with him going forward. The foundation he is building that can help him be successful with whatever he wants to do in the future. The knowledge that when he sets his mind to something, he is capable of achieving it. Encourage him to take ownership of his education. He probably won\u2019t, at first.

Teach him that after knowledge comes application and from application comes \"rewards\".\n\nI know I didn't understand that until my mid-20s and I certainly missed out on some opportunities. Unfortunately, education systems rarely integrate theory, application, and business. Since the schools aren't doing it, then it is the parents responsibility to make that connection for their children.\n\nSaid another way, a reward system should be based around the use of the knowledge gained. Doing so creates a full loop and fosters consistent behavior and learning.\n\nIf your child wants to become a software engineer, then he is in one of the best fields for early application. Software doesn't require large amounts of capital, just time and skill. If you have the money, then setting up a reward system for completed works is a good way to do it. E.g. $300 shoes for a complete and functioning mobile application, website, etc. and at least an attempt at testing real world viability. (It might sound like a lot, but a HS freshman is at the prime age for real-world application. There are plenty of high school age software engineers out there solving problems and, personally, I find this better than working a part-time \"starter\" job.)\n\nEDIT: To be clear, grades aren't the best thing to reward, since the grading system is shit outside of the education system.

There are studies where two seperate groups of kids are given a relatively enjoyable game. The first group gets a reward for playing and the second group just plays. Then after some time the reward is removed. The results are that the kids who were rewarded and then lost the reward started playing less compared with the other group when just objectively speaking they actually would have been enjoying themselves with the game if there hadn't been rewards to begin with.  \n\n\nRationalize that in whatever way you want so that it fits the reality all around you. If kids were paid money for grades always and constantly then I'm sure it would increase results but it would also be at the cost of creating people who just go through the motions and have no genuine curiosity or interest in what they are doing (which of course describes most people with their relationship to work).

No one is handing out prizes to adults for doing their jobs. \"Bonuses\" are rare, and kids should not have the expectation that normal behavior, like applying themselves in school, is rewarded. It sets people up for false expectations, in the same way fairy tales set little children up with false expectations. This world is HARD, harsh, and unrelenting. Motivation HAS to come from within because it is unlikely to come from outside. Period.", "Most of the work most people put into their work isn't to earn their current pay cheque, its to position themselves so they can get the next promotion or secure reliable work.  That's true from doctors to teachers, to police, to engineers to tradesmen to business owners and so on.\n\nThat's pretty damn similar to getting decent grades to secure your own furture employment.  As for wages, most of it is spent just living and kids get about as much benefit of that as parents do.", "If he rewards himself! EXACTLY my point.", "I think I\u2019ll offer him the shoes if he consistently gets better grades for another two semesters", "Why the sarcasm?", "> Really? You\u2019re privy to the grades of his classmates? Well I\u2019d love to hear them then\n\nClass statistics are available. The average is 3.5, and the average for people from my income group is 3.95, indicating the vast majority of them have straight As. And if he had that mindset that getting good grades isn\u2019t his top priority, then he\u2019s already failed. \n\nA punishment regardless.", "It\u2019s not average, because he doesn\u2019t have average resources to support him", "The US. And that\u2019s the average GPA in the country not the average GPA at an individual school, which will vary. I\u2019m using statistics from his school", "Why couldn\u2019t you get the grades he wanted?", "> Your answer for why he should be happy is also really ignoring what I said. You're asking him to be happy that he fed his dog, cleaned the bathroom, did laundry. If you expect it as a baseline, it is not something to be happy over. It is something to be average over. It is something normal, not something to be celebrated. So again, you have created a situation in which nothing is ever good, it is only normal or bad.\n\nThe issue with your logic here is that you\u2019re conflating an A with perfection. That\u2019s incorrect because an A is just being above 90%, which is still allows lots of room for error. If he gets above 95% in everything, then he has something to be happy about. \n\n> it's just something his brain isn't good at and tutoring isn't enough?\n\nIf he\u2019s intelligent enough, then that won\u2019t be an issue", "No, I believe in doing well for it\u2019s own sake. Doing things solely for a reward is a bad mindset. And I did take him to dinner", "Then that\u2019s a flawed system on the former\u2019s part", "Getting good grades when you\u2019ve been given every resource necessary too\u2014 he gets the clothes, gaming consoles, etc he wants within reason, as well  as tutoring, and so on\u2014 isn\u2019t unreasonable or pressure inducing. We cook for him, clean for him, give him 90% of what he wants, and all we ask for in return is good grades. That\u2019s not unreasonable", "When I responded I was referring specifically to the part where you said motivation has to come from within. For me, it doesn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t as a student and it doesn\u2019t now. As an adult, I look at my paycheck as external motivation to do a good job. The better I do, the bigger my paycheck via a raise or a bonus or whatever. That is the only reason I put in any sort of effort at my job. \n\nI can see your point though, I think we probably just approach the concept of motivation differently.", "Christopher Duntsch has entered the chat", "Cool. So, if you want above average performance, provide an above average reward.", "Neither did I. When I started failing to achieve A's as expected, I completely broke down. I found myself later unable to consider going back to finish college because the idea gives me anxiety attacks.", "Even if it's 3.5 you still expect 4.0, which is better than the average correct? Yet you don't want to reward it as it's better than average. This is how you get people who are incredibly amazing in their field and feel incompetent because they are top 3% instead of top 1% this is teaching them if they aren't the best they are failures.", "Then you're still ignoring basically every point I'm making, YTA for that alone.\n\nI'm not doing any logic exercise. I'm speaking from childhood experience with a mom like you. Being expected to get A's as a baseline destroyed my nerves, even though I almost always did it. It left me utterly unable to handle when I got to college and things worked differently and god forbid, I got a B.\n\nBad things can happen, things can just not work out through no fault of your son's. You need to be prepared for that and stop ignoring any suggestion that your kid won't end up with a perfect life because he got an A on a report card.", "Most of life is a grind.  Why not teach him to celebrate his wins?", "Also I was a \u2018gifted kid\u2019 as were many of my friends.   I had plenty of intrinsic motivation and drive.  It got pretty old getting told by my parents that my perfect grades were just expected. By the time they did decide that something was exceptional enough to really celebrate I no longer cared about their opinion.  I\u2019m not saying that you but just realize that just because your bar is high doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t celebrate your kids as they go.", "Absolutely fucking not. *You* decided to have sex and get pregnant and give birth to him, *you* decided he would require food and bare necessities, and *you* decided he would have to live in a world where good grades are a requirement to survive. Luxuries are a bonus but cooking for him and giving him bare necessities like food and clothing is not some kind of conditional transaction you put on your child for simple being born. In fact if you just buy him gaming consoles just because he wants them then what is stopping you from rewarding him when he gets good grades anyways?\n\nSecondly, if he gets bad grades then do you punish him in any way? Because if good grades are not rewarded then bad grades cannot be punished.", "You realize that when you\u2019re a trauma surgeon people literally do die if you\u2019re not perfect, right?", "Taking him out to dinner for doing his job as he should is the above average reward. The average reward would be nothing", "Taking him to a nice dinner for doing as expected, when the average reward would be nothing, is rewarding him better than average", "If it doesn\u2019t work out, it is his fault. It\u2019s that simple", "Or why couldn\u2019t you say - I\u2019ll put $100 for every perfect semester towards something you want?  Then he can either save up or have a $100 something for 15 weeks worth of work.  You sound like a hard ass for the sake of being a hard ass.", "I would celebrate him when he did something excellent, like getting all 95+ in his classes. Maybe I\u2019ll tell him I\u2019ll get him his shoes if that happens", "You can\u2019t reduce cooking whatever he likes whenever he wants and buying him brand name clothes. Those are luxuries, and they\u2019re predicated on the expectation he earns them by doing well. \n\nAnd no, not initially\u2014 we would talk to him to see what cold beer done to help him, and if after a semester he doesn\u2019t improve, then we punish him", "You do realize that a punishment  and a consequence are not the same thing, right? Somebody dying is a consequence of your lack of skill. Punishment would be losing your medical license.", "Guess what. He\u2019s NOT a surgeon. No kid needs to be perfect and you\u2019re lining him up for a lifetime of mental issues. Great parenting. And if you can\u2019t tell, since you seem so emotionally illiterate, that\u2019s sarcasm.", "Yes, I am clear that is your position. I am saying it is not correct.", "You may have rewarded your kid but in the end you ended up saying he didn't do anything special to get out of buying shoes.", "You rewarded him by taking him out and then basically telling him he did the bare minimum of expectations. You could have used it as a learning experience or a way to encourage long term grades, saying something like if you finished the year or something with straight As well do it, instead you took him out then when he asked said no this is actually the bare minimum when it clearly isn't.", "\u201cHe earns them by doing well\u201d so you are rewarding him for doing well then. What is the difference between him doing whatever he does to earn those and getting good grades?\n\nAnd again, you cannot punish him for bad grades if you\u2019re not rewarding him for good grades. You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too.", "What you\u2019re saying is the mindset of somebody who doesn\u2019t care about others. Disgusting.", "An A isn\u2019t perfection. An A is everything above 90%, just needing 90% leaves plenty of room for mistakes.", "Of course it\u2019s correct. He gets almost everything he wants, it\u2019s reasonable to expect As", "Because he pushed it instead of being grateful for the reward he got", "He asked to go to dinner, so we assumed that was over and done with once we did", "The difference is that he\u2019s not being rewarded for one period of good performance but rather for staying consistent. \n\nAnd yes I can. I\u2019m already doing it."]}
