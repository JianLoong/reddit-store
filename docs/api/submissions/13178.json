Your younger son is not your older son. You shouldn\u2019t expect them to be the same person or be motivated by the same thing.

A nice dinner out is good. Maybe every semester he gets mostly As he can pick the restaurant, but $300 shoes is a bit much.\n\nBut here is some food for thought: different kids have different priorities. Someone who wants to become a lawyer will care a lot more than someone who wants to become a carpenter. Also, school is harder for some kids than others. Maybe your older son got good grades without even trying, but the younger one worked really hard to get those good grades to make you proud. School isn't easy for everyone, so maybe he feels like he is being shut down by you and taken for granted. This is just one interpretation, but you might consider it.", "NTA\n\nHe may have friends who're being rewarded for good grades which has influenced him. I think a reward system for grades is more common than you think, even though I agree that it should be expected. When I finished secondary school it was almost common practice to you'd get a certain amount of money for every A on the transcript.", "NTA. I'm a teacher and there's a whole literature out there about rewards and motivations. The problem with having a direct, very explicit relationship between a grade and a reward is that the child can quickly internalize that the whole point of school is to get a reward. That's a bad idea because eventually the direct rewards won't be there and the kid might have no motivation to try. You want the child to want to learn and do well for the sake of learning and doing well. Kids who learn to do that are going to be successful in any circumstance.", "NAH. Sounds like normal family bickering.", "Info: If he had gotten straight Bs would you have given him a hard time about it?", "YTA for expecting straight As. Way to pressure your kid. Maybe set the expectation that they kid works hard and does his best?", "You're NTA. A $300 reward for doing his job in school is an insane request as far as I'm concerned. If denying this demand is \"cruel\" in his mind, he has a great life.", "NTA\n\nMaybe graduating with honors he can get rewarded, but for a transcript?  I don't think so.  A nice dinner out is fine.  $300 shoes?  Nope.", "NAH. But I will say, kids do deserve some appreciation for doing the work of getting good grades because it's not easy. We have a teen who had straight A's for five years, and we always got him a little something (tee shirt, fun variety of snacks, a game on Steam) as a little special surprise. Now that he's hit his super-hard sophomore year and struggling, honestly-- we are acknowledging and praising effort, not grades. I think you might want to talk to your son about ways he can earn money, because it sounds like he wants a bigger-ticket item. Does he have time to work after school/weekends? Or is his course load prohibitive of him using that time for working? Because if that's the case, you might want to rethink expectations.", "ESH\nSaying that straight As are just what is expected of being an asshole, demanding 300 bucks shoes is equally entitled and assholish.", "Soft YTA. I totally understand the desire to set your kid up for success, but as a person that was always expected to get good grades in school with little/no recognition, that shit sucked.  Sure the work may seem easy to adults, but at that age, it takes real, continuous effort and sacrifice. \n\nIt's unclear whether your son was demanding expensive shoes (in which case it's E S H) or just asking for them and using them as an example, but I assumed more asking based on the language you used. Regardless, it definitely seems like more discussion with your son should be had here. Perhaps he would have preferred the shoes to the dinner? Also, consider discussing what his close friends' families do to incentivize good academic performance, not to copy them but for context. I used to hear constantly how my friends would get $500 if their report card looked like mine.\n\nI get that putting in good effort now will ultimately help him in myriad ways, but teenagers generally don't have the perspective to understand how the decisions they make at that age impact their lives. It's important to be realistic about your expectations - \"good\" grades (and good enough grades to do well later in life) is a lot different than only A's.\n\nThere is also more to life than good grades and more to being a complete human than just being book smart. Instead of forcing your rubric for success on your child, maybe talk to them and learn what's important to them. Fovus on being an advocate and a collaborative problem solver for your child instead of an enforcer.\n\nIt's helpful to teach children that their time/effort/attention is a choice, and then help them make good choices about where to \"spend\" their efforts. What you practice grows stronger.", "NTA.  If that\u2019s his definition of cruel, he\u2019s in for a rough life.", "NAH I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an AH for asking. I also get high grades and I can understand wanting a reward or recognition for all the hard work that went into those grades. I do agree that $300 shoes seems wasteful. Maybe get him so candy or something.", "NTA. Telling a kid no because they want expensive shoes is not cruel.", "YTA, you aren't expecting good grades out of your kids. You're expecting perfection while also not wanting to admit that it's anything more than average. This is how you get extreme perfectionists with mental issues and can't function if they mess up.\n\nEdit; how bad is it If they get a B? Is it like you ground them or punish them and yell or is it like a hey do better next semester?", "ESH. Expecting good grades puts a LOT of undue pressure on young people. The expectation should be of their effort, not the result. If a kid tries their hardest and only gets a C, they shouldn\u2019t be punished. Their effort is the important thing. Not everyone will get an A+ result for A+ effort and that has to be OK. Do not tie up your child\u2019s worth (and self worth) with the result. \n\nHowever, your kid is coming off super entitled, demanding they be rewarded for the grades. If it\u2019s coming out of left field then you need to sit with your child and TALK to them. Why do they think that they should be getting a reward when that\u2019s not something you\u2019ve ever done? Do they have a friend who is rewarded for those things? Where is this new attitude coming from? \n\nAlso, your kids is old enough to get a job. Might be time to start having the conversation about making their own money. Big life lessons on what you *earn*.", "NTA \n\nYour son sounds very entitled.", "YTA for setting such a useless expectation. Your child's only expectation should be to try their best and make the most out of their life. Your child owes you nothing. \n\nAnd for comparing the two kids. They are two independent individuals with their own thoughts, ideas and life experiences.\n\nA teenager would pay you to not have to go out for dinner with you. Js.\n\nIf you think it's a big enough deal to attempt a reward with a meal, why not ask what your child would prefer?", "NTA. The reward will be the best colleges and jobs in the future. If he thinks he needs to be paid to do his best to get there. I feel sorry for him. All you can do is give him a foundation. The rest will be on him.", "NTA. Asking for $300 shoes for doing well in school is kinda crazy. Praise for a job well done makes people feel valued, but expecting to receive a pricey item for doing what's required of you is just a bad precedent. When he grows up, his boss will most likely not give him anything more than a \"good job,\" if that. My kids like pricey shoes as well, but we have an agreement that they pay for half. And grades don't count as money. They earn it by extra chores and helping out elderly family members with yard work or household chores they can no longer do themselves. I also found that they take care of their stuff better when they helped pay for it. They take more pride in the item as well.", "NTA and there's plenty of evidence that external rewards decrease intrinsic motivation. I'd have a good chat with him (maybe several) to clarify that good grades are something HE does for HIMSELF and his own future. That if he was or is struggling, you'll absolutely help, but this is about him and for him. \n\nBut I think you should also do some soul searching about why straight As are \"expected\" and how you'd feel and react if he weren't able to get those. Many wonderful people never got straight As. By definition, most people CAN'T get them because grades usually use a bell curve. \"Straight As are expected\" reads like \"All students should be above average\". And if you were a straight A student, you should see how nonsensical that is.  Does he know you love him unconditionally, whether he does well at school or struggles? Is he asking for a material present or is he asking you to be proud of him and love him? Is he using material gifts as a yardstick of love/pride because that's what you've taught him? These aren't rhetorical questions, I don't know the answers, but they're important to think about. Before you talk to him.", "NTA. My dad always told me \u201cyour grades are your pay\u201d \nIt made sense when I got older and realized my grades could get me into schools other when others grades may not get them into those same schools. \n\nOf course now colleges are ditching merit based applications so this may be outdated advice", "NTA - kids don\u2019t need to be rewarded for good grades or goals scored.", "NTA because of the price but I always got a few euro for each A.

Former teacher and current parent to teens here. Like others said, and you've pointed out, it's not a good precedent to reward grades with expensive rewards. Hold your ground and let him know you're proud of him for his good grades. Focus on his good work and keep your expectations reasonable. (By that I mean, it's reasonable to expect kids to get good grades if they're capable of them, but that doesn't necessarily mean perfect grades.) Show your love and pride with words.

YTA for setting the precedent of taking him out to dinner  for the good grades and having zero intention to do the same next time. That's setting your kid up to be disappointed and wonder why he's working so hard at all.

I was one of them, so I didn't expect my parents to reward me for it. What was there to reward, my genetics? I didn't have to try. If your son naturally finds school relatively easy, then there's nothing to reward, any more than you would reward him for breathing.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he was consistently staying up late to study, or doing a bunch of extra credit, or otherwise putting in real, hard work for classes he struggled with...I would consider giving him a nicer reward than just a dinner, as a symbol of being proud of his efforts. Maybe not $300 dollars, but something.\n\nAs a side note, is your son provided an allowance (if you can afford it)?

This pressure has been building and building over decades; each generation continues to be even more stressed about it than the one before. It\u2019s really difficult when the measure of your success is external and quantifiable. Someone else decides whether you succeeded or not (the teacher) and there is a number attached to tell you exactly how well or how poorly you did. Of course, this is just how grades work and I\u2019m def not suggesting we SHOULDN\u2019T give grades. They are necessary for the system we currently have. But it can create a real pressure cooker of a situation if kids aren\u2019t given the appropriate tools to handle it.\n\nTo say A\u2019s are the expectation is to say you expect perfection. An A is literally the highest grade he can get. And really, A\u2019s should NOT be the expectation.

Your expectations of him should be entirely about his behavior, and not his results.\n\nI also do not think you should buy him $300 shoes to reward him, and the dinner and congratulations you\u2019ve already given him are perfectly appropriate. The reward for education is the education itself. Kids think that idea is stupid, and most of them only try for good grades because they want external rewards and/or want to avoid punishments. But it really is true, and if you model the correct behavior a lot eventually, sometimes, they start to believe it. Tell him his reward for those grades is the information he learned that he can carry with him going forward. The foundation he is building that can help him be successful with whatever he wants to do in the future. The knowledge that when he sets his mind to something, he is capable of achieving it. Encourage him to take ownership of his education. He probably won\u2019t, at first.

Thats what A's are right? Excellence in any given subject? I mean C's are meant to be average, but this kids average is meant to be excellence all the time? That doesn't sound like much room for failure.", "Yes I just heard about this on Real Time with Bill Maher on last nights episode.  Not all I\u2019m sure,  but some colleges are now apparently just assigning slots based on lottery versus records, scores etc.", "The question isn\u2019t would, it is should \u2026 and it is not necessary.", "Not necessarily. Sometimes a person does need that acknowledgment that they are doing a good job and a person should celebrate their achievements. I was a straight A student since elementary school, the first time I got a B was my sophomore year of college. Even though I had good grades, my parents had your attitude of saying that it to be expected yet they would worship my brother\u2019s athletic achievements. I always felt like I was never good enough for them because they never gave me praise for my accomplishments.", "Having said that tho, why not offer him the shoes next semester instead of dinner.  If the prize you gave is worth more than the prize he wants, why not offer a reward he is fully invested in?\n\nSaying you spent more on his dinner makes you more dickish, not less.", "There was a reward: a nice dinner.\nI used to get good grades, now I don't. I also used to have a lot more motivation than I have now, but to blame \"not getting rewards\" is stupid. The good grade itself is the reward, isn' it? It's wrong to \"expect\" good grades, but it's also wrong to just... not get good grades because you don't get material rewards???", "Yeah, I was thinking maybe it comes from peer pressure", "Why do you think so?", "Right? Who knew?", "Eh. Works both ways. They shouldnt expect all As (which, as a university student myself is very hard to pull off) same way he shouldnt expect $300 shoes. So ESH", "This\nWhat is an accomplishment will differ from kid to kid and subject to subject and topic to topic. But when parents just consider As acceptable, this creates immense pressure on sucks the joy out of learning. My parents were like you. We have a 15 points system. One day in high school I came home with 13. Best grade in the whole year in a damn difficult exam. I was so proud of myself. My mother's reaction was to ask why I only got 13, what happened to 15? That hurt so much, it keeps hurting 25 years later.", "This. \ud83d\udcafthjs all the way. As being the expectation, meaning perfection screwed me up for a very long time.  No he doesn\u2019t need $300 shoes, what he does need is positive reinforcement and not the anxiety of perfection. The burnt out gifted kid road is real and sucks", "Yeah, what I\u2019ve gotten from the comments is it\u2019s less about what I get than showing appreciation for him, so I\u2019ll try that approach", "Yeah, toxic productivity is a real thing, but don't expect to get upvotes for mentioning it", "Thank you for pointing this out. No one seems to pick up on the fact that A's are far above average so how can that be the baseline all the time? There's no room for error.", "Definitely. But the question is what do I say to him.", "Several Law schools are now dropping the LSAT exam from the admissions requirements. I\u2019ve heard of a lot of colleges that don\u2019t require the SAT or ACT to apply. Makes zero sense at all. There\u2019s no way to account for the various differences in curriculum across a multitude of school systems without a single standardized test everyone is equally subjected to. An exam to determine what you know is not an unreasonable way to determine whether you should have a spot reserved for you when you voluntarily ask to go to a school.", "So praise him more?", "It sounds like he doesn\u2019t feel appreciated.", "I think that is a good approach. No matter how old children get, they still care if their parents are proud of them. Its important to let your son know, even if it\u2019s just with words, that you are as proud of his consistent academic efforts as you of new achievements.", "It\u2019s not you my older child was never entitled my younger one is there\u2019s an eight year age difference I haven\u2019t raised them differently. I just think it\u2019s the way things are now.", "Yeah", "Yes. A lot of people will criticise you for having such high expectations and putting pressure on your son. Personally I think that high expectations are fine as long as they come with high support levels. And that includes making sure he knows you love him whatever (you do, don't you..?) and are proud of his efforts.", "Possibly", "Thanks for the advice, I can do that", "I mean, you\u2019re complaining about him on Reddit.", "That\u2019s good. Talk to him because he probably feels unappreciated.", "fair point", "I will"]}
