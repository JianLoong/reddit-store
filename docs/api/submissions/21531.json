Since June 2018 he has not had anything to do with our children, which started as a \"punishment\" to me because he was pissed that the kids outgrew clothing that his GF bought them during Christmas (he said I was lying about the clothing- it was utterly stupid).

I don't have him on FB. The posts were screen-shotted and sent to me. Now.. my brother has always been close to my ex. Even back when I was with my ex, there wasn't a single day when my brother wasn't at my house hanging out with my ex. My brother is a few years you get than us and he, unfortunately, looked up to my ex because my ex smoked him up all the time and became a friend, when my brother had no one. \n\nAnywho, because of how close my brother is to my ex still to this day, he fully believes I'm keeping my kids from my ex.

Those kids need their dad.\" This has included my brother covering for my ex and refusing to give his home address so I could have him served paperwork for CS and visitation through the court. So this morning I happened to run in to my brother and once again, he brings up my kids not seeing their father and says that it's \"fucked up\" and that I should be proving to my ex that I want him to be a part of our kids lives (?). So I basically told him if he kept hanging out with that kid that we would go completely no contact with him and he would essentially be dead to us. This bothered him a great deal because he is very close with my oldest son (12) and they hang out a lot (fishing, video games, etc).

Why on earth ***should*** he be allowed around your children if he's going to fill their heads with lies, about how you won't let him see their father? Why are you allowing your son to go fishing with him and other things unsupervised, given that he's so close with your ex? I wouldn't trust your brother with unsupervised visits.\n\nPersonally, I'd link your brother to this post.

My sister is divorced and her ex refuses to do his part for my niece. Your brother is completely out of line. The way I see it your ex cut off all relationship with you, your kids and your family.\n\nYour brother chosing your ex instead of sticking up for you, supporting you is a major red flag. It also gives me the impression that your relationship with your brother is not all that great. That makes me wonder what your ex and your brother talks about. Your ex has indirect access to you and your personal life through your brother and sadly either your brother changes side or you keep him at a distance.\n\nI am sorry to say but your brother cannot be trusted. You should keep your personal life private and limit anyting form being leaked. Your brother and your ex can use it against you in the future.\n\nLastly you may not know your ex's address but your brother does. If I am not mistaken you should be able to serve your ex Child Support papers by  \u201cservice by publication\u201d or \u201cservice by posting\u201d. Or maybe the courts can serve your ex.

What are you waiting for?", "NTA of course. Ex is a deadbeat and brother is immature and impressionable. Both drag you down.\n\nOnly problem here is that by threatening to cut off your brother, *in his mind* - it is the same as \"what you did to your ex\". The reality is that you aren't as concerned about your brother hanging out with your ex, that's a symptom. You're concerned about your brother being an A H to you. Totally legit reason to push him away on its own. Maybe he needs to understand this.", "NTA, you should have already cut him off, he\u2018s already proven you mean nothing to him.", "NTA - your brother needs to accept reality in this situation. He is accepting a deadbeat liar over you despite the evidence. \n\nHe has already chosen someone else over family - you are just helping him make it official.", "NTA", "NTA - he doesn't want to understand the easy way with facts you show him, maybe he will the hard way. At minimum he should just shut up and stop pestering you about it every time you see him.", "NTA, why doesn\u2019t he take a small chunk of that energy he\u2019s so aggressively giving you and ask his friend exactly what he is doing to try and see his kids.", "NTA even if the situation didn't include kids, requesting your siblings or close friends not to stay close with your ex if they plan on staying close with you is not crazy thing to do.", "ESH:   I would be 100% with you if you said \"If you continue to bring this up and put yourself in the middle of this I will go no contact\"  \n\nBut to say he has to choose between you and him unless you're going to take your cjildren away is manipulative and you know it will hurt your children.  \n\nAgain him getting in the middle is wrong.
