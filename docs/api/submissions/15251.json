If you were getting tattoos to commemorate a friendship, you'd have equal say what to get. If one didn't like a suggestion you'd move on.

Fine for something temporary, this is not temporary.\n\nYou'd maybe be the asshole if she wanted something like Henna (non-offensive and in a position you could reasonably obscure) that'd be gone in a few months, but as it stands she is definitely the asshole for being so entitled and self-absorbed.", "INFO: is a hen night the equivalent to a bachelorette party?
