They could even order custom ones.", "What are they thinking really? Its fine that she wants a tattoo, its okay to suggest that the others get one as well but not taking no an answer sucks. NTA.", "The demand for permanently marking someone else's body is wild to me!  What a crazy ask of anyone!", "\u201cNo\u201d is a full sentence on this one.", "If people are turning on me for not wanting to get a tattoo then our friendship isn't strong enough for me to want to get a tattoo of you or your choice lol.", "Agreed and she absolutely does not get to decide WHAT you get tattooed", "A wacky jury to judge a goofy idea.\n\nImagine if they called off the engagement, hope they like long sleeve shirts.", "Right? Like I'm sorry, I'm not getting a tattoo to honor a friend's bachelorette party. Even if I think it's the best relationship ever, even if it's a great friend, that's just not something I care enough about to put on MY body forever.", "OP should make sure they are not allergic to henna before suggesting that.\n\nAlso look up who is doing it since there is lots of horror story of people mixing henna with other cheaper stuff.\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/black-henna-dangers-risk-scarring-warning-tattoo-temporary-chemical-burn-a8451756.html", "\"Why not get semi permanent tats and look what holds longer: the engagement or the tats?\" \ud83e\udd2a", "Absolutely. Henna for example, would be a great option.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t care how stable and lengthy the relationship, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m getting a permanent tattoo to commemorate someone else\u2019s party, and I love tattoos.  That\u2019s just ridiculous", "I would probably pay for my wedding party to all get a small tattoo OF THEIR CHOICE if they wanted one. But i wouldn\u2019t be making people get something they don\u2019t want.", "This is so insightful, I think you hit the nail on the head about the friend's insecurity and immaturity.", "I don't think you're boring, I think you're the only one with any sense in this situation. And at this age?? I don't understand why you would want to surround yourself with people who make you feel like the bad guy for not changing your body on a whim. Why would you need a permanent reminder of the fact that you and your friends got shitfaced to celebrate this marriage? It's not even a friendship tattoo, it's for a glorified bar crawl.", "Oh I hadn\u2019t even thought of Henna, but that is another good idea, if as you suggested they aren\u2019t allergic and it\u2019s a reputable source.", "Eh, it can be, once you have a number of tattoos, they don\u2019t need to be that deep.  I\u2019ve definitely gone to tattoo conventions and decided on the spot I want a design, just because I loved the art and wanted it on me.  That said, I would still NEVER be willing to get a tattoo celebrating someone else\u2019s party, that\u2019s just beyond ridiculous.", "Now THIS is a good idea!"]}
