If it's that important to them, offer to accept a temporary tattoo of their design.", "op=NTA\n\nTell her you'll get a henna tattoo but that is YOUR LIMIT.  (they last about 2 weeks).\n\nI wouldn't get a tattoo to commemorate ANYONE'S ELSE'S ANYTHING.  Only those things I would want to commemorate(my wedding, my child's birth, etc).", "I think your friend may have some issues around 'judgement'.  \n\nBecoming engaged to someone she has hardly had any time to get to know and them asking that friends permanently scar their bodies to celebrate the engagement!\n\nThat would be a 'hard no' from me and I wouldn't shirk from telling her so.", "Some things... most things... make better t-shirts than tattoos.

My best friend is engaged to a guy she\u2019s been with for over 5 years. I\u2019m still not gonna get a tattoo to commemorate her bachelorette party. Do you know how many I\u2019ve been to and will go to? My body isn\u2019t a scrapbook for bachelorette parties. That isn\u2019t a thing. Why is everyone else going along with this?", ">When I said no she got arsey with me and demanded to know why. I didn\u2019t want to say of course which annoyed her even more\n\nJust say you don't want to get a fucking tattoo.\n\n\"Why? Because i don't want it, that\u2019s why, i don't have to give you some incredibly detailed reason, i don't want it is enough\".\n\n> really don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole but the rest of the party have been making comments also,\n\nGOOD LUCK on the trip with those idiots......You'll need it.\n\nNTA", "Is she 15?

End of story", "Hen night?", "NTA\n\n\"I said no\"\n\nLet's cut out all the flavor text. Without the rest of the story This sentence alone should've been enough as is. What willy wanka wacko world does this chick live in where she wants to force her friend to get a tattoo? What  idiot gets mad when someone gets mad at someone for not Putting permanent ink on their body? What desperate idiot constantly gets engaged(this time after four months) just for it to fail an expect people to scar their body for them?. The common denominator is the word \"idiot\" which this wack job of a friend is.", "Even if these two engaged individuals were perfect in every way for each other, had an obviously and observably strong bond, built a wholesome life together.... Why the fuck would anyone who is NOT a member of the couple get a tattoo to commemorate a weekend celebrating a relationship (read: wedding, really) they aren't a main character of???", "Amazing! I\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve found someone with a similar experience (also glad you didn\u2019t get the tattoo)", "Forgot the \u201c/s\u201d there, right?", "Exactly, if she\u2019s hell bent on people having tattoos she needs to order some temporary ones", "The kind of stick on ones? The \u201csemipermanent\u201d ones with a tattoo gun often don\u2019t fade and should be considered permanent", "Are they all going to do this for all of their hen nights? Are your bodies just going to be covered in hen night tattoos?", "Me too! Definitely make your own decisions for your body and give the middle finger to anyone who says otherwise!", "Ah ok", "I've been married for 42 years and still would never tattoo his name on me.

And I wanted to have another tattoo I did myself!\u201d", "I mean, you totally should text it anyways! Just to see what the response is. Lol", "Same.", "Honey? Is that you?", "Also would get that tattoo. But I also just told my artist I thought skeleton hands holding hot wings would be the best lower back tattoo ever, so my judgment is suspect. Oh and OP - totally NTA", "LOL He\u2019d think I\u2019d lost my mind. I\u2019ll do it!", "Yeah definitely NTA. But imma say don\u2019t do hot wings do ribs\u2026. It\u2019s \u201cbaby\u2019s back\u201dribs ;) \u2026.

Just like you don\u2019t need a \u201cgood reason\u201d for not wanting to drink someone else pee\n\nNTA", "NTA-I love my tattoos or I wouldn\u2019t have them. I love doing things with friends and commemorating what we do is fun but I\u2019d never ask nor expect someone to get a tattoo with me.", "NTA.  Tattoos are permanent and highly personal.  The only person who gets a yes vote in that circumstance is you.", "Um, it\u2019s your body you don\u2019t have to give anyone a reason why you don\u2019t want to tattoo it.", "NTA, and you don\u2019t need to (and probably shouldn\u2019t) get in to your feelings about the engagement.

Who cares if she's getting married.", "NTA I vote you decline the invite for hen night, instead of going and being pressured to get a bad tattoo you don\u2019t want, all night long.", "Ignoring all the details, a tattoo is permanent and is a personal choose. Don\u2019t be pressured into such a decision", "Nope your body your choice", "Fuck no! That\u2019s permanent. No to a spontaneous tattoo should be enough.

Don't tattoo anything you don't want to.", "NTA. Brides have gone too far!! Now they\u2019re demanding to tattoo their wedding party?! COME ON.", "NTA I have two different matching tats. One I got with my sister and one I got with my kid. I would not get one for that reason even if they had been together for years! The absolute gall to even ask and then pitch a fit when you said no! For me, my tattoos are very personal and have meaning.", "NTA. Even if the engagement could fail, you shouldn't be forced to get a tattoo of any kind on you. It's your body, not your friend's. And from what I'm aware of, tattoo removals are expensive; if the engagement fails, or they get married and then file for divorce, I highly doubt she's going to pay for everyone's tattoo removals.", "What kind of self absorbed narcissistic bull shite is this that she want all of you to permanently mark your bodies with her engagement memories. \n\nWtf \n\nNTA \n\nRun, she is not your friend.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. Pressuring someone to participate in group tattoos is childish, at best. Frankly, fuck anyone who doesn't grasp that very simple concept.", "This. She wants you to wear a dumb shirt or a hat or a sash or whatever, sure, but a TATTOO? NO.\n\nThat is a permanent mark on your body that has no meaning to you and only to her. Regardless of the engagement situation and history, that is FAR too much to ask of even your partner, let alone a friend.\n\nShe's being ridiculous, you are NTA and if she's going to go off on you for not wanting to get matching tattoos, then she needs to check her priorities.", "We always tend to doubt ourselves in these weird situations. I'd rather someone ask and get an overwhelming response, than not ask and end up pressured to do something they don't want to do. Good luck with your \"friend\". \u2764\ufe0f", "This is as far as any rational human would go/expect her friends to go. And honestly anything that would outlive the weekend would be an offer, not a demand.", "From what it sounds like, a semi permanent tattoo may last longer than the engagement", "Since the writing of OP is kinda british, the tattoo should be of a head of lettuce.", "rendered in the style of a Medieval manuscript illumination!"]}
