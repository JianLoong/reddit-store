Just\u2026wow.", "NTA - I don't care if this guy is the love of her life and she can guarantee that they will be together and in love for eternity - it is still idiotic and beyond entitled to ask people to get a permanent body modification to commemorate your hen party.", "NTA. You get t-shirts or some kind of jewerly. Heck, even a cup engraved with the date. Demanding  someone to get a tattoo is too much.", "Nta. She doesn\u2019t get to decide what or when or even if you get a tattoo", "NTA. The reasoning doesn\u2019t even matter. It\u2019s your body - if you don\u2019t want said tattoo, you shouldn\u2019t get it. If you\u2019re into getting a tattoo, just not the tacky version, I suppose you could get a \u201ccustom\u201d version of it done, but you should really do what you want because you\u2019re the one who\u2019ll have to look at it the rest of your life.", "NTA\u2026demanding that you get a tattoo to commemorate a party weekend is asinine. Your body, your choice, full stop.

Tell your friend you have no intention of changing anything about your body for her or anyone else.\n\nDefinitely NTA!!!!!", "NTA! Nobody has the right to demand you get a tattoo. It is YOUR BODY!

I\u2019m someone who has tattoos but I\u2019d never get a tattoo celebrating someone else\u2019s hen night.

How solid the relationship is really isn't relevant to the question.\n\nYou are NEVER TA for setting boundaries regarding your own body, so NTA.\n\nShe and your other \"friends\" are definitely AH for even thinking that it's ok to demand that someone else undergo a procedure that carries risk (and yes, there are real infection risks with tattoos) and permanently changes their body.  And that's true whether you have no tattoos or 40 others already.", "NTA and you should definitely not go because it sounds like if you get drunk they might try to get you tattooed while you\u2019re out of it.
