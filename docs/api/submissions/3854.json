As in no home, no friends, the closest people left are other druggies who immediately bail when you OD to avoid trouble for themselves.

CPS will give her a chance to kick him out but they will act if he is deemed dangrous to be around or living with.", "OP=NTA\n\nshe's allowing him to steal from you.  That would make me move alone. \n\nBut she's the absolute A-H for letting him steal her child's meds.  For letting him do drugs around children.  to likely let her kid go hungry(if little food in house).  \n\nJust that he does illegal drugs in the house could get her house taken if this is the US.  It's a type of RICO law.  IE a man lost his house because his son did weed(before it was generally legal) in the house.", "NTA", "Report the thefts to the police and say you suspect your sister\u2019s boy friend as none of the stuff started missing until he showed up.  Either they charge him or they don\u2019t, but at least you would have tried.", "Who cares if she hates OP? A child is in danger and needs protection, OP has a societal obligation to report it and do their best to protect the child", "Your sister needs to \u201clove\u201d her kid more than this man. Everything, even your own wants and needs, comes secondary to taking care of your children. If she\u2019s willing to risk a stable home for her kids because she wants this man, she isn\u2019t much better than him.", "I guess the real question is what is rock bottom for your sister?\n\nShe and 14 yr old daughter homeless?\n\nthe 14 yr old taking drugs, because it's been normalized(and/or because she's not getting her proper meds so she begins to self-medicate?)  Will the 14 yr old have to OD before your sister sees the huge error of her ways?", "Probably because of the proposed contradiction between her hating you and the problem being fixed. Both of those things can be true at once. Also people probably disagree with listing her feelings as an important factor to consider, when there is a child in danger while that man lives in the house. If her mother is irresponsible enough to neglect her child like that, her feelings don't matter\n\nAlso, downvoting something means you disagree with it. Taking downvotes that personally will also get you downvoted", "NTA. You aren't making your sister decide between these. You're telling her that *you* will not continue living with a drug addict. So one of you will need to move out, and you're giving her a heads up.", "For some rock bottom isn't until death unfortunately", "It wasn't my comment being downvoted. I was confused as to why someone else was being downvoted for agreeing with the basic conclusion and saying, \"don't forget xyz.\"\n\nBut sincerely, thanks for sharing your guess.", "NTA and move out yesterday.", "But even being with him she is desperate and alone cuz he doesn't do ANYTHING shes not happy wtf", "That's not love. Sometimes tough love is needed. Right now you're enabling the both of them...very common with addicts (them being enabled that is and tiur sister is addicted to him). And no amount of talking or pleading will make any changes. Addicts won't quit unless they want to. My ex was an alcoholic (but at least an upstanding and working citizen) so I've dealt with addiction. If he's OD'd and that didn't change anything he won't hit rock bottom until he's dead probably. You have zero control over what they do. You only have control over yourself. So you need to quit enabling them and the only way to do that is to move out and let them fend for themselves. I agree you need to get CPS involved and if you know he's taking nieces Adderall then that needs to be reported as well.\nIf you stay you will get dragged down with them both financially and mentally. Save yourself  (and report them to save your niece) because you can't save them if they don't want to be saved.", "you are not an AH. your sister needs a wake up call! a serious one.", "you know what can happen with a Child in those situatons?\nyou know how many creeps are there?\n\nsorry but drug addict can sell his own kid for a high"]}
