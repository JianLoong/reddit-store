Did he know about this purchase before you made it? It sounds like it was expensive and if he wasn\u2019t consulted I can understand some frustration on his part. He could also be dealing with the emotional fallout of what I\u2019m sure had been a very tough battle for you guys.

The biggest concern of wearing it elsewhere is catching the eye of someone who would do her harm.  Other concerns include other kids bullying her (there are kids who would do that, like it or not) and the outfit getting ruined.  Those are three that come to mind, and I'm sure there are other things that could happen that would spoil things for the girl.\n\nPoint is, instead of just shrugging concerns off as though they aren't real possibilities, actually consider the fact that they are indeed real possibilities.  Given the circumstances, this girl deserves some happiness, so being a little extra cautious wouldn't be a bad thing.\n\nNot sure why people are against the little girl getting to enjoy her childhood, but it's disturbing to be honest.", "Who said that the real world was filled with nothing but pretty flowers?

Well obviously they do, even if only a little bit.\n\nWas the daughter robbed of her childhood?  Some of it, yes, indeed.\n\nDoes the daughter deserve to be tossed out onto the streets to play without any concern for her safety or well being?  No, absolutely not!  (I don't mean kicked out of her home, but rather just let loose as though she's a normal 12 yr old girl.)  Because of what she went through, she's been robbed of at least part of her childhood and deserves to enjoy what little she has left of it without suffering some other event that will possibly ruin it.\n\nThink beyond the moment, then ask yourself, who has no idea what they are talking about?\n\nI got a scare when I was 16 because my mother got diagnosed with cancer.  Thankfully she beat it.  But the scare was real.  My father was out of the picture (he was a real piece of work), so I would essentially have been an orphan (not literally, just \"for all intents and purposes\").  That was merely a scare for me and I still remember how it felt.  I can't even begin to imagine what OP's daughter went through, but I do know that she deserves to enjoy her childhood as much as possible, and extra effort should be put in to make sure she doesn't get cheated out of any more of it.\n\nIf you want to speak solely on the outfit and how it's perfectly safe for her to wear out in public, then please consider the case of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey.  Whether or not her dressing up was connected to what happened to her being set aside, her disappearance opened up the eyes of many on the child beauty pageants that were disturbingly popular.  Like it or not, there are guys that enjoy such things, and for the wrong reasons.  I consider risks and try to think about safety, so stop hating on me for caring."]}
