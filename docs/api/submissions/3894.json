Please pass this on to your sister: With children's hospitals running out of rooms due to RSV, this was completely irresponsible behavior from Cindy.  She has no regard for her OWN CHILDREN, much less yours.  This woman is not a friend, she's a complete & utter AH.  And no, the bandaid on the kid's bottom was not from a \"game\", you literally saw the injection site.  This should be the end of babysitting for this AH, right now, full stop, and end this \"friendship\".  I'm not a religious person at all, but I'm praying hard that your little one doesn't get sick & is able to make the surgery consult.", "NTA. Parents have been known to lie to childcare providers about how sick their kids are. And if that's a \"game,\" she should be reported for child abuse. No \"game\" involves sticking a needle in your child.", "NTA and demand to know what that kid has bc she put your child at risk. I would also never do anything for her ever again.", "NTA. This woman doesn\u2019t give a damn about you or your kids.", "NTA. Your sister was lied to, stiffed and everyone but especially her kids were put at risk because her \"Friend\" cared more about whatever tf thing she was doing than being upfront and honest. Your sister needs to tell Cindy to find a new babysitter because this won't be the last time she pulls this type of shit.", "NTA\n\nI would not babysit for Cindy ever again.", "Deff nta\n\nNo one needs to justify not wanting to do something. \n\nThe friend imo lied. If it was one thing i would giver the friend the benefit of a doubt. But she lied about what time she would drop them off, what time she would puck them up. On top of that if her kids are sick thats reason enought. Your sis has 2 obligations and that is to her own kids. \n\nThe friend is a user. She uses people. I bet she is manipulative and takes advantage of your sis. It is commong in people like her.", "NTA.  She left sick kids with you.  My SIL did that to me - my son was 5 weeks old.

You have to put the health of your children first. You wouldn\u2019t have been the AH if you had turned her away and refused to babysit while they were sick.

It's time to send her a message telling her after this stunt, not paying you the amount agreed, how she disregarded your time, how she clearly lied AND brought seriously ill children into your home, you will no longer babysit for her.

There's no way I'd ever watch her kids again and I'd probably tell her why then block her number. You would have been perfectly within your rights to tell her to take her kids home when she brought them over.", "NTA \n\nShe lied to you, dropped off sick kids, came early to drop them off and stayed later and paid you less!\n\nThat\u2019s a hell no on ever babysitting again!", "NTA.\n\nLying about her kids being healthy is not cool, especially if she knew about your daughters consultation.

She handed me $44 in cash and said that was all she had.\n\nNope. Apart from that she should pay you by hour and not random rates, she also showed up 1.30 hour later than agreed upon. She cannot just decide that on her own. I know child minder here charge per minute for overtime...\n\nDefinitely do not babysit for her again, unless you desperately need the money. Than make sure you tell her the hourly rate and the surcharge for being late.\n\nBTW you're never obliged to babysit others people kids if you're not comfortable with it.", "NTA. It sounds like you are in a tough situation. Your friend Cindy was not being truthful with you about the health of her children, and it put your own child's health at risk. It is understandable that you would be upset and want to protect your own children. However, it is also important to consider how your actions might affect your relationship with Cindy. Refusing to babysit for her again may be justified, but it could also cause conflict and strain your friendship. It is up to you to decide what is best for your situation.", "NTA. This story sucks and I'm sorry for you. As parents we have to decide this shit all the time with sick kids. She knew what she was doing. What an AH", "NTA. There are multiple layers of lies from Cindy here. Total AH moves from her. Even if you take out the health ones, she still lied about the basic details of the transaction, too (the time and payment) so even approaching this from a cold business viewpoint is bad for her.\n\nThere is absolutely no way to view this other than your sister is completely in the clear and Cindy pulled a major AH move. She should not sit for Cindy again.", "I wonder why this child would have been given a shot in his butt. Injections in kids are never given in the butt, they would be either in their upper arm or thigh.", "Yeah, that really stuck out as a WTF to me too.", "NTA. This is point is very important! Especially with an upcoming surgery consult. It can give you an idea of how long the illness might take before presenting. Nothings worse than having to reschedule a surgery you\u2019re already nervous about. \n\nPlease, find a way to ask her exactly what was diagnosed before letting her know you won\u2019t be babysitting again. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be easy but if she\u2019s any friend at all, she\u2019ll come clean!\n\nOh! And good luck with the upcoming surgery! I truly hope it is nothing serious!", "even if the kid\u2019s arm and thigh were not good options, the shot would\u2019ve been on the side of their butt and not their butt itself. there\u2019s something weird about this.", "I thought the same.
