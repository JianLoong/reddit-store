Their relationship is very rushed, only knowing each other for a year. John and I are part of a friendship group of 6, we all met in University. This is the friend group I persuaded not to go, although persuaded is harsh in my eyes.\n\nThe reason I am not going is because Lindsay was the reason my brother got fired from his job. This happened a year ago when my brother worked in an accounting firm after he graduated. He was 22 and Lindsay was 29. There was harassment from her and my brother was uncomfortable but didn't know what to do. He eventually reported her and instead of letting Lindsay go, they let my brother go instead. Shortly after that, she met John.\n\nI only found this out when I was talking with my brother about the wedding and showed him a photo of John and Lindsay together and he told me that Lindsay was who he was talking about when he got fired. I thought it was disgusting behaviour and told John so and declined to go to the wedding. He thinks that I'm only hearing one side and that I should reconsider. My chat with John all happened in private texts between us.\n\nI guess John was venting to our friends because I was getting tons of grief from our friends as well as some of Lindsay friends who I happen to know. At first, I gave vague reasons for why I wasn't going but they weren't good enough and people felt I could just get out of them so I added everyone who messaged me to a private group chat and posted screenshots of a conversation John and I had about my brother's situation as well as messages my brother had sent to me about it (I had his permission to do this) and left it at that. Pretty quickly, our friends all decided to not to go and let me know how sorry they were for my brother and didn't know Lindsay was like that.\n\nLindsay messaged me and called me spiteful. Said I was \"persuading\" our friends not to go because of this one incident with my brother and it happened ages ago and it was none of my business. Also that it was rude of me and I was a bad friend to share a private text conversations with everyone. I couldn't care less and both she and John are out of my life for how cavalier they are about harassment in the workplace. She's also being shady on Instagram, saying she can't want to celebrate with only her friends because John's friends don't want to see him happy.\n\nWas I an AH? I think that I didn't persuade anyone and that it's a perfectly reasonable reason not to go.\n\nETA - Lindsay singled my brother out as her next prodigy, got close to him where they stayed late and work and did things outside of work together. Lindsay initiated a relationship, brother tried to back out, saddled him with more and more work until he reported and got fired.\n\nLindsay admitted it to John and they both agree my brother put himself at fault and was lazy for not keeping up\n\nETA - The underwraps relationship was of a sexual nature, they would hook up", "created_utc": 1687815155, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jtznk/aita_for_persuading_my_friend_group_not_to_attend/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah sorry but that's spiteful behavior considering you've not even bothered to ask about the other side of the original conflict. Most businesses aren't going to risk a wrongful termination suit to prop up a harassing employee, which should tell you something about this one sided crusade you're on.", "YTA\n\nA year isn't that short of time. Many successful marriages have similar dating periods. Its more that recent generations have changed that paradigm. \n\nYou are taking your brother's side, which is reasonable but also carries risk in that you don't really know what happened. You have his side of the story and are making assumptions that the company sided with her for some corrupt reason. John even said that you have a one sided view. \n\nThen you air everything out in a group chat, sharing private messages between you and John?  You don't owe people an answer, just make an excuse like 99% of the population would or say you don't want to talk about something you don't have the full story on. Some friend you are to John. Maybe you have more that convinced all your friends, but the way you wrote it makes it seem like you don't have all the facts.", "YTA. You did persuade the friend group. You told them your reason and provided one sided evidence. You should have kept your mouth shut and not gone.", "ESH. You should've stood your ground for not telling anyone why you weren't going, and not brought out dirty laundry for everyone to see. If Lindsay is like this, it won't take long for everyone to see her for who she really is.", "YTA. You have a private grievance with Lindsay for a story you only know half of. You had no right to share private text messages with John to the group. Your friends are AHs as well if they are talking your second hand account as fact.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to read this, and for you not a single time, try to have a 1 on 1 conversation with Lindsay. Ever heard the saying \u201cThere\u2019s 2 sides to every story\u201d? \n\nAdditionally, John did exactly what any man should do in his position and defend his future wife. She is now more important than you, than your friends, than anyone else.\n\nIf you respected your friend John as much as you made it out how close y\u2019all were before this, than you should have told him you need to hear her side before making judgement. Which, if we are all honest here, all you did was judge her before hearing her side. You played he said she said about this. That never ends well. Maybe all parties are better off cutting ties.", "There are 2 sides to every story and in between there lies the truth. I think that OP had every right to not attend, but not so sure that you should have shared that  information with the rest of your group? So NTA for not going but YTA for sharing.", "Exactly, it's so fucked up. It's all about money.\n\nI don't know what's up with John, it's like she's blinded him. If my partner was guilty of sexual harassment (especially with someone so much younger) and they admitted it, they would be gone out of my life so fast. The ring would be off my finger immediately. It's disgusting", "I'm unsure what mine and Lindsay's friends are doing about but mine and John's friends have all decided not to go. I'm thankful I've got great friends.", "Probably. Someone who can do that would have no issues with cheating", "She is way older, is in a capacity to assign him work, and she chose to start a secret relationship with him. \n\nShe is definitely the AH", "I put it in another reply but basically that she treated him as her next prodigy when they were in training and she took him out for drinks and had a close work relationship. He went with it to progress faster but she asked for an underwraps one and then piled him with more and more work and halted his progression until he reported and got fired.\n\nShe admits it happened but blames my brother and John agrees with her, says my brother was just lazy and it's his fault.", "Our texts about his workplace involved a lot of him saying his new boss was really nice (Lindsay). She would treat my brother as her next prodigy out of the group of employees she had to train up and would often stay with him after work and they would go for drinks because he wanted to progress quickly and he thought by building a good rapport that it would help. Lindsay initiated an underwraps relationship and he went with it. Later he didn't feel good about it so she would pile him on with more and more work and kept halting back his review, kept texting him outside of hours and he was exhausted and uncomfortable. I did sort of encourage him to ask HR and not to name names, but he got fired for because he participated.\n\nAll of this spanned over 9 months so I don't think my brother was lying and he was very excited for his first proper graduate level job", "What details do you need? I can try provide them", "I was talking with John about it and she admitted it (if you actually read my post). They don't think it's a big deal.", "Lots of places prop up people who harass others.  Particularly in Academia.  I even got told by HR that my previous boss had been spoken to before and had to undergo training because she harassed her previous admin to the point they had a panic attack.\n\nThe options HR gave me were having another talk with her.  Oh yay please do because it worked so well the first time, and she's totally not going to take it out on me right?\n\nOr find another job. Bottom line the big donors loved her.  She brought in a lot of money to the dept and so no way would they entertain getting rid of her.\n\nI'm thankfully now in a dept with wonderful people who don't gaslight me and who are actually talking about fast tracking me they are so impressed with my level of work.  My new job (that old boss said I was told inexperienced to handle) is a promotion.  I make 15k more and I'm 100% wfh.\n\nMeanwhile my old boss is a dept chair, but she hasn't been able to keep an assistant since I left.  Her current one was only on the job 2 months before going out on medical leave and it wouldn't surprise me if she doesn't return from it.", "Personally to me, a year is rushed to start dating, move in and get married. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, just thats my opinion.\n\nI am taking my brother's side yes. Our texts about the workplace spanned a long time and if he was lying, they wouldn't have. He worked hard to land that job and was very excited to get started. \n\nYes I did air it out. I got tired of having 8 different conversations about it. I tried everything. I said that I had another wedding to go, that I couldn't guarantee time off, that I didn't have the budget to attend. Everyone was of the opinion that because my friendship with John was such a long one, I owe it to him to attend and that my friends also wanted to see me.", "Well to be fair, John was talking to them about it after I declined to go. Anything he wanted to say there probably gave him their side", "Thats a valid judgement. I just got tired of addressing different people about it.", "I don't know half of the story. John told me Lindsay admitted to it and it's my brother's fault for not declining", "I did talk to John about it when I said to him that I wasn't going to go. He's also seen the screenshots. He said she admitted she did it and essentially blames my brother. Neither of them think any of it was wrong and said it was my brother's fault and he should have shut it down. I know what their opinion is on the matter.", "What else was I meant to do, they wouldn't accept my reasoning so I figured the truth would be best, guess I was wrong for that", "Yeah, that sounds about right. Public accounting can be super toxic", "Under wraps one? Sp sexual harassment?", "Just fyi the word is \"protege\" (or \"prot\u00e9g\u00e9\"), not \"prodigy.\"", "And I'm guessing Lindsay is saying the opposite happened? Do you have details on her side of that story? If Lindsay was his boss, why did your brother get fired for going along with it? That should be the definition of coercion.", "I'm sure John will move on and find new friends. Are you going to do anything else? Or was this enough revenge", "So Lindsay and your brother had a sexual relationship? But your brother was let go for being bad at his job? \n\nWhat does your brother say happened and what does Lindsay say happened?", "We\u2019re not judging John\u2019s actions here, just yours. It\u2019s not that hard to air other people\u2019s dirty laundry. Just say no.", "I think you should have simply declined the invitation but left the reason as a personal  decision  without giving the details? You could have left it as Lindsay had history with your family and left the details out of it.", "Yeah, they'd sleep together and didn\u2019t tell their workplace about it. She asked him not to. I didn't know if my post would get flagged if I had it in there", "John told me she admitted to it and that they worked late together and had a relationship but it's my brother's fault for being lazy at work and putting himself in such a position where he is so close to her. That my brother is lazy for not doing all the work and his own just built up so Lindsay had to help him.\n\nI know how hard my brother works. He held down 3 part time jobs during his degree. He's incredibly smart, graduated at the top. \n\nI don't know why Lindsay wasn't fired, she should have been.", "I'm not going to do anything else, I don't want to associate with the guy anymore", "Yes, she schmoozed him under the guise of him being the one she had her eye on out of all her trainees and piled him with more and more work and halted his review and progression.\n\nLindsay admitted what happened did indeed happen but says it his fault and framed him for being lazy.", "I did try to but everyone was persistent. I tried so many excuses to get around it", "My friends are very invested with my life as I am with them. We know all the ins and outs of everyone's life, even if we don't see eachother in person that much anymore. They would have pushed again and I would have had to lie again. The truth was much easier", "NTA and you need to put this in the original post, she pursued a sexual relationship with a subordinate, then made his work life untenable when it didn't work out.\n\nThat's absolutely harassment.", "That sounds like a *really* incompetent HR department... I'm not saying your brother is lying , because certainly men are harmed like this and HR is shitty. \n\nDo you know, though, what Lindsay's story is? Maybe your friend mentioned to you what Lindsay said your brother did?", "So it was a sexual relationship and then it ended and your brother wound up being fired because of poor performance? And your brother claims there was no validity to that and this was retaliation for him \u2026 ending things with her? Or what?", "Last sentence. Just say no. That\u2019s all you needed to do.", "Okay I can add that it. I thought my description was enough but I guess it doesn't come across that well", "Yeah that's probably what it was. I know that I'm biased towards my brother but he has always worked hard and I don't see any reason why he would tank a job he was so excited for.\n\nNo, I only have what John told me. When I told him what my brother said, he didn't see anything wrong with it which raised huge red flags to me", "The person who can start a relationship with a subordinate can very easily get someone get fired for \u201cpoor performance\u201d \n\nwe\u2019ll never know if op\u2019s brother was genuinely bad at his work ( op is obviously biased) but a honourable person would never start a relationship with a subordinate \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yes, he wanted to stop it because he started feeling wrong about it and she piled him with more work. He looked visibly stressed whenever I'd see him and he would always chalk it up to work and how much he needed to do to keep up", "They wouldn't take my no for an answer. Have you been reading what I've been saying? They were pissy with me for making excuses not to go so far in advance. I'm not going to settle and have my friends be annoyed at me instead of the 30 year old who sexually harassed my brother and fucked him over. They shouldn't get away with 0 consequences of action", "Yeah I agree i'm biased. My brother's always been a hard worker and was really excited when he got this job. I don't see why or how he'd tank so hard", "Your inability to set and maintain boundaries with friends doesn\u2019t excuse your behavior. You didn\u2019t have to make any excuses at all.", "Maybe because he wasn't smart enough to not sleep with his boss? \n\nMy guess is the truth is something more along the lines of your brother thought he was going to sleep his way to the top and started slacking off at the job.", "Try telling your friends of many years that you just don't want to go to one of their weddings, of course they're gonna push and ask"]}
