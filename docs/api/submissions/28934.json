This extends way past the issue with the phone. This is super-invasive, and you\u2019re being controlled. Almost 17 and you can\u2019t have social media? That\u2019s a parenting fail if you haven\u2019t used it as an opportunity to teach your kid about online safety. You haven\u2019t stepped out of line, so these continued checks on what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t about trust, because it sounds like you\u2019ve more than earned a long leash as far as trust goes. Question: what happens if you refuse to let them look in your phone?", "NTA\n\nWhat you are experiencing is controlling abusive behaviour the camera thing in your room and your door being taken away certainly is.\n\nYou have as much right to privacy as anyone else.\n\nReport this to CPS.", "Find somewhere in your room, under a shelf, or inside the closet, and leave an envelope there. On the outside, write \u201cprivate, do not open\u201d. On the inside, leave a note saying \u201cthis is why I never visit\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s only fair they should know why, and sometime after you move out, they\u2019ll find it.", "You're NTA but - and I wish someone had told me this at your age going through similar issues - you also can't do much about it. I remember feeling at the time how unjust it was and how I should be able to do or say something to make them understand and change. You can't unfortunately. They have the power. If you can tolerate it for another couple of years then do so. You'll be 18. You could get a job or go to college. Put your energy into good qualifications that will get you out of the house in the right way and you won't even have to look back if you don't want to. I didn't understand this at the time and wasted all my energy in the wrong fight, which just got me stuck in it even longer.\n\nTwo years seems like a lot when it's more than 10% of your life to date, but ultimately it's really not. If you can stick it, stick it.\n\nOf course if there are other issues here that you haven't disclosed and you really are finding it intolerable please disregard the above and contact a local professional who can help you. Good luck", "Do you pay for the phone or does your mom? That does kinda play into my opinion on whether she has a \u201cright\u201d to look at your phone. However, having cameras in your bedroom and no bedroom door is a waaaaaay bigger concern to me than the phone. Are you saying she can see you getting dressed and everything?", "NTA... your parents are too strict, and they probably don't know anything about social media platforms. They would probably have banned reddit first if they knew what you can find here.\n\nAnyway, I suggest talking to them and telling them that they're being annoying. They can't understand that if they don't check your phone you'll probably still be the same. They need to understand that they have to respect you, no matter what apps you and your privacy, no matter what apps you have on your phone. You have to tell them that you feel like being in a jail, where you can't do what you want to do. You have to make them feel guilty, and maybe they'll stop being so invasive.\n(Be aware that you may also be grounded, if you disrespect them while explaining this).", "NTA imo, respect is a two-way thing, and they seem to almost want to catch OP doing something. But I'm not the smartest or anything so I don't want to influence anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is s massive violation of your trust in her/them & respect for you. Every child needs to to be given a longer leash as they grow up. So that by the time they get t 18, they don't need one. & go crazy stupid & do all the stuff they shouldn't.\n\nBide your time, save your pennies, & get out as soon as you turn 18.\n\nGood luck.", "Nta. Close your phone with a password.", "nta your parents are controlling and abusive. hey op's parents, if youre reading the comments, youre utter failures if you think its remotely acceptable to not allow your nearly adult daughter a modicum of privacy. dont be shocked when she puts the two of you in a shitty nursing home.", "Yes and no.  Your parents should have some level of involvement in your life, and that may mean surveillance of some sort in this crazy world, but you are almost an adult.  I would simply ask your parents how they expect to maintain a relationship when they did nothing to prepare themselves and you for an real relationship between older child and parents.\n\nAt the very least, let them know how their intrusion makes you feel.  If I weren't so damned lazy, I would look up parenting articles that discuss the problems with their overreaching and invasive strategies.\n\nJust to be clear: camera = crazy surveillance state.", "You're NTA. But there's not much you can do that won't drive your mother to go even further. Cameras in your bedroom might be legally seen as abuse, but unless you have relatives who can help you with a lawyer, again, you're probably stuck. \n\nSo, you have a little more than a year before you are legally an adult, able to leave; start getting ready. First, don't search anything on your phone, use a computer at the public library and don't have anything in writing at home. You'll need your social security card, birth certificate, driver's licence, diploma (when you get it) and anything like a passport or other documents. Think about where they are, so you can collect them in one day. When you're free, you'll need to open your own, independent bank account; don't use a bank your parents use. If you have a way to save money and hide it outside your house, do it. This is crucial, you need to seem compliant. Work on viewing this as a magnificent plot, to free yourself once and for all from your parents' tyranny; so for a year, you'll be playing a role, acting as a dutiful, obedient child. Laugh inwardly at how you're fooling them, but don't let them see it's an act.", "NTA look up the term grey rock. Don\u2019t get emotional just always respond very blandly and neutrally to them.\n\nWhen you turn 18 get your own phone and don\u2019t rely on them for school or a place to live.  Look into how you can be independent maybe work full time and go to community college part time at night and rent a room somewhere. Solutions like that", "Delete all calls and texts as soon as you are finished. If/when they ask why there are none tell them you have cut back on communicating with your friends because they just go through them all.", "I would most likely get it forcefully taken and get grounded", "CPS won't do anything about strict parenting. They are far too busy trying to keep monsters from doing bad things and being forced to rehome orphans.\n\nI do feel that this is way too overprotective and OP should be prepared to leave the home (hopefully for college) and seek therapy for dealing with the multitude of ways that their parents have undermined their confidence, sense of security, and safety.", ">\u201cthis is why I *will* never visit\u201d. \n\nFify", "my mom pays for my phone I do have a job and pay for things like hygiene and my lunches for school ext. I don't have a camera in my room anymore but when I did have it she just told me to get dressed in the bathroom but the doorknobs my my bedroom and bathroom door where changed so they and be unlocked from the outside.", "Another option is setting your fingerprint only to unlock the phone, or change the pin code. You can also use your fingerprint to open certain apps or chats, so you can keep your privacy, and if they complain about it, just say your life it's not their business.", "Yeah, it sounds like I\u2019d be counting the days until I moved out. And I most definitely would be planning that.", "CPS won't do anything about her parents potentially producing, and viewing, kiddie p\\*rn....? Placing a camera in an area likely to catch a child's nudity constitutes that....", "As I said, the note should be found after she has moved out, and therefore at a point where \u201cnever visiting\u201d can already be spoken of as occurring.", "If she pays for the phone, I reluctantly say that it belongs to her and she is just letting you use it. I know it\u2019s not a popular opinion but it\u2019s how I was raised. Have you ever done anything that would make them distrust you this much?  (I only ask because I was a HORRIBLE teenager and my mother was intrusive like this\u2026. I see in hindsight that she was trying her version of protecting me but it was a terrible way to grow up). \n\nHowever the door thing really freaks me out. Like, what if there were a fire and you were locked in? That is very concerning to me.", "She still demand to 1) know why, 2) what she was hiding by having it locked, 3) to unlock it anyway, & 4) remove it.", "You think they will leave the room (& whatever she might leave behind), unsearched for very long after she moves out? I doubt she will have the opportunity to not visit prior to such a note being found.", "when I was 12 and had a phone I was talking to a guy I that was 13 and it was not exactly a pg 13 convo but no pictures or anything I didn't have a phone for 1 year and there was another time after like I said im not allowed to have snapchat but I downloaded it I never added anything or anything and deleted it after a day but somehow she saw that I have downloaded it before and I had a flip phone for a year", "Well, that is far from horrible behavior. You seem like a good person and like you\u2019re trying your best. I don\u2019t think YTA, I just think your parents are very strict. If you\u2019re planning on going away to college, I\u2019d start counting down the days to freedom. Good luck with everything.", "thank you"]}
