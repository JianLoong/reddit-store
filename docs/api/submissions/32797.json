I usually go to self checkout, but can\u2019t anymore with more than 10 items (new policy apparently)\n\nOne register open, we had probably 15 items.  Got in line with our cart behind at least 6 people. Guy checking out needs a manager. Long wait.

My daughter says she needs to go to the bathroom, but can wait a couple minutes. WBM hears this conversation. My kid is 3, so we have the same conversation many times. The line is much longer than when I started waiting now. Self checkout has no wait, and more than one worker per register. \n\nA second register opens, \u201cnext guest on 6\u201d. Since I was next, I started to move the one lane over to checkout and bring my daughter to the bathroom. WBM says to me \u201dCan I go in front of you, we only have 4 things?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I need to go, my daughter needs to use the bathroom\u201d. \n\nWBM was unhappy. She said (more than once, in a very sarcastic tone) \u201cwow, you are so generous\u201d. I was bit annoyed, I said back \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I got here first.

Why didn\u2019t she go to self checkout where there was no wait? After I said no, was it really necessary to comment? She seemed very surprised and taken aback that I didn\u2019t say yes to her. She clearly had kids and was probably in a similar situation as me at some point. Especially considering she could have gone to self checkout with no wait, why was it her expectation that I would say yes? Not that she would know this, but I have never asked to go in front of someone in a line, which is probably why this makes no sense to me. \n\nFirst Reddit post btw.
