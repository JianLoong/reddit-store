But for someone only just super religious to rush into aomething like this with someone so young is a lot of red flags. Even a year of her working extra and being sure would do a world of good but wanting to lock it down instantly and everything is to fast for the age imo.\n\n8 months in and thinking of marriage at 19 is a huge leap and I'd always be cautious even if it's what people want. It's just the get them before they know better and can be the perfect house wife stuff I find icky with this age gap.

Than have multiple kids before the age the brother currently is, find out its all wrong for them and then set back.
