I do think a 26 year old marrying a teenager (yes, she\u2019s a legal adult but also a teenager) he\u2019s known less than a year and never lived with for the purpose of quickly having kids is super sketchy and not likely to go well. I get the concern there and the want to potentially talk to him about it, though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna do anything and you\u2019re probably best to not bother. \n\nBut also, the woman being your age specifically is literally completely irrelevant. The age gap could be cause for concern (at this period in their life\u2019s specifically) but that has nothing to do with you being that age. If you were 40 and your brother 47, there would be nothing weird or wrong about him marrying a 40 year old.\n\nIt\u2019s not inherently weird in any way for him to date/marry someone the same age as his sibling. It is potentially weird that he\u2019s marrying a 19 year old, but not because she\u2019s your age.", "op i get what you feel i have a sibling (m24) dating a girl a year younger (21) than me. while it makes me slightly uncomfortable i cant do anything about it as its their relationship \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you can have your concerns but theres not much to really do", "Age gaps issues aren\u2019t about the difference in years, it\u2019s about how young the youngest is.

My older brother is 3 years older than me.  By your logic, he shouldn't have wanted to marry someone my age.", "You being so hung up on being the same age as her is ridiculous.  My husband is 5 years older than me.  I'm a year younger than his sister.  With your weird logic I guess we shouldn't have gotten married. \n\nIt doesn't sound like a great situation.  With how young she is and how quickly they're moving seems like a recipe for disaster. But you and her being the same age is irrelevant.", "But why is her being your age matter? You can take issue with 7 year gap but why do you keep comparing yourself to her?", "A 26 year old who very quickly wants to marry someone who 1. He's dated for 8 months and never lived with. 2. Became legal last year and thus is most likely in a very different place in life than he is and 3. Is a born again christian who went through a big change in his life (religion) and is making a very big desicion very early in a relationship. It's creepy. \n\nIt's probably a culture thing but where I live, people marry at around 30 and start having kids at about 27 ish. They finish high school at 19.

You wanted people to agree with you and are being super defensive of the people who aren't", "I think the reason people aren't seeing your side is instead of focusing on the age gap which many *do* find icky with those current ages, you seem more focused on the fact that she also shares that age with you.

But your examples aren't maturity anyway. Older women can also \"study so hard\" and be \"so bright\" then later decide being a SAHM isn't for them. What about women that got masters degrees then had kids at 28? They spent all their life in education then married. You're allowed to change your mind as you get older and there's nothing wrong with doing what you think will make you happy when you're younger.", "I would (and have) argued that it does in fact make her more mature. Graduating with a bachelor's degree less than 2 years out of high school is a monumental task. The amount of dedication and mental/emotional fortitude required to accomplish it is immense. Most students that attempt it don't make it and burn out quickly. I'd wager her mental age is higher than the bulk of her graduating class.", "I find it icky in the context of lifegoals and experience. \n\nThis woman is 19 and finishing her bachelors, she has the whole world ahead of her.

But plenty of 19 year olds aren't experienced enough or mature in the non academic aspects yet. 26 to 33 would be more acceptable with the same gap.

All the aforementioned individuals are extremely well-educated people with a zero interest in religion. All had a healthy and equal relationship with no contol issues, or, god forbid, spousal abuse. My husband was at the University together with my brother, I think I may have even seen him in the corridor when we were visiting my brother at the student dorm as a kid. Never bothered me at all. \nGuess what? Independent and mentally competent adults get to decide whom and how to marry. I honestly fail to understand reddit's view of the age gap in a marriage. I would probably be more concerned with the weird obsession with weddings. My point being is \"what's fair is foul, what's foul is fair\".", "I just don't think a 19 year old also wanting kids is a reason to marry in under a year. I'd want them to at least work a bit and see if they want something else from life. Rushing marriage with someone that hasn't even seen adult life and hoping the whole full parental responsibility right away is going to work out is a stretch. \n\nLike if you are in this situation with a 26 year old woman you at least know its what you want as a couple for sure. But for someone only just super religious to rush into aomething like this with someone so young is a lot of red flags. Even a year of her working extra and being sure would do a world of good but wanting to lock it down instantly and everything is to fast for the age imo.\n\n8 months in and thinking of marriage at 19 is a huge leap and I'd always be cautious even if it's what people want. It's just the get them before they know better and can be the perfect house wife stuff I find icky with this age gap. A year outside of schooling and dating longer to eben make sure ideals reallt align before engagement  is the only thing that'd make me feel differently. Many 19 year olds can know what they are doing but I think most arent really ready for some outcomes or what is out there. \n\nIs why I don't get why someone wouldn't just date a woman that's got a chance to live equally to them and knows for sure. Than have multiple kids before the age the brother currently is, find out its all wrong for them and then set back. I don't see how anyone at 26 wouldn't be greatly worried a 19 year old partner might not grasp all of this yet as you can just look at yourself at 19 vs 26 and know what they don't know yet.", "Still doesn\u2019t make her an adult just because she\u2019s further along others in her age group.", "8 months is plenty of time to know if you're ready to spend your life with someone, it's not dodgy to be ready for commitment give me a break", "Let\u2019s be real.

I feel like you're severely underestimating how much dedication it takes to graduate college less than 2 years out of High School. She was focused and determined to make this happen, and had the emotional/mental fortitude to follow through with her goals. She's every bit mature enough to make up the difference in a 7 year age gap (which isn't that much to begin with).", "No it\u2019s isn\u2019t. Great rebuttals here.\n\nThen move in together? Don\u2019t marry and knock up some who isn\u2019t old enough to drink alcohol in America?", "Yea cause 21 is 3 years into being an adult. I feel you\u2019re overestimating how intelligent she is just cause she graduated college at 19. You have no idea what kind of institution she graduated from.

I know what these kids are like, if anything, I'm underselling her.", "3 years into being an adult ? Dude wtf. You don't start being an adult once you turn 18, that's only the legal definition.\n\nI started being an adult when I got a job, lived alone, paid for my own expenses, etc ... 17 in my case. I know people who are 21 and can't do their laundry by themselves or cook. I agree that age matters to some point and OP's situation seems fishy but y'all are lacking a lot of nuance when talking about litteral grown ups.", "So now she is a adult ?", "I know people who have their Bachelors and took them 2 years. Still means nothing towards their emotional intelligence or being prepared for adulthood. College degrees don\u2019t  mean anything when it comes to relationships or emotions. At the end of the day this is about a 26 year old trying to marry a 19 year old after only 8 months together and only cause they want kids right away. That\u2019s screams red flags"]}
