Never bothered me at all. \nGuess what? Independent and mentally competent adults get to decide whom and how to marry. I honestly fail to understand reddit's view of the age gap in a marriage.

I'd want them to at least work a bit and see if they want something else from life.

But for someone only just super religious to rush into aomething like this with someone so young is a lot of red flags. Even a year of her working extra and being sure would do a world of good but wanting to lock it down instantly and everything is to fast for the age imo.\n\n8 months in and thinking of marriage at 19 is a huge leap and I'd always be cautious even if it's what people want. It's just the get them before they know better and can be the perfect house wife stuff I find icky with this age gap. A year outside of schooling and dating longer to eben make sure ideals reallt align before engagement  is the only thing that'd make me feel differently. Many 19 year olds can know what they are doing but I think most arent really ready for some outcomes or what is out there. \n\nIs why I don't get why someone wouldn't just date a woman that's got a chance to live equally to them and knows for sure. Than have multiple kids before the age the brother currently is, find out its all wrong for them and then set back.

I think this is a great discussion, actually. :)\n\nLet's just focus on the last paragraph of your argument because it's one I've recently contemplated and came to an interesting, albeit statistically unlikely conclusion. From what I'm inferring, you view this young woman as being a victim of what is essentially having a doctrine imposed upon her without giving her the opportunity to know anything else. I'm not saying I disagree, but I'm going to assume the position that this was a choice of her free will, and she does not share your view. \n\nI'm going to talk in extremes to set up a scenario to illustrate a point. Please don't think I subscribe to anything outlandish here. This point is just to offer a perspective to give insight into why I don't view anything wrong with this relationship, or rather, why I don't make any negative assumptions. \n\nLet's say a religion existed where women were 100% slaves to men. Their purpose was to marry and serve their husband, and to not be allowed any exposure to the rest of the world to influence their view; to insight blasphemous thoughts. To you and I, this religion should be abolished to the point of making it illegal. It's obviously abusive to women. But what if there was a woman who did not want another life? Who was genuinely happy with both this arrangement and  the doctrine the religion preached? Can you still say she's subject to abuse? If so, ask yourself one simple question. To her, wouldn't your beliefs just sound like the doctrine of a different religion you want her to accept?\n\nThis is, again, extreme. I truly hope there is no woman who would embrace such abuse. But the point is that just because someone believes in the religion they follow, it doesn't mean they're a victim. And just like they are beholden to their beliefs, the beliefs of a non-believer might as well be the same as practicing a different religion to them in its entirety. Ultimately, just as you wouldn't want them to do to you, it's unfair to impose these beliefs on them or to make assumptions about their happiness. \n\nI'm atheist. I actually feel shadenfreude at the thought that most religious practitioners are likely headed to the hell of their own religion because religion disgusts me. But I would never dare to hold any person of any belief to my own moral or ethical beliefs. Doing so makes me no different from a preacher. \n\nSo, circling back to OPs story. A born again Christian, who is most likely taking Christinity at extreme face value, is thinking of asking his 19 year old gf to marry him because she does not believe in children before marriage, but wants children. What I can infer from this is that she's **extremely** devout. But given that she's completing her bachelor's, she's also very academically gifted, but also from a household that isn't *trying* to wedge her into a gender role. If they were, they would not have signed off on her getting post-secondary education so soon. This suggests to me that she's actually very much a believer of her own religion; it's her choice. Again, if it wasn't her choice, I don't think she would be getting this level of continued education.\n\nThe oddball here is actually OPs brother. What does he bring to the table for her? I can make many blind assumptions, but ultimately, I choose to believe there's enough there that she's making an informed decision in being with him. \n\nI will say this, though. With everything I highlighted above, even if she agrees to the proposal, I do doubt they would expedite the marriage.\n\nEdit: \"negative assumptions\""]}
