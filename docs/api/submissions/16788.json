I was very picky when we were together when it would come to his food and him wanting me to try new foods. But because I have never had some before (different cultures where in mine a lot of foods are either bland or drenched in mayo) I didn't like them when he/his family cooked it. I was happy ordering my ready meal programme but he wasn't having any of it.

When my current partner made me some, I have actually enjoyed it and also loved it in the restaurants we have been to, so I know neither beef or duck supposed to taste the way Pete cooked them.\n\nHe knew how to make things I like and it is still I would prefer to either make myself or order.

She taught everyone at the table that she is not the one to mess with.  Good on her.", "Then it makes her look passive in front of her boss and future business partner.
