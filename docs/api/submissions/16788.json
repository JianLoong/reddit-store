I was very picky when we were together when it would come to his food and him wanting me to try new foods. But because I have never had some before (different cultures where in mine a lot of foods are either bland or drenched in mayo) I didn't like them when he/his family cooked it. I was happy ordering my ready meal programme but he wasn't having any of it. After our separation I have started going to other places more and trying other different foods or then foods he would try to make me, and started realising I actually like them and it was the way he was cooking them (mostly bland or very overcooked, like only making well done steak, which I find not being appetizing, but then actually enjoying it done to medium/medium rare when my current partner makes them)", "Her ex was acting unprofessional to start, wasn't her.", "Sounds like she tried everything to *avoid* it and only made a comment to shut it down when he started berating her.

When my current partner made me some, I have actually enjoyed it and also loved it in the restaurants we have been to, so I know neither beef or duck supposed to taste the way Pete cooked them.\n\nHe knew how to make things I like and it is still I would prefer to either make myself or order. He didn't like that at a time I was only eating 1-3 types of meat and mostly fruits and veggies, while he is a full on meat and heavy carb eater.", "Why should OP have been requires to explain her dietary preferences or history at a business dinner?

She taught everyone at the table that she is not the one to mess with.  Good on her.", "Then it makes her look passive in front of her boss and future business partner.
