Her dad and I are on minimal speaking terms (not my choice, he chooses not to get along with me) and he is recently engaged and his fiancee is pregnant (I barely know her). I used to be very close to his entire family (they are tight-nit) as my ex and I were highschool sweethearts, but since the split I am very low contact except with his mom who will always hold that mom #2 place in my heart, and even then I only see her when my kids are involved. \n\nMy daughter invited me to her party and I want to go because she wants me there. Her dad told me he would pick her up from my house and take her and her little sister to the party, so I mentioned that she had invited me to come. He responds that it's the first time his fiancee's and his families will be meeting and he \"won't say no\" to me coming, but asked my to \"respectfully decline\" my daughter's invitation.\n\nThe day of her birthday my daughters will be with me and we will celebrate, but it won't be a big party with her friends, etc.\n\nWhat would make me the AH here? Declining and potentially hurting my daughter's feelings (which is not what I want to do) or attending (and possibly making adults act like adults).\n\nUpdate:\nWow thank you everyone for your input! I got great points for and against attending. I told my ex that he shouldn't pin it against me if I declined and told him that any events moving forward centered around our daughter would include me (of course if my kiddo wants me there). I'll let him have this petty win and be super happy I get my daughter the day of her birthday solely with me and my side of the family and make it super special for her. This whole situation just sucks, but this will be the last chance I give him to ever \"control\" me again when it comes to doing what is best for our daughter. For now keeping him happy keeps my daughters happy, so I will do what I need to do to keep the peace. I told her that this year she gets one day to celebrate with mom, the other with dad. I didn't get much of a reaction, but she did seem disappointed. ..And I'll have to duplicate this schedule later this year when her younger sister turns five.\n\nUpdate 2: \nI also messaged him:\n\"Although I am pretty disappointed that you have chosen your fiance over your daughter's birthday wishes, I told her that she will have one celebration with each parent this year. I hope all of her future events will be about her, and not your fiance, in-laws, or anyone else quite frankly, and I can attend in peace. Have a good evening.\"\nI won't engage if he responds, but he gets to know these celebrations won't be about anyone but our daughter from now on.\n\nUpdate 3:\nHoly smokes guys, my ex actually TOLD MY DAUGHTER the sentiment behind my last message to him. She called me asking why I think dad values his fiancee over her. What the actual duck. I had her promptly put him on the phone for a conversation about what is appropriate for children to understand about grown-up disagreements. He disagreed, while stating she doesn't understand social nuances of the party invitation while thinking she should be privvy to my message. He also said his point about the introduction was just an excuse for me not to come. In the end I told him to not throw me or his fiancee under the bus when he could just say to me \"you're not welcome don't come\" and then apologized to my daughter for her getting more involved than necessary in an adult misunderstanding.

Divorced dad with kids here. It\u2019s not about you or your husband. It\u2019s about your daughter. Honestly, if his daughter wants her mom there, the father should put his feelings aside and welcome you for the sake of his daughter. It\u2019s called co-parenting, he should want to make his daughter happy, especially on her birthday. The fact that he\u2019s not doing this speaks volumes for his character. Also, using a kid\u2019s birthday party to have the two families meet for the first time is weird to me. That\u2019s just one more thing that takes the attention away from the birthday girl.", "NTA \n\nIt's a party for the kid, not a party so his family and his fianc\u00e9e's family can meet. If your daughter wants you to go, and you're not going to make a scene or anything, then you should go. The kid comes first between you two, especially on her own birthday.", "NTA, I am the child of a very early life divorce,  my parents hated eachother. But they can play nice for the sake of the child (ME)... WTF are some people thinking in here??? If I wanted them both there they were both there, new partners in tow... It was never an issue and to do that to your 8 year old daughter just because her father doesn't want you there?? He is being the AH here putting his feelings over his child's ON HER BIRTHDAY\n\nEdit to add my mother was never the nicest about my father on every other day of the year, but if I wanted him there for an event they could suck it up", "NTA Talk to your ex again and find a compromise.  Maybe you come late, just come for cake and presents, or something like that so that his gf can spend some time with his family. But he should think of your daughter, not just his new girlfriend. This is supposed to be a birthday party for an 8 year old, not a coming out party for his gf.", "Info: if you have a custody agreement, what does that say? If it says you and Dad agree to stay away on each other's days (even celebrations) don't chance it.\n\nFeel free to soften the blow by telling your daughter you \"aren't feeling well\" the day before and don't want to spread germs.", "If the daughter invited you then go.NTA", "NTA. Always prioritize your daughter. If ex does not want you there, let *him* explain that to your daughter.", "NAH.   \n\n\nIn a perfect world, all members of former and blended families would happily attend each other's events and there would be no problems whatsoever. I weirdly actually do have this experience; my ex and I get along fine and host a single birthday party with our families for our son, and it's always just...fine.   \n\n\nBut oftentimes, that is \\*not\\* the case. In some cases, what is truly best for the child is allowing each parent to create their own spaces and happy experiences because there is simply too much extraneous nonsense to make blended events work.   \n\n\nThe worst possible outcome here is that you attend, it causes a conflict that bubbles over to your daughter, and her birthday becomes about adults in conflict instead of her birthday. If that is one of the possible outcomes, then I think it is worth considering a special birthday experience with you without the added layer of the ex in laws, new fiancee, etc.", "NTA\n\n>and possibly making adults act like adults\n\nYou nailed it right there. If they can't handle this for the benefit of an 8-year-old, they sound immature as fuck.

This is about your daughter. And if your ex is using his daughters birthday as an excuse for something important to him (families meeting for the first time) that\u2019s on HIM. Because this isn\u2019t about that. This is about celebrating your daughter\u2019s birthday. She wants her mom there. That should be the end of discussion, but your ex decided to put his fianc\u00e9e and her family above his daughter on her birthday. That\u2019s unacceptable.", "Nta. Because this isn't a party for his family and his fiance's family to meet.  That's just something that is happening. It's your child's party. She wants you there. \n\nYou say in the comments that he was abusive hence the divorce you also mention how he is trying to alienate her. And she thinks you make excuses. Not going to the party is going to fed into that and he may even be like see your mom made an excuse. \n\nAlso courts don't like when a parent tries to alienate a child against the other. If this is in fact a problem you should get on top of that now.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to be mature enough to behave together for your daughter's sake", "NTA \n\nI am very strongly in the camp of \"whatever the birthday kid wants, the birthday kid gets\".

Birthday girl wants her mom there.", "My partner's parents have been divorced for 10 years this year, and they both went out for dinner with them for their 21st birthday a few days ago. \n\nThey have been divorced for a *decade* and still managed to put their own feelings aside for their child's special day. Your ex needs to learn this style.", "NAH. I get wanting to go especially if your daughter asked. You just have to be aware that if you go and there is drama, then that could ruin your daughters birthday party. It might be better to explain it to her yourself rather than go and risk it.", "NTA (especially after reading your subsequent comments)\n\nBut there is a middle ground here. \n\nInstead of him picking up, you take them there a little early, say hi to your former in-laws, give your girls a big hug, tell them to have fun and that you will pick them up at the end. Put on a big warm smile and be the class act as you gracefully leave.\n\nIf your daughter asks, be age appropriate honest: Mommy is having one party and Daddy another, so you will come for a minute and be at home with a movie, popcorn and blankets everywhere for a sleepover in the living room where you want to hear all about their day.", "NTA, your daughter wants you there.", "NTA.\n\nHe should prioritize your DAUGHTER and not his fianc\u00e9s family.\n\nIf your daughter wants you to be there, be there. \n\nFrankly, You would be the AH if you wouldn\u2019t show up even though it\u2019s clearly important to your daughter.\n\nOf course you\u2019re in no way the AH here, but you need to have a serious discussion with your ex. \nDemands and grudges like this are unacceptable.\n\nIt feels like there\u2019s not one child, but rather two children involved (aka your ex).", "You\u2019re in a very tricky situation and tbh with you (kid with divorced parents who are similar to you and you ex) there is no winning here. To your daughter, she just wants both parents at her party. And while 8 is old enough to understand that mom and dad don\u2019t love each other anymore, she most likely doesn\u2019t understand the logistics of what her invitation meant. If you go, your daughter would be very happy and it\u2019s up to your ex to man up and actually be a parent rather than thinking of himself. On the other hand, if you go, there is a chance of causing drama and from the sound of it, your ex would put being unkind to you over his child\u2019s happiness. I, personally, wouldn\u2019t go, just to avoid any potential problems. Maybe you can compromise by being the one to drop your daughter off? Come in for a minute, have a cupcake and then leave, maybe say hi to ex mil. Make it brief so that way you can maybe make up for not being there the entire time and your ex can\u2019t raise a stink since you\u2019ll only be there long enough to do pleasantries. Good luck, this one is tricky.", "NTA. But, honestly? As it is a party *his parents* are hosting, and you are still on good terms with your former MIL, I think I\u2019d talk with her. If nothing else, you\u2019d be able to make it clear that 1) your daughter invited you, and 2) you have no desire to make a scene with your ex and his fianc\u00e9e and her family. This gives her a chance to arrange things in a way that maybe lessens the *opportunity* for anyone to make a scene. \n\nAfter all, if your ex is getting remarried, his fianc\u00e9e and her family are about to become a part of your daughter\u2019s life. It might be nice to see how they interact with her, and for them to meet you and accept the undeniable fact of your existence in her life, as well. As her grandmother, your ex-MIL might even suggest that *she* invited you so that your daughter might celebrate with ALL of the adults who love and care for her. \n\nI would, however, still have that age appropriate conversation with your daughter and explain that, for the adults, things might be a little awkward, at least at first, but that *both* of you need to display your party manners and be polite to everyone who is there. That includes not trying to ignore or ice out dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or her family.\n\nIdeally, you will all be able to come together for her when she needs you or has a milestone. As a pool party, there will be space available and things happening that can facilitate, but not force, interaction between the different families. A more forgiving opportunity for introduction than many I can think of. Ideally, you might discover that you even like one another. (Which might be one of the things your ex is worried about. But, that\u2019s his problem.)\n\nGood luck.\n(Edited to correct a badly structured sentence.)", "NTA. \nWhy would he choose his daughter\u2019s birthday party as a chance for his fianc\u00e9 to meet the family ?", "NAH. While you're not supposed to be asking for advice here, I'd suggest asking your ex if it would be a good compromise for you to come toward the end of the party as an extended picking her up time, so you can join your daughter at her party as she wants while still respecting his family time.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA. This is your daughter birthday. It\u2019s not about whatever situations he got going on. It\u2019s about YOUR DAUGHTER. It\u2019s not about dad.", "This isn\u2019t about your ex, it\u2019s about your daughter. He decided to add in a small personal gain with the whole in laws meeting in laws. This day isn\u2019t at all supposed to be about him and I find it just a tad selfish for him to ask the mother of his child to consider not going after his kid asked her to. But it doesn\u2019t sound like he asked this with a malicious intent, just rubbed the wrong way. If you decide to go, maybe send him a text saying that you don\u2019t want to make anything weird for him but that your daughter asked you to go and you don\u2019t want to miss out or disappoint her, all you want is to be cordial and be there for your daughter and you sincerely hope the meeting of in laws goes well for him. If you decide to skip out just buy a little extra treat for when your daughter gets home, like a special cake or food from her fav takeout place. \n\nNAH. You don\u2019t have to go for the sake of keeping peace, but while your ex wasn\u2019t malicious it\u2019s really not about him.", "NTA.If he wants you to decline your mutual child's invitation he should explain why to your daughter.  His family and fianc\u00e9e family meeting is more important than her birthday celebration.", "NTA although I am very much on the fence. It\u2019s not at anyone\u2019s house. Your kiddo asked if you could come(and this is a confusing age when it comes to divorce). Whether ripping off the bandaid and meeting future stepmom\u2019s family at your daughter\u2019s birthday party is the right move or not, you won\u2019t know until you are there. If nothing else, go and hang back a bit. Be polite to everyone if they talk to you, and be a good mom to your daughter.  If it is super awkward, give your kiddo a hug and say good bye.", "Nta \nYou wouldn't be if you went but don't go because it would cause future problems with him but have him explain to he why he doesn't want you to show up to the party", "it's your daughter's birthday. she asked you to attend. you did the adult thing and informed your ex. your ex needs to adult up and play night. NTA for attending your daughters birthday, especially after she intentionally invited you.", "NAH  \nAlthough you'd be going for your daughter, I believe you should take into perspective the future of your relationship with your daughter and the dad. This moment does seem like a big thing for your ex husband and trying to at least maintain some kind of healthy relationship with him will at least help your relationship with your daughter. Maybe try and meet in the middle with the dad and ask if you can at least just drop by for a short period to see your daughter vs staying the entire time?", "NTA - This is your child, and she wants you there. She is the deciding factor to me.\n\nThe fact that your ex made this party a meet and greet for the two families is not your problem. Do your best to keep your distance from the two families and don't interfere with any of it. Just focus on your child.

If they try to make it about anything else - you just say \"this is my daughter's party, so I am not discussing this right now\" or something. If you make any kind of scene or cause trouble, then YWBTA, but it doesn't sound like that is your intent.", "NTA.  I agree with the other comments that it's not a good time for two families to meet and it should be about your daughter.    Just be prepared for things to be super awkward.

This party is for an 8 year old child not his new gf.", "I think it\u2019s best to stay away to avoid any potential conflict/tension at a kids birthday party. Your daughter will likely not notice if you\u2019re there or not as she\u2019ll be playing with her friends.", "NTA. If he wants the families to meet in neutral territory he should arrange a dinner. I would say, though, let him pick the kids up and take them. You drive separately, make an appearance, but maybe don't stay the entire party.", "NTA its your daughters birthday and she wants you there. Case closed.", "NAH...

Reading the OP, there are some serious red flags. The pushback against his not unreasonable boundaries (choosing to be on minimal speaking terms and only talk about the children and parenting them, which they're clearly still doing from the conversation in the OP, is perfectly reasonable). The fact that despite knowing these boundaries are in place, the dad only found out she planned to attend when calling to arrange pickup. She could have simply reached out and discussed it proactively when the daughter asked her to come. Were you planning to just show up unexpectedly?\n\nThe reality of kids in split relationships is that they have to get used to the idea that they now have two separate families.

Who doesn't love more cake? \n\nIf your daughter truly asked you unprompted, that's very sweet.

Then on your actual birthday we'll get to celebrate and have a great time too.\" If handled with grace, the very worst case scenario would be your daughter being mildly disappointed, which would very quickly be forgotten as soon as she got to hang out with all her friends or have cake and ice cream. Instead you've built it up and now risk more serious disappointment instead. But you still shouldn't go, because that sort of tension is very likely to distract from the party even in a best case scenario, and don't think your kid won't feel that. \n\nIf you want a big birthday party for your daughter, have one. You're free to have a party as well, you don't have to jump in and be a part of his. If you had wanted to do so, then discussing it ahead of time would have been the move, and contributing to it for that matter. What kid is going to be upset they get two parties? You can even invite his family and him if you want to, because its your party. When you host a party though you get to choose the guest list. If you're hosting it for someone you can certainly consider their wants and needs, but you also have to consider the overall picture. If hosting a separate big party's not feasible, you can still do an awesome smaller scale celebration. Make her favorite dinner. Or go out for a great meal. Have an awesome cake/ice cream. Put up decorations. Make it memorable. \n\nIn a perfect world parents would be able to put their own issues aside and have a friendly relationship for the sake of their kids. But that's not always practical. Some people truly can't get along, the history is too deep and the wounds too hurtful.
