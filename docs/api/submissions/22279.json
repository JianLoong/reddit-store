We met age 16 & now we're 40, nothing has ever happened or even close. I'm happily married & she soon will be. I think of her the same way I do my sister.\n\nThe debate is, AITA for getting her a birthday gift that I knew she'd love, even though it was expensive?\n\nAs I said, Charly & I have known each other for 20+yrs & we've always been close, we've been together through a huge amount & she's my most trusted confidante. She's godmother to my kids & was a bridesmaid at my wedding. I am the one she always calls with good news/for help & I know she trusts me with her life.\n\nShe does well financially, but I am very lucky & make a lot of money. Charly's fiancee on the other hand isn't so well off - he makes about \u00a320k/yr. She obviously doesn't care, but it's important for the story.\n\nNow, last week was Charly's 40th birthday! Our group of friends includes a party planner, so it was a hell of a Weekender!\nAs it was an important birthday, her man (Fred) chose to propose \ud83d\ude42 He actually did it a week early, so as to catch her off guard & she was thrilled. The ring was small but beautiful, he did good!\nI've been planning my gift for a while as I always knew what I wanted to get her once I was financially able. As far back as our teenage years, Charly has spoken of wanting to travel to Egypt, to cruise the Nile & see the pyramids. However, she is a wheelchair user, so has always struggled to find accessible trips within budget.\nBut I found a travel company for wc users & used them to plan a trip of a lifetime for 2. The company were amazing & the 3 week trip is all wc friendly, she will get to see all the sites she has dreamed of & I've even managed to bag her a stay in a hotel thats special to her.\nYes, it was v.pricey. But, to me she is worth it & I can easily afford it. I ran it past my wife before booking & she thought it was an excellent idea. We travel a lot as a family, so she said she was happy that Charly could too.\n\nAt her birthday bash, I gave her a snow globe with a sphinx inside, which confused her slightly, but then handed her the itinerary. She was blown away & so happy. She can't stop talking about it. Due to the timings, she's even suggested using it as a honeymoon. I love this idea.\n\nBut, yesterday I got a text from a mutual friend. She said I should be ashamed of myself for getting Charly such an expensive gift, when I knew Fred 'couldn't compete'. I never saw it as a contest, plus I knew he was going to propose. This friend continued by saying many of our mutual friends were mad at me for 'upstaging' Fred & 'flaunting my wealth' when I should've gone more low-key.\n\nFred hasn't said anything to me & seemed happy at the party, but I'm going see him tomorrow to ask if he's OK.\n\nWas it OK to give my best friend a gift she has wanted for years or AITA?\nWhat have I missed here?", "created_utc": 1689400632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1503ksj/aita_for_buying_my_best_friend_a_gift_her_fiancee/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So it's a double gift really.\n\nNTA\n\nContext matters, there are some expensive gifts that might have been inappropriate but this isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nIt's not as if you got her more expensive jewelry to outshine the ring.", "Assuming she might want to use your gift as her honeymoon, I assume that she and Fred will go on the trip?\n\nYou're NTA, it's a very kind and thoughtful gift. When you check-in with Fred, be mindful about it.", "Imo what you've missed is other envious friends who would love to have a bestie who buys them an awesome, thoughtful present on a milestone birthday. Speak to Fred, ease your mind. And if your wife, Fred and Charly are happy and okay with it, don't worry about everyone else. And certainly don't listen to hearsay from one disgruntled guest. NTA", "NTA it was a gift for the both of them.", "It seems weird to be accused of flaunting your wealth while you're sharing it. I'm guessing it was people who didn't get a gift like this who are saying that. \n\nThat said, I could definitely see Fred feeling emasculated while also appreciating the trip. He could also feel threatened by your closeness. If it turns out he's not conflicted, then the other people can get over it. \n\nAn open and honest conversation needs to happen.", "NTA - It sounds like you clearly don't have any ulterior motives.\n\nAs long as your friend and her Fiance understand that this is purely just a very good friendship then I don't see what's wrong with it.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being a good friend.", "NTA. If someone bought my partner and I a dream trip, I\u2019d be ecstatic. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going on their honeymoon.", "NTA. First of all, you don't actually know whether Fred is offended or not so those friends can shove it. Second, that sounds like a thoughtful gift that can be used as a honeymoon. Also, it's down to Charly to accept the gift or not.", "INFO\u2014 is it supposed to be a trip for you and her? Or for her and her fianc\u00e9?", "NTA - all of these \u201cfriends\u201d are jealous Charly was on the receiving end and not them. This is projection and it\u2019s disgusting.

I'm sure he'll enjoy it too, and it will be nice for him to take a trip he couldn't otherwise afford.", "NTA. It's not fair to anyone that you can't do something nice for your friend because her fiancee can't afford it, least of all your friend. She shouldn't get less when there's a friend willing to give her more because of bad social cues.\n\nThat being said, I can absolutely see a world where the fiancee might feel a certain kind of way for all of the obvious reasons, so it might be a nice thing just to have a conversation and make sure he's in the right headspace with it.", "Absolutely NTA. Only someone Very selfish would be angry their loved one got a, completely innocent, expensive gift from someone else.", "NTA. These 'friends' suck and are just jealous.", "NTA. Charly and Fred are lucky to have such a kind, generous friend - and they will have an unforgettable honeymoon.\n\nThe others need to mind their own business.", "I don't doubt that you had no ill intentions at all.
