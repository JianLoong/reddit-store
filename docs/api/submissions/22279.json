We met age 16 & now we're 40, nothing has ever happened or even close. I'm happily married & she soon will be. I think of her the same way I do my sister.\n\nThe debate is, AITA for getting her a birthday gift that I knew she'd love, even though it was expensive?\n\nAs I said, Charly & I have known each other for 20+yrs & we've always been close, we've been together through a huge amount & she's my most trusted confidante. She's godmother to my kids & was a bridesmaid at my wedding. I am the one she always calls with good news/for help & I know she trusts me with her life.\n\nShe does well financially, but I am very lucky & make a lot of money. Charly's fiancee on the other hand isn't so well off - he makes about \u00a320k/yr. She obviously doesn't care, but it's important for the story.\n\nNow, last week was Charly's 40th birthday! Our group of friends includes a party planner, so it was a hell of a Weekender!\nAs it was an important birthday, her man (Fred) chose to propose \ud83d\ude42 He actually did it a week early, so as to catch her off guard & she was thrilled. The ring was small but beautiful, he did good!\nI've been planning my gift for a while as I always knew what I wanted to get her once I was financially able. As far back as our teenage years, Charly has spoken of wanting to travel to Egypt, to cruise the Nile & see the pyramids. However, she is a wheelchair user, so has always struggled to find accessible trips within budget.\nBut I found a travel company for wc users & used them to plan a trip of a lifetime for 2. The company were amazing & the 3 week trip is all wc friendly, she will get to see all the sites she has dreamed of & I've even managed to bag her a stay in a hotel thats special to her.\nYes, it was v.pricey. But, to me she is worth it & I can easily afford it. I ran it past my wife before booking & she thought it was an excellent idea. We travel a lot as a family, so she said she was happy that Charly could too.\n\nAt her birthday bash, I gave her a snow globe with a sphinx inside, which confused her slightly, but then handed her the itinerary. She was blown away & so happy. She can't stop talking about it. Due to the timings, she's even suggested using it as a honeymoon. I love this idea.\n\nBut, yesterday I got a text from a mutual friend. She said I should be ashamed of myself for getting Charly such an expensive gift, when I knew Fred 'couldn't compete'. I never saw it as a contest, plus I knew he was going to propose. This friend continued by saying many of our mutual friends were mad at me for 'upstaging' Fred & 'flaunting my wealth' when I should've gone more low-key.\n\nFred hasn't said anything to me & seemed happy at the party, but I'm going see him tomorrow to ask if he's OK.\n\nWas it OK to give my best friend a gift she has wanted for years or AITA?\nWhat have I missed here?", "created_utc": 1689400632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1503ksj/aita_for_buying_my_best_friend_a_gift_her_fiancee/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And there is a point that I can cross where I think I\u2019m just making them feel self conscious. So just remember to make gifts about the small things too.
