It\u2019s been this way for over five years as she has health issues and is waiting on disability to get approved. She doesn\u2019t have many friends, and because she can\u2019t chip into activities, she doesn\u2019t get invited to a lot of events. That depresses her. I enjoy her company and make time for her knowing it\u2019ll be on my dime.\n\nBasically, if I want to hang out with her, I\u2019m footing the bill for food or paid activities, or even her gas money to get her to my house. I am okay with that - with one limitation\u2026\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much of an appetite and only takes a few bites out of something before declaring she\u2019s full. I\u2019ve learned this over the years, and I hate to see food wasted. If we\u2019re at a restaurant, she\u2019ll instruct the waitstaff to throw it away. I object, as she can eat it later, and she says it won\u2019t reheat well so she\u2019d rather just trash it. We\u2019re talking 80% of a meal right in the garbage. A meal I paid for. \n\nSo I\u2019ve come up with a choice system. 1. We eat at my house and I make us food in controlled portions.  2. We go to a very cheap place to eat.   3. We can go to the place she wants, but she orders something I can also eat so I can take the leftovers home. \n\nShe says I\u2019m controlling and weird. That I make her feel terrible about her budget. That a friend wouldn\u2019t offer to cover you only to have rules and regulations. She doesn\u2019t want to have to choose from my list. My point is that it\u2019s been five years since she could cover herself and the last two years I\u2019ve been very sensitive about wasting money. I grew up poor and struggled with affording food at many points. She grew up with money and is only now feeling the pinch. She lives with her dad presently and he covers her bills, but she doesn\u2019t have her own spending money. Her dad suffered financial struggles too so she doesn\u2019t get her allowance like she did as a teenager. \n\nI do enjoy hanging out and we talk, have a good time, and have common interests. But I want your opinion on whether I am being a controlling A. \n\nTL/DR: Broke friend throws away most of every meal at restaurants (which I pay for) so I came up with list of options to avoid food waste, like me cooking for us, going somewhere cheap, or her picking a meal I could also eat to take home leftovers. Now this friend says I\u2019m controlling.", "created_utc": 1700736015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181yhzj/aita_for_being_so_controlling_over_wherewhat_my/", "score": 770, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We went to a restaurant that I was paying for and she ordered what she wanted. A few bites in she tells our server she's done and please clear her plate. I asked our server to box it up because I was going to feed a homeless person who was more appreciative. My friend looked at me like I was crazy and I told her either you become appreciative and order a kid's meal because that apparently is all your stomach can hold or it would be the last time we went out to eat together. The next time we went out to eat, she started to place her order and I asked our server if they had that in the kids meal. Our server said yes and I said that is what she will take. My friend asked if I was kidding and I asked her if she had the money to cover her meal. When she said no I said that's your answer. Believe it or not the next time we went out for dinner she had the money to pay for her own meal. I have not gone after dinner with her since. You want to put your friend in her place, order her a kid's meal and see how she reacts. If she wants to act like a spoiled brat, treat her like one and only do it once. After speaking with some of our other mutual friends, they told me they have done the same thing and that is what has caused their friendships to end with her.

Then she throws yoir generosity back in your face by not eating the food she ordered and you paid for.  And now she's upset that you aren't willing to let her keep using you to entertain her.

She can pay her own way if she feels that entitled to my money.p\n\n\n\nLet me tell you the story of the straw that broke the camels back: I pick up the freeloading friend, and we head to get some fast food. We have not even pulled into the lot yet and she's got a pill bottle uncapped with a pill in hand. I realize she's not planning to pay for herself. I park up, tell her I gotta pee first and.....her face. I outplayed her. Her fucking *face* when she realized I wasn't paying for her lunch. I realized that she was using me because I was the only one dumb enough to keep hanging out with her.", "Your broke friend is an asshole.

Just stop.", "NTA. Another thing to consider is giving leftovers to homeless people? I tend to not finish my meals like your friend and I don\u2019t always want to eat the leftovers so sometimes I take them with me and give them to the first person I find living on the street. That way the food isn\u2019t wasted and I helped someone.", "NTA. I think you should have a heart to heart with her. Ordering what she wants and not taking a doggie bag may be her way of feeling like she is still rich. For you, wasting food feels unsafe. Figure out a way to talk about it. When I was really broke I would spend my last $5 on a burrito rather than beans and rice that would have fed me for a week. Buying practical food made me feel poor. Food insecurity makes you irrational.", "The simple answer is to do stuff that doesn\u2019t involve eating.", "NTA\n\nShe wants to look a gift horse in the mouth and then trash 80% of the gift.\n\nTell her that you don't want to control her choice, but you also don't want her to control your spending and expect you to pay for wasting a lot of food. Since you two have conflict over choice/waste with food, you will do non-food visits with her to remove the conflict. If she's really visiting with you for your company, she'll enjoy those visits.\n\nIf she complains that you are somehow discriminating or controlling because you won't just buy her food, I'd stop hosting her altogether. She can just wait till she figures out/gets her income flow going and then buy and throw away food to her heart's content (within her budget).", "NTA.\n\nBut I would drop the friend. and not because she is poor but because of her attitude and her entitled behavior. she just doesnt sound like a good friend.", "NTA\n\nOp, her money troubles are not why she has no friends. Her abuse of other people's funds and entitlement to spend those funds are why she has no friends.\n\nShe also has respect in general if she's both wasting food and your money right in front of your face.

If you want to make a good deed for her, you do it with no regulations. If you also can't afford it, this is a whole different thing - you can simply say so, since you're not obliged to pay.
