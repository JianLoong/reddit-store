My older brother died when he was only 2 days old and his intended name had been Joseph but mom wanted Angel to be his name since he passed so young. So Angel was the first name and Joseph was considered his middle name. I came along next and dad kinda/sorta named me. They couldn't agree and it was a coin toss. Dad's choice won. Robyn. Next came my sister and mom's choice, Elizabeth was used. Elizabeth was a family name as well as my mom's favorite name. Grandma and Great-Grandma were both Elizabeth. Grandma went by Liz while GG went by Betty.\n\nMy sister never liked her name and always preferred her middle name Briony. In school she asked to be called Briony and it took until she was 10 to tell the rest of the family she wanted to be called Briony instead of Elizabeth (Beth was the nickname most of the family used for her). Mom was upset and told her Elizabeth is her name and unless she wanted a nickname of Elizabeth, she would keep calling her that.\n\nBy now my sister is 20 and recently she legally changed her name to Briony and changed her middle name to something more unique. She told mom after she'd completed the name change but had warned her a couple of times from the age of like 16 that it was in the cards for her. Mom blew a fuse when she found out and told my sister she was spiteful and had ruined her lovely name. My sister said Elizabeth was the worst name she could have given her. So generic and bland and most of the nicknames sounded like they belonged on women over 50. Dad defended my sister and mom came to me to complain about it and them. She asked me how my sister could do that and acted as though I was on her side and should hate my sister for her choice. I told her Briony deserved to be happy with her own name and I know it hurt her, but she was still her baby, with a different name is all. Mom said I would never get it and I was as bad as them. I told her to get over herself and get over the name change or she'd risk losing Briony. Mom burst into tears for real and left. She called later and told me she hoped I was proud I made my own mom cry.\n\nI didn't like doing it but I do feel like she's being too over the top about it.

I would also say you were pretty gentle with her, much more than I would have been. \n\nYou tried to show her reason and she didn't want to see it.

Sounds like you tried to be honest and kind, and your mom escalated.", "NTA - sounds like you tried to be very patient with your mom. But that last comment, sheesh... I'd probably say something like, \"Well, mom, I hope you're proud of pushing one of your children away over a bruised ego.\"", "NTA. Your mom can feel however she does and she can not agree with your sister\u2019s name change, but she needs to respect and accept it.", "NTA. Her anger is misplaced. She\u2019s lashing out at you.", "NTA your sister can have whatever name she wants. Your mom should not have tried to bring you into this, that was inappropriate", "NTA. You did the right thing by sticking up for Briony. Her identity is not dependent on your mother's acceptance of it.", "NTA. Sounds like mom is trying to emotionally guilt you into siding with her. That's very toxic behaviour. \n\nYou absolutely said the right thing and your moms 'feelings' are just a ploy to get her way. Same guilt trip she has played on Briony for 10 years by the sounds of it. Thank you for being there for your sibling.", "NTA. Your mom had ten years advance notice of this. She could have used that time to come to terms with her irrational feelings but instead she chose to put her head in the sand, stubbornly continue calling your sister by a name she hates, and become upset when your sister finally legally changed her name. Your mom is a crybully who came running to you when her husband sided with your sister, and then when you refused to indulge her temper tantrum she ran off to look for someone else to coddle her. You should be proud of yourself: for not putting up with total BS from your mom.", "NTA \n\nYour sister made her choice as an adult and that is what it is. Mom will just have to deal.", "Nta. You are right and your mom needs to act like an adult.", "NTA. Your mom has every right to be upset I completely understand it.

You need to understand where your mom is coming from.  I have a daughter who recently came out as gender neutral & changed her name.  It's killing me & I'm still having trouble with it.  She's still my beautiful daughter, but her changing her name is hurtful to me.  It's like a loss.  But my daughter's happiness is more important to me than the loss I feel.  So I do my best to remember to call her by her new name & new pronouns.  It's difficult, but I do it for her.   Your mom needs to hear the truth, & her priority s/b your daughter's happiness, not her hurt feelings.  By continuing to be hurt by this, she is hurting her daughter.  She has got to get over her own hurt & try to do what makes her daughter happy.", "I think your sister and mother both sound like drama queens.  \n\nYour sister has gone by her middle name for years.

But I also think as she was getting older and in college and stuff that she was thinking long term. She mentioned that she hated filling out forms with Elizabeth and would sometimes forget herself and use Briony. I think getting rid of Elizabeth entirely was an FU to mom though. She could have just switched the order and maybe she would have if this wasn't a 10 year long issue between them.", "So I despised my first name and went by a nickname for years.  I regularly have to sign my name for work and I hated every day I had to sign that name.

Hopefully/maybe she just needs some time to process thru it. But if she chooses not to, like you said, it will ruin her relationship with your sister unfortunately", "Yeah, that's how I see it. Not changing the order of them like being Briony Elizabeth instead of Elizabeth Briony is probably a bit of a fuck you to mom.

You'd think she'd have jumped at the first chance to use such a perfect, meaningful name. \n\nNTA.

As a person who has named their child, I  understand where your mom is coming from.  Choosing your child\u2019s name is special and personal.  On the other hand, your mom needs to make a decision.  Does she love her daughter or a name more?  A name is just that a name.  Her daughter is a person with an identity.  You\u2019re spot on that she really needs to find a way to deal and accept her daughter or else she will risk losing her.", "If speaking the truth would make my mother cry, then yes, I'd be proud to make my mother cry.

Do not let her make you feel bad.", "NAH - my family does a similar thing with the naming. This is not about your moms \"ego\" being too big as some redditors are making it out to be. Its a way to honor past love ones and a way to remember them forever.
