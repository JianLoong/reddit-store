She got free house sitting AND pet sitting for two months and she wants you to pay the water bill?   Tell her to kick rocks.", "NTA\n\nGive her a reality check by presenting her with a pet sitting *and* house sitting bill. Tell her you'll substract the water bill, but expect payment within 2 weeks.\n\nDon't *actual* bill her, just show her what she saved when you did her a *favor*.", "NTA. Your friend is a crappy friend for expecting you to pay for her water bill when you did her this huge favor for free. She didn't say you weren't allowed to shower more than she does for fear of a higher bill (and that would be a crazy ask). And sheesh, when you're recovering from chemo, too?! Damn. Don't pay the bill and don't cat sit for her again, and maybe reconsider your friendship.", "NTA. You watched her cat for free.  There is no way a water bill could even come close to the cost of hiring a pet sitter or boarding her cat.", "NTA. And there\u2019s no diced standstill here, neither of you are backing down but the bill is in her name. Super tacky to expect you to do her a favor but also adjust your life to accommodate her habits.\n\nPS - I hope you\u2019re feeling better and on the mend.", "NTA\n\nThat you did this for free is super generous. That she's made an issue out of a *water bill* is ridiculous. You don't need to conform to someone else's water schedule while you're doing them a ginormous favor. She should be ashamed for being so rude and miserly.", "NTA.  She'd pay at least $50 a day for pet sitting in home.  So tell her you'll pay for the water when she pays you $3000 for your service.  Or Google pet sitting in your live and adjust the cost.\n\nDon't do any more favors for her.", "NTA. You house- and pet-sat for FREE for two entire months. Or, apparently, for the cost of some extra water. I can guarantee she got an amazing deal, even with an above-average water bill.", "NTA. If you weren't paid than that's your payment. I'm sure it's a lot less than what any competent house-sitter would have cost for two whole months.", "NTA. Housesitting doesn't include paying utilities. My sister had a \"friend\" who used her as a housesitter and renovation manager and made her pay utilities. I told her she was both housesitting and managing renovations and they should pay her and that utilities were their responsibility", "NTA.\n\nYou did this for free, so if she wants you to pay the water bill then give her a bill for the pet sitting for the duration, standard rates for that are available online.  I think she'll quickly change her tune and realize she still got a hell of a deal.", "NTA.   \nShe\u2019s lucky you paid to keep her fridge on, the house in good order, and the internet bill which is probably under a contract \u2026 or whatever you paid. You probably also saved her what? $20 a day? In cat boarding fees?   \n\n\nShe\u2019s crazy. And not a friend.", "I charged friend's and family I would pet sit for $30 per night and that was 10 years ago.", "You are NTA! \n\nDo not pay this bill at all please! I hope you are doing well after your chemo.\n\nYour friend is not being fair here. You did not need a place to stay so this was not a \"win-win\" situation. You did her a favor, for free. If the most she has to pay for this is the extra on the water bill, she is fortunate and you are a great friend!", "NTA It sounds like if you lost this friendship it wouldn't be a loss anyway, so stand your ground. If you want to be petty then send her the bill for your time of having to house sit and cat sit. If she's complaining about some extra on her water bill she couldn't afford you. \n\nHowever, if this is out of character behaviour, perhaps for whatever reason, she could be genuinely struggling with money (regardless of her profession) and finding the extra cash could be a problem she didn't take in to consideration and she's taking it out on you. \n\nYou did your friend a huge favour, I hope this doesn't prevent you from helping out other friends in the future, we all need friends like you.", "NTA", "NTA unless you both explicitly agreed you would pay the bill it is her responsibility and the price of having a house sitter.", "NTA. You did free labor. She\u2019s tacky for asking.", "NTA. An in-home petsitter in my town starts at $40/night for one cat or dog. Unless her water bill was $2400 more than usual, she got a hell of a bargain having you watch her cat for the cost of some extra showers.", "Nta\n\nBe like sure, I'll pay the water bill when you pay me market rate for house and pet sitting. \n\nThat will silence her. \n\nYou lost out on a LOT of money- avg daily rate in my area is $50 a day for in home pet sitting.", "You had me at \u201cshe is a doctor who does not shower everyday\u201d.\n\nI hope that you mean she doesn\u2019t shower everyday at HOME because she showers at the hospital\u2026 right???\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI'm a pet sitter on the side. I charge as a base rate for 1 to 2 animals 50 dollars a night. My services for 60 days would cost her 3k. You saved her three thousand dollars by offering to do a payed service for free. She is being greedy and ungrateful. If i were you.... I'd bill her the average for per night pet sitting in your area times 60 nights....and offer to deduct the water bill from what she owes you for doing a job that requires you to be away from your own home 25/7 and therefore is expensive.", "YTA. You were clearly taking advantage of your friend by living rent-free for two months without contributing anything meaningful towards the household expenses. Your excuse about needing to use your desktop computer and washing machine is ridiculous - there are plenty of ways you could have handled those things on your own time without costing your friend extra money. Additionally, it sounds like you knew all along that you weren't being fair to your friend by accepting her favor without compensating her fairly. If you truly cared about maintaining your friendship, you would have found a way to contribute financially during your stay instead of putting your friend through unnecessary stress and conflict.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
