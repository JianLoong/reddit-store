{"id": 29441, "submission_id": "17dseo6", "title": "AITA for refusing to go to my best friends wedding after he asked me to be his best man, because he didn\u2019t invite my girlfriend to the ceremony?", "selftext": "One of my best friends has recently got engaged to his girlfriend of 4 years, they will be getting married next year and I was over the moon for them. A few days ago he asked me to be his best man and I said yes, I\u2019d never have considered saying no, but yesterday official invites were handed out and my girlfriend was only granted an evening invitation. \n\nThey said that they were only allowed 50 people to the ceremony and 100 to the evening, and any additional seats will cost them money. If it were a case of the pair of them having huge pools of family and friends and they had to make a cut I wouldn\u2019t feel angry about it but they both have very small families and I then found out that people they met online playing video games have been invited to the day and not only that but their partners have also been invited. It just feels like a bit of a slap to the face, being the best man and not being allowed one space. \n\nThe bride has often said that she doesn\u2019t like new people in her life and my GF has very rarely been invited to social events at their house, though when she first started seeing my friend I made sure she was invited to everything we did from day one. I\u2019ve been with my GF for six months and by the time the wedding comes around it\u2019ll be pushing 2 years. \n\nAnyways I ended up telling my friend that not only would I be pulling out of being his best man, but I wouldn\u2019t be going to the wedding and it\u2019s safe to say he wasn\u2019t best pleased. He tried to explain it rationally with there not being space for her but I stuck to my guns, I know this may make me the asshole because I\u2019m throwing away years of friendship for something that likely wasn\u2019t a huge consideration for them, there just wasn\u2019t enough space, but knowing how this had made me feel, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be capable of giving a nice speech during the day\n\n[EDIT:] thanks for the responses below, I appreciate it seems I\u2019m blowing things out of proportion for a day that isn\u2019t about me, I will do what I can to rectify this with my mate, in the heat of the moment it just felt like a more personal slight. one thing a lot of the responses make clear is that I didn\u2019t make it well known that I\u2019ve been friends with both the bride and groom for the duration of their relationship and due to their joint at the hip nature, and the nature of our friendship group, peoples partners have usually been welcomed with open arms to everything. As I said in my above post I did everything I could to make the bride feel comfortable in the group when she was first introduced, and we consider each other good friends. \n\nThe point of contention with me is more-so that if we were together in a years time when the wedding rolls around I\u2019d like to think she were established in the group, I wouldn\u2019t dream of not asking my best friends partners to the most important day of my life. We are all a tight knit group of friends and see each other regularly (partners and all) it\u2019s just that my partner doesn\u2019t get an invite when it comes to social events hosted by the bride and groom. I know for a fact if the roles were reversed and she wasn\u2019t invited to my wedding there would be hell to pay (because there have been instances where I\u2019ve invited my friend without his girlfriend for \u201clads nights out\u201d and she\u2019s kicked off) \n\nAnyway the point of this edit isn\u2019t to try and convince people that I\u2019m in the right, I can see quite clearly that I\u2019ve over reacted and that things could have been resolved in a different way but I just wanted to give a bit more context into our friendship because it\u2019s not a case of my friend is getting married to a woman I\u2019ve barely met, I class her as a friend and have made every effort to make her feel included from day dot.

It's not like you'd be spending time with your girlfriend during the ceremony anyway since you'll be part of it and she'd be watching.  It's quite logical  based on the couple's guest limits, that your girlfriend would only be invited for the part of the event that she'd be able to interact with you. YTA for backing out on a commitment because they're not changing their wedding to accommodate your demands.", "YTA\n\nYou answered the question in your post. They have limited space and wish to keep the wedding on a budget. It is not for you to decide who watches the ceremony and who doesn't. Your girlfriend has an invite to the evening reception.  It is truly up to the couple on who they wish attends the morning portion and watching them tie the knot.  \n\n\nI bet if you asked your girlfriend if she cares or not Id wager it is the later.

His IRL gf wasn't invited to the wedding but the couples online only friends AND their respective partners were. The excuse was the lack of space for said IRL gf.

Sounds like the bride has an issue with his IRL gf.\n\nOP you are absolutely justified with your reaction. Lack of space for the BEST MAN'S IRL GF is equivalent to a lack of respect for not only your GF, but you as well. Your \"friend's\" fianc\u00e9 has an issue with \"strangers\" yet invited the partners of her online friends she's never met before to her wedding, but not your GF whom she's met multiple times?\n\nYou're definitely NTA. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Ask your \"friend\" and his fianc\u00e9 how she would feel if you and your GF got married and invited him to be the best man but didn't invite his fianc\u00e9/wife (by the time you get married) to the actual wedding? Would she allow him to be the best man? Would he drop out if she was slighted in that fashion? You and I know that answer because she \"kicks off\" (your words) when you invite him out without her. That tells me she actually has very deep control issues. And her not inviting your GF to her wedding is showing you that she has all the control.\n\nAnyhow, you're not wrong.

It's better that everyone knows it now, so in a sense, you did him a big favor.\n\nI actually feel a little bit sorry for you, because I think you'll eventually regret this decision.", "Yta. \n\nI can see them giving those seats to friends and their spouses as they are much more likely to be attending. Your gf of 6 months might be your ex gf in 18 months. And they did invite her. The ceremony is very short in most cases anyways.", "YTA. She's still invited butter into the day. This just seems like an odd hill to die on for a girlfriend of 6 months. Let it ride out, and if you're still together closer to the wedding, I'm sure there will be some wiggle room to make some changes.", "YTA. Just because you feel like you can justify her attendance doesn't mean they have to. You don't get to decide that your girlfriend is more important than their online friends. Don't go if you don't want to, that's you're choice. But I think this is a ridiculous reason to throw a friendship away.", "NTA - They are asking you to spend your time and money to be part of the wedding and most likely events like bachelor parties, tux fittings, etc. the least they can do is respect your relationship and invite your partner. In my mind as a member of the wedding party you should have your partner invited to all events. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t get hung up on the online friends. If they are traveling long distances they may get a ceremony invite to make it worth the time.", "Well, it's a little backwards - usually it's the reception that has a limited number of guests...  \n\n\nBut I do wonder about the fact that you've only been with this gf for 6 months, and the wedding is 18 months away - it's not really certain that you will still be together by then.  \n\n\nI'm not sure that there are any AHs here.", "This makes zero sense.

Why should they invite her?\n\nFor a 6 month old relationship, you are throwing away a life long friendship. I guess simping ain't easy.", "NTA - as the adage goes, it's a wedding invitation, not a court summons. Just as they're allowed to draw their lines where they want in terms of their wedding day, you're allowed to draw your lines where you want in your every day.\n\nSaying that, I can't see this ending well for you in terms of your friendship. And you're banking on a lot here by presuming you're going to still be with your girlfriend of 6 months in another couple of years. Maybe reconsider attending the evening do instead.", "Lol, you\u2019ve been with your girlfriend for six months. That\u2019s really not long enough to feel offended by this as many couples won\u2019t even invite guests\u2019 partners if they haven\u2019t been together 1+ year by the time the invites are sent. I hate to break it to you, but part of your friends\u2019 perspective is likely that there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll even be together by the time the wedding happens, so why would they sacrifice a limited spot at the ceremony for your girlfriend over someone that they know and want there more?\n\nAt the end of the day, it isn\u2019t about you and your reaction probably means the end of your friendship.

The limited plus ones all around because of the location they chose.

Weddings are expensive!\n\nAlso - if this dude was asked to be the best man, a more practical take on this is that he would have been sitting at the head table with the rest of wedding party.

Based on what you've said about who else they invited the gf for the best man should have been allowed without needing a discussion", "ESH he's your best friend but doesn't want your gf there for the actual ceremony (due to space) sorry but I've planned a wedding and you purposely make sure anyone that has a boyfriend/girlfriend/partner has a plus one.

Deaths, people moving, people simply not showing  etc.  I would have encouraged you to ask your buddy to keep your gf on the short list in case others bail.

If it were a case of the pair of them having huge pools of family and friends and they had to make a cut I wouldn\u2019t feel angry about it but they both have very small families and I then found out that people they met online playing video games have been invited to the day and not only that but their partners have also been invited. It just feels like a bit of a slap to the face, being the best man and not being allowed one space. \n\nThe bride has often said that she doesn\u2019t like new people in her life and my GF has very rarely been invited to social events at their house, though when she first started seeing my friend I made sure she was invited to everything we did from day one. I\u2019ve been with my GF for six months and by the time the wedding comes around it\u2019ll be pushing 2 years. \n\nAnyways I ended up telling my friend that not only would I be pulling out of being his best man, but I wouldn\u2019t be going to the wedding and it\u2019s safe to say he wasn\u2019t best pleased. He tried to explain it rationally with there not being space for her but I stuck to my guns, am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good for you that your knee-jerk reaction is for sticking up for your gf. It always is the bride/groom who decides who gets an invite. You don't get special privileges because you're the 'best man' - there is no special parking space with your name on it or a crown to wear. You get the honor to be there on the most special day of their lives because they care about you.

While you're right it's the bride and groom's prerogative who they want to invite to what event, it's a pretty dick move to prioritize virtual friends over your supposed best friend. I don't blame OP for considering backing out.

I don't know about the married couples you know, but generally most people give invites a year or more in advance where I'm from. \nI'm going to a wedding in November that I was invited to 2 years ago lol. \nMostly people do this because the venue they choose tends to be hello expensive and so it takes them time to build up the money but obviously you already know who you want to invite and stuff before 2 years.", "Couples like to plan things ahead of time, even if it's 1.5 years away. It's fine.", "People plan their lives wildly ahead these days. We just sent our Save the Dates out, 11 months before the wedding, and we're already down 20 people due to planned vacations.

You can't win when you're planning a wedding, so I personally think the couple in question here did the logical thing by getting their wishes out asap so people could plan their lives accordingly. Like, two of my bridesmaids have planned entire pregnancies around my wedding. Bride and Groom did the right thing. \n\nAnd the fact that OPs current girlfriend was not included in the ceremony is not a big deal at all. I'm curious if OP is only mad because his new GF won't be there to watch him walk the aisle? If so, relax buddy. She still gets to watch your speech at the reception when you get to ACTUALLY be the center of attention. It's awfully audacious of him to insist she get to watch the most intimate part of SOMEONE ELSE'S wedding, who she currently doesn't even know that well.\n\nI'd also like to mention that these \"internet friends\" are likely traveling with their plus 1s. It's very hard to exclude someone who has traveled a long distance from the full day of activities. Much easier to limit the guest list on the local's side, because an evening out in the city you live in is much more justifiable than an evening out in a city you had to spend a small fortune traveling to.", "It's pretty common for me. I was actually more shocked when I got an invite to a wedding only 3 months before this summer. Most invites I get are for weddings about 1 year away. Especially this year there's a big wave of people who got engaged during covid trying to get married.

Not everyone would RSVP with an additional guest, of course.\n\n\"You can come to the reception, but not the ceremony\" would have been an insult to many.  It may not be an issue to younger folks, but the bride and groom may save even more money than they planned with their tiered-invitation scenario.\n\nAnd the best man is not only a honor, but also a job. Party planning, helping with wedding details, helping keep the wedding day on track, public speaking.\n\nSo for the best man to not have a plus one for the entire event is especially odd to me.  It shouldn't matter if he has a new girlfriend by then that he's only known for 6 months.  He's expected to put some effort & money into this wedding.  His current partner, who is there for all of that, should not be left out.\n\nNTA, OP.", "It's just a feeling, but I don't think that the girlfriend is liked.

They are on a budget and they barely know OP's girlfriend.", "What makes you think another +1 isn't a big deal? Perhaps the ceremony space has a capacity issue? I don't care if it's more than a year out, inviting OP's short-time girlfriend (because that is what she is right now, regardless of how they feel about her) could mean that the +1 of one of their \"internet friends\" has to spend thousands of dollars on travel to sit in a hotel room for half the day while their partner attends the ceremony alone. \n\nHave some perspective. This is not worth blowing a friendship up over.", "So OP is the asshole for deciding they don't want to be best man? Is that what you're getting at, or are you calling OP the asshole for their reasoning?\n\nAfter all, I thought everyone is entitled to decide what THEY want to do.

Therefore OP\u2019s gf would probably just sit there awkwardly and be bored during the ceremony. Or GF could get to sleep in that day, take her time getting ready, and then just drive straight to the reception to have a ball with the BF.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s a 6 month old relationship so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s super well established. Imo the situation would be NTA if OP just talked to his best man about it and explained his feelings. I\u2019m sure the groom would\u2019ve been willing to pay to add her in.

Every wedding I\u2019ve ever been to has more reception guests than day guests. So that fits with what you\u2019re saying! I agree OP sounds British.", "Are you American?", "Exactly!  The bride and groom are going to be so busy with guests they won't even notice any girlfriend anyway.  But she may make the best man's day more special.", "But if going forward he goes NC, that'll make him not a good friend.", "Plus ones are distributed to the wedding party, immediate family, then guests if it's a limited venue. Even if the gamers were invited with their married spouses who the bride and groom have both met and like, which we don't know, not giving plus ones to the wedding party is a huge slight. \n\nDoesn't matter if the wedding party has a 6 month partner, a 6 year partner, or are completely single- they still get a plus one option.", "All we know is they met them online, how the friendship has progressed is left unsaid. They could be meeting up regularly for double dates.\n\n\nAll we can say for certain is when the bride and groom picked who after family etc would be present for the I Do they valued am \"online friend\" and their partner above OP's girlfriend who even OP has explained has no connection to them.", "I definitely see how he feels slighted, but if I try to think about it from the couples' perspective I'd say a) the online friends are likely travelling to be there, sure partners could wait in a hotel room but that's less comfortable than being at home and likely requires extra cab fare and b) OP's gonna be busy, so gf would be alone the whole ceremony. We also don't know how serious the online friend's relationships are. OP has been with his gf 6 months right now. A couple that is married/long term committed is just different.\n\nI mean, I hate ceremonies of basically any kind so admittedly I'd be thinking about this like \"woo! I'm off the hook\" but I still think it's more complicated than you think.", "Where does it say they've never met them? All it says is that they met online", "I mean to some people that may seem insulting but often in really tight knit groups like this SOs will be involved in voice chat in the background or whatever. They're not always \"strangers\". Whenever I am hanging with online buddies on VC when I'm at my gfs place she usually ends up involved in VC a bit. I've met and talked to the kids/SOs/parents/friends of my gaming buddies before while I've been on VC with them. If these are really long term and tight knit gaming buddies with long term relationships there can be legitimate reasons to give them a seat at the reception over OPs gf that he's only been with for 6 months. I am assuming his friends have a much closer relationship with their gaming buddies SOs than they do with OPs gf.", "Good chance the online friends are engaged/married to their partners. Which is different than inviting someone OP have been dating for 6 months. They haven't even seen all the season together. \n\nWe didn't invite any new couples to our wedding unless we were already good friends with both parties and would want them there even if they weren't together.\n\nThe couple is very kind to invite her to the evening festivities.  \n\nOP, YTA.", "Very abnormal. Venues usually require a final guest count a few weeks/ a month before the date. Wedding invitations going out a year and a half before the date is crazy. It\u2019s also really weird that the ceremony is a bigger expense than the reception\u2026", "It depends if you\u2019re maxing your venue out or not, and it sounds like they are. Our venue\u2019s max number of guests was 48, so we knew as soon as we booked we were only having 48 guests.", "Why do we assume online friends aren't important friends? They obviously consider them real friends and we don't need to judge that. A GF of 6 months getting any sort of invite is more then lots of couples would do", "Since when are gaming friend a lower tier friend? Plus we have no idea if the partners OP mentioned are long term partners, wives or husbands? Maybe they are also apart of the gaming friend group and OP is just unaware. It's honestly not a fair comparison for OP to make without providing more context.", "Sure let's pretend you weren't lumping me into your \"biggest joke\" insult first. And just because you don't have the common sense to understand that a bestman is a significant deal doesn't mean everyone on here is a joke.", "I'm saying the bride in the wedding seems to not like the gf, I think she decided that best man's gf wasn't worth a plus one while internet friends are, I hope so anyway.", "He does get a plus one\u2026.she\u2019s invited to the reception. She\u2019s not in the wedding party and the ceremony is small and intimate, there\u2019s no need for her to be at the ceremony. The point of a plus one is to have someone with you at the reception. He wouldn\u2019t be standing with her at the ceremony because she\u2019s not in the wedding party, she would be all alone in a small intimate ceremony, it honestly doesn\u2019t make any sense to invite her to the first part, it would be weird. He has a plus one, once he\u2019s done with his best man duties during the ceremony he can meet up with his girlfriend, and they can sit and enjoy the reception together. This is such a weird thing to be angry about, he literally does have a +1 just not the ceremony where he\u2019s occupied anyway.", "Lmao imaging throwing a fit and backing out of being best man to a close friend because they didn\u2019t invite your GF of only 6 months who they don\u2019t know to only the boring part of the wedding. They literally still invited her and were going to pay for her meal, drinks, the party part and he threw a temper tantrum. Definitely the AH", "It doesn't matter to ME, but if it matters to him, then that's something he needs to decide.  \n\nYeah, but information left out is how well does he know his online best friends?  Are his online best friends married and shit or traveling far? I have an online friend whom I've met his live in girlfriend several times.  I'd invite her to my wedding, but if one of my homies JUST started dating someone and capacity was an issue, it would be a debatable topic.  \n\nYes I've been a best man in a wedding and didn't get a +1.  Was I annoyed? Absolutely. But did I back out of the wedding and start comparing other people who got a plus 1? No, I didn't.  \n\nI'm just saying I've seen plenty of friendships end over disputes involving weddings.  And OP just needs to be sure he thinks this is a worthwhile hill to die on.  keep in mind, SHE STILL INVITED TO THE PARTY.", "1) Lol yeah I can tell his angry and that's my point.  He isn't simply declining, he's reacting out of anger to prove a point.  Which makes him a little bit of an AH to me. \n\n2) yeah my point is he's coming across as petty because someone else got an extra +1 to a 30 minute portion of the wedding he didn't get.  That's how the groom is going to see it.   His friend being an online friend is irrelevant. That's just an attempt to belittle the bond. \n\n3) so if the groom sees your actions as a petty angry response because you're comparing +1s, you are putting tension and risking the friendship.  And I'm just illustrating that OP needs to be aware of that.", "Who are you to judge the bond/friendship the online friends have with the bride and groom?", "Yes friendships are just math equations. Nailed it.", "I understand that it could be like this but again why dont try to know the gf of your bestman better? And I grew up whit the idea of the best friend is your bestman and that groom and bestmann are really close and if I think i am close with my friends but can see that they prefer others than a person that is important for me than i would be unhappy too and maybe also ask if they think different of our friendship than i do..", "Yes", "That's it happiness shared and all that, plus what can she really do during the ceremony but sit there and watch anyway ha ha.", "Yes. What\u2019s your point?", "I disagree. When the bride and groom are on a tight budget (as indicated in the post), you have to try and limit plus ones. Not inviting someones wife or husband is a bigger slight than a short term girlfriend, no matter what role the person is in the wedding. Reception seats/meals are expensive and add up so fucking fast. Just giving out plus ones to single friends as you said just because they are in the wedding party just isnt economical and not a slight.", ">often in really tight knit groups like this SOs will be involved in voice chat in the background or whatever.\n\nThe same bride who 'doesn't like new people'? The one who never invites OP's girlfriend to events OP is invited to?", "I mean the online friends aren't the best man", "I'm not assuming that at all, but if they're exclusively online friends and the bride's reason for the girlfriend not being invited is \"I don't like new people being around\" then inviting the SO of people you've only met online is ... an odd look.", "> Since when are gaming friend a lower tier friend?\n\nI'd imagine if they were 'higher tier' friends, one of them would have been made best man?\n\nIsn't that what the wedding party is? Literal friend tiers?", "They aren\u2019t the best man though", "Im not calling every one here a joke because of this post,its the collective bullshit of 3 years that i have seen on this sub that i arrived at this desicison. And i might have accidentally said you are a joke since im not super good at writing English since im not native speaker sorry for that. And bestman is a great deal,but not as great as you are making it out to be and idk how ur thinkinh works??bestman(for 1 day)>gf(possibly for years)??", "Yeah thats what im talking about too, either the ops friend /friends bride has a problem with gf hence not inviting her.", "Bro they ofcoure will pay for her and for everyone, its wedding and yes he did throw and should throw a fit(not a big one only a small fit) when they didn't invite his gf.It didn't work?? Well he backed out.\nWhat part of this is hard to understand?", "I don't see it even being about the gf. Online friends got more consideration. That's the issue.", "Stfu", "1.ok now i agree, that reacting out of anger is a little bit immature and dumb and a little ah but this is no reason to call op a complete ah.\n\n2.op's view is different and the friends view is different, they both are seeing this in a different way,so it is what it is and they can't even talk out of this cuz the friend already refused and just how much fit can op even throw\n\n\n3.agreed 100% , they are indeed putting the friendship in a difficult position, and op is aware of that, isn't this why he is asking whether he is an a hole or not , but im sure op is not doing this without a reason ,must be some reaction from his gf that he started doing this Right?", "Yeah write who am i to judge?? I am just re-repeating the op's statement, and almost as if the whole point of this sub is to judge, either way the guy i am arguing with is also judging the op's relationship ship with his gf, so why am i  the only one getting scolded?", "Seriously, if ANYONE should get a plus one it\u2019s the best man and the maid of honor, not peepooballs69 from CoD. \ud83d\udc80", "You're making an invalid comparison. His girlfriend isn't going to break up with him if he is the bestman, we don't even know if she cares. OP is the one making a big deal out of something that the girlfriend might honestly care less about, I know I wouldn't mind being able to skip the ceremony and just get to go to the fun party.\n\nOP is risking the relationship he has with his bestfriend over what could be a nonissue for his girlfriend, he is overly sensitive.", "Oh then we agree! I would hope it's not the friend who's asking him to be best man that decided his best man isn't worthy of a plus one though.", "They did invite his girlfriend\u2026.she\u2019s literally invited to the reception. It\u2019s totally normal and fine to have a small intimate ceremony and invite more people to the actual party. People do that all the time. It\u2019s absolutely insane to throw a fit and throw away a friendship because your girlfriend of only six months was only invited to the fun part of the wedding \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOf course, he is allowed to back out if he wants, but the question here is whether or not he\u2019s an asshole, and throwing away a friendship and backing out of something is honorable as being a best man is definitely an asshole move, especially for some girl he might not even be dating by the time of the wedding because 6 months is literally nothing. They aren\u2019t serious at 6 months", "Online friends doesn't = not real friends.  Also are the online friends married? Traveling long distances? Etc.   \n\nI'm just saying I've been the best man in a wedding and didn't get a +1. But didn't walk around comparing +1s.   She also has an invite to the actual reception, does she not? \n\nI've seen plenty of friendships end or get strained over weddings.  OP just needs to understand that this is the path they want to chance.", "Why shouldn't online friends get consideration though? I started playing D&D during the pandemic with people I didn't know, but now I'd call them great friends. We just clicked and all got on amazingly well, and we were all invited to one of their weddings this year. OP isn't seeing it from the couple's side and nor are you if you think they should invite their friend's girlfriend over their own friends. It's ultimately their choice who they want to share that moment with - as it is his to decide not to attend.", "Why? I'm not complaining about anything, I'm just explaining getting emotional and pouty and backing out of a wedding because you're comparing +1s to 10% of the wedding night is a bit extreme.  \n\nIf that's how you wanna act that's fine. But it ain't cute to me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "You are repeating a statement where OP is evaluating who should get an invite to the ceremony over others. He is no authority figure to source/quote. \n\n\nThe couple decides who will be there for that inimate moments. They clearly have a list of people they wish to share that moment with and it does not include OPs gf due to space limitations. Hence her invite to the reception after. If OP can't understand that, that is unfortunate.", "Well ofcourse she won't break up or maybe she will?we can't tell this cuz op didnt provide much information.yes maybe she doesn't or she does?yet again we don't know ,but op is doing this cuz he cares and he cares deeply , so how is he the ahole? I would have understood if op made a big scene out of it , but this isn't that much of a big scene , its just a  best man chill my guy.", "The friend didn't invite her cuz ops not worth of a plus one, but maybe cuz he doesn't like the gf, aren't you contradicting yourself with this statment?", "You don't know how long the op has been friends with him don't you??so the argument of throwing away a friendship over 6m girlfriend is invalid.and when did i not say she wasn't invited? When did anyone say she wasn't invited to ceremony??we aren't discussing the cermony, we are discussing why wasn't she invited at the later part of the wedding.", "The best man is generally acknowledged as the closest relationship. And them being online friends does matter. It means they aren't family. Otherwise, they would be referred to as such. Whether or not +1s matter to you is irrelevant. It matters to op.

I'm saying they shouldn't get +1s before op does.", "Ok so the bestman is no authority figute to source, if this guy is his bestman then he should have some idea and question as to why his gf isn't invited but some randos partner are? He is putting himself over than the randos bcz he must have known his friend and his relation ship with those online friends and the mf couple will be destroyed into atoms of they just can't gey one more person in and that one more is non other than the best man plus one, nah they def hate they gf hence defining ops reaction"]}
