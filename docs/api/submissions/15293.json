You and your brother were 18 when your parents divorced and 21 when your dad met Brian. Your Dad was fully a part of your lives until you were full grown adults. And how has he \"ignored\" you since then??\n\nBrian would \"find out\" that you mentioned he might be \"using\" your dad because your dad would discuss it with him! They are married, seem happy together, and are having a baby, so you DO need to deal with the truth.", "INFO:\n\nOther than \"enjoying\" your father's money, what has he actually done wrong? \n\nBecause, so far, your only evidence that he's using your dad for his money is that they go on trips and out to dinner, which are perfectly normal things for a couple to do.", "Info: what does your dad say when you talk to him about your concerns? Your main criticism seems to be that Brian is \"enjoying the perks\" more than your dad. From an outsider's perspective (mine), seems like your dad was living a lie his whole life and is now fully enjoying this new phase. It feels like you're in Y T A territory and maybe there is some truth to the idea that you haven't quite processed these changes. What evidence do you actually have that Brian is using him? He's not bleeding him dry or convincing your dad to do things he's uncomfortable with (i.e. spend money, have a baby) is he? Have you thought that your dad might be acting like a different person simply because he felt that he had to mask his whole life and maybe the mask has come off?\n\nEdit: I see the question of \"AITA for telling my dad that I can't stand his gold digger husband?\" And, yes, YTA. You haven't given any evidence that he's a gold digger. Sounds like your dad is enjoying his life and spending his money.", "I think YTA mainly because nothing you described is giving gold digger vibes. It sounds like your dad is enjoying his life, his money, and himself. Have you ever thought that maybe the person you knew as your dad isn\u2019t his true self? He was forced to be in the closet because of the times he got married to a woman he ultimately did not love or was ever happy with. Regardless of how great your mom may be. My parents now that they do not have us kids go out more to restaurants and are enjoying the fruits of their hard work. Your dad is doing the same. Maybe he wanted a kid because he never got to have one with someone he loves. It sounds like Brian is right. You haven\u2019t accepted that your dad is gay and that he isn\u2019t the person you thought he was.", "YTA. You asked if you were wrong for calling your dad\u2019s husband a gold digger. Except you went off on your dad about would he abandon this child and ignore it. Your parents announced they were divorcing when you were 18 and going off to college! Did it not occur to you that perhaps your dad wanted to take vacations, eat at fancy restaurants, and redecorate his home? Him enjoying this new phase of his life and being able to live openly doesn\u2019t mean he regrets the choices he made before. Brian is right. You and your brother have taken this very personally. You are acting like your father is an incompetent, senile, old fool being swindled. You do not get to be an adult that cuts their father out of their life and then claim he abandoned you.", "YTA for HOW you expressed your thoughts. There was no need for that. Your dad didn\u2019t abandon you. Your reaction here only helps prove Brian correct to your dad, no matter how sus AF his motives are.", "YTA. You haven\u2019t listed a single thing this man has done wrong, yet you\u2019ve apparently been repeatedly insisting to your dad that he\u2019s \u2018using him\u2019. So what if they\u2019re spending money together? Are you pissed it\u2019ll decrease your inheritance? You\u2019ve described tons of rude behavior on your part, and none on his. \n\nYou seriously do need counseling\u2014 you\u2019re accusing your dad of \u2018leaving you behind\u2019 when he\u2019s done nothing but get married? Hopefully a professional can help you grow the fuck up.", "Info: what were Brian's finances like before meeting your dad? Does Brian work and bring in an income as well? Did he live like this prior to their relationship or only after they started dating.", "YTA. When did your father leave you behind? You went low contact, not him.", "Why am I getting the feeling that this is more about having to split inheritance with his husband and child.", "YTA \n\nLet\u2019s see, you keep accusing Brian of using your dad and he\u2019s rude to you?  Well, obviously he\u2019s being rude to you because you\u2019re being an absolute asshole. \n\nYou\u2019ve accused him of being a gold digger, repeatedly, why exactly do you think he\u2019s supposed to be polite to you?", "YTA - it doesn\u2019t sound like your dad left you behind.  You were 18 & heading to college when the divorce was announced & your concern about your dad\u2019s spending choices seem selfish.", "YTA.  There is nothing in your post to suggest your dad abandoned you, so your hateful comment about his new child was uncalled for. \n\nYour dad sounds happy, but for some reason you seem to feel the need to tear that apart.", "YTA: Your reasons for disliking Brian are vague and quite possibly without any merit. None of the conduct you described sounds that problematic, and there\u2019s nothin inherently wrong with an age gap so long as the younger partner is old enough to not be taken advantage of, and the older partner still has the faculties to make an informed decision. And age gaps are especially understandable for same gender couples, because our homophobic society caused and still causes people to remain closeted or in denial well into adulthood, which pushes the beginning of their dating in line with their sexual orientation much later into life (e.g. your dad). And your dad has made it clear multiple times that he is happy with Brian.\n \nBrian\u2019s responses aren\u2019t entirely saintly, but most aren\u2019t out of pocket for how rude you\u2019ve been to him. The numbers to his friends I think is too far, but too minor in light of your conduct to warrant an E S H.\n\nYour actual response to the baby news was terrible. Especially so if you said those words only to he hurtful. Now if you actually feel that way towards your dad, that\u2019s a valid feeling to have, work through, and tell him about. But not like this.", "YTA. You and your brother sound jealous of Brian. If they make each other happy, then you should be happy for them. Your dad is an adult who should be allowed to make his own choices even if you don't like them.", "NTA. If he thinks he needs to send you \"'tolerance' packets\", and continues to be rude, there's no reason why you can't be open about why you dislike him to your dad.", "YTA. Everyone's marriage is different, and you don't know what your father's marriage is really like. If your dad is happy then I don't see why anything else should matter. \n\nYour dad and his husband wanted to share a happy moment with you, and your response was to say that your dad abandoned you?! When you made the choice to stop visiting?!", "YTA because it\u2019s wild that you are ignoring the fact that your dad willingly has a trophy husband. A sixty year old dates and marries someone half their age knowing full well that the other person is attracted to the financial stability and benefits while they are attracted to the hot young body. Stop acting like he is being taken advantage of. He absolutely knows the score. You don\u2019t have to like your dad\u2019s husband or his choices, but grow up and stop acting like you haven\u2019t also been an adult the entire time this relationship has existed. The inner workings of their relationship are of no concern if they are happy together and you have described two people who absolutely are happy together who you have no reason to be antagonistic towards. You can be embarrassed that your dad is pathetic enough to buy a hot young stud, but that\u2019s the kind of thing you and your brother cringe about privately if you want to maintain a good relationship with your dad.", "YTA. Brian sounds like a high maintenance pill for sure, and I can't say I'd be super fond of him either, but your resentment and obsession about what your dad does with his money are very misplaced. You are an adult but you are acting like a bratty teenager. You can be in your dad's life without being all up in his business and what you said to thier happy news they chose to share with you was unforgivably hurtful. Brian may be wrong about some things, but he might be right about you needing some counseling. Please seek it before shoving your whole leg in your mouth again", "YTA your dad is right and it sounds like you\u2019re not over it and are taking it out on him and his new partner.\n\nDo you know what people who were closeted their whole life want to do, they wanna go out and have fun. They wanna have a good time with someone. They want someone who sees them. \n\nLeave your dad alone.  He\u2019s a responsible adult and he can make his own decisions. \n\nThe fact that he\u2019s formed a family with a child and you\u2019re being so petty but you won\u2019t even be part of it says everything I need to know.\n\nIt honestly sounds more like you\u2019re worried he\u2019s going to spend your inheritance on his happiness", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t really explain any reason you think Brian is a gold digger. So he and your dad go to nice dinners and pricey vacations which you admit your dad can afford. Who cares? It sounds like you probably just don\u2019t like the age difference, which makes sense, but absent some evidence that Brian is cheating on your dad or something you should have just let them be happy together. \n\nI thought about saying E S H over the \u201ctolerance packets\u201d but it isn\u2019t clear what that really means. It sounds like Brian is just trying to defend himself so I\u2019ll give him a pass absent more concrete evidence he did something wrong.", "If I have to choose, then yta. You warned him, you told him your thoughts, now it's time to stay out of it and accept it. And if you're right down the road, then you're right. Whatever they have together, your dad seems to want to keep it going. So you can either choose to stay away, or you can continue seeing your dad and being around Brian without comments on their marriage. Either way you are getting a new baby sibling.", "YTA", "NTA, especially since Brian gets so defensive and convinces your dad you hate him, kinda seems like he doesn't want you exposing him", "YTA", "ESH as your comment was pretty cruel (it's not like your dad has abandoned you!). But Make sure your dad knows that Brian has sicked his friends on you.", "Yeah uh... YTA. Why would you say something like that, it was extra rude. Your dad loves you and you say something like that? He didnt leave you behind YOU chose to leave yourself. Christ.", "[removed]", "I have a question, how old is this Brian?", "Esh you say he's rude but don't provide any examples.  \n\n*You* stopped visiting *him* and then you accuse him of abandoning you?\n\n\nBrian is an ahole for, presumably,  sharing your phone numbers.", "Usually AITA does not approve asymmetrical relationships where one partner, has the money, and is 30 years older. What gives?", "NTA IMO. You made him aware of your concerns, but aren't demanding anything of him. Instead, you decided to distance yourself from something that was bothering you. It doesn't sound like you gave him an ultimatum, just did what you felt was best for you. He pushed and he is your dad, you are allowed to tell him how his behavior makes you feel.", "Hmm, ESH. Some condescending behaviour flying around from both sides here. Between Brian\u2019s \u2018tolerance packets\u2019 and your rude dinner remark it sounds like you both need to get over yourselves and behave like adults.\n\nSome of his behaviour, such as speaking about the divorce and \u2018tolerance packets\u2019 is appalling and demonstrates that the guy clearly does have a bit of a chip on his shoulder and a huge ego, but at the same time you are being rude and assuming things too, and that remark about abandoning/ignoring you was totally uncalled for he sounds like a loving dad, and you seem to have a bit of a chip on your shoulder. It\u2019s not a good look for either of you and you need to stand by your dad, especially when he really needs to know that you\u2019re comfortable with his sexuality, he must have had a really hard time. You and Brian are both behaving like children.\n\nMaybe he is a gold digger, maybe he isn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t like the guy, don\u2019t let your dad suffer for it. He clearly loves you and doesn\u2019t want to abandon you, and I\u2019m willing to bet he wants you in that baby\u2019s life.", "NTA, but close\n\nYour dad is in an abusive relationship, and abusers thrive on using the drama they stir up to get closer to people. What you're doing is, sadly, only going to drive your dad further into his arms. \n\nAnd with the new sibling, none of your dad or stepdad's shit is the babies fault. If you need to be estranged from a half sibling to avoid the abuse, do what you must. Otherwise that kiddo is going to benefit from growing up with a big sis who won't free them the same BS.", "NTA, it might have been a bit harsh but you needed to say what you feel. And if he gave your number to his friends, that is fucking wild and clearly not a good person. Make sure to save the texts and send them to your dad", "NTA. Your father is selfish and delusional.", "NTA- but I think your Dad already knows and does not care. Your Dad chose a much younger partner who obviously has no shame in asking for whatever he wants. So your Dad is enjoying his attention.  Sucks but he is an adult its his money.", "ESH\nTypical reddit. As it's a same sex relationship, the  huge age gap is fine and not at all alarming. It also doesn't bother them he has his friends calling his husband's children to harass them. \n\nHowever, you know your dad isn't going to listen to you because he's enjoying his new life. If his husband is using him, wait it out and be there for him. You don't have to be involved in their new life if you don't want to be, but try to be there for your dad. If Brian is really using him, all you're doing is helping him and giving him ammunition.", "NTA\n\nThis is what he wants & you don\u2019t agree. All you can do is Love him from a distance.\n\nThis post is getting messier, now \u201cBrian\u201d has appeared & is telling his side? This has to be fake", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, but block Brian and all his friends. Tell dad that if Brian and his friends keep harassing you, that you will be going NC with him.", "NTA and for him to give out you  all number is crazy asf.... your brother and yourself were looking out for your dad but he has to realize it and see it for himself...", "ESH, but only slightly on your part.\n\nIf I had a parent who found a new partner and suddenly started spending a ton of money because the partner wanted them to, then I would see that as a red flag, too. The fact that Brian has jumped to manipulate the situation by implying that you and your brother are homophobic tells me that you're probably right that he's a gold digger, and he's happy to drive a wedge between the three of you.\n\nI don't blame you for making that barbed comment. Your relationship with your dad is strained, and instead of wanting to fix it, your dad has bought the manipulation from Brian and decided to start on making a \"new\" family with him instead, and expect you and your brother to fall in line and play happy families? We all snap and I get why you feel abandoned.\n\nWhat you need to do is talk to your dad, just him and your brother, make it clear that you love him and support him being gay, but that you dislike Brian as a person and want to keep a relationship with him and him alone. Drop the money issue, because that's what makes you E-S-H, since you gave that warning and your dad doesn't care. It's his money and his life. Tell him that you're not making him choose, but that you just want time with him alone.\n\nHopefully, he'll understand and you can rebuild your relationship away from Brian. If your dad refuses and demands that Brian be part of it, then he's the one that's chosen when he doesn't need to. Either way, you'll figure out how much your dad really loves you.", "NTA protect your dad from gold digger brian at all cost", "NTA.  Brian is going to take it all and ghost your family as soon as pops passes away.  Sad but true, seen it before firsthand.", "NTA. Your dad is basically saying the first family was a fake and trying to start a new \"authentic\" family. Also, he is just too old to have a new baby.", "ESH. This is tough cause I wanna say Y-T-A for your comment once dad revealed that he was having another kid. Then I thought N-T-A because dad is clearly catering to Brian on the whole having another kid thing. He should be living it up and retiring soon. Instead he\u2019s gonna be changing dirty diapers and raising another kid. That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. However OPs comment was uncalled for and makes me think there\u2019s some sorta unresolved issues there. Because it sounds like you feel abandoned and not like I feel that it\u2019s foolish to bring another child into the word at your age. Brian is an AH for the way he acts towards you and for giving out your number so his friends can harass you. And your dad sounds like a spineless AH. Dad bringing another child into this world at 60? He\u2019ll be lucky to see them graduate high school. So it\u2019s clear that this new kid is for Brian to have a family once dad has passed away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His child will be secure which is all he should want given that he\u2019s married to a much older man whose life expectancy may not make it to the kids graduation.", "NTA", "NTA this is crazy your and your brother could have kids and he wants another.", "NTA because your feelings are as valid as anyone else's.", "I get this and it\u2019s hard. My dad remarried after my mom died and they go on trips around the world and eat at fancy restaurants all the time.  I had to remind myself that he didn\u2019t get to live that life with my mom because kids schedules and then she was sick for a long time before she passed.  I\u2019m really happy for him that he has someone to do that with now, though! And happy that he has someone to push him to do that because he absolutely loves those trips.  It\u2019s hard seeing that it\u2019s not with my mom. I get that feeling.  But he deserves to be happy and do all the things.  Parents, if they can afford to, should absolutely live their best lives after their kids are out of the house, separately or together.  We only get one of these lives (maybe?) so live it up!", "Nta that top comment sounds like Brian found his way to Reddit", "Would your verdict be different if OP wrote \u201cMy parents divorced, Dad went off and found a trophy wife who\u2019s almost the same age as me. Stepmom spends all Dad\u2019s money redecorating the house, going out to fancy dinners & international vacations. Now stepmom is having a baby and wants to play happy blended family, but I\u2019m calling her out as a gold digger.\u201d Because if you change Brian\u2019s gender, that\u2019s essentially what OP wrote.", "> Brian\u2019s friends have gotten our numbers somehow and are calling us TA non stop. So are we?\n\nThe fact that this is happening is making me think Brian is massively projecting.", "If you really are Brian, I'm glad you're not my stepdaddy, lol. I wouldn't want to spend Christmas with you either. If you aren't Brian, VERY convincing roleplay post.", "My spouse is 10 years older than me. When people accuse me of being her trophy husband, I just say think you.\n\nY'know...step-kids don't owe their step-parents love. If you want that relationship, maybe earn it by protecting her from your friends that are harassing her instead of...whatever this is you're doing now.", "You realize that in a sugar baby relationship, if this even is one, BOTH parties are using the other right? The older richer one uses the younger hot one as a status symbol (and for their body, I know it\u2019s your dad but that doesn\u2019t change it) and a trophy and the younger hot one uses the older rich one for their wallet. \n\nIt\u2019s generally a mutually agreed upon thing and both parties consider it beneficial. \n\nYour dad is 60. What sounds like a young fit 60. He\u2019s not a decrepit 80 year old with dementia. He\u2019s perfectly capable of making his own decisions and doesn\u2019t need his daughter deciding he\u2019s not. Sure it\u2019s unusual to choose to have a new baby at 60, but far from unheard of, especially when a second younger spouse is in the mix. \n\nHonestly if Brian was a few years younger I\u2019d think your dad\u2019s the predator. But Brian is 30 not 20 so it\u2019s whatevs (a LOT of maturing happens in your 20s . . . As evidence by, well, you)", "I am with you on this. Reddit goes blind and reverses its stance on things like age gaps and financially imbalanced relationships if homosexuality is involved. Dating someone half your age who is pushing for whirlwind trips is a clear gold digger relationship. If your dad was straight and divorced his wife for someone half his age and Jetset around the world he'd be vilified in an instant. Your dad has a gold digger and is getting a pass on it because he is gay. But he is also an adult so there isnt really much you can do. You said all you can.", "Your entire post comes from the point of this guy enjoying your dad's money making it obvious you aren't over the divorce, at no point in your post do you even make an attempt to explain whether your dad is happy or not, you skip entirely past his happiness for your bitterness that his new husband is enjoying his money, assuming the things they do together are only enjoyed by the husband and not your dad as well, I understand you have concerns but your father is an adult, wether your concerns are what is happening or not you will achieve absolutely nothing by being purely bitter towards his partner, even assuming that this guy is a gold digger you assume your father isn't ok with trading money for love and companionship, if you want to discuss your concerns with him do so in family therapy rather than continuing with this antagonistic attack on your dad's current life, YTA", "It\u2019s so bizarre that people actually think the verdicts would be different. In that situation it would be completely inappropriate for OP to be hostile to her dad\u2019s new spouse and call her a gold digger based entirely on her age. If you\u2019re angry about your dad getting a divorce and moving on, tell it to your dad, don\u2019t take it out on their new partner who has done nothing except enter a relationship with him.", "OP, you are letting his husband drive a very solid wedge between you two.\n\nThis is what he wants.\n\nNAH because I think everyone but OP and his sibling is getting what they want.\n\nDad with the hot new younger husband that\u2019s totally a Flex. Brian with the Found Himself Later-in-Life Husband, and they\u2019re going to try to build a mew family.\n\nI\u2019m sure feels like a slap in the face that he would move on with someone who makes you feel like that. But some let this person totally ruin everything between you and your father. And soon, your nephew and you.", "And who will get the business, brian and the new kid obviously.", "Plus sharing inheritance. \n\nWhat Brian is doing is to diminish OP's inheritance, especially with another kid in the picture. That's why they hate Brian more than ever, and Brian must be having lots of champagne thinking of how he's winning all of this.", "Done nothing but get Dad to spend all his money redecorating, eating out, traveling and now starting a second family when he should be a grandparent bc the trophy wife is his kids\u2019 age?", "Literally none of those things are wrong for him to do. There\u2019s nothing to suggest OP\u2019s dad is being coerced to spend this money in any way. It\u2019s his money and he can spend it with his new spouse however he sees fit.", "Yeah, pretty sure they wouldn't be happy with a stepmother who was only two years older either.", "No, it really wouldn\u2019t. Because that nuke was thrown by their father, not by Brian or Brianna.", "There\u2019s also nothing to suggest that all this new spending ISN\u2019T all Brian\u2019s idea, either. It doesn\u2019t sound like the dad was doing that kind of money wasting when OP\u2019s family was intact, so from their perspective it would obviously be highly suspect.", "Not really.

Clearly it\u2019s an idea OP\u2019s dad, an adult of sound mind, likes.

The issue with age gaps solely revolves around the grooming that can take place when a full-fledged adult starts dating a young adult. \n\nThis is a 30 and a 60 year old.

Be specific. Assuming full mental faculties on both participants.", "It is fine.  Period.", "If it weren\u2019t fine, the problem would be OP\u2019s dad, not Brian.
