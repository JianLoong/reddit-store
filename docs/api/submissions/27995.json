It\u2019s incredibly hard for kids to be taken from their mother. Tell your ex you don\u2019t trust this new girl. Explain that you are only doing what\u2019s best for your child.

Your instincts were right on. Too bad if they are mad. The father should be upset too, are there no standards for him, as to who he allows around his child. Whatever those felonies were, are serious enough she doesn\u2019t have her own children and should definitely not be around yours. I\u2019d file a petition with the court if he has ordered visitation and make them aware of the circumstances. Good for you on protecting your child, don\u2019t feel bad for one second.

As long as you didn't like hire a PI and this was all stuff publicly available or you found yourself from other people your all good.

NOPE. Ex is going to have to make other arrangements to see your daughter because no way would I leave alone with new GF", "NTA. The kid's your daughter and doing a background check on someone who could potentially be around her or in her life is completely valid. You're doing your daughter a service because you want her to be safe. Your ex boyfriend sounds like the AH here because he's not being a responsible parent to your daughter.", "NTA\n\nYour first responsibility is to your child. The felon clearly cannot have unsupervised access to kids and that is for a reason. You are well within your rights to say she cannot have access to your child. Sad that he is stepping down for the little one though.", "NTA. Mad they got caught. And for the best if she\u2019s had her own kids taken from her. A person like that will have NO tolerance or mercy for someone else\u2019s toddler, oh my gosh. Keep her away from them.", "INFO: what does 'background check' mean in this context? Like stalked her insta or used access to government sources?", "YTA. You don't get to tell your exe who he can date, its just that simple. ANd being a \"felon\" doesn't mean much in this country.

The record was not clean. It was found out because the gf didn\u2019t like the toddler over for visitation time which is sus and raised red flags, big ones. It totally warranted investigation. Investigation based on sus situations is also known as trusting your gut.  The lady did right in her actual real, live situation and her baby is better and safer for it. Speculating about non-existent alternate universe judgements where the gf was merely hostile to the child isn\u2019t really the point here.", "I see how there's a bit of hindsight is 20/20 but new GFs behavior did seem suspicious even if that suspicion hadn't panned out.", "Most background checks search public records in the US, which is legal.  It's also legal to ask anyone questions about a particular person."]}
