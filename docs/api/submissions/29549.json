Thing is, those kids are a LOT. All kids are going to be a lot but they don\u2019t have a bed time, stay up till 2 am, talk a lot and are generally loud. Kids do that I know.

Last Saturday night we visited and my mom said yes to babysitting but I interrupted and told her if I was going to be the only one watching the kids they can stay where they\u2019re at. My mom says yes only to sign me up to babysit not herself. I love those kids but I wasn\u2019t trying to spend my only night off watching kids that aren\u2019t mine. I\u2019ve got a life too. I may be the asshole for saying that if I was the sole person watching them, they wouldn\u2019t be coming home with us. I was very irritated though because I knew how the night would go, we would get home and the kids would be all over me tearing my room up.

You\u2019re allowed to do what you want on your days off esp being you only get one off a week.", "NTA if your mother says yes to babysitting she should also be the one to actually babysit them. She cannot say yes everytime and put responsibility on you. You need to talk to them and set boundaries for yourself. As a person who has job and tons of classes later I also get sunday as the only free time, and personally I would want that for me because I know from monday its all work and no rest.", "You are saying it yourself. You are 19, working 2 jobs with just 1 day off. How is it your fault for not having the time for HER kids?\n\nNow I would agree, on occasion having her kids is one thing. But constantly is a different thing, you have your own life to deal with. For that matter, her kid are not even having reasonable behaviors. So I fully agree in not wanting that around you. Your aunt needs to deal with her own kids, she wanted kids now she gets to take care of them as well. That isn't your problem.\n\nNTA. Your aunt and family are however, each in their own way.", "NTA- your mother can watch the kids since she said yes. You were not asked, nor are you paid for it. So no. Not your job or responsibility. And if they try to use the family helps family line then the family member that agreed to it can be the one to help.", "NTA - If your mom wants to agree to babysit them, she can babysit them, not voluntold you for the job.\n\nYou are not wrong for making it clear that if babysitting is happening YOU will not be the person doing it.\n\nWould it be better to have had this conversation prior to showing up at their house? Sure. But you didn't, and of course they're upset - you've upset their comfy applecart where your parents get to look like loving helpful family while doing none of the work. And you didn't martyr yourself. Bad you (not).", "NTA. \u201cNo\u201d should be all you have to say. That everyone is upset tells you they believe they have sitter/you at their demand.", "NTA and your mother and aunt can think anything they want about you as long as they don't try to stick you with your cousins. Just refuse to visit next time.", "NTA, favorite saying lately is No is a full sentence. You don\u2019t volunteer someone for a job period. While I don\u2019t think you are the ahole, you could have handled it better. Knowing what was likely to happen you could have spoken with your parents ahead of time about needing a break instead of causing a minor scene. Also when you say you told your parents they will not becoming home with us that was bold, unless your name is on the mortgage or lease you have no say in who your mom allows in her home.", "Your mom was not respecting you. You are right for being upset.", "Hard to say. But, ahead of your next visit, set boundaries with your family on any terms you have for babysitting to avoid any awkwardness and fallout.", "Nta.  Not at all. You need to sit your mother down and tell her you will not do it again.  Two jobs and school. You have exactly x waking hours in which you have homework etc.  And then reinforce it by having plans. Even if that is to go sit in a coffee shop to do homework.  Till they get the hint", "NTA I think it\u2019s nice that you are visiting them and spending time with them.

Your mom is taking advantage of you. Are you being paid for babysitting? I hope so. Either way, next time she does that I would make plans and then not be home.", "NTA. \n\nI would say you should get a lock for your door, even a temporary one, and then lock your room and don\u2019t have anything to do with the kids", "NTA.  Stick to your boundaries.", "NTA id starting making plans to socialise with friends etc whenever mum decides she\u2019s volunteering to babysit. Maybe after actually doing it herself she\u2019ll learn to say no", "NTA.  Not your monkeys, not your zoo.", "Were you paid? Sounds like you weren't based off the post\n\nAre these your kids? Obviously no.\n\nAre your mom & Aunt parentifying you? Yes- which is a form of abuse.\n\nNTA.", "NTA if your mother not gonna watch these kids she shouldn't volunteer to babysit them.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother shouldn't be signing you up for things without asking you in the first place.  And you are not required to do anything you don't want to do.  I would tell your mother, explicitly, that you won't watch the kids anymore.  Or she needs to ask you first before signing you up.\n\nAlso, I would recommend going out with friends more often, not only for your own well-being, but also so that the assumption that your time is available is no longer there.", "Thank you! I could have for sure been more clear with my mom and aunt that I was super tired and don\u2019t really want to babysit at all, but I got very irritated considering that happens every time.", "Unfortunately, this is a case of the mom brings the cousins home and sics them on OP whenever the whim hits her.\n\nOP, if you're paying rent, remind your mom that you are not her child to order around, but an adult paying bills, just like her.  And if she wants to keep getting rent, she should remember that little nugget the next time she goes to pull this stunt.\n\nIf you're not paying rent, sorry, I got nothing.", "Also just want to add seeing as you are legally an adult out of high school you are living at your parent\u2019s home by their invitation, not legal obligation at this point. I would be careful about making demands on what you will and won\u2019t do while living there. \n\nYour parents may see you helping out family as your \u201crent\u201d mine did. I was expected to watch my sister kids for the hours between them getting out of school and my sister getting off work on the days my mom worked (on average 3 days a week). It was a pain, I was in school, working, and planning a wedding. Ultimately though sacrifices those few hours a couple of days a week was well worth free rent and home cooked meals they days my mom didn\u2019t work. \n\nJust saying be careful about making a fuss, your parents are helping you out now, just as they are trying to help your aunt. It sucks I know, but it is hopefully just not in your control for a little while until you move out. Speaking to your mom respectfully instead of what I am guessing she interpreted as interrupting her disrespectfully is a better strategy to get her to consider your request to have some say in when she invites your cousins over.", "True, I definitely could\u2019ve handled that better. I should\u2019ve also added that I told my mother in the car before we got there that I was super tired and just want to go home afterwards. That should\u2019ve been hint enough to not bring home any kids. I could have been more clear though for sure.", "I actually am not in school yet, graduated high school last year not sure what to do with myself but I am working two jobs. No school still doesn\u2019t free up my schedule enough for me to have the energy to babysit though. I\u2019ll for sure sit my mother down and have a talk, hopefully she will listen but it\u2019s a running theme in my family to not really listen or take any responsibility. So we will see how that goes", "Thanks for clarifying. Consider avoiding future trips to avoid being put in that situation.\n\nQ: Are there special circumstances where the family offers to take the kids. - besides being a handful.  Is this a respite situation where the kids have special needs?", "Ah well how\u2019s a good time to start making your plan to live on your own.", "The kids do not have special needs, I never talk about people\u2019s kids but to put it lightly they don\u2019t listen. Unless you yell at them and I\u2019m not about to yell at some kids that aren\u2019t mine. We do take them a lot though, including their dog when they go on vacation or date night without the kids which is quite often.", "If OP avoids future trips the kids will be brought home and they\u2019ll be expected to watch them.", "Yeah I\u2019ve been taking advantage of living at my parents house and building my credit as much as possible. I don\u2019t have many friends or people I know to roommate with and god knows how expensive it is to live alone. I\u2019ll get there for sure and in the meantime just deal with the bullshit Ive been dealing with for years", "Thanks. You are NTA.", "Meh Building credit? Nah just build your savings.  Do go into debt to build credit. This is your time in life to get ahead a bit. Good to stay at home while you can but don\u2019t hold off on making solid plans for how you will support yourself in the very very near future.", "NTA put your foot down. time they accept you are no longer a doormat they can walk all over", "I just want to know if you did take them home with you? NTA  though", "NTA. Your mother is volunteering you and that's grossly unfair. They're not even your siblings!\n\nIf your mother wants to take those kids then she needs to be the one who watches them.", "NTA though I suggest next time you hide in your room and lock the door.", "NTA. Just leave that day and let your parents deal with them.", "NTA. You have no obligation", "NTA", "NTA. But get a door handle that uses a real key installed . That way they can't invade your room while you are out. Then next time she says yes, lock them out of your room and go out all day.", "NTA. The old people of your family (as many others) believe that is normal to dump their responsabilities on the younger ones, don't cave in, those children are not your responsability, enjoy your free time.", "NTA. Not your kids, not your problems. You\u2019re younger and in a tough position working two jobs but you\u2019ve got this \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb stay strong and hope you\u2019ll find better jobs soon!", "NTA. Did you try to volnteer her time to someone? Try to tell her XYZ asked for.... xyz and you told them she would help. Look for her reaction!!", "NTA go to your room lock the door/Block it with a chair if necessary, put your headphones on and relax. \n\nIf you do this a couple of times I'm pretty sure your mother will learn her lesson", "Of course she needs to build credit.  She is planning to move out.\n\nIf she\u2019s in the US, credit score is one metric nearly all landlords use to screen out applicants and she is looking to move out soon.  If she has no credit score, many landlords will just toss the app.  Or require a cosigner, if they want to deal with that mess.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a record of on time student loan or car loan payments, so getting a credit card and waiting a while is the best way to get a credit score.\n\nAll it takes is Time and using a card responsibly.  Buy groceries or a tank of gas each month and pay it off when the statement generates so there\u2019s no interest charge.  Six month or a year of that raises your credit score from nonexistent to 700 and opens up a lot more apartment opportunities."]}
