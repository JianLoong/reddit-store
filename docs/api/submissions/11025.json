Some details changed ofc.\n\nMy husband and I built a house a few years ago with extra bedrooms thinking it would be great to host family\u2026 now a few years later two of his siblings live with us. For context purposes, the older one pays us rent, but the younger one only contributes very little (utility contribution) because they are in school and we wanted to help them save money.\n\nOnto the issue: I find myself carrying the burden of managing the household for everyone. I am also a mom and work full time so the load is already heavy. \n\nThe older sibling has not contributed to any form of cleaning of the home (or participating in chores) since they moved in. I can count on one hand how many times they have made dinner for the household. Cleaning bathroom? Nope. Cleaning dishes? Nope. Eating our food? Of course. There\u2019s more, but i guess it didn\u2019t bother me as much until the 2nd sibling moved in and acts identically to the 1st sibling\u2026 meaning double the work.\n\nToday I spent hours cleaning out the pantry and fridge throwing away expired crap and brand new bags of Costco-sized food. I just couldn\u2019t believe the amount of work I did today just in the kitchen while also managing a young sick kid and all the things that come with that. I was exhausted, to be frank. But not just from today, it seems like everything just piles up.\n\nI really want them gone, it\u2019s been too many months of living like this, and too many talks and reminders to each of them separately with no changes. When my husband got home tonight I just unloaded on him - my emotions were high, I was very upset and hurt (crying etc), and he basically told me to stop acting like this, this shouldn\u2019t consume my thoughts, and we don\u2019t have to address it now, and he didn\u2019t understand why I was so upset. I just wanted to vent about the mental load of managing so many tasks for so many people, and he didn\u2019t want to hear anything about me being overwhelmed. It\u2019s really hurtful to me to not be able to express myself without being shutdown immediately.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to talk about resolution, or what we should do, literally anything I brought up was responded to with \u201cyou keep going on about this\u201d \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to respond to that? I mean, yeah I\u2019m uncomfortable in my own home, and I\u2019m exhausted, and shit needs to change \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t have to change tonight!!\u201d Sigh \n\nAm I really blowing this out of proportion? Am I the asshole? Please help me.\n\nUpdate\u2014\nI didn\u2019t mean to paint a picture of my husband not helping - he does help. We split childcare responsibilities pretty evenly, but I carry the ongoing to do list in my head and manage it for the entire household. My husband cooks dinner almost every night and does the grocery shopping. He works full time as well with similar hours as mine but makes quite a bit more than I do.\n\nHe said he wanted to talk calmly about the situation in order to figure out how to proceed as to not cause a shitstorm essentially.\n\nI felt like the conversation was going well until a few hours later and he just is sitting and sulking.. telling me that he doesn\u2019t have to address anything at the snap of my fingers - I never snapped my fingers or demanded he do it right this second. He\u2019s prioritizing his own discomfort right now with the situation and still making me feel like I\u2019m blowing this out of proportion.\n\nI fear what this means about our marriage, and I\u2019m honestly really struggling right now.\n\nThank you to the kind redditors who have provided links to helpful information on what\u2019s going on here (bigger picture) I just wish I knew how to fix it all, and wish my partner would show some compassion or comfort right now. He\u2019s not.

Best solution is to sit down with everyone and have a serious talk. Tell them exactly how you're feeling without leaving anything out and tell his sisters that if they want to continue staying there, they need to be fairly contributing to the household chores.

Have a separate talk with your husband and tell him you're not putting up with it anymore.

Have you tried making a schedule -- like sister A cooks every Tuesday, sister B cooks every Thursday, they each clean a bathroom on Sunday?\n\nIf you've tried that and they didn't do it, I don't know what else to suggest.

How is this not supposed to be consuming your thoughts when you spend so much time doing everything for everyone? You don\u2019t have time for anything else to consume your thoughts outside of working, taking care of your children, and cleaning up after the adult children you never wanted. \n\nThis is a huge marital problem. At this point this is not a marriage, this is you bending over backwards to be everyone\u2019s maid and house Mother. I doubt you get any time to yourself anymore, and even if you do I bet you are too exhausted to enjoy a second of it. \n\nIf you left for a week, the household would be in shambles and they would all blame you for it.

That might mean leaving for a while; that might mean just cooking food for you and your actual kids, doing yours and the kids dishes and laundry, etc. while letting the other \"kids\" figure it out for themselves.\n\nWhen you're less tired and upset, you and your husband need to have a serious talk. It's not okay for him to dismiss your feelings. Of course you keep bringing it up; nothing gets resolved. You and your kids need to be his priority, not his sisters. It's yours and his house.
