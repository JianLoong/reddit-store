For context purposes, the older one pays us rent, but the younger one only contributes very little (utility contribution) because they are in school and we wanted to help them save money.\n\nOnto the issue: I find myself carrying the burden of managing the household for everyone. I am also a mom and work full time so the load is already heavy. \n\nThe older sibling has not contributed to any form of cleaning of the home (or participating in chores) since they moved in. I can count on one hand how many times they have made dinner for the household. Cleaning bathroom? Nope. Cleaning dishes? Nope. Eating our food? Of course. There\u2019s more, but i guess it didn\u2019t bother me as much until the 2nd sibling moved in and acts identically to the 1st sibling\u2026 meaning double the work.\n\nToday I spent hours cleaning out the pantry and fridge throwing away expired crap and brand new bags of Costco-sized food. I just couldn\u2019t believe the amount of work I did today just in the kitchen while also managing a young sick kid and all the things that come with that. I was exhausted, to be frank. But not just from today, it seems like everything just piles up.\n\nI really want them gone, it\u2019s been too many months of living like this, and too many talks and reminders to each of them separately with no changes. When my husband got home tonight I just unloaded on him - my emotions were high, I was very upset and hurt (crying etc), and he basically told me to stop acting like this, this shouldn\u2019t consume my thoughts, and we don\u2019t have to address it now, and he didn\u2019t understand why I was so upset. I just wanted to vent about the mental load of managing so many tasks for so many people, and he didn\u2019t want to hear anything about me being overwhelmed. It\u2019s really hurtful to me to not be able to express myself without being shutdown immediately.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to talk about resolution, or what we should do, literally anything I brought up was responded to with \u201cyou keep going on about this\u201d \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to respond to that?

How come you're doing all of this and your husband isn't ? \n\nYou should kick the 3 siblings out or take your kid and go a long vacation.", "NTA. Stop doing for everyone, and just focus on caring for yourself and your children. Or if you can\u2019t stand letting the mess build up tell both sister that they need to start paying a certain amount that will go towards a weekly maid coming in and helping you. You obviously can\u2019t actually just kick them out with no notice because you\u2019re stressed and overwhelmed, but your husband needs to show you some empathy and look for solutions instead of just brushing off your feelings.", "NTA. Best solution is to sit down with everyone and have a serious talk. Tell them exactly how you're feeling without leaving anything out and tell his sisters that if they want to continue staying there, they need to be fairly contributing to the household chores. You have every right to demand this, with or without your husband's consent given that you seem to be the caretaker of the house. Have a separate talk with your husband and tell him you're not putting up with it anymore.

See how easy they think your job is then.", "NTA - It seems this laziness runs in his family. He should be helping around the house too and he doesn't have the excuse that he works because you work too.

I wager that they won't lift a finger to do any cleaning, they will just come to you to complain. You can then turn this back on them and tell them that they're being ridiculous and it doesn't need to be fixed tonight etc. Use his words against them...

For starters, you shouldn\u2019t even be doing childcare alone, since you didn\u2019t spawn the kid all by yourself out of nowhere. Take care of your health, you only live once and you are certainly not their mom or maid. Be firmer.", "NTA. You are stressed out and overwhelmed, and you needed him to be supportive and just listen. I'm so sorry he reacted with zero empathy. Your stress is valid and you're not making a big deal out of nothing. You're dealing with so much and you're at the breaking point.\n\nThe sisters need to help out or get out. It sounds like you've tried to talk with them and nothing is changing. Have you tried making a schedule -- like sister A cooks every Tuesday, sister B cooks every Thursday, they each clean a bathroom on Sunday?\n\nIf you've tried that and they didn't do it, I don't know what else to suggest. You really need your husband supporting you on this so that you can present a unified front.

And from the way your husband treats you, he's your fourth child.\n\nIf you think that your husband is just trying to help his sisters and he isn't a bad person who treats you like ship, then move out for at least 1 month.\n\nIf he always treated you bad and now it just got worse, leave him for good.", "NTA I spent all morning cleaning our apartment before taking an organic chemistry final. So I would like to place an application to move in with you so I don\u2019t have to take responsibility for my adult life either. s/\n\nIm all seriousness now, it is not ok that your husband is dismissing you. How is this not supposed to be consuming your thoughts when you spend so much time doing everything for everyone? You don\u2019t have time for anything else to consume your thoughts outside of working, taking care of your children, and cleaning up after the adult children you never wanted. \n\nThis is a huge marital problem. At this point this is not a marriage, this is you bending over backwards to be everyone\u2019s maid and house Mother. I doubt you get any time to yourself anymore, and even if you do I bet you are too exhausted to enjoy a second of it. \n\nIf you left for a week, the household would be in shambles and they would all blame you for it. So I think you should leave for more than a week and see how everything works out for everyone. Can you go stay with family or friends? You can take the kiddos with you too, I just think it\u2019s time to make a statement and show how much you do and consider if you want to even go back home at this point.", "NTA. Stop doing any of the housework then see if your husband thinks it\u2019s a problems.", "NTA- Time to give him an ultimatum.", "NTA. Stop everything you\u2019re doing.

If that doesn\u2019t work tell him they go or you go.", "NTA - your husband sounds like an enabler to his siblings and woefully unaware of the amount of work you are putting into the relationship/household. If they want to live there, they need to live under your rules. If your husband refuses to hold them to those rules, then he is putting them before your marriage.", "OP should take an extended leave of absence from household chores and grocery shopping.

It sounds like your husband came from a home where mom did everything, and now they're treating you like the mom-which they'll keep doing until you stop acting like one. That might mean leaving for a while; that might mean just cooking food for you and your actual kids, doing yours and the kids dishes and laundry, etc. while letting the other \"kids\" figure it out for themselves.\n\nWhen you're less tired and upset, you and your husband need to have a serious talk. It's not okay for him to dismiss your feelings. Of course you keep bringing it up; nothing gets resolved. You and your kids need to be his priority, not his sisters. It's yours and his house.
