He comes from a large family and made a point early that he wants to celebrate Christmas with them. The past 9 Christmases I have spent with him and my in laws.\n\nI am very big on Christmas presents, I enjoy spending time choosing the perfect gifts that will suite the person and as both of us earn a decent wage, normally spend a good amount on the perfect present. So the past 9 years I have spent a considerable amount of money and time to choose perfect presents for my in laws. They always enjoyed them, however when it was my term receiving their presents, they would always get me something really small and sometimes insulting. Over the years I got: cheap socks (under 2$) with the receipt still attached, clearly opened and used man showergel, discount codes for fast food meals, numerous 5\u00a3 gift cards for different places where I don't even go to (one at a time), some presents I got them for other holidays that were clearly used beforehand, some weird knock off clothes ordered from places like Wish which are tearing apart and might only fit a child and so on.\n\nIn his family there's a tradition that every year a different person opens all their gifts first. This year it was supposed to be me, so I did my normal shopping and decided to also get small cheap presents too for my in laws. I have packed both sets of presents in different boxes and put the main ones under their tree. The plan was to swap them to cheaper ones if I get the same presents again as previous years. And of course I get used stuff again and a gift card for 5 pounds to a local supermarket. So I swapped the presents right in front of them. When they opened them, they got insulted and started having a go at me for swapping the presents and demanded the \"proper ones\" which I refused to give back and hace explained my reasoning, which they found stupid. Now I want to point out that my in laws are not struggling and previously they have gifted their 16yo daughters bf a console, when they have been together for 3 months, and everyone else gets significantly better gifts then me, even if I was in their family longer. \n\nChristmas ended early and we had to leave. My in laws are calling me an asshole, Mark is trying to stay out of it but he has said I shouldn't have done what I did.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1672839499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1033ws8/aita_for_swapping_my_presents_to_my_inlaws_with/", "score": 2004, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just go with cheap stuff from then on, in fact, re gift them the stuff they give you  each year.", "NTA but you\u2019ve got bigger problems than Christmas gifts. \n\nYeah your in laws are jerks but it\u2019s your HUSBAND who is the real problem here. He should have stood up for you years ago and intervened with his parents about why they\u2019re demeaning you by giving only you crappy gifts. And in front of everyone too! So mean and disrespectful. \n\nAnd what\u2019s up with your husband demanding that every Christmas is with HIS family?? Do you get a say in any of this?? \n\nI\u2019d be having some intense conversations with my husband about boundaries, loyalty to the marriage and respect.", "NTA they had it coming. Stop buying them anything other than $5 gift cards to McDonald's. \n\nHope the gifts you kept are at least something you like \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd shame on Mark for not standing up for you prior to this. It's been years of this nonsense. He should have had a discussion about this bs a long time ago with his parents.", "NTA and do the same every year.\n\nWhy is your husband not backing you up here?\n\nBuy a budget shower gel next year, use some of it then wrap it up for them.\n\nThey can get as good as they give.", "NTA but just keep the crap they gave you and regift it to them next year.", "I was going to say that your are the ahole, because gifts are not transactional. But holy moly, your in-laws SUCK.\n\nNTA - love that you stood up for yourself. They clearly  carry some weird grudge against you, and tbh if your husband doesn't see a problem with the gifts they give you... Not a good look.", "NTA. (I really, really wish there was a \"Justified\" option, lol.) Was it petty? Absolutely. Was it deserved? Eff yes. That said, you don't just have an in-law problem, you have a husband problem. \n\nYour in-laws have made it perfectly clear they don't care about you by the Dursely-esque gifts they have been giving you for almost a decade. They expected you to keep taking it, and your husband not to step up and say how rude that was, because he has already taught them that he's not going to stand up for you. (I'm going to go out on a very long limb here and take a wild guess that HE'S not getting pre-used presents and regifted his own gifts?) So you took matters into your own hands and told them enough was enough, and that if they're going to be either uncaring or purposely rude enough to continue treating you this way at Christmas, that you will stop putting in any effort, as well.\n\nAs for Mark, he needs to tell his family that their treatment of you is inexcusable and stops now. And that if they continue to behave in this passive-aggressive manner, you and he will both be spending Christmas with your family from now on. Remind him that when he married you he vowed to put you first, and that includes before his parents, so if he can't do that, he's welcome to move back in with them - permanently.", "NTA but that\u2019s a lot of effort for people who don\u2019t like you. Also why is your husband letting them treat you like this and subjecting you to go there for Christmas knowing your going to be disrespected. Gifts are about the money they are about the effort and clearly they picked their gifts to show you they don\u2019t care about you. Look at your marriage and check if it\u2019s worth it", "NTA\n\nThey are such huge A Hs that I would be largely impossible for you to be one by comparison.", "NTA love that you swaped before their eyes!", "NTA but as others have said - your husband is an issue here as well as the in laws \n\nDoes he get them separate gifts to yours?", "NTA but rather not swap it in front of them, i'd pack the cheap ones first, and only if i got something decent this time i'd gift them the main gifts as well", "NTA - I know that feeling... This year I got an ice scraper (I live where we get snow/ice maybe once a year) and my kids got about $40 worth of a couple gifts (from in-laws) All while everyone else got Airpods, beats, shoes etc. hundreds of dollars spent on each grandkid. To say I was pissed is to say the least. I feel your pain. I would rather get nothing at all, than be made a mockery of in front of everyone.", "NTA. I saw you mentioned your were trying to make a point and clearly wanted to get a reaction out from them and you did. However if this had been going on for 9 years, I would\u2019ve started buying cheap gifts come year 3-4 since it would be clear to me then nothing was going to change.", "NTA. I am embarrassed for your in laws, and your husband is kinda TA too.", "NTA. Return the level of energy you are given. They had their chance. While the timing was off, it did send a message.z \n\nNext year, split the difference. Generic gifts that are nice, no real thought or energy. Think fruit basket. Wine. Etc. \n\nYou need to talk to your husband and tell him your perception of events. \u201cWhen your parents give me a $2 socks with the receipt on it, show me that could give two shites about me.\u201d \n\nWhy should you show effort, consideration etc to those who don\u2019t have any for you?", "NTA\n\nBut your husband should of said something years ago", "NTA...it was an asshole move, to be sure...but I'm thinking it was necessary to make the point.  Desperate times and all that lol.  They are ADULTS and know exactly what they are doing when they give everyone else normal to great gifts and you are getting a  \u00a35 grocery gift card.  (Like...what were they thinking they were getting you?  A sandwich?  For Christmas?)", "My main question is: WHY ARE YOU STILL ATTENDING CHRISTMAS THERE?! Seriously. Your ILs have made it clear that they view you as less than.  Your husband is choosing sides by staying \"out of it\". I'm not going where I'm clearly not wanted, so from now on, I'd be spending Christmas with my own family.  After 10 years of mistreatment, I'd throw the whole family out.  \n\nNTA.", "Nice move girl. You had nothing to loose and BAM you showed them. Cheap a/holes they are. NTA", "NTA. Haha. This belongs in some other revenge based sub as well.", "Your in-laws are TA here and while the way you went about things was questionable - they need to show you some respect (especially since you mentioned they only treat you this way).", "NTA. \n\nLet Mark budget for the Christmas and he can now buy his family gifts with zero input from you. That or leave the nice gifts in the car and give duplicates of what you have received in the past as gifts.  If once you have unwrapped yours you can decided on whether they get the nice ones. \n\n\nSeems this Christmas they got the gift of karma", "Just go to your family and let mark see his. I also would be insulted if after 10 years I was getting junk while they expect the \u201cgood gifts\u201d. NTA", "Stop buying presents for them altogether. His parents, his responsibility and even better it's been 9-10 years with his parents time to go spend time with your side of the family.", "NTA, and don\u2019t listen to anyone telling you otherwise. You\u2019ve put up with their incredibly rude behavior for 10 years. Enough is enough already. They deserved a taste of their own medicine. Good for you. I don\u2019t think your husband is much better than they are for allowing it to go on for so long, though.", "NTA. You've had years of this and your husband has stood by and watched it. They clearly intended to humiliate you again.", "Nta. Gift around and find out? Fuck around and gift out?\n\nBut seriously, no need for the swap, just buy them shitty stuff for the next 10 years at least to catch up", "INFO\n\nHow is your relationship with them otherwise?  Do they snub you? Are they rude?\n\nAlso, I have to ask if you're from a different culture than them? This feels like some kind of malicious bias.", "NTA lmfao. Petty? For sure.. however\u2026 they were giving you used gifts? Minimal amount gift cards? Men\u2019s soap? Really? You switched them out in front of them which is the only thing that\u2019s complexing, petty power move but they were giving you degrading gifts for years which is infinitely worse. It\u2019s giving \u201conly because we have to\u201d vibes rather than the thoughtfulness that you deserve for the effort you\u2019ve giving through the years. \n\nI need to know\u2026 what were the petty gifts & what were the original gifts?", "NTA They don't like you and have been showing you this FOR 9 YEARS!  Your husband is a HUGE problem for letting this go on as long as it has.  Do not waste your energy or time getting them gifts ever again and just regift what they gave you.", "NTA\n\nthey have been showing you how they feel about you for 10 years. Stop buying them nice gifts when they get you cheap and opened/used stuff.", "NTA. Your in laws and husband suck. Especially your husband tbh. Major red flag he isn't defending you. It's his family and you're his wife, so it is his problem. Please don't apologize to them for growing a spine and finally standing up for yourself. You definitely need to talk with your husband about allowing his family to treat you like trash, he has no excuses.", "NTA but why are you buying them anything? Put your husband in charge of buying his family presents. If they end up getting nothing because he didn\u2019t do it than oh well. If you\u2019re getting things like used shower gel, I would loudly announce that I\u2019m gonna go put this back in the bathroom for the owner cause gifting used shower gel is gross.", "Apparently they don't like you. I don't know the reason for that, it is out of context. You are NTA. They can't expect getting good gifts when they give you bad ones. They also are hypocritical and think you are stupid, gaslighting you into giving them \"proper\" gifts. But why? They deserved the pettiness you showcased for them fully, for this reason.", "NTA, well done!", "NTA but where is your husband in all this? Why is he letting his family do this for years and years? This seems like a hill he should've been dying on a long time ago", "Nta. I\u2019ll allow it. I hate the idea of gift swapping because it\u2019s an arms race. You end up spending too much or too little and it\u2019s a whole thing. Generally if I want something I\u2019ll buy it. I\u2019m a grown man. I get the idea of gift swapping but rarely do you get something you want and then you end up in the politics of the gift giving like this. \n\nIt seems to me they are scammers especially when they demanded the real gifts. They know what they got you and knew it was not appropriate. In turn they got equal things but DEMANDED more. That\u2019s madness. Next year just op out.", "Hahaha I applaud you. Passive aggressive (or aggressive aggressive) but NTA", "You are NTA. Your husband is YTA for continuing to subject you to this behavior", "Well you should have led with the cheap gifts. IF they would have been an Improvement you could have told them it was a prank and given them the other ones. If not let it continue.....", "NTA\n\nThat was a boss move, switching the presents right in front of them. \n\nMark isn't staying out of it - he has said you shouldn't have done what you did. He has taken his parent's side. Why doesn't he have your back?", "NTA. Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it.", "NTA in my opinion. To your in laws \"you reap what you sow\" \n\nBut I am curious, what we're the \"good\" gifts and what did you swap them for?", "Wait stop for a moment, you\u2019ve spent the last 9 Christmas with them because your husband made a point he wants to do Christmas with his family? What about your family? Are they close and around? \n\nYour husband says you shouldn\u2019t have swapped gifts, yet for the last 9 years had a front row seat, watching you be treated terribly and never talked to his family about it? Now his reaction to stay out of it? \n\nAs Reddit likes to say, you have a husband problem.\n\nThis is a classic ESH- a gift should be given from the heart and not transactional and the gifts they\u2019ve \u201cgifted\u201d you are insulting. \n\nNext year I would put my foot down and on Christmas and you two go to your side of the family.", "NTA, but just don\u2019t bother getting them anything nice anymore. They clearly don\u2019t value giving you nicer gifts based on what they receive, so just get them ones you feel are proportional. I don\u2019t get putting up with the disappointment you feel 9 years in a row.", "NTA \nI would have been more surreptitious with the swapping, let\u2019s all do cheap af presents.", "HAHA NTA   \ndont even need to ask dude", "NTA. Fuck them. Next year, get them coal.", "NTA but you shouldn\u2019t have swapped the gifts in front of them. Though overall you get what you give, so fair game.", "NTA forget it\n\nstop giving them gifts altogether. Let your husband choose gifts and sign them from both of you. And don't expect even cheap socks. Or if you get some next year, I would passively escalate to \"discreetly\" throwing it in the trash. No need to bring that bad vibes home with you.", "Curious if you've raised this with either them (in a joking way or seriously) or your partner, who could've said something on your behalf perhaps to hint you aren't thrilled?\n\nAlso, does your partner get equally bad things?\n\nAs it stands, going with an NTA here based on pretty simple reasoning - they routinely bought you naff gifts.\n\nIf you can't ~~stand the heat~~ be fair and provide nice gifts when you've no reason not to, then ~~stay out of the kitchen~~ at least give them money. Or something.\n\nCould be they just don't like you, or are terrible at getting nice gifts - but I'd go with a good bargain that they aren't going to do it again without looking like prats.", "Did you ever talk with mark about it? Why didn't you just started getting them the same they get you years ago?\nNta, they deserved it.", "NTA and good for you. You put a lot of effort into it every year and they could give two craps to put any effort in their gifts to you.

Good for you!", "Info: What the fuck is wrong with your husband and why do you let yourself be treated like that?", "ESH - but I\u2019m down with what you did. Is it AH-ish? Absolutely!

YES.", "Info: why do you give separate gifts to them from the gifts Mark gives?", "ESH for the stunt as you knew you were going to get cheap presents from them. That many years of the same thing? Come on.\n\nYou should have just downgraded their presents to the standard they give you years ago. That way if they just quietly accepted them, no harm done. If they made an issue that their presents were better the year before, well that's when to call them out on their entitlement. \n\nThey suck because clearly its not a money issue that you're getting what you are, based on what you said about the console. Yet they expect the 'good' presents from you year on year.", "i don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t change your gift giving style after the first christmas you spent with them? like you wasted your own time and money willingly and for what?? lol ESH.", "Kinda ESH for the stunt. You should have just quietly downgraded their gifts years ago if the disparity was bothering you. \n\nI\u2019m curious as to why you were buying the presents for your in laws anyway?

Why even bother going to spend Christmas with his family every year when they treat you as an afterthought?  Let him go by himself, and you spend Christmas with your own family (if possible) or start a new tradition of treating yourself to whatever makes you happy during the holiday.  BTW, your husband is an AH for not sticking up for you the first time it happened and setting his family straight.", "NTA \n\nAnd you should not have bothered buying the nice stuff either. 9 years of insulting gifts, these people will not change.", "NTA\n\nYour in-laws are purposely telling you through the gifts that they hate you.\n\nYour problem with your in-laws is insignificant though compared with the fact that your husband is a giant AH.

You deserve better.", "NTA. \nStop spending so much energy 6 MONEY on people who are not worth it. You don't have to accompany your husband to spend Christmas with his family.  Go somewhere where you will feel welcome.SMH.", "Nta. But in the future if your husband wants his family to have gifts for any occasion he needs to go out chose them, buy them and wrap them himself. If they don\u2019t like the present just point them to your husband. If they don\u2019t get anything then you redirect them to your husband. That that extra time, money and effort and buy yourself an extra present", "NTA. The only way in which you are in the wrong is that it took you nine years of these insults to finally stand up for yourself.\n\nYou handled this perfectly. They knew you would be opening first and still regifted you junk, despite your history of being thoughtful to them, and their own history of being good gift givers to one another. Their reaction shows that they felt entitled to insult you and still have the benefit of your careful consideration.\n\nYour husband is another issue - why has he never stood up for you when his family insults you like this? It's inappropriate for him to stay out of his when it's his family doing this to you, and you have given up the past nine Christmases to be insulted by his family like this every single time. He needs to have a conservation with his family about how they treat you. His silence up to now is telling them this is okay with him.", "ESH, more so your inlaws though.  Clearly you knew that they were going to give you crummy gifts again so you only brought the two sets of gifts to prove a point.  What you should have done is just not buy the thoughtful/expensive gifts to begin with and not make a big production out of switching out the gifts in front of everyone.  I definitely understand that it hurts when people give you such crummy presents, especially when it\u2019s just you while everyone else gets nice and thoughtful gifts, but you were asking for confrontation with this.  If you were really upset you should have tried speaking with your in laws privately, and not about how you want more expensive gifts but how it feels like they don\u2019t value you based on their gifting history.  Sorry but I think you mishandled this one OP.", "NTA.", "ESH. They\u2019re garbage, obviously, but you did this in front of them to cause drama.

Did Mark know you were going to swap out gifts beforehand if you got crap?   Has he ever talked to his parents about why they do this?   You might have a Mark problem if answer is no to 2nd question", "ESH.\n\nThis was VERY strange to have multiple sets of presents to give and then base giving them on what you received. Even with the background info, the best thing to have done was just give them cheaper stuff to begin with if you were so worried about tic-for-tac. You made yourself look disingenuous when that wasn't necessary. I think that makes you an AH. There's no sound reasoning for them gifting you cheaper stuff but you decided to make a stink about it in front of them instead of just reciprocating their gift giving behavior. However, their entitlement to the 'better' gifts makes them AHs imo.", "ESH - they already were AHs for the shitty gift giving, but you woke up christmas morning and chose violence.", "ESH- buy a gift and give them the gift.  It should not be dependent on what they give you. Making your Christmas transactional and then switching them out to prove a point makes you an AH.\n\nThat said, giving used soap is very insulting. I would have a word with my partner and see what the heck is going on there. In the future, just don't get them anything if it bothers you so much.", "ESH. You could choose to rise above and either just give smaller gifts or have a honest conversation on how the gifts make you feel, both very valid, but you went with petty.

You cannot in front of them tell them you are giving them shitty gifts. What\u2019s the point of even giving gifts at that point?\n\nAlso, this all seems a bit entitled. This is not a business transaction. They are literally called gifts. They exist on their own. If you don\u2019t want to give them good gifts because you don\u2019t like them, then don\u2019t.

If you don't like the level of effort someone is putting into their relationship with you, then you can speak up, adjust your own level of effort, or walk away from the relationship.

This year it was supposed to be me, so I did my normal shopping and decided to also get small cheap presents too for my in laws. I have packed both sets of presents in different boxes and put the main ones under their tree. The plan was to swap them to cheaper ones if I get the same presents again as previous years.

People resell gift cards all the time.", "Damn. That's cold.", "My old job handed out blank $50 gift cards one year because the HR woman never loaded any of them \ud83d\ude43. She also almost got the company in trouble for giving us $500 gift cards for bonuses to avoid taxes", "Get the gift card with the dollar amount on it, like say $25, then use $22 of it. \n\nThen gift to the in-laws. Guaranteed they won't check that they are full before checking out.", "You would spend every Christmas for the rest of your life just doling out spite?", "Exactly so. Price is one thing, but even for cheap gifts people should be thinking of what the other person would like. One year I gave my brother socks. Orange patterned socks, as gaudy as I could find, because he had just got into his college of choice, and it has orange and black as it's colors. A relatively simple gift, and not that expensive, but one that he loved and used it lots. For me that's what the gift giving should be, things that show that you cared, and was thinking of them", "Oh, they totally had it coming\u2026I can\u2019t believe it took her nine years to do this!", "exactly what i was thinking.  It seems he's ok with this since he gets lavish gifts.  I think you're NTA but your husband is for not standing up for you with his parents.  9 years of this?  I'd stop going, who needs the humiliation in front of everyone year after year.  If your husband doesn't show you respect then get some self respect", "And as has been said many times before, we don't need a justified asshole verdict because if it's genuinely justified, it's not an asshole move. \n\nIf it's still an asshole move (i.e. if it wasn't actually necessary/upped the stakes and increased drama), then it's a revenge story - and revenge stories aren't allowed on the sub, because there are other subs for that.\n\nThis wasn't an asshole move. This is OP simply deciding to lower the value of her gifts to people who don't value her - and giving them one final chance to prove her wrong before she enacts that decision fully. \n\nOr do you really think it's assholish to refuse to gift luxuries to people who only ever give you used toiletries in return?! No. They set the dynamic, and OP has belatedly decided to give up trying to be loved by them and acquiesce to the dynamic they set long ago.", "But not this time.", "For **NINE** years too!\n\nNTA", "This was my thought exactly. They could put more effort into knowing what OP likes... after 9 years it shouldn't be that hard. This screams 'you're not welcome' to me.", "My in laws have given me the equivalent of what they give their children every year. Even when we celebrated with my family, they would still send us gifts. Part of that includes an ornament (or two) every year that they typically open on Christmas eve. While we only had one Christmas together before we got married (and they didn't get me anything that year because 1- I was with my family and 2- they barely knew me, so I didn't expect anything, my parents didn't get my husband anything either because he visited after Christmas) I have always been included. They even get me stuff for my birthday which is really thoughtful. My parents do the same for my husband.", "My first Christmas with my husband's family, his parents gave me an absolutely gorgeous necklace it was real silver (I love silver, and prefer it over yellow gold, hands down) with real diamonds and stones! I was floored and didn't expect it at all! We'd only met a hand full of times prior to Christmas.. every year since, they get me something to keep me warm! Ngl I'm down for it! I'm anemic and am always freezing.. my husband will sweat at just the mention of temps over 50 \ud83d\ude44 \nI literally hit the in law jackpot with my MIL & FIL... I'm beyond grateful for them, the accepted me and my 5 kids and have had our backs the same as they have their son & daughter & biological grandkids..", "Burn it all down, I say.", "Well she's from a family that doesn't celebrate Christmas but celebrates new years instead in her comments....so yup!", "The worst part is that every family member chose to get a crappy gift. If they all put those $5 together they could have gotten her an Amazon gift card with a decent amount for her to buy something nice. Just plain meanness.", "> They haven't celebrated Christmas before due to their religion and have only started doing it after I joined\n\n> I (28f) have been married to my husband Mark (30m) for 7 years, together for 10. He comes from a large family and made a point early that he wants to celebrate Christmas with them. The past 9 Christmases I have spent with him and my in laws.\n\nThis really doesn't check out for me. You're together for 10 years, and you spent 9 Christmases with them, but only started after you joined?\n\nI guess I could see why he's so desperate to spend Christmas with his family if he was cut off for years. He definitely has issues in that department and should seek therapy rather than try to win their affection at any cost, as neglected children often do.", "Sounds like the definition of insanity", "it sounds petty but i'd keep a list what they got for everyone, even go back and then review the list with your husband and ask him how he doesn't see the disparity and how he just does nothing.  \n\nMaybe next year he can tell them that if they do this again, it'll be the last christmas with them since he won't put up with them disrespecting you", "NTA but are male per chance? I\u2019m getting vibes here", "He either doesn't care or has no balls, sadly neither option is good. You are entitled to feel how you feel and if you want this resolved you're going to have to ask him why he doesn't value your feelings.\n\nGood luck.", "I would just save your Xmas gifts and re gift them back the next year.", "Why did your husband insist on spending Christmas with his family if they had never celebrated it?", "Then should refuse his gifts and say if you can't treat my wife equally, then I don't want your stuff either. But of course he doesn't be he doesn't actually care that you're being treated unfairly.", "Are you and your husband giving them joint gifts? If so, next year, give them something small from both of you and leave it at that.\n\nOr you could circumvent it all and do an exchange. In my husbands family we all(adults not kids) pull names which have a wish list. We have a set budget and you buy off the list and a gift card for the difference(if you don\u2019t spend the full amount). This way each person gets something they want and all are equal value. Then we guess who had whom. This works well when you have limited budget, and insures each gets something they will enjoy.", ">This is OP simply deciding to lower the value of her gifts to people who don't value her - and giving them one final chance to prove her wrong before she enacts that decision fully\n\nThat would have been achieved by putting the crap presents under the tree and keeping the good ones in reserve. Swapping to shitty gifts while they watched was designed to provoke the exact reaction that OP got.", "After the first one, I would have learned my lesson and kept my distance.  The fact that the husband is fine with it is disgusting.
