His wife and I get along fine but I hate that she is always around and I never get one on one time with my brother. When I go to their house she is always in the living room with us and the kid. I know its her house too but I wish she would give us guy time and go to another room when I am over. When he comes to visit my parents and me he always brings her you get the point. He always busy with work the kid or her.\n\nBefore their kid they always used to go to this beer expo that is held a few times a year. It would be a big group with their friends and me and it was always fun obviously they haven't gone since they had their kid. I got the email that its happening again in three weeks and sent the email to my brother asking if he wanted to go. He said it sounds fun and he will get back to me.\n\nHe called me up later and told me that they were in and he purchased tickets for the three of us. I was pissed I thought it would just be the two of us and assumed his wife would stay home with the kid so he could have a day off. I told him as much. He told me sorry but him and his wife haven't has a fun day out in forever and our mother agreed to take their kid for the day and overnight and they were looking forward to it. He also said this beer expo was always something they would do together and they have been going together for years just the two of them before they started inviting the big group so its kind of their thing. I told him forget it find someone eles to take the third ticket. I told him I'm sick of his wife having to be included in everything.  \n\nHe told my mom and she is telling me to grow up. My brother texted me and told me he found a friend to take the ticker but he was giving me one more chance if I wanted to come or not before he promised it to them. I told him to give it away and he said fine and we haven't spoken much since.

Getting pissed about this and telling him you are sick of his wife to be included in things makes you the A. \n\nYou should have been specific. Then he could have made his choice.

It's almost as if your brother is married to this lady.", "YTA. Why would you even think to ask him to not bring her to something THEY always did together? And your response here was pretty immature.", "Yta and here\u2019s why.\n\n1. You knew this expo was their thing. Why would it be a surprise that he would bring her.\n2. Yes they are married with kids and have been together for sometime, they are partners.\n3. I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t asked him to do something 1:1 so your lack of communication makes you TA.\n4. You acted like a child when he told you she was coming.\n\nMy twin and my brother and myself are married. We do a lot of things with our spouses. However when we want sibling time we communicate to each other that it\u2019s time for a sibling get together, no spouse or kids.\n\nI\u2019m with your mom, grow up and talk to your brother!", "You're honestly perturbed that whenever you go to your brother's house that his wife and kid are there?

Instead you called your SIL his whole ass WIFE a burden. She comes before you he said vows and everything or were you not there?", "YTA. Your brother sounds like he\u2019s in a loving and happy marriage. He is CHOOSING to spend time with his wife. My husband and I would rather do things as a couple bc he works all day and kids have sports in the evening so if we spend time doing things with other people we rarely see each other. You don\u2019t get to dictate how he spends his time. He is choosing to spend time with you and to do that and not miss out on time with his wife...he includes her. (Unless you think there is abuse going on and one of them refuses to let the other have friends/family time without the abuser so they can monitor everything. Then that\u2019s a different story.)", "YTA you should have communicated it before that you would like more guy time rather than acting like an asshole to your brother and his family", "YTA.

If you want some one on one brother time then ask him, don\u2019t chuck your teddy out when he quite naturally included his wife in the beer expo plans. Way to alienate them both.

You felt the need to include the fact that your brother and his wife live together and that she (gasp) is at her own home when you visit, out in the open and not barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen or something. You don\u2019t even call his child your niece or nephew, just \u201cthe kid\u201d. \n\n\nYTA and I think there is a typo in your age.

Your brother is married, they have a child together. His family is his priority, and rightly so. And yes, I understand you are his family, too. But the reality is, things change with age. Marriage is a choice and it involves shifting priority to your own generation and the next (if you are contributing to it in the way of children). The family you grew up with is on the back burner, that's how life is designed. We grow up and move on. \n\nMaybe tell him you feel like you've been left behind or that you miss him.

Anyways since it was an event they did do together I see why she would want to go. I would suggest you talking to him and tell him that you just want to hang out with him and it\u2019s nothing against his wife, just you two not being able to do something together with out his wife for some time now.", "NTA it's understandable that you want to have one on one time with your brother. Maybe try to communicate that you just want bonding time", "YTA. If the beer expo was something you and your brother used to do together then sure it makes perfect sense to go together. But it\u2019s something he and his wife have shared for years! Don\u2019t you have something that y\u2019all share?! If not maybe you could find something.

It would have been fine to tell your brother you'd like someone- on- one time with him and suggest a particular outing. But you apparently didn't put it that way, and telling him after the fact that you don't want his wife along is very offensive.  And if he tells you his priority is getting some adult time with his wife - you need to accept it.\n\nYou might be able to fix this by apologizing to both of them and explaining you like to spend time with them but miss occasional one on on time. You made what could have been a positive into the negative of wanting to exclude her. But you also might have burnt this bridge.  It.may be that right now his.priority is his own family and work.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA\n\nYTA dude\n\nEdit: if you want to spend one-on-one time with your brother, you need to open your mouth and use your big boy words to ask for that. You need to call him and say, explicitly, \"Hey, I miss having one-on-one guy-time with you. Is there a time that would be good to do something? I'll plan it; just let me know what fits into your schedule.\" And then pick something that isn't one of his and his wife's traditional dates.", "Yea YTA this is something THEY did together and you never asked if it could just be you two.

Now whether he is able to work that into his life is up to him, but you making plans and assuming she won't be there, then throwing a fit when you find out she's coming is not the way.", "I understand where you are coming from, but you shouldn't have assumed. \n\nIn the future, maybe be clear about your expectations - \"I think this would be fun to have a brother/boy's night out\" etc. \n\nYTA here and how this was handled, never assume anything and just be clear about what you want and expect.", "YTA\n\nGrow up and act your age OP. That whole rant screamed 'pick me'... How biazarre", "YTA.  Your mom is right - you need to grow up.", "NTA\n\nYou miss your brother being in your life as a brother.

I think the most hilarious part of all this is how you want her to go into another room\neven though you recognize it\u2019s also her house. Let me tell you something bud, if my husbands brother or friends EVER had the balls to tell me where to be in my own home they\u2019d get ripped a new one by both my husband and myself. If you want alone time with your brother, ask him out for a drink just the two of you to catch up, to throw a hissy fit that he invited his wife to a group activity is ridiculous. You sound like a child.", "In this situation, YTA. I recommend you talk to your brother and tell him that you miss \u201cbrother time\u201d. Ask if a couple times a year the two of you can plan a guys day.

If you want one on one time with your brother then you should communicate that to him and his wife so they know how you feel. Don\u2019t cut her out of everything but plan some bro time every once in a while.", "Yta - you picked the EXACT WRONG day.", "Did you even mention to your brother that you want guy time, or do you just wait and see if he can read your mind and get pissed off when he can't?\n\nYTA dude. Learn to communicate.", "YTA.\n\nHis priorities changed, naturally.  His wife and child will now ALWAYS come before you.  It's been over a decade now, you should be adjusted to this.  I would suggest you go out and find friends and or hobbies that you can enjoy on  your own, like most adults do.", "INFO: Are you dating? Married? In any kind of relationship at all? Because you sound super jealous. \n\nYTA.", "You are totally allowed to want some one-on-one time with your brother. However, you need to sit him down and tell him that explicitly instead of just getting angry when it isn\u2019t the the 2 of you. \n\nApologize to your brother, tell him you would enjoy some bonding time with him, and then try to plan it accordingly. \n\nYTA", "Look, I understand wanting one on one time with your brother, but have you ever had an actual conversation about it? It sounds like this has all been building up in your head, and you resent him for having a family that you are not a part of. \n\nYTA, though I know you're not meaning to be. I think you should apologize,  and say something like \"I know you're married and have a kid now, and I'm happy for you, but I miss you, and would love to do something together just the two of us. I like your wife and all, but I miss my brother.\" And see where that goes.", "YTA. Listen to your mother and grow up. Brother's got a wife and a kid now, so needless to say you're not exactly top of the totem pole in terms of priority.", "YTA. I kept having to check your age as you act as if you\u2019re 8. Next time you want to spend time with just your brother, include that in the invitation. Don\u2019t assume he should \u201cknow\u201d his wife is not invited. \u201cHey, I have two tickets for the game.

Grow up and communicate with your brother that you want one on one time. Also you even pointed out you picked an event an event they did together before their kid and apparently before inviting everyone else. He also knew his wife needed a day being child free. You are 28 not 8 and know how to use your word instead of throwing a tantrum.", "YTA.\n\nI'm over here laughing in \"SIL who yeets her child towards the spouse and his siblings for a weekend\" because my BILs adore hanging out with the spawn too. Guess what? As long as they aren't juggling chainsaws or going to an actual bar, they seem not to despise/avoid the current tiniest family member or see it as problematic that they are around in general. \n\nAnd in terms of \"giving him a day off\" - in this situation, OP's brother/my spouse seems to want to include their spouse in the day away from the kiddo. Because adult time drops dramatically when there are diapers in the house. And sometimes, people *like* the people they married. Shocking, I know!", "YTA for how you've approached it -you were right to express how you feel but the me or her type ultimatum was never gonna work. Why not give brother the option to do one on one stufc with you another time? If he declines, you really dont have rights to his spare time", "YTA. Have you ever bothered to ask him if he wants to do a guys day?", "YTA simply for allowing yourself  to grow so much resentment, you need to communicate with your brother that you would like to plan one on one time with him. Your brother is not a mind reader and he has his own family he has obligations to. You also need to accept that as a married couple they will more than likely be together. Not only that, they have a child to care for.  Stop being a child and have an actual conversation about what kind of relationship you want with your brother.", "YTA. i understand wanting to spend time with your brother (im the same way with my older sister) but you need therapy to accept that y'all are adults and won't always be able to have one on one time.  he literally has a family. maybe ask if you and him can just hang out but don't be disrespectful to his wife and child.", "YTA. This was THIER thing that YOU were invited to as the extra not hum just bringing her along.  Now you are trying to take it away and pretend that she is the interloper when its you. Asshole", "YTA. You should have used your words and said \u201chey big brother can we do something just the two of us?\u201d and you shouldn\u2019t have expected it to be the beer festival if they always go together. That was dumb honestly", "Info:  at any point in time since they\u2019ve been married have you said \u201chey bro let\u2019s have a brothers day?\u201d If not then, of course he\u2019s going to bring the woman he married to all family and friend events. Are you new here?", "YTA get over yourself, you\u2019re an adult", "YTA\nTake your mother advice", "YTA\n\nWhile you're well within your rights to want one-on-one bonding time w your brother, the way you're going about achieving that (or really not doing so) is wrong. You need to just tell him you want to have some time to the two of you. Trying to take over smth he did w his wife (without even telling him you wanted to go without her and why) isn't going to fix the problem.\n\nDo you have a problem w her? Do you just miss him? Figure that out and COMMUNICATE. You're an adult.", "YTA, you tried to take an activity that he and his wife do together and make it sacred to just you. Also, and I hope your sitting down for this: people in healthy relationships like spending time with their SO. It\u2019s generally considered one of the better ones.", "Dude he's having his own family and grow up and communicate (with elegance) what you want instead of this childish bull. YTA big time", "Nta he should be able to have time alone with his brother.  Just because you are married you don't have to be glued to the hip with each other.", "YTA look it\u2019s fine to want some 1 on 1 time with your brother, but it\u2019s unreasonable to expect that his wife won\u2019t be at family functions or in her own home when you\u2019re over and it\u2019s especially unreasonable to assume that you would get 1 on 1 time at an event that they\u2019ve always done together. They\u2019re married. They\u2019re going to spend time together. She\u2019s his family and has every right to be where her husband is. \n\nI suggest actually talking to your brother when everyone is calm and neutral and say that you miss getting bro time with him and ask how you could working out some time to hang out that\u2019s just the two of you. \n\nBut you also fully need to get over yourself and realize that she will be around most of the time because she is emotionally and legally a package deal with your brother.", "YTA.\n\n\"Hey bro, I'd love to spend some time with you, just you and me. Can we plan something?\"\n\nIt's not that hard.", "YTA. Grow up. They\u2019re married.", "Say to your brother \u201chey it\u2019s been a while and I\u2019d really like to spend some one on one time with you.\u201d", "I love how OP put \u201chas been with his wife for 11 years. They live together\u201d. Lol. Yeah no shit they live together. Even though OP fails to realize that his brother has a family that comes before him, I\u2019m gonna say NAH. OP just needs some maturity.", "Obligatory something something something art room post", "Close call, INFO. Have you ever communicated with your brother that you want solo time with him? \n\nIt seems like you say a lot about assuming things would be as they had in the past or that it'd be just you and him, even when you go to their house, but I don't see you ever saying something like: \"Bro, I want to spend time with you. I see your wife, your kid, and everyone else, but we haven't done anything or just had a conversation, you and me, since [insert presumed painfully long duration]. I was upset about the beer festival because I get that you're married and a father now, but I thought it was just going to be us - it's hard to hear that not only did you assume yet again it's going to be the three of us, where I feel like the third wheel sometimes, but then you just plain replaced me going. \n\nYes, we're adults, and yes, we've got lives, but I like spending time with you, and it's frustrating and hurts that I feel like I have to tell you that that's important to me.\"", "I agree. And, just be specific about any time he wants to hang out. Not in their house, obvs, but, like, just invite your brother out to the bar to watch sports for an afternoon, specifying that you want to hang out just brothers? He isn\u2019t a mind reader, and it probably hasn\u2019t clicked that he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of 1:1 time because it\u2019s his literal family. If he\u2019s invited to their parents house OF COURSE he\u2019s going to assume that all of them come, why on earth wouldn\u2019t he?! He\u2019s ten years older and at a very different stage of his life, his priority isn\u2019t his little brother.\n\nAlso, OP needs to stop referring to his nibling as \u2018the kid\u2019 - I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d particularly want to spend time with my sibling if they wanted to pretend my child has absolutely no relation to them whatsoever. \n\nOverall, OP is acting like a spoiled 11 year old that wants their cool older brother to take them out for the day.", ">It\u2019s something they used to do together so it\u2019s not weird of him to assume she would also go. \n\nAlso (I say this as a beer-loving wife with a toddler, so that's my bias) - the brother would be a *total* fucking asshole if he asked his wife to stay home from this. It's one of \"their\" historic couple events, they haven't been in years, and they have a willing overnight babysitter - the planets truly aligned and OP is really not picking his battles well here. Just ask him out for a man-beer some other time!", "THIS! OP just assumed it would be the two of them when nothing in the history of this event would suggest such a thing. \n\nStop assuming, OP, and use your words. YTA.", "I had to scroll up and double check the ages. Imagine my shock that op is 28, I was pretty certain he was 14 going in 18. \n\nI\u2019m seriously confused OP, you have literally never gone to this thing with just him - you go with both of them and their friends\u2026 but this time you just expected just him? \n\nAnd, I see you complaining that he keeps bringing his wife and life partner to family events and she has the nerve to hang out in her own living room with you. But I don\u2019t see where you\u2019ve said, \u201cHey, Bro, I\u2019d love us to do something just the two of us you up for a bros night out?

If he wants alone time with his brother he should invite the brother and the kid out somewhere outside of the house to give the wife a break\u2026\n\nAlso OP why don\u2019t you and your brother go in another room or outside instead of expecting the wife to coop herself up in another room of her own home.", "The audacity! And to have kids too?", "Jumping on the top comment to say\u2026 he isn\u2019t an AH for his feelings. He\u2019s an AH for how he handled this. \n\nMy mom often wants time with just her kids. No spouses, no grandkids. So every other month, we have girls night! \n\nI get wanting 1 on 1 time with your brother. But it doesn\u2019t have the be the beer expo.

He is just so childish about it.", "Did you ever discuss going on a trip somewhere the two of you? I imagine it would be hard to pull herself away from normal life to have a true vacation with you if she is still in her normal environment. Or does she prefer to not have time away from her kid? \n\nEither way, I'm glad you guys were able to come to a place where you're both ok with how things are. Maybe in the future you can come up with creative ways to get sister time that makes you both happy :)", "Also: who are you to assume that this thing he always did with his wife that he hadn\u2019t gotten to do\u2026.would not include her? Your mom is right: grow up. Your brother\u2019s life doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "Exactly.

YTA)", "Hahahaha im dying love it!", "Yep, considering they've been married since OP was 17 about 14-15 was probably when his emotions got frozen at his brother daring to have a gf....

So annoying just go away pls.\"", "My sister and her husband do EVERYTHING together.

We do the fake polite air kiss and enquire about bs pleasantries. But thats the exent of it. So I just stopped hanging with them outside the family gatherings.

It sucks, but marriage changes priorities.", "I genuinely don't understand why people struggle this hard to talk to their loved ones. How hard is it to communicate your desires?

Not the beer expo. That ship has sailed.", "Yes, she says we can talk freely in front of him and he doesn't mind. They are both very dependent on one another.

Like you said, accepting it is the best you can do at this point.", "Yes?  Maybe she likes visiting with OP too.  Maybe she thinks OP likes visiting with the kiddo as well, since he's not saying otherwise.\n\nAnd what is \"let the kid be there too\" supposed to mean?  You make the kiddo sound like a dog being let into areas it doesn't belong.", "Obviously you're not going to discuss the same topics you would if a kid is there, seems pretty obvious to me", "Is it weird to want privacy with a brother? He may not feel comfortable talking about certain topics in front of his SIL and his nephew, and the fact that his brother doesn't understand that is weird", "Like what?  Never had that problem any time I visited my sister or when she visited me as the kiddos were growing up.", "Then why doesn't he suggest they go out? Or communicate? He is a guest, and she is not obligated to leave because he doesn't like that his brother is married."]}
