I know its her house too but I wish she would give us guy time and go to another room when I am over. When he comes to visit my parents and me he always brings her you get the point. He always busy with work the kid or her.\n\nBefore their kid they always used to go to this beer expo that is held a few times a year. It would be a big group with their friends and me and it was always fun obviously they haven't gone since they had their kid. I got the email that its happening again in three weeks and sent the email to my brother asking if he wanted to go. He said it sounds fun and he will get back to me.\n\nHe called me up later and told me that they were in and he purchased tickets for the three of us. I was pissed I thought it would just be the two of us and assumed his wife would stay home with the kid so he could have a day off. I told him as much. He told me sorry but him and his wife haven't has a fun day out in forever and our mother agreed to take their kid for the day and overnight and they were looking forward to it. He also said this beer expo was always something they would do together and they have been going together for years just the two of them before they started inviting the big group so its kind of their thing. I told him forget it find someone eles to take the third ticket. I told him I'm sick of his wife having to be included in everything.  \n\nHe told my mom and she is telling me to grow up. My brother texted me and told me he found a friend to take the ticker but he was giving me one more chance if I wanted to come or not before he promised it to them. I told him to give it away and he said fine and we haven't spoken much since.

Getting pissed about this and telling him you are sick of his wife to be included in things makes you the A. \n\nYou should have been specific. Then he could have made his choice.

It's almost as if your brother is married to this lady.", "YTA. Why would you even think to ask him to not bring her to something THEY always did together? And your response here was pretty immature.", "Yta and here\u2019s why.\n\n1. You knew this expo was their thing. Why would it be a surprise that he would bring her.\n2. Yes they are married with kids and have been together for sometime, they are partners.\n3. I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t asked him to do something 1:1 so your lack of communication makes you TA.\n4. You acted like a child when he told you she was coming.\n\nMy twin and my brother and myself are married. We do a lot of things with our spouses. However when we want sibling time we communicate to each other that it\u2019s time for a sibling get together, no spouse or kids.\n\nI\u2019m with your mom, grow up and talk to your brother!", "You're honestly perturbed that whenever you go to your brother's house that his wife and kid are there? The nerve of them for living there.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.  This wasn\u2019t a thing you two used to do together that he\u2019s now trying to shoehorn her into.

Instead you called your SIL his whole ass WIFE a burden. She comes before you he said vows and everything or were you not there?", "YTA. Your brother sounds like he\u2019s in a loving and happy marriage. He is CHOOSING to spend time with his wife. My husband and I would rather do things as a couple bc he works all day and kids have sports in the evening so if we spend time doing things with other people we rarely see each other. You don\u2019t get to dictate how he spends his time. He is choosing to spend time with you and to do that and not miss out on time with his wife...he includes her. (Unless you think there is abuse going on and one of them refuses to let the other have friends/family time without the abuser so they can monitor everything. Then that\u2019s a different story.)", "YTA you should have communicated it before that you would like more guy time rather than acting like an asshole to your brother and his family", "YTA.

If you want some one on one brother time then ask him, don\u2019t chuck your teddy out when he quite naturally included his wife in the beer expo plans. Way to alienate them both.

I\u2019m not too interested in going anymore but can we do something soon?\u2019 rather than lashing out it would have been fine. \nI\u2019m single & I love my friends SO but it does suck when girls night turns into me third or fifth wheeling.", "YTA.

You felt the need to include the fact that your brother and his wife live together and that she (gasp) is at her own home when you visit, out in the open and not barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen or something. You don\u2019t even call his child your niece or nephew, just \u201cthe kid\u201d. \n\n\nYTA and I think there is a typo in your age.

Your brother is married, they have a child together. His family is his priority, and rightly so. And yes, I understand you are his family, too. But the reality is, things change with age. Marriage is a choice and it involves shifting priority to your own generation and the next (if you are contributing to it in the way of children). The family you grew up with is on the back burner, that's how life is designed. We grow up and move on. \n\nMaybe tell him you feel like you've been left behind or that you miss him.

Anyways since it was an event they did do together I see why she would want to go. I would suggest you talking to him and tell him that you just want to hang out with him and it\u2019s nothing against his wife, just you two not being able to do something together with out his wife for some time now.", "NTA it's understandable that you want to have one on one time with your brother. Maybe try to communicate that you just want bonding time", "YTA. If the beer expo was something you and your brother used to do together then sure it makes perfect sense to go together. But it\u2019s something he and his wife have shared for years! Don\u2019t you have something that y\u2019all share?! If not maybe you could find something.

It would have been fine to tell your brother you'd like someone- on- one time with him and suggest a particular outing. But you apparently didn't put it that way, and telling him after the fact that you don't want his wife along is very offensive.  And if he tells you his priority is getting some adult time with his wife - you need to accept it.\n\nYou might be able to fix this by apologizing to both of them and explaining you like to spend time with them but miss occasional one on on time. You made what could have been a positive into the negative of wanting to exclude her. But you also might have burnt this bridge.  It.may be that right now his.priority is his own family and work.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA\n\nYTA dude\n\nEdit: if you want to spend one-on-one time with your brother, you need to open your mouth and use your big boy words to ask for that. You need to call him and say, explicitly, \"Hey, I miss having one-on-one guy-time with you. Is there a time that would be good to do something? I'll plan it; just let me know what fits into your schedule.\" And then pick something that isn't one of his and his wife's traditional dates.", "Yea YTA this is something THEY did together and you never asked if it could just be you two.

I could helpeth to maketh this happen by being quite flexible in my time so that it is most convenient to you, as I realize with mine two eyes that your life is full of other things.\u201d \n\nBut then again, I said to myself, maybe he has been cursed by a wizard and is unable to communicate such simple things.", "This.", "The kid is a total a hole for living in the house. Rofl.", "I\u2019m confused by this too, at first I was like \u201cwell I can get that you want to spend some quality time with your brother, maybe you don\u2019t want to talk about stuff in front or her\u201d even though I\u2019m sure itd get back to her anyway. Haha and if that was the case.. he could ask to talk to his brother in private or ask to spend some quality bro time tougher. \n\n\nBut like it sounds like he can\u2019t even stand her presence at like all. Like she could be in eyesight and OP would be upset because shes \u201calways around\u201d", "\"Honey, my brother is coming over. Can you and the kid hide in the bedroom please? The sight of you offends his delicate constitution.\"", "This exactly. It\u2019s totally cool to say \u201chey can we hang out sometimes.\u201d But to A) to assume that something he had always done with his with would just be boys is crappy. B) he chose to spend the rest of his life with this woman. Of course she is going to be around most of the time. \n\nOP - YTA put on your big boy pants and apologize. Tell your brother you miss him and would love for the two you to go out one on one now and then. As for the rest, grow up.", "It flat out sounds like he resents his nephew as well.", "He's not an ass for wanting his brother's wife to leave the room when he comes over?", "I call that a mantrum\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I think he is the AH for how he responded.", "*Well\u2026 If cant have you to myself, IM NOT GONNA COME!  SO THERE!  Mweh!*.", "...it was him and his wife's thing. Why would he not bring her?", "*That freeloading brat needs to know his place!*", "yeah I hate beer but I definitely want to go to beer fest. It sounds fun and like there will be soft pretzels and if I find those fun fruity beers I can drink or not and be the DD.", "Completely.  The way he refers to him as \u201cthe kid\u201d you would think a jealous child wrote it. I had to do a double take to make sure he was 28", "Not really, no. \nImagine the same thing happened with a friend, if they were to always bring their partner around, no one would find it weird if you eventually get tired of having their s/o around without having invited them", "That's not quite the same thing though.  OP is the guest in the house, not the wife.", "I'm talking about when he goes to their house. He's literally mad she's there. And the beer expo was their thing and he's mad the wife is there for it. I don't know about you, but when I go over to my friends' houses I don't get upset that their partner is also there", "He's not mad she's at home, he's mad that she sits with them and the kid too, never leaving them 5 minutes of privacy", "He's not mad she's at home, he's mad that she sits with them and the kid too, never leaving them 5 minutes of privacy", "> I know its her house too but I wish she would give us guy time and go to another room when I am over.\n\nNo he's literally mad she's there. What if they have a small place? Why does she have to leave? Dude can't be bothered to communicate and is mad that his brother's wife is around"]}
