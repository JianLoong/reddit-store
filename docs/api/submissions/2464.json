His wife and I get along fine but I hate that she is always around and I never get one on one time with my brother. When I go to their house she is always in the living room with us and the kid. I know its her house too but I wish she would give us guy time and go to another room when I am over. When he comes to visit my parents and me he always brings her you get the point. He always busy with work the kid or her.\n\nBefore their kid they always used to go to this beer expo that is held a few times a year. It would be a big group with their friends and me and it was always fun obviously they haven't gone since they had their kid. I got the email that its happening again in three weeks and sent the email to my brother asking if he wanted to go. He said it sounds fun and he will get back to me.\n\nHe called me up later and told me that they were in and he purchased tickets for the three of us. I was pissed I thought it would just be the two of us and assumed his wife would stay home with the kid so he could have a day off. I told him as much. He told me sorry but him and his wife haven't has a fun day out in forever and our mother agreed to take their kid for the day and overnight and they were looking forward to it. He also said this beer expo was always something they would do together and they have been going together for years just the two of them before they started inviting the big group so its kind of their thing. I told him forget it find someone eles to take the third ticket. I told him I'm sick of his wife having to be included in everything.  \n\nHe told my mom and she is telling me to grow up. My brother texted me and told me he found a friend to take the ticker but he was giving me one more chance if I wanted to come or not before he promised it to them. I told him to give it away and he said fine and we haven't spoken much since.

Getting pissed about this and telling him you are sick of his wife to be included in things makes you the A. \n\nYou should have been specific. Then he could have made his choice.

It's almost as if your brother is married to this lady.", "YTA. Why would you even think to ask him to not bring her to something THEY always did together? And your response here was pretty immature.", "Yta and here\u2019s why.\n\n1. You knew this expo was their thing. Why would it be a surprise that he would bring her.\n2. Yes they are married with kids and have been together for sometime, they are partners.\n3. I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t asked him to do something 1:1 so your lack of communication makes you TA.\n4. You acted like a child when he told you she was coming.\n\nMy twin, my brother, and myself have spouses. We do a lot of things with our spouses. However when we want sibling time we communicate to each other that it\u2019s time for a sibling get together, no spouse or kids.\n\nI\u2019m with your mom, grow up and talk to your brother!", "You're honestly perturbed that whenever you go to your brother's house that his wife and kid are there?

Your brother sounds like he\u2019s in a loving and happy marriage. He is CHOOSING to spend time with his wife. My husband and I would rather do things as a couple bc he works all day and kids have sports in the evening so if we spend time doing things with other people we rarely see each other. You don\u2019t get to dictate how he spends his time. He is choosing to spend time with you and to do that and not miss out on time with his wife...he includes her. (Unless you think there is abuse going on and one of them refuses to let the other have friends/family time without the abuser so they can monitor everything. Then that\u2019s a different story.)", "YTA you should have communicated it before that you would like more guy time rather than acting like an asshole to your brother and his family", "YTA.

If you want some one on one brother time then ask him, don\u2019t chuck your teddy out when he quite naturally included his wife in the beer expo plans. Way to alienate them both.

Your brother is married, they have a child together. His family is his priority, and rightly so. And yes, I understand you are his family, too. But the reality is, things change with age. Marriage is a choice and it involves shifting priority to your own generation and the next (if you are contributing to it in the way of children). The family you grew up with is on the back burner, that's how life is designed. We grow up and move on. \n\nMaybe tell him you feel like you've been left behind or that you miss him.

Guys night out once in a while, go to a sports bar or whatever it is yall get up to. \n\nBut to demand that his wife not be involved in a tradition that was theirs long before you were involved?

Anyways since it was an event they did do together I see why she would want to go. I would suggest you talking to him and tell him that you just want to hang out with him and it\u2019s nothing against his wife, just you two not being able to do something together with out his wife for some time now.", "NTA it's understandable that you want to have one on one time with your brother. Maybe try to communicate that you just want bonding time", "YTA. If the beer expo was something you and your brother used to do together then sure it makes perfect sense to go together. But it\u2019s something he and his wife have shared for years! Don\u2019t you have something that y\u2019all share?! If not maybe you could find something.

It would have been fine to tell your brother you'd like someone- on- one time with him and suggest a particular outing. But you apparently didn't put it that way, and telling him after the fact that you don't want his wife along is very offensive.  And if he tells you his priority is getting some adult time with his wife - you need to accept it.\n\nYou might be able to fix this by apologizing to both of them and explaining you like to spend time with them but miss occasional one on on time. You made what could have been a positive into the negative of wanting to exclude her. But you also might have burnt this bridge.  It.may be that right now his.priority is his own family and work.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA\n\nYTA dude\n\nEdit: if you want to spend one-on-one time with your brother, you need to open your mouth and use your big boy words to ask for that. You need to call him and say, explicitly, \"Hey, I miss having one-on-one guy-time with you. Is there a time that would be good to do something? I'll plan it; just let me know what fits into your schedule.\" And then pick something that isn't one of his and his wife's traditional dates.", "Yea YTA this is something THEY did together and you never asked if it could just be you two.

Why didn't you COMMUNICATE to him that you want to plan a special outing just for the two of you,band why on earth would you just ASSUME that he would go without his wife to an event that BOTH of them used to attend years ago? That was a bad choice of event for this anyway. You are being incredibly childish here, dude.

However, it is totally unreasonable to expect your brother to assume that when you have never vocalized it.

If you want one-on-one time, you can ask him for that, but understand that that for him, that would require offering similar non-kid time to his wife and therefore is costly to him and would have to compete with anything else he is interested in doing without his kid around.

YTA", "If he wants one on one time with his brother then he should ask for it.\n\nHe isn't the asshole for wanting one on one time. He is the asshole for not telling his brother that he missing spending time with him and wants to do things just the two of them.", "This is why OP is the AH in my book. He didn't communicate and then he got upset at his brother for not reading his mind. He has never once stated that he had talked to him about wanting one on one time before. And when bringing up the beer expo, he didn't mention wanting it to be just them. Since their trips to the beer expo were *always* all of them going, though at first it was just the brother and the wife, it makes sense that without OP clarifying, all of them would be going like they normally did.", "How's the mother in the wrong?", "I agree that couples should be able to have lives as individuals as well, but OP didn't tell his brother that he wanted to just spend time with him and now he's pouting about it. If this is something his brother and his SIL did before they got married it shouldn't be that surprising that his brother invited his wife along.", "Here's where OP became an ass in my opinion: he never once mentioned to his brother that he wanted one on one time with him. OP has made it clear that he never once communicated that need *until* after the tickets were bought when he threw a fit about the situation. And when it comes to the beer expo, it was the brother and brother's wife's things first, and then they all started doing it as a group. Without OP explicitly saying that he wanted to go to it with just him and his brother, of course his brother is going into it with a \"the three of them\" mindset because they've always gone either just the brother and wife or as a group. OP did not communicate what he wanted despite knowing the typical precedent for the beer expo. If the precedent hadn't already been set, I could understand giving OP some slack, but the wife has *always* gone to the beer expo because it was her and her husband's thing, so why would they assume now is any different without OP telling them?", "He's literally mad that she's in the house she lives in", "I can only imagine how OP treats his girlfriends (if he\u2019s ever had any)", "I thought the same thing when he kept referring to him as \"the kid\" he needs to grow up and learn to communicate", "My little sister refers to my two kids as \u201cher favorite people.\u201d He doesn\u2019t need to show that kind of love, but he could\u2019ve been a little nicer!", "Has he even explored foster home options?

That's why we decided to have them at my house actually- she doesn't have to make dog care arrangements when she leaves for the night since her hubby is there. So when that came up someone would've had to go an annoying distance to one of our houses to take care of a dog. We didn't want to make someone have to do that just so we could hang out, so rescheduling was the easiest thing to do for everyone.\n\nAnd I was totally joking about him being dead to me. Lol he's a great guy and makes my sister very happy!", "Love that movie.", "Exactly!

For the record, I do walk my dog but he's almost 10 and kind of lazy anyways so he's totally content with our morning walk and then time before/after work to fuck around out in the backyard. Her dog would probably destroy their place and maybe even make an escape attempt if they left him home alone that long without a chance to get his energy out.

This is what happens with friends/siblings/cousins, they find partners, they have their own families and those families become the priority. Their identity is tied to that and many people don't really have social lives that don't include their partner and or kids, they are a package deal, you better get used to it and be a lot more tactful. You acting so immaturely is only going to further hurt your relationship with your brother, creating more distant since his loyalties lay with his wife and he's not going to want to spend time with someone who disrespects her. You went about this thing entirely the wrong way, if you had reached out to your brother and said \"Hey, I really miss spending some one on one time with you and I noticed the beer expo is this weekend, any chance we can go and have a boys day?\" Chances are, even if he said he had to invite his wife to this event he'd understand what you needed and would likely suggest another time for you to hang out solo.

OP, use your big boy words and actually communicate with your bro next time. In the situation presented you are unequivocally the AH.", "haha!  I didn't notice but I'm leaving it now LOL", "Yes. But it seems to me OP doesn\u2019t have a lot of live experience. He\u2019s a 28YO still living with his parents. Even if he wants to go somewhere his brother has to get the tickets. It sounds like OP really needs to grow up.", "See OP, how nice and easy it is when people communicate openly about their wants?", "There's a lot of incel flags popping up. Resenting the wife, calling his niece/nephew THE KID, him being immature about his bro's marriage.", "I picked up on this in my post, too. He sounds exhausting."]}
