{"id": 25937, "submission_id": "166ehtk", "title": "AITA for kicking a couple out of our wedding for getting engaged during the bouquet toss, which resulted in that being the center of conversation for the rest of the night?", "selftext": "(Apologies for yet another wedding post.)\r  \n\r  \nMy wife and I (26/F & 32/M) got married two weeks ago. At our reception, her cousin \u201cRachel\u201d (24/F) caught the bouquet. Apparently her boyfriend \u201cRoss\u201d (25/M) had been carrying a ring around waiting for the right time to propose and decided her catching the bouquet was a sign.\r  \n\r  \nSo, immediately after Rachel caught the bouquet, Ross ran out to the dance floor and got down on one knee to propose to her. She said yes and so obviously this shifted all of the attention onto Ross and Rachel. Everyone surrounded them to congratulate them and then Rachel asked the DJ to play \u201ctheir song\u201d for them to dance, which derailed the next few things we had planned. \r  \n\r  \nI already wasn\u2019t happy about this because we only had the photographer available for a certain number of hours and I was worried about going off the schedule. But what really upset me was that I could see that my wife\u2019s feelings were obviously very hurt that Ross and Rachel were stealing our thunder. My wife is really not the type of person to want a lot of attention or to be comfortable spending a lot of money on herself, so our wedding was the one special day when she was able to do so without feeling guilty about it, and seeing it get ruined for her was awful.\r  \n\r  \nI decided to ask Ross and Rachel to leave, and at the time my wife agreed with me. So, when I next had the chance, I pulled Ross aside to tell him that I didn\u2019t appreciate him upstaging us and that I thought it would be best if he and Rachel left early so we could enjoy the rest of the night. Ross started arguing with me saying that I was acting nuts, which caused more of a scene than I expected or wanted because a small group of our wedding guests overheard the conversation and jumped in with their opinions.\r  \n\r  \nRoss and Rachel did ultimately agree to leave, but for the rest of the night people were talking not just about them getting engaged but also about me kicking them out. Everyone was on our side, but even so my wife and I weren\u2019t happy that people continued to talk more about Ross and Rachel. The reason we wanted them to leave was because we didn\u2019t want to keep being reminded all night of the stunt they had just pulled on us instead of being able to simply celebrate our marriage with our friends and family.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife has since said that it was wrong to kick Ross and Rachel out, and we should\u2019ve pretended to be happy for them in the moment so as not to further ruin the night because people would have talked less about it that way. Rachel\u2019s mother has also complained to my wife\u2019s mother about me kicking them out, saying that we should\u2019ve brought it up to them privately later instead of letting a faux pas turn into a squabble because now that\u2019s the only thing anyone is going to remember about our wedding and/or about Ross and Rachel\u2019s engagement.\r  \n\r  \nI do still think that Ross and Rachel, mostly Ross, were assholes in this situation, but was I also?", "created_utc": 1693496257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166ehtk/aita_for_kicking_a_couple_out_of_our_wedding_for/", "score": 6882, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The truth is, no one likes someone who causes a scene or fluff up. They would have talked about Ross and Rachel, how uncouth and rude they were, and how kind and gracious you and the bride were toward them when they didn't deserve it.

They were AH for the stunt they did at your wedding. \n\nAnd if that's how Rachel apologized she's as much AH as her BF because she's feeling no remorse and not even owning up their deed. I was thinking maybe she was somewhat blindsided with how her bf did the proposal but after knowing how she said sorry to you, I'm sure she's also as much to blame even if she was unaware that her bf will do something like this.

I can understand Ross\u2019s excitement. I\u2019m sure his internal monologue went \u201cHOLY SHIT SHE CAUGHT IT I SHOULD DO IT NOW\u201d and that was the end of the thought process.

Can I be nosey and ask you to share?", "Haha no worries! So neither of us have done anything too crazy or anything, lived in a small town and just nothing much to do without driving 3 hours. So I had the idea of a hot air balloon to start the day. Which was nice, except it took off before dawn so you could see the sunrise while in the air. Which meant traveling 3 hours into a different timezone. The day had meant to be a full day of new and exciting thing, but after than and a nice lunch, we napped until we had to leave for a couples photo shoot I had planned, which is where I proposed. She knew I had the ring, though didn\u2019t know what it looked like since I had it custom made.

Then she stationed a chair right beside the door. As soon as we'd gone inside and shut the door behind us, she pulled the chair directly in front of that door, and planted herself on it as if she had just turned into a mountain: firm and disciplined and *totally* immovable.\n\nWe had a lovely twenty minutes to relax together before the rest of the chaos began.
