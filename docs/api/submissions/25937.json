{"id": 25937, "submission_id": "166ehtk", "title": "AITA for kicking a couple out of our wedding for getting engaged during the bouquet toss, which resulted in that being the center of conversation for the rest of the night?", "selftext": "(Apologies for yet another wedding post.)\r  \n\r  \nMy wife and I (26/F & 32/M) got married two weeks ago. At our reception, her cousin \u201cRachel\u201d (24/F) caught the bouquet. Apparently her boyfriend \u201cRoss\u201d (25/M) had been carrying a ring around waiting for the right time to propose and decided her catching the bouquet was a sign.\r  \n\r  \nSo, immediately after Rachel caught the bouquet, Ross ran out to the dance floor and got down on one knee to propose to her. She said yes and so obviously this shifted all of the attention onto Ross and Rachel. Everyone surrounded them to congratulate them and then Rachel asked the DJ to play \u201ctheir song\u201d for them to dance, which derailed the next few things we had planned. \r  \n\r  \nI already wasn\u2019t happy about this because we only had the photographer available for a certain number of hours and I was worried about going off the schedule. But what really upset me was that I could see that my wife\u2019s feelings were obviously very hurt that Ross and Rachel were stealing our thunder. My wife is really not the type of person to want a lot of attention or to be comfortable spending a lot of money on herself, so our wedding was the one special day when she was able to do so without feeling guilty about it, and seeing it get ruined for her was awful.\r  \n\r  \nI decided to ask Ross and Rachel to leave, and at the time my wife agreed with me. So, when I next had the chance, I pulled Ross aside to tell him that I didn\u2019t appreciate him upstaging us and that I thought it would be best if he and Rachel left early so we could enjoy the rest of the night. Ross started arguing with me saying that I was acting nuts, which caused more of a scene than I expected or wanted because a small group of our wedding guests overheard the conversation and jumped in with their opinions.\r  \n\r  \nRoss and Rachel did ultimately agree to leave, but for the rest of the night people were talking not just about them getting engaged but also about me kicking them out. Everyone was on our side, but even so my wife and I weren\u2019t happy that people continued to talk more about Ross and Rachel. The reason we wanted them to leave was because we didn\u2019t want to keep being reminded all night of the stunt they had just pulled on us instead of being able to simply celebrate our marriage with our friends and family.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife has since said that it was wrong to kick Ross and Rachel out, and we should\u2019ve pretended to be happy for them in the moment so as not to further ruin the night because people would have talked less about it that way. Rachel\u2019s mother has also complained to my wife\u2019s mother about me kicking them out, saying that we should\u2019ve brought it up to them privately later instead of letting a faux pas turn into a squabble because now that\u2019s the only thing anyone is going to remember about our wedding and/or about Ross and Rachel\u2019s engagement.\r  \n\r  \nI do still think that Ross and Rachel, mostly Ross, were assholes in this situation, but was I also?", "created_utc": 1693496257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166ehtk/aita_for_kicking_a_couple_out_of_our_wedding_for/", "score": 802, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not saying you *should* have if you didn't want to, but unfortunately, if you had both smiled, congratulated them, and acted thrilled to share your time, others would have felt more kindly toward you. The truth is, no one likes someone who causes a scene or fluff up. They would have talked about Ross and Rachel, how uncouth and rude they were, and how kind and gracious you and the bride were toward them when they didn't deserve it.

Somebody else\u2019s wedding is not somebody else\u2019s lees engagement venue.", "Hey, at least you won't have to feel guilty about not getting them a wedding present - you subsidized their engagement party!", "Ugh, Rachel is such an appropriate moniker, how entitled do you have to be to be passive-aggressive to the Bride/Groom after trying to upstage them?\n\nThe sheer lack of self-awareness is startling.", "Show her all these comments so she know you both are not wrong in kicking then out. They were AH for the stunt they did at your wedding. \n\nAnd if that's how Rachel apologized she's as much AH as her BF because she's feeling no remorse and not even owning up their deed. I was thinking maybe she was somewhat blindsided with how her bf did the proposal but after knowing how she said sorry to you, I'm sure she's also as much to blame even if she was unaware that her bf will do something like this. Just go LC with family right now and enjoy your newly wedded life as much because indulging yourself with family bickering right now is going to ruin your vibes. Focus on eachother and go enjoy your honeymoon.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding.", "Missed that my bad. Okay. They are all assholes.  If I were the OP I would look to damage control, not escalate.  Throwing them out was escalating.  Look at the results. It didn't work out well.", "And she could\u2019ve said no or told him to stop when he started to get on a knee.", "I think OP is just trotting out the same lies he was told by Ross. You don\u2019t take an expensive ring to a wedding, where you can reasonably be expected to drink, dance and take off your jacket, without intent to use it.", "I agree with you. I can understand Ross\u2019s excitement. I\u2019m sure his internal monologue went \u201cHOLY SHIT SHE CAUGHT IT I SHOULD DO IT NOW\u201d and that was the end of the thought process. He didn\u2019t think about how other people around him might feel he was just focused on Rachel. Yes he\u2019s an AH but I understand how the situation happened.", "Doesn\u2019t matter how long.  He transferred it to his suit pocket at a formal event.  He should have never done that.", "Definitely! Not saying he did it maliciously, just wasn\u2019t considerate and that it was okay for the couple to be hurt by it. Know matter people think of weddings, it is meant to be for the couples. Though personally since I knew my wife would be doing most of the designing of the wedding day(I did help and give opinions, we budgeted options together but we went with her style for a lot.) I wanted the engagement to be planned by me. I didn\u2019t do a smart job of it haha and we laughed about it then and now, but it\u2019s special because it was something I planned for the two of us. It was deliberate and intentional, and showed how much I care. Just waking up at 2am for the start of the day doesn\u2019t give people a lot of energy for a full day of activity.", "Hindsight is 20/20. OP was not an AH for the decision they made, and again the bad outcome of that decision squarely lands on Ross for refusing to comply. Ross is even now sending flying monkeys.\n\nHave fun suffering through thoughtless and selfish guests at your events. Act a fool at my event and I will show you the door and get on with enjoying my day.", "That's what gets me. If I was friends with the dude I would have tackled him like secret service. People are dense.", "Which we don\u2019t know the truth which makes it debatable.", "To which **I agree** but people are hung up on my wording.", "Ross didn\u2019t seem malicious (at first) which is why I said I could *almost* give them a pass.  Them doing the song and escalating pushed them (Ross and Rachel) solidly into AH territory.\n\nMy husband proposed in a parking lot but I\u2019m not one for grand romantic gestures and he was excited.", "Awww, your engagement story sounds cute. Can I be nosey and ask you to share?", "Haha no worries! So neither of us have done anything too crazy or anything, lived in a small town and just nothing much to do without driving 3 hours. So I had the idea of a hot air balloon to start the day. Which was nice, except it took off before dawn so you could see the sunrise while in the air. Which meant traveling 3 hours into a different timezone. The day had meant to be a full day of new and exciting thing, but after than and a nice lunch, we napped until we had to leave for a couples photo shoot I had planned, which is where I proposed. She knew I had the ring, though didn\u2019t know what it looked like since I had it custom made. Wanted to try surprising her a little, and the only way I could think of getting legit photos of the proposal was to have it happen while taking pictures. She loved it, loved the ring, but we definitely laugh about that we had to Power Nap before the proposal.", "That\u2019s my kind of story - power naps rock! Thanks for sharing; it\u2019s really sweet."]}
