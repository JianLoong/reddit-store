I was very malnourished, underweight, lost housing and after a brief hospitalization was diagnosed adult failure to thrive. I met with a dietician who recommended supplementing my meals with a meal replacement shake to gain weight along with some other recommendations. It was a super wierd time for me. When your that far you don't realize and keep trudging forward in hopes you can go long enough to fix it yourself.\n\nFast forward now I have a job. I'm able to budget about 400/month in food. The problem is that the meal replacement shakes that have the least sugar/best macronutrients I have found are about $10 a day. Leaving $25/week for actual food. I started using the food pantry. The one closest is a weekly one and didn't require a specific income (mine was slightly over for a few of them)\n\nMy friend found out cause I have been cooking foods I don't normally to adapt to the type of food I'm getting. She said I'm \"using a sob story and fake diagnosis to take advantage of poor people's resources while buying fancy gym shakes\" and it's a privileged way to be.\n\n I told her that when I was poor I wouldnt be upset at someone doing what im doing and that she shouldn't get to decide the morality as someone who has never had issues getting food that's needed to live. She pointed out that because I'm also exercising that if I cut back on that I could cut the food. And it's the same as a gym bro using the panty to make himself look better. \n\nI told her it's not even about aesthetics. While yes it's nice to not see my ribs and spine sticking out, it's also nice to not pass out from exhaustion and that she has no clue what she's talking about and that she needs to learn not everything has black and white morality and it's super rude to minimize the issue. \n\nShe also suggested using the protein shake money to make food that matches the calories. Double the food for cheaper. Problem is I can't fit that much food in me. It would also take longer. Which she doesn't think is a problem but the doctor I met with made that seem scary. Especially cause it's already been months since the diagnosis and I'm just now gaining weight back. \n\nNow I'm blocked on Instagram. And I'm wondering if IATA because I didn't use the budget for food and used the food bank when I technically had a food budget instead of allowing poor people to eat what they need too?", "created_utc": 1681672389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ole6g/aita_for_using_the_food_bank_in_order_to_use_my/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This person was not a good friend. Nor, does it sound like, a good person. Maybe they would like to stand outside the food bank and act as a bouncer?

You saw a doctor, who diagnosed you with a very serious illness, who referred you to a kind of specialist that can help you (a dietician).

You need to gain weight and muscle, along with preventing vitamin deficiencies so you don't have further issues for example iron deficiency can cause fainting spells that can cause head injuries. \n\nI would definitely reach out to a dietician regarding how expensive this course of treatment is, that is a TON of money. Maybe she knows of somewhere that will provide them cheaper or of a brand she recommends that's harder to find but less expensive. Maybe her office occasionally gets stacks of coupons or samples that she can sneak in your purse. I'm on a migraine medication that's $75 a dose even with very good insurance and when i couldn't afford a dose one month, she gave me a sample. You never know.

X meat. X milk. X fruits/veggies. First time I went I nearly cried. But the one in my home town was just tons of breads. Which isn't bad. But nutrient deficiencies were a worry constantly.
