This is sneaky. Your Mother either chose to host or agreed without stating that she expected you to cover some of the cost. I've honestly never heard of a parent expecting to be reimbursed for hosting a graduation party for their own kid.", "NTA. That is ridiculous. Your parents threw you a graduation party. This costs money, duh. So if I throw someone a baby shower or birthday party I get to take half the presents? Please.", "NTA. If I were in ur shoes, I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a possible asshole whatsoever. The money was rewarded to YOU as a gift for getting through school, sad on ur moms part", "NTA, she should have specified if she\u2019d expect repayment before throwing the party.  It\u2019s unreasonable for her to expect money after the fact.", "NTA, and if she was a good mother she wouldn\u2019t be asking you for the money. Those Perry\u2019s are meant for you to get money to help jumpstart you in life. However to satisfy the \u201cYTA\u201d people that I have a gut feeling will be here, I have a few questions. \n\n1. Did you ask for this party or was it just thrown for you? \n\n1(a). Did you offer to help pay ahead of time if you asked for party? It\u2019s quite rude to ask for a party and expect it to be free \n\n1(b). Did you offer to help pay even though it was offered? Automatically makes you NTA point blank. \n\n2.  Did you specifically ask for this cake that was \u201chundreds of dollars\u201d (not worth btw) or did she just go out of her way for it?\n\n2(a). If you asked\u2026 why..? \n\nThat\u2019s all. Honestly no matter how you answer, my judgement won\u2019t change. I hope your graduation was good!", "NTA. I cant imagine asking my kid for money they received as a gift. Its theirs.", "NTA. You were gifted that money as a reward for your accomplishments. I'm assuming that your Mother never mentioned she expected reimbursement? Don't get me wrong, I'd think it pretty shitty even if she did. Throwing your kid a graduation party on your dime is very much a fair expectation when you're a parent.", "NTA --- You should ask your mother if she also now wants you to pay your share of all the birthday money you got to \"reimburse\" her for all the work she did for your birthday parties.", "NTA. **If your mother didn't want to pay for the party for you, she shouldn't have offered to throw the party for you!** \n\nYour GRADUATION GIFTS are YOURS! Do not let her try to take them. \n\nThose who gave the gifts would be very offended - I know I would be.", "NTA. This is a common mode of operating for toxic people- give you something you haven\u2019t asked for, then make you pay them for it. It is a classic. My parents did it too. It\u2019s even in the Mrs Maisel TV show. It\u2019s awful. You have company at least.\n\nTry to become as independent as you can, as quickly as you can!", "INFO\n\nDid you ask for the party, or was it your parent's idea?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Part of throwing a party for your children is spending money, and not using the gifts that your child receives, to reimburse for the party. There might as well have not been any party to begin with if your parents were just gonna steal the gifts to pay for the party lol. Tell your parents to kick rocks. It\u2019s YOUR gifts. Congratulations on graduating.", "NTA at all ! Your mother threw a celebration party for you\u2026.with no preconditions. People were kind and gave you cash instead of gifts\u2026.would she have expected a % of your gifts if you hadn\u2019t been given cash ? The money is for you to spend on yourself to celebrate your achievement.", "Nope, not one red cent.  Unless there was an agreement in advance of the party that you would share cash gifts with your mom to help pay for the event, those cash presents are gifts to you and your money -- yours alone, not your mother's.  \n\nYour mother suddenly springing on you that she wasn't actually throwing a party for you but that you were, in fact, throwing part of your own congratulatory event, is really low.\n\nDon't even dignify her demands with a conversation.  Go with, No, I appreciated the lovely party, but I'm not going to do that.  If her response becomes abusive or guilt-inducing, back away from the unreasonable, weird greed.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nNTA", "WNBTA\n\nKEEP the money!!! that was a gift for your graduation, not a donation to help pay for the party. If you are really feeling guilty, give your mom a hug or cook her dinner. Just don't give her a dime.", "NTA - you didn't \"earn\" the money - people gave you the money because they like/love/care for you and wanted to give you a present. The same way you would expect your parents to feel - and you and everyone else thought they were throwing you a party because you are their child, they live you, and they wanted to celebrate you accomplishment.\n\nThey should have thrown a parth they coukd afgord. It is really strange to ask a child honoree to chip in for the party, especially if it was asked for after thd fact.\n\nI might feel differently if you'd asked for specific things that they didn't want, like a photobooth, or caviar, etc. Then you might want to chip in. But if your mom planned it and made the majority of decisions, then she should have only planned the party she wanted to pay for.", "NTA. What kind of a mother she is for wanting you to share your gift money? I am appalled", "You could ask the people that gave you the money if they prefer it go to your mother or you - NTA", "YBTA", "To answer your questions:\n\n1. I didn\u2019t ask for the party. My parents usually will throw parties for big milestones like this. I did not offer to help pay but I did make some monetary contributions (bought snacks and decorations)\n\n2. Didn\u2019t ask for the cake. My mom was excited about the cake because she knows a guy that makes extravagant cakes (she just had one last year for her birthday) and she knew that I would like it.", "Lol she would probably agree to that.", "It was my parents idea.", "Super NTA. You brought snacks and decor to your own party. That was more than enough. I hope you keep the money OP, you deserve it. Some unprompted advise, save it for something big like an appt or car.
