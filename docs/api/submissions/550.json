I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s B and she just didn\u2019t know how to communicate that because communication is not something that children are super great at yet.", "NTA. Was she going to donated it to those people who can't afford it or something? Does it actually in the long run make a huge difference to how many pens you'll buy? As long as it's a one off fun thing, there's really no harm done here. Yes, everyone should be making sure to waste as little as possible to help the world become a better place. But one pen isn't going to change that. You want real world change? Donate things like pens and food to those poor people, volunteer, spread the news about good charities, and most importantly, **hold the 1% responsible.**\n\nYour friend is being an asshole. But it's such a light asshole that I'm happy about it. God it feels good to see a story about some petty argument for once rather then an obvious abuse case. Unless she brings it up again you can probably just forget about this.", "INFO: Who's pen was it?", "NTA, If you don't care that you got ink over yourself then it really doesn't matter. Unless it was some super duper expensive pen or didn't belong to you, it doesn't matter. If it wasn't your pen, then you're the asshole. If it's like $1,000 pen, you are the asshole. But if not, she's probably being a pretty big hypocrite. I doubt that she's somebody who's literally never wasted anything. If she owns anything that isn't critical to her own survival, she's being just as wasteful. Does she buy plastic? Like it sounds like she's being ridiculously self righteous.", "YTA\n\nYour friend is right, you are wasting the pen if you play tag with it, and there is a good chance you break it. Pens are very sensitive, even small damage to the writing tip can make them useless.\n\nBased on your story, you're 10-12yo? Sounds like the age for a playing with the pen and ink story. Also the age when you'll so easily dismiss good advice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think at a minimum you've got to say that everybody sucks here because she's way out of line giving a shit about a pen. And it sounds like it's just a white out pen that was almost out. Like... She sounds like the type of person who's looking for an excuse to act high and mighty. It's not her pen."]}
