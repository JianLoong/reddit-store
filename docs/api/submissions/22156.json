Fast forward to last year, my family moved from one state to another (wife and 2 kids) mother in law has always had bad trouble with cars. We help as much as we can in teaching her and showing her. About 1 month into us moving my wife says we should let her borrow my car since hers been down for awhile. She works everyday cleaning house and I work from home. We have told her to get her car fixed for months and she didn\u2019t listen, so we let her borrow my car. Now nothing bad has happened to the car, she\u2019s been taking care of it. Getting oil changed and everything, we still pay for it monthly. Anytime I bring up the car, mind you I use humor a lot and have been told when I bring up the car with jokes, I don\u2019t tend to do it lightly. So iv stopped and chilled with the jokes. One joke I made was that a payment of food was due for using the car, apparently I made her feel bad because I brought up the car. Fast forward to now, it\u2019s almost a year since she\u2019s been using it, I don\u2019t have a car I\u2019m about to go back to school on the fall and I don\u2019t know how to approach the situation. I haven\u2019t been able to use my car and anytime I bring up that I would like it back because I need a car, I get attacked because she needs it more. She cleans house, I work from home training dogs and doing some streaming on the side. I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around the situation. Anytime I bring the car up with my wife it causes issues, she has 2 other sons that do very well for themselves and even they don\u2019t want to help her with a car because they know she just ruins them and doesn\u2019t take care of them. I\u2019m kinda lost here but if I\u2019m the asshole then I guess I got to let it go. If I\u2019m missing any information feel free to ask, again this my first post so I apologize for the crap grammar and text.", "created_utc": 1689276603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yu1tl/aita_for_asking_my_mil_to_return_my_car_i_let_her/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How long did they expect you to wait to get it back? Has she not saved any money from her job or did she expect to just keep your car until she retired or passed on?\n\nYou didn\u2019t need it so you let her use it. Circumstances have changed and you will need your car so you have every right to get it back. Most people would not have been this nice and let someone take their car for a year.\n\nDoes she still have her old car that you asked her to get fixed? It sounds like it\u2019s past time for her to actually get it repaired.

You paid on this car and never used it. You also paid the insurance so no, the time has come. She acts like covering the oil change is a gift. You have offered to pay 1/2 of her car repairs and she's made no progress.  These are facts, not opinions.\n\nCheck in with your wife. Explain time has expired and the car needs to be returned.  Your shared life priorities require you have a car and and once it is at your house the car needs a full clearing and check-up; tire pressure, fluids, windshield wipers or more costly things: new tires. Be prepared to do a full clean-up. Her history of thrashing cars suggests this will be necessary.\n\nPhone MIL and also confirm via text. Communicate facts: we will be at your house on 'x' date to pick up the car at 'x' time. Perhaps give her a 1 to 2 week timeline to accommodate her car repair schedule but I honestly don't think she'll get it done in time. Stick to this timeline. If you don't it will be a perpetual bicker battle. Bring your extra set of keys to use if this becomes uncomfortable. Feel free to say she needs to figure this out like checking in with her support system: sons, friends ,etc.\n\n\"We\" will be there can be anyone; your wife, a friend.  Best prepare for MIL to say more illogical reasons and statements that make you the 'bad guy' to delay this.  Tell yourself, \"I expected this to happen.\"  If others tell you you are 'horrible' explain she used it for a year, your family needs it and they can step up and support MIL's car issue moving forward. People can get a lot of mileage out of shaming and blaming others; cut them off and move on: \"We don't view this the same way and that's ok.\".  Best to you. You are so not an ahole. Good luck with school.", "Go visit your MIL with your wife, in the wife's car. While returning just pick up your car keys and mention that since you are going back to school you will be needing your car so you are taking it back. Let MIL know that your wife has generously agreed to leave her car behind. Let the mother and daughter sort it out among themselves after that. You will be well out of it.\n\nNTA", "NTA.
