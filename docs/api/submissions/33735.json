Like a picture. Or gift her time with you, e.g. plan a walk to special place, maybe get a small treat together etc. \n\nThen she can't lose her shit about not getting anything. If she doesn't appreciate it well that's her problem imo. \n\nBtw is it possible your mum is also on the spectrum? This might explain her over the top reaction to no gifts/wrong gifts.", "You\u2019re not obligated to give anyone a gift and you\u2019re definitely not obligated to be around your toxic mother.\n\nETA: especially when you don\u2019t have the funds to do so.", "NTA, your mom sounds selfish. My mom is autistic, i am disabled, have a kid and am on a very limited income as well, no one expected us to get them anything. You have to take care of yourself first, and also you deserve to buy yourself art supplies and things to enjoy life. She sounds like the type even if you got her something she would've had something negative to say about it. Don't let her get you down or use the gifts she's gotten you, HER CHILD, against you.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't have the money what can you do."]}
