It dries clothes", "NTA Marketplace deals are final, unless you deliberately withhold info.

I try not to assume the worst in people... but when he picked it up he did have another one in his truck.. he said it was his that was in for repairs, and that's why he was buying this one, as a temp, but he got his back the same day. Frankly, if he had backed out right then and there, cool, no problem.. but he didn't. So part of me is wondering also if he just didn't want an extra now.", "NTA - cut all contact.", "NTA. Some of the older dryers are made better than new ones.  He got a deal for that price.
