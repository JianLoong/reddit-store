This year she informed me about the trip and I assumed it would be just her going since ive never been invited previously and I get very car sick. My car sickness is bad enough that I cant sit in a car for more than 10-20 minutes without getting seriously nauseous and throwing up and I dont even own my own car since I cant drive it anywhere more than 10 miles away. However I was told that her parents wanted me to tag along with them since I was now part of the family and should partake in family traditions. \n\nI brought it up to my wife that she knows I cant sit through any long car rides so I couldn't join them on the drive but id be happy to book a flight and meet them at the destination. She told me that wouldn't work Since they were making multiple pit stops during the drive and spending evenings doing activities that she wanted me to join them for. So I offered to ride my motorcycle along with them and that way id have my own transportations when we got there this seemed to be enough of a compromise for her and she let her parents know.\n\nSo she let her parents know and they called me up and seemed pretty annoyed and they told me now that Im part of their family I should be making personal sacrifices too be part of their traditions. After a bit of back and forth I told them if they couldnt respect my needs then I would perfectly ok with dropping out off the trip which was enough to get them to stop trying to convince me to sit in the car with them.\n\nAfter the call my wife was pretty mad at me for being rude to her parents and not trying to convince them more before giving them a ultimatum.

Thats a relationship wrecker of a trip bro", "NTA. Your wife  is though. An extended road trip would be miserable for you and for them. You don\u2019t want to be queasy and sick the whole time and no one wants someone getting sick in their car. Someone\u2019s health should not be sacrificed in order to maintain tradition. I would tell your wife that the fact her parents tried to browbeat you into it and she\u2019s defending it is not acceptable.", "NTA.

Sure, it sounds like they make a whole thing out of the trip, but you have a completely legitimate reason to not want to go on even a short road trip.

It\u2019s *not* that that wouldn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d, or your very reasonable compromises as an answer. \n\nAnd personally, I think this trip sounds like a little slice of hell, all of you in a car for what, 20 plus hours of driving? and stops to sightsee, and you sick as a dog, no doubt in the back seat. Ugh.", "NTA! \n\nAlthough I would be tempted (coz I\u2019m petty af) to go in the car and throw my guts up repeatedly ON them and their car - good luck getting that stench out \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, your wife SHOULD be mad at her parents for not respecting your reasons - which are super valid! In fact she should have shot their original idea down as fast as they said it, but she didn\u2019t\u2026\u2026maybe you have a problem there", "NTA\n100% you should go and throw up all over their car.", "The alternative would be to go and barf in their car and show them the reality of your situation and tha I would bet they won\u2019t pressure you ever again.

After all, family should be making personal sacrifices. They can stay in a puke stenched car for days", "NTA.   \nIt\u2019s ok to set boundaries, especially around health issues. If someone doesn\u2019t respect or consider your health issues, that is a reasonable place to create a firm boundary. \n\nYou offered alternatives.", "NTA.

All over them and the car. And of course NTA", "NTA,.  Your wife did the right thing by telling her parents about the compromise, they should not have called you.  When they did call you, your wife should have backed you up, since they went around her and stepped on some serious boundaries to do so.\n\nI wouldn't want to go either after that exchange, but talk it out with your wife.  Let her know that they were the rude ones.  You and your wife had made a decision as a couple and her parents didn't respect that.

You can maliciously comply and said that you can join them in the car and vomit everywhere.", "Hear, hear! I was going to suggest the same, people who don't get carsick sometimes just don't understand and need to be shown. It's tough, but might be less unpleasant than all the shit the inlaws will give otherwise.", "Terrible advice. It still requires OP being miserable for however long their road trip takes (and it sounds like they\u2019re splitting it over the course of several days). OP\u2019s wife needs to grow up and tell her parents that her spouse\u2019s health is more important than their tradition when there are multiple other solutions.", "Agree, but don't take a bag.", "Its more of a they didnt believe that I was being completely serious so she wanted me to try harder to get them to understand what the issue was", ">You're refusing to make a small sacrifice to be with your wife and spend time with her family. Sure, your car sickness is a valid concern, but have you considered taking medication or trying other remedies like looking out the window? \n\n\n\nHere comes the hero with all the answers that Op has never considered even to the extent of not having a car. To the extent of suggesting that he bicycles alongside them and you think his medical issues are a *valid concern* but he should make this small sacrifice. \n\nJust like he told his wife's parents, he can't. Give an inch and people take a mile. Like here where his literal health concerns are being shat on.", "I came here to suggest this! lol \n\nOP NTA", "To be fair, OP said he can\u2019t sit in the car for more than 10-20 minutes before he feels ill.   If he barfs within the first 10-20 minutes, they can just take him home, or he can get an Uber.   I would suggest to OP that he eats something super smelly before getting in the car so that when he barfs, they can enjoy that odour for the rest of their ride.\n\nSeriously though, these people have no respect for OP, and that includes his girlfriend.   He offered up a perfectly reasonable alternative (taking his motorcycle) and that is somehow not good enough for them.   I sense trouble ahead.", "\"Try harder\".\n\nHas your wife seen this happen? Maybe she can graphically describe it.\n\nOtherwise, people who don't believe you are serious about this - maybe they think you are just trying to get out of the road trip? - will need a real time demonstration. Offer one. In fact, make them drive you around for an hour or two to really get the point across. Sucks for you though.", "So her stance is \"My parents think you're a liar, you're an AH for them not believing you.\"\n\nWell that sounds like a healthy marriage conversation there.  /s", "Its not that bad shes over it now she just has a really hard time going against her parents"]}
