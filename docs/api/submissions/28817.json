She told me that wouldn't work Since they were making multiple pit stops during the drive and spending evenings doing activities that she wanted me to join them for. So I offered to ride my motorcycle along with them and that way id have my own transportations when we got there this seemed to be enough of a compromise for her and she let her parents know.\n\nSo she let her parents know and they called me up and seemed pretty annoyed and they told me now that Im part of their family I should be making personal sacrifices too be part of their traditions.

Purposefully planning a multistop trip sounds her parents were trying to force and experiment on you to \"prove\" you are lying about your condition.", "NTA\n\nSo basically, her parents insist on you being ill just so you can be \"part of the family\"? \n\nYour wife needs to stick up for you with her parents.", "Severe Car sickness/motion sickness is a horrible thing , people just don\u2019t understand how bad that is. \nAs for your in laws , they sound horrible, hopefully you guys can heal the rift.", "Join them.

Your wife is a massive AH knowing this and being ticked cause you can't drive with her and her parents. She should not have even argued about flying. Her parents are AHs for trying to guilt trip you. You set your boundary and stuck to it. I get car sick and would have flown down. There is not enough dramamine on earth  to make me do that car trip.", "NTA convince them?? No need, it's your choice. The answer is thanks, but I'm not riding in the car with you guys.", "You should just ride with, get sick and vomit in their car just to spite them for trying to downplay your car sickness. 20 miles? They will be able to turn around and then will have a car that smells like vomit. Honestly this would be the best punishment for them.", "Offer a test drive, and do like that kid in Stand By Me.  Eat the worst foods for you right before the test drive.   Proceed to vomit everywhere.   \n\n\nAnd just like in Stand by Me, everyone else proceeds to violently puke.  Hopefully you\u2019re t the side of the road.   \n\n\nWalk back home.  In this time you can proceed to post on r/MaliciousCompliance", "NTA, I don't understand this at all. They were told you get violently ill in cars and they still expected you to come?\n\nAre they mentally challenged?", "NTA \nThe parents are though, I can\u2019t imagine a situation where my in laws would consider calling me to express some kind of annoyance or disappointment.\n\nMy wife and my decisions are between us. My wife also knows me well enough to cut off any suggestions that wouldn\u2019t fly at the pass.\nWait till you have kids and these people will want input into their upbringing, better set those ground rules early", "NTA \nYou get carsick easily and I've been carsick before and I hated it. That drive would basically be torture for you and why don't they just fly? Boston to Atlanta is a very long way away.", "You weren't rude. Her parents were.", "So the \"personal sacrifices\" they want him to make are vomiting in the car every 15 minutes?\n\nPass on that one. NTA", "Don\u2019t you think the OP would have already tried the most obvious solution?", "Have you taken Dramamine?  If you had, you would know the drowsiness is a real problem for hours and hours!  It is less awful than vomiting, but it is not a fun state of being.  Then to be drugged for roughly 8 days, going and returning?  Not a fun trip.\n\nAlso, Dramamine stops the vomiting, but doesn't always take care of all the nausea.\n\nRecommending drugs with clear side effects instead of agreeing with OP's \"no\" to 2000 miles of car travel seems ridiculous.", "Exactly! Plan a day trip for the 4 of you before the big trip. After you puke in their car, maybe they\u2019ll get it. \nI think offering to fly is fine even with the pit stops. If they know when they are arriving in ATL, you simply book your flight for that. \nYour second offering is also great. It covers transpo when you arrive as well. \nI can\u2019t understand why her parents are being so rigid and controlling about this. They are the ones being rude. It\u2019s not like you are refusing to go. \nNTA.", "Imagine riding a motorcycle all the way from Boston to Florida (and back!!). That\u2019s not a minor compromise. Offering to do this was going above and beyond", "I was going to say they will all make sacrifices once OP starts throwing up everywhere and they start complaining about why he can't stop.", "Ive gone through a night of nothing but vomiting and gagging up nothing when finally empty. That shit hurts your abdominals like hell! I was technically cured and still stuck in bed cus i couldn't move! Even shifting to one side using my arms used enough of my stomach muscles to make me cry. \n\nEssentially, he wouldn't be able to \"participate in activities\" anyway and would likely be recovering the whole damn time they were in Atlanta", "They wanted to stop spend time at various cities along the drive", "It's a workout for sure, but if you enjoy riding it can be great.  I did a coast-to-coast a while back, it was awesome.", "You would think so but since they didn't mention it as a compromise/solution then we don't know, do we?", "I have taken Dramamine and if you knew what you're talking about you'd also know you can buy a non-drowsy version. Same with Gravel. There are many options out there and just because Dramamine doesn't work for you doesn't mean it doesn't work for everyone. Also, I've always found it to stop vomiting as well as nausea so no clue why you're claiming that it doesn't to be honest. Never seen that.", "You also know exactly when you are going to turn or slow down, because you are in control of it.", "\"Oh my god, you're making yourself puke just to prove some stupid point!?!?!?!\" would be the reaction, not 'oh my god, I'm so sorry, I should have listened to you.'", "One of the parents is selfish and doesn't care what op has. They're the AH, not op. NTA", "Wine and beets. I did that then accidentally puked on my ex's parent's white bathroom rug.", "While common for a passenger, it's extremely unusual for the driver of a car to get motion sickness, especially if you are fine on a motorcycle or a plane. Eye focus on the road and in the distance mitigates the problem. Could you find a compromise by doing all the driving? \n\nNTA either for riding the motorcycle or staying home, but doing the trip in the same car could be a bonding experience if you can handle the driving.", "Generally does not work for motion sickness. Different signaling systems. Probably won't hurt, but probably won't help, unfortunately.", "Haha agreed. Say you'll go with them in the car and thank them for their patience. Then proceed to puke all over their car and do what wolf said. GG", "And then, having to stop every 10 miles to let the nausea pass. They won't get more than a 1/3 of the way back before they have to be home by the end of the week.", "Yea sounds like about 250 miles a day.", "That\u2019s a bummer. I am a vet, not a medico and we do t use it in vet med but know it\u2019s used for chemo patients. I have used the injectable stuff and it\u2019s great.", "I\u2019ll just piggyback on this to say OP\u2019s wife is a bit of an AH.\n\nFirst for not explaining the situation properly to her parents (leaving OP to issue an ultimatum).\n\nSecond for being MAD at him over it, instead of acknowledging that it was her bad for not fully conveying how bad OP\u2019s condition is.\n\nIf it\u2019s so bad he doesn\u2019t drive because he can\u2019t handle more than 10 miles at a time then clearly he\u2019s not exaggerating.", "Go on a short day trip with them before the big trip. Maybe say an hour or so?????", "It sounds like they both explained and the ILs just don't care or think it's as serious as it is. That's their problem.", "Which brings us back to the wife going off on OP when her parents were the unreasonable ones.", "inFinEgan\u2019s comment is gold!!\n\nNot paying for awards, but here\u2019s a poor woman\u2019s gold.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udf1f\n\nAnd I\u2019ve already upvoted it so the bot doesn\u2019t need to nag me about upvoting it.", "I think you're doing great.

I think you should go and throw up several times in the first hour. Then make them drop you off somewhere as it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re not going to last all the way. This will kill any future debates.", "Just the idea of being trapped in the car with the in-laws for 10-20 hrs makes me want to hurl. And I don\u2019t get car sick. Not TAH. Keep your freedom and stay home.", "Or perhaps, they should plan a pre trip excursion to a colonial site near Boston.  At least 40 minute drive.  The reasons that he asks not to go on 3 day drives will become incredibly clear to the in-laws, as they have to go to a car detailing service to have the vehicle cleaned.  \n\nOf course, the in-laws must sign a waver that absolves Op from liability of the cleaning because it was all at the demand of the in-laws.", "Nta Jesus do they really want to deal with someone who is sick pretty much the entire time?

Why do people feel entitled to force others into unwanted activities??", "NTA.  You should've gone and puked on everything they owned repeatedly.", "Hmmm. NTA. Maybe just start the trip, then vomit on them and their car as your travel sickness comes on. It won't be fun for you, but they will perhaps get the point.NTA", "NTA\n\nThe fact that sitting in cars makes you physically ill should have been enough. Honestly if that's the kind of people they are, I would be seriously reconsider the relationship altogether. Do you really want these people in your life? And your wife sucks too.

I forget what. On the way back I got so so car sick and it was everything I could do to not throw up in the back seat. I was the first person to get dropped off from that night. I literally started puking my guts up the moment I was out of the car. My friends got super concerned because to them it was so unexpected. Thankfully I was fine after a few minutes.
