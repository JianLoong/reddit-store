My mom and her mom were convinced that all she needed was male attention.  They thought that if we dated she would decide that she liked dudes.  \n\nBeing fully aware that my best friend was a lesbian for like five years at that point I went along with it after talking to my friend.  We would flirt with each other around our parents.  And it would always end the same way. With either me saying it was too bad she was a lesbian that wasn't at all confused about her sexuality or her saying that it was to bad I had male genitalia because I was the perfect girl for her.  \n\nIt just became part of our friendship.  I never once thought it would lead anywhere and she knew for a fact that it was all a joke.  But for a little while our mom's didn't get it.  So it has been twenty years now and we still do this when we get together.  \n\nMy wife knows all about it and accepted a long time ago that I was going to do this. My friend's wife thinks it's hilarious that we do this because my best friend is a gold star lesbian.  \n\nThe only people who do not think it is funny is our moms.  Her mom has finally, reluctantly, accepted her daughter for who she is.  She treats her politely and loves her adopted grandchildren.  My mom has apologised to my friend for trying to convert her.  My friend accepted and my mom hasn't brought it up since then. \n\nBut over Christmas my parents had a big party at their home.  My best friend's family was there.  We did our usual flirting when we saw each other.  \n\nMy mom and her mom cornered us and told us to stop being assholes. They said that the joke has gone on long enough and that they get it.  We said that we understood how they felt but our friendship and how we express it isn't really their business.  \n\nLet me be clear. We do not only do this in front of our moms. It is just how we are now. When I'm 80 I will still flirt with her.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672668471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101dffr/aita_for_mocking_my_mom/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is hilarious and a great inside joke that you and your friend share. Your moms don't like it because they're the butt of the joke, but that's their fault for trying to \"fix\" your friend.", "The fake lover we never knew we needed. NTA, and so awesome that OP's respective partners are cool with it!", "NTA.\n\nRevenge is a dish best served cold, with DECADES of leftovers... ;-)", "NTA\n\nMoms are only pissed because it's a reminder of their homophobia.", "NTA it\u2019s become an inside joke for you two that\u2019s been ongoing for so many years. The joke will never end now. It will always be funny they pushed you into it anyway so now this joke will last a lifetime and they have to accept that.", "NTA. If they truly cared they wouldn't resent your friend's sexuality. They asked you to stop because they still harbor ill feelings toward the friend's sexual preference and your flirting reminds them of that", "NTA. They do not get to dictate to you guys how you interact on your friendship.  They may have been the reason you started acting like this but it is between you and your bestie now.", "NTA, just some friends having fun time on their own way. It is comprensible that your mother didn't know how you're relationship was. But I think that now you told her she will not mind anymore.", "Nta, that\u2019s funny.", "NTA - your moms just sound stubborn and stuck in their ways. Y\u2019all sound hilarious", "The only AHs are your moms.  They both have internalized homophobia and need to grow up.\n\nNTA", "NTA this is great lol", "Soft YTA, tbh I just feel bad for your wife and the fact she\u2019ll have to put up with this all her life, and the fact you said she \u201caccepted it\u201d makes it seem like she didn\u2019t really want to.", "YTA\n\nSomeone who cares about both of you has specifically said that this bit you two do has gotten old. So knock it off. It\u2019s not the core of your relationship. They\u2019re not asking you to stop being friends. They\u2019re asking you to stop being AHs.\n\nSo stop.

A few seconds every few months?", "You sound like a lot of fun at parties", "The people who wanted this in the first place because they are homophobes don\u2019t like to be reminded they are homophobes, but you go on about how this guy is the asshole. Sorry but they don\u2019t get to decide how these people act when they hang out together. It\u2019s not hurting either respective partner and that\u2019s all these two need to worry about.", "NTA.

What she and your friend's mom did to you two in the effort to convert your friend, giving her the message that being a lesbian was not OK and had to be fixed, was really egregious.  This flirting is the way you two coped, and it developed into an affectionate part of your lasting, mutually supportive friendship.  Both of your wives get this.  The moms can just suck it up.  They created this; it exists; it's a natural part of your friendship; ignore them.", "Have tried telling her that not everything you do is about her and that this is an example?", "This \u2b06\ufe0f"]}
