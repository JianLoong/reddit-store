Poop is stinky. Maybe your nose doesn\u2019t work.", "It's gonna be summer at some point (I hope).\n\nI think you should keep the bags inside your home. Then if there's a smell, it's only your problem. You could even take the poop and flush it after your walk.", "Not defending OP at but I lived in a row home in a very busy city for 5 years and anything I left outside, cheap or not, was stolen. There were never any parking spots outside my house so I often had to drop stuff off, park, and come back. I learned very quickly that no matter how fast I return, it will be stolen if it\u2019s left out. I passed by many houses that had chained up their little dog poop trash cans to the railing or something. Just sayin.", "If he's moving soon I'd probably just let him stay pissy since it won't matter in the long run. If there is a way you can put the bags into some other bag or a device with a lid, I think that would be ideal.", "At -40 F you can't smell anything because your nostrils have frozen! (I live in North Dakota \ud83d\ude2d )", "Tell me you've never smelled a bag of animal shit without telling me. \n\nThe reduction of the reek of shit due to somewhat cold temperatures doesn't actually amount to much when there's *five to six* bags of it all in a pile for *days* on end. \n\nAnd perhaps \"no matter how cold it is\" is an overstatement, but OP has stated that where they live it's currently around 25F. And assuming that they don't live in the Southern Hemisphere or near the equator, it's only *just* starting to get well and truly cold outside. So a pile of 5-6 dog turds sitting out for 6 days is still gonna reek. When I was renting a house I'd occasionally leave a single bag of dog doo-doo out on my porch when I couldn't find my shoes to take it out to the trash, and yeah, you could still smell it the next morning. Nevermind 6 mornings later *and* 5 more bags\n\nAnd ftr, I lived in Vermont for 7 years, where the temperature pretty regularly drops into the negatives in the winter, so I have, in fact, \"been in the cold\". But thanks for the baseless assumption.", "Right? solution here. OP acting like all possible alternatives have been exhausted.", "Not when it\u2019s full lmao. But from when the trash is emptied to the time I get home from work to retrieve the bins, I\u2019m now on bin #4", "How are none of you grasping the fact that brining them inside to a heated, insulated environment is going to make them stink up the entire place. It\u2019s 25 degrees outside. They don\u2019t smell", "It\u2019s not inconvenient for me at all lol and never insinuated it was. It\u2019s right below HIS living space so I thought i was doing him a favor with the smell", "Yes. If they were inside they would stink up my apartment\u2026.they\u2019re outside", "My bad, I was unaware that the theft of dog shit was so rampant in society", "I know, I grew up in fuckin' Minnesota, I can't feel my face at those temps let alone smell something.", "Yeah I mean I have two dogs and we have a special container out back to put them in until garbage day. I live in ON Canada and can tell you in the winter, when I go to put my dogs poop in the poop container, I CAN NOT smell close to 20 bags. It still doesn\u2019t make this better for OP, you shouldn\u2019t leave bags of shit lying around like that. I\u2019m JS when it\u2019s minus 40 out I can not smell ANYTHING except for snow and despair", "That whole thesis and you're still full of shit.", "This is where the diaper genie comes in. You keep it inside. It\u2019s designed specifically to lock in poopy diaper smells. It really works (I can\u2019t speak for any knock-offs). I had twins and no smells related to their diapers until time to empty that sucker came. And it holds lots, so with your tiny bags, it\u2019ll be like once a month emptying it.", "Maybe you could put something else in the bin? I have a small bin outside for doggie bags, but in the bottom of the trash can I put a thin layer of litter box deodorizing crystals or baking soda, etc. to help with the smell inside the can. Maybe if you have something like that in the bottom of the can it\u2019ll appear more dirty and won\u2019t get stolen.", "What exactly do you think people with babies do with dirty diapers? Just pile them at the front door like you?", "Somehow the millions of other people with dogs, cats, and babies manage to find ways to throw out waste without their homes smelling", "I have a cat, and trust me, you can\u2019t beat cat shit for smelliness. OF COURSE I have the bagged poop in a special little bin INSIDE because she\u2019s my pet and my problem, not anyone else\u2019s. YTA.", "How are you not grasping the fact that leaving your dog's shitbags around in the yard is unsanitary and unsightly? Buy an outdoor bin specifically for the dog poop and learn to be a better neighbor.", "And in the summer? What\u2019s your bad excuse than?", " We \"grasp\" your logic and still disagree with your decision and think YTA. Just bc it's cold doesn't mean it's cool to leave your bags of dog poo by your neighbors front door.", "You could possibly find a small metal box or bin with a lid to fit next to your planters to place the poop bags in. Home decor stores usually have things like this for pretty cheap.", "Then at least get another receptacle to put them in, instead of leaving the bags on the steps. A small metal trashcan with a lid, a nice looking flowerpot that you can cover, etc. \n\nI understand your conundrum, but leaving baggies of poop on the stairs is not the solution.", "But leaving biological waste outside for days while your neighbors to have to smell it is A-OK for you? \n\nGet a diaper genie, a trash can with a lid and scented bags, or any of a number of suggestions here, and stop being that neighbor. You know, the inconsiderate one who stores sh\\*t in public and doesn't think they've done anything wrong.\n\nYTA", "Tough shit.", "Do you not tie the bags?", "I don't think anyone anticipated your dedication to keeping bags of shit loosely collected on your floor.\n\nUsually, people will keep trash in bins, even if they're kept inside.\n\nI put my cat's litter waste in a LitterLocker and with the lids closed I can be in the same room and not smell it.", "They don't smell if they're in sealed dog poop bags. It's what I do with cat litter clumps/poop, never been an issue. Just tie the bag tightly shut and put it in a bin with a lid on it. Get a separate bin specifically for the poop bags if you need to.", "If they don't smell, how exaxtly did your neighbor find them? And what the fuck is your plan in 6 months when it *is* hot?", "you\u2019ve can\u2019t comprehend the function of a trash can lid? and you have an attitude? either this post is fake, or you\u2019re a gold medal mental gymnast. enjoy your judgment, please actually change irl.", "Which stinks up...the outside.", "People use the little trash cans for cigarette butts \ntoo I believe. I\u2019m guessing the dog shit isn\u2019t the main attraction lol", "Yeah, I acknowledge that \"no matter how cold it is\" was a bit of an overstatement \ud83d\ude05 that was more meant to be a pointed comment at OP, insisting that 5+ bags of poo left directly in front of the front door for 5+ days straight can't *possibly* smell because it was in the mid-twenties this week where they live. Like, that much poo over that much time definitely does still smell in the mid-twenties. One or two bags of poo, while still AH-ish and gross, would probably not smell noticeably in that temp beyond an occasional unpleasant whiff. But three to six, over as many days? That reek only accumulates over time, and at 23-25 degrees Fahrenheit, you're still gonna be smelling stale dog poo every time you walk in or out of your front door.", "Wow, what an intelligent, sophisticated, and convincing argument that is! Full of compelling objective evidence, too! Clearly we've got a master debater on our hands here!", "Lmao.", "> you\u2019ve can\u2019t comprehend the function of a trash can lid? and you have an attitude?\n\nThis is fantastic, thank you for this, made me genuinely laugh out loud.", "Do me a favor and go shit inside a plastic bag and put it in your kitchen trash and let me know how it smells in a few days. You\u2019re doing mental gymnastics to not be able to comprehend that the smell will still be there regardless of a fucking lid. It\u2019s inside. Trapped. By walls and insulation. And fucking heated. Outside it is not. It\u2019s 25 degrees. It doesn\u2019t smell. It\u2019s winter. The whole purpose of them being outside in the first place is because I\u2019m well aware it will smell inside, with a lid.", "I'm not sure what doggy bags you are using but none of the ones I've used have ever made our trash stink when inside, in our trash, full of doggy poop (and we have GSD who poops like a machine), insulated and heated as you so describe it. I think you either need new baggies or a trashcan designed to prevent smells escaping. Or like. Idk hide a small trashcan outside nearby to put them in? I think there are a lot of solutions to this that don't involve leaving baggies of dog poop just out there vibing for your neighbor to see.", "You wanted to know if you were the asshole. Which you are. Why do you keep defending yourself when your neighbor has clearly expressed his feelings about it? Just put it in the trash", "the kitchen? goalposts are moving already huh?", "And what do you do in the summer?", "You should stop heating your garbage. Likes hot garbage but not hot poop lol how does the rest of your garbage not smell??", "Dude. Maybe you need to buy better bins? Or lids?", "Would love for you to explain how I\u2019m moving goalposts. You said to put the shit inside, in a trash can, with a lid. So I said okay, go shit in your kitchen trash can, yanno bc most people\u2019s kitchen trash cans are located in their kitchen, inside, with a lid", "and was the solution i proposed to shit in your neighbors kitchen? because that\u2019s what you\u2019re insinuating is an equal experiment here. you\u2019re so mad lol, shouldn\u2019t have asked a million people if you were an asshole, you might\u2019ve had a better afternoon!", "No your solution was to move the shit inside. So I told you to shit inside your trash can to see how you like the smell, never once said anything about my neighbors kitchen. I\u2019m having a great afternoon actually, about to be done work, who wouldn\u2019t be happy?"]}
