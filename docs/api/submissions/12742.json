I wasn't thinking about posting this but I wanted to try it and look at the opinions of others. Also please note that english is not my first language.\n\nAbout three months ago I was invited to my nephew's wedding which is gonna take place next week. I'm happy for him and all but the thing is her wife. She ain't exactly the most easy to love or to bond with. Of course I can't speak for the rest of the family but personally I don't like her. Constantly going after me and how I do stuff. Many are the examples but here's just one.\n\nThe first time I met her was when I invited my famiky over for dinner. She showed up without notice and just presented herself as my nephew's girlfriend although he hadn't come. She spent the whole evening criticizing how I cooked and how messy my house was.\n\nIn the family reunions she would always say something about me. Either my clothes were dirty and I should go home and change. How inappropriate it was to drink one beer infront of children. The whole thing without a stop. Even as going as far as telling my family members not to include me during family activities.\n\nNow to the main thing, now that the wedding is right in the corner. They've been making sure everything goes as planned but there's been an inconvenient. After running short with the money they've been trying to look for a place for their honeymoon and they eventually asked me for my cabin. Which I accepted although the short time. While talking about it they also wanted to ask me something else. The wedding was landing during the lent. \n\nWhich is a catholic \"holiday\" to grossly simplify. Apart from many other stuff there's also an oath. During this time me and many family members do a promise to not do something we love or do for the whole lent which is 40 days. My oath is to not shave my beard during this whole time period. This is something I've been doing for almost all my life starting when I was 15. I don't know if other people do it but it's something we do. \n\nThe thing is that she wants me to shave my beard. Saying \"it just looks bad, and i don't want people thinking that there's a hobo in my wedding\" . Straight up, nothing else but that. I denied it saying how important it is for me. We went on a full argument which ended up with her putting an ultimatum saying that she wouldn't invite me if I didn't shave it. I said I wouldn't lend them my cabin if I wasn't invited. Which made the whole thing even worse. Finally I kicked them out of my house. Yes my nephew was there but he never spoke up.

I would have also taken my hobo cabin off the table.", "What is wrong with this girl!? So many red flags,  I don't know where to start...\n\nLet's start with NTA.\n\nIts your beard, you can keep it or shave it. That's YOUR choice not hers. Her wedding is her day. That has nothing to do with you. She can keep you out of pictures or whatever. Who cares. \n\nBut who did she think she is that she can complain about your beard!?  Let alone insult your religious traditions... You don't tell her how short to cut her hair or how to express her religous faith. What is wrong with her?\n\nI hope your nephew reigns that attitude in a little. I'm sure they'd love to have you at the wedding. I personally wouldn't be so gracious with my cabin given the attitude though, but that's just me.", "Everyone my apologies I putted grandson in the title, I intended to put nephew.", "NTA. You reacted perfectly. Stand your ground.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t even want to be involved with their wedding, let alone letting them stay in your cabin for their honeymoon.\n\nShe\u2019s a judgmental leach, the entire time you\u2019ve known her.", "NTA.\n\nYour beard and your face are YOURS. Nobody on Earth should be trying to control how you look or how you present yourself. If there was a color scheme in the wedding and you went outside of it, that would be a different story. But your beard is doing nothing at all to harm anyone or to change anything significant about the wedding.\n\nI\u2019m an ex-Catholic, but I understand how important Lenten promises can be. I would never ask anyone to break their promise, even if I don\u2019t understand it personally.\n\nAnd on top of all of that, from what you\u2019ve told us, it seems like the fianc\u00e9e has it out for you. It\u2019s very childish and silly of her to victimize herself in all of this at the risk of your relationship with your grandson.", "NTA, if i was in your position i wouldnt even go to the wedding let alone help them with their honeymoon! She sounds like a nightmare. Dont shave your beard", "NTA. She is not in charge of your beard. If she shows so little respect for you and such displeasure for how you keep your home; surely she won\u2019t be happy with your cabin either. How dare she even ask after how she\u2019s treated you. I\u2019m sorry your nephew is with her, as this is how she will eventually treat him. He just doesn\u2019t realize it yet. Very sad.", "NTA Your nephew's fiancee sounds positively delightful, a real charmer. People are not props in someone's wedding. And, you have to be a special little doodle bug to show up at someone's home and demean them, demand they change their appearance or they'll revoke your invitation to the wedding and expect a favor.Stand your ground, no invitation, no cabin and stay home and drink a beer in front of child in a t-shirt with a stain to celebrate!", "NTA - in your place I would not shave my beard or share my cabin!", "NTA she clearly doesn't like you, she's the ass here.", "NTA She sounds like an exhausting nightmare, your poor nephew. Just don\u2019t go to the wedding and let her figure out another honeymoon spot. Sucks for your nephew for you not to be there but his not standing up to her nonsense is ridiculous.", "NTA she sounds like an absolute delight. I wouldn't lend that uppity B a thing.", "NTA and you did exactly right. Your body, your beard, your decision about shaving or not. She sounds like she has no respect for you whatsoever - if it wasn't the beard, I'm sure it would have been something else (clothes you intended to wear weren't clean/stylish enough, etc.). \n\nIt's amazing that they (she counts for both of them since your grandson doesn't speak up) think they can use your property while uninviting you to the event! You handled it right. There is no way you should lend them your cabin if you are 1) not invited, or 2) even invited, but still disrespected in how you're treated.", "NTA at all", "NTA. your beard, your body is your choice, not hers. if she wants to give you an ultimatum, it's your decision to turn the table on her regarding the cabin.", "NTA That's your beard and your cabin. She'd probably continue to treat you like trash throughout the entire wedding. Grab some beer and go chill at your cabin instead.", "You did the right thing, I don't think it's right for anyone despite their religion or culture to disrespect the elders of their lovers family unless they are treated the way you say she's treats you. Eye for an eye is one thing but that's just disgraceful. Good in you.", "NTA\n\nYour nephew's girlfriend sounds like she has something against you in particular, which is especially bad because she turned around wanting to use your cabin. Good on you to stand up for yourself.", "NTA - your nephew's fianc\u00e9 is the AH. And quite frankly, your nephew should have stepped up. You have a religious protocol that you have followed for years. She needs to respect that. As for the cabin, good for you! I'll bet dollars to doughnuts that marriage won't last more than a couple years. If you are uninvited, it will not be much of a loss. Hopefully your nephew will see her for who she truly is before he says, \"I do\". good luck! Please keep us updated :)", "NTA  \nshe was being disrespectful and hurtful you had every right to kick them out. Also the fact that she has gone so far as to try and get other family members to exclude you is unacceptable, she is completely out of line. Stand your ground and do not lend them your cabin. they clearly have no respect or care for your feelings and that's not how a family should act.", "INFO:  So I guess the question is, do any of her criticisms have any truth to them?  How are you dressed at these family reunions?  Is she right - do you look dirty?  How many beers do you have - is it to the point where you\u2019re drunk in front of the kids?\n\nAnd how well-maintained is your beard?  Is it neat and trimmed, or uneven and scraggly?  She can\u2019t tell you to shave your beard, but if you\u2019re planning to go to a wedding without being neat and clean, then you\u2019d be the AH.  Otherwise, she is.", "First of all is it your grandson or your nephew? Honestly, you don't sound like a man old enough to be a grandfather. Something just doesn't sound right to me here.", "Sooo... Is it your nephew or your grandson who is getting married?\n\nIf you're going to troll, at least be consistent", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
