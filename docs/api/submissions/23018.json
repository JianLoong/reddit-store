Mommy and Daddy pay part of his expenses and you pay the rest. You'll be paying all of them when he talks you into letting him move him without a full time job. Because his parents won't feel obligated to pay when he's not living with them anymore. \n\nAny day now,  he's going to have a fight with his parents or some other excuse and he'll need a place to live. It's already paid for by you. \n\nSo you're NTA for expecting him to get a job. But you are one for putting with his crap. \n\nSo what does he a actually do with his money besides occasionally buy groceries? Drugs, expensive hobbies, another girlfriend?", "NTA. Read your comment back to yourself. Find someone with the same work ethic and goals as yourself. Drop the hobosexual.", "Your partner is supposed to be a **partner** not a parasite", "NTA - make it a boundary and defend it. You don't want to be sugar-mommying/enabling a toddler who just gets to sleep in and play video games all day... as great as he is and as much as you love him, he can't be the partner you want if he doesn't match your drive too. And pay his share. Want to take him on vacations? Want to buy him his next car? Clothes?\n\nAnd watch out for relationship creep - you might find him moved in gradually over a few months and find yourself there accidentally in a regular old boiled frog kind of way!", "Listen to your inner heart and obey all the red flags you see.\n\nThen Run!\n\nRun fast and free. Run as far as the sea.\n\nWhen you stop, you can make a list of the qualities you want and need in a man.\n\nNTA.", "This man may get a full-time job in the short-term to get his foot in the door, but will never be the equal partner you're looking for. He's happy to free-load off whoever he can. Right now, it's mostly his parents and a little bit you. One day, it will be some poor woman. Don't let that be you. Good luck to you. NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown adult who is still living like a child. \nDating someone like that is exhausting and it\u2019s an opportunity to see if he wants to continue to be a failure to launch or will become an adult.\nYou will absolutely have to supprt him otherwise, like you sort of are now. \nWhat your relationship is now is what it will be when you move in together. Is that what you want in a partner?", "Do not let him move in with you until he has a full-time job, can fulfill his half of the bills and understands that you absolutely will not be writing lists of jobs for him to do around the apartment. I can 100% guarantee that this is one of those \"Well, if you just tell me what needs doing, I'll do it\" guys. If you let him move in without the above conditions, you will be taking care of him for the next couple of years until you finally realise that he's a leech and kick him out. NTA.", "NTA. If he\u2019s spending 5 nights a week at your apartment, he should be contributing to bills and groceries at the very least.

Not sure if he needs to get a full time job but maybe rearranging how he spends his money could help already? But then you would still be left with someone who is home a lot and you need to figure out if you'd be okay with that.", "NTA. Not even a little bit. I would start limiting his time over at your apartment. One day you'll wake up and find that he's moved himself in completely without your permission.", "NTA \n\nHold firm, he is sliding down hill and his parents are not doing him any favors. If he won't get a job, give him a deadline and don't allow him over after the deadline.", "NTA. It\u2019s not unreasonable at all. If he doesn\u2019t want to get a FT job and show he can live on his own without mooching off you, it might be time to consider if this relationship is compatible. You sound like a hard worker and will be able to find somebody willing to put in the work to be with you.", "It's ok to expect this from a partner.  Lay out your needs very clearly, including how often he's allowed to sleep over without contributing.  He'll either step up or not. If he doesn't,  then you know he values his free time more than your relationship.  \n\nThis would be different if he was trying to better himself in some way like schooling or apprenticeship,  but you didn't mention any of that so I'm assuming he's just chilling through life right now. \n\nNTA", "NTA - and you need to make this your hill to die on; unless you want someone acting like a blood sucking leach as a partner.", "NTA. He likes having the best of every world while contributing almost nothing. It\u2019s a great life if you can get it.", "NTA stick to the requirement, for your own financial security. Even consider once he has that full-time job, try to get him to practice moving the amount he'd need for monthly bills into a savings account to make sure he's able to budget properly. Fully discuss splitting finances before moving a single item of his into your place. There's so many horror stories on here about couples cohabitating without making sure their finances are squared away first", "NTA, if you back down from this you W B T A. This is a hill to die on, if he's not willing to get a full time job, which he should have done years ago, he's not ready for a grown up relationship.", "NTA. At 26 he should be full time employment unless he is still studying. Time he grew up and got on his grind and found his purpose. I would definitely make it a condition of him moving in that he needs to be able to afford to share all costs equally. Buying a few groceries that he also consumes doesn\u2019t quite cut it. Living out of home is expensive and I don\u2019t think he appreciates how much it is. I would say you would only grow to resent him if it continued giving you are working long hours.", "Do not let him move in full time. He's already beginning to; you need to stand firm. He doesn't see a reason to get a FT job because his parents have paid for everything he has needed up until he met you, and you are now paying for the other things he needs.\n\nUntil he can show you that he's willing to do something other than freeload off of you, do not move forward with him. NTA", "NTA But if he has this little ambition on his own what would a life be like with him going forward?  You would have to be his mommy prodding him to pull his weight all the time?  That will be a big problem between you.  You will resent him for his laziness and lack of ambition and resentment is a relationship killer.", "Sigh. NTA. Break up with him. Lots of posts like this on AITA lately... come on! Drop these deadbeats!", "NTA.  I'm pretty sure there's a TLC song about this that tells you all you need to know/do about the situation", "NTA\nYour boyfriend will freeload until you give him an ultimatum, you deserve better.", "You are NTA and you're smart to nip this in the bud NOW. Good for you for not wanting to tolerate this. He's looking for a free place to crash.", "NTA\n\nYou're looking for partner material and so far he's showing himself as \"leech\" material. \n\nYou want an equal in your life not a child to take care of. \n\nNot only are you Not The Asshole, I would consider this a viability test for long term future of your relationship.", "NTA. But! He is showing you who he is.", "He's 26 and his parents still provide pretty much everything for him?  Sounds like the only thing he doesn't get from them is sex.  A full time job isn't what he needs. He needs to grow up.  You can't help him do that.", "NTA\nIt seems like a fair solution, obviously you need some type of show from him that he will not be stucking you with all bills and responsibilities when he moves in. Does he contribute with cooking, cleaning etc? Does he seem like he knows what it requires to be an adult in your own home in general?\nThe fact that he is 26, still lives at home and with no savings despite a job is giving me red flags.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't unreasonable. If he gives you any push-back or complaints about full time work to contribute to household FULL TIME, please understand he's showing you who he is and where his priorities are at this time in his life and you need to make a decision based on that and not how you feel about him. Is he going to KEEP a full time job? Is he going to be DEPENDABLE in paying his portion of bills?", "NTA and not gonna lie, you may want to tell him you need him to not only have a full time job but to live on his own for a time (at least a year) where he has to manage everything himself.  Otherwise he may/likely will treat you as his second mother and that is fun for no one.  \n\nTo be clear, going straight from parents to a shared space with a partner is not inherently bad, but the fact that he has no bills and is broke is really concerning for the future.  This says to me that he would expect you to take care of everything.  For me, I don\u2019t care how good a partner was, this would be a deal breaker.\n\nDon\u2019t trap yourself OP, he needs to prove he can behave as an adult before you take your next step.", "Have a discussion about what he does with his finand how much he actually makes. According to you, he doesn't seem very motivated. So why would you have him move in?", "Please do not let this man move in with you. He\u2019s looking for someone to replace his mommy. You do not want to be tied down to a mamas boy.", "ESH.  \n\nHe's a leech, you're enabling it.  If this actually matters to you, you need to put more on the line than whether he gets to move in (the rest of the week - he already lives with you half time).  His parents may be happy to support him for now, but there's no reason that has to continue.  Picture him being cut off by them and you supporting him because there isn't anyone else.", "NTA, but working 3/4 days a week is normal with my friend group. It\u2019s more important that he\u2019s helping to pay bills/rent not how much he works", "ESH. He has his life set up perfectly right now, he gets everything he wants from his parents and you. He is not remotely interested in working more or paying his own way: he intends you to do it entirely once he moves in. You're an enabler already, and he likes that and doesn't want it to change. \n\nDo not let him move in, stop feeding him as if he were your child, and I'd seriously reconsider your relationship overall. He's a lazy freeloader who's lying to you.", "NTA do not let him move in", "Girl...NTA!  It is not unreasonable to make sure someone who wants to live with you can pay their way!  How is he always broke if he has no bills?  Red flag!  Not only can he not afford to pay his own way, but he can't manage his money.  Do not let him move in!", "OMG!  NTA, but this guy is using you.  Get rid of him!", "He\u2019s not going to get a full time job because you and his parents are supporting him. Before you even entertain the idea of living together he needs to be working full time and he needs to have all his expenses put in his name and paid for. And he needs to do this for months before the topic of moving in together gets brought up again. You are NTA for wanting to move in with an adult who has shown they can handle adult responsibilities. You aren\u2019t being controlling or trying to change him. You are really asking for the bare minimum here.", "NTA.  And good for you for setting a hard boundary; however, I would still be careful.  He could easily get a job and 3 months after moving in decide it's not for him and quit.  He also would not have free reign in my apartment while I'm working.  You're not his personal crash pad.", "Listen to the song No Scrubs by TLC on repeat until you dump his buster ass.", "I don't think YTA but if he doesn't want to get a ft job then move on and find someone who has one and he'll find someone who doesn't care", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
