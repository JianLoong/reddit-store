Obviously if I've misinterpreted and OP is implying that his wife is working less overall then it's an easy Y T A vote, but I didn't read it that way so I didn't vote it as such.", "Not implied, you inferred that's what they meant.\n\nImply would be for the OP to suggest the mother only does part time labour and that looking after the child for 2 days is not work.\n\nInferring is your interpretation of what they meant, which is exactly what you did as they provided no further context and you did not ask any follow up questions.", "I absolutely get where you're coming from, you can easily interpret the statement either way, but I think the mental addition of \"only\" that you've added when reading that sentence massively swings the interpretation to the 'being a dick about how much work his wife is doing' side instead of the plausible 'explaining where their time goes'.\n\nThere are for sure many dads who don't pull their weight and expect the mothers to do all the childcare and/or don't respect the amount of effort that goes into raising a child, but I didn't get that vibe from OP from the rest of the post so it pushed me to thinking they were giving context rather than being an ass.", "That's what husband and I do and it really is two full time jobs each.", "Yes, I agree having one boy was challenging. When my niece came over, he was distracted thus cooking meals, cleaning house was way easier on the weekends. Thankful our public preschool program had an aftercare program, making it feasible to restart a career \ud83e\udd7a", "Understandably upset for having to do 2 nights of night time waking after her spouse has done months.....That's not \"understandably upset\" that's \"I've had the nigh times with our current child easy\"", "Yes and he has stepped up every single night except for two.", "The snoring, the maternity pillow hogging the bed, the constant change in sleeping position and the constant on and off of the cover over the night.

But for all we know this once a year event is important. I mean surely it is if it took a week of preparation. So characterising it as missing one party probably isn't fair. It could be the most important work related event of the year. If its a once a year all day conference with a week of prep time it probably involved things along the lines of presentations, networking, courting clients, doing things that influence the next year of work and his overall career in general. Sitting down with people to talk over some drinks might be huge in his industry. \n\nIt's not like his career exists in a vacuum. They're working together and sucess at work and higher income is something they both presumably want when they're raising 2 kids as long as there's a balance between work and life. It's not a situation of \"well pregnancy and kids isn't good for my career, so your career should suffer too to make us even\". She isn't vindictive about it like your comment suggests.\n\nThe issue was that he never asked for her to cover 2 nights that after this week of extra work and stress, she only agreed to 1 night. Her point was completely valid and she should have some time to herself without childcare to make up for it. This is a relationship, not an antagonistic encounter. It's not pregnant woman vs man. They're working together as a family.

Replacing the lost household income can wait", "He states \u201cI got home around midnight after the all day conference having had a few drinks\u201d. The conference did not go until 11. And if there was a planned networking event he would have scheduled that with her beforehand.  \n\nRemember, she\u2019s not mad that he stayed out or drank, it\u2019s that he made it her problem while she\u2019s growing a human.", "I'm aware of what he wrote but it could be used as a replacement for what she actually said since this is AITA. Still, no indication of tone.", "Agree. Often the person who is drunk doesn't realize that they have become too drunk to handle their duties, and once they are in that state they are essentially another dependent creature in the household. We can't know what OP's wife's drinking habits are when she's not pregnant, but a lot of times there is one partner who will go harder than another and never realizes how annoying they become to wrangle after drinking. If she's on 6 months without a drink, caring for a toddler and working and pregnant, having her partner get too drunk to function is likely more irritating than just being tired. It's a situation OP created that now the wife has to clean up, and that feels inconsiderate in a different way.", "You sound dreadful. This conference was a lot of work for OP and caused a ton of stress. So what if he lets loose a bit after its all over. It is one night and its not like he gets drunk all the time. His wife can let him have this one night especially since he's been nicely getting up more in the middle of the night due to her being in her third trimester so she can sleep longer", "And that\u2019s what all of this really comes down to. Jealousy.", "She chose a life where she can\u2019t drink temporarily then he chose a life where he can\u2019t over indulge temporarily because he has committed to letting his wife sleep at night while she makes the enormous sacrifice of growing their child. Just because he doesn\u2019t have a physical limitation on his drinking doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist.", "Well, then you can deal with a hungover husband, a cranky toddler, and all the other household responsibilities for your house if you get pregnant if that's fair to you. That's your prerogative in your relationship. Go ahead and set those standards for you. But this doesn't work for a lot of other people because they want reliable partners who will be there for them, especially for the 9 months *the father chose* to have a baby. \n\nThis was not a \"special occasion\" in my book. It's work. It wasn't a birthday or a celebration for a friend. It was work. And like I said, my husband did drink when I was pregnant. But he never did to excess, especially when I was in the third trimester. If you are fine watching your husband get shitty while you are sitting in bed crying from heartburn or the million other reasons pregnancy sucks, unable to sleep due to it, and your husband can't go help the toddler because he got drunk with the boys after work, then remind yourself you thought it was fair.\n\nAlso, the wife did not unilaterally chose to get pregnant. This isn't the virgin Mary we're talking about. The husband and wife chose to get pregnant together. It takes two to tango and just because a woman gets pregnant doesn't mean her husband doesn't have any responsibility to make sure he's on top of his shit.", "I will just assume that both parties wanted to have kids. There\u2019s a difference between having a drink and being so tipsy you can no longer be a caregiver. \n\nBecause OP had a big work conference that means a lot of childcare and housework (which is still work) fell on OP\u2019s wife. I work FT but my husband works more hours on his weeks on, so I\u2019m the primary caregiver/parent most of the time.

His post says the he was tired from the conference and still feeling the effects of the alcohol, not that he was so drunk he couldn't take care of him. Like you said, he was exhausted from the long week and needed help for this one task. The alcohol honestly doesn't matter. Based on his post, the reason he didn't want to take care of the kid had very little to do with the alcohol. People are assuming that he was extremely drunk just because he said he was \"very tipsy,\" but I'm taking the post at face value.

You seem like a fun person.\n\nI said she should've prepared for something she knew was going to happen. Unless the fact that the conference had alcohol at it was a secret or he didn't tell her, which I find unlikely. If she knew he was going to be drinking, then she should've prepared for the idea that he might not want to take care of their kid if he woke up.\n\nAlso, why are people acting like drinking is some sort of awful act he should be punished for? He was drinking at a conference where drinking was accepted and encouraged. Sure, that doesn't mean he HAS to, but it also wasn't a \"poor decision.\" Shocking twist here, but adults drink. Especially at events. Unless you're 12, you should know this", "Of course OP is referencing labor, not pay. Because pay is irrelevant to the situation. If he is referring to pay instead of labor than that is worse because then it is very manipulative to bring up that sort of irrelevant info to make his contribution seem more significant and hers less.", "It's also such a funny coincidence how much longer partner poops take once you have children. It's a \"forward the mail\" situation.", "I do think that. When one partner works during the day and the other parents all day the nights should be split IMO", "I feel like we can take it at face value that he meant it literally. There's also only so many tones you can call someone an AH when you're upset with them. \n\nBut agree to disagree, I suppose.", "I mean it's an INFO then, if she called him an asshole then NTA if she didnt NAH.

I can't speculate too much on the entirety of their relationship, but it sounds like they're pretty much nailing it.\n\nThese comments, like you said, are ridiculous, almost like they expect being pregnant and having kids to be an antagonistic relationship.

He requires something to keep busy, occasional food, occasional drink, occasional diaper changes, and something to keep him busy.  This is not \"hard work.\"  It's what you sign up for when you become a parent.\n\nIf you don't want to do it, don't have kids.  But stop pretending like caregiving for a semi-mobile little person is on the same level as actually putting in work at a real job.  It's nowhere near as difficult, and if you actually give a shit, it doesn't even feel like work. \n\nShe has to stay up for an hour on two consecutive nights?\n\nOh, what fucking horror!\n\nMeanwhile, she could have been taking a nap at the same time the toddler was to catch up on sleep.  Because, you know, the toddler is going to have a nap during the day.", "I agree with everything you said but I do feel the need to point out he only asked for 1 night and took two. He also could have had the forethought that maybe drinking while he was committed to taking care of the kid for the night wasn't the best idea. That being said, I do agree NTA. They're both parents and while the wife is definitely doing a lot already getting up one time isn't going to be the death of her.", "Even more of a reason he should have cleared it first, since you\u2019d think he\u2019d know what to expect.\n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole, but come on. The guy was still feeling drunk at 3am. That\u2019s probably more than a couple of drinks for most people.", "You are angry that ppl think pregnant women should be treated as if they are disabled. I'm angry that no one gets that being informed way too late is the real issue here. Going out drinking every once in a while is not a problem. But going out drinking spontaneously and then springing a duty on someone else the moment that duty has to be done is not okay.", "Maybe if he never helped out, but it sounds like they have a pretty equitable split caring for the little guy with him being up every time the kid wakes up, minus this 1-2 day period.", "Yeah, but would you tell people completely seriously that you both work two full time jobs?", "I wish I could have gotten \"maturity leave.\""]}
