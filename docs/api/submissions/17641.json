She took over the night she was supposed to no complaints, then OP comes home the next night and is too drunk to do the parenting duties he\u2019s supposed to and that\u2019s just shit happens?? When you\u2019re a parent who has to take care of a kid at home you stop drinking before you go too far.

You\u2019re making excuses for her to do EVERYTHING just because he has a job. He did not actually ask her to get up with the kid that night until he was woken up after drinking.  It\u2019s so weird that people think he should get extra help all week with all of his child care duties (she also took over his pick up and drop off the entire week and still had work herself) and then ALSO be able to skip a night because he decided to go out drinking after work!  That was a decision he made to unwind after his event, and he knew he was sacrificing sleep when he decided to do that.  It\u2019s not her responsibility to cover a night of drinking.", "She does all other childcare needs besides over night (she also dropped off and picked up the entire week, his only other childcare responsibility).

You have no idea what their evenings look like after school before bedtimes and if she works part time and him full time, not as a result of the pregnancy, then in that case it would be a fair balance anyway?

It's selfish. \n\nAlso she had been taking over other duties because he said he had to be in the office more.

These people have to maintain a sustainable life while parenting, for many years to come. So do all parents. It means that sometimes one parent will be taking on more parenting duties, and sometimes people should be given the benefit of the doubt.
