He graduated college at the age of 22 and since then, he has been living rent and responsibility free with us. He works two jobs so he is out of the house from 7 am - 10 pm Monday through Friday and his mother still does almost everything for him.  She cooks his meals to take to work and washes his dishes when he comes home.  She even continues to wash his clothes.\n\nLast summer, he invited his friend with, benefits (he makes it clear she isn't his girlfriend), who lives in Peru, to stay with us for a month and while she was here, he would continue to work all day, leaving us with the responsibility for feeding and entertaining her.  The first time she stayed with us, I got into a big argument with my wife about it being time for him to either move out or start paying rent.  She refused and said that until he's in a stable relationship or has a family, he can stay.  Well, his FWB got pregnant on the first visit and gave birth in February.\n\nOn Sunday, my wife told me that the FWB and the baby would be coming to stay for 5 weeks starting today.  That led to another argument where I said it was time for him to find his own place and now she said that she didn't remember saying last summer that he should leave once he has a family.  She refused to tell him to leave. While normally I leave the parenting decisions around my stepson to his mother, in this case I spoke to him directly and told him that it's time for him to form his own household.  Since he's been working two jobs for a while and has almost no bills, plus he recently inherited a bunch of money, there isn't a financial obstacle to him buying a house or renting an apartment.  He said he'll start looking at houses this weekend. My wife got super pissed when she found out I told him this.  AITA for talking to him directly instead of leaving it to my wife?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My 30 year old stepson has never paid rent or had responsibilities in the house.

As a South American, I will say it's common for our parents to let us, their children, live with them until we get married, and most of us don't pay rent (unless the household actually needs that extra income, ofc). It's cultural. So I understand and agree with your wife about letting him stay before.\n\nBut once the children are grown-up, have a partner and children of their own, they usually move out to their own home. Your wife knows this, as does your stepson.

You need to agree on a course of an action and than go ahead.\n\nActing unilaterally wont work, as than she can and will do the same.\n\nI am sorry, I dont really know what choices you have, but I do think this course of action will cause more stress", "NTA you have a giant wife problem. You gave her too much free reign. I would never have let him live with you for so long. And her doing everything for him like he was a child isn't gonna make things better.

Your wife needs to let him be an adult.", "Eventually even NAH, stepson might simply live to different cultural norms concerning living with parents and might have appreciated a clear communication of OPs values and interests - OP makes it sound like a conversation between two adults which is the textbook way to handle these situations.\n\nGood on ya, OP.", "That\u2019s not true for anyone else in my wife\u2019s family.

The question at hand is about the method.\n\nYou did this with out your wife's consent, in fact, against her expressed wishes. The correct method here would be further conversations with your wife, not just going around her.", "NTA.  You don't really have a stepson problem. You have a wife problem.\n\n.", "NTA.", "NTA, He is more than old enough to lead his own life.  There are so many unanswered questions.  Does he pay for his own food that his mom makes for him?  Does your wife work?  If she does, how does she find time to do all of this for him-does she let other things go undone?    You said that he has lived with you since he came here from Peru, does he have citizenship?  This could make it harder to get a mortgage.", "NTA. At 30 with a job and a baby, you were just having an adult-to-adult conversation with a roommate. The circumstances of his life changed so now the living situation needs to be updated. Your wife, accordingly, can decide which roommate she wants to be with.", "NTA, might I suggest, that he either picks up chores or starts paying rent, if finding a house or apartment doesn't work out?\n\nAlso, NOTHING turns women off faster in western countries than someone still living with their parents... He will find a family faster, if he lives alone.\n\nIt also helps to know how to do laundry and cook and clean, when he gets married. He can help out his wife during pregnancy and if she gets sick or dies, he's NOT the 70 year old idiot, who lives in a dump...\n\n(That's the reasons I would give your wife. She seems to want grandkids one day or more grandkids. You are just helping her chances of making that true.)", "NTA. Looks like the stepson understood, and there's no issue on his side. Your wife needs to let go and accept that her baby is going to be a father, and his family would need their own space.", "Your wife wants him to be a mommas boy forever.  If he's old enough to father a child, he's old enough to support his significant other and baby in his own house or apartment, especially since he's okay financially.  NTAH.", "NTA\n\nGiven how well your stepson took the conversation, I almost wonder if he was a little relieved to hear it.  I get that it's a comfortable arrangement for him, but I also wonder if he's gotten the impression his mother would be angry if he left.  An accurate one, it seems, if so.  So it's easier to just stay (because, again, it's been a pretty sweet arrangement for him).\n\nIt is *long* past time she gets on board with him leaving the nest, and not guilt either you or him over it.\n\nAnd yep, the good news is, it sounds like he'll be on a reasonably firm financial footing, so once he flies he's likely to stay flown.  Why doesn't your wife want that for him?", "NTA", "Your wife disagrees. Your stepson isn't going anywhere. Good luck with this.", "The wife was the one who was acting unilaterally first though. OP wanted to come up with a timeline and game plan for when stepson would move out, wife wouldn't hear anything of it and **unilaterally decided** that stepson would simply never have to move out. She pretends to compromise the first time by saying \"oh when he has his own family we'll have him move out\" only to renege on that once the \"has his own family\" requirement has been met and now claims she never agreed to that. \n\nAt that point, if the wife isn't willing to budge on the subject literally at all and will manipulate her husband to keep things her way, then OP is more than in the right to go and talk with stepson directly about the situation. Especially seeing as stepson isn't a child any more and deserves to be involved in the discussion anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult talking to another adult. Relation doesn't matter. \n\nSince you're married and living under the same roof, this impacts you and you have the right as a rent/mortgage contributor (INFO: Not sure if it's your house or under both of your names) to talk to someone living under YOUR roof who's not paying for anything.\n\nI have kinda the reverse. My mom lives with me and my husband. She is widowed and doesn't have the greatest paying job. She pays what she can, and I'm happy to help because she's always done her best to provide for me in my youth.\n\nYour 30 year old step son needs to grow tf up and get his life together. He claims that FWB isn't his gf, but gets her pregnant? Serious red flags there.\n\nYour wife is enabling this and eventually when you both get older, who will help out? Not this entitled 30y/o kid. I'm in agreement with the other posters who say this is moreso a wife problem.\n\nIn most multi-generational cultures, I see the KIDS helping the PARENTS when they get older, not the reverse. If I have this wrong, please do correct me.", "NTA, but don't be surprised if your wife moves out with him.  She doesn't want to cut the apron strings.", "Info: what is her reasoning for wanting him stay and who owns the house?", "You're NTA. But your wife's actions are not abnormal to me at all. Latin families are usually attached by the hip. Letting her son go must sound completely unnatural to her, just as having him around is to you. It's great that he actually understood where you're coming from, but I think you and wife need a good talk about culture and also, expectations.", "NTA but is suspect mom is going to go with him and fleece her husband for all he\u2019s worth.", "What took you so long??? Maybe it would be good for you if his mother went with him! Are you done being used and walked on by this \"family\"?? I'm thinking that you deserve better!!", "I also kinda wonder if the step-son felt obligated to be that close to his mom. Some mom's don't know what to do when their son leaves.  \nSpeaking from personal experience, my husband's mom kept him super close and even ruined a few of his early relationships because she wanted him to always be at her side.\n\nI helped him get his driver's license (back when we were in our 20's), helped him make a resume, and even drive him to interviews. Now, he's about to start into a management role. \n\nHis mom HATED me for the longest time. Now, she acts all nice to me. \n\nI'd say this is the push the step-son needs to get out on his own.", "I also believe it's a cultural thing. Very common in some countries in latin America. NAH."]}
