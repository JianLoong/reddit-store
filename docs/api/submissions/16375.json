He graduated college at the age of 22 and since then, he has been living rent and responsibility free with us. He works two jobs so he is out of the house from 7 am - 10 pm Monday through Friday and his mother still does almost everything for him.  She cooks his meals to take to work and washes his dishes when he comes home.  She even continues to wash his clothes.\n\nLast summer, he invited his friend with, benefits (he makes it clear she isn't his girlfriend), who lives in Peru, to stay with us for a month and while she was here, he would continue to work all day, leaving us with the responsibility for feeding and entertaining her.  The first time she stayed with us, I got into a big argument with my wife about it being time for him to either move out or start paying rent.  She refused and said that until he's in a stable relationship or has a family, he can stay.  Well, his FWB got pregnant on the first visit and gave birth in February.\n\nOn Sunday, my wife told me that the FWB and the baby would be coming to stay for 5 weeks starting today.  That led to another argument where I said it was time for him to find his own place and now she said that she didn't remember saying last summer that he should leave once he has a family.  She refused to tell him to leave. While normally I leave the parenting decisions around my stepson to his mother, in this case I spoke to him directly and told him that it's time for him to form his own household.  Since he's been working two jobs for a while and has almost no bills, plus he recently inherited a bunch of money, there isn't a financial obstacle to him buying a house or renting an apartment.  He said he'll start looking at houses this weekend. My wife got super pissed when she found out I told him this.  AITA for talking to him directly instead of leaving it to my wife?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My 30 year old stepson has never paid rent or had responsibilities in the house.

As a South American, I will say it's common for our parents to let us, their children, live with them until we get married, and most of us don't pay rent (unless the household actually needs that extra income, ofc). It's cultural. So I understand and agree with your wife about letting him stay before.\n\nBut once the children are grown-up, have a partner and children of their own, they usually move out to their own home.
