He moved out on his 18th birthday and never looked back.  \n\nMaybe his experience colors my answer.  But having now seen it from the POV of a parent too, I think that at some point (And under normal circumstances), you have to let go and trust that you're teaching your kids right.

If the parents confront her and ask why she isn't using her diary as much anymore, she can just tell them she's lost interest in it, and not tell them about the new one (if they want to encourage sneaky behaviour then your neice might as well put it to good use, I think protecting your right to privacy falls into that).", "Thank you.

But, even if they don't find out, that doesn't make it any less wrong.\n\nMaybe you wouldn't have cared if your parents had read your diary (if you kept one), but I would have been mortified and extremely angry.

Find a good one.", "A lockbox and a journal with a combination lock", "think about your niece man how would she feel if she found out someone KNEW her parents were reading her most private thoughts and just didn't tell her", "My mother used to read my livejournal when i was a depressed teen. It came from a place of concern about me (which was very well justified) and tbh at the time i was too depressed to really care once i figured it out. \n\nBut i did start modifying what i wrote bearing in mind that she'd see it. Not lying, but more like talking about things that were too difficult or awkward to bring up in person. And it actually helped our relationship a lot, i think. For example, if there was a difficult moment at home, i could write my side and my feelings without being interrupted or even having to be that tactful (it was, after all, just me talking to myself, right?). I wrote about my sexuality and the people (male and female) that i was interested in, or starting to date. So when i 'came out' and brought a girl home for the first time, my parents were already primed for it.\n\nBut my mother was always very accepting and while i did have firm boundaries as a little kid, as a teen there was almost nothing to rebel against because she trusted me to behave responsibly so she let me go out, have parties, stay over with friends, dye my hair blue, paint my bedroom blood red, etc. I think a controlling parent would be more likely to punish their kid if they read something that they didn't like.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, my mother still thinks i don't know that she was reading my journal and i don't plan on telling her because i know she was terrified about my moving away to university when i was so unwell, and it probably gave her a lot of comfort to read about his things were 'really' going. I think she was wrong to invade my privacy, but i understand why she did it. We're really close these days. She's the best parent i could have wished for \n\nAnyway, my point was that if you let your niece know her parents are reading her diary, she can adjust what she writes. Either use it to talk to them like i did, or just be aware that what she's writing isn't private.\n\nIf you don't want to outright tell her, how about a story about a 'friend' of yours who kept two diaries as a kid; one for their parents to find, and one super-hidden real one.

When he is older I will remove it", "If your niece suddenly stops writing in her current journal, her parents might start snooping for a new one. Same goes for an online one. If Niece starts an online one, it needs to be well hidden because if the paper journaling suddenly stops, the parents might go looking for where she's writing her thoughts. \n\nIf you do give Niece a new, lockable one or suggest an online one, I would encourage her to continue writing boring, inane stuff in the old paper one to throw them off. \n\nYou should also be prepared for your Niece to figure out that her parents are reading her journal, that's why your offering more secure choices, even if you don't outright say it.", "Nta. Tell her.  Then educate her.  Let her know she can get an online, password protected journal.
