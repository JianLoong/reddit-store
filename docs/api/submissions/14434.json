But having now seen it from the POV of a parent too, I think that at some point (And under normal circumstances), you have to let go and trust that you're teaching your kids right.

It came from a place of concern about me (which was very well justified) and tbh at the time i was too depressed to really care once i figured it out. \n\nBut i did start modifying what i wrote bearing in mind that she'd see it. Not lying, but more like talking about things that were too difficult or awkward to bring up in person. And it actually helped our relationship a lot, i think. For example, if there was a difficult moment at home, i could write my side and my feelings without being interrupted or even having to be that tactful (it was, after all, just me talking to myself, right?). I wrote about my sexuality and the people (male and female) that i was interested in, or starting to date. So when i 'came out' and brought a girl home for the first time, my parents were already primed for it.\n\nBut my mother was always very accepting and while i did have firm boundaries as a little kid, as a teen there was almost nothing to rebel against because she trusted me to behave responsibly so she let me go out, have parties, stay over with friends, dye my hair blue, paint my bedroom blood red, etc. I think a controlling parent would be more likely to punish their kid if they read something that they didn't like.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, my mother still thinks i don't know that she was reading my journal and i don't plan on telling her because i know she was terrified about my moving away to university when i was so unwell, and it probably gave her a lot of comfort to read about his things were 'really' going. I think she was wrong to invade my privacy, but i understand why she did it. We're really close these days. She's the best parent i could have wished for \n\nAnyway, my point was that if you let your niece know her parents are reading her diary, she can adjust what she writes. Either use it to talk to them like i did, or just be aware that what she's writing isn't private.\n\nIf you don't want to outright tell her, how about a story about a 'friend' of yours who kept two diaries as a kid; one for their parents to find, and one super-hidden real one.

Giving your niece a tablet wouldn't seem out of the ordinary. Put a sim card in it on your own phone account then password protect it. I had to buy my mom a phone because my dad wouldn't.

Password protect her browser and make sure she knows she has to sign out of the browser when she's done. If she isn't experienced with social media, you might need to discuss online safety with her.\n\nIf she has her own computer, you could set up an account for her in an alternate browser like Firefox then have her download it to her computer without putting a direct link on the desktop.

That violation of trust and privacy stays with you. I do not have the best relationship with my mom", "Niece is going to figure it out sooner or later.

There is so many personal thoughts put into a diary. The line they're crossing could potentially be gross and definitely embarrassing.\n\nGet her the diary with the lock.

I don't think my husband would ever read them, but I simply can't trust that my innermost thoughts will remain private. \n\nThe best you can do is give the niece a subtle heads up that they are prying or get her a digital form with a passcode only she would know. \n\nIt actually infuriates me that so many parents feel entitled to their child's every thought and action and that privacy should never be given to them.

It would've been one thing if she was a troubled kid who often got into dangerous situations and the parents kept a tab on her diary to make sure she's staying safe, but that's not the case here. According to OP the kid has good grades and rarely gets into trouble. \n\nSo these fkn parents are not just unjustifiably reading her diary without her consent, they're also sharing her inner most private thoughts with family members like they're gossiping teenagers.

NTA at all though, I remember 14 and while the thoughts I had and things I wrote in my journal were totally normal I would have been mortified if my mum read them.
