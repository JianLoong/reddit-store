But having now seen it from the POV of a parent too, I think that at some point (And under normal circumstances), you have to let go and trust that you're teaching your kids right.

It came from a place of concern about me (which was very well justified) and tbh at the time i was too depressed to really care once i figured it out. \n\nBut i did start modifying what i wrote bearing in mind that she'd see it. Not lying, but more like talking about things that were too difficult or awkward to bring up in person. And it actually helped our relationship a lot, i think. For example, if there was a difficult moment at home, i could write my side and my feelings without being interrupted or even having to be that tactful (it was, after all, just me talking to myself, right?). I wrote about my sexuality and the people (male and female) that i was interested in, or starting to date. So when i 'came out' and brought a girl home for the first time, my parents were already primed for it.\n\nBut my mother was always very accepting and while i did have firm boundaries as a little kid, as a teen there was almost nothing to rebel against because she trusted me to behave responsibly so she let me go out, have parties, stay over with friends, dye my hair blue, paint my bedroom blood red, etc. I think a controlling parent would be more likely to punish their kid if they read something that they didn't like.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, my mother still thinks i don't know that she was reading my journal and i don't plan on telling her because i know she was terrified about my moving away to university when i was so unwell, and it probably gave her a lot of comfort to read about his things were 'really' going. I think she was wrong to invade my privacy, but i understand why she did it. We're really close these days. She's the best parent i could have wished for \n\nAnyway, my point was that if you let your niece know her parents are reading her diary, she can adjust what she writes. Either use it to talk to them like i did, or just be aware that what she's writing isn't private.\n\nIf you don't want to outright tell her, how about a story about a 'friend' of yours who kept two diaries as a kid; one for their parents to find, and one super-hidden real one.

Teenagers are weird and can keep the strangest things secret but they are entitled to them. My sons are in their 20s and we have a great relationship and, when possible, we enjoy each others company. I like to think some of that is how open I was with them as well as understanding that, even as teens, they were entitled to some privacy. \nDiaries aren't always a record of what you've done, they may be hopes, dreams and made up/wishful thinking. Your brother and wife are the AHs - if their daughter ever found out, what do they think will happen? However much I may have wanted to(!), you can't control your children, so you have to create an atmosphere where they feel safe expressing themselves and part of that is trusting them.\nA digital diary seems like the best suggestion - perhaps a gift to her could be a subscription to one, if there is such a thing. You're not exposing her parents as the AHs and creating friction but also giving a gift of something you know she enjoys?", "So, personally I would try to get her to connect the pieces by sharing your own story.

I would not have taken the news well from a third party. I would not have seen attempts to get me to switch my journal online positively either. Online journals have the risk of getting broadcast to a much wider audience. I\u2019d wonder if my uncle was a creep who wanted to read my journal, and if he told me my parents were reading my journal I wouldn\u2019t trust him either.
