She has loads of books and trinkets, so I think it will be easy to disguise. I am going to put a new diary and a nice pen inside, along with a note that tells her this box is HER SECRET and it's for anything she wants to keep private. I truly believe she will get the hint.\n\nI've decided not to tell her outright, but if she asks me why I got her this gift I will tell her a story about \"a friend\" whose diary was read. I'll give it to her the next time I pick her up from school so she can just put it in her bag with her other books.\n\nThis may be overkill, but I've also ordered a book on how to make your own secret code/cypher, and the next time I spend time with her I'm going to suggest we come up with a code as a fun activity and see if she'll be interested.\n\nI plan to approach my brother and SIL and explain to them exactly why I think what they did was wrong, and I may show them this post, as some of you had very good responses that were better than what I could come up with.\n\nCheers!\n\nTl;Dr: Ordered a lockbox and a new diary for Emily, I'll handle her parents on my own.", "created_utc": 1681114969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hbxju/wibta_if_i_25m_gave_my_niece_14f_a_private/", "score": 2193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It came from a place of concern about me (which was very well justified) and tbh at the time i was too depressed to really care once i figured it out. \n\nBut i did start modifying what i wrote bearing in mind that she'd see it. Not lying, but more like talking about things that were too difficult or awkward to bring up in person. And it actually helped our relationship a lot, i think. For example, if there was a difficult moment at home, i could write my side and my feelings without being interrupted or even having to be that tactful (it was, after all, just me talking to myself, right?). I wrote about my sexuality and the people (male and female) that i was interested in, or starting to date. So when i 'came out' and brought a girl home for the first time, my parents were already primed for it.\n\nBut my mother was always very accepting and while i did have firm boundaries as a little kid, as a teen there was almost nothing to rebel against because she trusted me to behave responsibly so she let me go out, have parties, stay over with friends, dye my hair blue, paint my bedroom blood red, etc. I think a controlling parent would be more likely to punish their kid if they read something that they didn't like.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, my mother still thinks i don't know that she was reading my journal and i don't plan on telling her because i know she was terrified about my moving away to university when i was so unwell, and it probably gave her a lot of comfort to read about his things were 'really' going. I think she was wrong to invade my privacy, but i understand why she did it. We're really close these days. She's the best parent i could have wished for \n\nAnyway, my point was that if you let your niece know her parents are reading her diary, she can adjust what she writes. Either use it to talk to them like i did, or just be aware that what she's writing isn't private.\n\nIf you don't want to outright tell her, how about a story about a 'friend' of yours who kept two diaries as a kid; one for their parents to find, and one super-hidden real one.

Thanks for looking out for your niece.  ...and shame on your brother for perpetuating the shady \"parenting\" tactics that your parents used on you guys!", "Nta. My mom used to read my diary. No matter where I hid it, she'd find it. Then tell me to change certain parts and what I could and couldn't put in it. I became furious and refused. I found a waterproof bag then climbed a tree that I knew wouldn't be able to hold either parent's weight and put it into a hole. That's where I would write in my diary. My mom would nag at me to bring it down and I became stubborn and refused. When the tree started to bend under my weight, I changed the location to another tree but at the bottom and hidden between the roots. She never found that one either oh and in my previous hidding spots were pieces of paper that had one word or one sentence. Loser. Ha!!Got you again. Nope not here either. Cold.\nThat drove my mom crazy.", "NTA\n\nBut it's 2023, teach her to keep a password encrypted digital journal and let her boost her typing skills at the same time.

Giving your niece a tablet wouldn't seem out of the ordinary. Put a sim card in it on your own phone account then password protect it. I had to buy my mom a phone because my dad wouldn't. He had been trying to isolate her from us kids (adults). Set your niece up with a private cloud journal. Password protect her browser and make sure she knows she has to sign out of the browser when she's done. If she isn't experienced with social media, you might need to discuss online safety with her.\n\nIf she has her own computer, you could set up an account for her in an alternate browser like Firefox then have her download it to her computer without putting a direct link on the desktop. As long as she signs out of her cloud journal and the browser account, she should be fine.", "NTA, but I would tell her.  That\u2019s just what I would do, not necessarily suggesting you should.  I just think that if someone\u2019s privacy is being violated they should be told, no matter how old they are.  What her parents are doing is wrong by every measure.  That poor kid.  If she knew, she could at least try to hide it.", "NTA. You need to tell her. My mom did this and I never wrote my feelings down again. I won\u2019t tell anyone my deepest thoughts because I know look at it like evidence to be used against you.", "Nta\n\nTell her because she deserves to know. If this blows up her trust with her parents, that's on them for not trusting her in the first place.", "That's really awful of them. She should really keep it on a computer or her phone, where she can protect it with a password. \n\nWhen I was a kid/teenager I always kept a diary and my mom read it all the time (it didn't matter where I hid it, she would search for it, I had absolutely zero personal space in my own room) and to this day, I am paranoid of having my journals read even though my husband would never do that. That violation of trust and privacy stays with you. I do not have the best relationship with my mom", "Niece is going to figure it out sooner or later. It's going to be some very personal issue that she thinks is just between her diary and herself. She is going to freak out on her parents for invading her privacy.  You could wait until that point and feign ignorance. Remember that your brother warned you off from being involved. \n\nTell your brother and his wife that they're both making sure that their daughter is never going to tell them anything personal ever again. Ever. \n\nThey are indeed violating her privacy at a time that her own autonomy is just being developed. So, she's either going to bring up her walls or just stay with them forever.

You don't have to offer any explanation to her or her parents for the gift. It's just a gift!", "NTA you're looking out for her. What her parents are doing is invading her privacy, they will eventually let something slip that informs her that they've been reading her diary. Who knows how much they'll have read by then, her intimate feelings about a boy in her class, sexy dreams, first kiss, first time she masturbates, her friends private business.... There is so many personal thoughts put into a diary. The line they're crossing could potentially be gross and definitely embarrassing.\n\nGet her the diary with the lock. Maybe she could keep it in her locker at school or you could give her ideas on where to hide it. Hell she could keep her current diary in it's regular place and write fake stuff in it. Whether it's to keep them from looking for the new one or so she can use it to call them out for snooping.\n\nShe deserves to know. What they're doing is not okay. You're having her back and being a good aunt.\n\nI bet if the rest of the family found out what they were doing they would be disgusted too", "You would not be the bad guy. Coming from a place as a parent, I despise those parents that seek to invade and control their kids lives. My kids and I have always had a very open communication. They come to me with worries and problems all the time. OP, your brother sounds like a major control freak. Did you have issues with him growing up? I would be curious if he was always like this or if it is a recent thing since becoming a father.", "NTA- I would. She hasn\u2019t done anything to cause them feeling the need to snoop. It\u2019s an invasion of privacy.", "NTA, but a lock won't stop them. Most of those journalists locks are easily broken into or broken period. They may also just demand the information from her. I typically am on the side of parents deciding how to raise their children, but not when they are actively doing something that hurts then. If I were you, I'd give the nice a heads up so she knows not to write anymore or write fake entries.\n\nI am in my thirties. I found out when I was a teen that my mom and brother were reading my diary. They always just knew things that were private to me and when I denied them, they'd get angry. Eventually my mom fussed up and like your brother and SIL, she justified it by saying I was her kid and she had a right to know. \n\nNo, she didn't. Neither do your brother and SIL. Your diary/journal is supposed to be a way for you to process innermost thoughts free from judgment. It is essentially your brain on paper and it's a massive violation to read it. Even now, my therapist has told me multiple times how beneficial it would be for me to write my thoughts and problems into a journal and I can't do it because I have massive trust issues. I don't think my husband would ever read them, but I simply can't trust that my innermost thoughts will remain private. \n\nThe best you can do is give the niece a subtle heads up that they are prying or get her a digital form with a passcode only she would know. \n\nIt actually infuriates me that so many parents feel entitled to their child's every thought and action and that privacy should never be given to them. Children aren't possessions.", "You could not be the AH and I would go so far as to warn your niece her parents are reading her diary. Since they don\u2019t seem to care about privacy. They shouldn\u2019t mind you telling her (of course they will).  \n\nWhat a horrible thing to do to her. My mom said \u201cI will never read your diary because my parents did and it was awful.\u201d  My mom read my diary. I learned the hard way to never write things down. Which is also bad because writing is a good way to process emotions.\n\nI love my mom, but I keep her on a needs to know basis on almost everything because I do not trust her.", "Nta, but go about it better. A locked journal invites escalation from her parents.\n\n Encourage her to use her physical journal as a decoy, then have her set up a secondary gmail account. Offer to be her reset phone number or email if she trusts you not to snoop.\n\nShe can log in, do NOT have passwords auto fill on any device, and just use the free Google drive/docs to write her thoughts down. If she logs in primarily from the school computers, that would minimize the odds of her parents catching her in the act.", "NTA. You'd be doing the right thing. And without the kid knowing. You can give it to her while looking at your brother's eyes.

No one would suspect me\"", ">I assume they also want to know the moment she had her first time or worse be there\u2026\n\nYeah, sexually gatekeeping your teenaged children is basically incestuous.

It would've been one thing if she was a troubled kid who often got into dangerous situations and the parents kept a tab on her diary to make sure she's staying safe, but that's not the case here. According to OP the kid has good grades and rarely gets into trouble. \n\nSo these fkn parents are not just unjustifiably reading her diary without her consent, they're also sharing her inner most private thoughts with family members like they're gossiping teenagers.

We couldn't find anything right away bcuz it was a very small, very secluded town so we were forced to move back in with my parents for a few weeks. When I was a child I never kept a journal as it didn't seem important but after I moved out I started one to help me work out my issues that were caused by my childhood. After a couple weeks I found out that my mother had started breaking her way into my locked bedroom that I now shared with my friend to go through our stuff and read our journals. She had absolutely zero remorse or guilt about it and said she'd do it again without a second thought. I burned that journal and never wrote in one again. It has been about 20 years since that incident but I never forgot. About a month ago my 9 year old asked why I've never bought him a journal and if I have one. I told him why I don't have one anymore but told him that if he wanted one I would get one for him and promised not to ever touch it.  That's what parents should do.

The codes were alphabet shifting, like A=Z, B=A, C=B (shift 1); A=X, B=Y, C=Z (shift 3). Another idea is teaching her morse code through bracelet making. And another idea is to show her \u201cshorthand\u201d under the guise that it\u2019s the \u201cmost efficient way to take notes in class\u201d. It\u2019s no longer a \u201ccommonly\u201d used writing form; the only people I know who still use it on rare occasions are well over 50. I wouldn\u2019t even know what shorthand was if my mom didn\u2019t use it and tell me what it was.\nRegarding a lockbox that looks like a book\u2026 if you can get your hands on a big hardcover book you can turn it into a hidy book. Have it be a book that appears unassuming, like a dictionary. Say something like how it\u2019ll be so useful if the power goes out and niece needs to look up spelling for homework. It\u2019s a good backup option to have if the lockbox doesn\u2019t look enough like a book. \n\nOther ideas for safe journaling include:\n\n\u2022 books that look like regular books but have blank lines pages inside - unassuming as long as no one sees her using it\n\n\u2022 giving a hardcover journal placed inside the sleeve of another book - same as above \n\n\u2022 spiral notebook that is brought to school every day - unassuming and not suspicious if seen using it as long as there\u2019s an open textbook nearby\n\n\u2022 daily planner (my mom used these and shorthand - we have like 3 in our attic and asked her about it because confused about why she kept planners from the 70\u2019s/80\u2019s, when she said what they were we put them in a new safe place since we were cleaning out the trunk that they were in and told her where they were put) - also unassuming since lots of people use daily planners and it\u2019s not seen as suspicious to write in them.
