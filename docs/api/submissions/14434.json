I would maybe let it slip to the niece that daddy dearest is reading the diary. They would find a way to break the lock", "Sigh.  Kids like your niece can easily turn into the ones who sneak around, lie, and hide everything they do because their parents don't trust them.  My childhood best friend was one of them... he would lie to his folks when the truth would have served him better, just on principle.  He moved out on his 18th birthday and never looked back.  \n\nMaybe his experience colors my answer.  But having now seen it from the POV of a parent too, I think that at some point (And under normal circumstances), you have to let go and trust that you're teaching your kids right.  Kids need their privacy, and parents need to give it to them.  And I think YWNBTA if you helped your niece in that direction.  That's actually more than giving her a journal - it's letting her know you have her back, and there's no greater gift!", "NTA. Your brother and SIL seriously suck. Stand by your niece, she needs someone to advocate for her", "NTA. I think you actually need to tell your niece what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019re built these days but diaries with locks used to be pretty easy to get into when I was a kid.", "NTA I don\u2019t get why parents think children are entitled to no privacy until they are 18 or move out the house is so awful.", "Buy her a lockbox \"for precious things\", \"such as a diary\". More secure.", "NTA. Tell her what they are doing.

One day they're going to find out that Emily has been hiding something major and they're going to be shocked and upset that Emily didn't come to them. How is she supposed to do that if they're already demonstrating that they can't be trusted?", "NTA, and I really like your solution. I agree that straight up telling her is just going to cause fights. A sneaky gift might work better.  \n\n\nOne concern though: if you gift her a diary with a lock, her parents would still know your intentions, wouldn't they? Couldn't that still cause another fight between you and your brother?", "My mum read my diary as a kid. Destroyed my trust. An ex also read my diary years later. Never kept a diary again. \n\nNTA.

What next? Cameras in her room? A tracking app on her phone? A private detective following her?", "..m", "YWBTA 100%. \n\nIt's not an AH move on their part to **secretly** keep tabs on their kid, that's just good parenting. I'd do the same if I were a parent; teenagers are usually colossal idiots and it's a good idea to monitor their activities from afar, both online and offline. They would be AH's if they embarrassed her with their knowledge or started intervening into her life too much, but they don't seem to be doing that, right?\n\nYou have absolutely no business meddling in that situation, all the N.T.A's are just nonsensical IMO. If you actually want to be a good uncle, then encourage her to be more open with her parents (obviously without mentioning that they or you know anything about her diary).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I ended up keeping all my personal stuff over at my grandparents' house to put a stop to that. It didn't stop the snooping, following me to find out where I was going and seeing, so I learned to lie to her and be very good at it. I hope you'll continue to be there for your niece and support her as much as you can. She'll need someone she can rely on with parents like that.", "NTA: if you can afford it, I\u2019d suggest getting her an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, and buying her the Zinnia app. Zinnia is a journaling app which is passcode protected, and even if her parents somehow crack the passcode, she can hide her writing underneath stickers.", "Nta. They need to know that the second she finds out they've been doing this (and it will happen), she will lose all faith & trust in them both, something that could take forever to heal - if ever. Ask them if that's the relationship they want with her. They still have time to make changes to their attitude & behaviour.", "NTA her parents are complete trash, and you're right to call them out on it. Actions like this create very sneaky and deceptive kids, whether that's a good or bad thing depends entirely on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally I think you need to tell her what's happening so that she can better protect herself, then give her the new diary in secret, but encourage her to still write in the compromised diary as a decoy for her awful parents. \n\nShe doesn't even need to add detailed entries to the decoy, just something like \"today was fine, no complaints\" is enough, keep it simple and boring. If the parents confront her and ask why she isn't using her diary as much anymore, she can just tell them she's lost interest in it, and not tell them about the new one (if they want to encourage sneaky behaviour then your neice might as well put it to good use, I think protecting your right to privacy falls into that).", "Thank you. Our parents were like this, which is why I was shocked that they would do this. I became secretive myself and I guess he just repeated what he learned. That may be why my instinct is to give her a way to retake her privacy.", "As much as I want to tell her, I think telling her would cause her to panic and create a rift between them. It may cause a rift between my brother and me and I worry I won't be allowed over to the house. Then I wouldn't be able to help at all.", "Good idea, if I get her a lock box I'm sure she'll put the diary in there anyway.", "Right. I think I need to revisit the conversation with them but in the interim I'll get her a new diary with a lock.", "Right, I also feel really weird about pulling her aside and telling her to hide something from her folks. I feel like I'm in an odd position", "I'm sorry that happened to you.", "Oh, this might actually be the best solution. Because I can easily research a good website, share it with her and maybe she'll use it.", "Well, she does sort of have a tracking app. Life 360. I think it's mainly for tracking her location. That's reasonable to me.", "She is by all accounts a very good kid. She gets good grades, stays on top of her extracurriculars, rarely gets in trouble. They have no reason to search her private thoughts. Don't you think teenagers deserve some means of getting their private thoughts out without anyone prying into them? I think it's a parents responsibility to build the trust that makes the child comfortable talking to them. I appreciate your point of view, but a reading a diary seems a step too far when it comes to \"keeping tabs\".", "I've thought about this, but we don't see each other regularly enough. If she writes in it a lot, she may want it with her.", "Seems that kids either go exactly the way their folks went, or exactly the opposite.  Good for you for giving your niece her privacy - and other options to emulate!", "Getting her things with locks is going to unfortunately further the problem, if those parents see a lock they\u2019re gonna be convinced she has something to hide and they\u2019re gonna snoop and grill her more than they do. \n\nUnfortunately your niece is stuck in a tough position, and so are you - cause you\u2019re right, if you do tell her outright that her parents are snooping there\u2019s going to be consequences. \n\nEither way, there\u2019s going to be negative consequences for your niece with parents like that.", "You could use it and maybe say you are just fishing something when she's there. And casual mention that you only use this because people have read your diary before.", "\u201cI don\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t talk to us anymore\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already read her innermost thoughts without her consent and put an app on her phone to track her every movements. The only thing she could actually tell you about is her feelings and we already know you don\u2019t care about that, because if you did, you wouldn\u2019t do any of the aforementioned shit in the first place and would focus on developing a mature and trusting relationship with your daughter\u201d\n\nEdit: spelling", "That's all well and good, but if you insert yourself into that situation in the way that you intend to, that's still a guaranteed clusterfuck. How on earth can anyone think you wouldn't be an AH if blew up any kind of trust that kid has in their parents? \n\nDon't try to parent other people's kids, unless they're being negligent - and they are apparently being anything but that.", "Ahhhh I understand\u2026. Just keep being there for your niece", "Yeah. That's a very good point. Someone else said I could suggest an online journal instead. I think that's starting to look like a good option.", "As someone who keeps an online journaling app, that may be the way to go, plus it can be downloaded on a phone and she can take it anywhere and write whenever. \n\nI do advise telling her to log out every time she uses it though, and hiding the app in a folder that has settings, time, calculator, notes app, whatever other boring stuff - nobody is gonna think to check that folder."]}
