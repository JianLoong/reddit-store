I'm honestly surprised he didn't know after the cops were called on the guy. Overall though, no, you did the right thing, as you should be able to use the front stairs just as much as anyone else.", "Nta. Open front door is a security risk to everyone in the building. Also, neighbor letting his dogs out of the apartment into hallways also a injury risk to both dogs and people. You did the right thing.", "NTA. He\u2019s not just being a bad neighbor, he\u2019s breaking the law. Dogs must be leashed when outside because everything outside of his apartment is common area. Your friends are wrong. You shouldn\u2019t have to take the back exit.", "If this is enough of a problem that the cops have been called about it without your intervention, you're NTA. It's also unfair to his pets, who shouldn't be running loose around the neighborhood, or to your neighbors who have to negotiate around his unleashed dogs.", "NTA.  Your personal safety was at risk because the building front door was left open.  Apartment living means that everyone tries to avoid disrupting other's tranquility.  Any breach of safety should be reported to the landlord or other responsible organization ... fire department, police department, etc.", "NTA - I totally thought this would go differently, BUT your neighbor leaving the front door open is a safety concern for you all, along with his out of control dogs.  Someone needed to call the landlords attention to this.", "NTA. With doors wide open his dogs can come and go as they want to, and you said they bark and growl when people are too close, wich means they could bite, so it's dangerous for everyone. And since you have to use the back exit to leave the building, it's a problem too.\n\nYour neighbor is a lazy asshole. I mean, the cops came and told him to do something - and he did nothing? Then have the nerves to yell at you? The audacity of this dude lol.\n\nHonestly if he continues to stomp and slam the door every time you're around, call the landlord again for harrasment and explain what's happening. He's acting like a brat and I'm pretty sure you're not the only person he's annoying right now.", "NTA, your neighbor is doing so many wrong things you were right to inform the landlord.", "You have what is known as an AH neighbor. Also sadly there is no known cure other than relocation. They are a true plague and nuisance. Good luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I live in a large city, in a 3 floor walk up. I live in the middle floor. My downstairs neighbor regularly leaves both his door and other times the front door wide open. Strange, you may think - but he has a cat and two dogs who are also escaping into the landing area. I don\u2019t know if the dogs are aggressive per say, but they bark and growl if someone gets near. I also have two dogs and have to take the back fire exit to leave the apartment without possibly getting into a dog fight or something in the small entryway area when they are escaped. \n\nThe first time I came home and his door was wide open, I obviously thought something had happened. I did the cop knock and loudly yelling HELLO?? ARE YOU OKAY??? He came to the door and wasn\u2019t friendly about it and basically slammed the door. Now when I see him, he doesn\u2019t acknowledge me at all. \n\nHis dogs have also broken his actual apartment door, and I guess he never mentioned it to the landlord as it\u2019s just taped up. So in addition to them exiting his apartment when the door is open, sometimes they break though the taped up door. Over the last year this has happened probably 15 times. \n\nLast week, the dogs must have escaped or something fully outside because a bunch of people were in the landing and the cops came at like 4 am. I was asleep but caught it on security camera. I also caught the cop loudly saying they need to secure their door. I thought ah okay surely this will be the end, but the next day I leave my apartment and DUDES DOOR IS STILL OPEN? \n\nI finally just texted our landlord and basically said can you please look at neighbors door, it\u2019s broken and always standing open and his dogs are always escaping and finally escaped outside. I\u2019m not sure what happened after, but the next day the door was \u201cfixed\u201d and the neighbor came out as I was walking by to literally yell at me about tattling to the landlord. He went on and on. I finally yelled it\u2019s the landlord property and he needs to fix his door! (I didn\u2019t know what to say and I\u2019m awkward and it was 6am lol). Now its really awkward and I hear dude stomping at all hours. Whenever I go by he opens then slams the door. \n\nI asked my friends and they agreed its weird but said I should have just stayed out of it. That I have a separate exit out the back I can just use. Was I out of line?\n\n*As an aside, I\u2019ve NEVER once seen dude outside with his dogs. I have two elderly dogs and work from home, so I take mine out a million times a day. Legit never once have I seen them outside in over a year. We have no yard, and I don\u2019t smell anything so where at they going to the bathroom?!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s your property that might get stolen or you might be harmed or killed as a result of this nonsense.  He doesn\u2019t care about your safety or ease of use of the apartment so you shouldn\u2019t give a rip how he feels about your complaint.  \n\nI\u2019d complain every day he leaves a door open from this day forward.  Document the issue.  Complain in email and by phone. Take photos", "NTA alone for the security risk of the ah leaving the front door open ,and that is ignoring the dogs who could bite someone.
