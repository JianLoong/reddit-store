The family knows that they have a lower boarding priority (and in OP's case, can only fly free in the main cabin).  The family knows this and accepts it.  There are even cases where there aren't enough seats on the plane, and the family has to make a choice whether to split (go on separate flights) or everyone waits for the next flight.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying that I really doubt that an employee would or should feel guilty for flying in front of the curtain while a parent flies in the main cabin.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
