I took it as a threat. Later when I became pregnant with my second child she demanded I hand him over to her as she wants a chance to experience motherhood.

When I refused, we started getting bi-monthly CPS calls claiming we were unfit parents.

My kids father and I haven\u2019t been together in a while, though we do co-parent, and agree to keep our distance still from his sister Beth.\nJoe (my ex) told me his parents want our children at an upcoming family reunion, I was hesitant as I asked is Beth going to be there? He answered probably with great dislike. This is where I might be the AH, I called Joes parents and told them I don\u2019t trust Beth, they know why as we had this discussion before, but they say they don\u2019t believe their daughter would do that. It\u2019s not my place to change their minds but I am the mother to my children. I told them as long as Beth and her husband wasn\u2019t going to be there or if Joe was going, which he wasn\u2019t , I would allow them to go, but is she\u2019s going they aren\u2019t. They think I am holding onto the past and it should be a time for reconciliation.

You've given them a good reason not to pass it on. I hope they continue to keep that promise. I can't wrap my head around them seriously thinking your kids would be safe with her around.
