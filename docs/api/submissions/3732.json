My cousin t (40\u2019s) is the child of an affair that happened some decades back when my aunt stepped out on her husband. Her husband, my uncle still vowed to raise her as his child and gave her his last name as well as legally signing the birth certificate. Yet, despite all the decades she has consistently been sidelined by the family. Her own sister is invited to events but she isn\u2019t. I\u2019m talking like Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter. I got fed up with this and I began inviting her to events our family hosts. We will do our own little Thanksgiving, Christmas, or other meet up events. \n\nRecently I have family coming to town and wanting to celebrate Christmas this year. I was invited to go and I brought up how I wanted to invite cousin t along. This got lukewarm remarks and I kept pressing why isn\u2019t she invited? She is a member of this family. My great cousin and aunt then remarked that cousin t father isn\u2019t really hers and she is some other man\u2019s child. I countered that in the law of the land and god rest his soul, my dead uncle that she is his legal daughter. My first cousins even mentioned how I should let it go and she isn\u2019t really a member of the family. I told them that if they don\u2019t acknowledge her as well then we will have a problem. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I am expecting her to come unless she wants to, but I really feel hurt for her that she isn\u2019t even invited. When I invited her to the family events we hosted, she was always happy to come and be invited. She is my first cousin after all. I know my cousins or extended relatives didn\u2019t like that she was there but I put my foot down that she is MY family.\n\nMy sister thinks I should just let this go and just go since they\u2019re old in their ways. I don\u2019t want to go anymore frankly since I don\u2019t get how they can be so cruel to not recognize her for something she had nothing to do with. If they had a problem with it then why did they never bring it up with my uncle?", "created_utc": 1669931225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za0xxc/aita_for_consistently_including_an_unwanted/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thank you. I can't imagine how bad it must hurt to feel so unwanted and unwelcome by my own family. Thank you for having your cousin's back. This was so sad to read but the holidays are about family and family isn't limitted to blood. \n\nIf your family feels uncomfortable, they'll survive. I guarantee your cousin has been feeling far more uncomfortable for far longer. I can honestly say that I would draw the line where you did and make a stand against this \"old in their ways\" hatred and I'm glad that you did too.

I've known really old people that are very kind and accepting, and some young ones that are nasty.  Age isn't an excuse for bad behavior.  **Your sister is enabling the people that are toxic.**\n\n**I think your instincts and compassion are lovely.**  Start your own events, if they can't be kind.  \n\nIt's likely that they are doing this now, because they knew that uncle wouldn't let them get away with it, before.  And they have always been this cruel, just hid it better before.  Your sister is enabling this behavior, so it seems the toxic relatives know that they can manipulate her into doing nothing and letting them behave this way.  \n\nI think it very likely that you will be forced to \"have a problem\" with them, eventually.", "NTA and may I just say that those family members who have discarded this cousin like this totally suck?

When you host you invite your cousin and make her feel welcome, no one ask you not to invite your cousin because they don't feel the same way you do.\n\nYou can't dictate who they should invite to their home, even if they invited this person would they feel comfortable attending? I don't think so, if you don't want to go then don't, but don't force your views on others that's not fair. They may be wrong to treat her the way they do, because she had nothing to do with her DNA, but at least you don't hold it against her, leave the others to deal with their Hangups and you continue to welcome your cousin to your home.", "Did they shun the cheating aunt too, or just the blameless child who was the product of the affair?\n\nPeople suck, but you don't.

There is a lot of talk about her over that because the family thinks it was wrong to raise her as his child when she was someone else\u2019s.
