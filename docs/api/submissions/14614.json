So I got up and made a coffee and got ready to go outside for a smoke. \nAs I'm getting my lighter my roommates friend says he's not comfortable with smoking. I laugh and said it's fine I'm going outside anyway. He says \"No. I'm not comfortable with you smoking while I'm here.\" Which took me aback. I said that's unfortunate but I live here so I'm going out for a smoke. My roommate chimed in with a \"you can go without for a few hours, it's fine,\" which really pissed me off since they were over for 6 hours. I didn't say anything and just went back to my room. After his friends left I went out to talk to him and said that \"I'm not okay with you bringing people over who feel entitled to police my behavior,\" which started an argument between us. \nMy side is that I live here and I shouldn't have to change all of my behavior/habits to make his friends comfortable. \nHis side is that he also lives here and should be able to have his friends over, and that I should be willing to adapt for a few hours to make them comfortable. \nI'm standing firm and told him that next time they're over for that long I will be going out for a smoke and if they're not okay with that they can hang out somewhere else. \n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1681314544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jqbzm/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_his_friends_cant/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No judgement because you are an adult presumably.  \n\nIts precisely none of their business and not their problem. \n\nIn fact, despite the supportive tone, I'm quite uncomfortable with all the comments on here telling you that you should stop.

I'm sure there are subreddits and healthcare providers which can offer better advice and supports when/if u/Ok_Monk7250 wants to quit.   \n\n\nThe subject of the post is the asshole judgement. OP, you are NTA. The effects of smoking, the challenges of quitting, etc are all irrelevant. You've already done a great job handling the situation. Nothing about your behavior was inappropriate. It was highly inappropriate for the friend to try and control your behavior when you are abiding by the lease and house rules (many leases prohibit indoor smoking, and some apartment/condo complexes require it only happens in specific outdoor spaces on the property).   \n\n\nI imagine your roommate felt caught in the middle, and out of a desire to please people sided with their friend. I understand that feeling, but in the end it's not okay for them to ask you to do/not do something with your body when it doesn't affect others (you're doing it outside, you aren't doing it right next to a non-smoker or a car, you presumably aren't doing it right by the door where it will come inside).   \n\n\nSince you live with this person, I suggest trying to avoid conflict as much as possible to make sure you have a comfortable living space and roommate relationship. You're really not ethically obligated to modify your behavior any more than you have, but *you* may benefit from any of the following things, as they may help you avoid such nonsense in the future. Totally up to you though!  \n\\- Put the lighter and cigs in a pocket so it's not obvious what you're going out to do when friends are over  \n\\- Get yourself some exercise and dopamine by going on a walk around the block as you smoke so roommates buddies can't even see it  \n\\- If you have a body spray or a cologne, perhaps give yourself a spritz when coming back in so friends are less likely to notice and make dumbass remarks about it  \n\\- If possible, exit through a door where the friends won't notice you coming and going  \n\\- Drive to the corner store for a soda or an iced tea, and smoke in the car on the way  \n\\- Use a vape to consume nicotine in these moments so that you don't come back in with a smell they can detect  \n*Again, you are* ***not*** *obligated to do these things.

If the friends don't want to come over because OP is a smoker and goes outside to smoke sometimes, that's on them, not on OP. \n\n>They both entitled to the apt\n\nExactly, and while OP hasn't tried to impinge on roommates access to the apt, roommate *has* tried to dictate what OP can do *even while he's not in the apartment!!!!* OP is entitled to leave his apartment to smoke.

It's on roommate and his friends to resolve. OP is not obligated to make roommates friend more comfortable. If friend is uncomfortable with OP living his life in his own home, that friend can get out. Roommate doesn't get to dictate what OP does *outside of the apartment* just so he can have friends over.

That's totally unreasonable and uncalled for. The roommate is an AH for trying to get OP to change his behavior after they signed a lease. The fact that they shouldn't be roommates still doesn't fall on OP, because the roommate is the one trying to change their living agreement after the fact. OP is free of blame here.", "Okay.
