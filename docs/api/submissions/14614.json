So I got up and made a coffee and got ready to go outside for a smoke. \nAs I'm getting my lighter my roommates friend says he's not comfortable with smoking.

My roommate chimed in with a \"you can go without for a few hours, it's fine,\" which really pissed me off since they were over for 6 hours. I didn't say anything and just went back to my room. After his friends left I went out to talk to him and said that \"I'm not okay with you bringing people over who feel entitled to police my behavior,\" which started an argument between us. \nMy side is that I live here and I shouldn't have to change all of my behavior/habits to make his friends comfortable. \nHis side is that he also lives here and should be able to have his friends over, and that I should be willing to adapt for a few hours to make them comfortable. \nI'm standing firm and told him that next time they're over for that long I will be going out for a smoke and if they're not okay with that they can hang out somewhere else. \n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1681314544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jqbzm/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_his_friends_cant/", "score": 3902, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would go out the day before and rake the main area and set up my tent and shit. Make sure the fire pit was in good condition, gather up a big supply of fire wood. Usually over the weekend somewhere between 15 to 20 people would show up a few years we had between 30 and 40 people at different points over the weekend. One year a friend brought his new girlfriend with. Not everyone in our group smokes pot, but of the core 20 people from highschool friend group 15 have smoked pot, about 4 casually and 8 at least a couple joints a week, 3 rarely anymore. We head off about 15 or 20 ft from campfire and she asks where we are going and i pull out a pack of joints and offer her to join us if she wants; i know her bf wont his new job piss tests. Suddenly she starts freaking out at us trying to tell us we cant smoke pot its illegal and amoral and against the bible. Freaks out at her boyfriend to try to stop us, then comes over and tries to take my pack of beautifully rolled joints i assume to try to get rid of them. I am a very big dude so i just held them above her head while she shrieked at me not really knowing wtf im supposed to do to what i can only picture in my head as a tiny barking chihuahua(had taken a good edible late afternoon :) ). Eventually she lets out one loud shriek and demands that her boyfriend take her home. Which he cant. We have all been drinking, his truck is also blocked in. Also very spotty cell service, you can make a call over by the lake but it a 10 min walk through the forest in the day and it is very dark out. She demands he finds her cell service and a ride home. They disapear for almost 2 hours till we go searching for them, they had not been able to find anyone willing to come pick her up. She stayed in his camper the rest of the night.

Anyway, like I said before you want high THCA percentages in weed, not specifically thc. Look up any weed and read the thc percentages. Thc is incredibly low because with heat it burns the molecule and wastes it. With thca when heat is applied it burns the acidic proponent off, which protects the thc molecule that you want. This is why you can\u2019t just eat weed and get high with out cooking it first. Thca has no psychoactive effects, and is where most of the actual health benefits of weed actually live.
