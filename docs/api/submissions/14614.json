So I got up and made a coffee and got ready to go outside for a smoke. \nAs I'm getting my lighter my roommates friend says he's not comfortable with smoking. I laugh and said it's fine I'm going outside anyway. He says \"No. I'm not comfortable with you smoking while I'm here.\" Which took me aback. I said that's unfortunate but I live here so I'm going out for a smoke. My roommate chimed in with a \"you can go without for a few hours, it's fine,\" which really pissed me off since they were over for 6 hours. I didn't say anything and just went back to my room. After his friends left I went out to talk to him and said that \"I'm not okay with you bringing people over who feel entitled to police my behavior,\" which started an argument between us. \nMy side is that I live here and I shouldn't have to change all of my behavior/habits to make his friends comfortable. \nHis side is that he also lives here and should be able to have his friends over, and that I should be willing to adapt for a few hours to make them comfortable. \nI'm standing firm and told him that next time they're over for that long I will be going out for a smoke and if they're not okay with that they can hang out somewhere else. \n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1681314544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jqbzm/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_his_friends_cant/", "score": 796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would go out the day before and rake the main area and set up my tent and shit. Make sure the fire pit was in good condition, gather up a big supply of fire wood. Usually over the weekend somewhere between 15 to 20 people would show up a few years we had between 30 and 40 people at different points over the weekend. One year a friend brought his new girlfriend with. Not everyone in our group smokes pot, but of the core 20 people from highschool friend group 15 have smoked pot, about 4 casually and 8 at least a couple joints a week, 3 rarely anymore. We head off about 15 or 20 ft from campfire and she asks where we are going and i pull out a pack of joints and offer her to join us if she wants; i know her bf wont his new job piss tests. Suddenly she starts freaking out at us trying to tell us we cant smoke pot its illegal and amoral and against the bible. Freaks out at her boyfriend to try to stop us, then comes over and tries to take my pack of beautifully rolled joints i assume to try to get rid of them. I am a very big dude so i just held them above her head while she shrieked at me not really knowing wtf im supposed to do to what i can only picture in my head as a tiny barking chihuahua(had taken a good edible late afternoon :) ). Eventually she lets out one loud shriek and demands that her boyfriend take her home. Which he cant. We have all been drinking, his truck is also blocked in. Also very spotty cell service, you can make a call over by the lake but it a 10 min walk through the forest in the day and it is very dark out. She demands he finds her cell service and a ride home. They disapear for almost 2 hours till we go searching for them, they had not been able to find anyone willing to come pick her up. She stayed in his camper the rest of the night. Needless to say he was single by the next weekend.", "Yeah, completely NTA.  Tell your roommate that that friend makes you uncomfortable and you don't want him there anymore, because he should be willing to \"adapt for a few hours\".", "NTA. Is he paying rent? No? Then he needs to shut the fuck up and mind his own goddamn business.", "NTA- I smoke outside on my porch and never smoke inside, your roommate's guest was very out of line. The guest is free to leave if they don't like it.", "Not even remotely a question: NTA\n\nYou live there, you pay rent, you're not breaking the terms of your lease.  Smoke up.  I fucking hate ciggs and I'm angry on your behalf.  Your roommate is a dumbass and his friend sounds fresh out of high school DARE.\n\nDon't like smokers?  Don't live with one.", "If you quit cold Turkey like I did, chocolate milk helps with appetite and nausea (:", "You are NTA, and his friends are NTBOY (not the boss of you)", "NTA. Your roommate got a place with a smoker. If his friends have a problem with it he needs to go to their place.\n\nI'd have told them to leave", "Agreed. \n\nI'm not a smoker anymore. But rest assured if someone had the audacity to do what's described here, I'm finding / buying a God damn pack of cigarettes and lighter and chain smoking until I'm good and smelly, then coming inside and making it a point to be by their side until they left. And I'll make sure to keep the remaining cigs in case they ever set foot in my house again.", "Seriously OP was much more polite than I would've been. \n\n\"I'm not comfortable with you smoking at all while I'm here.\"\n\n\"Well, that sounds like a you problem.\" [lights cigarette]\n\n(and I say this as a nonsmoker who hates cigarette smoke with an absolute passion)", "this^ i\u2019d just be like \u201cu pay rent here?\u201d", "I know enough people who woulda just lit it up right there inside. Like 'fuck you, this is my place, not yours'", "I was kinda baffled too at the audacity of those friends, to go into someone's home and be a nuisance there and police the actual residents behavior and habits. If someone would do that to me in my own house, I would be like \"well if you don't like it that sucks then\" and went and have my cig  :-D quitting is obviously essential but i can perfectly understand OP, when you're in a hard place/situation temporarily at life then better resolve that first and then quit after you gained your peace of mind back, quitting is much much more likely to stick then.  Op NTA", ">I'm standing firm and told him that next time they're over for that long I will be going out for a smoke and if they're not okay with that they can hang out somewhere else.\n\nJudgement please", "I agree, for your health you should quit. Until you do, that 'friend' can start paying rent if the thinks he can lay down rules. If it bothers him that's a problem he needs to deal with not you. Next time they are loud when requested not to then they all need to leave.", "I honestly would have flat out smoked in his face.", "As a non-smoker who detests the smell of smoke, I would never think to tell someone they shouldn't smoke in an outdoor setting where the smoke isn't getting to me. If they're in their home, they can smoke wherever they damn please and if I don't like it (e.g. they're smoking indoors next to me) I will simply leave, not tell tell what they can and cannot do.", "It may have an impact. If my neighbours' guests smoke outside I can smell it in my house - particularly if the windows are open. And smoke clings to smokers as though it's developed separation anxiety. I can absolutely smell someone who has been smoking even if they weren't near me when they actually sang the ash anthem. \n\nBut that doesn't mean I go around telling people they shouldn't smoke on their own property to accommodate me. This guest can simply... Go home.\n\nNot my house, not my miasma.\n\n(It's possibly relevant that very very few people smoke where I live. I can go months without smelling cigarettes, so it's possibly more noticeable)", "In this case it was cigarettes and even if it was weed it's federally legal and has the same laws and restrictions as cigarettes", "I was thinking that if it were me I'd be lighting my smoke up right in that dudes face. The sheer audacity to think that you can tell someone what to do in their own home.", "Same. And I don't even smoke.", "I will say definitely NTA to start. \n\nSecondly more important im also a smoker I also haven't quit but one thing I've realized is there is always a reason to not quit. Whether it's family or work or whatever there's always problems. So if you really WANT to quit just do it. Best of luck either way.", "You should have lit it up right there in the living room while staring right at those clowns. You live there. Once they start paying your rent they can comment on your bad habits. You have the patience of a saint. I would have went buck ass wild if some entitled \"guest\" said that to me. And I don't even smoke.", "First off you are NTA. It's your choice to do what you want with your own body. You are already accommodating by going outside to smoke. \n\nSecond though, there will always be a reason to smoke and the dust will never settle. You are giving yourself permission to keep an unhealthy habit by blaming work. If anything try going to an ecig to ease the transition out of depending on a cigarette.", "\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with you smoking while I\u2019m here\u201d\u2026.I would have said then you should leave. I\u2019m a former smoker and now if someone smokes near me I move away\u2026I would never ask them to stop or move away from me", "Just real quick, I smoked a pack a  day for 20 years but was able to quit cold turkey 3 years ago when my wife was pregnant.  You are able to quit, you just have to want to.  You don't have to quit now if you don't want but if you choose to do so you have the strength in you.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyways, NTA.  You went outside to smoke which was fine.", "You don't need to justify your smoking to anyone. You are a grown up and can make your own choices. You are more restrained than I would have been, it's your house, you wanted a cig so you should have done just that. NTA", "Can you ask your doctor about medication to help you quit? I quit 2 years ago (almost to the day) with help of some pills I was prescribed. Can't remember what they were called, but it helped immensely. Only drawback was that if you don't take them with food they will make you super nauseous and probably vomit. You're supposed to take them for at least 3 months but I ended up only taking them for maybe 5 weeks, I got sick of being sick. Luckily that was all I needed to get over the worst of the cravings and withdrawals, after that I was able to manage on my own.", "NTA your roommate it. whether you smoke or don't and what your intentions are, no one has the right to police you in your home. a home is your castle and your roommate should learn that his friends have no claim to it. your roommates friends can voice their opinions but you dont hae to listen to it.", "It was an AH move for your roommate to have people over during your sleep hours.  What would he say if you brought people over after work and made noise while he was sleeping.", "NTA. I would have lit up in their faces and stared until they left. Quitting is tough I smoked for 15 years and quit at least a dozen times, smoke free for 18. Just realize it's a process and a mental and physical addiction that's also part of your routine.  Keep that kernel in your mind that you want to quit and eventually you'll get there. Have there been times since with life/ work that the thought popped in my head \" dam I want a cigarette right now\" absolutely but it passes. Just keep at it you'll get there.", "I quit years ago and never smoked inside, but if some shit kicker guest in my home lulled this I'd saddle up right next to them on the couch and puff away.      \n      \nYou don't tell someone what to do in their own home just because you don't like it.  If you don't like it, leave.      \nNTA", "I don't even smoke in my house, but I would make an exception if a guest tried to pull this kind of shit with me. I'm sorry, when you start paying all the bills here- including the property taxes- then you can tell me I'm not allowed to smoke in the house or on the property. Until then, fuck all the way off with that audacity of yours! If I was still living with roommates and this happened, I would've refrained because that's my roommates' space too (and was always against the lease.) But I absolutely would've still gone outside to smoke and told the friend, roommates, and anyone else who had a problem with it to eat my ass.", "\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yep, I'd be right there beside you :)", "You think church-goers don't smoke?", "Next time he comes over and has a problem stick like 20 cigs in your mouth, light them up and blow at his face.", "Cigarettes makes my vote NTA. Weed is still illegal in many states where could get arrested for smoking it", "Was just coming here to say this.", "Technically on a federal level in the states it's still illegal but in some states level is legal. Feds aren't coming for you over a blunt though lol.", "Ditto!", "For me the thing that finally did the trick was a nicotine inhaler. I had to get a prescription for it (this was 2003), but it helped to be able to still have the hand-to-mouth part of my habit. Because it looked like I was smoking a tampon, I had added incentive to stop using it as soon as I felt ready.", "But don't use altoids to quit the lozenges! Cavity central. Use something sugar-free.", "I feel for you but sometimes you simply cannot reason with stupid.", "I appreciate your input but I also know whats going to trigger me to smoke. I have tried quitting before. I don't want to try and quit when I know I'm setting myself up for failure.", "Oh they definitely do. I was just in a similar situation as OP and they were in an almost cult like church. If our apartment even smelled like weed they wouldn't enter", "Manz is clearly Canadian as he states that its FEDERALLY legal. \n\nAlso doesn't matter, there's literally no way he can be TA in this situation.", "Well at least you are true to your icon lol.", "Other countries also exist and OP or the above commenter could be there", "> I'm literally just stating a fact, not making a value judgement. Ignorance is not cute\n\nI think the point is, if the State made it legal, then essentially it's legal (regardless of Federal law). There is zero chance of getting in trouble for smoking a joint in Oregon at your home.    \n\nYou know what they meant...the whole \"technically\" thing is obnoxious. It adds nothing to the conversation.", "I used to work at a Rite-Aid, and every week a guy came in and bought patches. We'd talk a little, just friendly-like, and as he left one day I said \"good luck with those, by the way!\"  My grandmother had recently died of lung cancer and I was glad to see someone quitting.\n\nHe said \"With what? Oh. I've actually never smoked, I'm just addicted to these fucking things.\"", "I slept with the patch on one night. I had some of the most vivid and fucked up dreams of my life, woke up feeling like I hadn't slept at all. But, I didn't need a dip first thing! \nI didn't sleep with the patch after that first night, figured I'd work on the morning cravings and actually benefit from my sleep", "10/10", "Ever tried smoking while on the patch? It\u2019s like a whole new ball game.\n\nI quit smoking ten years ago and switched to vaping, but I\u2019m a fan of lozenges during the times when I can\u2019t vape.", "I hate the patch. I've been a regular smoker for half my life now, but when I bought a box after I got my wisdom teeth out so I could make it a few days without risking dry socket all it did was make me nauseous. I should have thought of cutting it smaller, I was a fucking mess that week.", "I get it, I had quit chewing in my early twenties. It's never easy, we all hope you try though.", "How tf am I being \"righteous\" about weed by stating a fact", "Did I miss the part where it is illegal for black people and not white people? Is it not progress to legalize a substance that the majority of people and science think is a manageable risk? Or maybe you don't realize that the federal government aren't out in legal states policing weed? Making weed legal in states(which is what the state law enforcement follow) is great for black people. Not because I think they use more than other groups, but because it is one less insignificant thing police can use an excuse to jam up black folks.", "But that's not \"100% legal\"?", "Nicely played.", "Maybe it's just super common in the south or something, but I'd say it's rarer to see a spit bottle that isn't an old water or gatorade bottle.\n\nOf course, I usually saw these around baseball fields and such. I saw a few people dipping in class at college, but it was far less common at my college at least. I'm sure the baseball lads were dipping it up though.", "I've got a friend who started self-medicating his ADHD with nicotine gum. Says it works about half as well as adderall", "There are certain topics touching on in any manner will get you down voted. You touched on one.", "Still feel like you're missing the point of the comment that started this thread. It was that the friend could be uncomfortable about something that is technically illegal. If it's legalized by the State, there is zero reason to be uncomfortable about getting in trouble.    \n\nI guess it's possible the friend in question has the same mentality that you do? Get stuck on a word or phrase and have to be the \"well...technically....\" guy?? That even if the State legalizes something they just won't view it as ok if the Feds don't? Weird as shit in my opinion.", "It's so weird because I am not presenting it being illegal as a positive thing or defending anyone from the post, I am just providing extra information in response to someone saying it was \"100% legal.\" One of the worst aspects of this sub is that even if you say \"I agree that OP is TA/NTA, but X in your post is incorrect,\" people will respond as if you're disagreeing. Mind boggling.", "It's really not that deep", "Yup. I got lectured in a post here not too long back and they talked about my stance on the OP, which was funny because I had literally not said a word about the OP I had taken issue with some incorrect information and presentation in their post."]}
