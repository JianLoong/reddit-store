He called me out to the living room at 7 am, so I went to put a shirt on so I wasn't naked.\n\nApparently I took too long because he started screaming for me to get out there. When I was out there, he screamed that he wasn't asking he was telling, and told me to pack a bag. He started screaming that I never did anything and I live in HIS house and was to do what he sajd when he said it. I started screaming back and defending myself and he told me to pack a bag and get the fuck out.\n\nSo I packed my shit while he kept screaming at me and I called my sister to come get me. Now he and mom are acting surprised I left. Everyone but my sister is begging me to go talk things out with him and apologize, but I'm tired of pacifying his behavior and I've tried talking to him before after he calmed down and all he does is flare back up and scream. I've even tried writing him a letter so he doesn't have a chance to interrupt me and yell but all he did was ignore everything and focus on the wording. \"What if someone else read this blah blah blah\".\n\nI've got a job lined up and actually feel up to do school now that I'm out of there but I'm sick of people begging me to make up with him.

I don't feel so guilty anymore.\n\nI want to clarify that my sister doesn't have room for me and doesn't have the money to feed an extra person, so I'm on my own. I left my hamster at her house so she would be warm but I go back to take care of her myself, but I don't want to burden my sister. I do have shelter, and I have enough money to feed me for a while while I try to find another job so I can get back up.", "NTA whatsoever. You sound like you actually have your ish together, and I am proud of you for leaving. Best of luck!", "INFO: is J your father or stepdad? Are they married? \n\nShort answer, NTA.\n\nLonger answer, you're 16 and need a place to live. If you're a runaway, your parents can report you missing and make you go home so make sure you got all the legal bases covered. Your parents are legally (in the US) obligated to cover your basic expenses like shelter, food, school, medical. \n\nI'm really sorry for this. You should not be living with someone who is abusive", "NTA. Bad parents don't deserve forgiveness. He's like my dad. We barely speak now and my life is great, unless I have to interact w him.\n\nAs an adult, you get to allow or not allow people in your life. Your dad has to earn the privilege of being part of your life moving forward. And if he wants to be a screaming tyrant, he can do so without you around.\n\nYou got this. Don't let your mom lure you home. She's as much to blame for enabling his behavior. It will take you years to realize that being screamed at all the time isn't normal. He's got issues. And he'll never address them.", "NTA. You're better off never going back.", "NTA Abusive, toxic assholes like J don't deserve your time or respect. Good for you for fucking off out of there. Don't look back.", "Hell no. NTA. Good on you getting out of there!", "Nta\u2026\u201dburn garbage\u201d???", "OOOOO OP, get OUT OF THERE! NTA!", "NTA good for you and glad your sister is supportive.", "Nah NTA. Stay the hell out of that house and do not go back. Your dad is a turd, get a job and your own place. Don't apologize either, he forced this and now he can deal with the fact you refuse to return.", "NTA\n\nYou got out. Take some time to sort out your feelings and make decisions after you've had time to process. Until then use the time for you and your own improvement. J sounds abusive and it's uncalled for.", "NTA. OP shouldnt have to apologize, seemingly again to keep the peace? OP is owed an apology and is doing the right thing in moving on and away from such constant stress and getting on with life\n\nIF anything, J needs to come and try to talk things out. J needs to show effort as well to heal, fix and grow this relationship, if at all possible", "NTA. I\u2019m confused, he kicked you out. You left and now others are telling you to apologize?  He kicked you out.  Anyone tells you to work it out with him remind them that he kicked you out. Once was enough. No one needs that drama and insecurity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't ever go back. Go full no contact. Heal from the abuse you've suffered and go live your best life. \n\nAnd it sounds also like everyone except for your sister is an asshole here.", "NTA.   Parental abuse is terrible.  I've been there,  good luck to you", "NTA. He is abusive and that is such a heavy burden for you to have carried all these years. Your mom, and apparently others, are enabling his poor behavior.\n\nThis is a crap situation, but you owe him nothing.\n\nI hope you have some level of support to get back on your feet. I'm rooting for you.", "Absolutely positively NTA. Do not go back either!! Hopefully you\u2019re sister will let you stay there even just til you can get on your feet! This is full on emotional and verbal abuse and your mom is enabling it!! I\u2019m sorry OP, but your absolutely doing what\u2019s best for you. Fuck them both! Go get your hamster and cut all contact!! Best wishes!!", "Nta run and never look back  BE FREE OP BE FREE", "NTA- Dont go back stay with your sister. If your mother sees this BS and does nothing she is equally to blame for you leaving.. Tell your family to mind their business they dont live in your house and dont know sht", "NTA full stop!", "Thanks, I definitely need it", "Also, I'm 19, so thankfully they can't force me to stay.

Plans for the short and long term?", "Yeah but you have to at least give us the relationships between the characters or we have no clue what is going on. \n\nWhat if J were your imaginary pet fish who only exists as a voice in your head?
