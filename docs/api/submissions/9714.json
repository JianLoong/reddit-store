You know what she says. We all know what she says, because we've heard these tragic stories far too many times before.\n\nClearly he resents having you there and the fact you were a package deal with your mom. The house is probably matrimonial property now, aka, not his house but *their* house. But god help anyone who reminded him of that. Mom certainly won't stand up to him - she's probably afraid for her safety as well.\n\nSorry that you are being forced out of what really should be your home, a safe place.\n\nAs for people begging you to make up with him... naw.\n\nHe needs to make amends with *you* but will never admit it. He's a mean hateful SOB. He thinks his abuse of you is actually \"*raising that boy right\"* \\- the same way his abusive father raised him. Really did wonders for him, didn't it? He thinks he's good for you. That he'll make a \"real man\" out of you. The same kind of \"real man\" he thinks he is himself.\n\nAnd mom needs to (one day) admit she chose to be with a person who is abusive to you. She'll probably never own that either though. There is always a reason why mom couldn't leave the man who was violent towards her kids. Sometimes it's a good reason, other times, not so much. The moms often just say they were scared, or that it was complicated or that people just wouldn't understand. They're right. We don't.\n\nBut you don't owe anyone in that house a damned thing.

You stood up for yourself when everyone else wanted you to be his punching bag. \n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about what you\u2019re facing, but other people do. If you\u2019re in the US, try to find local services. The library is free and they might know who can help. You have a lot of people here cheering for you, and people are giving good advice. You can do this \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "I'm glad you got out of that rotten environment.", "At this point I neither see that kind of miracle happening, nor am I sure it\u2019s possible even if all are willing. Too much abuse for much too long. The best to be hoped for would be uneasy d\u00e9tente. \n\nOP, you are absolutely NTA. Not by any definition. You might not realize it, but what you did took strength. \n\nYour best revenge is to not just survive, but thrive! You clearly have the strength and determination. You have a lot of resources to help you. \n\nFirst, get work, stable shelter, and food established. If you need to get your GED, do that. Don\u2019t settle for minimum wage jobs for anything more than short term\u2026.although some can develop into well paid positions. My nephew started at minimum wage with ACE Hardware, and he\u2019s now a store manager. The brother of a former SIL started out at minimum wage at WalMart years ago, and he\u2019s worked his way up to being in charge of a division. In both cases, they worked hard, were reliable, have people skills, and got the education they needed to get them promoted. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, but over years. It started with minimum wage. You can do whatever you\u2019re willing to work for. \n\nStay NC with your family, except your sister. For the time being, anyway.  The posters here have lots of good advice about resources. \n\nGood luck, and keep us posted!", ">\"What if someone else read this blah blah blah\".\n\nThen they\u2019d know the truth? \n\nYou\u2019re under no obligation to protect him from the consequences of his own actions or keep his behaviour a secret. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t want to look like a shitty person on paper, he should have been a better person.\n\nYou know what he\u2019s doing when he says that? Slipping up. Admitting that he knows what he is doing is wrong. Admitting that anyone who actually saw it or knew about it would acknowledge as abuse. Let that sink in. He never actually thought he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, he just thought he had you manipulated enough that you\u2019d never stand up for yourself or call him out. \n\nRemember that if you ever begin to feel guilty. Keep proving him wrong. He never felt guilty for his actions for a second.", "In some states (like mine, NY), if a parent kicks you out, they are still legally obligated to support you until you are 21 (not just 18 like many assume). You\u2019d have the file with a court, but the court could order your parents to pay you support. Definitely something to look into. Best of luck, you can do this.", "Is there another family member who can take you & your cat in for a while?", "Do you have any friends whose parents might take you in for a little while? It sounds like most of your family wouldn\u2019t be very helpful, could you and your sister get a bigger place together? Can you emancipate yourself in your state? If you can you may qualify for food stamps etc. Leaving was a big brave thing to do and it sounds like it was the right choice but please don\u2019t try to do all of this yourself. You\u2019re still a kid and just because your bio family has never been supported doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have people who love you. It\u2019s OK to ask for help.", "Is it on someone's property.", "Not that I'm aware of. I thunk this part isn't owned by anyone, or at least not anyone who would come out this far. If it turns out I am ill leave ofc I don't want to trespass"]}
