If the kid doesn\u2019t carry on that legacy then, if it is a lot of money, they can donate the money on the condition that a building, hall, a small town library be named after the family.  This way either then the name survives thru the kid or because of charity.   So many people tie money to a name.

I mean they figured dad would be around a lot longer and died at 28. It\u2019s just as possible that both die tomorrow in a car accident or a gas leak. I say change his last name now.

In most jurisdictions, people are generally free to chose their beneficiaries and are not required to name relatives if they are not dependents.
