For background, he is moving from a different state for a new job he got in my city. Since he's been living with me, I've paid for almost every single one of his necessities, such as food, water, clothes, phone bill, hair products, and any outings we have to the movies or restaurants I pay. The first three weeks, I paid for everything because he hadn't started his job yet. But he's been working for the last 7 weeks now, and he's getting a decent paycheck, but he doesn't seem to contribute to any of his own necessities. \n\nFor example, every time we go grocery shopping together, he says he doesn't want anything, but then eats all the groceries I bought within the next two days. Last week, he told me he was bored and wanted to do something, so I suggested watching the John Wick movie, and he agreed. When we bought the tickets and ordered the popcorn, I paid for my portion, and then he just stood there waiting for me to pay for his. I paid for his stuff because I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. \n\nAfter the movie ended, I told him that I'm going to grab something to eat and that he wanted to come along too. While we were there, he decided he also wanted to grab something. When we got to the cash, I paid for my portion, and he stood there awkwardly waiting. I told him kindly to pay for his things and then he told me he forgot his wallet at home. I'm not sure how to bring this up without causing any awkwardness or hurting his feelings?\n\nEdit: I sat him down and was direct about him needing to pay for his own necessities and that I can't cover the cost of his things. He got confused about why we would buy our separate things, because since we live in the same house and eat the same things, it should all be under one bill. He also said that he doesn't have an issue with someone paying on behalf of him because he \"remembers everything,\" and in the future, he will return all the favors. He turned it back on me that cousins are supposed to help each other out and not treat one another like strangers, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1688926881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v5mzr/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_he_needs_to_start/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
