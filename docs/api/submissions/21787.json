For background, he is moving from a different state for a new job he got in my city.

The first three weeks, I paid for everything because he hadn't started his job yet. But he's been working for the last 7 weeks now, and he's getting a decent paycheck, but he doesn't seem to contribute to any of his own necessities. \n\nFor example, every time we go grocery shopping together, he says he doesn't want anything, but then eats all the groceries I bought within the next two days. Last week, he told me he was bored and wanted to do something, so I suggested watching the John Wick movie, and he agreed. When we bought the tickets and ordered the popcorn, I paid for my portion, and then he just stood there waiting for me to pay for his. I paid for his stuff because I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. \n\nAfter the movie ended, I told him that I'm going to grab something to eat and that he wanted to come along too. While we were there, he decided he also wanted to grab something. When we got to the cash, I paid for my portion, and he stood there awkwardly waiting. I told him kindly to pay for his things and then he told me he forgot his wallet at home.

He's the one who should be shamed. \n\nTell him he's to start paying his share of the bills. Stop paying for his entertainment. I'd let him stand there all day while I went in and enjoyed my movie and snacks. Hes had at least 2 paychecks by now. He should have expressed his gratitude by automatically contributing. \n\nIf I was in your shoes I'd tell him he has until x date to move out. Then start the eviction process.

In fact, he's counting on it, that's how he's been able to freeload off of you so much and for so long.\n\nIf roles were reversed, he would never do the same for you so don't feel any guilt around this.

At this time you should mention the groceries. either tack that on to the rent or state clearly he needs to pay for his own.

It was very nice of your to let him move in while he looked for a job. But he has one now and needs to pay his fair share. Talk to him about this like an adult. \n\nIf he's saving up to get his own place, that's great. You're still paying for your place and bills. However, he needs to be paying for his own living necessities (including his phone bill).

You did him a huge favour paying presumably what would be minimum several hundred dollars in food, entertainment and even more in what would be rent/utilities. He's taking the piss at this point.\n\nIf he had some specific debts which needed paying more quickly and he'd been upfront and asked you to help for a bit and you'd agreed is one thing, just starting to get paid and continuing to leech off you just expecting you to pay?
