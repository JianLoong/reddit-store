The name Summer is my husband's favorite girl name (and my second favorite) and it was also my mom's favorite girl name, which my dad vetoed. Summer's middle name is my mom's first name. It's a very rare name in the US and can be difficult to spell and pronounce for people. So we felt it would be better in the middle name slot.\n\nThe name choice hurt my stepmom's feelings. To make the background simple. She became my stepmom when I was 6 a couple of years after my parents divorce. She struggled to find her place with me because I was extremely close to my mom and I knew she and my mom had bad blood. My mom died when I was 9 and I never turned to my stepmom and never grew closer to her or ended up considering her a real parent to me. She has always wanted to be closer but it never happened. I am pretty close to my dad, with some rough patches. So it has always been hard for her to love me as much as she does, while knowing I do not return those feelings and would be unlikely to stay in contact if she and my dad were to divorce or if he passed away.\n\nI knew when we were deciding on our daughter's name, that my stepmom would have a hard time with it. She's insecure because I have never gotten close to her and I am aware that she knows my husband and I have soft spots for honoring people in indirect ways, like using their favorite names vs their given name. She is aware that I might honor more family in the future and she will never be included in that. She's simply not important enough to me.\n\nApparently she had a reaction when she saw the name. My half sister (15) was pissed that I did that to her mom. She said I knew it would upset her. I told her that it should not be such a big deal. She said I knew it would be though. My stepmom found out what happened between half sister and myself and she reached out. She told me it was something she was working on dealing with. But could I consider the fact she's given me nothing but love since she met me and knows she can never be my mom, but to always be slapped in the face with she will never be as good as my mom hurts and to have both first and middle names be a nod to my mom feels like I am deliberately trying to put her in her place.\n\nMy half sister after this texted and said her mom cried and that she was trying to keep dad in the dark regarding her feelings and I was an asshole.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692200027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15st5at/aita_for_honoring_my_mom_in_my_daughters_name/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When my husband and I chose her name I was fully aware my stepmom would likely have her feelings hurt by the choice to do both first and middle names as an honor of sorts. I did so anyway. This might make me an asshole because I have always been the one to not return her love and have set the tone for the more distant relationship.

If she wants a relationship with your daughter she needs to back away and quit pushing for a type of relationship that you will never be willing to have with her.\n\nYour step sister needs to mind her own business. This has nothing to do with her. Honoring your mother had nothing to do with either of them. Your child\u2019s name is between you and your husband. No one else gets a vote or an option.\n\n\nDo not let them guilt or manipulate you. You did nothing wrong. There is nothing wrong or malicious about wanting your daughters name to honor your mother.", "NTA.

You didn't go out of your way to hurt your stepmom and she recognizes fully that this is *her* insecurity to deal with. \n\nI think if you wanted to have a heart to heart, then you could maybe say to your stepmom (depending on the role you've decided for her), that honouring your child with your mom's name is a way of keeping her connected to a grandparent who would love her but can't be here to watch her grow up. Stepmom gets to be actively involved as \"grandma\" or other title, and that is something you appreciate. \n\nYou could maybe even extend an olive branch of asking her to be the godmother, *if* you wanted to.\n\nBut you're NTA.

You're honoring your mom because you love your mom, not to spite your stepmom.

I think this is just yet another way your stepmom is centering herself in the situation. Once again it's not about dishonoring her it's about honoring your mom.

I doubt your half sister would ever consider naming one of her children after a possible future wife of your dad\u2019s. Explain it to her that way. Same with your step mom I strongly feel like the thought of her passing away and her daughter naming her kid after your dads new wife would crush her. It\u2019s wild how these super unfair expectations are only on the person who has lost the most. Your mom is dead hers isn\u2019t she gets to love her cuddle her and share milestones. Your daughter having a double meaningful names of your mom is really the only way you can have her in your everyday life. Asking you to share that tiny shred of your mom with your dads wife is unfathomably selfish", "NTA- so it\u2019s a slap in the face that you mourn your mother and want to honor her ?\n\nNo wonder you never warmed up to the woman and I can see why your mom had bad blood with her .\n\nIgnore all of them .\n\nCongratulations on your new bundle of joy.", "NTA.
