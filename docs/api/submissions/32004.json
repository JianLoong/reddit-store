The only things they throw away are the trash in the trash cans. Is your house extremely cluttered? Is it possible that \"trash\" and \"things with sentimental value\" are difficult to tell apart?

Does she do laundry and dishes?", "NTA.\n\nI wonder why she struggles to find work outside of the work you give her, that\u2019s so weird. \n\nOh right, BECAUSE SHE CANNOT FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS! \n\nYou need to let her go, and find a better cleaner. Wait till after Christmas if you like but that should be the go to.\n\nFrankly if it was an expensive gift I\u2019d be suspicious it wasn\u2019t in fact stolen not thrown away.  \n\nShe\u2019s either a thief or incompetent. Either way do you want her working for you?", "Umm how does she check with you before? Are you available so she can finish her job of cleaning or would it take hours for a reply?", "You're not wrong, but having a cleaning person you can trust can make you overlook a lot of  mistakes.

She charges I think 25 an hour but is thinking of going up in price. Some people around here make 50 an hour, no spit, and we are not in any sort of city.

You don't want to fire her, and she has made clear she isn't going to change. So... either you are willing to accept that things will be thrown away that you don't want thrown away because you prefer it to firing her, or you fire her. I guess validation is what most people are after in this sub, I just don't understand people that only want to mope about a situation rather than resolve it in some way. Lowering her bonus doesn't solve anything, it's really just a way for you to vent your frustration. I don't think it's unreasonable to lower/skip a bonus when her work performance is poor, but it should be recognized for what it is, which is venting. If venting is all you are after then have at it I guess, but the grown up thing to do is to look for real solutions to the issue at hand.", "NTA.

I agree with you. My cleaner does what yours does. I make sure before she comes that she does not have to work around piles of stuff or random things that get in her way. Ya\u2019ll are wild expecting a house cleaner to go through your clutter and messes. Pick up after yourselves!", "It's because this has happened multiple times. OP has already told the cleaner to check with them before throwing things away yet they keep doing it. \n\nGranted op should've put the package away before the cleaner came especially knowing they have a habbit of throwing things away and because it was expensive.", "\u201c having a cleaning person you can trust\u201d\u2026\n\nThey don\u2019t have someone they can trust, so what are you talking about?", "I work as an in home caregiver. A lot of that is cleaning and organizing for people that can't do it themselves. There's a lot of clutter, and usually things that don't manage to end up in a trash can. I ALWAYS ask if it's not obviously trash (dropped food and empty food containers/packaging that have been checked inside). Even if it's an empty box, just to verify. The only things that get immediately put in the bin is things that they've okayed me to do so without asking (dropped pills that arent xyz prescription, mail asking for donations, etc.) That's part of the job. She's there to make your life easier, not harder, even if she's just there to clean. I understand that you've built rapport with her and feel comfortable with her in your space, but you do need to have a serious conversation with her about this habit. \n\nChange in general, and change in a well worn in routine especially, can really suck on the spectrum. I get it, I really do, but either her behavior needs to change, or the person you employ does. If you tell her why the bonus is less, specifically about what she threw out that you had to replace, it might make it stick. It is definitely fair, especially as it's coming out of a bonus and not her base pay. I would just maybe give her a bit of heads up so she's not planning on it for holiday plans", ">She just did it by mistake\n\nOnce is a mistake. This isn't a mistake. She has shown disrespect to you and your household and will continue to do so because she knows you will feel guilty if you fire her. \n\nYTA to yourself for allowing this to continue to happen.", "I have this amazing bridge in New York for sale at a nice discount", "if it was a mistake you'd be able to get it out of the trash... this walked off. this has happened to many times...", "My entire house has hardwood floors, there are 3 bedrooms, an office 2.5 bathrooms, a galley kitchen. It's 3 floors and two people take 1 hour (sometimes 1.5 hrs) max to clean. I have no kids, no pets and am a caregiver to my two elderly parents. I cannot fathom what scenario takes 10 hours a week. I am definitely a very neat person so there is never any clutter but what is going on in the OP's house?", "They also do a better job when they can get to everything easily", "No there is a big difference between cleaning and tidying up.", "typically it\u2019s not the housekeeper\u2019s job to put things away and throw away trash for you, no. they do the vacuuming, dusting, sweeping, mopping, linens, etc. ideally you should tidy up before they arrive because it\u2019s not their responsibility to know where all your things go or to decide what\u2019s trash and what\u2019s not.", "Agree! I have explicitly told my cleaning woman that she is not to throw anything away without consulting me, even if it\u2019s food in the fridge that she thinks is spoiled, and not to move anything to a different place either. \n\nI had to let my previous cleaning woman go because she repeatedly put things away in places where we couldn\u2019t find them, including medications that we had on our bathroom counter or cupboards, despite being told multiple times not to rearrange our stuff. She didn\u2019t listen and therefore wasn\u2019t right for the job. \n\nOp needs to fire the cleaning woman and find someone who does was is asked.", "It would be like having a maid there every day just to do daily things so they won't build up", "my in-laws home is larger and their cleaners come every 2 weeks for about 1.5 hours... I don't understand 10 hours either", "Good question!", "Agree with this fully. When I know my cleaning lady is coming, I clear up clutter and put things away so she can clean properly. I can\u2019t imagine making someone try to clean around my empty boxes, etc. Based on a lot of the other comments it seems like maybe I\u2019m the abnormal one but to me it seems like common sense.", "Hoarding was the 1st thing that popped into my head as well. I've never heard of someone referring to a cleaning persons job as cleaning up clutter. A cleaning person cleans: sweeping, dusting, mopping, scrubbing. They don't put your stuff away for you. I'm sure they won't do as good of a job if they can't get to stuff to clean it.", "i guess it can be different depending on the circumstances/arrangement. i've never had a cleaning lady but a friend of mine did growing up and she did all of the cleaning and tidying i suppose you would say. like she'd do the sweeping/mopping/dusting ect but would also clean up the kids toys/organize any clutter left around", "I'm still confused. The house sounds like a WRECK. Lol."]}
