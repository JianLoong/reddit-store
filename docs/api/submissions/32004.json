We have a cleaning lady who works for us 10 hours per week. I need her as I can't handle the stress of cleaning myself  due to mental illness and having a cluttered house is terrible for my mental health too.\n\nShe has thrown out things in the past that she shouldn't have (I've rescued stuff that she was about to throw out like my artwork) and three months ago she threw out a bag of fabric that I was going to use to make myself clothing. She has done the same thing multiple times even though I've asked her to please check with me before throwing things away.\n\nI was willing to let it pass after a verbal warning in the past but it has become a pattern and I feel that I can't let it go again after she threw away an expensive present that my son bought for his best friend.\n\nThe reason why I feel like the AH is because she doesn't earn much and even though I pay her substantially more than minimum wage for the hours that she works, she struggles to find work on days when she's not working for me and the major part of her income is from the wages I pay her. The only Christmas bonus she gets is what I give her.\n\nI just can't afford to replace the present because my own finances are constrained during the festive season and I don't get a Christmas bonus myself but I know it will affect her harder than it affects me.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEta. She's not a thief. The things she's thrown out in the past wasn't really valuable beyond sentimental value. This is the first time it was something expensive. It was small and it was in a delivery box underneath packing paper so she thought it was just an empty box with packaging paper.", "created_utc": 1701273060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186skl8/aita_for_reducing_my_cleaning_ladys_bonus_for/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good cleaners are typically in high demand and the odds are she\u2019s struggling to find work BECAUSE she\u2019s been caught doing the same thing. Most people would dismiss someone after the second or third time. Also, are you sure she threw it away and didn\u2019t keep it?", "She repeatedly throws things away, and does not follow your rules to check with you first. Then she throws out a present (??? really? I'm side-eyeing this. She thought a present was trash?). Basically, you have multiple reasons to stop using her and find someone else. Maybe if she was better at her job she wouldn't struggle on the days she doesn't work for you. NTA", "If it was the first time, I would say it was a honest mistake and give her a pass, but if she repeatedly ignored your instruction, NTA and I agree with people saying you need a new cleaner.\n\nPs: are you sure that she threw everything away? Or could it be that she's keeping something to herself?", "Mistakes on her side are forgivable twice but not a third time.  Following instructions is required for continued employment. She is not following instructions, repeatedly.  Time for a new housekeeper.  I am a retired housekeeper.", "INFO if this is a repeated thing and she keeps destroying items you've told her not to, why do you still hire her?", "INFO : Are you sure she isn't throwing stuff out to later get them out of the bin for herself? \n\nI can't find another reason for someone throwing SOMEONE ELSE's stuff out, \n\nespecially after being told NUMEROUS TIMES NOT to do it.\n\nNTA", "NTA - your cleaning lady thinks you are naive.  She is right.  If the stuff had value for you, it can have value for her.  She is stealing it.", "Info: why did you leave an expensive gift in a pile of garbage?", "NTA. \nYou should fire your housekeeper though. It\u2019s not your job to support her. You don\u2019t need to feel guilty that she\u2019s not making money. Her finances are not your problem! Find a better maid than the one who comes into your home and disregards your rules.", "You need to clean up your clutter so she can tell a present from garbage.", "NTA.  She's struggling to get work elsewhere because she's not good at this job.  You can't trust someone with your home if they throw things away without even asking. It's very basic. She is responsible for any difficulty she is having, not you.\n\nI'd look for a trustworthy cleaner and pay above minimum wage to them, rather than this person.", "NTA, I agree, throw the cleaner out.", "NTA.\n\nI would\u2019ve fired her after that many issues.", "NTA.  It really sucks having to do that to somebody at this time of the year but this is a repeat offense and is not acceptable.  I would also let her know that this is her last chance.  It seems pretty odd that she would throw out an expensive present by accident, is it possible she's stealing??", "NTA.  Why does a cleaning lady throw out anything?  Are you leaving items lying around? Do you not put things away after you use them?  There would be no clutter if you did.\n\n Make a rule that she can't throw out anything, at all, period.  If she continues, then you will know the behavior is purposeful.  At that point you would need to let her go.", "NTA. Although the Christmas bonus could be called and end of employment gift.  The cleaning lady can\u2019t respect the simple instruction to not throw out things unless they are in the trashcan or unless she checks with you first. That doesn\u2019t seem like a lot to ask of an employee.", "NTA. But not sure why you're aren't just letting her go instead of reducing her bonus...", "Can you leave notes on things you don\u2019t want thrown away? I ask because the balance between not throwing important things away and doing an incomplete job with cleaning seems to be a tough one for people in this profession. My own cleaners have the opposite problem- they never seem to throw anything away even if it\u2019s fairly obviously fine to discard. Like, if an empty soda can is on the coffee table before they arrive, it\u2019s still there after.  I\u2019m honestly not sure which way I\u2019d prefer.\n\nNTA, though.", "YTA -  If you can't afford to pay your employees, you shouldn't have them.  If you can't give clear instructions, you can't blame your employee for making an error...it's kind of like playing darts blindfolded.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It matters a lot whether the bag of fabric was put away on a shelf or in a garbage bag on the floor.", "NTA\u2026.i wonder why she is struggling to find clients?  Not.  There is a reason.  You need to tell her if she throws one more thing away, she is fired immediately.  She is not there to throw things away.  She is there to clean.  Are you sure she is throwing things away?  Especially an expensive present.  I find that highly suspect.  I think she is stealing.", "NTA. Maybe she can\u2019t find other work because she\u2019s always throwing people\u2019s shit away", "That's what I was going to say. Rather than replacing the things she's thrown away, replace the cleaner altogether with someone who follows your directions. If this is a habit for her to throw things away you want to keep, then it's become a serious problem.\n\nNTA.", "She isn't a thief. She just did it by mistake. Nothing valuable like my jewelry has ever disappeared while she's been working for me.", "She isn't a thief and has never stolen anything. It was just a mistake on her side.", "She works hard and reduces my anxiety and stress immensely unless she does something like this. I'm on the autism spectrum and changing things hits me really hard. Not to mention that it's really hard to find someone who won't steal everything that isn't bolted down. Dealing with the occasional stress of this kind of thing is far better than dealing with full-time anxiety and stress.", "I've recovered things twice from the bin and her next working day was after garbage collection so I really don't think she's stealing. She's just careless.", "The gift was in an opened delivery box with the packaging paper on top of it. It also wasn't in the garbage. It was on a table in the kitchen without any garbage around it.", "She's not a thief. It was just a mistake on her side. The things she's thrown out in the past wasn't really valuable beyond sentimental value.", "She isn't malicious. She's just uneducated (like most of the people in our country) and has very little common sense about what's important even if it doesn't really have any financial value. I truly hope that she's learned her lesson and will remember to ask before throwing things out in the future.", "I don't think that putting notes on everything is practical because I will forget to put the notes on things due to my mental disabilities. I do however work from home and she can ask me anytime whether she can throw something out which I've told her to do multiple times in the past.", "You may be on to something about lack of clear instruction. The cleaning lady may be confused by OP\u2019s almost apologetic stance and defensiveness about how honest the cleaning lady is and it all is just a mistake, again. OP, try something along the lines of : \u201cDo not throw out my things. This is your last warning. If it happens again, you will be out of this job.\u201d", "The fabric was in a bag on a shelf. There were 2 lengths of fabric in the bag. I had used a big section of the one on top but was going to save the off cuts for quilting. So the off cuts were on top.

She tells me when I am low on cleaning supplies.\n\nHowever, she ALWAYS asks me whether to throw something out unless it is literally in the trash container or in a garbage bag. That is minimal level what one can expect.", "mistakes don't happen over and over!", "So you left an expensive gift out on the kitchen table in what could very easily have been mistaken for garbage? Why didn\u2019t you put the gift away when you got it? I don\u2019t know the specifics of the other times your cleaning person threw stuff away, but in this case you are kinda just as much to blame as her. In this instance it does seem like anyone could have mistaken the gift for an empty delivery box.  She could have double checked the box before tossing it, but you could have been more careful about where you leave expensive gifts.", "Once is a mistake, after that it\u2019s intent"]}
