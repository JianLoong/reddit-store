But going nuts isn't suddenly going to make the situation better. It just guarantees your son becomes stuck between to war waging parents. That's not okay. That's never okay. You are supposed to love your child more than you hate each other.\n\nIf it makes you feel better then you are right. Your ex should have taken you to court and petitioned for a name change. Just because your ex behaved badly doesn't mean you should as well. First discuss this with your ex, if your child is old enough then ask them their preference for a last name, if to young propose the fair system which is a hyphen last name. If your ex won't work with you go through mediation. Trust me on this - I've been a family lawyer a long time - the only winner from a legal shit storm is me, the lawyer, and my kids who come from a happy well adjusted family and go to expensive private schools paid for by ppl like you, while you struggle to pay your child's therapy bill from all the damage this shit causes.", "What is a Nex?", "NTA. Huge violation.", "I think he would have had to sign your name in order to do this without your knowledge. Your son doesn\u2019t have to know about this - it doesn\u2019t have to affect him.

Do not talk to nex about it and maybe don\u2019t talk to mom about it either if she\u2019s not going to be supportive. This is a good battle to choose, if you let nex get away with a change like this it will make him feel like he can get away with more going forward.

I do pro bono work all the time and through a combination of brand enhance, government funding and tax offsets it's pays nearly as well as my wealthier clients.  \n\nThe real issue is that your poor child already has enough to deal with if there is physically abuse - unsure why legal custody is still split, that's odd - and you plan to compound the child's problems with additional legal turmoil. \n\nOne day your child will be an adult, looking back on their childhood. You have the opportunity to create a clear moment where they can see that one of their parents valued them more then they hated the other parent. Those moments are invaluable. It's a name. It's only a name. It doesn't feel or think or cry or burn itself with a lighter. Your child meanwhile may do all of those things and worse. Worst custody cases a FL gets are those that end because the subject of the case has departed this life. Go to mediation and if it doesn't work out choose your child over a name that they can change themselves when they turn 18.", "Oh, make no mistake, my mother is not a doormat. I'm just expected to be and my partner refuses to let me be one. I am in therapy and my therapist doesn't like my ex nor my mother.", "So, throw plague-riddled bodies over the walls and into his house? I like it.", "I took this advice when I traded the title to my home for him to settle custody and I did it gladly. My son will NEVER know this, he doesn't need to know how i put him first. We already had mediation and he was told no. He got other things instead and was pleased with the trade. He doesn't care for rules. It wouldn't be the first time he was told no and took it anyway.", "I repeat, it's a name. A name feels no pain and has no life. A name is worthless. A child lives, they breathe, they feel pain. They have value.\n\nYour kid doesn't like the name, they can change it themselves at 18. I guarantee you, you are already going to spend a frig load of time in court over the next decade. Every second of that time will burn itself into your child's mind. Pick your battles. This battle isn't worth it.", "Nope his kid his name. while with her he let the bullshit slide like most men do. When they separated she lost that privilege. His kid! his name!."]}
