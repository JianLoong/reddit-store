Your step family sounds like entitled, spoiled people. To to take someone else\u2019s room in their own house and think that\u2019s OK it\u2019s just wrong. No one should be forced to give up their room when there\u2019s somewhere else they can sleep.", "NTA at all. It's your room and you have pets. You aren't the newest in the house/family, you all joined at the same time when your dad and stepmom started dating.\nGuests are beggars, they don't get to dictate where they sleep or who should offer what. Especially when they just decide last minute that they stay, uninvited.", "NTA. They are the ones in the wrong not you.\nThey are the ones who threw a fit when they didn't get their way, not you. Plus, who wants to give up their room with all their personal belongings in it to people with small children? They absolutely get into everything and parents rarely watch them. \n\nAdditionally, you said that they don't treat you like a member of the family. That's not ok. I think it's sad that your dad let them treat you like that, but in my experience the vast majority of men in his situation don't want to cause a fuss with their wife/stepchild either, so he certainly is not alone there.\n\nI think you should consider this a boundary you have established. Keep it in place. And don't let them treat you like crap.", "NTA - you\u2019re room is YOUR safe, private space. I\u2019m sorry that you were made to feel uncomfortable. They had no right to put you in that position. It\u2019s so important for adults to respect your boundaries.", "NTA, good for you for standing your ground. Why should you have to give up your space because they couldnt time their stay out better?", "NTA\n\nThey are the ones in the wrong here because they are throwing a fit.", "NTA. Don\u2019t doubt yourself for standing your ground.", "INFO: How far away do they live? Had the parents realized they had drunk too much to drive? How equipped were they to spend the night? How often does this happen? Could they not sleep on the couch?\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a family with 3 very little children decide to impromptu sleep somewhere else unless it is an emergency or there are very large extenuating circumstances. Babies (and some toddlers) typically need cribs or playpens to sleep in, lots of diapers, clean bottles, etc. Most parents also recognize the dangers in unsafe rooms (fish tanks, small toys, sharp edges) before anyone else. Outside of whatever family politics are at play, this whole thing is very odd and it feels like more info is needed.\n\nEdit: You also mention 3 bedrooms. If your parents have one, and you have the other, couldn\u2019t they have used the guest room?", "NTA - there was another perfectly good room for them to use.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus it\u2019s cool that your stepmom didn\u2019t try to force anything. She might not have said anything to prevent it becoming a worse situation, but she still supported you.", "NTA.  As far as their family dynamic goes with the youngest being the one to give up their room, you aren't really part of that and don't need to get pulled into their bullshit.  You've also given several reasons why the other available room is more suitable, regarding your pets and stuff.  Most important of all, it's YOUR room and they're assholes for demanding to use it.", "honestly, my dad is too scared of my stepmom + her family to say anything. they are quite nasty to him, some of my stepsiblings making up he said she said rumors about him. i\u2019m very nervous of that happening to me, so a part of me wants to make it clear that i don\u2019t want to be their doormat & the one always bending over backwards like my dad is. thank you for your reply btw!", "they live quite far away, an hour & a half without traffic. my stepbrother doesn\u2019t drink. they coke over for dinner VERY often, but rarely to sleep. they have 2 extra cots + a baby gate here, & my stepbrothers wife always has a baby bag with her (bottles, toys, diapers, etc) \n\nwe have 2 big couches, and a bedroom in the basement, but it gets coldish in the basement and they obviously didn\u2019t like the idea very much. again, it\u2019s usually the youngest who\u2019s supposed to sleep in the undesirable room/on the couch. \n\nabout the baby dangers, i guess they either didn\u2019t think that far ahead, or thought it\u2019d be fine because the babies would sleep quickly.", "Yeah, I\u2019m gunna say you\u2019re NTA. Even if it\u2019s your stepbrother\u2019s mom\u2019s house, they have their own little family unit now, and they\u2019re imposing on your normal life. They absolutely should\u2019ve taken the basement.", "NTA. You\u2019re not \u2018the youngest child\u2019, you\u2019re the only child of your parents. That the woman your father married had children beforehand does not place some sort of obligation on you to be a doormat. If they agreed that dynamic among themselves, that\u2019s their problem to sort out.", "Nope. It's YOUR room. The person who lives in it. With the furry creatures that his wife is allergic to. They can sleep in the other room, or on the sofa. F them. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIs this a US thing giving up rooms? Australian tend to be more put the inflatable matress on the loungeroom floor", "NTA you are not obligated to give your room up for anyone and you don\u2019t need multiple excuses\u2026NO is all the answer that need to be given. If your dads wife didn\u2019t step up your dad should have said something..", "NTA. Your stepmothers family sounds entitled and toxic af, but it seems your stepmom knows this because she wasn't phased at your refusal or their tantrum, and by the sounds of it didn't seem to care or try to force you. I'm wondering if your step mom escaped from an Ex that made the family like that in the first place and like your dad she's too scared to confront them.\n\nIt's time your stepmom (and dad) made their own family rules. \n\nAs soon as you're old enough and able get yourself out of that house so you don't need to be exposed to those entitled AHs anymore", "So you could go over to their house or apartment unannounced for dinner, decide to stay over, and insist they move the toddlers or baby out of their room because they are the youngest.\n\nThis is per their family rules.\n\nI would do this and see if they object.\nThen point out they are not following the rules, so the tradition ends.\n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nSleepovers should be planned in advance so you can prepare\n\nThat said yeah, kids give up their rooms when relatives come", "NTA - These people are unworthy of your respect, so when they say you are disrespectful they are correct and you should not care. You didn't marry these people, your dad did. Tell him to give up his own room.", "NTA", "NTA, they would have complained the rest of the time there about the allergies,  From now on, carry a pet or two around the house every time they visit.", "Your dad and stepmom need to come up with a plan for housing sleepover guests in the future. This family needs new traditions.", "NTA. Yes I usually offer up my youngest room to guests but after the age of 7 I started asking my child\u2019s feelings on it before making the offer. Children deserve respect and boundaries too.", "Quite. NTA.", "They sound like a gang of adult bullies. Like these are whole ass adults, some of whom having children, who want to be able to bully and assert dominance of a teenager and jeopardise their mothers happiness.\n\nThey absolutely suck. This isn\u2019t okay. They\u2019re bullies and someone needs to call them out. They\u2019re probably not going to listen to you, but your stepmom needs to tell them straight that if they can\u2019t be respectful to you, they don\u2019t need to come around until you move out. When she married your dad, she accepted that there was another kid in the house to take care of, not accepted a sacrificial lamb to throw to her gaggle of grown up bullies.", "Info: is this stepbrother the youngest of that set of kids? Are they trying to exert their dominance down to somebody else because they\u2019ve been beaten up their whole lives? \n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA, they\u2019re treating you poorly as a non member of their family. Time to lay down a hard rule. Your room is your space. They do not live there and are not entitled to it, nor are they welcome to stay in it at any time. If that doesn\u2019t work for them, they can stay elsewhere.", "NTA", "NTA. There\u2019s 3 bedrooms right? Not sure why it had to be your room.. there\u2019s another one", "NTA. \n\nI've given up rooms for older family members visiting for big events that don't happen often like a wedding or a funeral. Sometimes if they come in for a holiday from far away. \n\nBut frequent sleep overs is too disruptive.  Do not give up your room.", "NTA.\n\nYou have been eloquent in explaining why this would be a big problem. I hate to think of what would be done to your ferrets because of the woman's allergy, and, yes, toddlers love to get into your stuff and wreck it.\n\nI have to say as well that it sounds strange that your step-brother and his crew can't simply arrive for dinner, partake of dinner, say thank you, AND LEAVE. It suggests that he deliberately stays to assert his authority over you, and your parents should tell him to go home rather than play his psycho games in their house.", "They are just mad that their mom changed for her current family's dynamic. Not your problem", "I feel bad for you and your father. You sound like hostages in your own home. Maybe y'all would be better as a little duo."]}
