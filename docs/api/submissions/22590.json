I don\u2019t have an issue with either method. I personally don\u2019t use my phone, but I don\u2019t really care if others do so long as they\u2019re not disrupting the class. Which, 99.9% of the time, they\u2019re not. There\u2019s no music, no bright lights, just someone texting or scrolling social media. \n\nBut a select few make it a point to call it out every time. Some it\u2019s just a \u201chey, put it away\u201d but others really lay into the person and it derails class. As this is a summer session, we already have a limited number of classes and it\u2019s difficult when this professor is stopping class every few minutes.\n\nNow, I know the obvious solution is these people just stop using their phones. But that\u2019s out of anyone\u2019s control but theirs. Am I annoyed with them? Kind of but I also don\u2019t know their life and why they may need their phone.\n\nWhat can be controlled is stopping class so damn often and then lecturing for awhile. I\u2019ve tried to talk to the professor about this after class but he blew me off.\n\nToday was kind of the tipping point. One of the usual suspects was on her phone. Professor sees her and stops class to lecture her. She says she\u2019s not putting it away. Professor said he\u2019s not going back to the lecture until she does.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m pissed. We\u2019ve already spent 5 minutes on this, not accounting for another person he laid into before. I spoke up and said this isn\u2019t fair to the rest of us. We\u2019re trying to learn and this is eating into our time. The professor tried the whole \u201cbe upset with your peer\u201d and I said no. I said yes, maybe she shouldn\u2019t be using her phone, but it\u2019s not a distraction. THIS is the distraction. Someone else said they planned on reporting this to the head of the department (meaning the professor stopping class so often) and I agreed that may be best.\n\nMyself, Cell Phone Girl and Letter Writer were asked to leave class for the day. We later got an email on decorum. Letter Writer and I did submit a written complaint to the head of the department, stating that our learning was constantly disrupted and noting examples of us trying to speak with the professor before. \n\nSome people I\u2019ve spoken to say I was in the right. Others say I just should\u2019ve shut up and let it go. They pointed out the possible hypocrisy of me being upset class was derailed, then I made it worse. I see that point but also think the kerfuffle would\u2019ve continued as long as Cell Phone Girl didn\u2019t put her phone away. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n\nEDIT: So the common consensus among the YTAs is that I should\u2019ve just gone to the department head to start, given I already tried talking to the professor on my own. Which I can understand that pov and don\u2019t disagree. \n\nI want to clarify again: I am not mad about his policy. It is well within his rights. I am upset about how he executes it. Kicking her out takes 5 seconds vs going on a whole tangent multiple times throughout class.\n\nBut for those I shouldn\u2019t have submitted the complaint either\u2026what is your alternative? Some have said talk to the student. But if that doesn\u2019t work, we continued to fall behind on material and then we don\u2019t do well\u2026that\u2019s basically punishing those who aren\u2019t doing anything wrong.\n\nSo genuinely, how does this get fixed outside going above him?", "created_utc": 1689700934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1534jnh/aita_for_telling_my_professor_hes_causing_the/", "score": 3733, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems the only one distracted by the cell phone is the professor.  He either needs to ignore them or kick them out & be done with it.

Being a professor is one of the toughest jobs out there. You are not dealing with children, but grown adults who are supposed to want to educate themselves. Being on their phone might not distract you, but it does disrespect the professor and all the work they continuously have to do in order to provide said class. While the best course of action might have been to tell the cell phone user to leave the class, you were definitely humiliating the professor IMO, and also giving other students an excuse to continue using their phones in class.", "NTA. When I was in college it was before cell phones were commonplace (a few people had some very primitive versions so they weren\u2019t huge distractions). During one particular class a friend and I one day spent too much time whispering and writing notes to each other, which was the distraction that predated cell phones. We were technically adults at time but we were acting like children, being disrespectful to the professor. He pulled us aside after class and told us privately that we were becoming a distraction. We immediately apologized and didn\u2019t do it again. Point is, there is a way to correct distracting behavior, even at the college age, without humiliating the offender/wasting everyone else\u2019s time. We certainly should have known better and didn\u2019t necessarily deserve the respect on the professor\u2019s part, but it was much appreciated and we shaped up quick. This probably would have been a better way for this professor to handle the situation. I don\u2019t blame OP at all for being pissed their time was wasted.", "I'm finding it really weird that no one can read. Everyone saying \"you're the asshole, it's his class and he can have whatever rules he wants!\" literally just read the title of the post and then commented.\n\nOP doesn't care about the \"no phones\" rule. They care that class is being stopped for the phone person, and that they're falling behind on material. They'd rather the professor either drop it or kick the person out. *They do not care that they're not allowed their phone*. Why this is so hard for some people here to understand is bizarre.\n\nAlso shout-out to the professor in these comments who said \"Y T A you should have talked to him privately.\" Absolutely hilarious lack of reading comprehension from someone pretending to be a professor. Incredible.\n\nAnyways, NTA. Your learning time is being ruined by someone with a phone and someone who refuses to just kick them out of class. Sending the letter was the best option you had. You need to stand up for yourself. Your time and money are valuable, and it's shitty for the prof to waste both. You tried the other options, now you have to escalate. Personally, I would have gone straight to writing the letter from the failed in-person talks (without confronting him in class), but that's not super important here.", "Professor here.\n\nYTA\n\nThe professor is allowed to have this policy. Personally, I ignore cell phone use unless it's a serious distraction to me or others. But I have colleagues who do what your professor does. I will, however, stop the class if 2 people are having a side chat that is distracting. These people are violating a policy and stopping the class is well within their rights. \n\nYTA for bringing this up in class and undermining the professor. What you should have done is addressed the professor separately, such as after class, and told them that the disruptions are really a distraction. As if there are other solutions to the policy that would keep both the professor and other students happy. Maybe your prof doesn't see it from another student's perspective and needs to hear it. Calling them out in class just isn't cool.

You're all adults. So why the hell don't you just respect the rules? He's right, your anger should've been directed at the cell phone user. If she doesn't like his rule, she can complain to the appropriate person about that, but she still has to follow his rule until he's told otherwise. He should've kicked her out the moment she refused to put her phone away. What the hell makes her so entitled?\n\n Maybe a person using a cell phone is mostly distracting to themselves. But they're setting a poor example for others. And I do find it distracting to be sitting next to a person who's focused on their phone.", "NTA\n\nReport the prof and students.  They are stealing your money.", "Cell phone girl should have been asked to leave class until she could comply with professor\u2019s phone policy. This should be the professor\u2019s immediate stance going forward. No more phone lectures; just please exit my class until you can go without your phone. That\u2019s the easiest solution.\n\nEdited to add judgment. \n\nESH", "YTA - Your college classes are designed to prepare you for \"the real word\". You will have bosses that you will not like, don't care what you think and might be wrong. Guess what... Ya learn to deal with it. The professor made their policy crystal clear. The person you should be mad at is the student, not the professor.", "As a teacher, I prefer not to get into fights with my students about phones, it is just such a pain. But it is also my job to teach them, whether they like it or not. It's a cop out to say you get out what you put into it, part of our job is to motivate you to learn. And if I don't make class expectations clear about phones at least, other students will lose respect and start pulling out their phones. \n\nWhen you are using a phone in class you ARE distracting the class, because you are expressing your contempt and disrespect for the teacher and the class, and that actually does have a huge impact on the learning environment. One person does it, teacher let's it pass, ok I might as well do it too, and the next thing you know you've lost 30 percent of the class to phone usage.\n\nI would 100 percent rather you not come to class than sit there blatantly ignoring me. And it's always these ones that complain when they fail. They think their physical presence is enough for them to pass the class. \n\nAnd most teachers are held to a certain grade level. If all the students are failing because of phone usage, that teacher's job is actually in danger. In University it can prevent you from getting tenure, in public school it can keep you from getting your contact renewed. So now we have the epidemic of teachers passing students who shouldn't pass because otherwise they might lose their jobs \n\nAnd like I don't want to fight about it but I tell you to put you phone away, it's out three minutes later. I put out my hand for you to give me your phone until the end of class, you put it in your pocket, it's out again in 3 minutes. I have people playing literal video music on their phones, snapchatting in class.\n\nIf you behave this way you're asking for a fight.\n\nAnyone that's been teaching for some time has been struggling with phones for years. I can a hundred percent see why a teacher makes this their hill to die on.\n\nSo, ultimately, YTA.", "YTA - you are mad at the wrong person.

Classes be $$$ But your professor has this policy and it is 100% the rule breaker\u2019s fault that class is stopped.", "If you are over 12 and decide to not follow the lessons evemthough you decided to go there, that should be up to you.\n\nYou are old enough to understand, that you should use your time wisely and decided not to. Unless you are not interrupting the others on listing to the lesson, that should be your buisness.

Not the A H for your views. You addressing it in private was the right call, and I think the complaint with the dept head was fine. \n\nPersonally if my students are paying for their class, they can do what they like as long as they are not disruptive.

The cell phone users should get kicked out of the class. You are all adults, but many of you seem to still be acting like entitled children. I assume your professor is very frustrated by the disrespect to both them and the others in the class that are capable to acting like adults.

I can't imagine the chutzpah (derogatory) it takes for a student to tell a professor that the professor is disrupting the class the professor is literally teaching.", "I agree that being a professor is tough (I'm not going to say one of the toughest jobs out there, when so many people have it difficult in different ways). I agree students should treat them with respect and not ncesscairaly make things more difficult. \n\nThat being said, the other difference between elementary or high school students is that and college students is that they are paying thousands of dollars for the class. (At least where I live, if the class is free that may be different.) And I actually do think respect is mutual. Students should respect the professor but the professor should also show the class respect, and in this case that means respecting these young adults time and money. \n\nThese young adults are paying thousands of dollars, sometimes working long hours and/or going into massive debt to get to be in this class and learn. And the professor should respect that and care. I can somewhat understand if the professor didn't realize at first that constantly interrupting class to give lectures about how rude cell use is is actually harming everyone else in the class by cutting into their time. It shows a real lack of self-awareness and perspective taking on the professor's part, but we all make mistakes.\n\nHowever, at the point where OP went up and talked to the professor after class he should have started considering how his behavior impacts all of the diligent young people in class who are going into debt and trying their hardest. Just blaming the students who use their phones for his behavior is irresponsible and frankly not smart. He's continuing to use the same strategy every day that is both wasting everyone's time and also clearly not working. This isn't the professor making a thoughtful classroom management choice, this is the professor letting their feelings get the best of them and getting provoked constantly and going on rants beacuse they don't have the maturity to handle some students cell phone use/disrespectful behavior. I get that not everyone is mature enough to stay on task even when annoyed, but that's literally part of the professor's job. They need to use their limited class time for their students not their ego/feelings.\n\nThe professor's response to OP and other student who complained also shows that the professor dosen't really care about the rest of the class and their desire to learn. First, he brushed OP off completely when talked to in private. When in class he'd already wasted 5 entire minutes (do you know how LONG that feels?) for the second time that class and his students were so unhappy they pointed it out to him, he kicked them out. This does not reflect someone who respects their students and care that they are upset - and the reason they are upset is literally they want to hear him lecture! That's all they are asking, for him to please do his job and talk to them about his subject. Yet he does not care about their concerns, he just punishes them and dosen't address what they have to say. This is probably the same sort of emotional reaction that leads to him getting distracted lecturing how rude cell phone use is when a smart person should clearly see that isn't working and a waste of time. \n\nI want you to stop and consider how many dollars a minute they can't afford these young people are paying to hear him rant about cell phones instead of getting an education. And are they really wrong to ask him to please just teach them?", "\"undermining the professor\"? This is a group of adults, not a fifth grade class. University costs 10s of thousands of dollars. If the professor is falling behind on instruction because he is not doing his job in such a way as to be able to cover the material, it should be fine to call him out on it.  Or do you think a professor should be revered as some sort of holy man or something?", "I did talk to him about it though in private, several times (which is in the post, by the way). He wasn\u2019t receptive nor even wanted to hear me out. I totally respect his rule and don\u2019t care it\u2019s in place. As I said, I follow it myself.\n\nGenuine question\u2026what would\u2019ve been a better next step, seeing as talking in private didn\u2019t work?

Most say I wasn\u2019t wrong to write the letter, just that I voiced my frustrations in the middle of class. \n\nFor those that think that I shouldn\u2019t have submitted a complaint : what should I have done? What is the solution? I\u2019ve already spoken to him privately about how we are behind on the material and this is a short class. \n\nSo, let\u2019s say I stayed quiet, ignored it and didn\u2019t write a letter of complaint.

He was a studio professor and he was wholly unequipped to guide our semester studio projects.\n\nHe was constantly tossing in weird and unhelpful advice, not actually giving feedback to students and when reviews would roll around with actual panel reviewers in the field if the project was being critiqued more then he would immediately start throwing the student under the bus. He also said some not so ok things to some of the foreign students which was outlandish given he is also a foreigner too. \n\nIt got to the point I would give him two option questions like do you like A or B. \n\nAt the end of the semester (his second at the school) we went to the dean and made it clear we felt like our money had been wasted. That he had been insulting and unhelpful and untethered from our projects often just musing about random things. Turns out the previous class had complained too and another professor was supposed to tag team our class with this guy but that fell through. \n\nThe following semester they had permanently moved him to the undergraduate college. \n\nWe realized he was moved there because undergrads are less likely to complain because they don\u2019t recognize that they are the ones purchasing that class and deserve for it to be run effectively. So we (the graduate students) continued to complain, those of us who where TA\u2019s for him since undergrads get graduate TA\u2019s for studio also complained and finally he was moved to an elective lecturing position. \n\nHe also lied on his resume. \n\nMoral of the story.

Basically, she felt her class was the only possible thing we could have scheduled for that day if we actually valued our educations, and also, she said she knew how the human body worked and that adults don't need to use the bathrooms that frequently).\n\nAnyway, there was an immediate outcry/ pushback to this policy when she announced it, and she just doubled down, then got mad and kicked us all out and ended class early. \n\nI think some of the students must have complained to the dean of instruction, because the next time we met, she apologized and said we could use the bathroom, \"at our discretion,\" during classtime.\n\nSometimes people in charge disrupt their own teams or classes practically on their own.", "Exactly this.

You better believe I\u2019m gonna check my messages when someone is watching my kids.", "and clearly she doesn\u2019t care about peer pressure about putting the phone away.", "Also he straight up kicked you out for pointing out he was wrong because he couldn't \"win\" the argument\n\nNTA you're right to report him if only for your own protection in case he retaliates more", "Yeah kick them our, talk to the authorities, put a notice on the board, appoint a moniter near the entrance but nah. Some old people actually like seeing young people seemings doing stupid young people thing so they can get a chance to have a ego trip. I have seen them doing it even when the young people haven't done anything wrong. Like you can texting something important, like about the money you immediately need for your mother's surgery and an older guy watching you in the train will judge you for being a smartphone addict and laugh at you. They will  also make sure that you know that they are laughing at you.", "I learn better when I'm able to split my attention a teensy bit. I swear to God, I *am* listening but I need to distract the monkey brain a bit while I'm doing so. I used to draw during classes and had a boomer lecturer get big mad I wasn't paying attention. I got some of the highest marks in that course but I was distracting others, apparently. Eventually she pulled me aside to yell at me and I unleashed on her. Said despite my drawing in class I was still getting high marks, I wasn't distracted during practicals but I couldn't tell her shit about her important class because she'd made me give up my study aids for her comfort. Eventually another lecturer had a go at her too because her attitude was making it hard for neurodiverse students to study.", "I\u2019m glad to hear from someone else who learns best that way! Luckily in uni I got left alone, but prior to that I\u2019d get bitched at for reading an unrelated book, doing other classes\u2019s homework, doodling\u2026you name it. If I try to focus 100% on them talking and such, and my brain hasn\u2019t decided this is something cool and it\u2019s time to hyperfocus, it feels like every tiny sound drowns out the instructor\u2019s voice, and I can\u2019t learn shit. Happens with regular conversations sometimes too, I swear something like a bird chirping feels like it\u2019s in my head doing it and I can\u2019t hear or focus. I work best split between doing one thing and listening to something else.\n\n\nSo yeah, probably related - I was diagnosed with ADHD 7-8 years after finishing my degrees. Being AFAB and not the stereotypical \u201chyperactive boy who refuses to listen to anyone\u201d ADHD patient is awesome! But seriously I\u2019m glad neurodivergence in girls/women has something of a spotlight on it and more are getting the help they need to manage it.", "Got diagnosed as autistic 6 years ago, years after I finished my first degree. I'm back at school now and burnt out as fuck and apparently that makes me resemble ADHD a *lot*. When I'm not burned out, it's fine but when I am? Can't control or regulate shit.\n\nWe need to move away from making everyone conform to some kind of 'normal'. Because the people who decide what normal is aren't, themselves, normal. Their expectations are completely skewed and it makes everyone else suffer.", "NTA, there's always some professors who seem to act like they're teaching 13 year olds in mandatory education.\n\nIf someone wanted to show up to something that they pay for and just put noise cancelling headphones in and not participate at all then that's entirely their prerogative. Yes it may be rude, but everyone else is paying for the lecturers attention/contributions, not the uninterested students. \n\nPersonally I'd be mortified if I had to be reminded by a student in class that I need to stay on track and focus on teaching rather than parenting adults.", "You are lucky... I had a professor refuse to allow me to sit the final exam because I had missed over 30% of classes (I missed 35%!) despite the fact that I got permission from the dean to miss classes (due to a combination of ADHD, autism and claustrophobia making some classes intolerable)", "Is there something in the comments about it being a community college? They said \"my university\" in the OP... maybe I missed it..", "Downvote all you want, but the truth is that educating young people is something we all pay for.  So the entitled \"I pay your salary\" bullshit and the entitled attitude that goes with it does not fly.", "The prof is acting quite normal: Adressing interuptions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is an AH, lamenting the interuptins while interupting even mre themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: The problem with that kind of summer school is: It's only those students that did not make it during the year. So the level of competence and the progress is limited by that, not by the time taken to refocus the students.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgreed, the reasonable approach would be to kick those not wanting to participate out. But the Prof does not have that option. Since grades are not an effective motivation either (most of those students are obviously not sufficientliy by passing grades, or they would not be there), the only vialbe approach is repeating the \"put the phone away\". If you accept some phones, there will be more, and the learning environment WILL get worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA thankless job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd don't forget: If OP were a reasonably good student, or would understand how to learn efficiently, he would not be there.", "YTA it\u2019s much harder to be in front of the class than sitting in it. You saw him in a difficult situation and decided to make it worse by ganging up on him publicly and further disrupting the lecture. You could have said something to the girl but chose him as the easier target. There\u2019s no justification for it and it\u2019s really immature (at best) behaviour, seriously have some empathy. You could have gone to the dept head about the execution of his policy and if that doesn\u2019t resolve it than just deal because it\u2019s really not that big of a deal.", "It's not a power trip to not want phones in the class.  Maybe the ones on their phones too much can grow up.", "Yeah, I tutor university students and it is extraordinarily distracting when people use their phones. A huge component of lecturing is being able to gauge the reactions and understanding of your audience and that's gone when the phone comes out. The comments about \"I pay you to teach\" are astonishingly entitled. Reminds me of bosses trying to get contractors to clean their car or toilets once they've finished their work. \n\nThe professor is entitled to good working conditions just as anybody else is, he doesn't have to put up with crap like this, he isn't paid to put up with crap, he is paid to deliver a course to a group of adults who are enthusiastic about their education.", "They did follow the professor's rules. Did you not read the post?", "OP isn't objecting to the rule. OP is objecting to their learning being disrupted by how the rule is enforced. He can just kick the person out with a couple words and carry on, but insists on going on a long rant instead every single time.", ">It's rude as hell.\n\nI agree. I always felt bad when the professor looked at me looking at my phone.\n\n\n>many students don't turn off the volume\n \nBut this is not useful for your argument. This is simply not true. People who are on their phones are almost always on silent not the opposite. The professor needs to learn to filtrate and teach the other ones who are actually paying attention.", "Some people actually learn better that way. Especially people with ADHD. Please educate yourself before saying these things.", "Ikr some people just can't understand that everyone learns at their own pace and in their own way. I doodle too during lectures bcz it helps a lot, I can't listen to my teachers and focus only on them. I NEED to do something with my hands or else I'll lose focus and start thinking about sciency-space-physics shit. \nI can't recall the number of times someone has told me to pay attention or called me out. I really enjoy learning new things but I wish my teachers would understand that I'm actually paying attention.", "I used to bring mandarins to class so I could slowly peel them and remove every last stringy bit of the pith while listening to the lectures. My hands needed SOMETHING to do, or my mind was going to wander. \n\nGuess who also got diagnosed with (inattentive) ADHD?", ">what is your alternative?\n\nHere's my suggestion:\n\n1. Write an email to your professor, apologizing for arguing and causing a distraction (no, just apologize, then we can move on to the next step.)\n\n2. Propose that your teacher implement a new, no-argument, policy.\n\n3. The new policy: From now on, anyone using their phone in class will be marked absent for that day.\n\n4.  There will be no discussion or argument about it in class. Argumentative students will be asked to leave.\n\n5. The unexcused absences will count up the same as any other absence. \n\n6. If the unexcused absences add up, the student will be failed from the class.\n\n7. Remind the professor that if enough students are not paying attention in class, the traditional teaching tool is surprise quizzes. It's effective.\n\nIn conclusion - \n\n8. Don't approach the other student. It's not your job.\n\n9. If there's something you're confused about that isn't covered in class, don't hesitate to ask the professor during office hours."]}
