Most say, \u201cit\u2019s your grade, you get what you put into it\u201d. Others will say it affects your grade but they won\u2019t call you out on it, just mark it in their book under participation. I don\u2019t have an issue with either method. I personally don\u2019t use my phone, but I don\u2019t really care if others do so long as they\u2019re not disrupting the class. Which, 99.9% of the time, they\u2019re not. There\u2019s no music, no bright lights, just someone texting or scrolling social media. \n\nBut a select few make it a point to call it out every time. Some it\u2019s just a \u201chey, put it away\u201d but others really lay into the person and it derails class. As this is a summer session, we already have a limited number of classes and it\u2019s difficult when this professor is stopping class every few minutes.\n\nNow, I know the obvious solution is these people just stop using their phones. But that\u2019s out of anyone\u2019s control but theirs. Am I annoyed with them? Kind of but I also don\u2019t know their life and why they may need their phone.\n\nWhat can be controlled is stopping class so damn often and then lecturing for awhile. I\u2019ve tried to talk to the professor about this after class but he blew me off.\n\nToday was kind of the tipping point. One of the usual suspects was on her phone. Professor sees her and stops class to lecture her. She says she\u2019s not putting it away. Professor said he\u2019s not going back to the lecture until she does.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m pissed. We\u2019ve already spent 5 minutes on this, not accounting for another person he laid into before. I spoke up and said this isn\u2019t fair to the rest of us. We\u2019re trying to learn and this is eating into our time. The professor tried the whole \u201cbe upset with your peer\u201d and I said no. I said yes, maybe she shouldn\u2019t be using her phone, but it\u2019s not a distraction. THIS is the distraction. Someone else said they planned on reporting this to the head of the department (meaning the professor stopping class so often) and I agreed that may be best.\n\nMyself, Cell Phone Girl and Letter Writer were asked to leave class for the day. We later got an email on decorum. Letter Writer and I did submit a written complaint to the head of the department, stating that our learning was constantly disrupted and noting examples of us trying to speak with the professor before. \n\nSome people I\u2019ve spoken to say I was in the right. Others say I just should\u2019ve shut up and let it go. They pointed out the possible hypocrisy of me being upset class was derailed, then I made it worse. I see that point but also think the kerfuffle would\u2019ve continued as long as Cell Phone Girl didn\u2019t put her phone away. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n\nEDIT: So the common consensus among the YTAs is that I should\u2019ve just gone to the department head to start, given I already tried talking to the professor on my own. Which I can understand that pov and don\u2019t disagree. \n\nI want to clarify again: I am not mad about his policy. It is well within his rights. I am upset about how he executes it. Kicking her out takes 5 seconds vs going on a whole tangent multiple times throughout class.\n\nBut for those I shouldn\u2019t have submitted the complaint either\u2026what is your alternative? Some have said talk to the student. But if that doesn\u2019t work, we continued to fall behind on material and then we don\u2019t do well\u2026that\u2019s basically punishing those who aren\u2019t doing anything wrong.\n\nSo genuinely, how does this get fixed outside going above him?", "created_utc": 1689700934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1534jnh/aita_for_telling_my_professor_hes_causing_the/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just kick the student out that isn't following the rules. Don't punish everyone. This isn't high school. You are paying him to teach this class.  \n\nWas it rude to call him out in front of the class?  Yes, absolutely. But he was also being rude to everyone else in that classroom when he refused to do his job because of one person.  \n\nGoing above him before this happened would have been best.

Being a professor is one of the toughest jobs out there. You are not dealing with children, but grown adults who are supposed to want to educate themselves. Being on their phone might not distract you, but it does disrespect the professor and all the work they continuously have to do in order to provide said class. While the best course of action might have been to tell the cell phone user to leave the class, you were definitely humiliating the professor IMO, and also giving other students an excuse to continue using their phones in class.", "NTA. When I was in college it was before cell phones were commonplace (a few people had some very primitive versions so they weren\u2019t huge distractions). During one particular class a friend and I one day spent too much time whispering and writing notes to each other, which was the distraction that predated cell phones. We were technically adults at time but we were acting like children, being disrespectful to the professor. He pulled us aside after class and told us privately that we were becoming a distraction. We immediately apologized and didn\u2019t do it again. Point is, there is a way to correct distracting behavior, even at the college age, without humiliating the offender/wasting everyone else\u2019s time. We certainly should have known better and didn\u2019t necessarily deserve the respect on the professor\u2019s part, but it was much appreciated and we shaped up quick. This probably would have been a better way for this professor to handle the situation. I don\u2019t blame OP at all for being pissed their time was wasted.", "I'm finding it really weird that no one can read. Everyone saying \"you're the asshole, it's his class and he can have whatever rules he wants!\" literally just read the title of the post and then commented.\n\nOP doesn't care about the \"no phones\" rule. They care that class is being stopped for the phone person, and that they're falling behind on material. They'd rather the professor either drop it or kick the person out. *They do not care that they're not allowed their phone*. Why this is so hard for some people here to understand is bizarre.\n\nAlso shout-out to the professor in these comments who said \"Y T A you should have talked to him privately.\" Absolutely hilarious lack of reading comprehension from someone pretending to be a professor. Incredible.\n\nAnyways, NTA. Your learning time is being ruined by someone with a phone and someone who refuses to just kick them out of class. Sending the letter was the best option you had. You need to stand up for yourself. Your time and money are valuable, and it's shitty for the prof to waste both. You tried the other options, now you have to escalate. Personally, I would have gone straight to writing the letter from the failed in-person talks (without confronting him in class), but that's not super important here.", "Professor here.\n\nYTA\n\nThe professor is allowed to have this policy. Personally, I ignore cell phone use unless it's a serious distraction to me or others. But I have colleagues who do what your professor does. I will, however, stop the class if 2 people are having a side chat that is distracting. These people are violating a policy and stopping the class is well within their rights. \n\nYTA for bringing this up in class and undermining the professor. What you should have done is addressed the professor separately, such as after class, and told them that the disruptions are really a distraction. As if there are other solutions to the policy that would keep both the professor and other students happy. Maybe your prof doesn't see it from another student's perspective and needs to hear it. Calling them out in class just isn't cool. Professors have a hard enough time maintaining any sort of authority.", "NTA", "i\u2019m literally paying to be there, i\u2019ll do whatever i want during that class period.

His class his rules. If you don't like it either talk to cell phone girl or drop his class. \n\nYou only made the situation worse lol", "YTA, because the rule in his class is no cell phone use. You're all adults. So why the hell don't you just respect the rules? He's right, your anger should've been directed at the cell phone user. If she doesn't like his rule, she can complain to the appropriate person about that, but she still has to follow his rule until he's told otherwise. He should've kicked her out the moment she refused to put her phone away. What the hell makes her so entitled?\n\n Maybe a person using a cell phone is mostly distracting to themselves. But they're setting a poor example for others. And I do find it distracting to be sitting next to a person who's focused on their phone.", "NTA\n\nReport the prof and students.  They are stealing your money.", "Cell phone girl should have been asked to leave class until she could comply with professor\u2019s phone policy. This should be the professor\u2019s immediate stance going forward. No more phone lectures; just please exit my class until you can go without your phone. That\u2019s the easiest solution.\n\nEdited to add judgment. \n\nESH", "YTA - Your college classes are designed to prepare you for \"the real word\". You will have bosses that you will not like, don't care what you think and might be wrong. Guess what... Ya learn to deal with it. The professor made their policy crystal clear. The person you should be mad at is the student, not the professor.", "As a teacher, I prefer not to get into fights with my students about phones, it is just such a pain. But it is also my job to teach them, whether they like it or not. It's a cop out to say you get out what you put into it, part of our job is to motivate you to learn. And if I don't make class expectations clear about phones at least, other students will lose respect and start pulling out their phones. \n\nWhen you are using a phone in class you ARE distracting the class, because you are expressing your contempt and disrespect for the teacher and the class, and that actually does have a huge impact on the learning environment. One person does it, teacher let's it pass, ok I might as well do it too, and the next thing you know you've lost 30 percent of the class to phone usage.\n\nI would 100 percent rather you not come to class than sit there blatantly ignoring me. And it's always these ones that complain when they fail. They think their physical presence is enough for them to pass the class. \n\nAnd most teachers are held to a certain grade level. If all the students are failing because of phone usage, that teacher's job is actually in danger. In University it can prevent you from getting tenure, in public school it can keep you from getting your contact renewed. So now we have the epidemic of teachers passing students who shouldn't pass because otherwise they might lose their jobs \n\nAnd like I don't want to fight about it but I tell you to put you phone away, it's out three minutes later. I put out my hand for you to give me your phone until the end of class, you put it in your pocket, it's out again in 3 minutes. I have people playing literal video music on their phones, snapchatting in class.\n\nIf you behave this way you're asking for a fight.\n\nAnyone that's been teaching for some time has been struggling with phones for years. I can a hundred percent see why a teacher makes this their hill to die on.\n\nSo, ultimately, YTA.", "YTA - you are mad at the wrong person. It\u2019s such a weird stance to take the side of the stubborn rule breaker instead of the person enforcing the rules.

Classes be $$$ But your professor has this policy and it is 100% the rule breaker\u2019s fault that class is stopped.", "If you are over 12 and decide to not follow the lessons evemthough you decided to go there, that should be up to you.\n\nYou are old enough to understand, that you should use your time wisely and decided not to. Unless you are not interrupting the others on listing to the lesson, that should be your buisness. Your next test results will tell you, if that was a good decision or not.\n\nLecturing adults is just plain dumb in my opinion. They wont change their minds or behaviour, especially not over a stupid lecture or a bad mark or so...\nYou are way above kindergarten age and should be treated as young adults. Period.\n\nSterling precious time from the leaaons is to 100% on the prof.

Not the A H for your views. You addressing it in private was the right call, and I think the complaint with the dept head was fine. \n\nPersonally if my students are paying for their class, they can do what they like as long as they are not disruptive.

The cell phone users should get kicked out of the class. You are all adults, but many of you seem to still be acting like entitled children. I assume your professor is very frustrated by the disrespect to both them and the others in the class that are capable to acting like adults. He should just give them a mark for non participation and kick them out rather than derailing the class. \n\nYou should have just communicated with the head of the department rather than making a scene and getting kicked out of class.

I agree students should treat them with respect and not ncesscairaly make things more difficult. \n\nThat being said, the other difference between elementary or high school students is that and college students is that they are paying thousands of dollars for the class. (At least where I live, if the class is free that may be different.) And I actually do think respect is mutual. Students should respect the professor but the professor should also show the class respect, and in this case that means respecting these young adults time and money. \n\nThese young adults are paying thousands of dollars, sometimes working long hours and/or going into massive debt to get to be in this class and learn. And the professor should respect that and care. I can somewhat understand if the professor didn't realize at first that constantly interrupting class to give lectures about how rude cell use is is actually harming everyone else in the class by cutting into their time. It shows a real lack of self-awareness and perspective taking on the professor's part, but we all make mistakes.\n\nHowever, at the point where OP went up and talked to the professor after class he should have started considering how his behavior impacts all of the diligent young people in class who are going into debt and trying their hardest. Just blaming the students who use their phones for his behavior is irresponsible and frankly not smart. He's continuing to use the same strategy every day that is both wasting everyone's time and also clearly not working. This isn't the professor making a thoughtful classroom management choice, this is the professor letting their feelings get the best of them and getting provoked constantly and going on rants beacuse they don't have the maturity to handle some students cell phone use/disrespectful behavior. I get that not everyone is mature enough to stay on task even when annoyed, but that's literally part of the professor's job. They need to use their limited class time for their students not their ego/feelings.\n\nThe professor's response to OP and other student who complained also shows that the professor dosen't really care about the rest of the class and their desire to learn. First, he brushed OP off completely when talked to in private. When in class he'd already wasted 5 entire minutes (do you know how LONG that feels?) for the second time that class and his students were so unhappy they pointed it out to him, he kicked them out. This does not reflect someone who respects their students and care that they are upset - and the reason they are upset is literally they want to hear him lecture! That's all they are asking, for him to please do his job and talk to them about his subject. Yet he does not care about their concerns, he just punishes them and dosen't address what they have to say. This is probably the same sort of emotional reaction that leads to him getting distracted lecturing how rude cell phone use is when a smart person should clearly see that isn't working and a waste of time. \n\nI want you to stop and consider how many dollars a minute they can't afford these young people are paying to hear him rant about cell phones instead of getting an education. And are they really wrong to ask him to please just teach them?", "\"undermining the professor\"? This is a group of adults, not a fifth grade class. University costs 10s of thousands of dollars. If the professor is falling behind on instruction because he is not doing his job in such a way as to be able to cover the material, it should be fine to call him out on it.  Or do you think a professor should be revered as some sort of holy man or something?", "I did talk to him about it though in private, several times (which is in the post, by the way). He wasn\u2019t receptive nor even wanted to hear me out. I totally respect his rule and don\u2019t care it\u2019s in place. As I said, I follow it myself.\n\nGenuine question\u2026what would\u2019ve been a better next step, seeing as talking in private didn\u2019t work? As I said, this isn\u2019t a thing for him alone so I\u2019d like to know how I could improve for next time.\n\nThank you for taking time to give input.", "> But I have colleagues who do what your professor does.\n\nDo you think they're pathetic?", "Pointing out an incredibly flawed system that's ruining their limited time in the classroom for no reason other than.. a want to rant about phones ,, or to not work is not 'undermining' somebody.", "or you can trust the grown adults can check their phone AND be learning too.\n\nPeople have lived outside of school that may require phone contact at any given time.", "Nah, you paid for the lazy river.", "To the professor, not to me.\n\nThat being said, I suppose then it\u2019s all up to who\u2019s discomfort matters most.

Nor do I feel comfortable talking to her as again, I don\u2019t know why she has her phone out. Perhaps it\u2019s something as trivial as scrolling Twitter OR maybe there\u2019s a bigger reason. Which, she really should\u2019ve communicated to the professor if that was the case.", "> Your misdirecting your anger.\n\nWho should it be directed at?

I say in my op that I don\u2019t care about the rule. It\u2019s how he executes it.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the alternative? I\u2019m genuinely curious. Most say I wasn\u2019t wrong to write the letter, just that I voiced my frustrations in the middle of class. \n\nFor those that think that I shouldn\u2019t have submitted a complaint : what should I have done? What is the solution? I\u2019ve already spoken to him privately about how we are behind on the material and this is a short class. \n\nSo, let\u2019s say I stayed quiet, ignored it and didn\u2019t write a letter of complaint. What is the solution for the class not going well and potentially affecting my grade? I am genuinely asking this.\n\nConsidering I have a 4.0 GPA and have never had an issue with a professor in 3 years, I am ready for college. But you can have that opinion.", "Well, at this point given how far behind we are due to both assholes breaking the rule and him lecturing them for several minutes, I guess that\u2019s the case either way.", "Unfortunately, it\u2019s too late to switch the class. It\u2019s a summer session so it\u2019s shorter and we\u2019re already half through. That was part of my frustration and something I brought up to him in private, as well as the department head. It\u2019s already such a short session and we\u2019re so behind because he stops for cellphone users. Financial aid doesn\u2019t cover these classes, so I had to pay a lot for it. (Summer sessions are more expensive than regular semesters)\n\nThat being said\u2026none of this is the professor\u2019s problem and you\u2019re right I should\u2019ve just skipped to talking to the department head.", "You\u2019re right. He does get to determine how cell phones are handled in his own class. And Phone Girl was rude af to continue to use her phone. But when his irritation delays class for long periods of time and forces everyone to listen to his rants, it becomes inappropriate. As I said, a quick, \u201cget off your phone or leave/I\u2019ll dock points\u201d should be all that is necessary. \n\nI don\u2019t believe that a college classroom is a democracy where students\u2019 opinions have equal weight.
