We have 5 children together. His wage pays for the mortgage, his car insurance and the groceries. I am recently disabled, and have been very unwell the past few years.

From this I pay for all the bills - council tax, gas, electric, broadband, mobile phones, school fees, car insurance, water bills, life insurance, and any food outside of the grocery shop, including pet food. I also cover any clothing the kids need and they always need something! Because of my previous jobs I had a large overdraft which is all that\u2019s keeping me going currently. I\u2019ve asked my husband today if he could give me a little help with Christmas this year, as he recently got a pay rise. And he said no. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable in asking for a little help. But all he says is \u201cI pay the mortgage.\u201d He even reluctantly gives me the grocery money.\n\n As a mother of 5 I do not stop all day everyday even though I\u2019m unwell.

Why do so many people keep separate finances and then refuse to help their SO when circumstances change?  You and your husband need to have a combined account for combined expenses.

It doesn't sound like a marriage but more of a failing business partnership you have with your husband.  It's no longer a 50/50 situation due to your disability and he's refusing to change the original agreement.  Therefore, you need to protect yourself and your children by gathering up all of your financial documents, medical information, and discuss your options with a divorce attorney without your husband's knowledge as a pre-emptive strike.  He's made it clear by your statement **He even reluctantly gives me the grocery money** that he has no interest in supporting you or the children emotionally for financially, so you need protection put in place before he decides to potentially leave you destitute.

All money is family income until everything you agree upon having is paid for.

You say he pays 900 for the mortgages and has another 900ish (assume after tax).  You say he pays his car insurance (let's hope that's not huge), probably petrol as well, and... groceries for...

In any case, this situation is untenable. Everything needs to go into one account that everything's paid from. That makes it easier to see where your family finances actually stand.
