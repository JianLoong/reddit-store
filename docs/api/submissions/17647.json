He is the type of guy that brags about how he never changed a diaper. \n\nJennifer and Harper are usually at Amber and my house  on the weekends because Harper\u2019s dad is drinking and watching sports all weekend. On Saturdays I normally sped all day with my daughter because I don\u2019t see her as much as i want to during the week. However with Harper being there every Saturday  anything I do with Emma I have to do with Harper. Take Emma to the zoo it\u2019s Emma, Harper and I. Taught them both how to ride bikes, takes them both to dance class, take them both to the kids salon, and so on.  \n\nMother\u2019s Day was the last draw, I took them both to dance class Saturday morning ( Amber and I also pay for both dance classes because dead beet won\u2019t)  on the way home Emma asked if we could stop to get something for mom for Mother\u2019s Day, I said sure but then it ended up I had to buy something for Harper to her her mom as well. On the way home I just kept thinking why am I buying someone else\u2019s wife a Mother\u2019s Day gift, that\u2019s his job.\n\nA few days later (because I did not want to ruin Mother\u2019s Day) I told my wife that I am tired of raising Harper, her real father needs to step up. I tired of it taking away time I get to spend with Emma. She said that  Jennifer is her best friend and we need to be there for Harper.\n\nNow she is not speaking to me and sleeping in the guest bedroom. So AITA?\n\nJust wanted to add some updates to questions I see.\n\nEmma and Harper are best friends.\n\nIt was my idea to spend Saturday with Emma, I work more during the week so I wanted to spend Saturday with Emma and to give my wife a bit of a break.\n\nWe pay for things be Jennifer\u2019s husband thinks it\u2019s a waste on money to pay for dance class and Jennifer can\u2019t afford to pay by herself. \n\nJennifer and Harper do things with Amber and Emma 1 or 2 times a week together during the weeknights.", "created_utc": 1684500546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lujjo/aita_for_telling_my_wife_im_tired_of_raising_a/", "score": 10475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your wife wants to step up for Harper, then SHE needs to do that, not put it on you. She should be taking her places and doing things with her", "NTA. As you say, it is robbing you of the time you could otherwise spend with your daughter, one on one. Best friend is one thing - virtually living in your house is another thing.", "NTA\n\nStop taking Harper, it's that simple. You're having dad daughter bonding time and don't want a tagalong. \n\nIf Harper wants to come along on these things then make her mother come with you all, but not your wife.", "NTA but I don't think anyone is addressing the bigger picture.\n\nIt sounds like Jennifer is keeping harper away from her father for her well being (you mentioned drinking) \n\nIf Jennifer is an abusive relationship you and your wife need to support and encourage her to leave.\n\nYour wife may be aware, which is why she was so defensive about wanting her to be there.\n\nEdit - spelling", "NTA- personally I\u2019d never be able to not take in a kid that needed it, a lot of kids with shitty parents have their mental health saved by the kindness of friends parents who step up. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s not something you\u2019re required to do. I do feel bad for the kid though, none of this is her fault.", "NTA. Your wife needs to prioritize y'all's family and not her friend's. You should be able to have peace in your own home.", "NTA, I think your wife\u2019s heart is in the right place but it\u2019s become too much. Maybe you could frame it differently by telling your wife you want to have 1-1 time with your daughter and also make sure that the three of you have time to spend alone together as a family.", "Info: how does Emma feel about sharing every Saturday with Harper?", "NTA,  first I want to say you and your wife are good for doing all that you have done,  it will probably be memories the little girl will cherish because her dad is an ass.  Now you don't have to do anything for her. Yes it may be harsh for her to not go to everything you and your daughter do but she is not your kid.  Her father sounds like a butt , and her mom keeps her in that situation is not good.  \n      Just remember you can just want dad and daughter time and if your wife or her best friend says anything you just tell them you wanted a special day with just your kid and any good father should want that.   Don't feel bad for not wanting to raise a child that is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your wife is in denial. Harper is not your daughter, and you do not have any legal obligations to spend time with her. When your wife calms down, you need to call a meeting with Jennifer and Harper's father and be very clear in communicating your feelings. If Harper's father is truly neglectful, Jennifer needs to take action against him and file for divorce, and obtain full custody. Your wife needs to see the big picture.", "NTA. But FWIW, your daughter probably has more fun with a little friend there, and you're doing a good thing. My next-door neighbor's grandparents did the same for me when I was a kid/teen bc my parents worked all the time. I loved them so much and am very grateful for the time and love they invested in a \"grandkid\" who wasn't theirs. \n\nYes, not your problem. Yes, your wife needs to talk to Jennifer about it. Yes, NTA. BUT it sounds like Emma's dad sucks, and you don't, and I think every kid deserves to have adults rooting for them. It would be really nice of y'all to find a balance and for you still be there for her when you can - for your kid's sake at the minimum!", "NAH, except obviously the AH dad. That said, how does your daughter feel about everything? Because I am pretty sure she views that girl as a sister at this point. \n\nYou do sound really cold towards a child who has done nothing wrong but be born. \n\nYou and the wife need to come to an agreement on this though.", "NTA your wife is enabling her best friends behavior. She's equally complicit in this.", "By your title I thought you were talking about a step kid and I\u2019m glad that\u2019s not the case. While I do pity Harper and her situation, you are not her father and you have no desire to be. Her real dad needs to step up. NTA", "NTA. You've already gone above and beyond to help a kid, but at this point you're acting as a surrogate husband and father to help your wife's friend. Your wife is placing her friend above you. Assuming you weren't screaming and cursing, it seems like you brought an issue to your wife, explained your very good reasoning, and she continued to prioritize her friend. Being there for her friend's kid is different from raising them.", "Please hear this, OP. I absolutely understand your frustration and I don\u2019t think it is by any means unjustified, so I think you are NTA, but also please consider this: your daughter\u2019s friend is a child. She did not pick her parents (who, by the sounds of it are major AHs), and I absolutely don\u2019t want to tell you what to do in your own life, but I can tell you that your parentage of your daughter\u2019s friend will mean the world to that little girl. Growing up, my parents might as well have been the parents of all of my friends. They would take us all places, offer real advice and real parenting. They were generous, nearly beyond their means for all of my friends, and that has made a massive difference in the lives of me and my friends. My father passed away this last year, and it has been incredibly difficult to be without him, but I am incredibly grateful that he left a legacy of kindness and fatherhood not just with me but with all of my friends who he cared for and loved.\n\nYour generosity and love with that little girl may go unseen with her deadbeat parents, but you are offering a childhood of compassion, friendship, and support for a child who is otherwise without. That said, I know it can be a huge strain, and you have to do what is right for you. Hope you can find a solution that works well for all parties.", "Based on your responses I think you\u2019re a good guy who actually doesn\u2019t mind also caring for Harper within reason. Your point about buying a Mother\u2019s Day present for Harper\u2026 I think your anger might be coming from the unfairness and resentment towards her Dad, you feel like you are being taken advantage of by Harper\u2019s parents and in a way you are, but I don\u2019t think you necessarily need to think of it that way. You probably make that little girl\u2019s Saturday and your daughter (who might get lonely as an only child) by getting to spend so much time with her best friend. My sister was best friends with an only child and she was constantly doing things with their family, even whole vacations, because the parents wanted company for their daughter. \n\nI think it adds a layer of resentment because Harpers Dad sounds like an exceedingly distasteful individual. But I think if you focus on the good feelings related to Harper and not the resentment for her parents, you\u2019d probably feel a lot better about the situation. And make some one on one time with your daughter too, it\u2019s okay to want that and ask for it! If you make it a yes to your daughter rather than a no to Harper your wife should be okay with it.\n\nIn any event, NTA.", "NTA. And I get but good on you and your wife for doing it this long ! You\u2019re making that little girl more happy then you probably know", "NAH. I understand wanting to spend time with just you daughter. But dang do I feel bad for Harper. I really see where your wife is coming from. She wants to help her best friend and the little one.\nAs a child I loved that my friends parents included me in my friends activities. My parents never did such things with me. I'm sure if you knew how much this probably means to Harper you might feel slightly different. But I do understand not wanting to do this every week and getting some quality time with just your daughter.", "Could domestic violence be the real reason that Jennifer and Harper spend the weekends at your house? If he drinks that much, could he be violent? It seems very unusual for a wife and child to spend every weekend away from home.", "Eh\u2026 I\u2019m going to go with NTA. I understand where you are coming from\u2026. But Harper likely has the expectation that weekends are days she spends with her best friend and her best friends dad. She likely treasures those days. Now you aren\u2019t required to this for a kid that isn\u2019t yours, but her dad sounds like a mindless jerk who doesn\u2019t give a crap about any woman in his life.  So with that, you would be very kind to keep her involved and be a positive male role model for her. However, moving forward you could coordinate that Harpers mom and dad to spend some weekends with her, so you and Emma could have quality time together. \n\nAs far as your wife. Her actions are boarder line childish. She shouldn\u2019t lock her self in the guest room because you are trying to set a boundary. It sounds like she enjoys not having to watch the kids and relax with her friend on the weekends while you provide the entertainment for the kids. She needs to break the silence and you both need to hash it out like married couples do. Set boundaries, talk it out, and make plans.", "NTA.  How do you feel about including Harper SOMETIMES (once a month, for example) but not every Saturday?  That way she would get the influence of a decent man to look up to (even though it isn't your job) and you would get more solo time with your daughter.  Maybe offer that?\n\nThe other weekends...well, your wife and Jennifer can take Harper to do things if it's important to them.\n\nThe real AH here is obviously Harper's Dad", "NAH \n\nBut dude this is your daughter\u2019s best friend. This is important to her, too. There\u2019s nothing wrong with scheduling dad-daughter time or family time without Harper ahead of time, so that it\u2019s understood the expectations. But if you just wholesale change everything your daughter isn\u2019t going to be happy and it won\u2019t result in the magical time you\u2019re hoping it will be.", "NTA. Heaven forbid you should want to spend quality time with just your daughter. Your wife is asking a lot. She just kind of took on another child, and volunteered your time, without asking you first", "You\u2019re definitely NTA I think you\u2019re very reasonable but man do I feel awful for that little girl", "NTA\n\nI can't say you're the asshole.  But I can also say that I've done this before and loved every minute of it.  GF had a sister that lived with us with her kids and husband.  Husband was shit.  Aside from sex and romance, I ended up playing the role of husband and dad for those kids, along with mine.  It was not uncommon for me to be dad to 9 kids on any given weekend.  (I'll explain...lol  I have 3 from a prior marriage.  My Gf has 2 from the same.  GF and I have 1 together.  Sister had 3 kids at the time)  Was it absolute chaos?  Fuck yea it was.  But it was awesome.  \n\nYou're not me.  You don't like it, and that's ok too.  Wife does need to understand that you want to be there for your daughter.  Occasional things with Harper are fine, but all the time is a bit much if you don't like it.", "Info are the gift and things you spend on her getting paid back to you?", "INFO: Is jeffiner still married to harper father?", "NTA\n\nYour wife, her bestie and the deadbeat dad are all using you because on Saturday they get to chill without kids since they're BOTH with you.\n\nNext time instead of hiding her guilt in the guest bedroom, your wife and her bestie are going to manipulate the girls into trying to guilt you too.\n\nIf your daughter wants one on one time with you, then your wife, her bestie and Hannah will probably try to make her feel guilty as well.\n\nEither put your foot down or start leaving out with your daughter early before Hannah gets there or after she leaves.", "NTA\n\nMy bestfriends dad(and mom) helped raise me. This post made me feel the feels. Even though I know what that meant to me, it\u2019s still your choice on if you want to be involved with this child. \nThey didn\u2019t have to pay anything for me though. It was more love and communication. Also Dave taught me how to bob and weave. \n\nI hope your wife understands you are your own person and not just an extension of herself that she can make decisions for. I am sure she is disappointed that you don\u2019t feel the same love for her chosen family as she does. She needs to accept that and find ways to cope. Or she can decide that isn\u2019t the person she wants to be married to and her and her bestie can go be platonic life partner\u2019s.", "NTA but please keep doing it anyway.  Someday when Harper grows up and expects men to treat her with respect, it will be because of her association with you.  You're not doing it for Jennifer or for deadbeat dad, you're doing it for a blameless 7 year old who got really lucky that you're in her life.  Having said that, maybe take Emma camping or something-something that will require your wife and her friend to handle Harper and give you some one on one with Emma now and then.  Thanks for what you've done so far-I really hope you find a balance that enables you to be there for this little girl in a way that works for you.", "While you are NTA, I do think you should look at it from harpers perspective\u2026 you could be a positive male influence in her life, sounds like she doesn\u2019t have that. It doesn\u2019t \u2018cost\u2019 you anything other than time you are already spending with your daughter, and could make a huge impact in this kids life.\nI agree her dad should step up, this is unlikely.\n\nETA: I missed you are paying for her classes, that part definitely seems unnecessary- but just hang out time is what I meant \ud83d\ude42", "Info: having you been acting in a fatherly capacity towards Harper for most of her life? Your nta for wanting one on one time with your own child.. but something about being a kids role model and treating them as your own and then abruptly changing the dynamic feels icky to me.", "NAH But you know, just because you step back from doing things with Harper, that doesn't mean the biodad will step up. And you saying he 'needs to step up' is nothing but pissing in the wind. \n\nI get where your wife is coming from. I get where you're coming from. You guys need to find a compromise like 'I will do one thing per weekend with Harper, after that it's me and Emma. I'm not her father. I don't want to be her father. I will help a little but not at the expense of our daughter and myself.'", "NTA but I think you\u2019re a great man for including your daughters best friend the way you are.  You\u2019re showing her what a good dad and husband looks like and that\u2019s admirable. I completely understand wanting alone time with your daughter. Is there a way you would be willing to compromise and do both? Maybe every second weekend or switch up and let the girls spend Saturday together one weekend and Sunday together the next? \n\nIf this little girl stays friends with your daughter, she will most likely grow up calling you a second dad. That\u2019s so sweet. If costs are a factor (which they 100% would be for me), then maybe ask for  funds from the parents for the activities/meals. Your wife needs to be the one asking for that though since it\u2019s her friend right? \n\nYou may be partially raising a kid that\u2019s not yours, but you\u2019re giving your daughter a best friend, a sister, memories to last a lifetime that she otherwise wouldn\u2019t get!! Some people are lucky enough to keep their childhood friends for their whole life and what you\u2019re doing now is laying the groundwork for your daughter to have a lifelong best friend. It might not work out in the end, as friends grow apart, but I think it\u2019s just beautiful for your daughter.  \n\nSounds like your wife needs to be taking both the girls shopping for Father\u2019s Day so they can both pick YOU out a present! \n\nIt also sounds like you and your wife need to have a good talk without either of the girls around. Both of your feelings got hurt and it\u2019s best to be honest and talk things out. No one is in the wrong here. There might be more going on behind the scenes or some guilt (your wife has a better husband than her best friend) since sleeping in a different bedroom for more than one night and the silent treatment is not a healthy or constructive way of dealing with a problem. It\u2019s you and your wife against the problem (you not getting alone time to be a dad to just your daughter/your resentment to the other dad) not you and your wife against each other. \n\nI wish you both all the best!", "NTA.  You have gone above and beyond, and your wife needs to tell her that occasional Saturdays are fine but most weekends you need time with your daughter alone.  Your wife is TA and so is her friend and dead beat husband.", "Info: What does your daughter want?  I  understand your frustration, but you need to find out what your daughter wants.", "How are you \"raising\" her by being a decent human being (although now, I dont really think you are).  \n\nDoes she have a stable dad and home life?  \n\nNope, but hey, you're OK with that it seems.\n\nIf I were your daughter and I found out you were \"put out\" by my friend, whom I loved and cared for - you know what would happen? \n\nResentment.  Shock and disbelief that You, my own dad,  would de-value someone I valued, as \"not worthy of your time and effort\" amd a \"throwaway\" person.\n\nWow, just wow.", "As an parent, it\u2019s your responsibility to do what\u2019s best for your child. Is Emma better off with Harper at her side? Also, you can\u2019t avoid thinking about what\u2019s best for Harper. What do you think she needs in order to be healthy and become an independent adult? Whatever it is, her dad is incapable of providing it. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect him to change. If you withdraw your support, it will affect Hanna, Emma, and Amber. Will you be better off? You need to consider your options carefully. Talk to your wife and try to find a solution that is acceptable to both of you. NAH.", "Wow...Harper probably sees you as a great example of a father to her...until she reads (or hears about) this. \n\nUltimately NTA...but assuming it is in your means this is more of a \"you gained a (surrogate) daughter\" situation. Kind of sad to see you reject that...", "NTA and you should definitely have a talk with this sorry excuse of a father, if anything just to tell him what you think of him", "NAH But what does your daughter want? I was the Harper growing up and I loved my bffs dad, like I think every year I should buy him Father\u2019s Day cards. My bff was an only child so she wanted to always have a friend in a given activity. We are in our 40s and still very close, she is my family. I\u2019m godmother to her children. I share stories about grandpa and mom she we were little. I\u2019m so lucky her Dad let me be a part of their lives.", "NTA. You deserve time with just your family.", "NTA, clearly. If anything you're amazing for doing so much. More so for knowing your limits & how it's affecting your time with your own child. As a compromise, can you cut it down to every other week & explain that you need daddy/daughter time? Maybe invite the deadbeat dad to join those weekends where the other child is coming?\n\n\nGrowing up there were two girls that lived across from me with their grandma. Their mom was in jail & their dad was only there sometimes. He didn't keep a steady job & was clearly on things.\n\nMy parents took those girls with us everywhere from age 8 forward. Church, parks, shopping, the mall, everywhere. They were kinda like siblings except they slept at their own house, didn't have chores & my parents were always nice to them. \n\nAs a child it was fun at first but there came a point (around 13) where I hated it. Even if we weren't getting along, they were invited. They had no rules at their home & bragged about staying out, went with our mutual church friends to concerts & things my parents didn't let me go to, started stealing from the stores when my mom took us shopping, etc. \n\nThey absolutely loved my parents & called them Mom & Dad but were never disciplined or treated like we were. My parents showed preferential treatment. \n\nThey both dropped out of highschool & got pregnant. My parents were very supportive of them. Meanwhile I was top of my class, dancer, nhs, etc but my dad never came to a single event other than graduation. Our relationship was very strained & nothing I did was good enough.\n\nLooking back, I know that what my parents did was a kindness that they needed. I still feel like it was at our expense -my parents had more kids than they could afford without adding those 2.\n\nAs adults we aren't even friends. They aren't family & the few times we've connected & tried to be, they still acted like they were somehow superior. They spoke of \"mom & dad\" like they were saints. It was irritating. \n\n*Your wife might not understand where you're coming from but you can tell her she's welcome to do all the things with that kid if she wants,! You have your priorities straight & I'm glad to see it! Setting the boundaries now will help!", "NTA\n\nAs a child I was forced to spend time with another child on every fun outing. This child was not family. This child was not well behaved. I completely resent the time that I was made to spend with her.", "NTA, but suck it up and keep helping Harper. It sounds like the thing that is gnawing at you isn\u2019t Harper, it\u2019s feeling like that AH is getting over on you. He\u2019s a deadbeat. His opinion doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nOne day you\u2019re going to get a Father\u2019s Day card from her. She\u2019ll be in college or have her first kid, and will recognize what you\u2019re doing now. With any luck, she\u2019ll have seen a good male role model and won\u2019t make the same mistake her mom did. \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility, but it is in your power.", "INFO: seems like a big leap, having that conversation calmly to your wife sleeping in another room. Is something missing from the story? Otherwise, an easy N T A.", "NTA however, you need to consider Harper and Emma\u2019s friendship will be affected by you leaving Harper out.", "NTA sir, not the asshole at all. Your points are extremely valid! Also why is Jennifer paying for nothing towards her child and why is she with someone who not only doesn't care about her but also doesn't care about his daughter?\n\nYour wife is wrong in this case and when you do fun things with your daughter you don't have to take her friend Harper with as well. Harper's mother can plan a fun day for HER daughter.", "Info\n\nDoes Emma want her around? That would be the most important deciding factor here for me.", "NTA, you shouldn't be expected to fill the gap left by a deadbeat dad. I feel bad for Jennifer and Harper both.\n\nBut honestly, look at the behaviour you're modelling for your daughter and her friend: You are showing them both how a supportive partner and father should behave. You're demonstrating to them both that fathers should be there for their children, and husbands should be there for their partners in their lives. You're doing an amazing job, and I hope you are appreciated for the support you've offered to your daughter, her friend, your wife, and her friend. You taught someone else's daughter how to ride a bike? Man... that's impressive, kudos to you for stepping up.\n\nI think if you change your perspective a bit, it will feel less like a chore and more like something that is strengthening your relationships with your wife and your daughter. That doesn't mean you should be expected to bring Harper along every Saturday, but when you do so it will definitely make a positive impact on your daughter's memory of you and the expectations she has of a partner later in her life.", "NTA. so when does your wife spend time with you? It sounds like all of her weekends are spent with Jennifer. What if you say you want family time on the weekends, just the three of you, in order to strengthen your family bonds?\n\nShe is definitely being an AH for her reaction to you not wanting to raise another man's child.", "NTA but also Harper is the victim here. \n\nIt would be martyrish for you to be her father figure.", "This is a difficult situation because your daughter likes having Harper there.  But, you deserve some alone time with your daughter.  So maybe start small.  Talk to your wife and Emma alone and say that starting with xx Saturday, once per month you and Emma will spend a Saturday alone.  You and your wife then need to explain this to Jennifer and Harper, making sure that Harper knows that this is not about her and that you enjoy spending time with her also (even if it isn't true, she is a child and she needs to believe this - especially with the horrible dad she has).   Make your plans with Emma for your day alone and enjoy it.  Then you can decide if you need to make more time, and ease Emma into the new routine.", "NTA. I was going to say NAH, because I totally get where your wife is coming from, but the way she reacted is overboard unless there's something you're not being honest with us about.", "ESH, because it sounds like this kid doesn't actually cause any problem for you, besides the fact that you feel that you \"shouldn't have to\" deal with her.  If you wanted more time with just your daughter, although you say she's perfectly happy to have her friend always along, you could have communicated that in a much better way. On the other hand, not speaking to you isn't good behavior, either. \n\nI think you should come back to your wife and talk about what both of you value and want or of this situation. And also think of the potential you have to do good for someone who doesn't have a stable father figure. You can come up with a balance that is good for everyone.", "Ok, so NTA because I get it. This sounds frustrating as hell. But maybe you reframe how you are looking at this. You are giving both your wife and your daughter a pretty big gift through your actions here. Your wife probably really wants time off where she can spend time with her friend. And your daughter probably loves getting to spend time with both you and her best friend. Chances are she views this as a super amazing time, and she probably cherishes the fact that her dad wants to spend time playing with her and her friend. So you are being amazing in two ways. But clearly it is interfering with bonding time you want strictly with your daughter. And that makes sense.\n\nMaybe each Saturday morning you ask your daughter if she wants to bring her friend or if she wants a day of just the two of you, and then you let your wife know your plan because you are choosing to let the daughter you want to bond with make choices for herself. You could even frame it as a choice between two different activities if you want to make whatever it is she does with you a more alluring choice. But then you are actively making plans and not just taking what the weekend hands you, you know? If it is a day out with her friend, let your wife know when you are dropping the friend off because you are going to pivot to some daddy/daughter time so give her and Harper\u2019s mother basically a non-negotiable end time to your babysitting. Maybe plan to go to the zoo, but then you guys are coming back to drop off Harper so the two of you \u2014 or maybe even the three of you, since there is also a wonderful opportunity to bond as a family unit \u2014 are going out for dinner. You need to both make room for your daughter\u2019s wants and needs but also use common sense to build out time for yourself. Why the heck didn\u2019t you say \u201cyes, but we\u2019ll just drop Harper off with her mum before we go shop for Mother\u2019s Day\u201d for instance?\n\nThe fact that Harper\u2019s dad is a deadbeat sucks, but you have a chance to be a pretty spectacular dad and husband here. And you have a chance to change how this all shakes out every weekend, but you need to communicate with your wife and daughter.

You\u2019re not an AH for wanting to spend alone time with your own daughter and for not wanting to pay for or take care of someone else\u2019s. However, your wife\u2019s reaction makes me think you didn\u2019t express your point very eloquently so maybe you\u2019re the AH for that.\n\nEither way, you need to be more communicative about what you want and need from this situation. It is reasonable to not want to buy gifts for others but the parents didn\u2019t expect you to do that. The girls asked you to. It also seems that your girls are best friends and that\u2019s probably how you ended up taking on both of them. If you decide that you and Emma should get two weekends a month alone, that\u2019s that. And I think that you should consider being more mindful of when you take Harper. Since you now know that she\u2019ll want you to buy a present for her mom, maybe ask that that be a day for you and Emma.\n\nA little communication goes a long way.

Your wife has to HER OWN family first.", "NTA - You\u2019re obviously not the asshole here, but I\u2019d challenge you to think this through a little more.  What you\u2019re doing for this little girl could very well be life changing for her.  Kids need engaged male role models.  Also, engaged non-parent adults have a material impact on the academic success of kids.  \n\nI think what you\u2019re doing is wonderful.  Her Dad isn\u2019t going to change.

It's okay to want to spend time with your own family and not parent someone else's child.\n\nOn the other hand, you are likely the only father figure  Harper may have, unless her mother leaves deadbeat. You are modelling a generous and attentive father, and being a good role model to her. Harper *needs* that, and while I understand that you are at the end of your patience with her inept parents, I just wanted to let you know that I commend you for stepping up when her father hasn't.\n\nMaybe if you speak to Jennifer and tell her that you're not going to make up the shortfall anymore, or even speak directly to deadbeat, they might change and try and be more attentive parents, but that probably won't happen.\n\nIts a hard situation to navigate.", "NTA. Just want to start off with saying what you are doing is amazing.

She cannot tell you how to spend time with your daughter.", "NTA, and bad cess to Harper's father.  OP, your frustration is valid, but *tone and approach* man.  First, figure out what is it that is really bothering you.  Is it the expenditure of money, or of time?  Sounds like mostly the latter, so...  approach wife with this angle, that you need some actual 1-1 time with Emma.  Figure out what kind of schedule for Harper coming over is more reasonable, so you get time with daughter, and she still gets time with her friend.  Let's not overlook the child's interests here.\n\nAnother thought...  daily time and boring daily life has a more powerful impact on a child than weekly \"dad-onslaughts\".  You might consider how to work your schedule so that you get as much possible daily routine involvement with the daughter.  Be the guy who tucks her in -- or brings her back to bed when she escapes.  Be the guy who packs her lunch -- and put little notes in the lunchbox.  See where I'm going here?", "Esh", "Wow, if you gotta raise her friend's kid, at the very least, she should put out for your efforts. The friend, not the wife. While I am joking, it almost seems like you have two wives. If you can't reason with your wife, then come on saturday, take your daughter alone and go out, and leave Harper behind and say it's daddy/daughter day. Maybe they will take the hint.", "YTA. Your response to a kid who is abandoned by her dad is \u2026 resentment? It isn\u2019t her fault. You have a chance to be a positive force in the life of a kid. I don\u2019t get it. Yes, her dad should do more. So man up and tell him. If no one sticks up for kids who are left behind by their parents, they\u2019re gonna have a hard time in life.

Not sure why you\u2019re so mad tbh.. If it\u2019s at the Dad, take it up with him. Like YO! Take your daughter out on Saturdays, so I can do mine 1:1. Otherwise, use your words better. Tell your wife, \u2018I\u2019m happy to do every other Saturday where we include Harper, but not every single like it\u2019s become.\u2019 That\u2019s reasonable.

But let\u2019s think down the road a bit. I highly doubt you\u2019ll regret being such a kind man to the other little girl, the influence you have in her is way better than she\u2019s getting anywhere else, especially from her dad. Now my idea would be to say hey Emma and I have plans on (blank) it\u2019s a solo day for use you will just have to entertain Harper on your own and set aside a Saturday or two to spend 1on1 with your little girl.\nAlso Harper will remember you being such a kind man to her your her father figure. Try to look at it with a better view \nNTA at all", "Going against the grain here. YTA.\nBut so is her dad.

You aren't an asshole for being frustrated and tired of raising someone else's kid, you're an asshole for not recognizing the positive impact you're having on that kid's life.  It's probably also worth pointing out your life might **still** be like this even if she had a great dad; kids are pack animals, there's a very real chance one of them would always be with the other one regardless.\n\nHarper is innocent here, she didn't do anything wrong.  When she grows up, she's going to have a glowing opinion of her friend's dad that was there for her when her own dad wasn't.

It\u2019s weird how you expect your wife to stand up and make the effort to contact the other family when you were just as capable of doing it yourself.

Absolutely.  But that is someone who's gone *above and beyond* for a child that isn't theirs. Your wife needs to acknowledge that what's been happening is above and beyond. \n\nBut! 7 years in,  you've set the expectation and Harper is NOT going to understand your withdrawing. So hmm.... for taking 7 years to decide this was an issue.\n\nWhy don't you PLAN father daughter days WELL in advance with the statement that it is strictly you two only and the moms will need to find something for Harper to do those days.\n\nEdit: after OPs response and reconsidering the wording, I'm going to change to NTA. Is it crappy to Harper, who won't understand,  yeah. But OPs question is was it AH to say that to his wife and the answer is No, because you're entitled to your feelings.  If you feel that way, you feel that way. I think that OP has more options than he's considered without making it a fight with his wife though.", "NAH. It sounds like you need to have a conversation with Jennifer about how this is affecting things. Maybe there\u2019s underlying issues as to why Jennifer  and Harper are always at your place. If Jennifer\u2019s husband is always drinking and refusing to do anything regarding his daughter, then there\u2019s nothing you can do to make him do anything. \n\nRealistically, the one true outcome out of this is Harper not understanding why you\u2019re no longer hanging out with her. And by no means are you obligated to do anything for Harper. You\u2019re right, you\u2019re not her father but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t have a father anyways.", "YTA, but gently. Harper has a deadbeat dad, and no matter how much you think he needs to step up, he won\u2019t. He should be doing all the things you do, but he will never. \n\nBut do you know what Emma and Harper have right now? They have a role model father.

He is the type of guy that brags about how he never changed a diaper. \n\nJennifer and Harper are usually at Amber and my house  on the weekends because Harper\u2019s dad is drinking and watching sports all weekend. On Saturdays I normally sped all day with my daughter because I don\u2019t see her as much as i want to during the week. However with Harper being there every Saturday  anything I do with Emma I have to do with Harper. Take Emma to the zoo it\u2019s Emma, Harper and I. Taught them both how to ride bikes, takes them both to dance class, take them both to the kids salon, and so on.  \n\nMother\u2019s Day was the last draw, I took them both to dance class Saturday morning ( Amber and I also pay for both dance classes because dead beet won\u2019t)  on the way home Emma asked if we could stop to get something for mom for Mother\u2019s Day, I said sure but then it ended up I had to buy something for Harper to her her mom as well. On the way home I just kept thinking why am I buying someone else\u2019s wife a Mother\u2019s Day gift, that\u2019s his job.\n\nA few days later (because I did not want to ruin Mother\u2019s Day) I told my wife that I am tired of raising Harper, her real father needs to step up. I tired of it taking away time I get to spend with Emma.

You are stepping up where Harpers father isn\u2019t.

She\u2019s young now, but if you keep being there for her, as she gets older she\u2019ll realize what man stood by her and shaped her. She\u2019ll bring value to your life as well.

He's not getting one over on you. You're manning up and showing his daughter what a healthy relationship. What a healthy father figure looks like. \nIt's hard when it splits time with your own kid and a good way to set boundaries there is to have some scheduled (well in advance) 1 on 1 time with your daughter. Make it about time with her not time without her friend. \n\nI urge you so strongly to show up for the other little girl though, if she's friends with your daughter long-term you might save them both from abusive boyfriends, drugs, or a host or other potential problems.", "Nta.

You need to have a \"Come to Jesus\" conversation with your wife.\n\nAnd frankly, the discussion should be about a bigger topic than having to take Harper everywhere with you and Emma on weekends. Or about having to pay for stuff for Harper that her dad will never agree to pay for.\n\nWhat you need to confront them on is the fact that the poor state of Jennifer's marriage, and your wife's overriding desire to help her friend is now beginning to interfere with your own marriage.\n\nYou have legitimate concerns, both that the situation is interfering with your ability to spend 1:1 time with Emma, and that you are being placed as an involuntary father figure for Harper.\n\nYour wife's response to hearing those concerns should have been to listen to you, discuss what your concerns are and try to come up with ways to rectify the situation. (Which, yes, probably will mean doing less for and with Jennifer and Harper on weekends.)\n\nBut that's not what happened here. What she did was made a declaration that boils down to her friend and her friend's child being more important than the needs of her husband and her daughter in this area. And then followed it by the silent treatment and her moving to the guest room.\n\nAs soon as she did that, this became an issue about your marriage. About the fact that she *is* placing a relationship with her friend above her relationship with you. I am not saying that she shouldn't support her friend.

If a better balance is not found, her need to support her friend could become a huge problem in your marriage.\n\nside-note: when you can get to re-addressing the need to be able to spend 1:1 time with Emma, here is an aspect to call out. Emma may love getting to spend lots of time with Harper... **now**. That does not mean that she will always feel this way. As she moves towards the tweens and teens, she could easily start to become resentful that she can never go anywhere with just dad... or just mom. That Harper or Harper and Jennifer are always around. This could become especially problematic when one or both of them start developing friendships separate from any they mutually share.\n\nLearning and finding a better balance would be helpful for all 5 of you.", "NTA. During my childhood, I had a friend whose dad was not in her life. She spent a lot of time at our house, and she always got on well with my dad. He treated her like family & she often went to him for advice. He\u2019s a really, really great dad. If she asked for help, I\u2019m sure he would always say yes. But it was also important for my dad & I to have our own relationship, and we do. He will also catch up with her when I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m not envious of that because I always knew that my own relationship with him was special & valued. \n\nWhilst it\u2019s lovely that you do those things with Harper, it shouldn\u2019t be at the detriment to your relationship with Emma. There will likely come a time where they feel competitive for your attention. It sounds like they interact like siblings, and that\u2019s just a natural part of the sibling relationship. That\u2019s not fair to Emma, and eventually it will lead to Harper feeling like another man doesn\u2019t want her. That\u2019s not a healthy pattern. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for you to want a relationship with Harper that is independent of others. You sound like a good dad, but also a good person. What you\u2019ve been for both Harper & Jennifer is really lovely. But it isn\u2019t your responsibility, and it shouldn\u2019t be. At some point, Jennifer needs to hold her husband accountable for his shitty parenting & stop expecting you to fill that role in their lives.

I don\u2019t understand why Harpers mom isn\u2019t at least driving kids to dance since you pay it etc?", "I think it\u2019s NAH except for the deadbeat dad. \n\nI just feel so bad about the kid\u2026 I\u2019d probably tell the wife\u2019s friend to make plans outside of coming to your house 2-3 weekends a month so you can get 1-1 time with your daughter. Not my place to say what you should do about the other kid but you are a father figure for her at this point and I don\u2019t think you should completely abandon her.", "Yes - maybe you could compromise and take her some of the time but not every time.", "NTA - it sounds like you just need to set some boundaries though on spending one on one time with Emma, instead of framing it that you don\u2019t want to be there for Harper. Your wife clearly cares for both her friend and her daughter so forcing her to not be there for them because you don\u2019t like it isn\u2019t a battle you should be having (and I\u2019ve phrased it like that because your wife cares for these people and that will be her perspective). Instead tell your wife you miss spending time with your daughter, and that on x day that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to do. What they do with Harper is then their decision. You\u2019re not leaving her out, you\u2019re prioritising the relationship with your daughter. \n\nIt\u2019d be the same if she was your daughter, you\u2019d still need one-on-one with each child. It\u2019s important as they\u2019re individuals.", "Just start taking Emma. If your wife pushes back, tell her that you and Emma need father daughter time.

Just the two of you, no mom, no friends, etc. That way you\u2019re not specifically excluding Harper, but you still get one on one time. It doesn\u2019t have to be the full day either, but it gives you a way to set a cut off. \u201cYou can play with Harper after we get back from breakfast\u201d or \u201cHarper can come over but you and I are gonna leave around noon for our one on one time\u201d. \n\nAs someone with a deadbeat dad myself (single mom though), I did spend a bit of time with my best friend\u2019s family. Not to this extent, and we would switch, so my mom had all the kids a decent chunk of the time. All that to say, my friend\u2019s dad is this only person who did \u201cdad\u201d things, and he set the expectation for how I want my fianc\u00e9 to be with our future kids. \n\nHarper will absolutely remember you as a dad figure, and likely as a \u201cgood\u201d dad figure. Nothing you want (alone time with your kid) is unreasonable. I\u2019d just urge you to be intentional with how you do it, as in keeping the focus on 1:1 time, rather than coming off as explicitly excluding Harper.", "Why do you pay for her dance classes? Why can\u2019t either of Harper\u2019s parents do it? \n\nI would tell your wife you all have to talk together. It sucks for Harper, hopefully she won\u2019t see this as another man who doesn\u2019t want to be around her, but that is not really your fault. Jennifer chose her parent for her child, she isn\u2019t holding him accountable, and she should be figuring this out. I would still take the girls out together sometimes, if they\u2019re friends they might like doing things together, but not every single time. That\u2019s a lot.", "NTA. Taking over the responsibilities of a dead beet is cucumbersome.", "Unless they have stayed over, try getting your daughter up very early before they arrive, go to breakfast together, and spend the day out. \n\nI do want to add that you should be able to have time alone with your daughter without this other child tagging along. That said, your influence on this other child now may have a profound effect on her as an adult. You are giving her normal experiences with a father figure that will help shape her future relationships in a healthy way. You know that \u201cIt takes a village to raise a child\u201d saying? Right now you and your family are the village.", "At first I thought this was just a weekend occurrence, but you indicate that Emma and Mom are at your house every day.  This is just taking advantage IMO.  Don't these two have errands and their own life to lead?  Since they are at your house five days a week, I don't think its unreasonable for you to request that weekends be for your family solely.  Sorry the Dad is drinking, but the Mom and Emma need to find other activities that either take them away from that situation.  They live in a house and the Dad is not following them around drinking I would assume.  They can also go to the library, park, other friends/relatives - it doesn't have to be 100% at your house.", "In my opinion she\u2019s not a real good mother to Emma, because she is making decisions that is taking Emma away from her one on one time with you, her dad.

Either way, she's with her daughter and I imagine that staying with your wife will be the more appealing option.\n\nIf you're paying for dance classes for them both every Saturday already it's not like she doesn't get time off of parenting, you're just holding her accountable on the Sunday when you want to spend quality father daughter time.", "What do you mean? Is there something with you and Jennifer?", "Then tell her mother Jennifer in advance and if she does nothing on the weekend In front of Harper you unfortunately can't take Harper with you and tell Harper her mommy will spend time with her and leave with your daughter only.\n\n After you do this a few times they ll learn ( assuming your wife and Jennifer  have working neurons in their head and actually care about hurting Harper that is).\n\nNTA", "OP can still support the kid without *literally* every event being two person.

The reality is that the kid probably gets a lot from OP as a father figure and personally I could never have the heart to end that. My husband and I are definitely the open house to any friends that need it type of people. But that\u2019s just us, I was that kid that basically moved out at 16 and lived with other friends and I\u2019ll always be grateful for that.", "Yeah this is a kid that's looking for a father because her home life is atrocious and, likely, abusive.  It sucks that it's on OP to deal with this situation and it's not really required of him to do it, but I'd have a hard time _not_ being there for the kid.\n\nYou can definitely still set boundaries like not buying a mother's day card for the kid and all that too (encourage the kid to go home and _make_ one instead).", "Me too!", "I feel so bad for Harper she is getting rejected by another father figure basically, I understand it\u2019s not OPs responsibility technically, but like where is the empathy idk??

You don't want both of the other people in your household seeing you as the jerk that was mean to their best friend. Unfortunately y'all have established the Saturday Dad takes the best friends to dance class thing as a routine. If you suggest excluding Harper Emma might be pretty upset.", "Isnt this something that should be included in the post? If your daughter wants her best friend there, that changes things. \n\nI see a lot of comment of people completely making out like the other kid is an unwanted burden your wife forces on the family. It seems everyone is happy with the situation but you. There has to be some kind of compromise that makes YOU happy too. And that means some one-on-one time with your daughter alone\u2026.but not completely cutting the other girl off.", "I was wondering this as well. Have you asked what she would prefer? Maybe she knows about the situation and is in fact grateful you help out, and taking that away for \"father-daughter time\" might lead to a conflict. Or maybe she has more complex feelings about the whole situation, secretly feeling replaced. Who knows.\n\nYou need to talk to your daughter to understand her side as well. You have a lot of emotions that are very valid, so you really need to talk this through with everyone involved and find a compromise.\n\nReally tough situation overall.\n\nNAH (except deadbeat dad)", "So stop taking Harper, if they ask you to  say \"No, I am spending quality 1-1 time with my daughter.\"", "Why is having Harper along a problem? I've been the Emma in this situation (except* my \"Harper\" also had an absent mom) and never felt like having my friend along was diminishing dad time.

Picnic. Roller skating. Zoo. Whatever. But just for your family. Seems like there needs to be a readjustment of what normal is.", "I mean, you're doing her a huge  favor, which I'm sure she will always appreciate.I don't think he father will ever step up....  Maybe just talk to your wife to arrange for them to go do something on some Saturdays  so you and your daughter  can spend quality time alone? Other then that I don't see what else to do since your wife feels pretty strongly about it.", "Then definitely NTA you\u2019re being generous with not only your time but also money. Obviously the other dad is a raging asshole but I\u2019d put Jennifer in the asshole camp as well tbh because there is no way I\u2019d ever put another family in a situation to spend money like that on my kid as a normal expectation. She\u2019s either wildly oblivious or extremely inconsiderate", "Say it\u2019s a Daddy Daughter Date, just for the two of you.  Talk to her about how it\u2019s important you two have 1:1 time. \nAlso, it\u2019s great to have friends and even a BFF but your daughter needs time away from Harper. Everyone needs to be able to manage life independently. Even if she\u2019s too young to understand that. Being so emeshed with someone isn\u2019t good for her social development.", "That you want to spend time with just her because you don\u2019t get to see her that much during the week and you miss her? \n\nYou don\u2019t have to cut Harper out completely, just basically tell your wife you\u2019d like at least every other weekend to take just your daughter out after dance class. If Emma gets upset you could decide just one weekend for sure every month can just be you two. Cause the point is to have fun and get to bond with your daughter not make her upset. And once you break the cycle of EVERY Saturday then it will hopefully become a non-issue", "Emma should be old enough that you can have a conversation with her about this and your desire to spend one-on-one time with her.", "It sounds like he may be abusive, in which case it'd be helpful to help your wife's friend to leave him-and kind of more understandable that they're constantly at your place. If it's because he abuses them when they're there it's a safety issue, as opposed to him just being uninvolved in the kid's life and stingy where they can 'tough it out' for a day a week for sure. \n\nOf course it's still okay to have boundaries and to want time for your family, but this seems to be really difficult and a time for a really thorough conversation before making any hard-set demands.", "So maybe when you plan a daddy daughter day, don't say what you're going to go do.  Say you haven't quite decided yet.  That way you're not saying we're going to go do X and Harper gets excited/jealous that she wants to go do. I think it's reasonable to ask your wife for this time,  but maybe make it a consistent thing.  For example, Saturday mornings dad and Emma go out.  Get out of the house before they can come over.", "i don't think you're an AH  by any means, but i feel sorry for that little girl.

He could have gently told Harper, Your daddy is going to get a card for your mommy with you so I'm not going to have you pick one out with Emma.

He just doesn't want to be the bad guy.", "They need to have a conversation about it. \"I'm tired of raising a kid that isn't mine\" might not have been the most productive conversation starter.", "Yeah, it's not fair, it's a sucky situation. That's why I said it was a soft YTA. Basically just that after creating the norm for this neglected kid it'd be cruel to take it away from her. I suppose maybe ESH would have been a more accurate judgement tho thinking more on it, but basically I think the kids should be prioritized either way.", "For not being his business he sure mentioned it a lot.", "Our house is on the way to Dance, so she comes here first.

Between age 13-16, I would spend practically every weekend at my BFF's house. My parents were divorced, and her parents were awesome and still married. They showed me a dynamic that didn't exist in my family unit. They never acted like I was a burden. I didn't spend EVERY single weekend- sometimes, my friend would tell me she was doing something with her parents, and I couldn't come over (that made me a little sad).

No, that's simply not how being a parent works.

This is why I think Jennifer is taking advantage of your family\u2019s generosity and has superglued herself to your home. Jennifer would not even have to mention her home life to someone else to have a casual meeting with let\u2019s say 4 people once a month, so that she\u2019s not over at your house all the time. \n\nAt Harper\u2019s age, kids in my area pretty much have a birthday party every week since it\u2019s customary to invite everyone (even random kids your kids don\u2019t know). It\u2019s not a stretch to think there could be 1 event or playdate for Harper. It\u2019s also the parent\u2019s role at that age to set up playdates for kids, and I don\u2019t think Jennifer is trying. \n\nI can also see an argument made that it would be better for both Emma and Harper to have a greater diversity of friends than just one another. Does Emma only interact with Harper?\n\nLastly, even despite all of the above, Jennifer could take Harper to the mall, the park, or some other place to spend the day without anyone else.

I understand you'd rather have dad-daughter time and you certainly should, but you probably really need to be careful to continue to include Harper a lot of the time.

Jennifer doesn't have to require anything of her husband when you are fulfilling the father role every weekend.\n\nConversely, dad is not feeling any pressure to put down the bottle and start acting like a proper parent.\n\nShe's allowing this for several reasons. The first is that Jennifer no doubt finds it easier to just let sleeping dogs lie. Why rock the boat with her husband and expect him to step up if she doesn't have to? AND she clearly doesn't have to because you are fathering her child every weekend right along with your own, so it's not like Harper's really missing a father. In fact she's double dipping in the father category.\n\nJennifer likely needs a break from her kid and you're the only one offering to take her out and do things with her.

He is clearly an important part of Harper\u2019s life, providing both financial and emotional support. \n\nIf he retreats, will he be happier in the long run or will he regret it? Will he look back and understand that he did the best he could? As I said, he needs to talk to his wife about the problem. He will be more at peace with himself if the two of them can reach an agreement.", "I think something else to consider is at this point, OP\u2019s daughter probably views her friend as more like a sister if they\u2019re best friends who spend all this time together at her house and going to activities and doing bonding activities and hanging with OP and his wife. \n\nObviously even with birthed children, you should have 1-1 time with them but if OP starts cutting out the best friend from stuff, OP\u2019s daughter is probably going to be hurt and confused by it too.", "That's why I think this is bad for OPs marriage.

If op's daughter wants her best friend to come over all the time to hang out and go places, I think it's wrong for dad to all the sudden say they can't spend as much time together. Also, I have a hunch. There's a reason op's wife's best friend is letting this happen so much. Maybe the home environment with the dad is not a good place to be for the child, but she feels trapped. And op's wife wants to help her best friend and her daughter.

Why is he being asked to do more than his share of the work because some other dude wants to sit on his ass and watch TV all weekend?", "I think that's possible, but also giving her more grace I also really think it's possible here that OP's wife started out helping her friend and has just fallen into a co-parent role over time to the point where she really now feels an adopted parent amount of love and attachment for Harper, which is why she's now reacting so strongly. However, if that's the case she's still the AH for defacto adopting a child without communicating with her partner about it and shutting down communication about it now. (Harper's parents also, her dad for obvious reasons and her mum for... sort of the same as OP's wife - setting up this dynamic without honest and explicit communication that she was seeking a new co-parent in place of her husband).

That\u2019s a wonderful value to instill in children. Still, 1 on 1 time between parent and child is important, so I think OP\u2019s wish is valid.

Your dynamic isn\u2019t applicable here. It will feel like abandonment/rejection rather than waiting her turn.", "He doesn't want her there. I can't imagine that's particularly good for her.

A ton of kids are just roaming around with no safety, no direction, nothing good at all. It\u2019s become our normal- so, to me, OP\u2019s issue is easy. But, again, it would be my decision and it\u2019s not the right decision for everyone. OP doesn\u2019t seem to be in the right headspace to take on the emotional caring for another kid. That\u2019s ok.", "I was wondering the same thing, too. Is Jennifer and the wife just sitting at home drinking wine while OP takes the girls? Or are they taking care of things that need taking care of? The latter I could understand since kids can be disruptive ( though every weekend???). The former would be just wholly unfair to OP.", "Came here to say this. On Saturdays, you can take just Emma out and Jennifer should spend some 1:1 time with her own kid because even though there's several mentions of the dead \"beet\" dad, it doesn't sound like Jennifer spends any kind of alone time with her own kid.", "Take my imaginary award. (Award)", "Also why is he paying for dance class? If her dad won\u2019t, it should fall on her mom not you.

To develop their own traditions and shared experiences while she is still young -- whether it is fishing, or going out every Sunday morning for a banana sundae, or playing Monopoly every Saturday evening, or having a picnic for two every Saturday morning, or camping every month.\n\nHarper is denying OP and his daughter from time together, and it is time that will never be recovered -- children grow up so quickly. The fact that OP's daughter is happy with the current arrangement because she gets to hang out with her best friend does not make it right. [How many of you are still in touch with your childhood best friend? Wouldn't matter anyway; as a father, he has a right to spend precious one-on-one time with his daughter.]\n\nOP is NTA. \n\nThe fact that OP's wife is trying to manipulate him by withholding contact and affection is not fair to OP and their daughter. OP's wife is prioritizing Harper's needs over OP's and their daughter's needs. \n\nIt's very toxic of OP's wife to resort to such tactics.", "There is no reason to explain to the kid that they aren't including the friend.\n\n\"We're going to go do some daddy-daughter time!\"\n\nDon't even mention the friend.\n\nDad goes and gets his nails done with a buff and manicure, and his daughter gets a nail polish color with hers. Go for ice cream. You and I are going to the movies, the zoo. You and I are going for a hot chocolate at the cafe.\n\nThere's no reason to even mention the friend not being invited. If the kid asks... 'she's spending time with her mom today.' It's not that OP and wife discussed one on one time without the other girl. It's that Harper is with her mother. Simple.", "That is what I think too. There needs to be a sit down with the 3 adults (because the deadbeat isn't in the picture really) and a schedule needs to be made, an agreement on spending/reimbursement, and an HONEST conversation about the home life of Harper. And I mean her mom and dad's house, no OP's. If the other dad is abusive they might need help leaving but you can't just have your friend harbor you for eternity while your husband wastes your resources. Right now she doesn't have to leave him because they have a backup family. This is such a complicated issue and the only path forward is communication.", "Yeah, you're right. I didn't think about that part.", "He may see the difference in the way they interact with just them versus the friend, too.\n\nEven a weekend a month with just them may be enough to give him the relationship he wants to build with his child.\n\nIt's not an unreasonable request to want to have a bond with your very young child.", "Because he wants to spend time with his kid without her friend?", "Majority will be happy of having a friend over from time to time, but having a friend over every single quality time is essentially adopting her. Fun for the kid, but it's pretty exhausing for the parent who isn't committed. \n\nIt puts them in a weird limbo because what he considers private family time is different from his wife and daughter's private time.

It also translates well to German as \"tote Bete\".", "This is a good advice, as you will see what works best. As a mother of four I found it surprisingly tiresome to be with just one kid for a whole day.

This isn\u2019t the long term solution though.", "Yes, Harper's mom needs to use her words. Not OP. OP will be using his words with his wife and Harper's mom.", "> But then that is neglecting Emma, who sees Harper as a best friend/basically a sibling.\n\nDoes she?

There are alarms sounding for a lot of people here.", "Do you suspect there's DV going on in Harper's home?

Hence why I think asking Emma is good - get to the bottom how she feels about the constant outings together and go from there. If Emma REALLY likes that Harper is there, then maybe they could compromise at like once a month when Harper joins them too? Or he doesn\u2019t have to either because a parent is entitled to and even should get to spend time with their children alone as well - that\u2019s how you create good bonding memories and show your kid that you want to actually spend time in their company without anybody else there.", "Harper is lucky to have him in her life!", "I agree, but if Emma is going to be given a vote then Emma needs to be given a vote.

Or his friend is an EMT that's friends with a cop. \n\nThis is bad. \n\nNow the whole PD knows where the DV shelter is, and they're who we try to keep them from knowing MOST, because it's statistically likely their spouses and children need to escape there. \n\nShelters lose a lot of money when they have to relocate, and they often TRY to relocate when an abuser shows up so everyone can feel safer long term. \n\nBeing a DV activist is HARD, because you can't trust a majority of helpful people, just because they're not quiet enough about the right things.", "That and buying Mother\u2019s Day gifts etc seems like a lot.

It's a delicate situation though and I feel for Harper.\nI suppose one point I might add is that your daughter and Harper are very good friends right now. But, as they grow older they may drift apart. This could happen when they transition to bigger school, or they might just find themselves to be into different things when they're teenagers. I remember I had a close friend up until about aged 7, then another close friend until aged 12ish. There was no falling out in either of the two cases, it was just school transitions and life changes in the home that made us not as close on both counts. We did still attend the same school but the social circles widened the bigger the school got. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that if Harper comes to depend on your family for all her emotional support, it would be extremely difficult for her if a time should come where her and your daughter are no longer as close. Therefore, I think it's sensible to try and have a few days where Harper is not so embedded into your family's life. Given her circumstances I think it's important that she maintains contact and outings with you and your family, just not all of the time. There will be a point where she needs to be OK with being independent and with just her mother. \n\nThey won't be wrapped around each other forever and I think it's commendable that you have played such a lovely role in Harper's life so far.

My bff, who I was inseparable with, had a dad that went off the rails psycho when her mom asked for a divorce.

I could go into it, but I'd rather keep the focus on OP. In sum, boundaries are important to protect your family's bonds and resources (time, money or otherwise) because your family comes first. I'm not saying that you should never help out friends or people in bad situations. I'm not saying OP's family should cut ties with Harper and Jennifer. But to have a reasonable boundary like wanting to spend one on one time with your daughter pushed back against is at least a yellow flag. Dads should want and be able to spend quality time with their daughters. Emma and Harper can hang out the rest of the weekend or during week days. NTA to dad for establishing those boundaries early on...

Also, having your kid's best friend over often means less work because they entertain each other. However, it is fair to say that you want a day without company or a day with only your daughter (I do that with each of my own children regularly).", "Strongly agree. But also, having to pay for a bunch of things for Harper is a bit far. Emma\u2019s preferences matter, and if she rly does want Harper to be there, it\u2019s unfair to just disregard her preferences and force the on-on-one time. That being said, OP should not be expected to pay for the stuff Harper\u2019s dad refuses to pay for. It\u2019s unfortunate that her dad won\u2019t and her mom can\u2019t afford it, but it\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to cover that, and I think that\u2019s something that rly needs to be addressed as well. That may also be partly where the \u201craising Harper\u201d thing comes from, if it feels like OP is investing more money in Harper than her parents are (obviously I don\u2019t know the full situation though, so I could be completely off with that).", "Even if they are really close there should be boundaries.

I loved that parents allowed her to be part of our family and it is still one of the things I appreciate most about them. \n\nA thing to keep in mind \u2014 and again, this is unfortunate but also reality \u2014  is that if you exclude Harper, you\u2019re probably not going to have a great, fun, daughter-daddy day with Emma.

It\u2019s one of two where you\u2019ve given any context at all about Jennifer\u2019s husband.\n\nMy first thought was this is a marriage issue, not between you and your wife, but Jennifer and her husband. There\u2019s issues there that she\u2019s ignoring because you and your wife are stepping in for Harper. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to find the right way to phrase this, but I think this needs to be a conversation between you and your wife about Jennifer and her marriage.

I.e. \u201cthe more I thought about Harper the more concerned I am about her home life. I\u2019m really glad that we can be here for Jennifer and Harper, but what\u2019s happening when they\u2019re home alone? Is it really healthy for Harper to see her dad treat her and her mother so poorly? Is there a reason Jennifer is still with him? Could we be doing something to help get her out of her situation and marriage to make her and Harper\u2019s life better?\u201d \n\nBasically my line in the sand would be I\u2019ll keep taking care of Harper sometimes, but Jennifer needs to leave the deadbeat. If she leaves him and y\u2019all help with lawyers a TEMPORARY place to say etc, but that should eventually set Jennifer and Harper up to be more independent aka child support and potentially even alimony. You and your wife are enabling her friend to stay in a terrible relationship without consequences and that\u2019s what bugs me about their expectations of you caring for Harper", "> I think it's weird OP didn't mention Emma/Harper's relationship in the post tbh because it's critical to whether he's an asshole or not.\n\nI'm not so sure. Emma is 7. She can understand if OP explains to her that there's \"family time\" and there's \"best friend time\".\n\nBest friend time is when they go on a play date. Family time is when you hang out with your parents. \n\nThat's easy to understand for a 7 year old in my opinion.", "It's an issue regardless of whether they're friends or not. Jennifer shouldn't be pushing OP into a paternal role and OP's wife shouldn't be encouraging it. He's not Harper's father. The girls may be best friends now but these are young kids, they may not always be friends. It's pretty common for kids to grow out of their childhood friends as they get older and find other people they want to hang out with. What happens if the girls have a massive falling out?

It's setting Harper up for a double whammy of pain if Emma ever decides she doesn't want to be friends anymore. \n\nIt wouldn't be an issue if this were a normal friendship where both kids have their own parents and both parents take turns at taking both girls out as 'daughter and bestie'.

It sounds like this little girl would have a shitty life without you guys.  Her mom might be good, but her dad is a massive sack of ... well, everybody knows.\n\nI get that you would like to spend time with just your daughter, but I guess the question I have is... why do you feel like Harper is taking away the opportunity to bond with your daughter by spending time with you as well?  Do you have any idea what you are giving to both your daughter and her best friend by including Harper and showing her how a dad should treat their child?  You are not only creating a bond with your own daughter but you are creating a bond with Harper.  This is not something that I think you should just toss away, as that will tell Harper that she is not worth your time and love.\n\nShould this be your responsibility?  No, of course not.  But think of all of the stepdads out there that are raising kids that are not theirs, biologically, and they form an amazing bond with kids that are not biologically theirs.  These dads are amazing.  These dads show kids that they are important and loved and are worth being loved.  That's what you are showing Harper.\n\nIf you suddenly start excluding her, how do you think that will make her feel?  How do you think that will make your daughter feel?  Is your daughter asking for one on one time?  If so, that is different, but you didn't say that this is something that your daughter is asking for, so I am assuming not.\n\nMy heart breaks for Harper.  Not only does she have a deadbeat dad, but now you want to toss her aside too.

You're not her husband, you're not Harper's dad, and you shouldn't be playing that role unless you want to. You didn't consent to having a second wife and daughter.\n\nI would have another serious conversation with your wife about the fact that it isn't fair to you to be playing father figure to a child that isn't yours. Furthermore, her attempts to support Jennifer are also putting your daughter in a position where she has *no choice* but to have Harper as her best friend. Even further, you need to talk to her about the fact that your family's \"help\" is ensuring that Harper is stuck living in a home with a man who *will* damage her. That's a guarantee. \n\nCome up with some boundaries that you think are reasonable and present them to your wife. Hopefully you'll be able to agree on some. If she wants to \"help\" them beyond that and it doesn't affect you or Emma, don't try to stop her. \n\nI hope your wife sees that she's hurting them more than she's helping by not encouraging Jennifer to leave.

Maybe take Harper ***occasionally .*** \n\nThe longer this goes on, the more it will be normalized and harder to break. But again, this is on Jennifer and her husband to work out, not you.

Just food for thought.", "NTA.  Your feelings are real and valid.  How does your daughter feel about this?  I think the deciding factor in your next steps is how your daughter views the situation.  Does she see Harper as her sister, her best friend, her person though thick and thin?  Of does she see Harper as a nuisance getting in the way of her family time?  Do you and your wife intend to have other kids, or is there a chance that her primary social partner will be Harper as a surrogate sibling?\n\nThe answers to those questions will inform you about how this affecting your family dynamic.  I would also add that there are a LOT of people who became healthy teens and adults solely because someone else stepped up when their parent or parents would/could not.

You may be the only positive father figure she ever gets.", "NTA, but this is a tricky situation, imo. At this point it's not as simple as people make it out to be. That you just take your daughter and leave the other girl behind with your wife.\n\nI commend you for everything you've done so far to help out this girl. I was this little girl, except it was both my parents who were deadbeats. While I understood when other relatives or friends didn't include me for \"family time\" it hurt. Not really about being excluded but because it served as a reminder that I don't have that. But that is not on you, it's not your responsibility to always be the surrogate family for her.\n\nI think your wife needs to be on board though. If you just leave with your daughter it can cause a whole list of issues. Your daughter may resent you, if you leave her friend and may grow to dislike daddy daughter time. Your wife and the other mother may start to resent/make remarks that, of course aren't justified but they may put all the blame on you, instead of the deadbeat. And ultimately that little girl is going to feel like the only \"real\" dad figure in her life doesn't like her, making it 2 dads that can't be bothered.\n\nAgain, it's not your fault at all, but you AND your wife need to put distance on her and her mother's visits.

As someone who was the kid \"taken in\" and has formed life long bonds with my friend's family (I spend most holidays with my friend's family, and whenmy friend was gone for mother's day, I got her mother a card and a gift), it's hard for me to blame the wife.\n\nI think there's a kind way to ask that certain activities be JUST with the daughter but this is the daughter's best friend AND a kid in need.

She doesn't need to be with one friend 3-4 days a week, maybe she'll even make some other friends.", "I think with wife clearly not on board & Harper's mom around all the time (maybe way too often?) it's just a really tough situation to handle without blowback. He seems considerate & nice from his post but this just feels full of traps. \n\nIf he blows up daddy daughter Saturdays (or mom or Harper's mom blows it up) that's going to be way worse than having Harper along. \n\nIdk I hope he manages to figure it out in a way that works for him & his kid.", "NTA and y\u2019all are doing wayyy too much for someone else\u2019s child. I\u2019m sorry, but paying for dance classes and Mother\u2019s Day gifts?!? What\u2019s your wife smoking that she thinks this is even remotely acceptable?\n\nStart taking your daughter to things without Harper. When your wife or friend have the audacity to flap gum and ask about it, remind them that Harper is not your child and you won\u2019t be raising her as such. In fact, it might be worth point blank letting Jennifer know that her poor choice of a father figure is impeding in your relationship with your daughter and now causing issues in your marriage. While you might feel for her situation, it\u2019s HER situation so she needs to figure it out on her own time and dime. \n\nLastly, why exactly are these 2 at your house everyday? Honestly it\u2019s looking like Harper\u2019s dad isn\u2019t the only one putting in a lack of parental effort. Jennifer is straight up leeching off another family.", "NTA\n\nWhy TF are *you* in the guest room? Why does Emma have to share her time with you with someone else? This is unfair to everyone except your wife. She gets quality time with her best friend, while you are a dad to two kids. You need to rethink this relationship if this gets you kicked out of the marital bed. Smh", "If you only take Emma, she will be mad cause Harper is home. Your wife needs to step up and handle this with her best friend and tell her that she needs to kick her dead beat husband to the curb if he won't help.", "NTA. Instead of sorting out the issues, your wife is playing the passive aggressive no talking game. This is not okay between spouses in a marriage. As of right now, it seems like you're doing all the work while she's \"being their for Harper\". NO, the parents are the one that must be there for her, not you, and not especially your wife through you when she's the only one making that policy. As of right now, both of Harper's parents, they're making excuses with the \"unnecessary\" while still letting you pay for everything. How much you want to bet the father is telling his friend \"let the fool pay for it\" with his buddies? They three of them, your wife, Harper's mother and father are loving the fact that you're taking care of the girls while they're all off doing wtf they want with the free time.", "Why cant your wife act like a grown woman? Just go talk to the kids dad.", "I understand that Amber is trying to help her best friend. You\u2019re a great dad, and she sees that Harper is missing that. Amber probably thought this was a two-birds-one-stone thing: daddy daughter bonding is already happening, Emma gets to bring her best friend, and now Harper gets to experience a positive male role model and a supportive home away from home. This is Hallmark Channel sweet and well intended. \n\nHowever. \n\nThis is cutting into the one-on-one bonding time you\u2019re getting with your child, and you\u2019re building resentment toward an innocent party (Harper). Neither of those things are okay, and that\u2019s what you need to focus on with Amber. Praise her for the above, and then outline that while you\u2019re open/happy to help Jennifer out and bring Harper along when you and Emma do things, the frequency needs to change and boundaries need to be made. Whether that\u2019s two Saturdays a month are Emma/dad only days, or x number of nights a week maximum for Harper visits; something that shows Harper is still welcome and loved in your home, but space needs to be reserved for family time. \n\nNTA and good luck", "Put your foot down and tell your wife \u201cthis Saturday I\u2019m taking just Emma\u201d no room for argument. \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting time with your daughter and it\u2019s not your responsibility to raise someone else\u2019s kid. \nNTA", "Your wife is an ass for how she reacted. Sleeping in another room and not talking to you for voicing frustrations? Really?", "NTA - but this is very complicated and you need to tread carefully and plan out your next steps thoroughly.\n\nFirst of all, I see a lot of comments regarding the possibility of Harper\u2019s Father being abusive and therefore your family is potentially acting like a kind of shelter, while this may be true, it is not your responsibility to parent Harper in every spare moment you have. Jennifer can absolutely leave her house on weekends and do something one on one with her own child safe and away from the dead beat Dad. Not saying support isn\u2019t important in DV situations, I think if that is the case then you should absolutely help Jennifer out, but not 24/7. Also, the fact of the matter is, if Jennifer is being abused then she needs to get out, I know that is easier said then done but she needs to make a plan, whether that plan take a month, a year, whatever, and she needs to be open and honest with you, especially if your wife already knows, this isn\u2019t something that should be hidden from YOU, because otherwise it comes across like she needs a break from her daughter, she can\u2019t get that from her lazy husband so she sticks you with the job, and if that\u2019s all this is, I\u2019d be pretty annoyed too.\n\nSecond, I see a lot of people emphasising the importance of Emma having a say in all this, and while I agree, I think we all know that any 7 year old is not going to say no to having their best friend over all the time, but this doesn\u2019t mean the relationship and one on one time you want with your daughter gets disregarded because of that, you also get a say, you\u2019re also entitled to that, her feelings on the matter don\u2019t invalidate yours and vice versa. So it\u2019s that reason I think completely cutting Harper off is a bad idea, I think you\u2019ve lost the battle of every Saturday, BUT every second or even one Saturday a month alone with your daughter you are absolutely entitled too and you should seriously push for (with your wife and Jennifer, prior to Harper coming over, so plans can be made, Jennifer can take her daughter to the park and have a picnic one Saturday after dance class, it doesn\u2019t cost a lot to make peanut butter sandwiches and play, she CAN do this and she SHOULD, it\u2019s important for their relationship too).\n\nAlso, people are so focused on Jennifer and Harper that they are disregarding OP, Emma and his wife! Social development is important, but so is learning to be independent, if Emma has Harper always in dance class and always around 24/7, and always around every-time she leaves the house on weekends this creates an unhealthy co-dependent relationship, what happens if Harper and Jennifer do end up leaving the dead beat and they have to move away? Suddenly Emma\u2019s entire world is upside down because she\u2019s never had to be alone in a social environment and doesn\u2019t know how to interact with new people because she\u2019s never had too. \n\nAlso, sounds like OP never gets alone time with his wife either, which is completely unfair and important for their relationship, her emotionally manipulating you by sleeping in the other room is rude AF and does make her the AH in this situation though. I can\u2019t decide if she just wants to prioritise her relationship with her best-friend at the cost of her marriage and your time with your daughter, or she does know something that she isn\u2019t telling you, either way, she\u2019s still the AH, because how are you meant to respond to a situation you know nothing about?\n\nCommunication is key, but don\u2019t bother with the dead beat; it\u2019s not going to achieve anything. You need to sit down with Jennifer and your wife, away from the kids and ask what\u2019s going on, if abuse is the case, then okay, you\u2019re happy to help out with Harper but not every weekend, Jennifer needs to step up and be a parent here too, yes okay dad sucks but this is the situation she\u2019s in and now she has to deal with it, there\u2019s plenty of single mums out there who have zero support and they still find ways to entertain their children. If abuse is not the case then you are not willing to provide free childcare every weekend, because the fact is, is that if abuse is not the case then you\u2019re a glorified baby sitter and role model for her child with none of the benefits of it being your actual child, so she either needs to tell deadbeat to step up, or get out. \n\nYou\u2019re doing nothing wrong by wanting a close bond with your daughter, and Harper is doing nothing wrong by just following along. You need to set boundaries and communicate. Remember this isn\u2019t Harpers fault and your relationship with her will most definitely have impact on her future BUT you can still achieve this positive effect by helping out every other weekend, instead of every free moment you have. \n\nAt the end of the day, no matter what the situation is, you\u2019re clearly a good dad and are doing nothing wrong by trying to prioritise your daughter. No matter the justification or reason behind what is going on, you\u2019re still entitled to your life and feelings.", "But shouldn't she COMMUNICATE with OP then (and possibly make him understand)?\n\nPouting on a couch would not do the trick.\n\nThis is not an easy situation and should be treated as such, and if OP is to be involved he should be able to voice his opinion too.", "Let\u2019s assume this, why is wife not talking to her husband and be like this is the situation? Wife chose her friend over her husband. While OPs feelings are completely valid.", "To be honest it seems like he doesn\u2019t mind some of the time, but here are the issues:\n\nA) he\u2019s doing it all the time\n\nB) the parents don\u2019t contribute financially for anything \n\nC) wife\u2019s friend has her husband and op too\n\nD) OP\u2019s wife punishes him when he doesn\u2019t want to go along with it all the time.\n\nPersonally I think I\u2019d confront the dad myself.", "Wait, how is the silent treatment and moving out of the bedroom a reasonable reaction? His wife is shutting down his feelings and acting like a child.", "Exactly this. OP needs to tell his wife if she wants time with her friend she can go to her friend\u2019s house instead of the friend coming to theirs. I think wife truly thinks she\u2019s helping friend but by letting her stay so much at OPs house wife is enabling friends escape from relationship reality.", "Being a deadbeat and doing zero work for the child, leaving the mother to struggle alone is abuse in my books", "It isn't just the weekend either. OP has said he only talked about the weekend because that is when he is free. But Harper and her mom also comes over on the weekdays as well. At this point, it sounds like Harper and her mom spend more time at OP's than at home", "I see you and validate your experience bc I've witnessed a similar situation first hand.\n\nMother (T) and daughter (S) with a complicated situation at home. To escape from it, they started spending more and more time at a neighbor's, who the mother was friends with. This neighbour (L) was a SAHM who had been born in another country and had almost no family there, so she valued the time T dedicated to her.\n\nBut they starting spending more and more time every day, and weekends too. Dad (J) would take their daughter (R) to visit grandmother one saturday a month and S would pout because she was not included. They would come every day after school and expect L to include them in the family plans for dinner.\n\nThey became so enmeshed that T and S expected J to give nice Christmas and birthday presents to both, and to be included when the family went shopping for clothes and school supplies for R. They would borrow L and R's clothes and would not return them, and when asked about it they would say the clothes were a present and it was L who didn't remember it.\n\nThings came to a stop after T threw a tantrum when the family decided to go away for 2 weeks. She called L a lousy friend and for the following weeks T tried to harm the family's reputation by telling everybody that L was a bad parent, her house was an awful mess and J was a father with a bad temper who would yell all the time. \n\nT would paint herself as the hero who was helping them improve their living conditions by cleaning around the house and spending time talking to J, since the reason he was always angry was L not understanding him bc she was a foreigner.\n\nTL/DR: an enmeshment situation where a woman got so dependent from her friend's family, that she became delusional about her and her daughter's role in the family dynamics.", "Honest question though, how long is this sustainable for?  They are only 7 now so it's easy. Not going to be easy as they get older. You and your wife pay for things and go places because Jennifer can't afford it. It's fine now because it is relatively inexpensive. But what happens with vacations, expensive gifts, cars, college?  How far is your wife willing to go to help Jennifer out?  \n\nYour wife is either 1. Mad at the wrong person (should be Jennifer's husband and to an extent Jennifer herself) or more likely 2. Knows you are right deep down but you are the only safe person to be mad at. I'm sure she has had many conversations with Jennifer about her deadbeat husband but that falls on deaf ears so she takes that out on you.   \n\nYou need to put your foot down but do the transfer gently.

She had great parents but my parents ended up basically being her second set.\n\nI could understand it if they were just feeding Harper lunch when she's over and he was taking the girls to an occasional movie or something, but it's kind of weird that he's paying for actual dance classes for Harper and teaching her to ride a bike.

It's important.", "As others have said, this is good advice. But OP also needs to get his wife to agree to some limits. Is he going to be on the hook for the little girl's college costs?

It is gross that his wife is using emotional manipulation on OP to get her way in this situation.", "Emma may thank you for doing this.  While she likes Harper and wants to be a good friend, she prolly gets tired of being saddled with Harper all the time.  I feel bad for everyone involved here.", "Right?!

And, know it might not happen tomorrow.  As a rule, women do not marry abusers, in that they don't knowingly pick one.  Hence, they often have feelings for the person they thought they married, not who they did marry.  It can take some effort to reconcile the two positions.  And, we are a Cinderella society.

We had two sisters who lived nearby that were close in age to me and my siblings. Their parents were both together, but they worked a lot and just weren't very present. They also got a divorce around the time the kids hit college, so probably not the most loving environment either. \n\nMy parents always went out of their way to have them over, and would bring them with us on day trips and would have them over for dinner frequently. Similar to you, my parents never felt it was their place to discipline, but that wasn't happening at home either, so basically they were never held accountable for anything. It was whatever when we were kids, but less cute as we got older.\n\nI was actually pretty close with the older sister growing up, and did my best to maintain the relationship over time. But around the the time I finished college, I started to notice how one sided the relationship was. (I was pretty timid when I was younger and it made me a bit of a doormat.) \n\nShe was really into anime and went to conventions pretty frequently and like clockwork, when a convention was coming up she would reach out to \"hang out\" which always turned into me \"helping\" her finish an item for a cosplay (I'm much more handy/artistic than she is) and her scoring a free meal from my parents by asking my mom if we could get pizza. Well, the last one I helped her with, at the end of our hang out, she invited me over the next day to see her new place that she was renting with some friends. I go at the appointed time (a bit of a drive) and she's not there. She didn't answer my calls or texts. Later I see on social media that she went to the mall with her roommates. And that was basically it. I decided I was done right there. A few months later when she called wanting to \"hang out\" and acting like nothing happened, I chewed her out and hung up on her.\n\nMy parents told me they were proud of me for standing up for myself when I told them, but I think in their eyes it was akin to a sibling squabble. They weren't willing to choose sides themselves. I didn't realize this until a few months later when they got an invite to her destination wedding. They asked if I would house/dog sit for them. I told them absolutely not. They tried to guilt me into doing it by saying it was a place my mom had always wanted to visit. I said I was 100% willing to watch the dog any time they wanted to travel but under no circumstances would I do it if it was going to benefit someone who treated me so poorly. I told them how shitty it was that they were unwilling to support me on this and I'll admit I didn't talk to them for a couple of days. They finally got the hint and ultimately didn't go, but our relationship was a bit strained for a bit after that. \n\nI get wanting to give kids a safe space, especially if they have a tough home life, but at the end of the day, it shouldn't be at the expense of your own kids. To me, the outcome of OPs situation should be very dependent on how his kid feels and what she wants.
