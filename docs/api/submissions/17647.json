He is the type of guy that brags about how he never changed a diaper. \n\nJennifer and Harper are usually at Amber and my house  on the weekends because Harper\u2019s dad is drinking and watching sports all weekend. On Saturdays I normally sped all day with my daughter because I don\u2019t see her as much as i want to during the week. However with Harper being there every Saturday  anything I do with Emma I have to do with Harper. Take Emma to the zoo it\u2019s Emma, Harper and I. Taught them both how to ride bikes, takes them both to dance class, take them both to the kids salon, and so on.  \n\nMother\u2019s Day was the last draw, I took them both to dance class Saturday morning ( Amber and I also pay for both dance classes because dead beet won\u2019t)  on the way home Emma asked if we could stop to get something for mom for Mother\u2019s Day, I said sure but then it ended up I had to buy something for Harper to her her mom as well. On the way home I just kept thinking why am I buying someone else\u2019s wife a Mother\u2019s Day gift, that\u2019s his job.\n\nA few days later (because I did not want to ruin Mother\u2019s Day) I told my wife that I am tired of raising Harper, her real father needs to step up. I tired of it taking away time I get to spend with Emma. She said that  Jennifer is her best friend and we need to be there for Harper.\n\nNow she is not speaking to me and sleeping in the guest bedroom.

If your wife wants to step up for Harper, then SHE needs to do that, not put it on you. She should be taking her places and doing things with her", "NTA. As you say, it is robbing you of the time you could otherwise spend with your daughter, one on one. Best friend is one thing - virtually living in your house is another thing.", "NTA\n\nStop taking Harper, it's that simple. You're having dad daughter bonding time and don't want a tagalong. \n\nIf Harper wants to come along on these things then make her mother come with you all, but not your wife.", "NTA but I don't think anyone is addressing the bigger picture.\n\nIt sounds like Jennifer is keeping harper away from her father for her well being (you mentioned drinking) \n\nIf Jennifer is an abusive relationship you and your wife be to support and encourage her to leave.\n\nYou wife may be aware, which is why she was so defensive about wanting to be there.", "NTA- personally I\u2019d never be able to not take in a kid that needed it, a lot of kids with shitty parents have their mental health saved by the kindness of friends parents who step up. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s not something you\u2019re required to do. I do feel bad for the kid though, none of this is her fault.", "NTA. Your wife needs to prioritize y'all's family and not her friend's. You should be able to have peace in your own home.", "NTA, I think your wife\u2019s heart is in the right place but it\u2019s become too much. Maybe you could frame it differently by telling your wife you want to have 1-1 time with your daughter and also make sure that the three of you have time to spend alone together as a family.", "Info: how does Emma feel about sharing every Saturday with Harper?", "NTA,  first I want to say you and your wife are good for doing all that you have done,  it will probably be memories the little girl will cherish because her dad is an ass.  Now you don't have to do anything for her. Yes it may be harsh for her to not go to everything you and your daughter do but she is not your kid.  Her father sounds like a butt , and her mom keeps her in that situation is not good.  \n      Just remember you can just want dad and daughter time and if your wife or her best friend says anything you just tell them you wanted a special day with just your kid and any good father should want that.   Don't feel bad for not wanting to raise a child that is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your wife is in denial. Harper is not your daughter, and you do not have any legal obligations to spend time with her. When your wife calms down, you need to call a meeting with Jennifer and Harper's father and be very clear in communicating your feelings. If Harper's father is truly neglectful, Jennifer needs to take action against him and file for divorce, and obtain full custody. Your wife needs to see the big picture.", "NTA. But FWIW, your daughter probably has more fun with a little friend there, and you're doing a good thing. My next-door neighbor's grandparents did the same for me when I was a kid/teen bc my parents worked all the time. I loved them so much and am very grateful for the time and love they invested in a \"grandkid\" who wasn't theirs. \n\nYes, not your problem. Yes, your wife needs to talk to Jennifer about it. Yes, NTA. BUT it sounds like Emma's dad sucks, and you don't, and I think every kid deserves to have adults rooting for them. It would be really nice of y'all to find a balance and for you still be there for her when you can - for your kid's sake at the minimum!", "NAH, except obviously the AH dad. That said, how does your daughter feel about everything? Because I am pretty sure she views that girl as a sister at this point. \n\nYou do sound really cold towards a child who has done nothing wrong but be born. \n\nYou and the wife need to come to an agreement on this though.", "NTA your wife is enabling her best friends behavior. She's equally complicit in this.", "By your title I thought you were talking about a step kid and I\u2019m glad that\u2019s not the case. While I do pity Harper and her situation, you are not her father and you have no desire to be. Her real dad needs to step up. NTA", "NTA. You've already gone above and beyond to help a kid, but at this point you're acting as a surrogate husband and father to help your wife's friend. Your wife is placing her friend above you. Assuming you weren't screaming and cursing, it seems like you brought an issue to your wife, explained your very good reasoning, and she continued to prioritize her friend. Being there for her friend's kid is different from raising them.", "Please hear this, OP. I absolutely understand your frustration and I don\u2019t think it is by any means unjustified, so I think you are NTA, but also please consider this: your daughter\u2019s friend is a child. She did not pick her parents (who, by the sounds of it are major AHs), and I absolutely don\u2019t want to tell you what to do in your own life, but I can tell you that your parentage of your daughter\u2019s friend will mean the world to that little girl. Growing up, my parents might as well have been the parents of all of my friends. They would take us all places, offer real advice and real parenting. They were generous, nearly beyond their means for all of my friends, and that has made a massive difference in the lives of me and my friends. My father passed away this last year, and it has been incredibly difficult to be without him, but I am incredibly grateful that he left a legacy of kindness and fatherhood not just with me but with all of my friends who he cared for and loved.\n\nYour generosity and love with that little girl may go unseen with her deadbeat parents, but you are offering a childhood of compassion, friendship, and support for a child who is otherwise without. That said, I know it can be a huge strain, and you have to do what is right for you. Hope you can find a solution that works well for all parties.", "Based on your responses I think you\u2019re a good guy who actually doesn\u2019t mind also caring for Harper within reason. Your point about buying a Mother\u2019s Day present for Harper\u2026 I think your anger might be coming from the unfairness and resentment towards her Dad, you feel like you are being taken advantage of by Harper\u2019s parents and in a way you are, but I don\u2019t think you necessarily need to think of it that way. You probably make that little girl\u2019s Saturday and your daughter (who might get lonely as an only child) by getting to spend so much time with her best friend. My sister was best friends with an only child and she was constantly doing things with their family, even whole vacations, because the parents wanted company for their daughter. \n\nI think it adds a layer of resentment because Harpers Dad sounds like an exceedingly distasteful individual. But I think if you focus on the good feelings related to Harper and not the resentment for her parents, you\u2019d probably feel a lot better about the situation. And make some one on one time with your daughter too, it\u2019s okay to want that and ask for it! If you make it a yes to your daughter rather than a no to Harper your wife should be okay with it.\n\nIn any event, NTA.", "NTA. And I get but good on you and your wife for doing it this long ! You\u2019re making that little girl more happy then you probably know", "NAH. I understand wanting to spend time with just you daughter. But dang do I feel bad for Harper. I really see where your wife is coming from. She wants to help her best friend and the little one.\nAs a child I loved that my friends parents included me in my friends activities. My parents never did such things with me. I'm sure if you knew how much this probably means to Harper you might feel slightly different. But I do understand not wanting to do this every week and getting some quality time with just your daughter.", "Could domestic violence be the real reason that Jennifer and Harper spend the weekends at your house? If he drinks that much, could he be violent? It seems very unusual for a wife and child to spend every weekend away from home.", "Eh\u2026 I\u2019m going to go with NTA. I understand where you are coming from\u2026. But Harper likely has the expectation that weekends are days she spends with her best friend and her best friends dad. She likely treasures those days. Now you aren\u2019t required to this for a kid that isn\u2019t yours, but her dad sounds like a mindless jerk who doesn\u2019t give a crap about any woman in his life.  So with that, you would be very kind to keep her involved and be a positive male role model for her. However, moving forward you could coordinate that Harpers mom and dad to spend some weekends with her, so you and Emma could have quality time together. \n\nAs far as your wife. Her actions are boarder line childish. She shouldn\u2019t lock her self in the guest room because you are trying to set a boundary. It sounds like she enjoys not having to watch the kids and relax with her friend on the weekends while you provide the entertainment for the kids. She needs to break the silence and you both need to hash it out like married couples do. Set boundaries, talk it out, and make plans.", "NTA.  How do you feel about including Harper SOMETIMES (once a month, for example) but not every Saturday?  That way she would get the influence of a decent man to look up to (even though it isn't your job) and you would get more solo time with your daughter.  Maybe offer that?\n\nThe other weekends...well, your wife and Jennifer can take Harper to do things if it's important to them.\n\nThe real AH here is obviously Harper's Dad", "NAH \n\nBut dude this is your daughter\u2019s best friend. This is important to her, too. There\u2019s nothing wrong with scheduling dad-daughter time or family time without Harper ahead of time, so that it\u2019s understood the expectations. But if you just wholesale change everything your daughter isn\u2019t going to be happy and it won\u2019t result in the magical time you\u2019re hoping it will be.", "NTA. Heaven forbid you should want to spend quality time with just your daughter. Your wife is asking a lot. She just kind of took on another child, and volunteered your time, without asking you first", "You\u2019re definitely NTA I think you\u2019re very reasonable but man do I feel awful for that little girl", "NTA\n\nI can't say you're the asshole.  But I can also say that I've done this before and loved every minute of it.  GF had a sister that lived with us with her kids and husband.  Husband was shit.  Aside from sex and romance, I ended up playing the role of husband and dad for those kids, along with mine.  It was not uncommon for me to be dad to 9 kids on any given weekend.  (I'll explain...lol  I have 3 from a prior marriage.  My Gf has 2 from the same.  GF and I have 1 together.  Sister had 3 kids at the time)  Was it absolute chaos?  Fuck yea it was.  But it was awesome.  \n\nYou're not me.  You don't like it, and that's ok too.  Wife does need to understand that you want to be there for your daughter.  Occasional things with Harper are fine, but all the time is a bit much if you don't like it.", "Info are the gift and things you spend on her getting paid back to you?", "INFO: Is jeffiner still married to harper father?", "NTA\n\nYour wife, her bestie and the deadbeat dad are all using you because on Saturday they get to chill without kids since they're BOTH with you.\n\nNext time instead of hiding her guilt in the guest bedroom, your wife and her bestie are going to manipulate the girls into trying to guilt you too.\n\nIf your daughter wants one on one time with you, then your wife, her bestie and Hannah will probably try to make her feel guilty as well.\n\nEither put your foot down or start leaving out with your daughter early before Hannah gets there or after she leaves.", "NTA\n\nMy bestfriends dad(and mom) helped raise me. This post made me feel the feels. Even though I know what that meant to me, it\u2019s still your choice on if you want to be involved with this child. \nThey didn\u2019t have to pay anything for me though. It was more love and communication. Also Dave taught me how to bob and weave. \n\nI hope your wife understands you are your own person and not just an extension of herself that she can make decisions for. I am sure she is disappointed that you don\u2019t feel the same love for her chosen family as she does. She needs to accept that and find ways to cope. Or she can decide that isn\u2019t the person she wants to be married to and her and her bestie can go be platonic life partner\u2019s.", "NTA but please keep doing it anyway.  Someday when Harper grows up and expects men to treat her with respect, it will be because of her association with you.  You're not doing it for Jennifer or for deadbeat dad, you're doing it for a blameless 7 year old who got really lucky that you're in her life.  Having said that, maybe take Emma camping or something-something that will require your wife and her friend to handle Harper and give you some one on one with Emma now and then.  Thanks for what you've done so far-I really hope you find a balance that enables you to be there for this little girl in a way that works for you.", "While you are NTA, I do think you should look at it from harpers perspective\u2026 you could be a positive male influence in her life, sounds like she doesn\u2019t have that. It doesn\u2019t \u2018cost\u2019 you anything other than time you are already spending with your daughter, and could make a huge impact in this kids life.\nI agree her dad should step up, this is unlikely.\n\nETA: I missed you are paying for her classes, that part definitely seems unnecessary- but just hang out time is what I meant \ud83d\ude42", "Info: having you been acting in a fatherly capacity towards Harper for most of her life? Your nta for wanting one on one time with your own child.. but something about being a kids role model and treating them as your own and then abruptly changing the dynamic feels icky to me.", "NAH But you know, just because you step back from doing things with Harper, that doesn't mean the biodad will step up. And you saying he 'needs to step up' is nothing but pissing in the wind. \n\nI get where your wife is coming from. I get where you're coming from. You guys need to find a compromise like 'I will do one thing per weekend with Harper, after that it's me and Emma. I'm not her father. I don't want to be her father. I will help a little but not at the expense of our daughter and myself.'", "NTA but I think you\u2019re a great man for including your daughters best friend the way you are.  You\u2019re showing her what a good dad and husband looks like and that\u2019s admirable. I completely understand wanting alone time with your daughter. Is there a way you would be willing to compromise and do both? Maybe every second weekend or switch up and let the girls spend Saturday together one weekend and Sunday together the next? \n\nIf this little girl stays friends with your daughter, she will most likely grow up calling you a second dad. That\u2019s so sweet. If costs are a factor (which they 100% would be for me), then maybe ask for  funds from the parents for the activities/meals. Your wife needs to be the one asking for that though since it\u2019s her friend right? \n\nYou may be partially raising a kid that\u2019s not yours, but you\u2019re giving your daughter a best friend, a sister, memories to last a lifetime that she otherwise wouldn\u2019t get!! Some people are lucky enough to keep their childhood friends for their whole life and what you\u2019re doing now is laying the groundwork for your daughter to have a lifelong best friend. It might not work out in the end, as friends grow apart, but I think it\u2019s just beautiful for your daughter.  \n\nSounds like your wife needs to be taking both the girls shopping for Father\u2019s Day so they can both pick YOU out a present! \n\nIt also sounds like you and your wife need to have a good talk without either of the girls around. Both of your feelings got hurt and it\u2019s best to be honest and talk things out. No one is in the wrong here. There might be more going on behind the scenes or some guilt (your wife has a better husband than her best friend) since sleeping in a different bedroom for more than one night and the silent treatment is not a healthy or constructive way of dealing with a problem. It\u2019s you and your wife against the problem (you not getting alone time to be a dad to just your daughter/your resentment to the other dad) not you and your wife against each other. \n\nI wish you both all the best!", "NTA.  You have gone above and beyond, and your wife needs to tell her that occasional Saturdays are fine but most weekends you need time with your daughter alone.  Your wife is TA and so is her friend and dead beat husband.", "Info: What does your daughter want?  I  understand your frustration, but you need to find out what your daughter wants.", "How are you \"raising\" her by being a decent human being (although now, I dont really think you are).  \n\nDoes she have a stable dad and home life?  \n\nNope, but hey, you're OK with that it seems.\n\nIf I were your daughter and I found out you were \"put out\" by my friend, whom I loved and cared for - you know what would happen? \n\nResentment.  Shock and disbelief that You, my own dad,  would de-value someone I valued, as \"not worthy of your time and effort\" amd a \"throwaway\" person.\n\nWow, just wow.", "As an parent, it\u2019s your responsibility to do what\u2019s best for your child. Is Emma better off with Harper at her side? Also, you can\u2019t avoid thinking about what\u2019s best for Harper. What do you think she needs in order to be healthy and become an independent adult? Whatever it is, her dad is incapable of providing it. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect him to change. If you withdraw your support, it will affect Hanna, Emma, and Amber. Will you be better off? You need to consider your options carefully. Talk to your wife and try to find a solution that is acceptable to both of you. NAH.", "Wow...Harper probably sees you as a great example of a father to her...until she reads (or hears about) this. \n\nUltimately NTA...but assuming it is in your means this is more of a \"you gained a (surrogate) daughter\" situation. Kind of sad to see you reject that...", "NTA and you should definitely have a talk with this sorry excuse of a father, if anything just to tell him what you think of him", "NAH But what does your daughter want? I was the Harper growing up and I loved my bffs dad, like I think every year I should buy him Father\u2019s Day cards. My bff was an only child so she wanted to always have a friend in a given activity. We are in our 40s and still very close, she is my family. I\u2019m godmother to her children. I share stories about grandpa and mom she we were little. I\u2019m so lucky her Dad let me be a part of their lives.", "NTA. You deserve time with just your family.", "NTA, clearly. If anything you're amazing for doing so much. More so for knowing your limits & how it's affecting your time with your own child. As a compromise, can you cut it down to every other week & explain that you need daddy/daughter time? Maybe invite the deadbeat dad to join those weekends where the other child is coming?\n\n\nGrowing up there were two girls that lived across from me with their grandma. Their mom was in jail & their dad was only there sometimes. He didn't keep a steady job & was clearly on things.\n\nMy parents took those girls with us everywhere from age 8 forward. Church, parks, shopping, the mall, everywhere. They were kinda like siblings except they slept at their own house, didn't have chores & my parents were always nice to them. \n\nAs a child it was fun at first but there came a point (around 13) where I hated it. Even if we weren't getting along, they were invited. They had no rules at their home & bragged about staying out, went with our mutual church friends to concerts & things my parents didn't let me go to, started stealing from the stores when my mom took us shopping, etc. \n\nThey absolutely loved my parents & called them Mom & Dad but were never disciplined or treated like we were. My parents showed preferential treatment. \n\nThey both dropped out of highschool & got pregnant. My parents were very supportive of them. Meanwhile I was top of my class, dancer, nhs, etc but my dad never came to a single event other than graduation. Our relationship was very strained & nothing I did was good enough.\n\nLooking back, I know that what my parents did was a kindness that they needed. I still feel like it was at our expense -my parents had more kids than they could afford without adding those 2.\n\nAs adults we aren't even friends. They aren't family & the few times we've connected & tried to be, they still acted like they were somehow superior. They spoke of \"mom & dad\" like they were saints. It was irritating. \n\n*Your wife might not understand where you're coming from but you can tell her she's welcome to do all the things with that kid if she wants,! You have your priorities straight & I'm glad to see it! Setting the boundaries now will help!", "NTA\n\nAs a child I was forced to spend time with another child on every fun outing. This child was not family. This child was not well behaved. I completely resent the time that I was made to spend with her.", "NTA, but suck it up and keep helping Harper. It sounds like the thing that is gnawing at you isn\u2019t Harper, it\u2019s feeling like that AH is getting over on you. He\u2019s a deadbeat. His opinion doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nOne day you\u2019re going to get a Father\u2019s Day card from her. She\u2019ll be in college or have her first kid, and will recognize what you\u2019re doing now. With any luck, she\u2019ll have seen a good male role model and won\u2019t make the same mistake her mom did. \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility, but it is in your power.", "INFO: seems like a big leap, having that conversation calmly to your wife sleeping in another room. Is something missing from the story? Otherwise, an easy N T A.", "NTA however, you need to consider Harper and Emma\u2019s friendship will be affected by you leaving Harper out.", "NTA sir, not the asshole at all. Your points are extremely valid! Also why is Jennifer paying for nothing towards her child and why is she with someone who not only doesn't care about her but also doesn't care about his daughter?\n\nYour wife is wrong in this case and when you do fun things with your daughter you don't have to take her friend Harper with as well. Harper's mother can plan a fun day for HER daughter.", "Info\n\nDoes Emma want her around? That would be the most important deciding factor here for me.", "NTA, you shouldn't be expected to fill the gap left by a deadbeat dad. I feel bad for Jennifer and Harper both.\n\nBut honestly, look at the behaviour you're modelling for your daughter and her friend: You are showing them both how a supportive partner and father should behave. You're demonstrating to them both that fathers should be there for their children, and husbands should be there for their partners in their lives. You're doing an amazing job, and I hope you are appreciated for the support you've offered to your daughter, her friend, your wife, and her friend. You taught someone else's daughter how to ride a bike? Man... that's impressive, kudos to you for stepping up.\n\nI think if you change your perspective a bit, it will feel less like a chore and more like something that is strengthening your relationships with your wife and your daughter. That doesn't mean you should be expected to bring Harper along every Saturday, but when you do so it will definitely make a positive impact on your daughter's memory of you and the expectations she has of a partner later in her life.", "NTA. so when does your wife spend time with you? It sounds like all of her weekends are spent with Jennifer. What if you say you want family time on the weekends, just the three of you, in order to strengthen your family bonds?\n\nShe is definitely being an AH for her reaction to you not wanting to raise another man's child.", "NTA but also Harper is the victim here. \n\nIt would be martyrish for you to be her father figure.", "This is a difficult situation because your daughter likes having Harper there.  But, you deserve some alone time with your daughter.  So maybe start small.  Talk to your wife and Emma alone and say that starting with xx Saturday, once per month you and Emma will spend a Saturday alone.  You and your wife then need to explain this to Jennifer and Harper, making sure that Harper knows that this is not about her and that you enjoy spending time with her also (even if it isn't true, she is a child and she needs to believe this - especially with the horrible dad she has).   Make your plans with Emma for your day alone and enjoy it.  Then you can decide if you need to make more time, and ease Emma into the new routine.", "NTA. I was going to say NAH, because I totally get where your wife is coming from, but the way she reacted is overboard unless there's something you're not being honest with us about.", "ESH, because it sounds like this kid doesn't actually cause any problem for you, besides the fact that you feel that you \"shouldn't have to\" deal with her.  If you wanted more time with just your daughter, although you say she's perfectly happy to have her friend always along, you could have communicated that in a much better way. On the other hand, not speaking to you isn't good behavior, either. \n\nI think you should come back to your wife and talk about what both of you value and want or of this situation. And also think of the potential you have to do good for someone who doesn't have a stable father figure. You can come up with a balance that is good for everyone.", "Ok, so NTA because I get it. This sounds frustrating as hell. But maybe you reframe how you are looking at this. You are giving both your wife and your daughter a pretty big gift through your actions here. Your wife probably really wants time off where she can spend time with her friend. And your daughter probably loves getting to spend time with both you and her best friend. Chances are she views this as a super amazing time, and she probably cherishes the fact that her dad wants to spend time playing with her and her friend. So you are being amazing in two ways. But clearly it is interfering with bonding time you want strictly with your daughter. And that makes sense.\n\nMaybe each Saturday morning you ask your daughter if she wants to bring her friend or if she wants a day of just the two of you, and then you let your wife know your plan because you are choosing to let the daughter you want to bond with make choices for herself. You could even frame it as a choice between two different activities if you want to make whatever it is she does with you a more alluring choice. But then you are actively making plans and not just taking what the weekend hands you, you know? If it is a day out with her friend, let your wife know when you are dropping the friend off because you are going to pivot to some daddy/daughter time so give her and Harper\u2019s mother basically a non-negotiable end time to your babysitting. Maybe plan to go to the zoo, but then you guys are coming back to drop off Harper so the two of you \u2014 or maybe even the three of you, since there is also a wonderful opportunity to bond as a family unit \u2014 are going out for dinner. You need to both make room for your daughter\u2019s wants and needs but also use common sense to build out time for yourself. Why the heck didn\u2019t you say \u201cyes, but we\u2019ll just drop Harper off with her mum before we go shop for Mother\u2019s Day\u201d for instance?\n\nThe fact that Harper\u2019s dad is a deadbeat sucks, but you have a chance to be a pretty spectacular dad and husband here. And you have a chance to change how this all shakes out every weekend, but you need to communicate with your wife and daughter. But also don\u2019t discount the fact that you are bonding with your daughter even with Harper there. You are showing her how much you care about her by caring for her friend.", "This is complicated. You\u2019re not an AH for wanting to spend alone time with your own daughter and for not wanting to pay for or take care of someone else\u2019s. However, your wife\u2019s reaction makes me think you didn\u2019t express your point very eloquently so maybe you\u2019re the AH for that.\n\nEither way, you need to be more communicative about what you want and need from this situation. It is reasonable to not want to buy gifts for others but the parents didn\u2019t expect you to do that. The girls asked you to. It also seems that your girls are best friends and that\u2019s probably how you ended up taking on both of them. If you decide that you and Emma should get two weekends a month alone, that\u2019s that. And I think that you should consider being more mindful of when you take Harper. Since you now know that she\u2019ll want you to buy a present for her mom, maybe ask that that be a day for you and Emma.\n\nA little communication goes a long way.

Your wife has to HER OWN family first.", "NTA - You\u2019re obviously not the asshole here, but I\u2019d challenge you to think this through a little more.  What you\u2019re doing for this little girl could very well be life changing for her.  Kids need engaged male role models.  Also, engaged non-parent adults have a material impact on the academic success of kids.  \n\nI think what you\u2019re doing is wonderful.  Her Dad isn\u2019t going to change.  You\u2019re filling an important void.", "NAH except Harper\u2019s dad.

I do understand why your wife feels she can\u2019t just abandon her best friend when she\u2019s in a deeply shitty situation \u2013 however, if you\u2019re unhappy, she should listen to and support you, and set some boundaries around your family time. You\u2019re her chosen life partner, not her friend.\n\nI hope you\u2019re both able to come to a satisfactory solution.", "NAH\n\nExcept for deadbeat dad\n(and your wife, but she's on the line because she has good intentions)\n\nYou need to push back to your wife's best friend and let her know that she needs to step back. It's okay to want to spend time with your own family and not parent someone else's child.\n\nOn the other hand, you are likely the only father figure  Harper may have, unless her mother leaves deadbeat. You are modelling a generous and attentive father, and being a good role model to her. Harper *needs* that, and while I understand that you are at the end of your patience with her inept parents, I just wanted to let you know that I commend you for stepping up when her father hasn't.\n\nMaybe if you speak to Jennifer and tell her that you're not going to make up the shortfall anymore, or even speak directly to deadbeat, they might change and try and be more attentive parents, but that probably won't happen.\n\nIts a hard situation to navigate.", "NTA. Just want to start off with saying what you are doing is amazing. However it\u2019s understandable to want to also have father daughter time and family time.it seems reasonable to have days set aside as family only.

She cannot tell you how to spend time with your daughter.", "NTA, and bad cess to Harper's father.  OP, your frustration is valid, but *tone and approach* man.  First, figure out what is it that is really bothering you.  Is it the expenditure of money, or of time?  Sounds like mostly the latter, so...  approach wife with this angle, that you need some actual 1-1 time with Emma.  Figure out what kind of schedule for Harper coming over is more reasonable, so you get time with daughter, and she still gets time with her friend.  Let's not overlook the child's interests here.\n\nAnother thought...  daily time and boring daily life has a more powerful impact on a child than weekly \"dad-onslaughts\".  You might consider how to work your schedule so that you get as much possible daily routine involvement with the daughter.  Be the guy who tucks her in -- or brings her back to bed when she escapes.  Be the guy who packs her lunch -- and put little notes in the lunchbox.  See where I'm going here?", "Esh", "Wow, if you gotta raise her friend's kid, at the very least, she should put out for your efforts. The friend, not the wife. While I am joking, it almost seems like you have two wives. If you can't reason with your wife, then come on saturday, take your daughter alone and go out, and leave Harper behind and say it's daddy/daughter day. Maybe they will take the hint.", "YTA. Your response to a kid who is abandoned by her dad is \u2026 resentment? It isn\u2019t her fault. You have a chance to be a positive force in the life of a kid. I don\u2019t get it. Yes, her dad should do more. So man up and tell him. If no one sticks up for kids who are left behind by their parents, they\u2019re gonna have a hard time in life. So keep helping this kid. \n\nI had abusive parents growing up. Thank god for my friends parents, who I basically spent every weekend with, because my house was fucked up.

Not sure why you\u2019re so mad tbh.. If it\u2019s at the Dad, take it up with him. Like YO! Take your daughter out on Saturdays, so I can do mine 1:1. Otherwise, use your words better. Tell your wife, \u2018I\u2019m happy to do every other Saturday where we include Harper, but not every single like it\u2019s become.\u2019 That\u2019s reasonable.

But let\u2019s think down the road a bit. I highly doubt you\u2019ll regret being such a kind man to the other little girl, the influence you have in her is way better than she\u2019s getting anywhere else, especially from her dad. Now my idea would be to say hey Emma and I have plans on (blank) it\u2019s a solo day for use you will just have to entertain Harper on your own and set aside a Saturday or two to spend 1on1 with your little girl.\nAlso Harper will remember you being such a kind man to her your her father figure. Try to look at it with a better view \nNTA at all", "Going against the grain here. YTA.\nBut so is her dad. Seems like spending time with you guys is the closest that young girl will ever get to a loving family.

You aren't an asshole for being frustrated and tired of raising someone else's kid, you're an asshole for not recognizing the positive impact you're having on that kid's life.  It's probably also worth pointing out your life might **still** be like this even if she had a great dad; kids are pack animals, there's a very real chance one of them would always be with the other one regardless.\n\nHarper is innocent here, she didn't do anything wrong.  When she grows up, she's going to have a glowing opinion of her friend's dad that was there for her when her own dad wasn't. No one is disputing that is her dad's job, not yours... but to be mad your daughter has a friend this close to that you're being a good role model for?  Besides, what good is getting mad about it going to do besides alienate your wife and make Harper's life worse?", "YTA.

It\u2019s weird how you expect your wife to stand up and make the effort to contact the other family when you were just as capable of doing it yourself.

Absolutely.  But that is someone who's gone *above and beyond* for a child that isn't theirs. Your wife needs to acknowledge that what's been happening is above and beyond. \n\nBut! 7 years in,  you've set the expectation and Harper is NOT going to understand your withdrawing. So hmm.... for taking 7 years to decide this was an issue.\n\nWhy don't you PLAN father daughter days WELL in advance with the statement that it is strictly you two only and the moms will need to find something for Harper to do those days.\n\nEdit: after OPs response and reconsidering the wording, I'm going to change to NTA. Is it crappy to Harper, who won't understand,  yeah. But OPs question is was it AH to say that to his wife and the answer is No, because you're entitled to your feelings.  If you feel that way, you feel that way. I think that OP has more options than he's considered without making it a fight with his wife though.", "NAH. It sounds like you need to have a conversation with Jennifer about how this is affecting things. Maybe there\u2019s underlying issues as to why Jennifer  and Harper are always at your place. If Jennifer\u2019s husband is always drinking and refusing to do anything regarding his daughter, then there\u2019s nothing you can do to make him do anything. \n\nRealistically, the one true outcome out of this is Harper not understanding why you\u2019re no longer hanging out with her. And by no means are you obligated to do anything for Harper. You\u2019re right, you\u2019re not her father but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t have a father anyways.", "YTA, but gently. Harper has a deadbeat dad, and no matter how much you think he needs to step up, he won\u2019t. He should be doing all the things you do, but he will never. \n\nBut do you know what Emma and Harper have right now? They have a role model father.

Your daughter always knows she\u2019s safe and cared for at home by two parents who lover her.

He is the type of guy that brags about how he never changed a diaper. \n\nJennifer and Harper are usually at Amber and my house  on the weekends because Harper\u2019s dad is drinking and watching sports all weekend. On Saturdays I normally sped all day with my daughter because I don\u2019t see her as much as i want to during the week. However with Harper being there every Saturday  anything I do with Emma I have to do with Harper. Take Emma to the zoo it\u2019s Emma, Harper and I. Taught them both how to ride bikes, takes them both to dance class, take them both to the kids salon, and so on.  \n\nMother\u2019s Day was the last draw, I took them both to dance class Saturday morning ( Amber and I also pay for both dance classes because dead beet won\u2019t)  on the way home Emma asked if we could stop to get something for mom for Mother\u2019s Day, I said sure but then it ended up I had to buy something for Harper to her her mom as well. On the way home I just kept thinking why am I buying someone else\u2019s wife a Mother\u2019s Day gift, that\u2019s his job.\n\nA few days later (because I did not want to ruin Mother\u2019s Day) I told my wife that I am tired of raising Harper, her real father needs to step up. I tired of it taking away time I get to spend with Emma.

Has no desire to see his half-brothers because they treat him like crap. I always was the one doing everything for my son and everyone elses kids tagging along because of (insert 1000 excuses).

She\u2019s young now, but if you keep being there for her, as she gets older she\u2019ll realize what man stood by her and shaped her. She\u2019ll bring value to your life as well.

What a healthy father figure looks like. \nIt's hard when it splits time with your own kid and a good way to set boundaries there is to have some scheduled (well in advance) 1 on 1 time with your daughter. Make it about time with her not time without her friend. \n\nI urge you so strongly to show up for the other little girl though, if she's friends with your daughter long-term you might save them both from abusive boyfriends, drugs, or a host or other potential problems.", "Nta.

If Jennifer is your wifes best friend then maybe Jennifer can look after her while you take your daughter on a fun trip for some quality time.\n\nGive your wife the option to either look after her friends kid **or** come along.", "NTA. You need to have a \"Come to Jesus\" conversation with your wife.\n\nAnd frankly, the discussion should be about a bigger topic than having to take Harper everywhere with you and Emma on weekends. Or about having to pay for stuff for Harper that her dad will never agree to pay for.\n\nWhat you need to confront them on is the fact that the poor state of Jennifer's marriage, and your wife's overriding desire to help her friend is now beginning to interfere with your own marriage.\n\nYou have legitimate concerns, both that the situation is interfering with your ability to spend 1:1 time with Emma, and that you are being placed as an involuntary father figure for Harper.\n\nYour wife's response to hearing those concerns should have been to listen to you, discuss what your concerns are and try to come up with ways to rectify the situation. (Which, yes, probably will mean doing less for and with Jennifer and Harper on weekends.)\n\nBut that's not what happened here. What she did was made a declaration that boils down to her friend and her friend's child being more important than the needs of her husband and her daughter in this area. And then followed it by the silent treatment and her moving to the guest room.\n\nAs soon as she did that, this became an issue about your marriage. About the fact that she *is* placing a relationship with her friend above her relationship with you. I am not saying that she shouldn't support her friend.

But what happens when Jennifer's marriage starts to really go downhill? (Which it sounds like it has a good chance of.) If a better balance is not found, her need to support her friend could become a huge problem in your marriage.\n\nside-note: when you can get to re-addressing the need to be able to spend 1:1 time with Emma, here is an aspect to call out. Emma may love getting to spend lots of time with Harper... **now**. That does not mean that she will always feel this way. As she moves towards the tweens and teens, she could easily start to become resentful that she can never go anywhere with just dad... or just mom. That Harper or Harper and Jennifer are always around. This could become especially problematic when one or both of them start developing friendships separate from any they mutually share.\n\nLearning and finding a better balance would be helpful for all 5 of you.", "NTA. During my childhood, I had a friend whose dad was not in her life. She spent a lot of time at our house, and she always got on well with my dad. He treated her like family & she often went to him for advice. He\u2019s a really, really great dad. If she asked for help, I\u2019m sure he would always say yes. But it was also important for my dad & I to have our own relationship, and we do. He will also catch up with her when I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m not envious of that because I always knew that my own relationship with him was special & valued. \n\nWhilst it\u2019s lovely that you do those things with Harper, it shouldn\u2019t be at the detriment to your relationship with Emma. There will likely come a time where they feel competitive for your attention. It sounds like they interact like siblings, and that\u2019s just a natural part of the sibling relationship. That\u2019s not fair to Emma, and eventually it will lead to Harper feeling like another man doesn\u2019t want her. That\u2019s not a healthy pattern. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for you to want a relationship with Harper that is independent of others. You sound like a good dad, but also a good person. What you\u2019ve been for both Harper & Jennifer is really lovely. But it isn\u2019t your responsibility, and it shouldn\u2019t be. At some point, Jennifer needs to hold her husband accountable for his shitty parenting & stop expecting you to fill that role in their lives.

Your wife clearly cares for both her friend and her daughter so forcing her to not be there for them because you don\u2019t like it isn\u2019t a battle you should be having (and I\u2019ve phrased it like that because your wife cares for these people and that will be her perspective). Instead tell your wife you miss spending time with your daughter, and that on x day that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to do. What they do with Harper is then their decision. You\u2019re not leaving her out, you\u2019re prioritising the relationship with your daughter. \n\nIt\u2019d be the same if she was your daughter, you\u2019d still need one-on-one with each child. It\u2019s important as they\u2019re individuals.", "Just start taking Emma. If your wife pushes back, tell her that you and Emma need father daughter time.

Just the two of you, no mom, no friends, etc. That way you\u2019re not specifically excluding Harper, but you still get one on one time.

Not to this extent, and we would switch, so my mom had all the kids a decent chunk of the time. All that to say, my friend\u2019s dad is this only person who did \u201cdad\u201d things, and he set the expectation for how I want my fianc\u00e9 to be with our future kids. \n\nHarper will absolutely remember you as a dad figure, and likely as a \u201cgood\u201d dad figure. Nothing you want (alone time with your kid) is unreasonable.

Why can\u2019t either of Harper\u2019s parents do it? \n\nI would tell your wife you all have to talk together. It sucks for Harper, hopefully she won\u2019t see this as another man who doesn\u2019t want to be around her, but that is not really your fault. Jennifer chose her parent for her child, she isn\u2019t holding him accountable, and she should be figuring this out. I would still take the girls out together sometimes, if they\u2019re friends they might like doing things together, but not every single time. That\u2019s a lot.", "NTA. Taking over the responsibilities of a dead beet is cucumbersome.", "Unless they have stayed over, try getting your daughter up very early before they arrive, go to breakfast together, and spend the day out. \n\nI do want to add that you should be able to have time alone with your daughter without this other child tagging along. That said, your influence on this other child now may have a profound effect on her as an adult. You are giving her normal experiences with a father figure that will help shape her future relationships in a healthy way. You know that \u201cIt takes a village to raise a child\u201d saying? Right now you and your family are the village.", "At first I thought this was just a weekend occurrence, but you indicate that Emma and Mom are at your house every day.  This is just taking advantage IMO.  Don't these two have errands and their own life to lead?  Since they are at your house five days a week, I don't think its unreasonable for you to request that weekends be for your family solely.  Sorry the Dad is drinking, but the Mom and Emma need to find other activities that either take them away from that situation.  They live in a house and the Dad is not following them around drinking I would assume.  They can also go to the library, park, other friends/relatives - it doesn't have to be 100% at your house.", "In my opinion she\u2019s not a real good mother to Emma, because she is making decisions that is taking Emma away from her one on one time with you, her dad.

If she pushes back, tell them (loudly, if need be) that your daughter will not suffer because someone else won't raise their child. This is YOUR daughter's time with her father. Not \"play father to everyone else\" time. If your wife really is a great mom to Emma, she will let her have real time with her parents.", "Why is there so little mention of Jennifer in your post? Where is she every Saturday? What does she have to say about all this, and have you told her that you're unhappy with Harper spending all this time with your family?", "But it will teach her that her options are she's with her daughter and you or with her daughter and your wife. Either way, she's with her daughter and I imagine that staying with your wife will be the more appealing option.\n\nIf you're paying for dance classes for them both every Saturday already it's not like she doesn't get time off of parenting, you're just holding her accountable on the Sunday when you want to spend quality father daughter time.", "What do you mean? Is there something with you and Jennifer?", "Then tell her mother Jennifer in advance and if she does nothing on the weekend In front of Harper you unfortunately can't take Harper with you and tell Harper her mommy will spend time with her and leave with your daughter only.\n\n After you do this a few times they ll learn ( assuming your wife and Jennifer  have working neurons in their head and actually care about hurting Harper that is).\n\nNTA", "OP can still support the kid without *literally* every event being two person.

The reality is that the kid probably gets a lot from OP as a father figure and personally I could never have the heart to end that. My husband and I are definitely the open house to any friends that need it type of people. But that\u2019s just us, I was that kid that basically moved out at 16 and lived with other friends and I\u2019ll always be grateful for that.", "Yeah this is a kid that's looking for a father because her home life is atrocious and, likely, abusive.  It sucks that it's on OP to deal with this situation and it's not really required of him to do it, but I'd have a hard time _not_ being there for the kid.\n\nYou can definitely still set boundaries like not buying a mother's day card for the kid and all that too (encourage the kid to go home and _make_ one instead).", "Me too!", "I feel so bad for Harper she is getting rejected by another father figure basically, I understand it\u2019s not OPs responsibility technically, but like where is the empathy idk??

You don't want both of the other people in your household seeing you as the jerk that was mean to their best friend. Unfortunately y'all have established the Saturday Dad takes the best friends to dance class thing as a routine. If you suggest excluding Harper Emma might be pretty upset.", "Isnt this something that should be included in the post? If your daughter wants her best friend there, that changes things. \n\nI see a lot of comment of people completely making out like the other kid is an unwanted burden your wife forces on the family. It seems everyone is happy with the situation but you. There has to be some kind of compromise that makes YOU happy too. And that means some one-on-one time with your daughter alone\u2026.but not completely cutting the other girl off.", "I was wondering this as well. Have you asked what she would prefer? Maybe she knows about the situation and is in fact grateful you help out, and taking that away for \"father-daughter time\" might lead to a conflict. Or maybe she has more complex feelings about the whole situation, secretly feeling replaced. Who knows.\n\nYou need to talk to your daughter to understand her side as well. You have a lot of emotions that are very valid, so you really need to talk this through with everyone involved and find a compromise.\n\nReally tough situation overall.\n\nNAH (except deadbeat dad)", "So stop taking Harper, if they ask you to  say \"No, I am spending quality 1-1 time with my daughter.\"", "Why is having Harper along a problem? I've been the Emma in this situation (exercise my \"Harper\" also had an absent mom) and never felt like having my friend along was diminishing dad time.

Maybe just talk to your wife to arrange for them to go do something on some Saturdays  so you and your daughter  can spend quality time alone? Other then that I don't see what else to do since your wife feels pretty strongly about it.", "Then definitely NTA you\u2019re being generous with not only your time but also money. Obviously the other dad is a raging asshole but I\u2019d put Jennifer in the asshole camp as well tbh because there is no way I\u2019d ever put another family in a situation to spend money like that on my kid as a normal expectation. She\u2019s either wildly oblivious or extremely inconsiderate", "Say it\u2019s a Daddy Daughter Date, just for the two of you.  Talk to her about how it\u2019s important you two have 1:1 time. \nAlso, it\u2019s great to have friends and even a BFF but your daughter needs time away from Harper. Everyone needs to be able to manage life independently. Even if she\u2019s too young to understand that. Being so emeshed with someone isn\u2019t good for her social development.", "That you want to spend time with just her because you don\u2019t get to see her that much during the week and you miss her? \n\nYou don\u2019t have to cut Harper out completely, just basically tell your wife you\u2019d like at least every other weekend to take just your daughter out after dance class. If Emma gets upset you could decide just one weekend for sure every month can just be you two. Cause the point is to have fun and get to bond with your daughter not make her upset.

If it's because he abuses them when they're there it's a safety issue, as opposed to him just being uninvolved in the kid's life and stingy where they can 'tough it out' for a day a week for sure. \n\nOf course it's still okay to have boundaries and to want time for your family, but this seems to be really difficult and a time for a really thorough conversation before making any hard-set demands.", "So maybe when you plan a daddy daughter day, don't say what you're going to go do.  Say you haven't quite decided yet.  That way you're not saying we're going to go do X and Harper gets excited/jealous that she wants to go do. I think it's reasonable to ask your wife for this time,  but maybe make it a consistent thing.  For example, Saturday mornings dad and Emma go out.  Get out of the house before they can come over.", "i don't think you're an AH  by any means, but i feel sorry for that little girl.

He could have gently told Harper, Your daddy is going to get a card for your mommy with you so I'm not going to have you pick one out with Emma.

He just doesn't want to be the bad guy.", "They need to have a conversation about it. \"I'm tired of raising a kid that isn't mine\" might not have been the most productive conversation starter.", "Yeah, it's not fair, it's a sucky situation. That's why I said it was a soft YTA. Basically just that after creating the norm for this neglected kid it'd be cruel to take it away from her. I suppose maybe ESH would have been a more accurate judgement tho thinking more on it, but basically I think the kids should be prioritized either way.", "For not being his business he sure mentioned it a lot.", "Our house is on the way to Dance, so she comes here first.

Between age 13-16, I would spend practically every weekend at my BFF's house. My parents were divorced, and her parents were awesome and still married. They showed me a dynamic that didn't exist in my family unit. They never acted like I was a burden.
