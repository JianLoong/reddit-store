He is the type of guy that brags about how he never changed a diaper. \n\nJennifer and Harper are usually at Amber and my house  on the weekends because Harper\u2019s dad is drinking and watching sports all weekend. On Saturdays I normally sped all day with my daughter because I don\u2019t see her as much as i want to during the week. However with Harper being there every Saturday  anything I do with Emma I have to do with Harper. Take Emma to the zoo it\u2019s Emma, Harper and I. Taught them both how to ride bikes, takes them both to dance class, take them both to the kids salon, and so on.  \n\nMother\u2019s Day was the last draw, I took them both to dance class Saturday morning ( Amber and I also pay for both dance classes because dead beet won\u2019t)  on the way home Emma asked if we could stop to get something for mom for Mother\u2019s Day, I said sure but then it ended up I had to buy something for Harper to her her mom as well. On the way home I just kept thinking why am I buying someone else\u2019s wife a Mother\u2019s Day gift, that\u2019s his job.\n\nA few days later (because I did not want to ruin Mother\u2019s Day) I told my wife that I am tired of raising Harper, her real father needs to step up. I tired of it taking away time I get to spend with Emma. She said that  Jennifer is her best friend and we need to be there for Harper.\n\nNow she is not speaking to me and sleeping in the guest bedroom. So AITA?\n\nJust wanted to add some updates to questions I see.\n\nEmma and Harper are best friends.\n\nIt was my idea to spend Saturday with Emma, I work more during the week so I wanted to spend Saturday with Emma and to give my wife a bit of a break.\n\nWe pay for things be Jennifer\u2019s husband thinks it\u2019s a waste on money to pay for dance class and Jennifer can\u2019t afford to pay by herself. \n\nJennifer and Harper do things with Amber and Emma 1 or 2 times a week together during the weeknights.", "created_utc": 1684500546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lujjo/aita_for_telling_my_wife_im_tired_of_raising_a/", "score": 4561, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your wife wants to step up for Harper, then SHE needs to do that, not put it on you. She should be taking her places and doing things with her", "NTA. As you say, it is robbing you of the time you could otherwise spend with your daughter, one on one. Best friend is one thing - virtually living in your house is another thing.", "NTA\n\nStop taking Harper, it's that simple. You're having dad daughter bonding time and don't want a tagalong. \n\nIf Harper wants to come along on these things then make her mother come with you all, but not your wife.", "NTA but I don't think anyone is addressing the bigger picture.\n\nIt sounds like Jennifer is keeping harper away from her father for her well being (you mentioned drinking) \n\nIf Jennifer is an abusive relationship you and your wife need to support and encourage her to leave.\n\nYour wife may be aware, which is why she was so defensive about wanting her to be there.\n\nEdit - spelling", "NTA- personally I\u2019d never be able to not take in a kid that needed it, a lot of kids with shitty parents have their mental health saved by the kindness of friends parents who step up. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s not something you\u2019re required to do. I do feel bad for the kid though, none of this is her fault.", "NTA. Your wife needs to prioritize y'all's family and not her friend's. You should be able to have peace in your own home.", "NTA, I think your wife\u2019s heart is in the right place but it\u2019s become too much. Maybe you could frame it differently by telling your wife you want to have 1-1 time with your daughter and also make sure that the three of you have time to spend alone together as a family.", "Info: how does Emma feel about sharing every Saturday with Harper?", "NTA,  first I want to say you and your wife are good for doing all that you have done,  it will probably be memories the little girl will cherish because her dad is an ass.  Now you don't have to do anything for her. Yes it may be harsh for her to not go to everything you and your daughter do but she is not your kid.  Her father sounds like a butt , and her mom keeps her in that situation is not good.  \n      Just remember you can just want dad and daughter time and if your wife or her best friend says anything you just tell them you wanted a special day with just your kid and any good father should want that.   Don't feel bad for not wanting to raise a child that is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your wife is in denial. Harper is not your daughter, and you do not have any legal obligations to spend time with her. When your wife calms down, you need to call a meeting with Jennifer and Harper's father and be very clear in communicating your feelings. If Harper's father is truly neglectful, Jennifer needs to take action against him and file for divorce, and obtain full custody. Your wife needs to see the big picture.", "NTA. But FWIW, your daughter probably has more fun with a little friend there, and you're doing a good thing. My next-door neighbor's grandparents did the same for me when I was a kid/teen bc my parents worked all the time. I loved them so much and am very grateful for the time and love they invested in a \"grandkid\" who wasn't theirs. \n\nYes, not your problem. Yes, your wife needs to talk to Jennifer about it. Yes, NTA. BUT it sounds like Emma's dad sucks, and you don't, and I think every kid deserves to have adults rooting for them. It would be really nice of y'all to find a balance and for you still be there for her when you can - for your kid's sake at the minimum!", "NAH, except obviously the AH dad. That said, how does your daughter feel about everything? Because I am pretty sure she views that girl as a sister at this point. \n\nYou do sound really cold towards a child who has done nothing wrong but be born. \n\nYou and the wife need to come to an agreement on this though.", "NTA your wife is enabling her best friends behavior. She's equally complicit in this.", "By your title I thought you were talking about a step kid and I\u2019m glad that\u2019s not the case. While I do pity Harper and her situation, you are not her father and you have no desire to be. Her real dad needs to step up. NTA", "NTA. You've already gone above and beyond to help a kid, but at this point you're acting as a surrogate husband and father to help your wife's friend. Your wife is placing her friend above you. Assuming you weren't screaming and cursing, it seems like you brought an issue to your wife, explained your very good reasoning, and she continued to prioritize her friend. Being there for her friend's kid is different from raising them.", "Please hear this, OP. I absolutely understand your frustration and I don\u2019t think it is by any means unjustified, so I think you are NTA, but also please consider this: your daughter\u2019s friend is a child. She did not pick her parents (who, by the sounds of it are major AHs), and I absolutely don\u2019t want to tell you what to do in your own life, but I can tell you that your parentage of your daughter\u2019s friend will mean the world to that little girl. Growing up, my parents might as well have been the parents of all of my friends. They would take us all places, offer real advice and real parenting. They were generous, nearly beyond their means for all of my friends, and that has made a massive difference in the lives of me and my friends. My father passed away this last year, and it has been incredibly difficult to be without him, but I am incredibly grateful that he left a legacy of kindness and fatherhood not just with me but with all of my friends who he cared for and loved.\n\nYour generosity and love with that little girl may go unseen with her deadbeat parents, but you are offering a childhood of compassion, friendship, and support for a child who is otherwise without. That said, I know it can be a huge strain, and you have to do what is right for you. Hope you can find a solution that works well for all parties.", "Based on your responses I think you\u2019re a good guy who actually doesn\u2019t mind also caring for Harper within reason. Your point about buying a Mother\u2019s Day present for Harper\u2026 I think your anger might be coming from the unfairness and resentment towards her Dad, you feel like you are being taken advantage of by Harper\u2019s parents and in a way you are, but I don\u2019t think you necessarily need to think of it that way. You probably make that little girl\u2019s Saturday and your daughter (who might get lonely as an only child) by getting to spend so much time with her best friend. My sister was best friends with an only child and she was constantly doing things with their family, even whole vacations, because the parents wanted company for their daughter. \n\nI think it adds a layer of resentment because Harpers Dad sounds like an exceedingly distasteful individual. But I think if you focus on the good feelings related to Harper and not the resentment for her parents, you\u2019d probably feel a lot better about the situation. And make some one on one time with your daughter too, it\u2019s okay to want that and ask for it! If you make it a yes to your daughter rather than a no to Harper your wife should be okay with it.\n\nIn any event, NTA.", "NTA. And I get but good on you and your wife for doing it this long ! You\u2019re making that little girl more happy then you probably know", "NAH. I understand wanting to spend time with just you daughter. But dang do I feel bad for Harper. I really see where your wife is coming from. She wants to help her best friend and the little one.\nAs a child I loved that my friends parents included me in my friends activities. My parents never did such things with me. I'm sure if you knew how much this probably means to Harper you might feel slightly different. But I do understand not wanting to do this every week and getting some quality time with just your daughter.", "Could domestic violence be the real reason that Jennifer and Harper spend the weekends at your house? If he drinks that much, could he be violent? It seems very unusual for a wife and child to spend every weekend away from home.", "Eh\u2026 I\u2019m going to go with NTA. I understand where you are coming from\u2026. But Harper likely has the expectation that weekends are days she spends with her best friend and her best friends dad. She likely treasures those days. Now you aren\u2019t required to this for a kid that isn\u2019t yours, but her dad sounds like a mindless jerk who doesn\u2019t give a crap about any woman in his life.  So with that, you would be very kind to keep her involved and be a positive male role model for her. However, moving forward you could coordinate that Harpers mom and dad to spend some weekends with her, so you and Emma could have quality time together. \n\nAs far as your wife. Her actions are boarder line childish. She shouldn\u2019t lock her self in the guest room because you are trying to set a boundary. It sounds like she enjoys not having to watch the kids and relax with her friend on the weekends while you provide the entertainment for the kids. She needs to break the silence and you both need to hash it out like married couples do. Set boundaries, talk it out, and make plans.", "NTA.  How do you feel about including Harper SOMETIMES (once a month, for example) but not every Saturday?  That way she would get the influence of a decent man to look up to (even though it isn't your job) and you would get more solo time with your daughter.  Maybe offer that?\n\nThe other weekends...well, your wife and Jennifer can take Harper to do things if it's important to them.\n\nThe real AH here is obviously Harper's Dad", "NAH \n\nBut dude this is your daughter\u2019s best friend. This is important to her, too. There\u2019s nothing wrong with scheduling dad-daughter time or family time without Harper ahead of time, so that it\u2019s understood the expectations. But if you just wholesale change everything your daughter isn\u2019t going to be happy and it won\u2019t result in the magical time you\u2019re hoping it will be.", "NTA. Heaven forbid you should want to spend quality time with just your daughter. Your wife is asking a lot. She just kind of took on another child, and volunteered your time, without asking you first", "You\u2019re definitely NTA I think you\u2019re very reasonable but man do I feel awful for that little girl", "NTA\n\nI can't say you're the asshole.  But I can also say that I've done this before and loved every minute of it.  GF had a sister that lived with us with her kids and husband.  Husband was shit.  Aside from sex and romance, I ended up playing the role of husband and dad for those kids, along with mine.  It was not uncommon for me to be dad to 9 kids on any given weekend.  (I'll explain...lol  I have 3 from a prior marriage.  My Gf has 2 from the same.  GF and I have 1 together.  Sister had 3 kids at the time)  Was it absolute chaos?  Fuck yea it was.  But it was awesome.  \n\nYou're not me.  You don't like it, and that's ok too.  Wife does need to understand that you want to be there for your daughter.  Occasional things with Harper are fine, but all the time is a bit much if you don't like it.", "Info are the gift and things you spend on her getting paid back to you?", "INFO: Is jeffiner still married to harper father?", "NTA\n\nYour wife, her bestie and the deadbeat dad are all using you because on Saturday they get to chill without kids since they're BOTH with you.\n\nNext time instead of hiding her guilt in the guest bedroom, your wife and her bestie are going to manipulate the girls into trying to guilt you too.\n\nIf your daughter wants one on one time with you, then your wife, her bestie and Hannah will probably try to make her feel guilty as well.\n\nEither put your foot down or start leaving out with your daughter early before Hannah gets there or after she leaves.", "NTA\n\nMy bestfriends dad(and mom) helped raise me. This post made me feel the feels. Even though I know what that meant to me, it\u2019s still your choice on if you want to be involved with this child. \nThey didn\u2019t have to pay anything for me though. It was more love and communication. Also Dave taught me how to bob and weave. \n\nI hope your wife understands you are your own person and not just an extension of herself that she can make decisions for. I am sure she is disappointed that you don\u2019t feel the same love for her chosen family as she does. She needs to accept that and find ways to cope. Or she can decide that isn\u2019t the person she wants to be married to and her and her bestie can go be platonic life partner\u2019s.", "NTA but please keep doing it anyway.  Someday when Harper grows up and expects men to treat her with respect, it will be because of her association with you.  You're not doing it for Jennifer or for deadbeat dad, you're doing it for a blameless 7 year old who got really lucky that you're in her life.  Having said that, maybe take Emma camping or something-something that will require your wife and her friend to handle Harper and give you some one on one with Emma now and then.  Thanks for what you've done so far-I really hope you find a balance that enables you to be there for this little girl in a way that works for you.", "While you are NTA, I do think you should look at it from harpers perspective\u2026 you could be a positive male influence in her life, sounds like she doesn\u2019t have that. It doesn\u2019t \u2018cost\u2019 you anything other than time you are already spending with your daughter, and could make a huge impact in this kids life.\nI agree her dad should step up, this is unlikely.\n\nETA: I missed you are paying for her classes, that part definitely seems unnecessary- but just hang out time is what I meant \ud83d\ude42", "Info: having you been acting in a fatherly capacity towards Harper for most of her life? Your nta for wanting one on one time with your own child.. but something about being a kids role model and treating them as your own and then abruptly changing the dynamic feels icky to me.", "NAH But you know, just because you step back from doing things with Harper, that doesn't mean the biodad will step up. And you saying he 'needs to step up' is nothing but pissing in the wind. \n\nI get where your wife is coming from. I get where you're coming from. You guys need to find a compromise like 'I will do one thing per weekend with Harper, after that it's me and Emma. I'm not her father. I don't want to be her father. I will help a little but not at the expense of our daughter and myself.'", "NTA but I think you\u2019re a great man for including your daughters best friend the way you are.  You\u2019re showing her what a good dad and husband looks like and that\u2019s admirable. I completely understand wanting alone time with your daughter. Is there a way you would be willing to compromise and do both? Maybe every second weekend or switch up and let the girls spend Saturday together one weekend and Sunday together the next? \n\nIf this little girl stays friends with your daughter, she will most likely grow up calling you a second dad. That\u2019s so sweet. If costs are a factor (which they 100% would be for me), then maybe ask for  funds from the parents for the activities/meals. Your wife needs to be the one asking for that though since it\u2019s her friend right? \n\nYou may be partially raising a kid that\u2019s not yours, but you\u2019re giving your daughter a best friend, a sister, memories to last a lifetime that she otherwise wouldn\u2019t get!! Some people are lucky enough to keep their childhood friends for their whole life and what you\u2019re doing now is laying the groundwork for your daughter to have a lifelong best friend. It might not work out in the end, as friends grow apart, but I think it\u2019s just beautiful for your daughter.  \n\nSounds like your wife needs to be taking both the girls shopping for Father\u2019s Day so they can both pick YOU out a present! \n\nIt also sounds like you and your wife need to have a good talk without either of the girls around. Both of your feelings got hurt and it\u2019s best to be honest and talk things out. No one is in the wrong here. There might be more going on behind the scenes or some guilt (your wife has a better husband than her best friend) since sleeping in a different bedroom for more than one night and the silent treatment is not a healthy or constructive way of dealing with a problem. It\u2019s you and your wife against the problem (you not getting alone time to be a dad to just your daughter/your resentment to the other dad) not you and your wife against each other. \n\nI wish you both all the best!", "NTA.  You have gone above and beyond, and your wife needs to tell her that occasional Saturdays are fine but most weekends you need time with your daughter alone.  Your wife is TA and so is her friend and dead beat husband.", "Info: What does your daughter want?  I  understand your frustration, but you need to find out what your daughter wants.", "How are you \"raising\" her by being a decent human being (although now, I dont really think you are).  \n\nDoes she have a stable dad and home life?  \n\nNope, but hey, you're OK with that it seems.\n\nIf I were your daughter and I found out you were \"put out\" by my friend, whom I loved and cared for - you know what would happen? \n\nResentment.  Shock and disbelief that You, my own dad,  would de-value someone I valued, as \"not worthy of your time and effort\" amd a \"throwaway\" person.\n\nWow, just wow.", "As an parent, it\u2019s your responsibility to do what\u2019s best for your child. Is Emma better off with Harper at her side? Also, you can\u2019t avoid thinking about what\u2019s best for Harper. What do you think she needs in order to be healthy and become an independent adult? Whatever it is, her dad is incapable of providing it. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect him to change. If you withdraw your support, it will affect Hanna, Emma, and Amber. Will you be better off? You need to consider your options carefully. Talk to your wife and try to find a solution that is acceptable to both of you. NAH.", "Wow...Harper probably sees you as a great example of a father to her...until she reads (or hears about) this. \n\nUltimately NTA...but assuming it is in your means this is more of a \"you gained a (surrogate) daughter\" situation. Kind of sad to see you reject that...", "NTA and you should definitely have a talk with this sorry excuse of a father, if anything just to tell him what you think of him", "NAH But what does your daughter want? I was the Harper growing up and I loved my bffs dad, like I think every year I should buy him Father\u2019s Day cards. My bff was an only child so she wanted to always have a friend in a given activity. We are in our 40s and still very close, she is my family. I\u2019m godmother to her children. I share stories about grandpa and mom she we were little. I\u2019m so lucky her Dad let me be a part of their lives.", "NTA. You deserve time with just your family.", "NTA, clearly. If anything you're amazing for doing so much. More so for knowing your limits & how it's affecting your time with your own child. As a compromise, can you cut it down to every other week & explain that you need daddy/daughter time? Maybe invite the deadbeat dad to join those weekends where the other child is coming?\n\n\nGrowing up there were two girls that lived across from me with their grandma. Their mom was in jail & their dad was only there sometimes. He didn't keep a steady job & was clearly on things.\n\nMy parents took those girls with us everywhere from age 8 forward. Church, parks, shopping, the mall, everywhere. They were kinda like siblings except they slept at their own house, didn't have chores & my parents were always nice to them. \n\nAs a child it was fun at first but there came a point (around 13) where I hated it. Even if we weren't getting along, they were invited. They had no rules at their home & bragged about staying out, went with our mutual church friends to concerts & things my parents didn't let me go to, started stealing from the stores when my mom took us shopping, etc. \n\nThey absolutely loved my parents & called them Mom & Dad but were never disciplined or treated like we were. My parents showed preferential treatment. \n\nThey both dropped out of highschool & got pregnant. My parents were very supportive of them. Meanwhile I was top of my class, dancer, nhs, etc but my dad never came to a single event other than graduation. Our relationship was very strained & nothing I did was good enough.\n\nLooking back, I know that what my parents did was a kindness that they needed. I still feel like it was at our expense -my parents had more kids than they could afford without adding those 2.\n\nAs adults we aren't even friends. They aren't family & the few times we've connected & tried to be, they still acted like they were somehow superior. They spoke of \"mom & dad\" like they were saints. It was irritating. \n\n*Your wife might not understand where you're coming from but you can tell her she's welcome to do all the things with that kid if she wants,! You have your priorities straight & I'm glad to see it! Setting the boundaries now will help!", "NTA\n\nAs a child I was forced to spend time with another child on every fun outing. This child was not family. This child was not well behaved. I completely resent the time that I was made to spend with her.", "NTA, but suck it up and keep helping Harper. It sounds like the thing that is gnawing at you isn\u2019t Harper, it\u2019s feeling like that AH is getting over on you. He\u2019s a deadbeat. His opinion doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nOne day you\u2019re going to get a Father\u2019s Day card from her. She\u2019ll be in college or have her first kid, and will recognize what you\u2019re doing now. With any luck, she\u2019ll have seen a good male role model and won\u2019t make the same mistake her mom did. \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility, but it is in your power.", "INFO: seems like a big leap, having that conversation calmly to your wife sleeping in another room. Is something missing from the story? Otherwise, an easy N T A.", "NTA however, you need to consider Harper and Emma\u2019s friendship will be affected by you leaving Harper out.", "NTA sir, not the asshole at all. Your points are extremely valid! Also why is Jennifer paying for nothing towards her child and why is she with someone who not only doesn't care about her but also doesn't care about his daughter?\n\nYour wife is wrong in this case and when you do fun things with your daughter you don't have to take her friend Harper with as well. Harper's mother can plan a fun day for HER daughter.", "Info\n\nDoes Emma want her around? That would be the most important deciding factor here for me.", "NTA, you shouldn't be expected to fill the gap left by a deadbeat dad. I feel bad for Jennifer and Harper both.\n\nBut honestly, look at the behaviour you're modelling for your daughter and her friend: You are showing them both how a supportive partner and father should behave. You're demonstrating to them both that fathers should be there for their children, and husbands should be there for their partners in their lives. You're doing an amazing job, and I hope you are appreciated for the support you've offered to your daughter, her friend, your wife, and her friend. You taught someone else's daughter how to ride a bike? Man... that's impressive, kudos to you for stepping up.\n\nI think if you change your perspective a bit, it will feel less like a chore and more like something that is strengthening your relationships with your wife and your daughter. That doesn't mean you should be expected to bring Harper along every Saturday, but when you do so it will definitely make a positive impact on your daughter's memory of you and the expectations she has of a partner later in her life.", "NTA. so when does your wife spend time with you? It sounds like all of her weekends are spent with Jennifer. What if you say you want family time on the weekends, just the three of you, in order to strengthen your family bonds?\n\nShe is definitely being an AH for her reaction to you not wanting to raise another man's child.", "NTA but also Harper is the victim here. \n\nIt would be martyrish for you to be her father figure.", "This is a difficult situation because your daughter likes having Harper there.  But, you deserve some alone time with your daughter.  So maybe start small.  Talk to your wife and Emma alone and say that starting with xx Saturday, once per month you and Emma will spend a Saturday alone.  You and your wife then need to explain this to Jennifer and Harper, making sure that Harper knows that this is not about her and that you enjoy spending time with her also (even if it isn't true, she is a child and she needs to believe this - especially with the horrible dad she has).   Make your plans with Emma for your day alone and enjoy it.  Then you can decide if you need to make more time, and ease Emma into the new routine.", "NTA. I was going to say NAH, because I totally get where your wife is coming from, but the way she reacted is overboard unless there's something you're not being honest with us about.", "ESH, because it sounds like this kid doesn't actually cause any problem for you, besides the fact that you feel that you \"shouldn't have to\" deal with her.  If you wanted more time with just your daughter, although you say she's perfectly happy to have her friend always along, you could have communicated that in a much better way. On the other hand, not speaking to you isn't good behavior, either. \n\nI think you should come back to your wife and talk about what both of you value and want or of this situation. And also think of the potential you have to do good for someone who doesn't have a stable father figure. You can come up with a balance that is good for everyone.", "Ok, so NTA because I get it. This sounds frustrating as hell. But maybe you reframe how you are looking at this. You are giving both your wife and your daughter a pretty big gift through your actions here. Your wife probably really wants time off where she can spend time with her friend. And your daughter probably loves getting to spend time with both you and her best friend. Chances are she views this as a super amazing time, and she probably cherishes the fact that her dad wants to spend time playing with her and her friend. So you are being amazing in two ways. But clearly it is interfering with bonding time you want strictly with your daughter. And that makes sense.\n\nMaybe each Saturday morning you ask your daughter if she wants to bring her friend or if she wants a day of just the two of you, and then you let your wife know your plan because you are choosing to let the daughter you want to bond with make choices for herself. You could even frame it as a choice between two different activities if you want to make whatever it is she does with you a more alluring choice. But then you are actively making plans and not just taking what the weekend hands you, you know? If it is a day out with her friend, let your wife know when you are dropping the friend off because you are going to pivot to some daddy/daughter time so give her and Harper\u2019s mother basically a non-negotiable end time to your babysitting. Maybe plan to go to the zoo, but then you guys are coming back to drop off Harper so the two of you \u2014 or maybe even the three of you, since there is also a wonderful opportunity to bond as a family unit \u2014 are going out for dinner. You need to both make room for your daughter\u2019s wants and needs but also use common sense to build out time for yourself. Why the heck didn\u2019t you say \u201cyes, but we\u2019ll just drop Harper off with her mum before we go shop for Mother\u2019s Day\u201d for instance?\n\nThe fact that Harper\u2019s dad is a deadbeat sucks, but you have a chance to be a pretty spectacular dad and husband here. And you have a chance to change how this all shakes out every weekend, but you need to communicate with your wife and daughter.

You\u2019re not an AH for wanting to spend alone time with your own daughter and for not wanting to pay for or take care of someone else\u2019s. However, your wife\u2019s reaction makes me think you didn\u2019t express your point very eloquently so maybe you\u2019re the AH for that.\n\nEither way, you need to be more communicative about what you want and need from this situation. It is reasonable to not want to buy gifts for others but the parents didn\u2019t expect you to do that. The girls asked you to. It also seems that your girls are best friends and that\u2019s probably how you ended up taking on both of them. If you decide that you and Emma should get two weekends a month alone, that\u2019s that. And I think that you should consider being more mindful of when you take Harper. Since you now know that she\u2019ll want you to buy a present for her mom, maybe ask that that be a day for you and Emma.\n\nA little communication goes a long way.

Your wife has to HER OWN family first.", "NTA - You\u2019re obviously not the asshole here, but I\u2019d challenge you to think this through a little more.  What you\u2019re doing for this little girl could very well be life changing for her.  Kids need engaged male role models.  Also, engaged non-parent adults have a material impact on the academic success of kids.  \n\nI think what you\u2019re doing is wonderful.  Her Dad isn\u2019t going to change.

It's okay to want to spend time with your own family and not parent someone else's child.\n\nOn the other hand, you are likely the only father figure  Harper may have, unless her mother leaves deadbeat. You are modelling a generous and attentive father, and being a good role model to her. Harper *needs* that, and while I understand that you are at the end of your patience with her inept parents, I just wanted to let you know that I commend you for stepping up when her father hasn't.\n\nMaybe if you speak to Jennifer and tell her that you're not going to make up the shortfall anymore, or even speak directly to deadbeat, they might change and try and be more attentive parents, but that probably won't happen.\n\nIts a hard situation to navigate.", "NTA. Just want to start off with saying what you are doing is amazing.

She cannot tell you how to spend time with your daughter.", "NTA, and bad cess to Harper's father.  OP, your frustration is valid, but *tone and approach* man.  First, figure out what is it that is really bothering you.  Is it the expenditure of money, or of time?  Sounds like mostly the latter, so...  approach wife with this angle, that you need some actual 1-1 time with Emma.  Figure out what kind of schedule for Harper coming over is more reasonable, so you get time with daughter, and she still gets time with her friend.  Let's not overlook the child's interests here.\n\nAnother thought...  daily time and boring daily life has a more powerful impact on a child than weekly \"dad-onslaughts\".  You might consider how to work your schedule so that you get as much possible daily routine involvement with the daughter.  Be the guy who tucks her in -- or brings her back to bed when she escapes.  Be the guy who packs her lunch -- and put little notes in the lunchbox.  See where I'm going here?", "Esh", "Wow, if you gotta raise her friend's kid, at the very least, she should put out for your efforts. The friend, not the wife. While I am joking, it almost seems like you have two wives. If you can't reason with your wife, then come on saturday, take your daughter alone and go out, and leave Harper behind and say it's daddy/daughter day. Maybe they will take the hint.", "YTA. Your response to a kid who is abandoned by her dad is \u2026 resentment? It isn\u2019t her fault. You have a chance to be a positive force in the life of a kid. I don\u2019t get it. Yes, her dad should do more. So man up and tell him. If no one sticks up for kids who are left behind by their parents, they\u2019re gonna have a hard time in life.

Not sure why you\u2019re so mad tbh.. If it\u2019s at the Dad, take it up with him. Like YO! Take your daughter out on Saturdays, so I can do mine 1:1. Otherwise, use your words better. Tell your wife, \u2018I\u2019m happy to do every other Saturday where we include Harper, but not every single like it\u2019s become.\u2019 That\u2019s reasonable.

But let\u2019s think down the road a bit. I highly doubt you\u2019ll regret being such a kind man to the other little girl, the influence you have in her is way better than she\u2019s getting anywhere else, especially from her dad. Now my idea would be to say hey Emma and I have plans on (blank) it\u2019s a solo day for use you will just have to entertain Harper on your own and set aside a Saturday or two to spend 1on1 with your little girl.\nAlso Harper will remember you being such a kind man to her your her father figure. Try to look at it with a better view \nNTA at all", "Going against the grain here. YTA.\nBut so is her dad.

You aren't an asshole for being frustrated and tired of raising someone else's kid, you're an asshole for not recognizing the positive impact you're having on that kid's life.  It's probably also worth pointing out your life might **still** be like this even if she had a great dad; kids are pack animals, there's a very real chance one of them would always be with the other one regardless.\n\nHarper is innocent here, she didn't do anything wrong.  When she grows up, she's going to have a glowing opinion of her friend's dad that was there for her when her own dad wasn't.

It\u2019s weird how you expect your wife to stand up and make the effort to contact the other family when you were just as capable of doing it yourself.

Absolutely.  But that is someone who's gone *above and beyond* for a child that isn't theirs. Your wife needs to acknowledge that what's been happening is above and beyond. \n\nBut! 7 years in,  you've set the expectation and Harper is NOT going to understand your withdrawing. So hmm.... for taking 7 years to decide this was an issue.\n\nWhy don't you PLAN father daughter days WELL in advance with the statement that it is strictly you two only and the moms will need to find something for Harper to do those days.\n\nEdit: after OPs response and reconsidering the wording, I'm going to change to NTA. Is it crappy to Harper, who won't understand,  yeah. But OPs question is was it AH to say that to his wife and the answer is No, because you're entitled to your feelings.  If you feel that way, you feel that way. I think that OP has more options than he's considered without making it a fight with his wife though.", "NAH. It sounds like you need to have a conversation with Jennifer about how this is affecting things. Maybe there\u2019s underlying issues as to why Jennifer  and Harper are always at your place. If Jennifer\u2019s husband is always drinking and refusing to do anything regarding his daughter, then there\u2019s nothing you can do to make him do anything. \n\nRealistically, the one true outcome out of this is Harper not understanding why you\u2019re no longer hanging out with her. And by no means are you obligated to do anything for Harper. You\u2019re right, you\u2019re not her father but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t have a father anyways.", "YTA, but gently. Harper has a deadbeat dad, and no matter how much you think he needs to step up, he won\u2019t. He should be doing all the things you do, but he will never. \n\nBut do you know what Emma and Harper have right now? They have a role model father.

He is the type of guy that brags about how he never changed a diaper. \n\nJennifer and Harper are usually at Amber and my house  on the weekends because Harper\u2019s dad is drinking and watching sports all weekend. On Saturdays I normally sped all day with my daughter because I don\u2019t see her as much as i want to during the week. However with Harper being there every Saturday  anything I do with Emma I have to do with Harper. Take Emma to the zoo it\u2019s Emma, Harper and I. Taught them both how to ride bikes, takes them both to dance class, take them both to the kids salon, and so on.  \n\nMother\u2019s Day was the last draw, I took them both to dance class Saturday morning ( Amber and I also pay for both dance classes because dead beet won\u2019t)  on the way home Emma asked if we could stop to get something for mom for Mother\u2019s Day, I said sure but then it ended up I had to buy something for Harper to her her mom as well. On the way home I just kept thinking why am I buying someone else\u2019s wife a Mother\u2019s Day gift, that\u2019s his job.\n\nA few days later (because I did not want to ruin Mother\u2019s Day) I told my wife that I am tired of raising Harper, her real father needs to step up. I tired of it taking away time I get to spend with Emma.

Has no desire to see his half-brothers because they treat him like crap. I always was the one doing everything for my son and everyone elses kids tagging along because of (insert 1000 excuses).

Teach her it's good to go above and beyond for friends but that boundaries are just as important.", "NTA - I get it I do. \n\nHowever think about Harper. She has eyes she knows her dad is a looser. Spending time with you is probably the only good father figure she has and she needs you. Yes she isn\u2019t your kid and yes you should set boundaries and be able to have a weekend with just your own kid sometimes. But you may well be the only man who is a decent dude in harpers life. While it\u2019s not a job you asked for you are making a little girls life better just by being nice to her and your giving her experiences she wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. \n\nYes it is a pain, yes it\u2019s not fair but your own daughter probably understand that Harpers dad is a looser and she is seeing you be kind to Harper. You are stepping up where Harpers father isn\u2019t. She is seeing you be a great person and father by treating her and her friend equally. \n\nYou are doing a hero\u2019s job and Harper will remember it forever as will Emma.", "NTA.

If this was an occasional thing then I'd feel differently, and I'd guess OP wouldn't care, probably happy to bring his daughter's friend along sometimes.

You shouldn\u2019t be expected to stand in for her disinterested Dad, but, I think you\u2019d be missing out if you back away. You obviously have a lot to give and she\u2019s starving for a real father figure. She\u2019s young now, but if you keep being there for her, as she gets older she\u2019ll realize what man stood by her and shaped her. She\u2019ll bring value to your life as well.

He's not getting one over on you. You're manning up and showing his daughter what a healthy relationship. What a healthy father figure looks like. \nIt's hard when it splits time with your own kid and a good way to set boundaries there is to have some scheduled (well in advance) 1 on 1 time with your daughter. Make it about time with her not time without her friend. \n\nI urge you so strongly to show up for the other little girl though, if she's friends with your daughter long-term you might save them both from abusive boyfriends, drugs, or a host or other potential problems.", "Nta.

Emma is going to need a BF in life, and if Harper is the one then you are doing right by Emma.\n\nIf they feel like they are sisters and that they can trust each other, then you have done a hell of a job as a father. Its grueling to be a dad, sometimes no one but other dads will understand. But we will grind ourselves to pulp for our kids.  Also, Emma will one day understand how BS Harper's dad is and will grow to appreciate you more.

You ain't doing this for Harper, but for Emma, to set her up for a ride or die for life.", "NTA Bollocks to that! If Jennifer is your wifes best friend then maybe Jennifer can look after her while you take your daughter on a fun trip for some quality time.\n\nGive your wife the option to either look after her friends kid **or** come along.", "NTA. You need to have a \"Come to Jesus\" conversation with your wife.\n\nAnd frankly, the discussion should be about a bigger topic than having to take Harper everywhere with you and Emma on weekends. Or about having to pay for stuff for Harper that her dad will never agree to pay for.\n\nWhat you need to confront them on is the fact that the poor state of Jennifer's marriage, and your wife's overriding desire to help her friend is now beginning to interfere with your own marriage.\n\nYou have legitimate concerns, both that the situation is interfering with your ability to spend 1:1 time with Emma, and that you are being placed as an involuntary father figure for Harper.\n\nYour wife's response to hearing those concerns should have been to listen to you, discuss what your concerns are and try to come up with ways to rectify the situation. (Which, yes, probably will mean doing less for and with Jennifer and Harper on weekends.)\n\nBut that's not what happened here. What she did was made a declaration that boils down to her friend and her friend's child being more important than the needs of her husband and her daughter in this area. And then followed it by the silent treatment and her moving to the guest room.\n\nAs soon as she did that, this became an issue about your marriage. About the fact that she *is* placing a relationship with her friend above her relationship with you. I am not saying that she shouldn't support her friend. But when providing that support becomes more important to her than the needs of her own family, that is a problem.\n\nRight now, it sounds like a small to medium sized problem. But what happens when Jennifer's marriage starts to really go downhill? (Which it sounds like it has a good chance of.) If a better balance is not found, her need to support her friend could become a huge problem in your marriage.\n\nside-note: when you can get to re-addressing the need to be able to spend 1:1 time with Emma, here is an aspect to call out. Emma may love getting to spend lots of time with Harper... **now**. That does not mean that she will always feel this way. As she moves towards the tweens and teens, she could easily start to become resentful that she can never go anywhere with just dad... or just mom. That Harper or Harper and Jennifer are always around. This could become especially problematic when one or both of them start developing friendships separate from any they mutually share.\n\nLearning and finding a better balance would be helpful for all 5 of you.", "NTA. During my childhood, I had a friend whose dad was not in her life. She spent a lot of time at our house, and she always got on well with my dad. He treated her like family & she often went to him for advice. He\u2019s a really, really great dad. If she asked for help, I\u2019m sure he would always say yes. But it was also important for my dad & I to have our own relationship, and we do. He will also catch up with her when I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m not envious of that because I always knew that my own relationship with him was special & valued. \n\nWhilst it\u2019s lovely that you do those things with Harper, it shouldn\u2019t be at the detriment to your relationship with Emma. There will likely come a time where they feel competitive for your attention. It sounds like they interact like siblings, and that\u2019s just a natural part of the sibling relationship. That\u2019s not fair to Emma, and eventually it will lead to Harper feeling like another man doesn\u2019t want her. That\u2019s not a healthy pattern. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for you to want a relationship with Harper that is independent of others. You sound like a good dad, but also a good person. What you\u2019ve been for both Harper & Jennifer is really lovely. But it isn\u2019t your responsibility, and it shouldn\u2019t be. At some point, Jennifer needs to hold her husband accountable for his shitty parenting & stop expecting you to fill that role in their lives. Everyone is letting Harpers dad get away with this behaviour. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t sound like you want to completely remove yourself from Harpers life, but you just want more solo time with Emma, which is perfectly reasonable.

Let your wife know this could damage Emma as well. SHE feels she needs to save the situation and help harper? SHE needs to step up and find a healthier (read: longterm) way to help.   \nHaving an outing for Harper once and awhile is fine, but to have you play step-dad and Emma as a step-sister every weekend isn't good.", "OP it sounds like you and your wife have communication issues, and I\u2019m not gonna try and guess who is most at fault for them.

Not going to say she's TA though either. TA is Harper's dad.\n\nYou don't need to raise a child that's not your own. You should, by all means, schedule some time with your daughter for the two of you. Do consider though, still being there for Harper, some.

Instead tell your wife you miss spending time with your daughter, and that on x day that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to do. What they do with Harper is then their decision. You\u2019re not leaving her out, you\u2019re prioritising the relationship with your daughter. \n\nIt\u2019d be the same if she was your daughter, you\u2019d still need one-on-one with each child.

OP is NTA for feeling the way he does, but this isn't a long term solution.  \n\nHe should talk to his daughter and see how she feels about spending all her time with Harper. (Even bestest friends don't need to be around 24/7. The daughter might be burned out as well, and Mom's been ignoring the signs.)\n\nHe should talk to his wife about the long-term plan here.

No, that's simply not how being a parent works. If OP wants father/daughter time, he is entitled to it whenever he wants, certainly within time and reason. \n\nIt's a huge burden because he's basically being forced to take on the financial and probably emotional well-being of a child that is not his.

This is why I think Jennifer is taking advantage of your family\u2019s generosity and has superglued herself to your home. Jennifer would not even have to mention her home life to someone else to have a casual meeting with let\u2019s say 4 people once a month, so that she\u2019s not over at your house all the time. \n\nAt Harper\u2019s age, kids in my area pretty much have a birthday party every week since it\u2019s customary to invite everyone (even random kids your kids don\u2019t know). It\u2019s not a stretch to think there could be 1 event or playdate for Harper. It\u2019s also the parent\u2019s role at that age to set up playdates for kids, and I don\u2019t think Jennifer is trying. \n\nI can also see an argument made that it would be better for both Emma and Harper to have a greater diversity of friends than just one another. Does Emma only interact with Harper?\n\nLastly, even despite all of the above, Jennifer could take Harper to the mall, the park, or some other place to spend the day without anyone else.

I'm really grateful my parents were open to that. I understand you'd rather have dad-daughter time and you certainly should, but you probably really need to be careful to continue to include Harper a lot of the time.

I was so lucky to have my best friend\u2019s family unofficially adopt me. I got to spend time in a house that wasn\u2019t a hoarder hovel; I got home-cooked meals instead of whatever I could scrounge up myself as a child; I got access to supportive, attentive adults who actually cared about where I was, what I was doing, and how I was doing.

She pulled my friend and I aside later to explain that those two girls were currently homeless and living in a shelter; their mom had to leave everything behind to escape a DV situation.

Jennifer doesn't have to require anything of her husband when you are fulfilling the father role every weekend.\n\nConversely, dad is not feeling any pressure to put down the bottle and start acting like a proper parent.\n\nShe's allowing this for several reasons. The first is that Jennifer no doubt finds it easier to just let sleeping dogs lie. Why rock the boat with her husband and expect him to step up if she doesn't have to? AND she clearly doesn't have to because you are fathering her child every weekend right along with your own, so it's not like Harper's really missing a father. In fact she's double dipping in the father category.\n\nJennifer likely needs a break from her kid and you're the only one offering to take her out and do things with her. It's not like she's even having to ask. It's a combination of you volunteering and your wife telling you that you step up.

I am sure her parents were a little annoyed that I was over all the time but if given the chance she would've asked me to just come live with her. If you try to come in between that sisterly bond, regardless of your intentions, it may cause issues in your relationship with your daughter and you'll be seen as the person who is keeping her from that bond.

He is clearly an important part of Harper\u2019s life, providing both financial and emotional support. \n\nIf he retreats, will he be happier in the long run or will he regret it? Will he look back and understand that he did the best he could? As I said, he needs to talk to his wife about the problem. He will be more at peace with himself if the two of them can reach an agreement.", "I think something else to consider is at this point, OP\u2019s daughter probably views her friend as more like a sister if they\u2019re best friends who spend all this time together at her house and going to activities and doing bonding activities and hanging with OP and his wife. \n\nObviously even with birthed children, you should have 1-1 time with them but if OP starts cutting out the best friend from stuff, OP\u2019s daughter is probably going to be hurt and confused by it too.", "That's why I think this is bad for OPs marriage.

If op's daughter wants her best friend to come over all the time to hang out and go places, I think it's wrong for dad to all the sudden say they can't spend as much time together. Also, I have a hunch. There's a reason op's wife's best friend is letting this happen so much. Maybe the home environment with the dad is not a good place to be for the child, but she feels trapped. And op's wife wants to help her best friend and her daughter.

Why is he being asked to do more than his share of the work because some other dude wants to sit on his ass and watch TV all weekend?", "I think that's possible, but also giving her more grace I also really think it's possible here that OP's wife started out helping her friend and has just fallen into a co-parent role over time to the point where she really now feels an adopted parent amount of love and attachment for Harper, which is why she's now reacting so strongly. However, if that's the case she's still the AH for defacto adopting a child without communicating with her partner about it and shutting down communication about it now. (Harper's parents also, her dad for obvious reasons and her mum for... sort of the same as OP's wife - setting up this dynamic without honest and explicit communication that she was seeking a new co-parent in place of her husband).

That\u2019s a wonderful value to instill in children. Still, 1 on 1 time between parent and child is important, so I think OP\u2019s wish is valid.

Your dynamic isn\u2019t applicable here. It will feel like abandonment/rejection rather than waiting her turn.", "He doesn't want her there. I can't imagine that's particularly good for her.

A ton of kids are just roaming around with no safety, no direction, nothing good at all. It\u2019s become our normal- so, to me, OP\u2019s issue is easy. But, again, it would be my decision and it\u2019s not the right decision for everyone. OP doesn\u2019t seem to be in the right headspace to take on the emotional caring for another kid. That\u2019s ok.", "I was wondering the same thing, too. Is Jennifer and the wife just sitting at home drinking wine while OP takes the girls? Or are they taking care of things that need taking care of? The latter I could understand since kids can be disruptive ( though every weekend???). The former would be just wholly unfair to OP.", "Came here to say this. On Saturdays, you can take just Emma out and Jennifer should spend some 1:1 time with her own kid because even though there's several mentions of the dead \"beet\" dad, it doesn't sound like Jennifer spends any kind of alone time with her own kid.", "Take my imaginary award. (Award)", "Also why is he paying for dance class? If her dad won\u2019t, it should fall on her mom not you.

To develop their own traditions and shared experiences while she is still young -- whether it is fishing, or going out every Sunday morning for a banana sundae, or playing Monopoly every Saturday evening, or having a picnic for two every Saturday morning, or camping every month.\n\nHarper is denying OP and his daughter from time together, and it is time that will never be recovered -- children grow up so quickly. The fact that OP's daughter is happy with the current arrangement because she gets to hang out with her best friend does not make it right. [How many of you are still in touch with your childhood best friend? Wouldn't matter anyway; as a father, he has a right to spend precious one-on-one time with his daughter.]\n\nOP is NTA. \n\nThe fact that OP's wife is trying to manipulate him by withholding contact and affection is not fair to OP and their daughter. OP's wife is prioritizing Harper's needs over OP's and their daughter's needs. \n\nIt's very toxic of OP's wife to resort to such tactics.", "There is no reason to explain to the kid that they aren't including the friend.\n\n\"We're going to go do some daddy-daughter time!\"\n\nDon't even mention the friend.\n\nDad goes and gets his nails done with a buff and manicure, and his daughter gets a nail polish color with hers. Go for ice cream. You and I are going to the movies, the zoo. You and I are going for a hot chocolate at the cafe.\n\nThere's no reason to even mention the friend not being invited. If the kid asks... 'she's spending time with her mom today.' It's not that OP and wife discussed one on one time without the other girl. It's that Harper is with her mother. Simple.", "That is what I think too. There needs to be a sit down with the 3 adults (because the deadbeat isn't in the picture really) and a schedule needs to be made, an agreement on spending/reimbursement, and an HONEST conversation about the home life of Harper. And I mean her mom and dad's house, no OP's. If the other dad is abusive they might need help leaving but you can't just have your friend harbor you for eternity while your husband wastes your resources. Right now she doesn't have to leave him because they have a backup family. This is such a complicated issue and the only path forward is communication.", "Yeah, you're right. I didn't think about that part.", "He may see the difference in the way they interact with just them versus the friend, too.\n\nEven a weekend a month with just them may be enough to give him the relationship he wants to build with his child.\n\nIt's not an unreasonable request to want to have a bond with your very young child.", "Because he wants to spend time with his kid without her friend?", "Majority will be happy of having a friend over from time to time, but having a friend over every single quality time is essentially adopting her. Fun for the kid, but it's pretty exhausing for the parent who isn't committed. \n\nIt puts them in a weird limbo because what he considers private family time is different from his wife and daughter's private time.

It also translates well to German as \"tote Bete\".", "This is a good advice, as you will see what works best. As a mother of four I found it surprisingly tiresome to be with just one kid for a whole day.

This isn\u2019t the long term solution though.", "Yes, Harper's mom needs to use her words. Not OP. OP will be using his words with his wife and Harper's mom.", "> But then that is neglecting Emma, who sees Harper as a best friend/basically a sibling.\n\nDoes she?

There are alarms sounding for a lot of people here.", "Do you suspect there's DV going on in Harper's home?

Hence why I think asking Emma is good - get to the bottom how she feels about the constant outings together and go from there. If Emma REALLY likes that Harper is there, then maybe they could compromise at like once a month when Harper joins them too? Or he doesn\u2019t have to either because a parent is entitled to and even should get to spend time with their children alone as well - that\u2019s how you create good bonding memories and show your kid that you want to actually spend time in their company without anybody else there.", "Harper is lucky to have him in her life!", "I agree, but if Emma is going to be given a vote then Emma needs to be given a vote.

Or his friend is an EMT that's friends with a cop. \n\nThis is bad. \n\nNow the whole PD knows where the DV shelter is, and they're who we try to keep them from knowing MOST, because it's statistically likely their spouses and children need to escape there. \n\nShelters lose a lot of money when they have to relocate, and they often TRY to relocate when an abuser shows up so everyone can feel safer long term. \n\nBeing a DV activist is HARD, because you can't trust a majority of helpful people, just because they're not quiet enough about the right things.", "That and buying Mother\u2019s Day gifts etc seems like a lot.

OP deserves some time to just spend time with his daughter, but he really should make sure the activities he doesn't want Harper along for are ones that he can be consistently engaging his child the whole time, not the type of thing where parents are only taking the role as a watcher or a guide if that makes sense. \n\nThere are loads of activities that parents let their kids bring along a friend and pay the friend's way because that's what would make it fun for their kid.", "Yep. I take my kids on mommy/son \u201cdates\u201d (they started calling them that and I thought it was hilarious lol). I spend a couple of hours one Saturday with my oldest, then the next Saturday with my middle child, and when my youngest is old enough, I\u2019ll do mommy/daughter dates with her. My kids love that time together. Sometimes we go get McDonald\u2019s or Culver\u2019s or ice cream. Sometimes we just go for a walk around the neighborhood or to the park. Sometimes they volunteer to go grocery shopping with me and that\u2019s our individual time together. But it\u2019s time spent just us together and they love it", "I don\u2019t know. OP doesn\u2019t give many details on that, which makes me think that OP might be the problem with communication within their marriage", "Let me rephrase it. OP doesn\u2019t mention the level of friendship between daughter and her friend, he only mentions how shitty other father is. He seems to be leaving out a large amount of information, and/or not being honest about him and his wife\u2019s communication. If he completely locked out the friend, as in, no longer included her in their daughters life at all, that is potentially neglectful of his daughters social life, which is super important at 7. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t include enough information, and I highly doubt it\u2019s as cut and dry as they make it seem.", "Good point\u2026 there absolutely can/should be time carved out for the family unit. It doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing\u2026. \nEven setting aside Saturday morning or Sunday morning would give them time to connect before Harper joins in.", "Clear couch potato. This advice probably seems corny, but lettuce guide you to a solution by peppering in our advice.", "Harper's dad is going to be in for a rude awakening when it is time to honor her father. Graduations...awards dinners... wedding...birth of her children...christenings...she won't be thanking her birth father. She likely won't have him walk her down the aisle, or father-daughter dance at her wedding, either! \n\nJennifer & Harper should be honoring OP on Father's Day, too!", "Agree.  Very easy to influence a 7-year-old's vote.  So dad takes her out alone and waits to hear anything that sounds like \"this is more fun with just us\" or \"next time, lets bring Harper\"", ">Jennifer needs to reach out and find people to make her support circle bigger\n\nJennifer needs to hold her husband accountable instead of offloading all of his responsibilities onto other people. That man fathered a child and now he has to be a parent.", "Oh wow! I didn't actually realize that a shelter would relocate if an abuser showed up but I suppose it makes sense. Thank you!", "my family isn\u2019t the best and my best friend family kinda took me in, and never once did they buy my mother a gift, they didn\u2019t bring me to special days either. like i was invited to dinners, family events and much more but i\u2019d never intrude on her and mother\u2019s day or her and her father\u2019s day. i do realize she\u2019s a child so she\u2019s probably not seeing it that way but the mother should step up", "> I grew up in a family with four kids. Not every single activity and outing was with every single kid every single time.\n\nThe difference will be that you most likely didn't have deep seated feelings of abandonment/worthlessness festering in you.\n\nKids notice when their parents don't want to spend time with them, and they often internalize it as their own fault.\n\nThat's a very different picture from having a strong parental unit who you have to share with siblings.", "Idk if OP was really the superior dad he would have already eaten the dead beat father and have two wives, but he hasn\u2019t so\u2026", "Oh fuck off no one is saying that shit", "I mean, hes pretty much doing her husbands work already. Might as well get some of the benefits.", "Uhm...that sounds cultural and is not universal.", "My husband is fantastic, and I also love, love his family too. I don't think I could be with anyone if they didn't have a decent, kind family, because that's what I try to be for the people I love.", "Yup. I\u2019m sympathetic to the situation and both op and his wife are pulling more weight than they should have to. Hopefully neither one of the kids suffer in the crossfire of emotions boiling over.", "Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.", "Beaut ;) \ud83d\udc9c\u2728", "That was a real weird book,  and always comes to mind when I hear about beets. Thanks for the quote!", "Ahhhh someone referencing this book made me so happy. Usually when I mention Tom Robbins people think I'm talking about the motivational speaker :/", "My fav of all times. The world is round-o, round-o just like a friggin beet.", "When I was a kid I didn't want to go to the World Beat Cafe since I didn't like beets.", "I love that book", "I loled at this because that\u2019s what my youngest refers to any sport as.  Any time someone asks her about sports she just raises her arms and yells \u201cgo sportsball!\u201d Or \u201cyay random sportsball player!\u201d", "\ud83d\ude02", "Take them all", "Thanks for the laugh, DandelionOfDeath.  I appreciate, or should I say prfer, a good pun!", "I am so grapeful that others see this the way I do. I\u2019ve bean thinking that I was alone in my view point.  Olive you are such good friends to offer your thoughts and encourage mint.", "Welp deadbeat already doesn't consider spending on his daughter to be anything but a waste so... OP kind of wins by default by being an actual human being to Harper vs her negligent at best \"dad\"?\n\nThat said OP's wife putting this onto him as an assumed responsibility is a big no-no. Imagine outsourcing your spouse to help parent your friend's child\\* and then pushing back when they have a problem with it...", "Lmao this is the answer, why didnt i think of this", "Don't search by Controversial then.", "It remains me of British TV comedy The royale family. The father was glued to the chair with food stains all down his vest. \n\nOP NTA! He shouldn't be forced to father her best friends child and sacrifice father, daughter time.", "IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE", "Bears eat beets.", "Epic. Epic.", "Sounds like OP is impersonating Harpers Dad and we all know identity theft is not a joke! Millions of families suffer every year. Poor Harper.", "Beetiful \ud83d\udc40", "More like Beet.", "Don't get me wrong, I LOVE MMA and Baseball, but my kids always come first. They don't even want to watch with me. I just watch later or look at score updates, but I'm okay pushing my son a swing and missing a HR. Some people act like having kids is the end of their world, but a real parent understands just how quickly this flame goes out as they get older. You will always be a parent, but your opportunity to be something more is very short lived. I like reducing it to sportsball because it really shows you how silly it all is if being used as an excuse to give up an entire day or weekend. I know plenty of people who park in front of their TVs ALL day Sunday when football season is on. I just never understood it on that level I guess.", "Craiyon delivers\nhttps://ibb.co/sHNyDq7", "Go to Midjourney on discord. Type in the description and it will spit out AI generated art.
