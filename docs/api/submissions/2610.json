Recently they decided that I was not their friend anymore and I was fine with that. The \"joke\" had started before they decided I was not their friend anymore. But it started as a joke. Then it got progressively more and more rude. It felt that they were targeting me at that point. They tried very hard to turn my friends against me but thank God my friends are loyal.

Good job using the resources available to you, hope they continue to leave you be", "NTA. Seems like a perfectly valid reason to file a bully report.", "NTA\n\nYou were being bullied.   You filled out a bullying report.   That is what you are supposed to do.", "No, NTA at all! I also had a parent die when I was young (I'm now almost 60), and I think it scared some kids. The thought of their mom or dad dying is too much for them to think about so they lash out at you to reassure themselves nothing like that will ever happen to THEM. \n\nIn 10 or 15 years, they will realize what they've done and feel terrible. That doesn't help you now, but filing that report did. You're doing fine. Please accept a hug from this internet stranger.", "NTA. Absolutely not. Sounds like you used a tool the guidance office made available exactly as intended, and the consequences are what you expected them to be. \n\nI'm so sorry for your family's loss, and that your former friends were jerks. I don't think filing that report was petty in the slightest.", "NTA you don't need to allow people to treat you like that. I'm real sorry about your mom, and i'm sorry your friends turned out to not be good ones. \n\nFor the future, if someone is nice to your face when it suits them but then goes behind your back or decides to be mean to you on a whim then they also aren't good friends. You deserve better, you gotta hold yourself to a higher standard, and thats exactly what you did by reporting them. You 100% did the right thing, you gotta take care of yourself. \n\nAlso, talk to your dad. He misses her too. And he's the best person to talk to because he knew her the best. The ones we love aren't truly gone if we still talk about them <3", "NTA\nMy daughter's dad died when she was 8. She was bullied at school as a result.", "NTA, one of my best friends growing up lost his dad at a young age.. some kids at school were bullying him, using the dads death as the main point of attack. It was obviously mean, but they went a step further and vandalized the only thing my friend has left of his dad. His car that my friend was supposed to inherit\u2026 well, We were in middle school so I\u2019m sure these kids didn\u2019t know they were literally going to be felons.. doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior at all. I\u2019m glad you reported it before it got out of hand.", "NTA. You used the bullying report the way it was intended. I am sorry for your loss and glad you have some loyal friends.", "NTA sorry you had to experience that", "NTA.    They suck.  Bullies get what they deserve eventually.\nYou don't need them", "NTA.  There is absolutely no way you could possibly be the a-hole here.  You were patient hoping the bullying would stop, and when it didn't you gave them fair warning to stop it, but they continued.  You are left with no other option but to file the report purely because they made the choice to continue their bullying behavior.  They need to stop, and I'm proud of you that you had the courage to take the step to make them do so.", "NTA you gotta do what you gotta do.", "NTA, I would\u2019ve slugged him but that\u2019s me and kids these days don\u2019t do that.", "NTA", "NTA. Their actions were their choice, the report was the consequences of those actions. You don\u2019t need to take abuse from anyone.", "NTA. They need to learn how inappropriate their behaviour is, and it sounds like they need firmer consequences because they aren't listening to people telling them. I know it sucks to feel like you're getting someone in trouble but it's them who are getting themselves into trouble. Try to remember that!", "NTA. If anything you should have acted sooner to put a stop to it.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and I\u2019m sorry your ex \u201cfriends\u201d are so insensitive.\n\nWtf would they think it\u2019s appropriate to tease you about this? \n\nI\u2019m glad you spoke up and filled in a report about them, they should have gotten suspended tbh", "NTA and the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t have a mom, my dad and I share yours\u201d goes a long way in shutting people up or starting a fist fight.", "NTA, hope karma comes knocking at their door. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, it\u2019s so painful that you didn\u2019t get those years with your Mom. I hope you can feel her with you sometimes.", "NTA\n\nMy heart goes out to you on the loss of your mother. I bet she would be proud of you for standing up for yourself though. I am, and I\u2019m just an internet stranger (although I\u2019ve been bullied so I can relate to how awful it is to get bullied). You did exactly the right thing.
