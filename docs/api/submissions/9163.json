For about a year, I've been playing with a group of people from a club that I pay to use.\n\nDuring this time, I've always worn baggy/old jerseys and long pants because I prefer to dress modestly despite the weather. I live in FL and come from a Christian family. \n\nRecently, I decided to wear sports wear because it's hot and I felt more confident in myself. The sports wear is a long, fitted tights and normal armless top. \n\nThe day of the incident, one of the married men John (38m)murmured something I didn't quite catch while we were on a break. He said I was 'trying to be sexy'. Then he proceeded to smile, laugh more and say he didn't mean anything bad, just that he was used to seeing me dress more comfortably and I didn't need to change for anyone. \n\nOf course I was taken aback and felt horrible but I see ass on the field all the time, so I don't understand how I'm the one trying to be sexy when I'm covered save for my arms. Instead, I laughed it off and avoided him. \n\nOne of the coaches was there and I was playing with him. When he gives me advice which I appreciate, he calls me 'good girl' once I execute the moves. He's an older 60yr old guy whose son plays with us too and he brings his wife to watch us. They're very family oriented and lovely ppl and I think he treats me like a daughter imo. He's very strict and I  respect him a lot. Anyway, John seems to not like that.\n\nJohn started calling me 'good girl' too which feels weird. One of the other girls I'm friends with commented how inappropriate it seemed as well. \n\nI went privately and spoke to John but he made another 'joke' that I was using some kind of 'magic' to get the head of our volleyball association to like me. He also questioned if I was rly a pastors daughter. I felt bad when he said that. \n\nHowever, I did tell John that he should focus on his strokes rather than on what I wear or who I have a bond with. And if I was a good or bad Christian, then only God will pass judgment, not man.\n\nJohn laughed and said men would do a lot more than just pass judgment on me. I got what he meant but idky I froze up. I said he's an embarrassment to his marriage and everything good about this court. Only one girl heard but I don't think she told anyone about it. John said I embarrassed him and hell go to the head to have me removed if I don't apologize. I refused. It's been two days and nothing has happened yet but there's so much tension I don't feel like going back. \n\nMy church friend thinks I'm TA as he was only looking out for me initially before I exaggerated it into smth worst but my volleyball friend thinks I'm not TA.

As you are sadly aware, one of the downfalls of religion is that broken humans use faith as a weapon to wield in order to manipulate to get what they want. You are 100% in the right here - your relationship with your God is between you & Him/Her & what you choose to wear is NOT John's business. John is behaving inappropriately & anyone who hears about  or witnesses it & tries to parse it as \"looking out for you\" is not acknowledging reality.

Continue on your path to straddle your faith AND break the bonds that you find hold you back from being confident in asserting what you know to be true. If this league is something you value, I'd suggest speaking to your Coach or the organizers,  if they're people you trust (as if he'll behave this way with you, he'll do it to someone else) & even if you decide to find another league because you don't feel respected & protected here, you can walk away knowing that you tried to bring attention to the problem.
