It\u2019s not your day. Why should you be out thousands of dollars and obey idiotic rules? Go and and maybe find something fun to do with your brother?", "NTA\n\nWow I really wasn\u2019t prepared for my own response here. Usually I\u2019m willing to cut brides a lot of slack. That ends when they tell someone to dye their hair for the wedding. Everything after that request got steadily worse. That price tag is absurd but I\u2019d be willing to look past it if you\u2019re all wealthy enough to regularly spend that much on a vacation. Caring about the cars you arrive him is so weird it sounds fake.\n\nI recommend watching some videos and reading more on narcissism. It seems like you might have done some of that already since you used the term \u201cgolden child\u201d but that can be general too so I thought I should add the recommendation anyway. I\u2019m sorry that your mother poisoned you and your brother\u2019s relationships with your sister by showing blatant favoritism and imbuing her with such an over-inflated sense of self. You should definitely not let your mother off the hook for her role in this monstrosity of an adult. That being said, your sister is an adult who\u2019s getting married and her delusional controlling behavior is her own responsibility.\n\nIf you want to consider going to this wedding and finding some compromise, I recommend the following. You can do this together with your brother if the two of you want. Type up a list of every command/request that she has made regarding her wedding. Send it to her to clarify that she still wants each of these things. Edit the list according to her response. Then send her one copy of the updated list and and two of your own lists. One of your lists should be include the things you are willing to do and pay for yourself, and the other list should include the things you are willing to do if she pays for them. \n\nI know this seems like a lot of work and may not be worth it to you. That\u2019s totally fine! I respect your desire to just not be involved in this relationship. I just wanted to provide that option for you as a possible way to make it work. \n\nIt\u2019s normal for brides/the couple to pay for things that they are requiring other people to do for their wedding. For example, in the last wedding I\u2019m in the bride included professional hair and markup for all her bridesmaids in her original budget. She said that it mattered to her for everyone to look equally polished in that way and therefore felt it was her responsibility to pay for those services. It was an extra request from a bride that some may have found excessive but since she did all the planning and payment, it instead came off as very kind and inclusive.", "NTA. Your sister is delusional and self-centered. Her demands are well beyond the bounds of reason and etiquette, you are not at all obligated to attend given them. \n\nIt really sounds like you would be happier having nothing to do with her. You\u2019re not a kid anymore, you have the power, and right, to choose who you have in your life. Do what\u2019s best for yourself, and don\u2019t sweat people who don\u2019t care about you.", "NTA. You\u2019re entirely correct, being invited to a wedding shouldn\u2019t come with a 4K bill.", "NTA. This would be beyond ridiculous even if you were close. Thank god you and your brother have each other.", "NTA. \n\nDon't attend. Save your money and sanity.

Money aside it sounds like you guys are family in blood only, she treats you and your brother terribly and is spoiled, why she wants you there is beyond me.

Comment stolen from u/little500HondaCBR", "INFO: Can you go to just the wedding as a normal guest and not the rest of the stuff? \n\nNTA, obviously, she\u2019s being weird. But I would still want to go.", "\"But this wedding\"?\n\nIs this not her first wedding?", "> Your sister seems to believe everyone.\n\nWhat?", "Match spawned in hell?", "Lol they\u2019ll be divorced in two years when they\u2019re financially ruined because they\u2019re trying to be something they\u2019re not.", "This is the way.", "That sucks but makes sense based off of everything else. You definitely are not the asshole for cutting jerks out of your life.", "Oh thanks. Somehow I missed this.", "Dear anyone out there. Please enable her brother to forever pull sitcom-style comedy plans when their sister wants something to do.", ">With her requirements, I\u2019m sure it will be a very very small wedding.\n\nI hope the groom turns up at least!!!\ud83d\ude02", "If everyone has to meet the same requirements, yes. Not to be cynical, but I suspect there might be some 'but I actually *like* you' discounts for some guests so that they actually attend and don't get annoyed about being milked.", "That sounds like how it should be, to me. However I recently missed a wedding because of the similar issues described by OP. There are delusion people out there who think you need to bleed yourself dry, financially, for the privilege of attendance. \n\nWhen in the end, it\u2019s just about them being entitled and self centered.  They focus on the money and optics of the wedding, instead of what\u2019s important:  the celebration of love and families coming together. \n\nSadly, these types of self centered weddings seem to break more relations than mend them. \n\nNTA", "Honestly I gotta save where I can", "I forgot Friendly\u2019s existed, and now I\u2019m thinking about the Monster Mash sundae which was always my favorite. Unfortunately there\u2019s none in my state so that\u2019s sad.", "Caption: Nothing is more important than family.", "That stuff she said to me and my brother is for the normal guests.", "Hey, they're doing everyone else a huge favor by taking each other out of the dating pool.", "The spawn, won't somebody think of the spawn?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "She never wanted to know better. She treated us badly and we weren't going to include her so that could continue.", "NTA Don't feel sorry for her. People this clueless will never suffer any pain of self-awareness. \n\nAll potential sources of criticism/judgement are 'jealous, wrong, disturbed, petty, stupid, fat, ugly, heathen, unchristian, godless, sinner, ungreatful, rebellious, and all the other names that narcissists use to reject other peoples opinions that might upset their 'I am right' world view.\n\nYou sound incredibly strong. Keep brave, you are managing this with great candor and elegance. You do you, girl!!!", "That\u2019s $8K, please. No such thing as a free wedding dinner. Not even for the groom.", "Oh wow. Is anyone going?", "It sounds like your mom is a narcissist, and your sister is a narcissist, but you and your brother aren't? Just throwing out a guess", "You didn't include the tip for the bride for looking awesome. 15k please!!!", ">Wonder if she's lost some friends over this, lol. \n\nkinda bold of you to presume she has *real* friends..."]}
