It\u2019s not your day. Why should you be out thousands of dollars and obey idiotic rules? Go and and maybe find something fun to do with your brother?", "NTA\n\nWow I really wasn\u2019t prepared for my own response here. Usually I\u2019m willing to cut brides a lot of slack. That ends when they tell someone to dye their hair for the wedding. Everything after that request got steadily worse. That price tag is absurd but I\u2019d be willing to look past it if you\u2019re all wealthy enough to regularly spend that much on a vacation. Caring about the cars you arrive him is so weird it sounds fake.\n\nI recommend watching some videos and reading more on narcissism. It seems like you might have done some of that already since you used the term \u201cgolden child\u201d but that can be general too so I thought I should add the recommendation anyway. I\u2019m sorry that your mother poisoned you and your brother\u2019s relationships with your sister by showing blatant favoritism and imbuing her with such an over-inflated sense of self. You should definitely not let your mother off the hook for her role in this monstrosity of an adult. That being said, your sister is an adult who\u2019s getting married and her delusional controlling behavior is her own responsibility.\n\nIf you want to consider going to this wedding and finding some compromise, I recommend the following. You can do this together with your brother if the two of you want. Type up a list of every command/request that she has made regarding her wedding. Send it to her to clarify that she still wants each of these things. Edit the list according to her response. Then send her one copy of the updated list and and two of your own lists. One of your lists should be include the things you are willing to do and pay for yourself, and the other list should include the things you are willing to do if she pays for them. \n\nI know this seems like a lot of work and may not be worth it to you. That\u2019s totally fine! I respect your desire to just not be involved in this relationship. I just wanted to provide that option for you as a possible way to make it work. \n\nIt\u2019s normal for brides/the couple to pay for things that they are requiring other people to do for their wedding. For example, in the last wedding I\u2019m in the bride included professional hair and markup for all her bridesmaids in her original budget. She said that it mattered to her for everyone to look equally polished in that way and therefore felt it was her responsibility to pay for those services. It was an extra request from a bride that some may have found excessive but since she did all the planning and payment, it instead came off as very kind and inclusive.", "NTA. Your sister is delusional and self-centered. Her demands are well beyond the bounds of reason and etiquette, you are not at all obligated to attend given them. \n\nIt really sounds like you would be happier having nothing to do with her. You\u2019re not a kid anymore, you have the power, and right, to choose who you have in your life. Do what\u2019s best for yourself, and don\u2019t sweat people who don\u2019t care about you.", "NTA. You\u2019re entirely correct, being invited to a wedding shouldn\u2019t come with a 4K bill.", "NTA. This would be beyond ridiculous even if you were close. Thank god you and your brother have each other.", "NTA. \n\nDon't attend. Save your money and sanity.

Then go LC or NC with her and mom. \n\nLove yourself and shed the toxicity. \n\n Best of luck!", "**NTA**\n\nThe posts about demands to change hair style (lenght, colour), dress code and dedicating ridiculous amount of time/energy/money for a wedding are dime a dozen in this sub.

Money aside it sounds like you guys are family in blood only, she treats you and your brother terribly and is spoiled, why she wants you there is beyond me. Secondly, telling people all of these instructions and requirements before they even display interest in your offer is just rude, you never agreed to being her bridesmaid or even to going to her wedding, so why is she telling you all of these details in the first place?

Yes it's her wedding, and she can have all these ideas of how she wants it to look, but that does not mean that everyone invited is going to put up with it. \n\nIf she really wanted her family involved for more than image, she would have factored that all into all of her plans.
