At least, that's what I thought because as soon as I got there everyone was rushing around saying I was gonna make them late. I was very confused until my dad told me they had a reservation at my stepmom's favorite restaurant and if we didn't make it there in 15 minutes they were going to cancel it. Edit: the exact text he sent me was \"Hey kiddo, do you want to come to my house for (stepmom's) birthday dinner?\" I even got her a present bc I thought the whole thing would be at his house\n\nI went along with them to this really fancy restaurant where everyone was dressed nice except for me. Apparently there were more people coming than I thought, including a lot of my stepmom's side of the family. So we all sat down and eventually got our food. After we were all done eating, our waitress asked how we wanted to split the check. My dad said he'd be paying for his wife and all his kids except me( I have three younger siblings). Everybody else would be paying separately.\n\nI tried to quietly tell my dad that I was pretty tight on money and that I wasn't expecting to eat out anywhere, let alone as nice of a restaurant that we were at. He said that was my problem and that I should have planned better (?). I told him I didn't even know we were going there, and he just said he didn't want to hear it. My stepmom very generously offered to pay, but my dad stopped her and said that as an adult I should be able to afford a single dinner. After that I just got up and walked out. I've been ignoring his calls ever since\n\nI'm less.mad and more embarrassed that I made a scene in front of my stepmom and her family. I just hope they'll forgive me eventually\n\nI admit I might have been wrong for assuming my dad would pay for me, but I didn't even know we were going to a restaurant in the first place so I feel like it's not really my fault.

I'm not familiar with the customs in your country, but in my opinion, if I invite someone, especially a family member, to my birthday, I should be responsible for covering the expenses. Your dad is a real AH, and I'm genuinely sorry that you had to go through such a terrible experience. Your father's inability to act like a decent person is the only thing that is shameful in this situation.", "NTA. It sounds like your dad set you up to embarrass you. Does he do things like this a lot?", "NTA. You were told dinner was at your father and stepmom's house, so you were underdressed and unprepared to go to a fancy restaurant. I would have assumed that if my family member invited me to dinner in either their home or in a restaurant they chose, that I would not be expected to pay.", "NTA. He invited you, failed to tell you full plan and expected you to pay at his wife\u2019s birthday dinner?! Also you are only 21\u2026 most people really aren\u2019t at fancy steakhouse dinner level at this age. I would have absolutely expected my parent to pay if I had been in this scenario. This was a very weird power play. Not sure what your typical relationship is with your dad but if this is normal (lack of communication/detail, embarrassing you in public, etc.) - maybe start to question if relationship is worth it.", "NTA Your dad did it intentionally, he\u2019s the AH", "NTA But your dad is.

Gender? Maybe they\u2019re all girls and he\u2019s being sexist towards you? Has he paid for food when y\u2019all go out in the past? Did you bring up at dinner that you didn\u2019t know this was the plan and it was a last minute change? I\u2019m just so confused how you ended up in this position.", "Info: did you order cheap?

You hope that her and her family understand why you were not better prepared for the evening. (2) Ask her if she has any insight into why your dad would not give you adequate information or notice AND act like you should have been prepared for everything that was sprung on you. Also ask her to remember that your dad/her husband will likely treat you the same way again and that you would appreciate it if she takes the time to let you know what the full plans are in advance.

I\u2019d be baffled if my parents did this to me at 21\u2026\n\nNTA for that and all the other reasons mentioned", "Yes this.  I was going to say similar.", "Why is that hard to understand? He doesn\u2019t live with them and he was only invited to dinner and told to come to their house.  Seems pretty obvious he was a reluctant invite and somewhat of an afterthought.", "I don't know, he literally just texted me saying \"hey kiddo, want to come to my house for (stepmom's) birthday dinner?\" And that was it", "I got one of the cheaper entrees and a water.", "If you expect your guests to pay, you at the VERY least need to let them know you\u2019re dining out instead of leading them to believe you\u2019re just having dinner at home.", "I don\u2019t know how responsible he is. Maybe there was a group text that he shouldn\u2019t have had on mute. Maybe there were 6 phone calls that he missed during the day. But 10+ people do not live in that house so I don\u2019t know how they all found out either. And like some one else said: how expensive did he order? If his siblings got chicken and he got an 18 ounce steak\u2026 \n\nThere were details needed for me to pass judgement. Cool that you felt you hand enough info to make a statement. I didnt. So I asked. \ud83d\ude04", "You were fine.  Nothing was your fault.   Nice of your stepmum to offer, so I hope you are ok there.", "So sorry to hear what you had to go through. Good on you for standing up for yourself. Unless they're rich, 21 year olds usually can't afford fancy restaurants, so he was just being mean to you. NTA", "Why are you the only person questioning that dad seems to have stuffed up.  If the original invite was to the house he invited op. If it was changed why did he not inform op. Never was it mentioned who invited the other people. Probably the step mum.  She gave the father 1 job. He couldn't be bothered doing it properly.  Then doubled down on op by embarrassing op.", "NTA he invited you out, so unless anything else was agreed Beforehand He should pay.", "NTA\nYour dad is not a good guy. Inviting someone, anyone, and not telling them the plan is to go to a fancy expensive restaurant is an AH move. Doing it to your own child is mean, stingy and kinda weird.\nHas he treated you like this before?", "NTA.\n\nI would contact the stepmom to apologize and explain all of the factors that led to your leaving, because I'm sure it's being portrayed as though you just didn't want to pay. She sounds like she understood your position and was trying to solve the problem. \n\nYour dad, on the other hand, treated you very poorly.\n\nYou should have been told about the restaurant, had it made clear you were expected to pay, and given the price range so you could either save money or decline. Those are just basic considerations for a dinner guest, let alone a family member.", "OP has a non-wicked stepmom. Yay for her."]}
