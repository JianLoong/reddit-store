If he only goes for a few hours so you guys can do a date that is fine. If you are in fact keeping him there for the entire day on Mondays you are only having one day off with your child which seems a little much to me. I personally could not only have one day off with my kids,however that is me. If in fact you keep him there all day Mondays, why not do the whole day occasionally for special dates? Other Mondays can be shorter dates, a couple hours, like a regular date. That way you could still have half a day together as a family. Your child is so young right now.

But every Monday?\n\nThere is some research that shows that children who spend above a certain number of hours a week in day care are more likely to have developmental delays and behavioral problems at home.  50+ hours a week in day care is a lot for a toddler.

Keep him home 1 day and get in hot water with school? Actually breaking the law by doing that in some states.\n\nI'm off Fridays and send my girls into daycare anyway.

Why have children if you don\u2019t want to be with them?", "NTA\n\nIm assuming you\u2019d be paying for Monday whether you use it or not.    \nSending the child to day care on Monday allows things like grocery shopping without a toddler  (because shopping with toddler take 10 times longer), medical visits, and adult time.  Nothing at all wrong with it.  You can have family time evening and on Sundays.  You can reevaluate every few months.", "NTA. I am a better mother because my kids go to daycare when I get my winter and summer breaks (I\u2019m in education). It\u2019s the only time I ever get to myself to purge rooms, deep clean or go have lunch with friends without a child with me. They love the structure and routine and get to be with their friends. We still have plenty of time together when daycare is closed and on the weekends. Don\u2019t feel bad!", "NTA. Your childcare arrangements are none of their business.", "YTA. Ever hear of family time? Geeze...", "NTA - I know a bunch of people that do that with their kids so they get kid free time to accomplish normal tasks.  If you can afford it - more power to you!", "NTA. I\u2019m a SAHM and I sent all my kids to daycare two days a week so that I had time for my own doctor appointments and could get stuff done without them home. I also take two of the kids to therapy during those days so it\u2019s really helpful with giving those kids the attention they need during therapy.\n\nHaving a day off to save your sanity is a good thing. Daycare is a good thing. just do the best with what you have.", "Why have a kid so others can raise ? \nETA.", "YTA!\n\nWhy did you have a child if you don't want to raise him?\n\nYour child needs bonding time with you. They grow so fast and are not little for long.  You are missing out on an important time with your child that you can never get back.\n\nYou remind me of a couple my niece used to babysit for. My niece works at a daycare/preschool where all the childrens' parents are scientists. She would babysit on the weekends outside of the daycare for this one couple almost every Saturday because they didn't want to change or adjust their fun couple time together. Sometimes they would even ask her to watch their baby on Sunday's too. This couple could have changed their lifestyle to accommodate their baby but they chose not to. They have a child but are still trying to act as if they do not. To this couple their childfree time was worth more to them than their family time. \n\nWhen you have a kid you need to learn to put them first. You sometimes have to make sacrifices for them and one of the biggest is giving up some me/couple time. Family bonding time is important. Children need their parents especially when they are young. Just remember when your child is cranky for you, doesn't want to listen to you, doesn't want to go to bed at bedtime, etc. you are the parent. Are you going to be a good parent or are you going to be the parent who has no idea how to handle a public tantrum, whose child won't listen, whose child acts up because they are craving attention and will seek it however they can get it?", "NTA it's not like your son is sitting in a room on his own all day, he's socialising with other kids. Nothing wrong with the two of you having a day off to yourselves, you'll probably appreciate the time you have with your son more if you have a break.

Those days are very much needed for my mental health. \n\nIf you can afford to have a kid free day and spend time together, go for it.", "NTA ever.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re not just parents, you\u2019re a husband and a wife too. The two of you absolutely need alone time for the sake of your marriage and your mental health. I understand why this arrangement works for you as it gives you this opportunity. \n\nHowever, 1.5yo is too young to spend 11 hours a day at a daycare imo (attachment, you know?). By the time your husband and your son get home and eat dinner, it\u2019s already time to prepare the child for sleep. There\u2019s hardly enough time to spend with him, talk about his day, play with him etc. If anything, I would try arranging things differently during the week (maybe you could pick up your son on your way home at 5 so you can spend more time with him? Or try to adjust work hours?). \n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with wanting to spend a few hours alone with your partner and/or run errands without the kid but you have a son who needs you more than anything. Where I\u2019m from, parent (usually mom) gets to stay with their children until the age of THREE because in those first three years children are the most dependent on their primary caregivers. It\u2019s actually based in developmental psychology. I get that it\u2019s not possible everywhere but try to get as much time with him as possible. Maybe you could leave him at daycare every other Monday for a few hours to have a date with your spouse and then spend rest of the day with your son? That way you keep your love alive and spend quality time with your son as well.", "NTA it\u2019s your family you do what\u2019s right for you.

Also, some kids thrive in daycare, can't wait to get there, some kids find it stressful. Only you know your kid.", "NTA. It's really hard running a household when both partners work full time (with or without kids, tbh). I'm guessing that on that Monday you can get a bunch of shit handled, especially errands to places closed on Sundays.

Totally normal mindset, lol!", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like a great way to keep your sanity, house (errands, cleaning) and marriage healthy.

If it possible for you to pick him up earlier than 6:30 each day? Right now it seems that you get off at 5pm could mean your son could be picked up earlier than 6:30 but it would inconvenience you.

Let them and just don't share anything else with them in the future. \n\nThere's a reason why I'm no longer involved with my s/o's family, and this is exactly it. If anybody has a problem with how I parent let me know, but if it's not an any way to lend a hand (I'm the type of person who will try anything before asking anybody for favors) then just stfu and stay out my way, because who even needs that?\n\nEspecially as a parent. I take care of my child. Everybody and everything else is just NOISE I cannot/will NOT deal with lol", "NTA.

I\u2019m not sure about where you live, but here to knock one day off barely saves any money either, especially when they are still quite young. If this option had been available when mine were young, I would have done the exact same thing.  Combining work and parenthood is hard - and can be especially hard on a marriage.

You are paying for m-f care. Using what you pay for is fine. \n\nMost daycares also do some educational activities, especially as the child gets older. The daycare my child(same age as yours OP) goes to has separate rooms/classes for each level. Infants, waddlers(my kids class), toddlers, threes(if potty trained fully, if not they stay in toddlers) and preschool 1 and 2. There is more education in the later classes, and those rooms have an actual teacher. \n\nI personally keep my little one home with me on random days off in the week, unless I have a lot of errands or appointments, or need a break. But those days I try not to feel guilty, because I know my little one is having fun with her friends and has access to learning materials from professionals versus me just trying to teach her abcs and numbers and colors at home(which we still do).", "INFO: Are the relatives bothering your husband as well, or only you? Because Mommy should be with the kid?", "NTA. It works for you. Also, they do realise he will be at school one day and will be in the same Monday to Friday routine he currently is in, so the transition will be smooth as silk for him.", "Lol it\u2019s not like he\u2019s not being taken care of. There is staff there who is supporting his development and he\u2019s getting quite a bit of socialization with other children and adults.  While parents should be the main caregivers, if you\u2019re running on fumes without that free Monday, you will not be able to care for your son to the best of your ability.

Equally choosing time away from child does not make you a bad parent.\n\nThere are a lot of comments about putting him in from 7:30 to 6:30 on a Monday, but it doesn't say this in the original post.

There's definitely a need to regroup and get rest time in order to be a good parent on all the other days so you are not TA for that.\n\nHowever, I never left kid on my day off for the same amount of time because I recognize that the kids need a break too. Remember that your young child is also getting up early every day, getting home late every night, and having to follow a strict schedule and rules in a place away from home during the 10-11 hours they are at daycare every day during the week. It's a lot for us adults, it is certainly a lot for our kids of any age!\n\nWhen I'd use daycare on off days we would often sleep in and I'd take kid closer to 9am. Then, I'd come home and rest a bit, get some chores done, and pick-up around 2-3 pm ready to enjoy an afternoon/evening with kid. There were certainly the occasional days where I did still leave kid for the 10 hours in order to get bigger projects and errands done but it was rare. So your family is also not TA here for trying to point this out.\n\nPractically, ask yourselves how your kid is doing and let this guide you. Does your kid frequently cry and break down in evenings and easily on weekends? Do they seem to just want to sleep and relax (maybe watch TV) all day on the weekend when home instead of being up and active and playing? Do they meltdown over little things with meltdowns that seem to last a very long time in comparison to what the meltdown is over? Do they seem able to learn when you teach topics or lessons or do they get frustrated easily when asked to think about anything?\n\nDon't get me wrong, at 1.5 a lot of these things are normal. However if it's super consistent and long-lasting this can be a sign of anxiety, exhaustion, and overstimulation meaning they are probably exhausted from their week at daycare and could use a bit more relaxing time with parents.", "That\u2019s so sad you\u2019d rather spend time Ruth your husband then your child.", "YTA\n\nI don't have much sympathy for super rich toffs, right? Because they tend to inflict harm on other people due to the positions within government they usually land in, because of networking with other super rich toffs who are in government, but one bit I do have sympathy for is when they say they didn't grow up with their parents, they were fobbed off into daycare and nannies and au pairs from a young age. And then they were in school all day. They had people who were paid to care about them more than other people in their life and they developed a deep sense of loneliness. \n\nIt wasn't just they didn't know their parents AS parents, but because school based bonds before a certain age are shallower than familial bonds - kids change schools, teachers and other staff are in and out of their lives, they don't have the freedom to socialise in familiar settings because they are just actual children still - it affects their ability to develop bonds as teenagers and adults. That's one of the things they have in common with children in care.\n\nYour child is in that situation that is affecting his development, without being the product of either of those family situations. And I'm not seeing anything in your post that says you make up for that outside of those hours. I mean, how can you really?

But that\u2019s not for a full day every week, at the expense of important bonding time with my young child. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is a bad person, I just think she\u2019s possibly a bit selfish for not wanting to include her child in her life more often. If you take into account the age of the child and bedtimes etc, he\u2019s getting one full day with his mom per week. Is that what most people envision when they plan to have a baby?", "And a lot of that sleeping is done...

Parents are not always the best educators, or best at teaching routines.  They also learn socialization and sharing with other kids.\n\nThe worst kids my daughter's age  (8) were the ones kept home and babied by their parents so they only think of themselves.", ">Not even remotely as much as the toddler's development. Don't have kids if you don't want to raise them.\n\nWhy do you think time with parents is the only or best way for a child to develop?  Why do you think kids being home away from other kids their age is the best way to develop?\n\nHint - it's not.\n\nMost(professional) daycares have trained and licensed caretakers that have often done schooling in education or child development.  They learn structure, sharing, socialization, counting , reading, and more.\n\nNot everyone is cut out to be an amazing parent the moment one is born.  I'm a software engineer, the fuck would I know about how and when to teach my kids colors or sing along songs?\n\n>Also the kid is putting in big shifts at the daycare. He's spending more time there than most people's full time jobs. 11 hrs a day :(\n\nWelcome to the modern working world of capitalism!  Spoiler alert for you -it doesn't get better as you age.\n\n>If you're a parent like this, you're just selfish. Muh MeNTal HeLTH, think of the kid ffs.
