I wish I was that quick thinking when someone is rude.", "NTA\n\nI mean people just snap sometimes. I am only envious about your skill of funny enough comeback, I can't do it in the right timing for the life of me.", "NTA, I used to be amazed that people that old that that poor of social skills, you'd think they'd learn a little in 50 years, but working at a store and the internet has disabused me of that.", "Going with NTA.  She got an attitude and then started making demands to you, a complete stranger.  She can sit and spin.", "NTA.   Good comeback", "NTA\n\nPeople are nosy and should mind their own business.  The way that lady spoke to you and asking you to cover your sons arm is down right rude and she deserved being snapped at.  \n\nSome people are ignorant and need calling out on it.", "NTA - there is nothing 'wrong' with your child, and people unpleasant enough to label difference as wrongness need to be put in their nasty little places. Tolerating bigotry for politeness sake is enabling it.", "Not at all. How very rude of her. I hope she looks for sympathy from her friends and family and they tell her she's an AH.\n\nPerhaps she'll think twice before sharing her unwanted opinions in future. NTA.", "NTA - Gross. That\u2019s terrible of her.", "You could make your son a little shirt that says 'Before you ask, I had a fight with a bear' or something. People are pretty rude asking medical questions of a total stranger, I'm sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA - You don't have to be polite to people who are being rude to you. Hopefully she will think twice about saying something like that to someone else in the future. \n\nWhat you said was totally fine, but I think the fact that you feel like you \"snapped\" rather than *decided* to respond that way is due to stress. Which is totally understandable! \n\nThe first 14 months of having a baby are stressful under any circumstances, but it sounds like your son had some serious medical complications at birth and then you had to learn how to manage the feeding tube alongside learning how to care for a newborn (assuming this is your first). Now you are dealing with stares and ignorant comments and even well meaning curious children - which is exhausting! *And I bet when your husband is the one out with your son he gets barely a fraction of the comments that you get.*  \n\nHave you looked into parent support groups? I think it would help you to have people (aside from just your husband) who can relate to the additional challenges you (and your son) will face - especially once your son gets old enough for school and other activities where you will have to advocate for his rights and needs.", "You ended her good lol.", "That woman was a major AH, but thank you for the whitty comeback!", "\n\nNo, you're not the AITA here. Your son has a right to exist in public without being treated as a spectacle or asked invasive questions. You should not have to endure ignorantly rude questions or comments and should not be made to feel guilty for defending him.", "NTA I would have said a lot worse. Who says that about a child!?", "NTA\n\nThat woman is entitled AH. If she can't stand looking a people with disabilities, she can stay home.", "NTA. \n\nI think it's good for your son to grow up seeing his parents take these things in stride and respond with such an appropriate and devastating response. \n\nGo OP!! Clap back with everything you have!", "Setting limits is setting a good example. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour kid is a kid, and entitled to exist just as any other kid does. F that crap barge of a human being. Tell your hubs your kid need fighters in his corner, and if he can't or won't.... Get behind you cuz you've got it covered.\n\nI drive school busses for both specialized and non-equipped schools. Specialized school mom's *are hands down, THE BEST*. Keep advocating for your kiddo.\n\nMuch love", "*So I asked her why she didn't cover her face for the same reason and walked away.*\n\nThe absolute burn!! That woman totally had it coming.

Rude people are rude for many reasons but one of them is because we allow them to be. There's no such thing as 'being the bigger person'. Everyone should stand up for themselves. If you ignore a rude person they don't think 'wow, this is such a mature person, I should be like this' they think 'wow this person is afraid of me and therefore avoiding me'. Stop giving morons power. Teach your kids to make nasty combacks. To raise their voices when someone is abusing them in public. NTA."]}
