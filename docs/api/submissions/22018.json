Rude people are rude for many reasons but one of them is because we allow them to be. There's no such thing as 'being the bigger person'. Everyone should stand up for themselves. If you ignore a rude person they don't think 'wow, this is such a mature person, I should be like this' they think 'wow this person is afraid of me and therefore avoiding me'.

You can\u2019t be nice all the time when people can be like that.", "I think it\u2019s good that your son saw his mom stick up for him. It\u2019s nice to know that when you can\u2019t stick up for yourself, someone else will. He may not understand yet but he is going to by maybe 3 or 4 so it\u2019s good I think", "Ugh. Some people are awful. NTA. My youngest son had terrible baby acne when he was born. It was head to toe and ear to ear, front and back. He was covered. It was simply a hormone purge and took time to clear, but people were just so mean. Even people I thought were good friends! Wrinkling their noses at this tiny helpless new human. I even slapped a lady in the store for poking at him one day. Keep sticking up for your child. People have forgotten how to simply be kind and can use the reminders, even the harsh ones.", "Nta.

He even plays in a hockey league, though I think he coaches now. \n\nBut how rude is it for an adult to come up and ask about your child! When did that become socially acceptable? I can see little children being curious and of course adults are curious too. But adults shouldn't  just go up to someone and start talking about your kid.", "NTA. Great comeback. Keep up the good work. \nAlso, I disagree with your partner. Your kid is gonna get shit his whole life. He needs to see how to handle it and that mom has his back.

I agree that rudeness isn't always the way but there are too many times in life where we prioritise manners over what needs to be said and that woman needed to be put in her place. \n\nNot that you need told, but there is nothing wrong with your son and he is perfect just the way he is.", "NTA - The kid's too young to remember this but that lady sure will, how dare she look down her nose at you and your child like that and good on you for standing up for you kid.", "NTA for sure. Your husband has a valid point that your child will learn from your example how to handle themselves and other people, and were there other ways to handle it? Sure. Does that make you the ass?  Nope, she still is.", "NTA!!  Your son will have to deal with this all his life.  He's likely to face bullying when he gets into school.  The way he sees you standing up for him now will translate into him being comfortable standing up for himself later, and to security in the knowledge that you will support him when he does so.  Bullies come in all sizes and ages, and I commend you for giving it right back to the one you encountered.", "NTA! I'm severely disfigured from a car accident and get SO sick of this shit. Wish I had a snappy comeback, so good on you. Mind your business people!", "It's an odd realization, but adults are really just children in bigger bodies. So, the way little kids react to new things? In that very nosy, invasive, inappropriate way? People don't grow out of that. Adults react the same exact way. They just run out of new things, so it becomes less and less frequent.\n\nIt's going to drive you absolutely insane and you'll want them to react and respond maturely, but they will default to the cruel curiosity of children.", "NTA but how is anyone supposed to educate themselves without first being exposed to something? If I just saw a kid at the store and wanted to educate myself on the disease, I first have to know what it is. Can't know that without asking or going through every single physical condition that affects children on the internet. You can't expect adults to know about a medical issue they've never heard of or seen before. You didn't know anything about it till your son got it and it's not some stranger in the stores job to know that or educate themselves on it. If you aren't a dr you shouldn't be expected to just know about birth defects. It's curiosity from adults too. Not just ignorance. Adults can also be curious. We just have the social skills to usually know better than to ask so rudely. She was the asshole here I just also don't feel like you should expect other people to educate themselves on some random kid they saw at the grocery store that they will probably never see again. It's not realistic. The fact that people expect adults to just know things is ridiculous. Life is based on experience and none of us experience it the same. \n\nYou can however expect them not to be rude. And to use better manners when asking or to not ask but that's never going to happen unfortunately. I wouldn't ask but that's just me. I would respect your privacy and just mind my business and shop but this isn't about me. I also have a lot of social anxiety so I mind my business in any situation lol. I spend the whole trip hoping people won't talk to me and do anything I can to avoid it including leaving the kids at home so old bitties don't try to talk to me about them. I'm working on it. You are NTA. I'm not saying you should do the same as me or even that I am even correct in how I'm handling it, just that that's how I handle it any time I can.", "And then let me guess- everyone started clapping?\n\nEveryone believes everything on this sub lol.", "\"No one has the right to talk about my son\"\n\nI think I'm going ESH.\n\nWe have free speech and people are going to talk about your son to your face, behind your back, kids are gonna be cruel.  It's up to you to decide what free speech you engage in. They are absolutely TA for using the free speech the way they did. You gotta be better than them.

My son literally looks like his great grandfather and great uncle, who have since passed away and he is their namesake since the uncle passed away before having kids and is named after his father.

I want cash, you want to get off,\" there's nothing *dishonest* about it. You can argue that it's distasteful, even immoral on the grounds that sex is meant to be an intimate act between committed people if that's what you feel.  But it's not dishonest - there's no deception there.\n\nSex means different things to different people. At 45 years old, I've had two sexual partners, one of them for the past more than 25 years. Obviously, for me sex is not a saleable service. I need love, and attraction, and some level of commitment, and I prefer it to be a gift shared. I also don't get professional massages because I prefer to not be touched by people I'm not emotionally familiar with. But plenty of people are happy to have casual sex, and plenty of people are willing to buy it, much like they would a massage. For them, it's a physical need being met and nothing more. As long as everyone is aware of the terms of sale, it's not any more dishonest than paying someone to perform any other physical service.\n\nNow, that being said - in many places prostitution is a horribly exploitative and dangerous position to be in.  But in that case, I still don't think it's the sex worker who should be disdained there so much as the sex buyer.
