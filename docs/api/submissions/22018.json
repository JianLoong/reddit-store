Rude people are rude for many reasons but one of them is because we allow them to be. There's no such thing as 'being the bigger person'. Everyone should stand up for themselves. If you ignore a rude person they don't think 'wow, this is such a mature person, I should be like this' they think 'wow this person is afraid of me and therefore avoiding me'.

Some people are awful. NTA. My youngest son had terrible baby acne when he was born. It was head to toe and ear to ear, front and back. He was covered. It was simply a hormone purge and took time to clear, but people were just so mean. Even people I thought were good friends! Wrinkling their noses at this tiny helpless new human. I even slapped a lady in the store for poking at him one day. Keep sticking up for your child. People have forgotten how to simply be kind and can use the reminders, even the harsh ones.", "Nta.

I can see little children being curious and of course adults are curious too. But adults shouldn't  just go up to someone and start talking about your kid.", "NTA. Great comeback. Keep up the good work. \nAlso, I disagree with your partner. Your kid is gonna get shit his whole life. He needs to see how to handle it and that mom has his back.

Your husband has a valid point that your child will learn from your example how to handle themselves and other people, and were there other ways to handle it? Sure. Does that make you the ass?  Nope, she still is.", "NTA!!  Your son will have to deal with this all his life.  He's likely to face bullying when he gets into school.  The way he sees you standing up for him now will translate into him being comfortable standing up for himself later, and to security in the knowledge that you will support him when he does so.  Bullies come in all sizes and ages, and I commend you for giving it right back to the one you encountered.", "NTA! I'm severely disfigured from a car accident and get SO sick of this shit. Wish I had a snappy comeback, so good on you. Mind your business people!", "It's an odd realization, but adults are really just children in bigger bodies. So, the way little kids react to new things? In that very nosy, invasive, inappropriate way? People don't grow out of that. Adults react the same exact way. They just run out of new things, so it becomes less and less frequent.\n\nIt's going to drive you absolutely insane and you'll want them to react and respond maturely, but they will default to the cruel curiosity of children.", "NTA but how is anyone supposed to educate themselves without first being exposed to something? If I just saw a kid at the store and wanted to educate myself on the disease, I first have to know what it is. Can't know that without asking or going through every single physical condition that affects children on the internet. You can't expect adults to know about a medical issue they've never heard of or seen before. You didn't know anything about it till your son got it and it's not some stranger in the stores job to know that or educate themselves on it. If you aren't a dr you shouldn't be expected to just know about birth defects. It's curiosity from adults too. Not just ignorance. Adults can also be curious. We just have the social skills to usually know better than to ask so rudely. She was the asshole here I just also don't feel like you should expect other people to educate themselves on some random kid they saw at the grocery store that they will probably never see again. It's not realistic. The fact that people expect adults to just know things is ridiculous. Life is based on experience and none of us experience it the same. \n\nYou can however expect them not to be rude. And to use better manners when asking or to not ask but that's never going to happen unfortunately. I wouldn't ask but that's just me. I would respect your privacy and just mind my business and shop but this isn't about me. I also have a lot of social anxiety so I mind my business in any situation lol. I spend the whole trip hoping people won't talk to me and do anything I can to avoid it including leaving the kids at home so old bitties don't try to talk to me about them. I'm working on it. You are NTA. I'm not saying you should do the same as me or even that I am even correct in how I'm handling it, just that that's how I handle it any time I can.", "And then let me guess- everyone started clapping?\n\nEveryone believes everything on this sub lol.", "\"No one has the right to talk about my son\"\n\nI think I'm going ESH.\n\nWe have free speech and people are going to talk about your son to your face, behind your back, kids are gonna be cruel.  It's up to you to decide what free speech you engage in. They are absolutely TA for using the free speech the way they did. You gotta be better than them.

I also don't get professional massages because I prefer to not be touched by people I'm not emotionally familiar with. But plenty of people are happy to have casual sex, and plenty of people are willing to buy it, much like they would a massage. For them, it's a physical need being met and nothing more. As long as everyone is aware of the terms of sale, it's not any more dishonest than paying someone to perform any other physical service.\n\nNow, that being said - in many places prostitution is a horribly exploitative and dangerous position to be in.

Maybe the lady at the store was being rude and uppity or maybe she could come here a write her side and be just as justified we don't know. It's all how OP perceived it. \n\n I get that I'm not Shelf stable some times but I also don't expect random people to put forth initiative to be an educated individual on things that don't apply to them or their life before speaking to me. I would go insane. I\n\nTLDR: You don't wanna educate people, don't. Just don't expect everyone to know stuff you haven't told them when it comes to your life. Google doesn't always give the right answer...", "I love the one where my grandfather making fun of my stomach asked me when my baby was due. I told him months after yours and he almost fell off his chair laughing. He never gave me a hard time again.", "Me too. When I was expecting my oldest kid, one lady asked me if I\u2019m having twins and I shot back, \u201c no do you need glasses?\u201d. That shut her up!", "Bernard can help you with that.", "Or an AI app that sends clever comebacks via Bluetooth. Like, when Siri interrupts your jam with \u201cText from Matt. Matt texted, can you come upstairs and look at this thing on my butt.\u201d \n\nI have no idea how to build an app but no one steal my idea!!", "That's what I came here to say!", "No, should be \u201cwhat are you looking at moron?\u201d", "I love this!", "I know someone who lost some flesh on her arm to an infection, but sometimes just deadpans that it was from a crocodile attack or Olympic skiing accident.", "Oh I love this!!!!", "Lol, people with feeding tubes, but you can get tubie teletubie tube covers. Tubie tounge twisters", "I understand both parents' perspectives here. TeChNiCaLlY the husband is right, it's a morally better choice to take the high road and be the bigger person and whatnot. \n\nBUT he may not take their son out in public as often as OP, so he may not be able to fully comprehend just how emotionally draining the constant comments are - especially when they're about your own child. \n\nHe'll almost certainly experience losing his cool in a similar experience at some point. He may not have gotten there yet, but he definitely could have supported OP more here, since she'd definitely hit her limit for BS that day. \n\nAnd you're absolutely right, when you're at your limit, I think it's far better to be rude to the bigot than to allow your child to suffer thru the ignorant comments without the support of their parent. NTA !", "The only Bible I ever read was a children's bible but I'm fairly certain that it's full of tales of a vengeful God. Some Christians want that type of payback for perceived sins. I think some revel in it.", "Adults should understand that asking about things that are absolutely none of their business is rude.", "I had an elderly lady once ask if I was ok if she asked me a question about his arm, when is phrased like that I don't mind because it gives me the chance to back out if I dont want to talk about it. \n\nI'd rather no one asked about it, because as far as I'm concerned he's not different. That's his arm, it's his normal. However I know that's not realistic and people will ask but the way its asked is really important.", "The issue wasn\u2019t the inquiry itself, it was saying a toddler is *unsightly*. You asked \u201cignorance of *what* exactly?\u201d\n\nManners.", "It does not mean for him of consequences. There might not be legal consequences to the things you say, but there are definitely societal consequences. Meaning people will respond in a way you don't like, or you might get shunned from your community.", "This mentality always bothered me. Why is it on others to deal with my ignorance? If they want to talk, I'll listen. If I have accomodate, I'll ask. Otherwise just let them be, they have their own stuff to deal with.", "Sams. It is really tiring", "Rude people never had consequences for their behaviors in their lives as well as repercussions. \nTheir behavior was never reinforced or corrected. I defo DO NOT stand for rudeness anywhere anymore. Some rude folks are so awful that when you ignore them, they will follow and berate possibly becoming a threat or danger to those around them.", "It absolutely is full of angry, vengeful god scenarios. My point is that most xians claim that their god is loving, benevolent, and caring and what that person was telling you flies in the face of that.", "There\u2019s this amazing children\u2019s book called \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d By James Catchpole.

I am only envious about your skill of funny enough comeback, I can't do it in the right timing for the life of me.", "People loveee to assume that because you or someone you know has a disability/illness, you\u2019re now solely responsible for educating them on everything related to said disability/illness.", "Kids need to get to know different people. \n\nWhen I was a kid I met a man like Op's son, and I thought \"Huh that's weird\" but keep listening to the man talking at a party.\n\nAlso knew a man who was know as \"Devil's hands\". He was blind. He was funny.\n\nThe only person who scared me was a old man. But he has a HOOK with cables coming out of it!\n\nHow is that adults can be worse than kids about things like this?
