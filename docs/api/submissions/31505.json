Only two of these bedrooms have bathrooms. The largest one of this will be my wife and I's, of course. And the second largest room without bathroom will go to our youngest daughters who agreed to share a bedroom. Now, there's the third largest room with a bathroom and the fourth room left. My oldest daughter asked if she could have the one left with a bathroom, and I said no since this would be her grandma's (my mother's) room if she ever came to stay with us. My eldest didn't say anything but seemed sad about it, which I thought was just bratty behavior. \n\nNow, she told her sisters about this when they asked why was she staying in the smallest room of the house when there's a larger one available. Apparently, she told them that I said she couldn't have it since it was their grandma's. Now my youngest daughters have come to ask if grandma was moving in with us and I had to explain to them that, no, grandma is not moving in with us but we must prepare and keep that room with her if she ever wanted to (I'm her middle son, she lives with my younger brother but I want to have a room available for her.)\n\nMy youngest pointed out that grandma never stayed with us in our old house and rarely even visited us even though she lives close. I argued that since I'm the owner of this house, I get to decide which rooms they're taking and that the one with the bathroom should be left for their grandma. My daughters seemed to agree and I thought that was the end of it.\n\nBut just a moment ago, I overheard my youngest two comforting the oldest crying, which is quite bratty of her. She must be grateful she even has a roof over her head and that I allowed her to live with me even though she's an adult now. I started arguing with her about it, to which she grunted that I never treated her as my daughter and that I'm a \"simp for grandma\" since I do everything my mother asks me to, because well, I'm her soon.\n\nIn the end, I told her that she could either take the last room available or nothing at all. She told her grandparents (maternal) and uncles (paternal, my brothers) and now they're are telling me that I'm an asshole for not giving my daughter something as simple as a room.\n\nSo, strangers of the Internet, am I the asshole for not letting my daughter get the room she wanted?", "created_utc": 1700661367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1819oge/aita_for_not_giving_my_eldest_daughter_the_room/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah, YTA.  You\u2019re telling your child that she matters less than an apparently very unlikely possibility of someone else needing what she wants.\n\nA much more reasonable compromise is to let her have the better room, but tell her that if your mother comes to live with you, she\u2019s going to have to agree to move into the last bedroom.  That way, she gets to enjoy the room as long as your mother doesn\u2019t need it, but everyone understands that your mother will get it if she needs it.", "This whole post is dripping with poison and condescension. Do you actually hate your daughter? I rarely see people post with such hatred and disregard for another person's feelings, even for people who aren't in their family. There is not a single sentence of love, compassion, or support in your entire post. You seem disgusted that she dares to even have feelings at all.  Really a terrifying picture of what it's like to have you as a father.\n\nTo the issue: You're denying a room from someone who could use it, to hold it for someone who will never use it - Of course you're an asshole. And worse, you seem to be a petty and hateful person.\n\nAs a parent you are supposed to put your children first, and care for them above all. Your daughter is right that you probably have never done that, because you think they are 'entitled' for asking for fair and equal treatment. Because you think they are 'bratty' for having perfectly normal hurt feelings. \n\nMy guess is that you aren't a good person, and you don't have a good relationship with your kids. They all seem pretty united in the fact that you aren't a caring or loving father. So my bet is you will be gradually losing touch with them as they get older and are free to distance themselves from you. I bet emotionally they've already begun.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nYour child isn\u2019t being bratty, they\u2019re just smart enough to see through your BS. Look we all have aging parents, and we all want to be in situations to care for them when the time comes, but that glosses over several things in your story: \n\n1. This would put an entire bathroom out of commission (in essence) indefinitely. There is zero reason grandma can\u2019t have a smaller room without a bathroom if she\u2019s only staying once a year or less. \n2. There has been zero discussion of grandma moving in, you\u2019re punishing your daughter for calling you out on that. \n3. Grandma already has a place to live with family!!!! And it\u2019s not with you. Have you never met an old person before? They don\u2019t like moving houses much. \n4. \u201cYou can take the last room available or nothing at all\u201d-really? Making threats you legally can\u2019t carry out? That\u2019s some extra AH behavior.", "So what did your daughter do that angered you so much? You very clearly are angry with her. \n\nLet me repeat what your reason is. \nShe can't have the 3rd bedroom because your mother might, sometime in the future, decide to move in with you even tho she already lives with your brother, rarely comes over for a visit, and has never expressed a desire to live with you, but just in case, because you never know.\n\nYour daughter expresses disappointment, and you call her a brat. She is crying because she KNOWS you're angry and punishing her, and you say she should be grateful.\n\nThis isn't about the bedroom, this is about why you are angry with her.

Get off the tit dude. You have enough bedrooms for each kid to have their own room but you deprive *all* of them from that to accommodate your mother on nothing more than a possibility. If my son was as big of an asshole as you then I\u2019d rarely visit him either. \n\nHope you\u2019re not depending on your kids taking care of you when you\u2019re too old to wipe your own ass because I doubt you\u2019d have so much as a couch to sleep on in their homes. \n\nYTA and so is your wife if she just sits back and lets this stupid shit slide.", "This reads like a writing exercise from a writing prompt. \"Write something as if you were a completely obvious A-hole.

The room will be empty the vast majority of the time.  You could also just tell her IF your mother ever comes to stay/live, then she changes rooms at that point.  Also, why would you make your other girls share a room when you have an open room?!  Pretending as though your mom lives with you when she actually lives with your brother is weird - and I\u2019m sure your daughters think it\u2019s weird too.  It\u2019s your house, so yes, you get to decide.  That doesn\u2019t make you right.", "YTA.\n\nWhat on earth have you got against your daughter? This post is so bizarre; it reads like you're trying to punish her for daring to exist.\n\n'My eldest didn't say anything but seemed sad about it, which I thought was just bratty behavior.'\n\nSo...she can't have emotions? You think she's a brat because, like a literal human, she experiences sadness and this shows on her face?", "Sure. It's your house and your rules.\n\nBut that rules makes you an asshole. Your mom doesn't live with you, and there are no plans to her moving in anytime soon. Why wouldn't you let your kid live in a better room if it's available ?! \n\nYTA. Of course your daughter is distraught. You are dismissing her in favour of a scenario that might never happen.", "YTA. If grandma stayed with you frequently I would understand, but she lives with your brother, and there\u2019s nothing in your post saying that plans on changing. You could always give your daughter the bigger room with the condition that she relinquish it to grandma if necessary. Since she\u2019s a young adult, chances are that she won\u2019t be staying with you for much longer. Your attitude of denigrating your daughter for her feelings makes me sick.", "YTA. \n\nRegardless of how inane I think your logic is, there was no need to make your child cry and to argue in with her about this. I don't think she was being bratty by being hurt at how you went after her.\n\nYour home should be a safe and soft place for your children. \n\nI can appreciate that this room is being held for your mother but that's not even something that is in motion. It would have been just as easy to speak with your daughter about using her room as the guest bedroom for when Grandma visits, or if Grandma did want to move in, then she would need to move to the smaller room.", "What you're doing isn't rational or logical.  It sounds spiteful in fact. If your mother needs to stay with you you could ask that your daughter switch to the other room while she stays with you but to leave it sitting empty is nonsense.", "YTA. Being sad isn\u2019t bratty. Being sad is just being sad. Which was understandable in this situation because your decision sounds illogical with the details you\u2019ve given.", "YTA\n\nWhile I certainly agree that, as the owner of the house, you get to decide who goes in which room, that doesn't mean you're not an asshole when you decide it in an arbitrary and cruel manner.\n\nYou're an asshole simply for (twice) describing your daughter's behavior as \"bratty\" when all she's doing is *being sad* about it. If she was back-talking or sassy about it to you, you never mentioned it in your post. She just 1. \"seemed sad\" and 2. cried to her sisters, not to you.\n\nFrankly, I have no idea why you would make two children share a room, and give your other daughter the smallest room, simply to keep the second-best bedroom as a guest room for a guest who's never even stayed at your house before and is not moving in.\n\nI would give your eldest daughter the bedroom with the en-suite, on the condition that when (and if) your mother comes to visit, she has to give up her room to your mother. Then I'd give your other daughters each their own room. Make sure the larger room has a second bed or trundle bed or something, so your eldest is comfortable when (and if) she needs to stay there too.", "She is allowed to be sad about not being able to have a large room.

In this situation, it seems like there may be some miscommunication and hurt feelings on both sides.\r  \n\r  \nYour desire to keep a room available for your mother is understandable, but it's also crucial to consider your daughter's feelings and needs. It's possible that she perceives this decision as favoritism or as a reflection of her not being valued as much as her siblings.\n\nIt's not about whether you have the right to make decisions about your home, but rather how these decisions impact the dynamics and relationships within your family. It's important to strive for a resolution that considers everyone's feelings and needs.", "YTA I\u2019m sorry your mother prefers your siblings, but you\u2019re acting delusional here.

But if it isn't. YTA. A big one. While you're bucking for son of the year to someone that doesn't even visit you, you're losing at being a good father. Are you even kind to her beyond providing a roof over her head? If your mother lives close by, why would she ever stay the night? \n\nAnyway, I still think this is fake.", "YTA The only bratty poor behavior in your post is all from you.  You are letting a bathroom go completely unused because someday your mother \u201cmight\u201d use it?? The guest room should be the smallest in the house.

If circumstances change and your mother needs it, then you can reassess later. It's stupid to keep it open indefinitely.", "YTA\n\nOf course it\u2019s your house and you make the rules, but there are so many better ways about this.

That way she\u2019s prepared to give the room up in the event that she needs to, but still gets to enjoy it most of the time.\n\nDespite that, I was still inclined to say you\u2019re not the A on principle - after all, your house your rules and it\u2019s not for me to dictate how you raise your kids, even if I think there\u2019s a way better solution.  The main reason you\u2019re the A is the way you talk about your kids - you seem to dismiss any behaviour you dislike, including simply being upset, as \u201cbrattiness\u201d and make no attempt to understand their position, you just dictate that they have to do things your way or get out.  You\u2019re treating your eldest as a burden that you\u2019re kind enough to begrudgingly deal with until she gets out - with that attitude, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re the one left sad when she does move on and cuts you out of her life.", "Wow, and I thought MY dad was an AH when I was a kid.

Only two of these bedrooms have bathrooms. The largest one of this will be my wife and I's, of course. And the second largest room without bathroom will go to our youngest daughters who agreed to share a bedroom. Now, there's the third largest room with a bathroom and the fourth room left. My oldest daughter asked if she could have the one left with a bathroom, and I said no since this would be her grandma's (my mother's) room if she ever came to stay with us. My eldest didn't say anything but seemed sad about it, which I thought was just bratty behavior. \n\nNow, she told her sisters about this when they asked why was she staying in the smallest room of the house when there's a larger one available. Apparently, she told them that I said she couldn't have it since it was their grandma's. Now my youngest daughters have come to ask if grandma was moving in with us and I had to explain to them that, no, grandma is not moving in with us but we must prepare and keep that room with her if she ever wanted to (I'm her middle son, she lives with my younger brother but I want to have a room available for her.)\n\nMy youngest pointed out that grandma never stayed with us in our old house and rarely even visited us even though she lives close. I argued that since I'm the owner of this house, I get to decide which rooms they're taking and that the one with the bathroom should be left for their grandma. My daughters seemed to agree and I thought that was the end of it.\n\nBut just a moment ago, I overheard my youngest two comforting the oldest crying, which is quite bratty of her. She must be grateful she even has a roof over her head and that I allowed her to live with me even though she's an adult now. I started arguing with her about it, to which she grunted that I never treated her as my daughter and that I'm a \"simp for grandma\" since I do everything my mother asks me to, because well, I'm her soon.\n\nIn the end, I told her that she could either take the last room available or nothing at all. She told her grandparents (maternal) and uncles (paternal, my brothers) and now they're are telling me that I'm an asshole for not giving my daughter something as simple as a room.\n\nSo, strangers of the Internet, am I the asshole for not letting my daughter get the room she wanted?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My room doubled as the guest room. It was made up a little fancier than I think I might have liked, but it worked well enough for short-term visits that I would get an air mattress on my sisters floor or the couch downstairs. The guest space should be the lower quality of room, if theres any extras, I think, especially if the grandmother doesn't visit often and lives close. \n\nI agree OP yta. He seems very bitter about this daughter. In addition to the step child speculation put there I wonder if she was born when he was young and not ready to parent mayve? Since all we know about any of the chores ages is that she's an adult.", "I\u2019m the same age as OP and and he\u2019s definitely TA. Room with a bathroom just sitting empty just in case his mom wants to come live there? Ridiculous.

She probably helped make him this delusional.", "Honestly I might be pulling stuff out of my ass but it seems like he isn\u2019t Grandma\u2019s favorite (she lives with another family member, is close by but never visits or stays over) and so he resents his own children for\u2026being children. \n\nHe probably has always done things in hopes of getting his mother to favor him and it\u2019s clearly not worked.

How dare she think she can just ASK for things!", "I'm not defending them in any way, but there are often times this happens for various reasons.

And I never use my kitchen in case Gordon Ramsay rings my doorbell and needs to urgently cook.", "Exactly, it is important to consider everyone's feelings", "I don't know. He mentions the daughter is an adult. So I'm thinking this could be the daughter of one of OPs past relationships when he was younger and not with his current wife.

As if it's the child's fault they were born too early.", "Honestly, if something went so magnificently tits up in the 70yr olds life and the 90yr old parent had the capacity to put a roof over their head, I believe they should do it.\n\nMy issue with OP is this, he acts like his daughter should be grateful and that she is lucky OP does anything for them at all, and keeps calling the daughter a brat.

When I was younger, everytime my grandma came to visit (and she was a 5 hour flight away), she would stay in my room and I would stay in my sisters room with her.

I bet grandma just doesn't talk much to this side of the family, probably to avoid OP.", "I could understand this take if the youngest hadn\u2019t called OP out and said grandma never stayed and hardly visits.

I just know enough kids who decided the like sharing enough that that part didn\u2019t seem weird to me. Just the way he\u2019s so condescending and terrible to his oldest daughter.", "Pfft. Like he'll ever show up... but still. Better to not let anyone else in there", "I was thinking this, too.  \n\n\nOP says daughter is an adult, and he's in his 40s, so it tracks: maybe having a child to support in his late teens/early 20s was \"hard on him\" (Teen guys! Use condoms!) and so he never really loved this daughter?  \n\n\nAnd it seems to me that Grandma has his number: she's living with his brother and never comes to visit.  \n\n\nOver and above all this, I think it's interesting that his younger daughters seem to have a good relationship with the eldest, so my guess is that they, too, know just how much of an AH he is, and will, like this older girl, bail as soon as they can. They'll all three be deciding on your geriatric care together one day, and I would bet dollars to donuts that you won't be getting much in the way of high-priced, empathetic, luxury living.", "Because he\u2019s a brat.", "Good point", "Maybe in that spare bathroom?", "That was my first thought.

Unless the amount of bedrooms needed for permanent residents is less than the amount of bedrooms with dedicated bathrooms, in which case the guest room having a dedicated bathroom has no affect on the permanent residents. \n\nSo to answer your general question without applying it to the post, it entirely depends on a variety of factors in the specific situation, and boiling it down to simple A/B options with no room to consider those factors is disingenuous and can't tell you \"what kind of person\" someone is.", "Given the tone, she isn't even a legal adult yet.
