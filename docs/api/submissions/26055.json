Then in college, I got into Jewish history and started thinking about my name. Traditionally, Jews don't have an English name and then get a Hebrew name stacked onto it -- they're named originally in Hebrew, and then they usually get an English name to use among gentiles, because most Hebrew names aren't very familiar (or pronounceable) to gentiles. \n\nBut my Hebrew name happened to be one that is also used in American gentile culture, just as it is, with no changes in pronunciation or anything. So it's not unfamiliar, let alone unpronounceable, to anybody who grew up speaking English.
