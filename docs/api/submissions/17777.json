But I've been growing increasingly more resentful, and I really feel that the gym is more of a hobby for him and more for the goal of building his body (he mostly does weightlifting, not cardio) and he just uses health as an excuse to make me feel guilty for being a bad wife who doesn't care about his health.

Also - I am all for people having hobbies, and working on themselves outside of their relationships\u2026 but this gave me OVERWHELMING \u201che\u2019s having an affair\u201d vibes. Everyone I know with a band they practice with, or community theater rehearsals, or a spiritual practice, or a lot of friends - whatever big Stuff that\u2019s not part of their romantic relationship - they aren\u2019t constantly defensive and totally rigid *about* their Stuff. They\u2019re not using manipulative, \u201cturn it around on you\u201d tactics when questioned. And, they\u2019re freaking flexible, all of them to some point, even when others are counting on them. I may also just be touchy about someone going so far for their gym, and/or always needing to take a 30 minute shower after they walk in the door? But like. I dunno man.

This is about him not pulling his weight around the house and deprioritizing your relationship. \n\nHe\u2019s counting on you to pick up the slack. \n\nYou don\u2019t mention having kids, so here\u2019s my advice:\n\nStop overcompensating for his lack of care and attention to your home and your relationship. \n\nSit down and write out everything that needs to happen to keep your home and lives running aside from both of your working. Estimate times for all of it. Tell him that you are not going to bitch about the gym anymore, but you have been doing the bulk of the work- show him the list and explain that you will not be doing more than half anymore. \n\n**Now stop doing more than half.** Then take 2 hours a day and go enjoy your summer. Find something to do that you love. \n\nWhen he bitches about stuff it being done, simply remind him you are doing your share and he needs to handle it. When he bitches about you being unavailable, ask him if he wants to plan a date night with you. \n\nYour husband needs to step up. But he needs to experience the gaps you have before he can recognize them.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m just going to toss this to think about. My brother did the same thing.5 days/week. Always the same time. Lots of hours. Refused to alter his schedule, etc.  \n\nHe was cheating on my ex sister in law and this was how he arranged it. He left his cellphone out one day Egan he was \u201clate\u201d and the AP sent a text. \n\nJust do a bit of quiet investigating if this raises a flag.", "You are absolutely, unequivocally NTA.\n\nBut he's being a huge, selfish one.\n\n>He says it's really not that much time at the gym. \n\nOkay, well we know that that is objectively untrue, by like a mile, and here's your proof:\n\n>I find myself having to pick up a lot of the slack around the house and taking care of chores, errands, and responsibilities because he just doesn't have the time in the day. I find myself hardly sleeping, and I can never find the time to work out myself because I just feel so overwhelmed with everything I have to take care of outside of work. If I need him to take care of something a certain day and it conflicts with his gym schedule, it's always a hard \"no\". If I ask him to do take care of things a lot of the time, he just won't have time to do it between work and the gym. \n\nIf you are being left with the bulk of the housework, errands, and household responsibilities, to the point where you are stressed and overwhelmed by how much you're having to handle, then he is already very obviously going to the gym too much, because if he weren't, you wouldn't be having to handle his share of the household responsibilities.\n\nThe fact that he openly states that he \"doesn't have time\" to do chores, errands, etc. because it \"conflicts with his gym schedule\" or he \"doesn't have time between work and the gym\" is him *literally saying that he is spending so much time at the gym that he does not have time to do household things*. Which means that he is spending too much time at the gym, because working out isn't a responsibility, it is a privilege and something that he enjoys . . . but doing his share of taking care of the household that you BOTH live in is, in fact, a responsibility. And it is as much his responsibility as it is yours.\n\n>If I ask him to not go a day because I need his help, he makes me feel extremely guilty because he frames it as me not caring about his health, because going to the gym is ultimately for his health and well-being, \n\nPlease don't feel guilty. Seriously, there is literally no reason for you to feel any guilt at all for asking him to cut back, because:\n\nFirst of all, because he's full of shit. There is not a doctor in the world who will agree that he needs to go to the gym as often as he is, or work out for as many hours as he does, in order to be healthy. What he is doing is not for his \"health and well-being\". The type of training he's doing is exactly that: training. He's sculpting his body. He can very easily do probably half of what he does and still be doing plenty of exercise for optimal health. \n\nSecondly, don't feel guilty because once again, he's showing his arse. He's trying to make you feel guilty about interfering with \"his health and well\" being while basically admitting openly that he doesn't give a shit about YOUR health and well-being. Why is he more important than you in this relationship? Why is the priority that he gets to go exercise this often if it literally means that it is causing you stress, anxiety, and physical exhaustion, all of which are terrible for YOUR health? I'd suggest asking him why your health doesn't matter at all in this equation.\n\n>and he says he'll be more well-rested and more able to help me out if he goes to the gym. \n\nExcept that again, that's a bald-faced lie, because he's been going to the gym this often for all this time and it has not, in fact, been the impetus for him to be more helpful. It has been the opposite. \n\nI don't usually believe in ultimatums, but this is definitely the time for one. He's being boldly selfish, cares only about himself, and isn't pulling his weight at home at all, and is excusing it with obvious bullshit. You are NTA, but he doesn't care.

I spend a few hours at the gym 4-5 days per week (although that's cardio and weights) and I also get annoyed anytime something comes up to interfere with my routine. Some people may view it as an addiction, and I kinda get why. But the gym **is** important to me. Part of that is health. Part of it is seeing the physical transformation that has happened and not wanting to lose that. Yet another part is that working out has become therapeutic for me. The gym is a place where I can go to clear my head for a few hours every day.

If you are asking your husband to skip workouts for things that could be done the 2 days he isn't working out, you are the one not being flexible.\n\nHonestly, when I was in my 20s and newly married I would spend 2 hours a day in the gym 7 days a week. It was never an issue in my marriage. I would skip days sometimes but on average/week I would probably spend more time than your husband.

The amount of the time at the gym isnt the problem, its normal to take longer to include rest as well as having to wait at times for other people to finish what you are looking to start, its the consistency and resistance to change. It changes from being a passion to an obsession when it interferes with his life and more importantly yours, without a choice. What bothers me the most here is that your health is being neglected by him AND yourself because he is prioritizing a \u201chealthier\u201d lifestyle for him and only him. Yes it is completely his choice if he chooses the gym over a social life but this sounds like he is also choosing it over day-to-day life necessities which fall back on you, creating double the work load on top of your career and personal concerns. Your health is being compromised by losing sleep and struggling to find time to even go to the gym yourself let alone for self care, hes being narcissistic. TBH I\u2019d stop doing everything for him and only do what is necessary for you, you need to prioritize your health since he obviously is only interested in his own. Him not changing his actions in the slightest, or even finding compromise like a change to a closer gym or only one shower a day, is a huge red flag to me personally. He said you are being crazy for asking him to deprioritize his health, next time throw it back on him that hes being worse by always asking to only prioritize his which deprioritizes your own.
