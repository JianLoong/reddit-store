But I've been growing increasingly more resentful, and I really feel that the gym is more of a hobby for him and more for the goal of building his body (he mostly does weightlifting, not cardio) and he just uses health as an excuse to make me feel guilty for being a bad wife who doesn't care about his health.

Also - I am all for people having hobbies, and working on themselves outside of their relationships\u2026 but this gave me OVERWHELMING \u201che\u2019s having an affair\u201d vibes. Everyone I know with a band they practice with, or community theater rehearsals, or a spiritual practice, or a lot of friends - whatever big Stuff that\u2019s not part of their romantic relationship - they aren\u2019t constantly defensive and totally rigid *about* their Stuff. They\u2019re not using manipulative, \u201cturn it around on you\u201d tactics when questioned. And, they\u2019re freaking flexible, all of them to some point, even when others are counting on them. I may also just be touchy about someone going so far for their gym, and/or always needing to take a 30 minute shower after they walk in the door? But like. I dunno man.

This is about him not pulling his weight around the house and deprioritizing your relationship. \n\nHe\u2019s counting on you to pick up the slack. \n\nYou don\u2019t mention having kids, so here\u2019s my advice:\n\nStop overcompensating for his lack of care and attention to your home and your relationship. \n\nSit down and write out everything that needs to happen to keep your home and lives running aside from both of your working. Estimate times for all of it. Tell him that you are not going to bitch about the gym anymore, but you have been doing the bulk of the work- show him the list and explain that you will not be doing more than half anymore. \n\n**Now stop doing more than half.** Then take 2 hours a day and go enjoy your summer. Find something to do that you love. \n\nWhen he bitches about stuff it being done, simply remind him you are doing your share and he needs to handle it. When he bitches about you being unavailable, ask him if he wants to plan a date night with you. \n\nYour husband needs to step up. But he needs to experience the gaps you have before he can recognize them.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m just going to toss this to think about. My brother did the same thing.5 days/week. Always the same time. Lots of hours. Refused to alter his schedule, etc.  \n\nHe was cheating on my ex sister in law and this was how he arranged it. He left his cellphone out one day Egan he was \u201clate\u201d and the AP sent a text. \n\nJust do a bit of quiet investigating if this raises a flag.", "You are absolutely, unequivocally NTA.\n\nBut he's being a huge, selfish one.\n\n>He says it's really not that much time at the gym. \n\nOkay, well we know that that is objectively untrue, by like a mile, and here's your proof:\n\n>I find myself having to pick up a lot of the slack around the house and taking care of chores, errands, and responsibilities because he just doesn't have the time in the day. I find myself hardly sleeping, and I can never find the time to work out myself because I just feel so overwhelmed with everything I have to take care of outside of work. If I need him to take care of something a certain day and it conflicts with his gym schedule, it's always a hard \"no\". If I ask him to do take care of things a lot of the time, he just won't have time to do it between work and the gym. \n\nIf you are being left with the bulk of the housework, errands, and household responsibilities, to the point where you are stressed and overwhelmed by how much you're having to handle, then he is already very obviously going to the gym too much, because if he weren't, you wouldn't be having to handle his share of the household responsibilities.\n\nThe fact that he openly states that he \"doesn't have time\" to do chores, errands, etc. because it \"conflicts with his gym schedule\" or he \"doesn't have time between work and the gym\" is him *literally saying that he is spending so much time at the gym that he does not have time to do household things*. Which means that he is spending too much time at the gym, because working out isn't a responsibility, it is a privilege and something that he enjoys . . . but doing his share of taking care of the household that you BOTH live in is, in fact, a responsibility. And it is as much his responsibility as it is yours.\n\n>If I ask him to not go a day because I need his help, he makes me feel extremely guilty because he frames it as me not caring about his health, because going to the gym is ultimately for his health and well-being, \n\nPlease don't feel guilty. Seriously, there is literally no reason for you to feel any guilt at all for asking him to cut back, because:\n\nFirst of all, because he's full of shit. There is not a doctor in the world who will agree that he needs to go to the gym as often as he is, or work out for as many hours as he does, in order to be healthy. What he is doing is not for his \"health and well-being\". The type of training he's doing is exactly that: training. He's sculpting his body. He can very easily do probably half of what he does and still be doing plenty of exercise for optimal health. \n\nSecondly, don't feel guilty because once again, he's showing his arse. He's trying to make you feel guilty about interfering with \"his health and well\" being while basically admitting openly that he doesn't give a shit about YOUR health and well-being. Why is he more important than you in this relationship? Why is the priority that he gets to go exercise this often if it literally means that it is causing you stress, anxiety, and physical exhaustion, all of which are terrible for YOUR health? I'd suggest asking him why your health doesn't matter at all in this equation.\n\n>and he says he'll be more well-rested and more able to help me out if he goes to the gym. \n\nExcept that again, that's a bald-faced lie, because he's been going to the gym this often for all this time and it has not, in fact, been the impetus for him to be more helpful. It has been the opposite. \n\nI don't usually believe in ultimatums, but this is definitely the time for one. He's being boldly selfish, cares only about himself, and isn't pulling his weight at home at all, and is excusing it with obvious bullshit. You are NTA, but he doesn't care.

This will help you feel less resentful and help him see how much space his exercise takes up.\n* Try to find even half an hour now and then to do something fun and relaxing together as a couple. It'll give him something in his life that's not exercise, give you something that's not picking up after his exercise addiction, and help him to see you as an ally rather than a threat to his addiction.\n* Ask him to skip his *first* shower of the day.\n* If the two of you can afford it, talk to him about building a home gym so he can save on commuting time. Changing his workout routine will be scary for him, and he may come up with lots of reasons why he can't do it. Ask him what it would take for him to be ok with working out at home.\n* If you're serious about wanting to work out, maybe ask him if you could work out together with him a few times and he could show you a few moves. \n* If you catch him seeming stressed out or exhausted by the demands of his workout routine, ask him if he's ok. Reassure him that he can be honest with you and you won't ban him from working out if he admits that he's having a hard time (even if you'd actually love to ban him from working out!)\n\nIn the best case scenario, this might help him get over his addiction and be fully present in your relationship. If not, it should at least help you have as good a relationship as you can have in the spaces left by his addiction. You decide whether that's enough for you in the long term.", "NTA\n\n\nHe's choosing to not be at home and contributing. You can be fit and not be absent from the actual marriage. When he's at the gym, you stop chores, errands. Go for a walk. Yes things will fall apart and then when he notices you can ask why everything went to hell when you stopped.\n\n\nHe's also gaslighting the fuck out of you, which is another thing entirely. That is toxic behaviour. If He's like this about you questioning his gym time what's he going to be like about something conceivably more serious.", "Hiya..  didn't read the entire thread.. But as someone who balances work kids and a family I invested in a squat rack, platform, weights and bars about 20 years ago. If you are able, a home setup would allow you to support community fitness on the weekend and will allow your husband to train at home around the  schedule.  \n\nIt is way less intimidating to get a simple setup and have great results. When you love training, you find a way and the balance learned makes you stronger at the end of the day. \n\nBesides... What's the point of being some kind of jacked monster at the expense of your family?\n\n** Strength isn't defined by the amount of weight you can lift, it means uplifting others.

It takes 30 min a day to maintain a good body you dont need 2.5 h to work out. \n\nNormal people who work out do it 1-1.5 h a week 3 days a week and 30-45 min the days btw. Ifs excessive.", "He prioritizes the gym. You need to start prioritizing yourself. You are NTA but you will be if you keep letting yourself be treated like this.", "NTA.

Look, I get making exercise a priority and when I started regularly working out, I had to set some boundaries.   But this is excessive.

Law of averages 8 hr work day + unknown commute + 3.5 hrs gym + 8 hrs sleep + 0.5 hr extra shower and ablution that\u2019s at least 20 hours of 5 days a week spoken for without chores/shopping errands etc. So do you have a relationship or are you a house keeping to a gym addict who doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself. \n\nDon\u2019t invest anything that needs time with this man pets, kids, outings.", "NTA, not a gym problem. Problem is that from your post he doesn\u2019t do anything around the house and is using the gym as an excuse.

As a matter of fact, see what you can do to go with him for about 2 weeks and see how that goes.  Just to see his reaction, I'm super curious.  Pay attention to the people there everyday and be sure to introduce yourself as his wife a lot.  :D", "Info, so lots of people are asking about the cheating? Is he or isn't he?  \n\nI'll say this. I used to in my 20s go to the gym religiously. That was my stress relief, time to shut everything out and reset.  My wife made me quit.  Stress level high I wore a bite guard at night. I now take three meds for BP.  I'm obese by BMI standards.  \n\nThis past year I said enough and went back after 20 years.  I feel great.  Sleep 6 to 8 hours straight. No bite guard.  Losing weight, stress level down.  Next dr visit going to talk about reducing BP meds.  \n\nSo, for my own perspective if he isn't cheating. I would say Y T A and you need to think long term. Have him find a location closer and cut the shower time. I do like long hot showers. But, twice a day nope.", "NTA", "This is the best comment. The only thing I would add is to make sure that your list of things that need to be done is fair and accurate. Most women in this situation grossly, and I mean grossly \u2014 underestimate the time they spend doing household maintenance and care-taking. Give yourself a week, take notes, write down everything you do. Do not short-change yourself.  Write really thorough list before you cut it\u201d half.\u201d And count everything that you do, even all the little things that you do without thinking. And then make sure you spend 2 1/2 hours every day doing something for yourself, just like he does. And then see how much time there is leftover to do all the things he expects and takes for granted.
