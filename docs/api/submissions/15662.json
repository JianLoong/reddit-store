You have nothing to feel bad about other than letting her do it again after the first time. She's the guilty thief.\n\nIdeally, don't live with your SIL anymore.

If you lived in different houses, I'd say that everybody sucks here and this is a matter for the police to handle, but I highly doubt the police would do anything about a theft where the stolen item has merely been moved to a different room in the same house, so just walking in and taking it back was probably the best thing you could have done. Now, you need to confront her as a thief and make it clear that her behaviour won't be tolerated.", "NTA. \n\nShe already took it once, and your snooping resulted in a clear win- she had your ring- which means your actions were fully on target. \n\nNow, place the ring somewhere safe, and I mean very, very safe (in a box, in another box, at the bottom of your closet, and locked away) and just say nothing. SIL can't ask about the ring being missing, because it shouldn't be something she has in the first place. Check on the ring almost daily but do not wear it and keep it very safe. After a month or so, wear the ring, loud and proud, and if she asks, just say \"oh ya it turned up, isn't that great, I thought I lost it forever!\" And then again, keep it locked away. \n\nYou also need to speak with your husband about what to do in the long term. She isn't just taking one item, she is probably snooping around through your stuff and might take other things, so you should get a lock for your door, or lock up your valuables, or get a camera that you can turn off when you are away (or all three). You and your husband can also decide to confront SIL about the ring, if that feels like a more straightforward option, and if/when she says \"I can't believe you looked through my stuff\" your husband- not you- should say \"Sis, I already got the ring out of your room once and then you took it again, which is how wife found it in your room, this is about you stealing, not about US going through your stuff to get stuff back that you shouldn't have.\"\n\nYou do not need to feel guilty about going through her stuff, nor do you need to apologize for it, and until your husband and you talk and have a plan, lock that ring away and play dumb about the whole thing.", "NTA but how about this time lock it up so she stops stealing it!! At this point you\u2019re just letting her have it by not going in her room and confronting her. I live my sister in law who is an ex addict so every room stays locked when we are not home so she can only access her room, the living room, the kitchen, and a bathroom. When we get home we open up shop again. We also have cameras everywhere but bedrooms and bathrooms. If anything ever goes missing I will be the first one to take her door off the hinge and look around for my stuff. Stop letting her get away so easily.", "NTA.  Once you get your stuff, put that jewelry box out in the yard along with all her other possessions.", "NTA\n\nYou had reasonable suspicion to think she'd taken it again. I agree with others that a lockbox and a camera is in order (assuming you can't afford to move out yet). \n\nBut please, OP, grow a spine. If you continue to go around life like this, you're going to be taken advantage of by everyone. She's a proven thief. She's the one who should feel guilty.", "NTA and get a Safety Deposit Box at the bank....keep all.the jewelry you do not wear every day in in.\n\nThis is crazy", "NTA, and put it in a safe or a security deposit box.", "Or hide it where she will never find it, or have it made me not a pendant and wear it. They s girl is a thief", "NTA- confront his sister about the stealing or it will not stop. You might have other things missing you haven't noticed yet. She is stealing from you and lying to you and her family about it. What if she steals it again and actually loses it or damages it.", "This. And when you see her notice it, look her directly in the eyes.", "Also say something oh that reminds me I can go close that police report since it\u2019s been found thank you so much!", "NTA put a simple pad lock through it when you aren't wearing it", "Also I wouldnt be surprised if husband was in on it. Maybe wear the ring on a chain?", "She said they life with his family.  Sounds like it's his parents place and his sister also lives there so they can't boot her out.  They need to take steps to get their own place and then not allow SIL to be there.", "Perhaps they\u2019re thinking that after the first time SIL went into OP\u2019s room, rifled through their stuff and stole a valuable item, OP should have locked the place up. \nNot got the ring back, then just left it lying around for Sticky Fingers to steal again.", "I see. Then, definitely, I hope they move out.", "Maybe. Would make OP naive in my mind, but I guess a case could be made for \u201ctempting\u201d Sticky Fingers or something.", "She's a liar and a thief.  Why are you feeling guilty instead of being angry?  Because she sure doesn't have a problem with stealing your ring and lying about it.\n\nAlso, why do you keep leaving it in your room when you know it will get stolen again?  You have 10 fingers (presumably), so why not just wear it all the time or wear it on a chain?", "NTA! And you should stop keeping it in plain sight either keep it on you or put it in a safe if suggest you get a chain for you and wear it around your neck or wear it on your opposite hand", "NTA She was fine with going through your stuff and lying to you. She stole from you twice. You were justified.", "NTA, She had no right to go in your bedroom. It's your personal space, and she should respect it for privacy reasons. For her to go into your room, and go through your stuff just for a ring. It is a BIG boundary she is crossing. To do such actions twice, it's time for an intervention tbh. We only know about the ring, yet are there other things missing? Or just disappeared? It scares me to know what else she's done in your room tbh. \nI'd get one of those door handles that requires a code or thumb print regardless. If she gets angry about it, that'll show how she has been going into your room without permission. \nAlso, I do understand that some families just live together in a house to save money. There should be some rules or guidelines to prevent any issues in the future. That everyone agrees on of course.", "NTA but get a safety deposit box", "NTA. Why did you not put it away after she stole it the first time?", "Nta", "Nothing with change w SIL so confronting her would not have an effect on her but will make the family choose between biological daughter/sister and In-law.  Get your own place ASAP.  Wearing your grandmother\u2019s ring on necklace or other hand is only option until you get out of there.", "Nta but get a locked box for your jewelry or put it in a safety deposit box. She will 100% steal it again.", "INFO: why aren't you or your husband calling her out for taking the ring?", "Honestly I would start wearing the ring again all the time.  Show her that you have it by wearing it.  She can't confront you for going through anything of hers without confessing that she stole it.  Either that or get a safe or lock box she can't open.  NTA.", "NTA she's literally repeatedly stealing from you, and for some reason your husband is okay with it. I'd recommend getting a chain to keep the ring on around your neck because clearly she has no shame about doing this even after being caught (because there were no consequences).", "YTA for not putting a lock on your door. Its what you do when you have a thief in the family. And go get your own place. Your home is not a safe environment.", "NTA. No reason at all to feel guilty, and I'm sorry you're stuck living with a thief.", "NTA. Put it in a safe now. She will disappear it again.", "NTA. You were retrieving your ring. Not going through HER things. I would suggest putting the ring on a chain and wearing it as a necklace. She'd have to rip it off you to get it then. If you are not wearing it, lock it up.", "SIL is a thief. What's **yours** is not **hers.**  Let your husband know where your 'lost\" ring was, once again, found. This is twice now that she's stolen from you.

It\u2019s not in the house at all!", "NTA. She\u2019s stealing from you and lying about it. You only did what you had to in order to get a family heirloom back from a thief.

Sil can\u2019t be trusted.", "I don\u2019t know if that would work? \nShe\u2019s not wearing it around then, just putting it in her jewelry. \n\nMaybe some sort of locking TILE that OP can page from her phone? It goes missing, she pulls out the phone in front of everyone and they all follow it to SIL\u2019s jewelry box\u2026", "Well that\u2019s been proven to be untrue twice now", "That might be sufficient explanation for the first time she stole it from you, but frankly, after that, you should have locked it up somehow (a locking box, a safe, a safety deposit box, a lock on the door, whatever). \n\nAre you always this passive? Do you just *never* stand up for yourself, no matter what anyone does to you?", "You have a blatant, shameless thief living with you. She may be family but she isn\u2019t treating you like family should. Protect yourself like you would if she was a blatant, shameless thief unrelated to you. She stolen from you twice that you are aware of. Past history proves she will do it again (don\u2019t assume it will be the ring she decides to steal). If she successfully steals from you again it\u2019s on you because you are enabling her at this point by avoiding confrontation."]}
