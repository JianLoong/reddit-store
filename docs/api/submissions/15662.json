Now, you need to confront her as a thief and make it clear that her behaviour won't be tolerated.", "NTA. \n\nShe already took it once, and your snooping resulted in a clear win- she had your ring- which means your actions were fully on target. \n\nNow, place the ring somewhere safe, and I mean very, very safe (in a box, in another box, at the bottom of your closet, and locked away) and just say nothing. SIL can't ask about the ring being missing, because it shouldn't be something she has in the first place. Check on the ring almost daily but do not wear it and keep it very safe. After a month or so, wear the ring, loud and proud, and if she asks, just say \"oh ya it turned up, isn't that great, I thought I lost it forever!\" And then again, keep it locked away. \n\nYou also need to speak with your husband about what to do in the long term. She isn't just taking one item, she is probably snooping around through your stuff and might take other things, so you should get a lock for your door, or lock up your valuables, or get a camera that you can turn off when you are away (or all three). You and your husband can also decide to confront SIL about the ring, if that feels like a more straightforward option, and if/when she says \"I can't believe you looked through my stuff\" your husband- not you- should say \"Sis, I already got the ring out of your room once and then you took it again, which is how wife found it in your room, this is about you stealing, not about US going through your stuff to get stuff back that you shouldn't have.\"\n\nYou do not need to feel guilty about going through her stuff, nor do you need to apologize for it, and until your husband and you talk and have a plan, lock that ring away and play dumb about the whole thing.", "NTA but how about this time lock it up so she stops stealing it!! At this point you\u2019re just letting her have it by not going in her room and confronting her.

Then, definitely, I hope they move out.", "Maybe. Would make OP naive in my mind, but I guess a case could be made for \u201ctempting\u201d Sticky Fingers or something.", "She's a liar and a thief.  Why are you feeling guilty instead of being angry?  Because she sure doesn't have a problem with stealing your ring and lying about it.\n\nAlso, why do you keep leaving it in your room when you know it will get stolen again?  You have 10 fingers (presumably), so why not just wear it all the time or wear it on a chain?", "NTA! And you should stop keeping it in plain sight either keep it on you or put it in a safe if suggest you get a chain for you and wear it around your neck or wear it on your opposite hand", "NTA She was fine with going through your stuff and lying to you. She stole from you twice. You were justified.", "NTA, She had no right to go in your bedroom. It's your personal space, and she should respect it for privacy reasons. For her to go into your room, and go through your stuff just for a ring. It is a BIG boundary she is crossing. To do such actions twice, it's time for an intervention tbh. We only know about the ring, yet are there other things missing? Or just disappeared? It scares me to know what else she's done in your room tbh. \nI'd get one of those door handles that requires a code or thumb print regardless. If she gets angry about it, that'll show how she has been going into your room without permission. \nAlso, I do understand that some families just live together in a house to save money. There should be some rules or guidelines to prevent any issues in the future. That everyone agrees on of course.", "NTA but get a safety deposit box", "NTA. Why did you not put it away after she stole it the first time?", "Nta", "Nothing with change w SIL so confronting her would not have an effect on her but will make the family choose between biological daughter/sister and In-law.

She will steal it again.\n\nGet it registered on your insurance, complete with pictures so she can't lie and claim it's not your ring", "NTA, but it might be worth getting a safe deposit box until you can move out.  Put all your jewelry and important documents in it, and let the bank protect them.  Keep a list.\n\nYou won't get to wear it as often, but it won't go missing.\n\nAlso the camera and locked jewelry box (and a lock for the door) that have been suggested.", "NTA, GET A LOCKBOX OR SAFE for your precious heirlooms, money, and expensive items! You live with a thief, stop feeling guilty. Don't even bother bringing it up, because you know she's a liar, too. If you aren't currently using something, put it in the safe. Make sure she can't get in.", "NTA - Why on earth would you feel guilty about taking back something someone STOLE from you? Call her out and tell her to leave your things alone.", "NTA\n\nBut you know she stole it. Why don\u2019t you put it away somewhere safe? Or where it until you get your own place? I don\u2019t understand why you are being so respectful and cautious of her things when she is actively stealing from you. Either call her out on it or put your things away properly.", "Wear the ring on another finger and wave it around in front of her. What is she going to say, \"Hey, you stole your ring that I stole twice?\" At the very least, wear it on a chain around your neck.", "Probably more like hoping against hope that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. \u201cIt might have been a mistake or something. She wouldn\u2019t really steal, right?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just glad for OP that Sticky \u201cjust\u201d took the ring, and didn\u2019t sell it or anything like that. Didn\u2019t even hide it.", "Yes. But it will leave a Clear trail of evidence too.", "NTA. But put it somewhere she cannot get it. If you catch her in your room looking for it, call her a thief.", "NTA. Tell her this ring is yours and belonged to your grandmother and if she takes it again or tries to start an argument threaten to press charges. She should know better than to take without asking.", "op=NTA\n\nBut for heaven's sake get a safety deposit box(bank) or a locked box for your room.  STOP LETTING YOUR SIL steal from you.  One of these days you won't get it back.\n\nAlso look into insurance, take photos of it, etc.\n\nAnd next time something goes missing that is valuable(or reasonably so)--HOPEFULLY NOT THE RING AGAIN--Mention that you are GOING to file a police report for stolen items(don't accuse her, just state that you know you didn't lose it, so it must have been stolen.)--you don't actually have to file a report--JUST make her think you can and will.\n\nOh--if she does take the ring again--FILE A FREAKING POLICE REPORT.  Stop letting HER STEAL FROM YOU.", "NTA", "Nta but lock it up and when she sees it if you wear it again, tell her that it's yours and she needs to stop stealing from you. I don't know why you haven't insured it or registered it", "One is never in the wrong for retrieving one's stolen property from a thief. NEVER.", "What the hell? I would have a real serious conversation with her, and maybe the police as well. That is STEALING. She TOOK you heirloom ring repeatedly. And why isn't your husband raising hell with his sister? NO MA'AM NTA ALL DAY!!", "NTA and you need to move.", "I'd just be straight with her. \"I'm not taking it off again so that you don't have a chance to steal my ring again\" and seriously not take it off", "NTA If this was the first time, I'd say going into her room was wrong.\n\nBut she's stolen the ring TWICE. Can't believe there wasn't a blow up about it the first time - what did your husband do, just sneak in and take it back and not say anything?\n\nI would have made it perfectly clear to her face that the ring was off limits (although of course you shouldn't have to explain to an adult that STEALING is wrong). \n\nYour husband and the rest of the family have to back you up publically and shame this young woman.", "no. absolutely nta. she took what\u2019s yours, TWICE and lied to you about it the second time round (for months on end). not to mention, for her to find it when you left it in your room means that she went through your things and room, again, twice, as well. this time please try keeping it closer to you or storing it in a more secluded space!", "Ummm NTA - but YTA for not kicking her thieving ass out! If someone in MY house stole MY heirloom they would be homeless on the street for all I care! Kick her out!", "Really? I would raise the f\\*\\*\\*ing roof. Outright theft TWICE. Why ignore it to 'keep the peace'?", "Yes, and I don't get all these comments about playing dumb and just saying nothing. Confront the thief! Lay down the law! Sheesh. This whole 'wear it in front of her so she knows you found it' is wild! She needs to know that the police will be called next time something goes 'missing' - and follow through with that!", "At last, someone sensible!", "Literally. I would lose my mind. It\u2019s so disgusting I don\u2019t care who you are! To have your sister in law continue to steal jewelry from you is just insane to me.", "# We live with my husband's family", "But she was clearly wearing it out as per the first time.", "I'd go a step further and say safety deposit box", "It\u2019s with stuff she just took off.not on her finger when OP saw it. \n \nIf she\u2019d been wearing it around the house, surely OP would have seen her wearing it?  \n\nSeems more likely it was just in the same container with the other stuff."]}
