Yes, it sucks for Sarah, but Ana shouldn\u2019t have to go without, it\u2019s not her fault. You worry about Sarah feeling it\u2019s unjust, but you don\u2019t care you\u2019re being unjust to Ana? Let the dad throw the party so Sarah knows it\u2019s not from you. Also you couldn\u2019t invite a friend of Sarah\u2019s over for her birthday to share in the cakes and snacks, maybe throw in a movie?\n\nEdit I missed the two different dads part of the post, removed my question.", "Soft YTA\n\nI see where you come from.  Sarah might get jealous if Ana has a better birthday, but your solution will not work on the long run, and could create an irreparable rift between the two stepsisters.  As you can see, Ana has already become angry and resentful towards you (and by extension towards Sarah). \n\nOn the other hand, I also understand Ana's father and why he got angry: obviously he wants a nice birthday for her daughter and, objectively, your other children are not his responsibility.  Perhaps the father could take Ana somewhere for her birthday, or organize it at his house?", "Kinda TA.\n\nHowever, your oldest daughter's dad can organize the party himself so you don't stay in such a hot spot.", "YTA\n\nIt would have been very easy to say to Sarah that Ana's Dad was giving her a 13th Bday party. You don't punish Ana for Sarah's father's actions.   I hope you still have time to throw Ana a party this coming weekend.   Also you need to start saving money, a little bit each paycheck for the 4 children's Birthdays.  That way you can use the money to fill in where their father's fall down on parties etc.", "NTA for declining to throw Anna a big party yourself. I do think you could of let her dad throw the party instead. That seems more fair to me. YTA in the future if you don\u2019t figure this out for the next years. It\u2019s overall not fair for the girls and you need to find a way to make it work for both of them (all of them) moving forward. (ie decide how big of a party you have at your house and make sure it\u2019s budgeted for in advance)", "YTA\n\n\nThis all sucks but to denie ana isn't the right thing to do either.", "YTA. All you're going to do here is ruin any chance of a positive relationship between Ana and Sarah because Ana isn't allowed nice things from her father in case it makes Sarah jealous. Why are you focused on Sarah's feelings and not Ana's? Why is it ok that Ana is hurt? Do you want Ana to leave you and move in with her father? Because that's where this is headed.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, it is not Ana's fault that you picked Sarah's dad and that Sarah's dad isn't pulling his weight.", "NTA for looking out for Sarah.   But I don't know if this approach is going to work long term.  The brutal truth is that one kid's father either has more money or cares more, right?  You're not going to be able to hide that.  Maybe there's some way to smoooooooth out the level of attention they get.  Mini party for Sarah later in the year when there's more money?  Jan birthdays suck anyway.", "So Sarah's mum and dad suck, which is why, when Anna's dad is doing the normal thing, Anna has to suffer?\n\nYta", "YTA\n\nI get why you'd be worried about the inequality that was being shown, but 13 is a landmark year in the life of a young lady. It was paid for and there is always time to do something similar for the younger children when it's their turn to have a 13th birthday", "NTA.   \nYou have four children to consider here, not one.   \nIf dad wants to throw a huge party for Ms 13\u2026 he can! In his custody visit, and he can ring and arrange it with all her friends, he can buy the food, and he can host it. It will be BRILLIANT.   \nBut if it\u2019s in your house, then you get to say \u201cthese are the milestone birthdays we\u2019ll make more effort for\u201d or \u201cThis is the budget right now for EACH OF MY CHILDREN this year for birthdays\u201d or \u201cEveryone pitches in and we have one big party a year for everyone\u2026\u201d Whatever YOUR plan is. You have four sets of feelings to consider, plus yours, and it sounds like multiple ex partners too. Sit down, discuss the options and rules, come to an agreement with your kids and then live by it so everyone has expectations of what will happen.   \nThat\u2019s fair.", "It\u2019s basically a story of why you don\u2019t have a bunch of kids with multiple guys. Yeah, it\u2019s a tough spot to be in and sadly someone is gonna be upset no matter what in this situation", "YTA. You seem to care more about Sarah than Ana. You worry about Sarah's perception of you, but you don't worry about Ana's? It appears that this is another instance of \"I don't realize I have favorites, but I do.\"", "Yta poorly handled did you explain situation to money bags dad?", "YTA\n\nYou don't build someone up by cutting others down.\n\nThis was the time to explain that life isn't always fair, her sister's dad provided money, but your love for them is always equal. \n\nNot punish your older daughter for things out of her control.\n\n*Tall Poppy Syndrome is, in very simple terms, the act of cutting down tall poppies out of envy or the need for egalitarianism.*\n\nTime=money is not understood enough.
