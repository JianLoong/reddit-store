We have no shared interests and we are very different people. I live my life with my chosen family (best friends who are closer than my brother) and my blood brother lives in another city. Whenever we do see one another I feel uncomfortable in his presence: I find him dismissive, arrogant and very unaware of mental health. He once said he thought the cure for mental health was \u201cmoney in the bank and exercise.\u201d I tried to tell him how wrong that is but he\u2019s combative to the point of making the other side give up on putting their perspective across. It\u2019s not that I hate him: it\u2019s more that I just can\u2019t be bothered with the aggro. Or trying to educate somebody that cannot and will not learn. The last time I saw him he was very disrespectful in my home (putting his sweaty feet on my sofa) and then when I asked him to put on socks he refused. This might be a small thing but I struggle with OCD and it\u2019s just an example of one way in which he disrespects me. \n\nAnyway, around three weeks after this, he sent me a long text of demands regarding his engagement party. He took no responsibility for his behaviour over the feet, saying that we would sort \u201cour differences\u201d after the engagement party. No apology. I replied to say I would rather step back from it. I find it very difficult to brave face as it is and based on the past, those differences won\u2019t be sorted. It\u2019ll just be more of him being combative until the other side (me) gives in.\n\nMy parents originally supported our differences but have gradually become more passive aggressive with little comments as they\u2019ve got upset. They\u2019re worried about how it will look to other guests if his sibling and their daughter does not attend. They have every right to be excited. It\u2019s now causing tension between my parents and I as they don\u2019t respect the fact I\u2019ve made up my mind and don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019ve made it clear I don\u2019t want a relationship with my brother - now - or ever but they keep guilt tripping me and making me think I\u2019m being too stubborn. \nMy Mum ended up making some really unforgivable comments about it. They keep trying to justify his behaviour and tell me I\u2019ve got him wrong but I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve just learned boundaries in the last few years and I\u2019m trying to set them. \n\nI think weddings should be a place for people you get on with who want to celebrate you. I think I should be allowed to step back without being guilt tripped just because we\u2019re related. I really have no interest in a long term relationship with him.
