{"id": 22756, "submission_id": "1550j6r", "title": "AITA for not going to a baby shower 3 months after my sons funeral?", "selftext": "My husbands family has been torn apart from my inability to attend a \u201csisters\u201d baby shower. For some context this was a baby shower for my husbands \u201cbrother\u201d (best friend that his mom raised since he was 8) wife. My husband\u2019s family has also known her since she was a child as well. I had recently lost my baby after a long fight in the NICU, after many surgeries and months in the NICU my son lost his battle. While we were fighting in the NICU my \u201csister\u201d found out she was pregnant and could no longer stand to see my son because she couldn\u2019t take the sight of him being so small and hooked up to all the medical instruments and such. I 100% respected that because it was hard for me too. Fast forward to his funeral and they could hardly stay because she was too emotional and used her pregnancy as an excuse to leave. Again, didn\u2019t blame them at all because it was a lot. A month later I get an invitation to her baby shower and I honestly went full ugly crying. I didn\u2019t resent her for it and her pregnancy, but any thing baby related was just unbearable at the time. I was still in full blown grief, hardly a functioning human, and was holding on by a string. My husband and family were so worried about me at the time and it seemed so hurtful to just send that in the mail. So the day came and my mother in law called and asked in the sweetest way if I was coming and if she needed to pick me up. I said no and that my heart just couldn\u2019t handle it and that I didn\u2019t want to end up crying and make the day about me. She said okay and that she understood. When she got to the shower she told her that I wouldn\u2019t be coming and why. Later that day I got a bunch of texts calling me selfish and that I couldn\u2019t just get over myself for one day and suck it up among other harsh words. Although I admit I was protecting myself, I also knew the headspace I was in at the time and what I could handle like an adult, baby showers were not one. Her family continued to bash me long after the baby was born and when I first met her at Christmas it was so hostile and awkward. A few month after that first meeting her family openly mocked my sons death and my long grief journey. At one family gathering I was cutting up my food and my husbands \u201cbrother\u201d said \u201cwhy are you cutting that up? It\u2019s not like you have a kid to feed\u201d. I froze and left crying. after that my husbands family was torn, either they supported me or her. I feel so bad for being the riff that caused this, but am I the A hole here?", "created_utc": 1689881040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1550j6r/aita_for_not_going_to_a_baby_shower_3_months/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am terribly sorry for your loss. It\u2019s entirely reasonable you could not attend.\n\nThe comment about your cutting your food at the end is an absolute no from me. There is no explanation.

Just block all the family and just take some time for yourself.", "As a fellow loss mom,fuck those people. The first year I was an absolute zombie,and everything triggered me. 4 years later,and I still have can't breathe-cant think-cant stop crying moments in public.

These people aren't good humans.  \n\nYou are definitely not the rift that caused this. they are. They caused this. Just them, them and their shitty attitude. I can't believe his wife didn't yell at her husband but this shows what kind of human she is too. They are dirt.", "NTA - Good grief what is wrong with people. The loss of a child is the most devasting loss a parent can endure, and you don't stop feeling that loss even though time will ease the pain, it will always be hurtful. Your husband needs to speak to his family and tell them to stop being so dam selfish and realize how it would feel for them if they were to lose the little bundle of joy they have and then have someone treat them so abhorrently. Everyone deals with their grief in their own way and in their own time. I cannot even imagine the pain you have gone through, so sorry for your loss.", "NTA.

I'm very sorry for your loss, and I hope these people think better of their behavior and apologize to you.", "NTA. The way they have treated you for something so reasonable and incredibly minor is pretty fucking vicious. You did not cause any rift in this family. They have just decided to attack you for no reason.\n\nEven aside from that, you were understanding when your sister couldn't be around your son so why shouldn't the same understanding apply to you? They are all petty and horrible people. I am so sorry for your loss and having to deal with their nastiness.", "NTA These people are selfish and vile. You didn\u2019t go to the baby shower because you knew how hard it\u2019d be for you and you didn\u2019t want to cause a scene, and now they\u2019re resenting you for it. It\u2019s disgusting to bring up that your child has died, you didn\u2019t cause the riff your husband\u2019s \u201cbrother\u201d did.

This isn't your fault. \n\nI'm going to say it again because you need to know that - this isn't your fault.

He loves your husband soooooo much and is sooooo much like \"family\" that he mocks his child's death and his grieving wife. These people aren't blood. They aren't relatives. They aren't a part of your family. They are nothing but temporary and disposable people who act like assholes during your child's death.  And quite frankly if your husband does not dispose of this \"brother\" ASAP then he's not your family either. I'd demand No Contact from your husband with all these people.", "Wow. I\u2019m in.

My jaw actually dropped open in disbelief about how awful these people have been to you. \n\nSo sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it was for you to have your son in the NICU and then eventually lose his fight. No one should have to go through that. \n\nYet you were gracious. You didn\u2019t call your SIL selfish for not being able to stay through the hospital visits or the funeral. \n\nThe fact that she would call YOU selfish for not wanting to attend a baby shower (which is a totally optional gift-grab) when you\u2019ve recently lost your own baby is just reprehensible.

For some context this was a baby shower for my husbands \u201cbrother\u201d (best friend that his mom raised since he was 8) wife. My husband\u2019s family has also known her since she was a child as well. I had recently lost my baby after a long fight in the NICU, after many surgeries and months in the NICU my son lost his battle. While we were fighting in the NICU my \u201csister\u201d found out she was pregnant and could no longer stand to see my son because she couldn\u2019t take the sight of him being so small and hooked up to all the medical instruments and such. I 100% respected that because it was hard for me too. Fast forward to his funeral and they could hardly stay because she was too emotional and used her pregnancy as an excuse to leave. Again, didn\u2019t blame them at all because it was a lot. A month later I get an invitation to her baby shower and I honestly went full ugly crying. I didn\u2019t resent her for it and her pregnancy, but any thing baby related was just unbearable at the time. I was still in full blown grief, hardly a functioning human, and was holding on by a string. My husband and family were so worried about me at the time and it seemed so hurtful to just send that in the mail. So the day came and my mother in law called and asked in the sweetest way if I was coming and if she needed to pick me up. I said no and that my heart just couldn\u2019t handle it and that I didn\u2019t want to end up crying and make the day about me. She said okay and that she understood. When she got to the shower she told her that I wouldn\u2019t be coming and why. Later that day I got a bunch of texts calling me selfish and that I couldn\u2019t just get over myself for one day and suck it up among other harsh words. Although I admit I was protecting myself, I also knew the headspace I was in at the time and what I could handle like an adult, baby showers were not one. Her family continued to bash me long after the baby was born and when I first met her at Christmas it was so hostile and awkward. A few month after that first meeting her family openly mocked my sons death and my long grief journey. At one family gathering I was cutting up my food and my husbands \u201cbrother\u201d said \u201cwhy are you cutting that up? It\u2019s not like you have a kid to feed\u201d. I froze and left crying. after that my husbands family was torn, either they supported me or her. I feel so bad for being the riff that caused this, but am I the A hole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He should be ready to set the world on fire for the way they are disrespecting his family!", "Fingers crossed!", "I know it\u2019s inappropriate, but if you could just give us their address so we could send them random postcards about how they\u2019re monsters, that would be so satisfying!", "I can\u2019t believe so many people in that family are so inhuman.  It feels kind one of those families where everyone is at least semi-dysfunctional while pushing it down to keep up appearances, so it festers.  But JFC, what a bunch of monsters.", "If anyone had said that yo my wife, I'd be three shades of red and calling a local hospital cause I'd be about to admit someone. Holy cow. Now I don't condone viole ce by any means, but I'd shame them so bad they'd have to fake a heart attack to get me to back down.", "I think it's also a reflection of society's fear of death. I've been going to the cemetery my whole life. My first funeral was at 2.\n\nThe people who have been sheltered have difficulty dealing with death znd funerals", "So true. I don't know at what age you lost your child and I'm not sure if age makes a difference or not. Our daughter passed away at age 35 almost 2 yrs ago and you are so right. I know my wife and I will never get \"over it\" as they say. You do start to accept your new normal and hopefully one day you learn to live your life again. There is no timeline for this either. It really is one day at a time. Very true people are uncomfortable around you especially the first several months and many but not all know there is nothing they can say to ease the pain. After running into people and talking with them my wife has said to me in the past \"they just don't understand\". I tell her I hope they never do understand because there is truly only one way to understand that level of grief.", "And then we all went to that cute little tea shop and had jasmine tea and cakes.", "My son was 20 and passed 13 years ago.  It is a journey to fight back and begin to live again.  You are still at the beginning.  I've learned to laugh again, not just smile.  I enjoy life again.  You mention a day at a time.  At the beginning, it's an hour at a time and some hours it's a minute at a time.  I hope you both have support and love in your life.  Be well.  Sending love and strength."]}
