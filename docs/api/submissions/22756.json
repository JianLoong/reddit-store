{"id": 22756, "submission_id": "1550j6r", "title": "AITA for not going to a baby shower 3 months after my sons funeral?", "selftext": "My husbands family has been torn apart from my inability to attend a \u201csisters\u201d baby shower. For some context this was a baby shower for my husbands \u201cbrother\u201d (best friend that his mom raised since he was 8) wife. My husband\u2019s family has also known her since she was a child as well. I had recently lost my baby after a long fight in the NICU, after many surgeries and months in the NICU my son lost his battle. While we were fighting in the NICU my \u201csister\u201d found out she was pregnant and could no longer stand to see my son because she couldn\u2019t take the sight of him being so small and hooked up to all the medical instruments and such. I 100% respected that because it was hard for me too. Fast forward to his funeral and they could hardly stay because she was too emotional and used her pregnancy as an excuse to leave. Again, didn\u2019t blame them at all because it was a lot. A month later I get an invitation to her baby shower and I honestly went full ugly crying. I didn\u2019t resent her for it and her pregnancy, but any thing baby related was just unbearable at the time. I was still in full blown grief, hardly a functioning human, and was holding on by a string. My husband and family were so worried about me at the time and it seemed so hurtful to just send that in the mail. So the day came and my mother in law called and asked in the sweetest way if I was coming and if she needed to pick me up. I said no and that my heart just couldn\u2019t handle it and that I didn\u2019t want to end up crying and make the day about me. She said okay and that she understood. When she got to the shower she told her that I wouldn\u2019t be coming and why. Later that day I got a bunch of texts calling me selfish and that I couldn\u2019t just get over myself for one day and suck it up among other harsh words. Although I admit I was protecting myself, I also knew the headspace I was in at the time and what I could handle like an adult, baby showers were not one. Her family continued to bash me long after the baby was born and when I first met her at Christmas it was so hostile and awkward. A few month after that first meeting her family openly mocked my sons death and my long grief journey. At one family gathering I was cutting up my food and my husbands \u201cbrother\u201d said \u201cwhy are you cutting that up? It\u2019s not like you have a kid to feed\u201d. I froze and left crying. after that my husbands family was torn, either they supported me or her. I feel so bad for being the riff that caused this, but am I the A hole here?\n\nAdding my husbands response; \nHe was incredibly hurt when they left the funeral. Due to the NICU only direct family could come and see our son, so few people at the funeral had even seen him. So for them to leave such an important \u201cceremony\u201d was the first straw. Then the baby shower invitation was another because he found it heartless. Then the day of the baby shower was the last straw where he cut ties and blocked their numbers. Then after the food cutting comment, which he wasn\u2019t there for, he was absolutely done with anyone still even talking to them. And again, most of this wasn\u2019t his actual family by blood. \n\nMy feeling of me being the AH comes from me just feeling like this all could have been avoided if I had just been able to go. But thank you everyone. This is my first post and I\u2019m not sure how these go. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc", "created_utc": 1689881040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1550j6r/aita_for_not_going_to_a_baby_shower_3_months/", "score": 2731, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The loss of a child is the most devasting loss a parent can endure, and you don't stop feeling that loss even though time will ease the pain, it will always be hurtful. Your husband needs to speak to his family and tell them to stop being so dam selfish and realize how it would feel for them if they were to lose the little bundle of joy they have and then have someone treat them so abhorrently.

The way they have treated you for something so reasonable and incredibly minor is pretty fucking vicious. You did not cause any rift in this family. They have just decided to attack you for no reason.\n\nEven aside from that, you were understanding when your sister couldn't be around your son so why shouldn't the same understanding apply to you?

For some context this was a baby shower for my husbands \u201cbrother\u201d (best friend that his mom raised since he was 8) wife. My husband\u2019s family has also known her since she was a child as well. I had recently lost my baby after a long fight in the NICU, after many surgeries and months in the NICU my son lost his battle. While we were fighting in the NICU my \u201csister\u201d found out she was pregnant and could no longer stand to see my son because she couldn\u2019t take the sight of him being so small and hooked up to all the medical instruments and such. I 100% respected that because it was hard for me too. Fast forward to his funeral and they could hardly stay because she was too emotional and used her pregnancy as an excuse to leave. Again, didn\u2019t blame them at all because it was a lot. A month later I get an invitation to her baby shower and I honestly went full ugly crying. I didn\u2019t resent her for it and her pregnancy, but any thing baby related was just unbearable at the time. I was still in full blown grief, hardly a functioning human, and was holding on by a string. My husband and family were so worried about me at the time and it seemed so hurtful to just send that in the mail. So the day came and my mother in law called and asked in the sweetest way if I was coming and if she needed to pick me up. I said no and that my heart just couldn\u2019t handle it and that I didn\u2019t want to end up crying and make the day about me. She said okay and that she understood. When she got to the shower she told her that I wouldn\u2019t be coming and why. Later that day I got a bunch of texts calling me selfish and that I couldn\u2019t just get over myself for one day and suck it up among other harsh words. Although I admit I was protecting myself, I also knew the headspace I was in at the time and what I could handle like an adult, baby showers were not one. Her family continued to bash me long after the baby was born and when I first met her at Christmas it was so hostile and awkward. A few month after that first meeting her family openly mocked my sons death and my long grief journey. At one family gathering I was cutting up my food and my husbands \u201cbrother\u201d said \u201cwhy are you cutting that up? It\u2019s not like you have a kid to feed\u201d. I froze and left crying. after that my husbands family was torn, either they supported me or her. I feel so bad for being the riff that caused this, but am I the A hole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Burying an infant is brutal. I can understand MONTHS of depression and self-isolation or whatever grieving you may need after that.

That's been my only pregnancy so far too so the \"no kids to feed\" comment fills me with rage that I'd love to unleash on OP's \"family.\" Nobody gets to determine how deeply or how long we grieve!", "I sorta wished you went to her baby shower and ruined it.", "at the risk of being insensitive, why so many funerals?", "I feel like- under the circumstances- they can have a *little* violence, as a treat.", "\"He had it comin!\"", "Death is difficult for those who are sheltered from it; funerals are the only family event people don't take their kids to\n\nIt's easier when you accept that death is inevitable and that while we might miss people, a funeral is a completely normal event that children should attend.\n\nI knew 16 year Olds who weren't allowed to attend funerals until their grandma died, they wailed in stereo for days. That may have happened no matter what because they were 16.\n\nA 25 yo nearly had a breakdown because her grandmother died and she'd never attended a funeral.", "A bird flew by at just that time.

So was unable to see anything!", "Of course but it's more difficult when you haven't attended funerals.\n\nIm sorry for your loss. At 9 the loss of your father is a huge trauma; I don't fault you for your tears over loss of your companion, it's normal to grieve.", "Precisely.\ud83d\ude02"]}
