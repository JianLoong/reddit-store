My wedding will take place this December. My best friend (22F, she is also my maid of honor) got a new boyfriend a few weeks ago. She asked me if he could come with her to my wedding. We have enough space and budget so I told her yes, but my fianc\u00e9 (23M) and I will have to meet him first and she agreed.\n\nThe four of us went out to dinner that weekend and he seemed nice so we invited him to come to the wedding which he acccepted.\n\nYesterday was my wedding shower and my best friend and her boyfriend both attended. Everything was going fine until he started being quite vocal about his opinions on both my and my fianc\u00e9's family. The party was held at my future SIL's house which he started making snide comments on.\n\n\"Wow, your kitchens so tiny! I can barely move around in here.\"\n\n\"Living rooms a bit of a mess, Maybe you should just let (sil's husband) bring home the bacon and you can stay here and clean up.\"\n\n\"Jeez, your grass is so overgrown! Don't you have any pride in your the integrity of your home?\"\n\nThese are all direct quotes. My fianc\u00e9 asked SIL if she wanted him to say anything to which she replied that it was alright and she didn't want to start conflict. 5 minutes later, he was back at it. My older sister and her husband recently had their first child. A baby boy who is now two monthes old. My parents were cooing at the baby when he came up to him.\n\n\"Is this the new baby? Lets hope god is on his side and he doesn't look this messed up when he grown up.\" He said followed by a burst of laughter.\n\nI was about to tell him off by my sister told me not to because she doesn't want to make a scene. I didn't agree, but I talked to my fianc\u00e9 and we both agreed that he would not be allowed at our wedding any longer. I decided to tell my best friend after the party.\n\nThe last straw was when he started being this way towards my younger sister (8F). She is the flower girl at my wedding.\n\n\"Aww, what a cute dress! Of course she should probably loose some weight before the wedding.\" Followed by more obnoxious laughter.\n\nI lost my mind. I called him an imbocile and my fianc\u00e9 told him he needed to fuck off. Five minutes of yelling and fighting later him along with my best friend got in their car and started driving off. Not before he flipped us off out the window though.\n\nWhen I returned home at the shower and checked my phone I saw hundreds of angry texts from my best friends. I won't recite all of them, but most were along the lines of people act different where he is from and that I need to get over this easily offended attitude I have. He is from somewhere in the UK.\n\nEveryone else at the party agree with me and my fianc\u00e9 but my best friend is very very upset with me and now is saying that she refuses to attend my wedding if he won't also be there. I don't know what to do.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Would like to mention that my best friend was only present for the last joke he made. She was within a distance she could hear it, biut she was talking to some of my other bridesmaids so I am not sure she did. I have no idea if he still acts like this when they are alone.", "created_utc": 1694388654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fff1z/aita_for_uninviting_my_best_friends_boyfriend/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you feel that you cannot attend, I won't say that I understand, but I acknowledge that that is your choice to make. I love you, and I hope you will come.\" NTA", "NTA - As someone from the UK it just sounds like he is being a dick. Unfortunately I'm guessing you will be looking for a new maid of honour too.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding, no-one has any implicit right to be there. You can uninvite them for any reason.\n\nEither way, seems like you had plenty of reason to, given his behaviour.\n\nI'm also from the UK, and the culture thing is a shitty excuse. That is not normal here, and don't let them tell you otherwise.", "I am also from the UK and I think he is a c*** and you did the right thing. NTA", "NTA! And it doesn't matter if they \"act differently\" wherever he's from. He's not living there anymore, he has to adapt to the customs of a new place. And no one I've met in the UK (meaning, when I've been in the country) has behaved that way.\n\nSounds like a great time to dump your best friend and her boyfriend. Good riddance!", "NTA.\nI don\u2019t know how your bff isn\u2019t completely mortified.\nThis guys behavior is so outrageous, I have a hard time believing it\u2019s not deliberate. Best case scenario, he has no manners. \n\nIn any case, he\u2019s not someone I would be comfortable having around.", "British people don\u2019t act like this! Good news is he\u2019ll soon be her ex boyfriend.", "NTA\n\nThat guy sounds like a jerk.", "This guy purposely winds people up to as a way to enjoy his time. \n\nYour best friend is in that smitten lust phase where she has thick foggy rose-colored glasses and is now an extension of her boyfriend because he can do no wrong in her cloudy perception. Weddings always bring out the true version of people\u2014not just the bride and groom. Rather than speak to her bf about how his behavior is making people feel uncomfortable, she blames you for getting offended. \n\nUnfortunately, this means that your friendship is probably over because people often are too proud to admit when they CHOOSE to date jerks and double down by saying how people act differently where they\u2019re from and for you to get over your easily offended attitude. It sucks to lose a dear friend, but at least you\u2019ll know that you and your family will actually enjoy the wedding you waited so long to have. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Is your best friend really your friend or is she in complete and utter denial about how rude and abusive her boyfriend is? If she decides not to come to your wedding because you uninvited him, that's on her. Sorry that you are going through this, stand your ground, you've made the right decision.", "NTA. I have many friends and relatives in the UK I\u2019ve visited. They can be dry and definitely make jokes at your expense but not this \u2026 this guy is just rude and a complete AH. He\u2019s also a creep for commenting on an eight year old\u2019s body and a psycho for starting a fight instead of leaving when told to. \n\nSounds like your friend is too charmed atm by him being foreign to see it, I\u2019d keep that bridge open in case he\u2019s abusive and she needs help (seems like the type of guy) but you don\u2019t have to tolerate this absolute prick being anywhere near you.", "NTA. Is he from the douchecanoe region of northern Dickland? Your friend isn\u2019t the brightest crayon in the box is she?", "NTA.  \n\nThe fact that your \"best friend\" is defending him and his behavior is unfortunate.   You will most likely need to go ahead with the wedding without your \"best friend\".   If she ever breaks up with her b/f and starts to miss you, I hope you will have the heart to forgive her and become stronger friends.", "NTA.  That guy is feral and shouldn't be at any social gatherings.", "NTA.  Your friend fell for a line. \"Oh, this is just how I am because I'm from this place.\" You were smart to meet this person before the wedding . Could you imagine him spouting off at the actual ceremony or reception? Yikes!\n\nSooner or later,  your friend will come to her senses. But it may be too late for the friendship.  And if she doesn't want to come to your wedding for this man, then that's her choice. \n\nJust make sure you block her a few days before the wedding so you don't have to deal with her drama when you need to concentrate on other things.", "Um... because he's from England. That is an incredibly rude and prejudiced comment.  There is a lot of reddit stories that could make people assume a lot of non flattering stuff about Americans, but hey,  every country has its share of rude and uncouth twats and idiots.  \nNTA  he's just an  ahole.", "You find a new MOH.\n\nAnd yes, that sucks. But you don't want this asshole at your wedding insulting people and making rude comments.\n\nAnd, let's be real, it was on your best friend to get him out of the shower. She brought a new significant other. He misbehaved and was incredibly rude. Repeatedly. That was her cue to tell him that isn't acceptable and take him home. That she chose to justify it and excuse it is so unacceptable.\n\nWe're all from different locations. We all have different manners.
