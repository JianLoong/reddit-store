{"id": 30290, "submission_id": "17ng8qi", "title": "AITA for wanting my wife to clear out her late daughter's stuff to free up space for my daughter?", "selftext": "I'm going to sound like a monster, but here goes. My wife and I blended our families five years ago. When we moved in together, she had two daughters: Mel (16) and Molly (12), I had three kids: Lola (8), Brendan (7) and Brian (5), and we were expecting an ours baby.\n\nThe house is fairly small, but we have four bedrooms. The master bedroom, a downstairs bedroom/2nd master, and two smaller bedrooms. Due to space, we decided to put Lola in one bedroom, Brian and Brendan in one bedroom, and have Mel and Molly share the downstairs bedroom. The plan was that the baby would share with us for the first two years and then move the baby into Lola's room and have Lola and Molly share. Mel would have moved out for college then and just share with them for breaks.\n\nEverything got thrown into chaos when Mel passed away a year into us living together. When it would have been time to think about moving rooms, my wife couldn't even think about touching her stuff, and it was unthinkable to ask. We had an accidental (but wanted!) second ours baby, so we decided that Lola and the baby would just have to share 'for now'.\n\nOur second ours is now two, and is starting to need to not be sharing a room with my wife and I. I'm starting to think that it's time. I would never have asked at a year or even two years out, but now we're heading into year four. I understand that it's a hard thought and seems callous, but the reality is that we don't have space to keep this up anymore.\n\nWe need the space. The bedroom split is just not fair, and hasn't been for years. Lola is almost a teenager and shouldn't be sharing with one toddler, let alone two. There shouldn't be three kids sharing one of the smaller bedrooms and a total of now 5 kids sharing one bathroom. All this, while one child gets a large bedroom and bathroom for herself?\n\nIt's not reasonable. My wife and Molly are still resistant and say it's normal to not want to move things around even years later and they don't want Mel's things \"taken\" from them, especially Molly. I get that, but we can't. It's just not realistic. Even if Mel was still with us, she wouldn't live with us anymore. The plan was always to move Lola into that room once Mel went off to college. Molly was never supposed to have her own room and per the agreement made FOUR YEARS AGO, Molly is getting all of Mel's stuff, so nothing is being taken from her.\n\nThey're furious, and now the whole house is fighting. Lola is sick of her situation, Molly and my wife want nothing to change, and of course I'm the evil bad guy who does everything wrong. Is this really that outrageous?\n\nEdit: the kids are now: \n\nMolly (16), Lola (12), Brendan (11), Brian (9), ours 1 (4) ours 2 (2)", "created_utc": 1699082081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ng8qi/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_clear_out_her_late/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn\u2019t fair to any of the kids.", "NTA\n\nLosing a family member is hard and removing their belongings is even harder because it just hammers the reality that they are no longer here. \n\nMaybe you need to reword removing Mel\u2019s  belongings so instead of removing maybe pack up and put them away so it\u2019s clear nothing is being removed or taken or thrown out. \n\nWhen my dad and sister died(at separate times), as a family went through their belongings. It was sad but we got to relive a lot of fun and happy memories with some items. Each family member decide if they wanted to keep anything from their stuff (funny T-shirt, watch, sail boat modeling kit, etc.) and the remaining belongings that were in good condition was donated.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to put words exactly how hard it is but it has to be done. It will be weird to not seeing a passed loved one\u2019s items anymore but it can help with moving on (which takes a long time). \n\nYou need to compassionately and softly explain that it\u2019s sad and painful but it\u2019s not good to have all of her belongings just sitting there.  Y\u2019all don\u2019t have to donate or throw out anything but maybe pass down some items (maybe her clothes to the teenager, jewelry to your wife and teenager, furniture can be saved for future use or refurbished, etc). Anything else that wasn\u2019t passed down and not being used can sit in storage and then be looked at a later time. \n\nHowever, maybe talk, mention, refer about Mel more. Have some pictures of her (with the family, HS grad pic, etc.). The worst thing you can do in a grieving process is never talk/acknowledge or have no reference about a passed loved one it makes it seem like they never existed in the first place. My brothers did that and my mother hated it and broke her heart sometimes especially around their birthdays or the day that they of passed. \n\nAlso suggest grief counseling or just therapy doesn\u2019t have to be specifically for grief but it will be a good place to talk and process these emotions. My mom had the family do grief counseling (at least once) for both my dads and sister\u2019s passing so we had the support and ability to express, process, and manage our grief.", "Do your finances allow you to move to another home? Even if the home is the same value? If you could move home then everything would need to be packed up and every room would be a new room.

Not that he\u2019s right and she\u2019s wrong, but that they need to be on the same page, whatever that page is, first. \n\nOP, this should never have been a discussion among and with the kids before the adults were aligned on what was and was not possible or reasonable. Now you have to deal with not only their upset but also an \u201cus vs them\u201d dynamic that includes the kids. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a war, with winners and losers. It\u2019s a discussion of how the *team* can find the best solution. You and your wife need to go somewhere quiet alone and take a look at the options: move house, renovate, redistribute the bedrooms, redistribute the bathrooms, etc. Perhaps involve a mediator or counselor if you think it would be helpful, but this is urgent and you need to deal with it now to limit the damage to your marriage and your family dynamic. \n\n- **What will your finances allow?** Really allow, not just what\u2019s ideal. Can one of you take a higher paying job by sacrificing commute, job satisfaction, etc? Can you sell assets or dip into retirement (not that I\u2019m advocating that, just really dig into what is possible and what it would mean to each of you)?\n\n- **What are your (you and your wife) goals for Molly, emotionally and otherwise?** What is emotionally healthy for Molly (for example is she on track to refusing to leave home for college because she can\u2019t part with her sister\u2019s stuff? bringing it all to a dorm room and freaking out her roommate? trying to live her life \u201cfor Mel\u201d because Mel isn\u2019t getting to? does she feel like she needs to defend her mom because she\u2019s worried her mom really wants Mel\u2019s room intact? is she afraid to admit that she really just doesn\u2019t want to lose her privacy and space, and feels like those are shameful reasons that she has to cover up by claiming this is all about Mel? that she\u2019s betraying her sister\u2019s memory if she allows the room to be changed?)?\n\n- **How have you honored Mel? How can you continue to honor her?** Will you set aside space in a shared area for some professionally framed reminders of Mel? Go through her stuff and set aside things for your future grandchildren (Molly\u2019s kids, if she has them) and have them properly cleaned / stored / preserved? Set up a scholarship fund for a hobby she adored, so she lives on in your community? Do you visit her grave, if that\u2019s part of your beliefs? Do you talk about her openly as a family? Do you cry together, laugh together? Is she always and only a somber subject people avoid? How would Mel maybe feel about the current situation? Would she hate that her stuff is dividing the house? Want her things to remain exactly as they are? Wish her sister could move forward and redecorate / own her own space as she grows into womanhood?\n\n- **How are your other children experiencing this and what are they learning about death and grief?** Will they understand that death is part of life and see how profound grief doesn\u2019t disappear but slowly settles into loving memories, or will they see that death caused irreversible trauma that had to be walled off? Will they grow up in Mel\u2019s shadow? Resent Molly? Resent each other? What if the school finds out that a soon-to-be-teen is sharing space with toddlers (mixed gender included)? Would you be ashamed to have to defend this Cinderella-type situation to impartial judges? How will Lola\u2019s growth and development be impacted and what might your young children be exposed to that is age-inadvisable? \n\n- **How is your wife doing with her grief?** Does she feel you grieve too? Support her? Does she feel misplaced guilt? Is she worried that the new family she\u2019s building with you is erasing Mel? Or Molly? It is absolutely ok to not be \u201cover it\u201d but is she able to be the parent she needs to be to your remaining children? Does she feel resentment that all of *your* children are alive? Is there a safe space for her to express \u201cforbidden\u201d thoughts like that to someone who won\u2019t judge (therapist, support group) and learn that she\u2019s not alone?\n\nOnly once you and your wife understand the answers to the deeper questions can you make a decision about the rooms *together*. Perhaps you will even come up with a range of acceptable options that you then let the kids have input on. But first you need to come together and remember you are a team. You need and deserve each other, and your kids (all of them) need and deserve parents who support each other and model handling really tough parts of life with grace, forgiveness, compassion \u2026 and *teamwork*. You are building humans here, and setting them up for how they see the world, see themselves, solve problems, and select mates.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Perhaps IATA but that part always gives me the ick - 5 kids between them already to share 3 bedrooms, but these blended familys always need to \"cement\" the new marriage with \"ours babies\".", "read that it was an accidental baby like when birth control fails", "OP and wife have seven kids between them.\n\nAlso super suspicious of how daughter died since that was left out.", "The 4 and 2 year olds are sharing with the 12 year old.", "They must be good at sex.
