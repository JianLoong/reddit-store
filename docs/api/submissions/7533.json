It\u2019s not negative to point out what is actually happening. \n\nYou didn\u2019t lie, you weren\u2019t mean. \n\nYou simply refused to house someone who wasn\u2019t going to pull her weight.", "NTA - and you\u2019ve not mentioned how big or small your income disparity is.

It sounds like this was on your mind, and it was like word vomit. What sucks is that if I were Tom, I could never trust you again because I'm sure he said that stuff to you in confidence, and I'll always wonder when you're going to be frustrated and let out something I may have told you. Actually, I DID have a friend that said something that I said in confidence to others in a moment of anger, and although I was going to eventually figure out how to deal with it, she took away that option, and it blew up.  I definitely don't trust her for anything that is more discreet now. Not to mention that I'm sure it made Kat upset with him as well. \n\nThat being said, you definitely aren't obligated to house them.

WTF!), they need to apply for low/no income benefits and sell everything they can to get back on their feet and sure as hell should be grateful if anyone helps them at all.\n\nETA: totally agree with the others that state you'd end up having to evict them, and I'd fully expect them to damage/steal or have to have dragged out, screaming bloody murder about how awful you are all the while.", "NTA.

I was also still working as an essential worker, but she was unemployed and my husband was on furlough. So my husband had to be at home with someone else in his space all day. My husband loves my friend, even picked out her Christmas gift this year and loves hanging around with us, we just needed our space back. And my friend did have somewhere else to go stay, we didn\u2019t just kick her out onto the streets. \n\nI would also like to say that as an owner of two basset hounds, dogs being in your house when you never wanted dogs in there, or just don\u2019t want other\u2019s dogs there, is totally reasonable. They shed, they get dirty, their fur is everywhere. I love my dogs, but I i vacuum twice a day and wait till the last minute to change out of house sweats before I go anywhere.

How good of them!", "Clearly NTA. You have no obligation to house them and honestly it's a bit presumptuous to ask. Is this guy closer, emotionally not physically, to you than family?

Oh and a new car too, also the dog needs surgery and I'd like braces  \n\nTheir situation sucks and I can sympathize, but there's more to the story when people can't make rent.

It's one thing to let someone stay with you when they're starting a new job in a new area before they're settled or if they're just starting a better paying job that will allow them to move out soon.

She did not want to take no and kept pushing, so OP told her why he didn't want her as a housemate: her dogs are indoor dogs, so presumably there could be mess from them, she doesn't work and would be in OP's house alone all the time, and she doesn't contribute financially or chore-wise, so the burden for the extra chores and financial costs that having an extra person in the house would bring would fall on OP and Tom. \n\nWho wants someone moving in who will only generate more expenses and more messes, and who is so entitled that they think OP is supposed to sacrifice for them?

It wasn't good enough for her. She needed a reason. She got a reason. \n\nOP was saying that she's lucky Tom tolerates her behaviour, but that he was unwilling and would not do so. Harsh but a fair statement. It's saying, \"You're lucky that he is content with paying the bills and doing the chores. I will not and do not want to do so.\" \n\nNow, if OP told them no and Kat left it alone, you're absolutely right that it would be unnecessary and unreasonable to say those things.

She was told the truth, and OP is right that she is lucky that she has a partner willing to shoulder most of the load, but OP does not want or have to do so. \n\nAgain, it's fair to say in context. Two extra people plus dogs means more expenses and more chores, like vacuuming more because of dog hair. Now, in their home, Tom was willing to do the chores and pay for the bills. He was willing to tolerate Kat not contributing. However, in OP's home, it would be OP and Tom shouldering that burden. OP is not willing to have someone stay in their home who will not contribute; OP even says Tom would be welcome because Tom would be actively contributing, but that Kat would not be. OP would not tolerate that. \n\nAnd think of it this way based on Kat's behaviour; if OP just said a flat no, she'd be going around saying it was so mean and OP couldn't even give her a good reason for not letting them stay.

But it isn't mine or anyone business to call out relationship issues.", "It's not his place to tell her", "To be fair they might have simply no extra room free. Most people don't rent bigger places than they really need for money reasons. They already having children is also possible. Or they still live themselves with their parents. \n\nSo they might not have lied that they would have helped them if they had a house and place like OP. \n\nBut they of course actually like Kat. That alone makes a big difference really. OP doesn't seem to like her at all which I don't hold against him. Also her friends might like dogs, while OP doesn't want them in his house at all.", "OP - If you are getting flak on Social media from her flying monkeys, go NC with Kate's friends and block them.", "You didnt do that! They did.", "A hobosexual is, if I\u2019m understanding correctly, someone who supports themselves primarily via freeloading from their partners.", "Yes, OP would be supporting Tom, fianc\u00e9, and 2 dogs for an indefinite amount of time. Ugh! No way.", "Can't believe you lasted that long. Was there any reason you put up with it when he was a creep?", "That's still wayyyyy too long to be staying in someone else's house you totally did the right thing. Also it's not like it'll be better for a whole inflation and rental market is lunacy out here, even more so in tas I bet. If she won't get a job they will probably be at her parents for ages. Nta 100% you did the right thing.\n\nEta my response to her annoying friends would be well they can stay with you if you care so much watch them disappear so fast lol.", "If I read it right they have been at Kay\u2019s parent\u2019s place for a year, that would have been enough time for them to get back on their feet. However with Kat being unemployed it\u2019s going to take even longer, you dodged a bullet. The only reason her family is upset with you is because they now have to deal with the shit you did not want to deal with. That\u2019s not your responsibility.", "Or, have an overactive imagination \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude02.", "If so, can you please tell me when I'll be losing my virginity?\n\nI'm already 29 with no hope in sight \ud83d\ude2d", "Exactly, op states she \"doesn't work\" does that mean, like ever? They don't have a child and she has no house to manage so what she sits on her thumb all day long? Lol I truly don't get it. I'm a female and have a daughter I fully take care of and have worked a full time job her whole life. If they were struggling at all especially monetarily she can and would work. It makes no sense. It's the equivalent of saying you can't unscrew something, but have a screwdriver right next to you. She can help. I hope she isn't just using ops friend to support her the rest of her life.", "could be mental health issues or other medical issues, so I wouldn't judge her without that context.", "Shes probably lazy, everyone can work.", "Kat is a loafer - that's why they are in this situation.  OP made the right decision as he would probably have these two with him until he was forced to initiate an eviction notice.", "Sounds like your friend really needs to look at who he is gonna spend the rest of his life with. He is frustrated now and they are not married. He works all day and she does nothing but stay at home and then he still has to come home and do the house work. That's just wrong. Why cant she get a job and help with the money? I wouldn't have let her move in either. Helping someone who is struggling is great but just letting someone move in who obviously isn't going to do anything to contribute and help NOT. Poor Tom.", "I wouldn't let them move in with you, but I will point out that in many places tenant's rights change completely if they share living spaces with the owner. When you're checking legislation in Australia make sure you're checking if that's the case for your area as well.\n\nIn my province if I had someone living in my home paying me rent it would be classified as shared accommodation, not covered in the same way as a tenancy agreement.", "i was going to say this, or something along the lines of \" they made it hard on them by choosing to live on 1 income\" not OP's responsibility to bail everyone out", "At this point you shouldn't give an inch as they may try to take a foot (or is it miles/km \ud83e\udd14)\n\nAlso, if there's a very urgent case of him staying there, op should make sure to mention that this is one time thing, and not allow him/them to stay for more than 2-3 days continuously as they may get tenant/squatter rights"]}
