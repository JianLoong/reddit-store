It\u2019s not negative to point out what is actually happening. \n\nYou didn\u2019t lie, you weren\u2019t mean. \n\nYou simply refused to house someone who wasn\u2019t going to pull her weight.", "NTA - and you\u2019ve not mentioned how big or small your income disparity is.

It sounds like this was on your mind, and it was like word vomit. What sucks is that if I were Tom, I could never trust you again because I'm sure he said that stuff to you in confidence, and I'll always wonder when you're going to be frustrated and let out something I may have told you. Actually, I DID have a friend that said something that I said in confidence to others in a moment of anger, and although I was going to eventually figure out how to deal with it, she took away that option, and it blew up.  I definitely don't trust her for anything that is more discreet now. Not to mention that I'm sure it made Kat upset with him as well. \n\nThat being said, you definitely aren't obligated to house them.

WTF!), they need to apply for low/no income benefits and sell everything they can to get back on their feet and sure as hell should be grateful if anyone helps them at all.\n\nETA: totally agree with the others that state you'd end up having to evict them, and I'd fully expect them to damage/steal or have to have dragged out, screaming bloody murder about how awful you are all the while.", "NTA.

I was also still working as an essential worker, but she was unemployed and my husband was on furlough. So my husband had to be at home with someone else in his space all day. My husband loves my friend, even picked out her Christmas gift this year and loves hanging around with us, we just needed our space back. And my friend did have somewhere else to go stay, we didn\u2019t just kick her out onto the streets. \n\nI would also like to say that as an owner of two basset hounds, dogs being in your house when you never wanted dogs in there, or just don\u2019t want other\u2019s dogs there, is totally reasonable. They shed, they get dirty, their fur is everywhere. I love my dogs, but I i vacuum twice a day and wait till the last minute to change out of house sweats before I go anywhere.

How good of them!", "Clearly NTA. You have no obligation to house them and honestly it's a bit presumptuous to ask. Is this guy closer, emotionally not physically, to you than family?

Oh and a new car too, also the dog needs surgery and I'd like braces  \n\nTheir situation sucks and I can sympathize, but there's more to the story when people can't make rent.

It's one thing to let someone stay with you when they're starting a new job in a new area before they're settled or if they're just starting a better paying job that will allow them to move out soon.

She did not want to take no and kept pushing, so OP told her why he didn't want her as a housemate: her dogs are indoor dogs, so presumably there could be mess from them, she doesn't work and would be in OP's house alone all the time, and she doesn't contribute financially or chore-wise, so the burden for the extra chores and financial costs that having an extra person in the house would bring would fall on OP and Tom. \n\nWho wants someone moving in who will only generate more expenses and more messes, and who is so entitled that they think OP is supposed to sacrifice for them?

It wasn't good enough for her. She needed a reason. She got a reason. \n\nOP was saying that she's lucky Tom tolerates her behaviour, but that he was unwilling and would not do so. Harsh but a fair statement. It's saying, \"You're lucky that he is content with paying the bills and doing the chores. I will not and do not want to do so.\" \n\nNow, if OP told them no and Kat left it alone, you're absolutely right that it would be unnecessary and unreasonable to say those things.

She was told the truth, and OP is right that she is lucky that she has a partner willing to shoulder most of the load, but OP does not want or have to do so. \n\nAgain, it's fair to say in context. Two extra people plus dogs means more expenses and more chores, like vacuuming more because of dog hair. Now, in their home, Tom was willing to do the chores and pay for the bills. He was willing to tolerate Kat not contributing. However, in OP's home, it would be OP and Tom shouldering that burden. OP is not willing to have someone stay in their home who will not contribute; OP even says Tom would be welcome because Tom would be actively contributing, but that Kat would not be. OP would not tolerate that. \n\nAnd think of it this way based on Kat's behaviour; if OP just said a flat no, she'd be going around saying it was so mean and OP couldn't even give her a good reason for not letting them stay.

Isn\u2019t that what OP means by they kept pushing?

That alone would be a super hard pass from me.\n\nBut then there's quite a few red flags too. A young couple that can't afford their own place, yet one of them has 2 dogs and refuses (I assume) to work is already activating some alarm bells. Then you read she doesn't do anything in the house either, which is yet another problem on the rapidly increasing pile of flags. One would be expected to pursue work relentlessly in order to avoid being homeless, but when you don't even see a hint of effort on their part, it's a huge red flag. After all, what are the chances they can ever afford to leave your house? It's not like they'll magically be able to afford a place if nothing changes (if anything, an upcoming wedding will only further delay these plans a lot). Not taking \"no\" for an answer is yet another red flag.\n\nAnother worry of mine would be them getting pregnant. Sure, it's speculating, but chances are a young couple eventually wants children. You simply have no guarantees they'll be responsible enough to wait until they can afford their place and you can't police their bodies either. At best you could opt to kick them out if it came to that, but that invites a host of other problems as well.\n\nThe fact that you're getting flak for not taking them in now only serves to confirm you made the right call.", "NTA.

Why doesn't she work or make dinner?", "NTA the dog is enough to say no to if you don\u2019t want to lie with a dog. It sounds like Kat is a mooch and it sounds like you went in on her.

Tom needed to sacrifice the idea of having a SAHW, and the idea of being a single home income. \n\nYou did not put them in any situation, no mater what those close to Kat say.
