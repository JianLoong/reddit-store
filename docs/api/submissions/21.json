My dad and her mom met at a school event a couple of years ago and they got married this year due to an oops baby.  Since her dad isn\u2019t in the picture and my mom is overseas for work for a few years, the living situation has gotten weird and Amy and her mom haven\u2019t done much to make that any better.\n\nI could tell Amy hated the whole idea of our parents being together from the start, and I thought it was just that she didn\u2019t like all the changes. I didn\u2019t know until later that it was partly because of me.  She makes a lot of comments about me being \u201cMiss Perfect\u201d and how everyone caters to me because I\u2019m pretty.  I think I\u2019m average at best, I play sports so I stay in shape but I\u2019m nothing special and I can\u2019t do makeup to save my life.  Since we all moved in together, though, she has something snarky to say every time I do well at something or go out with friends or anything.  I\u2019m in honors classes and AP because the teachers pass me easy because I\u2019m a suck up and an athlete.  I get invitations and out of school opportunities because of my looks.  My friends are all dumb jocks. People only like me because I\u2019m pretty.  It\u2019s really annoying and the parents wouldn\u2019t do anything about it except just laugh it off so I finally snapped at her about it and said not even being pretty would make up for her ugly personality, so maybe she should work on herself instead of me.\n\nShe screamed at me and her mom got mad and told me I was being cruel.  My dad did stick up for me, but told me later in private that Amy has a rough time socially and is depressed and feels bad because I\u2019m really high performing at school and people compare her to me now. He asked if I would try to not be as obvious about doing better than her, and I should stay home more or include her in more stuff so she feels better.\n\nI told him I\u2019m just living my life and I\u2019m not going to do anything different just because she\u2019s jealous. I don\u2019t want to hang out with her because she\u2019s mean and my friends don\u2019t deserve that.  The best I\u2019m going to do is ignore her from now on since she gets to throw shots but sucks too much to take one back now and then.\n\nIt\u2019s causing a lot of stress and my step-mother says I\u2019m a stuck-up brat.  My dad has been trying to keep me home more, but I told him keeping me out of my clubs is going to look awesome for college scholarships so he\u2019s frustrated.

Be rational and try to keep any emotion you may have regarding this out of it. Because in the long run that\u2019ll go a long way towards them actually listening.

However, that will heavily depend on your step sisters ability to reconcile her negative feelings towards you. If she's unwilling to work with you about how your existence makes her feel, then it's not possible to work with her.\n\n Sure, you could drop your activities, isolate yourself, and flunk your classes, but what would that accomplish? She's likely going to still feel bad about herself, or she'll feel superior to you having won this. Both create an unhealthy relationship where her self worth is dependent on comparison.

We have never in our lives been good at the same things. He was a classic jock, effortlessly gifted in sports and super charismatic with a social circle that probably stretched over half our very very big high school. I was good at school and at music, but I never had any kind of trouble making friends either because if there\u2019s anything my brothers and I all share it\u2019s that we\u2019re all excellent conversationalists. But I\u2019m now straying from my point. Let me get back to it. We\u2019re twins, so we were in the same year. I took all upper level classes and extra science electives because I wanted to, and took AP when that was an option because I wanted to. My twin is plenty smart but he has trouble sitting still, so he would occasionally take an on-level class because it still gets you to graduation at the end and that\u2019s more time for sports. He would never in a million years have asked me to stop taking upper level classes or quit orchestra just because he didn\u2019t do those things. I would never in a million years would have asked for him to stop being the star of the football team or to act like he had less friends to make me feel better. That\u2019s not how confident people act. \n\nYour step sister\u2019s problem isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s her own lack of confidence. She\u2019s comparing to you because she\u2019s not confident, and will not gain confidence so long as she\u2019s still comparing and putting you up on this idealized pedestal. Maybe next time just stick with telling her to work on herself before talking about you and say you don\u2019t want to hear anymore. Otherwise, snap back as often as you need because no one has the right to while you down just to make themselves feel less inadequate.", "NTA she needs therapy, she's a bully", "Your stepsister has a rough time socially because she\u2019s a rotten, bitter person and people don\u2019t like that. How dare your dad try to jeopardise your future in order to please his wife. You\u2019re his child and first priority. Amy can take a hike. NTA.", "I\u2019m going to say mild ESH. Your step-sister and step-mom definitely, for obvious reasons. Your dad for trying to make you stop doing things you enjoy because your more popular. But also you, for not trying to see how hard things are for your step-sister. You said it yourself, things come easier for you not because you\u2019re better or work harder, but because you\u2019re a suck up, and athlete, and pretty. Amy sounds like she struggles socially, and while she hasn\u2019t handled it in a good way, she\u2019s lashing out because she\u2019s jealous of your popularity. I\u2019m not saying this is your fault, but sometimes it helps to take a step back to see where the other person is coming from. You come across as a stuck up snob who doesn\u2019t want to associate with anyone not in your same social circle.", "THIS. OP, I'm sorry. 16 is a really tough age and I can see how step-sis is very jealous of you and likely extremely insecure and with low self-esteem. But as you mentioned, none of that should factor in to how she's treating you, there's no excuse for her behavior. Parents might want to consider sending you both to different schools if that's possible, which may be beneficial to you both.

However, they see OP shrug off her step sister\u2019s bullying with what probably comes off as mild annoyance, while they see step sister throw a full tantrum the one time OP snaps back. \n\nIt\u2019s exactly the same formula as the toddler.

I\u2019m sorry you are in this position and there are no adults looking out for you.", "I\u2019m gonna guess it\u2019s because the parents think/know that OP is talented & high performing, so anything the stepsis does is \u201cpunching up\u201d, but when the \u201csuperior\u201d person retaliates, it\u2019s \u201cpunching down\u201d and \u201cbullying\u201d.

She one doesn\u2019t want me or my dad around, so I\u2019m giving her what she wants by trying to stay away from her but that\u2019s still not good enough for her, she has to talk smack, too.", "I\u2019m not a suck up or pretty, though, that\u2019s what Amy says about me.  I\u2019m an athlete because I put I a. Lot of work to stay on the team. I do a lot of studying and work and training outside of school.  I do well because I try really hard because I want to go to my top pick school when I graduate and I can\u2019t do that if I slack off now.  Amy doesn\u2019t do anything or study, so yeah, she doesn\u2019t do very well, it has nothing to do with being social or pretty, at least not that I can see.\n\nI hang out with a lot of different people, I just don\u2019t like mean people and Amy has been mean since our parents started making us hang out.

Even though it makes no sense (to favor any at all, I'm not saying it makes sense the opposite lol), that perfectly describes why my parents hated me getting angry at my brother for attacking me all the time.\nIronically I later became disabled and \"less successful\" and then they just hated me because I was a burden.\n\nAlso obligatory school success doesn't amount to anything and I'm not saying either is superior.", "I'm not saying he doesn't need to take a stand, he should.
