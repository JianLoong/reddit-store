My company overreacted, in my opinion, and dismissed me. I\u2019ve had to accept this and move on but it\u2019s been hard.\n\nTo keep afloat, I\u2019ve got 2 minimum wage jobs in unrelated areas. I\u2019ve only just started them and already absolutely hate them! They are boring and brutal, I\u2019m quickly eating into savings and I\u2019m desperately looking for something similar to before. I\u2019m applying for jobs but nothing yet. It\u2019s awful atm and I\u2019m really worried.  \n\nMy BF \u201cDave\u201d and his older brother \u201cKieran\u201d both work at the same company, but in different functions. Kieran is more senior and has been there longer. Dave hasn't been there long and got the job through his brother.\n\nWe went to his parents for dinner the other night. Kieran and his GF were there too. I\u2019ve always got on well with all of them and they know my situation and have generally been supportive.\n\nIt came out (accidentally, which stung a bit) that there is a vacancy at their company, similar to my previous job.  \n\nI asked about it and Dave couldn\u2019t help, hadn\u2019t known about it, didn\u2019t know the people involved or what the job was.  \n\nKieran did know and could have helped but was non-committal and vague but I kept asking and he provided more details. I thought I could definitely do it and was really enthusiastic.\n\nI asked him if I could apply and he wasn\u2019t keen at all and said he didn\u2019t think it was a good fit and  not my thing.  He knows anything would be at the moment!  \n\nI said it sounded perfect and I wanted to apply and asked him to put a good word in for me. He still didn\u2019t sound happy about it and kept making lame excuses. \n\nHe said it was a different department, he wasn\u2019t the hiring manager and couldn\u2019t influence it, I was free to apply but he couldn\u2019t really recommend me. I asked why not as he\u2019d recommended Dave for a job in a different department. Then his mum got involved, backing me up, saying family  was important and I was a great worker. \n\nHe argued for a bit with us, then said he\u2019d not had concerns about Dave, he did about me! After everything that\u2019s happened, and thinking he was on my side, wow! I got annoyed and probably shouted a bit and asked him what he meant.\n\nHe said I had a work ethic and attitude problem and I didn\u2019t get fired for nothing and he wasn\u2019t prepared to harm his own career recommending someone who he had concerns about!  He said family loyalty also meant me not harming him at work! I couldn't believe it and said so. His mum agreed with me and there was a big row, us v Kieran.\n\nThen Dave also got involved and asked his mum to back off and me to leave it which was even more hurtful.\n\nWe left soon after and Dave is now annoyed with me for \u2018causing\u2019 the fight. All I\u2019m trying to do is get back on my feet and be given another chance and I feel so unsupported. We had another fight and he blames me for that.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673706105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bpkn1/aita_for_asking_my_bfs_brother_for_a_chance_of_a/", "score": 1598, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It just shows poor judgment and bad time management.  If you were in the US, I think you'd get more slack.  But you're in the UK so you get at least 28 paid days of holiday per year.  So you absolutely breached your employers' trust.  Not to mention the absolute stupidity of putting the proof on social media.  \n\nI absolutely wouldn't jeapordize my good reputation at a company to vouch for you.", "Info:  why were you fired and is this the same reason the brothers think you were fired for?", "YTA\n\nKieran was being politely non-committal, but you kept pushing him until the truth was revealed; he had concerns about you as a worker.

First, no is a complete sentence, and whining \"family\" does not entitle you to anything.  You are not owed anything by your BIL. Secondly,  you committed fraud. I'd turn you  down, too.

You committed a CRIMINAL offense. Fraud is fraud.", "YTA\n\nYou can't back a person into giving you a reference and he clearly didn't want to give one.", "Your company did not overreact. You believing that they did shows you are not ready to accept responsibility and consequences. I would not recommend you either.", "YTA.

You haven't given us any details on why your previous employer terminated you, but I assume that Kieran knows about it.  You're asking Kieran not just for a recommendation, but to potentially put his reputation on the line. I don't blame him. You can still apply, but I wouldn't mention Kieran or Dave going forward.\n\nEDIT: after learning why OP got fired, I'm changing my vote to YTA. Just because others have done it, doesn't make it right. You're an immature brat, and I wouldn't hire you or want you to work for the same company either.", "YTA. You've not provided any details of your 'misjudgement' that got your fired. Clearly your bf's brother feels your either your company didn't overreact or your misjudgement was pretty serious.

You took no accountability in getting fired from your first job.  I wouldn't put in a good word for you either.", "YTA and take this a hard lesson in life that you must learn from.  You aren't the kind of person that people are willing to vouch for and time to do some inner work and turn that around. \n\n Here you have two jobs, two different opportunities to prove that you are a great worker and reliable and all you can do is complain about them.  No one wants to be around, especially at work with that type of attitude.  \n\n Time to work hard and pay your dues but you are busy trying to get out of the consequences of your bad actions and expect everyone else to hel p you do it.", "YTA.

This says far more about your character than his.", "Yes, YTA. Based on your post history of what happened at your last job (calling in sick 5 days in a row because you\u2019d used all your PTO and wanted to take another vacation), I would NOT risk my reputation by recommending you for a job. Why in the world would he? He said you were free to apply on your own, and pushing back at all, much less the amount you did, getting his mom involved, etc. is well, well into AH territory. But it fits with your two posts about your former job where you continually make the excuse \u2018loads of ppl call in sick with the flu when they aren\u2019t because they didn\u2019t have any vacation time left\u2019 and totally refusing to accept any kind of responsibility for your actions. You need a reality check. There\u2019s a reason your bf\u2019s brother didn\u2019t intentionally bring the job up to/around you.", "By the way she got fired for calling in sick going on a Holiday and then being dumb enough to post it to social media.  Company labeled it gross miss conduct.  Lady if you call out sick on a Hiliday that's grounds at most companies to get fired for.  So no a reputable person at an agency doesn't want to give you a reference.", "YTA. You choose to call in sick and then go on vacation instead per your post history. I remember how you felt it wasn\u2019t your fault then. Why on earth should Kieran stick his neck out for you?

Why would he want to recommend someone who basically took  paid sick leave to go on holiday and had the audacity to say they had flu/chest infection.   You got fired because of your actions (you did say they took other unrelated actions /concerns into account, so it wasn't a one-time misjudgement) and lies.

No one has a responsibility to recommend you.", "YTA. I had my mind made up before I learned why you were fired and that really cemented it. You were fired for good reason and your boyfriend's brother shouldn't have to put his name on the line for your very bad judgement. You were an asshole for pushing for that and an asshole for not telling their mother why you were fired in the first place. Find a new job on your own merit while learning from the jobs you have now. Maybe you'll learn why your previous employer fired you for good reason", "After learning why you got fired, yeah, you deserve it. YTA, no shot I would recommend you for anything either. You treated a career like a normal job. Bozo.", "YTA.\n\nYou've said that you lost your job due to a \"misjudgement\" on your part. You consider that the company overreacted.  From your post history, it seems you falsely used sick leave to take a holiday which would essentially be gross misconduct/fraud.  \n\nIt is a lot to ask someone to recommend you for a job when they left their last job under a bit of cloud, let alone when they left under those circumstances. \n\nIf someone has worked with you, worked at the same company and know what the management and company practices are like, had a front row seat for what happen and believed you were unfairly sacked - yes, then they know what you are like and can recommend based on that knowledge without concern of risking their own reputation.  \n\nBut you were asking a personal acquaintance to recommend you in a work setting, when any subsequent issues could reflect badly on them, and when they know you have acted improperly in your previous job in that field .\n\nWhen Kieran refused your request for a recommendation, you should have accepted it and done what he suggested and tried applying through the normal channels.\n\nAnd frankly, given what your post history indicates about what happened in your previous job and given Kieran's concerns and clear attempt to dissuade you from applying, I think you should thank your stars he's saying to you apply but I won't recommend you, because Kieran could easily have been having a quiet word with the hiring manage to advise against you.", "It\u2019s been 12 days and you\u2019re already tapping into your savings?

Find a job in your career path on your own and don't look to others to sacrifice their careers for your benefit when you inevitably do the same thing you did in the past then get him fired and imagine the rift in the family you'll cause then.", "YTA\n\nThere is a lot of entitlement from OP here. Even if you were married to your BF, his brother is allowed to use his judgement and not recommend you where he works. Kudos to OP for admitting that there is a \"there there\" and she is trying to move past it. But your pseudo-BIL is not required to overlook whatever happened. He might have done a recommendation if he had seen a change in OP since losing the professional job. But it's only been a few weeks.\n\nI also get the impression that OP doesn't live with her BF. Thus they are not financial partners and I wonder how long the relationship has been going on. Instead of looking to pseudo-BIL for help look to BF. \n\nAlso, BF Dave isn't putting OP in for a recommendation. I'd focus on that lack of support over the brother. \n\nHope everything eventually works out for you OP.", "Yta. Sorry but there are very very few people I would put my neck on the linr to recommend for a job. I don't know the story of why you were fired, I'm guessing Keiran does have more insight and that makes him not comfortable putting in a recommendation for you to get the job and that is perfectly fair. His reputation in the company is on the line. \n\nNow if he actually tries to prevent you getting the job, that is anothwr thing entirely and he would be an ah also. It's ok to not recommend you and simply stay out of the hiring process entirely, it's another if he tells them his opinion of you.", "YTA You fucked up and you think he should put his neck on the line for you?? You\u2019re a bigger ah for blaming your previous company for overreacting when they fired you instead of acknowledging you deserved it.", "YTA, he was right to feel uncomfortable recommending you and you have proved that by your dreadful behaviour at dinner.", "YTA. You need to work some place else and demonstrate you can be a good employee. You were fired for cause and it is completely reasonable for someone to not want to recommend you.", "YTA. Why would he vouch for you and possibly put his own position in jeopardy when he has legitimate concerns about your work ethic? Having learned about the job now you can certainly apply, but you should have graciously backed off when he shut you down. I think it\u2019s clear your boyfriend and his brother both have a real problem with how your last job played out and it\u2019s wrong to think they have an obligation to get you a job just because you want it.", "YTA. Read your other posts and you were fired for something is actually a big deal. And from your various comments, you still seem to think that what you did was not really a problem. So I would have trouble recommending you for a job because if you did some asshole move like that, it would make me look bad.  That does not mean BF\u2019s brother doesn\u2019t like you or wish you well, just that he sees too much risk in you coming to work on his referral. His parents probably do not fully understand that risk and so you created a family fight by asking for him to do something that could hurt his career. It\u2019s fine to have asked once, but you should have read the room and realized it was not going to happen rather than persisting. Then you could have talked to him offline, gotten his explanation, and maybe learned a lesson that there are serious consequences for committing fraud in life. Not everyone gets caught, but that does not mean you should do it too.", "YTA you asked that's fine. But he has a right to refuse. He already helped his brother maybe he just doesn't want to be seen as the one who always wants extra treatment for family, maybe you really fucked up at your old job (which you give no details) and he for a reason is not vouching for you with his name. Fact is, after he declined once, twice, you let it go not cause a whole drama. Noone owes you a job or vitamin b.", "YTA. Idk what you did that caused you to be fired, but just reading this interaction tells me that it was probably deserved. There\u2019s a reason I stopped recommending people to work at the same place I\u2019m at, and it\u2019s because they may be a great friend or a good person, but have crappy work ethics and that blows back on me.", "YTA. You tried to keep why you lost your job vague but now that I see multiple posts about how you faked being sick to use sick leave to take vacation it's understandable why neither of them will want to put their jobs in jeopardy for you. You are selfish. You expect others to do favors for you and you try to claim it as family and helping each other out. Yet your track record shows you would not be a good employee and them having vouched for you would only make them look bad.  You don't care about their well-being which the brother stated.", "YTA and from your previous post history not learning from your mistakes at all, you have asked him for a recommendation knowing full well you've been sacked for gross misconduct.

My company overreacted, in my opinion, and dismissed me. I\u2019ve had to accept this and move on but it\u2019s been hard.\n\nTo keep afloat, I\u2019ve got 2 minimum wage jobs in unrelated areas. I\u2019ve only just started them and already absolutely hate them! They are boring and brutal, I\u2019m quickly eating into savings and I\u2019m desperately looking for something similar to before. I\u2019m applying for jobs but nothing yet. It\u2019s awful atm and I\u2019m really worried.  \n\nMy BF \u201cDave\u201d and his older brother \u201cKieran\u201d both work at the same company, but in different functions. Kieran is more senior and has been there longer. Dave hasn't been there long and got the job through his brother.\n\nWe went to his parents for dinner the other night. Kieran and his GF were there too. I\u2019ve always got on well with all of them and they know my situation and have generally been supportive.\n\nIt came out (accidentally, which stung a bit) that there is a vacancy at their company, similar to my previous job.  \n\nI asked about it and Dave couldn\u2019t help, hadn\u2019t known about it, didn\u2019t know the people involved or what the job was.  \n\nKieran did know and could have helped but was non-committal and vague but I kept asking and he provided more details. I thought I could definitely do it and was really enthusiastic.\n\nI asked him if I could apply and he wasn\u2019t keen at all and said he didn\u2019t think it was a good fit and  not my thing.  He knows anything would be at the moment!  \n\nI said it sounded perfect and I wanted to apply and asked him to put a good word in for me. He still didn\u2019t sound happy about it and kept making lame excuses. \n\nHe said it was a different department, he wasn\u2019t the hiring manager and couldn\u2019t influence it, I was free to apply but he couldn\u2019t really recommend me. I asked why not as he\u2019d recommended Dave for a job in a different department. Then his mum got involved, backing me up, saying family  was important and I was a great worker. \n\nHe argued for a bit with us, then said he\u2019d not had concerns about Dave, he did about me! After everything that\u2019s happened, and thinking he was on my side, wow! I got annoyed and probably shouted a bit and asked him what he meant.\n\nHe said I had a work ethic and attitude problem and I didn\u2019t get fired for nothing and he wasn\u2019t prepared to harm his own career recommending someone who he had concerns about!  He said family loyalty also meant me not harming him at work! I couldn't believe it and said so. His mum agreed with me and there was a big row, us v Kieran.\n\nThen Dave also got involved and asked his mum to back off and me to leave it which was even more hurtful.\n\nWe left soon after and Dave is now annoyed with me for \u2018causing\u2019 the fight. All I\u2019m trying to do is get back on my feet and be given another chance and I feel so unsupported. We had another fight and he blames me for that.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He is right not to risk his professional reputation by recommending a bad hire.", "OP going off your comments it seems reasonable to assume that any reference from the employer that sacked you is going to mention at least the fact that you had a disciplinary on your record which will then invite further questions from a new potential employer. \n\nSo with this in mind can you think about the position Kieran was in when you asked for a recommendation? Credit to him he was honest with you. Personally I\u2019d have taken the easy way out with you, I\u2019d have lied and said \u201csure I\u2019ll give you a recommendation you just send in your application and I\u2019ll be sure to mention how good you are\u2026\u201d and then I\u2019d have just stayed quiet and let your application get rejected on its own. \n\nThere is no way he can recommend you for a position without admitting to them that you were fired because if he doesn\u2019t when they find out they will want to know either why he hid it from from or why if he knows you well enough to recommend that he didnt know what you did. \n\nHe cannot come out of this unscathed but it very much seems like you\u2019re a drowning person determined to take down anyone who gets close enough to you and the situation and you\u2019ll justify it to yourself and others because you clearly think it was unfair that you were fired. \n\nYTA because you fucked yourself and now you\u2019re fucking with your BF\u2019s family.", "YTA.

Looking at your previous posts about being sacked, you alluded to a there being a 'few other things taken into account' when you were dismissed for skiving. I imagine that if your BF's bro is aware of or suspects there were additional reasons for your sacking given his comments, there's no way he'd back you with the potential to negatively affect his reputation by association.

You may not like them, but it's been a couple of weeks, so suck it up or pester your agency, or another one, for something different.

He can be supportive of you in your struggle and provide guidance and insight to your situation while not jeopardizing his own reputation at work. I think the core takeaway for you is to realize that your past blunder was a learning experience for you, and will hopefully help you realize that lying and using sick days for a vacation is taken very seriously by employers. Once you understand the severity of that action you can start to rebuild people\u2019s perception of your work ethic and trust, so others will be comfortable enough to recommend you for jobs within their companies and tie their reputation to yours as their recommendation.

That's not misjudgement. Yes plenty of people call im sick when they're not but 5days for a vacation and then blast it on SM? You're just not the smartest. Also we can see your post history. Technology is not your strong point is it?", "YTA- not for asking about a job, but for asking his help to get it. You screwed up at your last job and still don\u2019t seem to fully grasp the significance of your actions, as you consider using sick leave to go on vacation a simple \u201cmisjudgment\u201d and the penalty of firing an overreaction.

That wasn't a smart move on his part, even though it seems to have worked out so far.\n\nNo one I know who values their reputation actually recommends people to their employer.  Maybe when you're kids working part-time retail gigs and not what you're doing with the rest of your life, but adults with long-term jobs/careers?  Nope.  You may know someone personally, but have no clue about their work ethic or how they behave in the workplace or truly what their professional strengths and weaknesses are.  It is a really easy way to get burned when you personally vouch for someone to your employer.  You're known by the company you keep.  Even if no one personally blames him if something goes sideways with you or with Dave - it's an association that people will have in their head.\n\nAdd in that Kieran actually KNOWS that you behaved unprofessionally at your last place of employment and he'd have to be head up his arse stupid to recommend you.\n\nApply for the job, try to get it on your own merits, and apologize to Kieran for continuing to push the issue because you overstepped.", "YTA for the pushiness alone.

Work on yourself and be honest with yourself about what happened. You lied about being sick to take a vacation. You understand that kind of thing casts a bad light on all employees, right?

If your BF's brother vouched for you and you pulled the same crap you did that caused you to get fired it would absolutely affect his reputation and standing within the company.

Then you claim to have dwindling savings because of this when you were so recently FIRED from your job that your final paycheck probably hasnt entered into your bank account.

In audit/ year end season, I've worked with people who regularly worked 60+ weeks, weekends while studying for exams. \n\nI know of one firm who force their employees to take a week off in December so that most won't be able to carry over holidays to next year and also to use the week off as justification for denying vacation requests until April.", "It's such an *insult*. I've had employees flake out on me but I was 100% more upset when they told very bad lies to me about it. Do you think I'm a moron?", "Same, same. I think everyone has called out sick when they just wanted a day off before. But the key is to be careful about it. Don't post online anything indicating you're anywhere but at home, resting--though really it's safest to just not post anything that day--and if you do go out, make sure you're not going anywhere your coworkers or bosses are going to be. Years ago I knew someone who got in a lot of shit because she called in sick and then got caught by her boss while she was shopping with her friends in the same mall she worked in. Like.

I wouldn't do it either.", "Op is in the UK and already used their 25 paid vacation days and had 6 paid bank holidays.  I think OP would have been allowed to take the day unpaid.  Their sick days aren't for I need a day in 12 weeks to go to the dentist ( they can use a paid day, flex time etc for that) the sick days are for really being sick and from my understanding somebody who calls off sick two or three times a year won't ever be hassled for using those days. \n\nI worked for a couple companies that would pay you at the end of the year if you had unused sick/ personal days, they wanted to encourage people to not call out/ take days during black out times.", "I'll even take it a step further, be the kind of employee that the bosses don't want to fire and you can even get caught and still have a good chance of not getting fired. Having shitty work ethic and an attitude problem can be the difference between getting fired vs getting written up when you play fast and loose with PTO to sneak in a little vacation.", "In the case of the OP, it wasn't accrued Sick Days. They called in sick 5 days in a row while they were on vacation.\n\nThat's a lot worse than using Sick Days for vacation (which is also bad though).", "And not ne stupid enough to make social media posts about it!", "5 for a foreign holiday is a level beyond.

OP isn't overly bright", "Just from the way she responded to the brother, she says she \"May have shouted\"...\n\nlike yeah, this woman doesn't take accountability for herself, and thinks it's ok to yell at other people for being honest after she badgered him into talking about something he was clearly trying to avoid.\n\nShe sounds exceedingly entitled.  Work ethic issues indeed!", "Yeah, I can see the tiktoks now! I'm surprised the boyfriend is putting up with this. Most likely OP will be fired from her new \"jobs\" for similar behaviour.\n\nAlso, I don't think these jobs are real or at least haven't started yet. In 7 days she has supposedly started 2 jobs and worked at least 1 shift. Unless they were trial shifts in bars or mom and pop places, I can't see how she has had these jobs.

I'd be fully honest with the company at first that they didn't ask me to be a reference and it made me uncomfortable that they'd expect that without asking. Then out of some combination of me being blunt by nature, surprise, and not being very charitable out of anger over the boundary violation, I'd give the most full account of the person I could. And yes if they legit had some good work traits I'd likely mention it, but I might also have picked up on elements of the person's character they weren't so aware of themselves and wouldn't want me voicing to an employer", "It\u2019s much less understandable when OP is in the UK and already gets 5 weeks paid holiday. It\u2019s really not considered ok here", "My company has combined sick and vacation but they do roll over from year to year. I get 25 days PTO (I\u2019ve been with the company over 15 years) plus 4 floating holidays that don\u2019t roll over. I\u2019ve *never* used the entire yearly allowance, so I have a large accumulation of PTO (which they cap at 500 hours). I can\u2019t even imagine wanting or needing to take a week off every 2.5 months.", "OP is from the UK.", "I'm in the UK. Paid annual leave/holiday time is exactly that, and everyone gets a minimum of 28 days per year. Sick leave is different. We can self-certify for paid sick leave of up to a week, anything more than that requires a doctor's certificate. If you self-certified for a week and you weren't ill and went on holiday, you could expect to be sacked. If you're signed off by a doctor on long term sick, you can go on holiday - abroad if you like - but you need to let your employer know.", "It depends on what cause of sickness she used. In my workplace if you go off with covid or stomach bug etc you\u2019re expected to not be out and about and can face consequences at work if you\u2019re spotted going out. Mental health issues or some injuries like arm or leg breaks people typical are more forgiving of if it\u2019s true. I broke my arm a few years ago and in one HR meeting I was told to make sure I don\u2019t hole up at home just in case my mental health tanks due to the isolation. Posting photos of you online when you\u2019re meant to be on sick leave always raises eyebrows either way. I can see why BIL would be wary of recommending someone that has taken advantage of sick leave and shown no real responsibility for their actions. OP sounds a little work shy. \n\nSo OP YTA. Sort out your work ethic now or stay stuck in service jobs for a lot longer.", "Typically, employers have discretion to grant or not grant vacation based on operational requirements, while they are more limited in their discretion to grant sick leave (in Canada in any event). I\u2019ve seen employers be lax with sick leave (for example when a child or a spouse is sick as opposed to the employee themselves), or allow an employee use whatever paid leave bank they had available to cover an emergency, but the key is transparency.\n\nI\u2019m betting OP was denied vacation, then called it suck to go in it anyway. That\u2019s typically the number one reason my clients discipline their employees re sick leave.", "In the US it depends on the company. Some just give you paid time off that you can use for sick or holiday at your discretion. Others have designated sick and vacation days. The big difference between the two are generally sick days are a use it or lose it station, while vacation days you can carry over from one year to another.", "It depends. Some places have PTO, which is for sick or personal leave. Other places have separate sick and personal leave. My husband, for example, gets unlimited sick leave but has a prescribed number of personal days. If he were to use sick days for a vacation, it would be dishonest and abusing the system. However, at his last job, he had PTO. So it would have been weird to lie about being sick given both kinds of leave came out of the same days, but if he had lied, he wouldn\u2019t have hurt anyone.", "No, at my job if you take sick time immediately before or after vacation time your vacation time gets cancelled and converted to sick time or u paid LOA. And using sick time for vacation is at the very least punishable even in my union job.", "In the US, the 2 questions an employer is allowed to answer is confirming the date of employment and if they are eligible for rehire. \n\nIn this case, eligible for rehire would be a no, which is a big red flag.", "Good point. I\u2019m not thinking clearly. Lol.  I don\u2019t think you can give a bad reference in the US either, just confirm employment dates.", "Actually just checked and you\u2019re quite right, my mistake. 36 counting the 8 bank holidays. I thought we get more of those than we do.", "Well tbf, being hungover is a sick day lol", "3 weeks to start is not common in the US. I  have worked in \"high-stress\" industries for most of my career, so 3 weeks is fairly standard, but people are always shocked when I tell them how much vacation I get.\n\nMany companies offer 1 week your first year and some even only offer vacation after working a full year.", "Except op is in the UK and has statutory holiday of 20-odd days plus bank Holidays. Plenty of time for holidays and could have taken unpaid leave but chose to take paid sick leave (which most people don't get!)", "Exactly\u2026there\u2019s a difference between calling out sick as a mental health day where you just rest at home, or maybe you go get a massage or something, and taking off for a multi day holiday. And honestly if you\u2019re dumb enough to post about it on social, you deserve to be fired.", "I'm a manager and I've had a situation like this multiple times, where it came out either right before or right after that an employee had booked sick time for vacation. For employees that are doing fine, I literally don't care. A day or two here or there can make them feel like naughty geniuses and they won't feel the need to press elsewhere. However, they've never done anything as stupid as post on social media or brag about their vacation. I also encourage them to take their sick days as mental health days if they need them, Or if they're dealing with a personal issue that doesn't fall under technically vacation or sick time (I had a employee who wanted to attend a court with a family member for example, he's an exemplary employee and it would have really stressed him out not to be there but he hadn't decreed vacation time after the holidays).\n\nAn important part of being an adult and exercising good judgment is knowing when It's okay to bend the rules and what the difference between bending and breaking is.", "In my experience it usually happens because you know the company won't let you take those days off. ie not enough notice, black out dates, someone else is already out those days, etc. Vacation is booked and you're between a rock and a hard place.", "Wait, WHAT???? Employees in the UK get 25 vacation days and 6 bank holidays and that STILL wasn\u2019t enough for OP? She needed 5 MORE?!?  Do you know how few most of us in the US get???

Man I'd love to have that.  Here in the US companies say \"You already have 104 days off a year, they're called weekends LOL why would you pay you to take more off?!\" and then ask you to sign here to get hired on.  Ah, America.", "Correct me if I'm wrong but in the UK if you caught COVID 3 times in a year you could take 10 days off in a row, with a Drs   sign off, all 3 times and be paid for all 30 days plus still get your normal paid leave.", "My company specifically allows us to take sick leave to care for a sick child or partner. I\u2019ve also been known to use a sick day here and there as a mental health day, when I just couldn\u2019t stand the thought of working and knew if i went anyway I wouldn\u2019t be productive at all.
