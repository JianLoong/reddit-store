My dad and her mom met at a school event a couple of years ago and they got married this year due to an oops baby.  Since her dad isn\u2019t in the picture and my mom is overseas for work for a few years, the living situation has gotten weird and Amy and her mom haven\u2019t done much to make that any better.\n\nI could tell Amy hated the whole idea of our parents being together from the start, and I thought it was just that she didn\u2019t like all the changes. I didn\u2019t know until later that it was partly because of me.  She makes a lot of comments about me being \u201cMiss Perfect\u201d and how everyone caters to me because I\u2019m pretty.  I think I\u2019m average at best, I play sports so I stay in shape but I\u2019m nothing special and I can\u2019t do makeup to save my life.  Since we all moved in together, though, she has something snarky to say every time I do well at something or go out with friends or anything.  I\u2019m in honors classes and AP because the teachers pass me easy because I\u2019m a suck up and an athlete.  I get invitations and out of school opportunities because of my looks.  My friends are all dumb jocks. People only like me because I\u2019m pretty.  It\u2019s really annoying and the parents wouldn\u2019t do anything about it except just laugh it off so I finally snapped at her about it and said not even being pretty would make up for her ugly personality, so maybe she should work on herself instead of me.\n\nShe screamed at me and her mom got mad and told me I was being cruel.  My dad did stick up for me, but told me later in private that Amy has a rough time socially and is depressed and feels bad because I\u2019m really high performing at school and people compare her to me now. He asked if I would try to not be as obvious about doing better than her, and I should stay home more or include her in more stuff so she feels better.\n\nI told him I\u2019m just living my life and I\u2019m not going to do anything different just because she\u2019s jealous. I don\u2019t want to hang out with her because she\u2019s mean and my friends don\u2019t deserve that.  The best I\u2019m going to do is ignore her from now on since she gets to throw shots but sucks too much to take one back now and then.\n\nIt\u2019s causing a lot of stress and my step-mother says I\u2019m a stuck-up brat.  My dad has been trying to keep me home more, but I told him keeping me out of my clubs is going to look awesome for college scholarships so he\u2019s frustrated.

However, that will heavily depend on your step sisters ability to reconcile her negative feelings towards you. If she's unwilling to work with you about how your existence makes her feel, then it's not possible to work with her.\n\n Sure, you could drop your activities, isolate yourself, and flunk your classes, but what would that accomplish? She's likely going to still feel bad about herself, or she'll feel superior to you having won this. Both create an unhealthy relationship where her self worth is dependent on comparison.

I took all upper level classes and extra science electives because I wanted to, and took AP when that was an option because I wanted to. My twin is plenty smart but he has trouble sitting still, so he would occasionally take an on-level class because it still gets you to graduation at the end and that\u2019s more time for sports. He would never in a million years have asked me to stop taking upper level classes or quit orchestra just because he didn\u2019t do those things. I would never in a million years would have asked for him to stop being the star of the football team or to act like he had less friends to make me feel better. That\u2019s not how confident people act. \n\nYour step sister\u2019s problem isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s her own lack of confidence.

Amy is acting ridiculous, and your dad should know better then to try to make caretaking her feelings into your responsibility. I'm sad that your mom isn't willing to cash in a chip to go hard on your dad, or start a plan to get reassigned from overseas. Are there any family or friends in your school district that you can stay with in case things blow up again and you need some space from your family?\n\nA little tip from someone who grew up with an Amy-like relative long ago. The fact that you are humble about your achievements, don't wear makeup, and don't \"try\" to be pretty and popular doesn't humanize you to Amy. Part of her resentment is wrapped up in how \"natural\" it is for you, and her fears that she is intrinsically unlikeable. She likely feels great shame for being cruel to you, and that compounds her self loathing. I suspect your step mother thinks that unconditional love and support will release Amy from that cycle, but it sounds like that approach isn't working. You don't deserve this treatment. Amy doesn't have to love you, but you deserve basic respect and consideration. Just like everyone else.\n\nAmy is still young. She may grow to regret every cruel she ever said and strive to be family with you for real. (She might not, too.) Your parents won't be around forever, and there may come a day when you are the only family she has. Think of the long game now. It might help if you reminded your dad and step mom of that fact too. (Although it might also not, your step mom might double down on unconditional forgiveness.)\n\nSome final tips. Doing favors for Amy won't force her to respect you. Any adult who says otherwise is lying to you and themselves. If anything, the opposite is true. \n\nI have always had mixed results with ignoring people like Amy. That tactic works well when you have the freedom to walk away, like with an aggressive drunk at a bar. It's less effective against someone who lives in your house and who you cannot escape. Adults recommend that kids ignore their bullies because they forget what it's like. Trust me that if an adult Amy treated a coworker like at _most_ modern workplaces, she would get in deep trouble . (Fellow adults: please do not reply with \"someone acted like Amy at my last job and my boss did nothing!\" because i italicized \"most\" for a reason. I use the example of a workplace because it's the closest most adults come to a person you are forced to interact with for hours every day.) Plus i feel like being silent and nonreactive against abuse over a long period of time does subtle psychic damage. Especially if you are aware that you are abused because you are \"better\" then your abuser. \n\nOne fun thing you can do to stand up for yourself without getting in trouble is to \"agree\" with her in a mocking way. \"Yes, my friends are dumb jocks. Marcus is taking AP French and Jasmine tutors kids in math. Not a single one has won even one Nobel prize!\" Especially effective if there are witnesses who can chuckle at your wit and enrage her more.\n\nEven flatly \"agreeing \" with her without added snark  would allow you to stand up for yourself while looking innocent. \"You're a suck up!\" \"Okay\" \"People only like you because you're pretty!\" \"Sure.\" Try it once or twice and see how she reacts, i promise it is entertaining.\n\nGood luck, OP. I'm rooting for you!", "You are NTA. Please, encourage your dad to suggest your stepsister get counseling. And that is the only thing I would agree to do with her.

What are her interests?\n\nDo you have any common interests you could include her in?\n\nIt\u2019s easy when someone sees someone they feel is \u201cbetter\u201d than them for them to assume that other person FEELS they are better and looks down on them.\n\nThis is almost NEVER the case as even talented people don\u2019t always recognize they are and still have their own insecurities.\n\nIf you could (without being too obvious), slowly start a campaign of boosting Amy\u2019s self esteem by showing her her own worth, and that you are NOT \u201cperfect in every way\u201d (like she seems to think) it would make your life SO much easier and you might have a profoundly positive effect on Amy\u2019s life.\n\nBecause clearly she is miserable and, if her attitude doesn\u2019t improve, she will have an unhappy life.

Go to a colormebeautiful session together\u2014finding the right colors for your skin tone can boost confidence and save a lot on choosing clothing\u2014and it\u2019s fun. \n\nGrownups punishing this type of bully is a short term solution.

In the end you still may not like each other, but both can gain long lasting respect.", "Yarp, as someone struggling with depression and life in general, it absolutely does not excuse being an AH to people.

Are they praising her good aspects or just affirming her low-opinions of herself when they let her blow off steam? Are they cultivating her interests and figuring out ways to help her grow? The magical answer can\u2019t be to expect OP to swallow more shit because her happy life allows her to digest it better.", "Amy sounds pretty narcissistic.", "this! I found the dad's reaction mindboggling!! to tell his own daughter to stay home more and not to be so good at school?! so he wants to isolate his own daughter and maybe even lessen her chances of getting into a good school later on because his step daughter is insecure?!

And how did he not stand up to protect his daughter when she was insulted prior to that incident? Ask him how he would feel if a similar situation was happening to him. He needs to realise just how much pain this is causing and how much resentment you are going to have for him in the future if he prioritises his new wife and step daughter. \nYou are NTA, and am really sorry this is happening to you.", "Indeed, it feels like a cop out that your mom is just telling you to ignore it when there's no possibility of you ignoring this when there are three people in one of the houses you live in going after you.", "Actually she was quoting the snarky and mean things her stepsister says.

She is jealous and she is BULLYING you!  \n\nAs you stated your athletic and you get good grades because you put in the work.  Amy doesn't.  That's on her.
