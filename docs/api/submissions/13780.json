Of course we have these ups and downs like any relationship does, but April fools was coming around the corner. In my head, I thought we were going to be civil and not do pranks on each other because personally I am not a good prankster. I went to my bf house today and I was in his room, he was in the bathroom. I had him phone in my hand because I was looking at some TikTok\u2019s. Next thing I know a girl was texting him. In my\nPast relationships, I\u2019ve gotten cheated on tons of times and I really have a lot of trust in my bf. I open the text that the girl sent and it says \u201cwhen can we link?\u201d. My heart starts pumping out of my chest and I start to shake.\u201d I low key started having a panic attack and I start scrolling through all the other messages that there were. There were a lot  of flirty text messages, you know. So I get up, put his phone in my pocket and go over to his sister, who mind you is in the living room. I go to her and show her the profile and say \u201chey, do you know this girl?\u201d. She says no and I knew immediately that I knew what was happening. I go and show my bf all the texts and asks him what it is. He acts so stupid and I start reading them out loud. As I am still shaking and my heart is still coming out my chest. I ask him to grab my phone and I start crying to my mom. This was about the most embarrassing thing ever. My bf starts screaming it\u2019s a joke and calls his brother and they both start screaming April fools while they laugh. I was sitting there crying while they were both laughing. I start screaming at my bf that this is not funny and I am hurt. I just couldn\u2019t stop crying at that point. I called my dad to come and get me and he did. While I was waiting for my dad to come get me I was sitting there on his bed balling my eyes out, idk why but I just couldn\u2019t stop. He was sitting across from me and had his feet up on his phone, watching me wipe my own tears. During this time he was just watching me cry and talking about how dramatic I was. Then,my dad showed up. As I was walking out the door, my bfs aunt says \u201cI am so sorry baby\u201d. I walked out. I haven\u2019t answered his texts or calls.

You meant ex-boyfriend, right?", "Definitely not the asshole.  Jesus, what an awful idea your boyfriend has.  \n\nTricking someone into thinking they're being cheated on is like punching someone in the face and telling them \"April Fools!\"  In fact, I think a lot of people would rather be punched in the face than have that happen to them.", "He probably ia really cheating thats not  a prank i think that you deserve so much better. It sounds like he used april fools to voer his cheating when he got caught. Im so sorry he is horrible for doing this but you will be better off without him trust me girl", "NTA\n\nThis isn't a prank; it's cruel and stupid. \n\nIt's up to you if you think you want to forgive him and continue to be together, but I also wouldn't blame you if you ended the relationship over this.", "NTA. You said there were other texts, flirty ones.  Going back how far? How did he know you'd see it on his phone, since you have your own?  I wouldn't be quick to buy the prank answer yet.\n\nQuite frankly if it is a prank it was in poor taste and given your history he should know better", "Definitely NTA. That\u2019s just mean.", "NTA. id honestly break up with someone if they tried to pull that bs", "NTA - and it probably wasn\u2019t a prank.", "NTA - This is traumatic. Like your aunt, I'm so sorry.", "Not the asshole. If there was a pre-existing understanding that any out of the ordinary thing happening that day were a prank that would be one thing, but in my mind, intentionally toying with someone's emotions isn't much of a prank regardless of what day it lands on", "NTA Arrange to meet at a restaurant and talk it out. And then don\u2019t go. Because pranks are fun yo!", "NTA. Break up with the immature jerk.", "Ex-boyfriend.  He needs to be your ex-boyfriend.", "NTA. Did no one learn anything from that SpongeBob episode? Smh.\n\nIn all seriousness though there have been too many posts today about these \u201cpranks\u201d that are just straight up torture. There was one that caused the op to have a literal panic attack.\n\nI really don\u2019t like jumping to the whole \u201cyou should dump them\u2026 but when the shoe fits\u2026.\u201d If someone claimed to love me and did this, I\u2019d just assume they\u2019re a liar. The fact that he just sat there afterwards just adds gas to the fire.", "NTA but sounds like he was cheating and he was a complete jerk along with the rest of his family. I'd dump him and dodge that bullet. There are plenty of better fish in the sea.", "YTA for staying with a man who called you dramatic when having a panic attack and crying, and not apologizing for causing you such distress.", "NTA\n\nDoes he usually treat you well? Is there a chance his brother and he got together to come up with a prank and he went along with a bad suggestion? Has he been rude or cruel to you before? \n\nI\u2019m the first in line to say dump them at the first red flag. But if you are teenagers then your judgment isn\u2019t fully formed (25 years old for that), and this might not be how he usually is with you. But if he doesn\u2019t treat you like you\u2019re special, then absolutely dump him. \n\nIf you decide to stay with him, keep your eyes wide open to his negative qualities and how he treats you. Love is blind, so be sure to look out for yourself and stay aware of how he treats you, the good and the bad. Also pay attention to feedback about him that you get from other people, because they are objective. \n\nBut for him to laugh while you cried is just awful. It would be ok to dump him for this.", "Awful idea by the boy friend but I\u2019d give him another chance unless this is a recurring theme of bad jokes at your expense", "YTA\u2026 for putting a in front of April fools instead of an.

How did he know that you would be looking at his phone? Who sent the messages? Why do they go back so far if this was just a one day prank? Why did he play dumb at first rather than coming clean right away?  \n\n\nIf this was a prank, it's a mean one, but if you want to try to move past this, make him PROVE it's a prank. NTA", "NTA and sounds like an ex-boyfriend too me. You deserve better than this.", "NTA, pranks are something everyone laughs about after..that is not what this was no matter how he tries to spin it AND gaslight you. It was cruelty dear. You deserve better, dump his ass.", "I haven\u2019t talked to him, he has been blowing up my phone though\u2026", "The texts were not even a day old, they were a couple hours before I had come over. I really don\u2019t know what was going through his mind, but I really didn\u2019t put a lot into this story. There was way more that happened, sadly", "LOL this is the funniest response ever! I will take u up on that advice \ud83d\ude02", "He usually does treat me great, we both just fall in with eachother, I do think he went with a bad suggestion of from his brother because I take up most of my bfs time. I really don\u2019t know but I do know that his whole family cussed them both out and they got in so much trouble. Well deserved", "I am sorry!!! I should have reread, kinda a lot \ud83d\ude22", "It was his brother sending the messages, they were only a couple hours back before I came over and I guess he did know I was going to look because the phone was open\u2026 idk what was going through his mind.", "If you\u2019re at near a year together and he doesn\u2019t understand why this was a bad idea, you should block him and move on. It\u2019s only a good prank if everyone is laughing. So sorry this happened to you.", "Be done with him.  Pranks should be funny. They shouldn't make you cry.  You can do better \u2764\ufe0f", "Idk his reaction and how he treated you when the prank obviously went wrong doesn't sound like he treats you well/ takes care of you emotionally. For one my boyfriend would never in a million years thing playing at a deep insecurity of mine is funny, but TWO!!! If he somehow did try to prank me and it went so poorly that it made me have a panic attack he would be doing everything possible to try and comfort me. Your BF sucks, he made it seem pretty clear he doesn't care.", "It\u2019s totally fine I was just trying to be funny, kind of, maybe?

What a horrible family. Would you want to have them bring it up constantly in the future for their entertainment, going on about how funny it was and how sensitive and dramatic you are? You've wasted a year, don't waste anymore time on such an immature, cruel boy.", "INFO: what about the aunty's comment?", "The aunt's comment indicates that she recognises just how cruel the bf was, how badly the 'joke' went down, and just how much OP was hurting.", "Rereading it, it could have been a genuine comment, but when first reading it, I took it in a condescending way. If it was said in a nice way and the aunt genuinely felt for her, then I hope she ripped into her nephews about their behaviour!"]}
