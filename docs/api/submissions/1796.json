AFTER. I didn't do anything to them. I spoke with this woman AND her teen she sent. \n\nSo my neighbors right next door used to live in the house I am in now. They lived here for like 12 years or so I'm not really sure. Between then and now there was another family living here so it's been easily around 8 years they haven't lived in this house, at this address. Right after we moved in they had a package sent here. Its odd to me but the lady sends her teenager to pick up the package on a four wheeler. Fast forward about 6 months I am heavily pregnant and there's another package. I drive it to her house and she apologizes with a smirk and says she changed it. Two days later another package. All from the same company. I sent it back to the post office out of annoyance. Kid comes back and asks, I tell him. Another 8 months or so goes by and there's another TWO packages. She had over a year to change her address on their website and still didn't so I started throwing anything else that was sent to my address away. They have two \"yee yee trucks\" and for an entire year after they would rev incredibly loud pulling out of the driveway (I'm right up against the road) until the mom saw me out in the front yard playing with my son and it hasn't happened since.

It got thrown away.", "I would've changed my address after the first package.", "Unless it\u2019s USPS delivering, from any other carrier it isn\u2019t illegal.

After the very last occurance.", "Tampering with mail in the US is a federal crime with up to 10 years in prison.", "Yeah, I\u2019m getting that vibe too. The fact that it\u2019s only *one* company that\u2019s still mailing to this address (again, after about 10 years that the neighbor hasn\u2019t lived there) makes it seem like they specifically *don\u2019t* want those packages coming to their address.", ">I'm saying NTA to counterbalance all these yucksters saying Y T A\n\nWhat a stupid justification. \"Hurr durr, other people say one thing, so I say the other.

When you see somebody post about how much they hate somebody without being able to give concrete examples or with very trivial examples, that's a bitch eating crackers situation. With OP here, it's clear that the perceived smirk, the annoyance at all of \"TWO\" packages, and the truck complaints are mostly problems because she doesn't like them, not because they're super bad on their own.", "I've never heard of this phrase!!! Very useful to know...thank you...", "Ok so throw it in her driveway?", "I\u2019m guessing OP means her neighbors are rednecks ... maybe?

It is up to you to decide how you feel about your choices. \n\nBut think about how bloody exhausting a feud with your neighbor can be.

You nailed it!", "Pretty sure this is original MIL lore from the Baby  Center in-law complaint boards from back in the day.
