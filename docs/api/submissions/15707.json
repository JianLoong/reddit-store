Nope.\n\nI will say that if you snap and crack your gum loudly, it could be a bit grating to listen to, but I'm not assuming you do this.

It absolutely can cause health issues, is an addiction like basically anything else because it produces a reward signal for you \u201ceating\u201d and yeah like smokes it costs you, that\u2019s absolutely not something you need, it\u2019s disposable income that does not have to happen every week, small or big.", "Considering I don't personally have to hear the chewing noise your completely NTA", "It was never about the iranian gum", "NTA \n\nHe ain't no dentist, tell him to shut up.", "NTA and your boyfriend is being super controlling.
