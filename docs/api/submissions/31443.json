You said no to the dance offer.  Big clue #1\u2014he\u2019s not that into me.\n\nThen she invites you to her dorm room but doesn\u2019t explicitly say something like \u201cspeaking of anthropology class, would you ever like to read xyz?

Of course that's what she meant.", "NTA. You were being clear and upfront. Nothing wrong with that", "NTA.. I agree it sounds like she was back peddling to save from embarrassment she got turned down. Had she truly had stuff she wanted to show you she would have said that in the first place. Even then one could view it as a come on.", "NTA.  Protecting your relationship was the right thing to do.  If she wasn\u2019t after what is in your pants, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten mad.

If it was to show you something related to the innocent discussion, wouldn't she have specified that in the first place? Her comment was vague, so she left it open for interpretation.

You turn down a girl trying to hook up with you, she's going to call you an asshole to save face. Women don't like rejection!  NTA", "NTA - that was a sex invitation.

It was a weird interaction for sure, and ideally you maybe shouldn't have assumed that, but shit like that happens, and probably someone who wouldn't serve you well as a friend if she reacted like that.

It's not fair, but in our society women often get \"slut shamed\" for wanting sex. And rejection always hurts as well. Implying \"you want to sleep with me but I don't want to sleep with you\" is likely to make her feel bad on both counts. \n\nEven so, I'm not going with YTA. First, I think you were probably correct. And second, I don't get the sense that you were trying to hurt her feelings. But in the future, it'd be better to say \"No\" in a more face-saving way for her.

It's not all about girls wanting to have sex with you.", "NTA. But you could have been smoother about it and let everyone save face.
