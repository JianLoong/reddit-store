It\u2019s been fine, my side of the family (usually) gets together at my home. \n\nI don\u2019t want to have to be forced to be a part of family traditions. I think because this is second year in a row with a baby/toddler in tow. But, I\u2019m so done with packing all the bags and getting him in and out of the car seat every couple of hours because we have family that expect us to be at their homes. \n\nMine and my husband family are very different. Mine gather at my home, now that works out for me bevause it\u2019s a safer space for my toddler and he\u2019s familiar with it, we make food early so anyone can eat when they are feeling hungry, and we drink. His family get together a ate always at his moms, they all sit down to have dinner at 5 pm, and the only one that drinks is his stepdad, who has never once offered me a drink. \n\nMe and his mom are not that close, like texting each other to plan where we\u2019ll  be type of close. He talks to his mom regarding that stuff. Thanksgiving we spent with both families and it was rough, by the end of the night I just wanted to sleep and very not relaxed and what\u2019s supposed to be a happy peaceful evening. \n\nFor Christmas I told my husband let\u2019s spend Christmas Eve at home (with my family) and go to his moms on Christmas day so we won\u2019t be going to two houses in one day. I guess he didn\u2019t tell his mom with enough time because she because really sad when he told her. He said we would still go over for a little on Christmas Eve but just for a little since my family will be at our home (my mom lives with us so someone was there yes) I told him to let his mom. Know then that we would go over early Christmas Eve. She said she\u2019d prefer if we all ate dinner together at 5 pm. So that\u2019s what we did, we got ready, went over for about three hours, then came home to my family who had been waiting on us since they arrived. \n\nFor new years same thing. She wants us over eating dinner at 5 pm. We\u2019re having a new year ever party at my home tonight. So on top of planning, and cooking getting myself and Toddler ready all of our bags ready, still have to be over there smack dab in the evening. \n\nAm I an asshole? Next year I want to say I\u2019m making thanksgiving dinner all on my own and invite her over so we don\u2019t have to go anywhere. Does everyone feel this way and just suck it up when they have to go to multiple families houses on the holidays? Maybe I\u2019m trying to avoid mil since it\u2019s her home I\u2019m trying to avoid, every time we go over she never fails to mention how skinny my son looks from the time she\u2019s seen him before and asks if he\u2019s sick.", "created_utc": 1672495620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzuuil/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_husbands_moms/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They \\[in-laws\\] were welcome to drop by any time that week.", "OP, you are overthinking this.  You don\u2019t need to subject yourself to psychoanalysis to justify wanting to stay home for the holidays.  Young families are NOT obligated to travel to the grandparents\u2019 home every holiday.  Take charge of establishing your own routines and traditions, without apology.  NTA.\n\nA word of advice:  Decide with your husband what kind of relationships you want to have with your in-laws (including siblings), for yourself and your son, and then make a plan to achieve that.  Don\u2019t just let the tides carry you along and then wake up seeing that your child does not know most of his relatives, or that you have grown bitter and resentful.  Create a reminder calendar for yourselves of when to call, email and visit your family members.  Be intentional and consistent.  There are 365 days in the year, so use them all to your advantage.", "NTA. Your kid(s) will HATE this. My husband literally has childhood trauma from being carted around to 2+ houses every holiday instead of just getting to enjoy them.", "NTA. First, it sounds like you are the sole parent responsible for getting the toddler ready when you go somewhere. You shouldn\u2019t be in that position. Your husband needs to share equally in that responsibility. Second, your MIL needs to learn to be more flexible. Her son is married now with a young child so things are necessarily going to change. \n\nYou aren\u2019t in the wrong at all. Your husband needs to step up and explain that things have to change. I also would try to develop your own separate traditions so neither one of you feels as if you are at the whim of your families for every holiday.", "NTA. Everyone I know switches-one year with one side of the family, the second year with the other side. My BIL\u2019s family celebrates Christmas Eve, so they would spend Christmas Eve with his family and Christmas Day with my family. \n\nI think that\u2019s more reasonable. Perhaps for NYE this year, you should let your husband go to his mother\u2019s without you.", "NTA\n\nyou need to have a conversation with your husband and decide what you want to do for all holidays next year. \nDecide on Easter, thanksgiving and both Xmas days. That\u2019s four so it\u2019s easy to split them between the 2 families. \n\nDon\u2019t let him railroad you, hold your ground. If his parents have to see him every holiday then they can come to your house. \n\nOnce you two have come to a decision, then you have HIM tell his mom what the plan going forward is. \n\nAs an aside, I don\u2019t know if Xmas eve is the holiday your family usually gets together for, and to add yet another wrench into the mix, you might want to do Xmas day at home so your kid(s) don\u2019t have to leave their toys every Xmas. That\u2019s the one thing my h always said sucked!  \n\nAs for this NYE, there would be no way in hell I would be having 5 pm dinner and then coming home and hosting a party. That\u2019s insane. Send him to his moms for supper alone or with your son. They will survive not seeing you for a few hours.", "I think everyone hates it but early planning and communicating boundaries and expectations makes it bearable", "NTA. You and your husband and your baby are a family and it\u2019s time to begin your own traditions.", "NTA it is time for you to create your own path. You will not always be able to spend a holiday with either side. No Monroe back and forth.", "I think you all need to establish some sort of routine with his mother. Maybe every other holiday and switch it each year? My ex and I used to try to hit everyone on holidays and it was stressful enough having two adults do it. I can't even imagine throwing a child into the mix. If she's insistent about seeing you every holiday, I think finding compromises such as Christmas Eve at home, Christmas Day at in-laws is a good workaround. If that doesn't work for MIL, then this is probably a conversation to be had in a neutral place (park, restaurant, coffee shop, etc) and perhaps with a third-party as referee.", "NAH. You're living with your mom, whereas you have to make plans to see his family. Marrying means you need to find balance and compromise. You need to talk to your husband and make plans together about what you want the holidays to look like. If you know MIL has a dinner at 5pm, you can plan to eat early with your family. It's also reasonable to switch houses every other year on holidays or every other holiday, but your husband may want to be with his family on holidays as he lives with your family 365 days per year. Does his mom live far away from you all? If you're the only one with a kiddo, it may be better for you to host every other holiday. If there are others with kids, you have to decide how often you want to travel with the kiddo. Overall talk to your husband.", "NTA\n\n But you also may need to step in with communication with mom. Because it seems like you\u2019re telling you\u2019re husband one thing and he\u2019s telling his mom another thing. \n\nOr if hubby wants to go visit mom, he can take your son and go while you stay home with your family.", "NTA. Stick with the tradition of staying home. I hated every holiday because of being forced to go.", "NTA \n\nYou have the youngest family member, so your needs take precedence. As people age and families expand, traditions need to change with them. \n\nYour husband also needs to step up and do his part in caring for the toddler.", "NTA. Now that you have a child of your own, it\u2019s time to do your own \u201cat home\u201d traditions.", "NTA. You need to set some boundaries. Christmas Eve at your place, Christmas Day at theirs is perfectly fair or vice versa. Alternate Thanksgivings. Or better yet, on the years you host Thanksgiving at your place just invite your in laws too. Be together as one big family. Set that example.\n\nI get that you live with your mother so maybe your MIL needs a bit of extra care and I\u2019m all for that. But splitting every event down the middle the way you are now is too much and you shouldn\u2019t have to put yourself through it. \n\nAlso the business about your husband\u2019s stepfather having a drink and not offering it to others is very unpleasant. Next time you\u2019re at their place you should ask your husband to please bring a bottle of wine and serve some for the two of you and offer to others. Hopefully they\u2019ll get the hint on how inhospitable and weird that is. And if not and they just judge you for it then at least you\u2019ll have a glass of wine to help you through the night!", "I like how you softly drop your mother lives with you 365 days a year, which I am sure never causes any friction for your husband at the same time complaining about going to his mothers house twice a year.  \n\nOP is clearly immature and a bit entitled.   OP husband also has communication issues.  \n\nThis all could be resolved with some boundaries and having adult conversations with your parents.", "NTA, but yeah, you just gotta suck it up.  And take secret pride that you have the cool side of the family of course.", "YTA, with a little bit of ESH. A lot of it on your end sounds small and petty, e.g. I prefer to spend time with my family because they drink ; nobody offers me alcohol there and I\u2019m too whiny to bring my own, get my own, or ask for some ; they eat at a fixed time. Anyways, I think a big issue is that you host the holidays for your family and your mother lives with you, so staying at your house is not just neutral.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
