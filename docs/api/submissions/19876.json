This was my birthday and if it was to be made special you would have respected that.

Such a tragedy that family are usually our first abusers and ironic that strangers can offer love we never knew we deserved. Your cousin doesn't deserve anything nor anymore than you're willing to grant, including boundaries; she made her bed hard so she can lie in it hard. She was an abuser and deserves your boundaries.

I hope someday Grace will see how your parents were the ones that were disrespecting and harming you, by doing this to you.  They were horribly manipulating you, expecting your compliance, and for some bizarre reasons, decided that your celebration meal was the right time to confront you with a horrible abusive person from your past, knowing you would be harmed more by this.  How long they waited for reservations doesn't matter.  What your parents did was not loving or kind behavior.  It was manipulative and enabling the abuser, while trying to force you to comply, which would have hurt you even more.\n\n*and I could have just \"called a truce\" with Nancy for a few hours since she hadn't said or done anything to me then at the table.* \n\nWhat she did then is not the focus here.

Of course not.  Same thing.  You were treated that badly by this person.  A family that respects you as the person you are, would be supporting you in avoiding this person, not pushing her into your face like this.\n\n**Your parents' complicity in this is horrible.**  If Nancy showed up uninvited, they should have told her that it wasn't going to work out for her to stay, or called to let you know what happened, so you wouldn't walk into that.  **If they actually invited her,** they need therapy if they cannot understand that **they just broke your relationship with them, and broke all trust you had with them.**   Doesn't matter what their motivation might have been, it was a terrible thing for them to do to you. \n\n**And all that is distracting from the real issue here.**  All their arguments to convince you that this should be blamed on you, it's all distraction from the real issue.
