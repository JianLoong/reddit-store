It wasn't a big family thing, you'd specifically said no, she wasn't being singled out with other cousins going , so what was your parents reasoning? I am really interested in the logic.\n\nAnd they didn't even try to separate you either.\n\n As a parent, anyone who hurts my child isn't getting a seat at the table and you can be sure I'd hold a grudge longer than my child did.\n\n\"Grace texted me saying I could have shown respect to my parents because they waited weeks for those reservations\" - rhe reservations didn't go to waste - they took Nancy for dinner.\n\nEdit to add NTA", "Jesus Lord, my heart breaks reading this. \n\nHow incredibly cruel. I am so sorry that your parents care more about appearances than they do about you. \n\nThis isn\u2019t something that was a petty cousin drama;this is a literal breakdown and trauma", "NTA they should apologize to you for ruining your Birthday", "I know there is a cultural aspect to this but as I told my 87 yr old mom not too long ago, respect is a two-way street in their adopted country and age brings nothing to the table there if everyone is considered an \u201cadult.\u201d They all failed to respect you, your opinion, and your boundaries. And, really, ruined your birthday. \n\nIf I\u2019m understanding this correctly, Nancy was seated between your seat and Grace\u2026soooo you were going to have to sit next to her as well? Nonono. I noticed they didn\u2019t invite your boyfriend either? So the person you can\u2019t stand is more important to them than the person you are partnering with. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI would be avoiding my whole family for a while\n They have no respect for you.", "NTA. \u201cWhat was the point of asking me about inviting my bully to my birthday, if you didn\u2019t have any intentions of honoring my answer if/whenI said no?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd to make this abundantly clear for the future:   You can have me attend things, or her attend things, but you can\u2019t have both.\u201d\n\nAnd OP, you\u2019ve now learned that they are capable of disrespecting you to the extent they\u2019d lie to your face and try to surprise-force you two together, against your will, on your flipping bday.  That means you can\u2019t trust them with your safety, and have to take extra precautions at family events now.  Like don\u2019t ever agree to a scenario, like riding with them to go somewhere instead of taking your own car, where you could get trapped and don\u2019t have a quick and easy exit route available to get out of crap like this.", "What an absolute shit thing for your parents to do. I'm sure you were looking forward to going to that restaurant for your birthday. If they wanted to ambush you with some bullshit regarding your cousin, Nancy, they should've done that on a different day. They are the ones who ruined your birthday. And they should be ashamed of themselves. You are absolutely NTA.

They showed that they don\u2019t respect you or your wishes even on your birthday. Your family has some set of b*lls to tell you to call a truce with your tormentor. It was your birthday and you told them specifically NOT to invite that one person and they did it anyway, I just can\u2019t wrap my head around how your parents care more about their niece than there own daughter.", "NTA\n\nI would certainly be going no contact after a stunt like that.", "NTA\n\nI also wanted to say that you handled that with absolute class.

I have a sneaking suspicion the grandparents were behind this, though, they just showed up with Nancy assuming OP\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t stand up for OP against their own parents. And they were, unfortunately, right about that. So I wouldn\u2019t let the grandparents off the hook, either. Or Nancy, who didn\u2019t have the grace or sense to stay the heck away.

They tried to use social norms to pressure you into accepting her.  Well done for not caving.  Now they are onto the guilt.  Do your grandparents know what Nancy did?  Is it worth letting them know?", "Agreed, they are the AH big time. And OP, please share this post with them so that they can get an outsider perspective of their behavior.", "OPs NTA and I agree with you that the parents and sister are. If my family did that to me I would totally cut them off my life. When they or anyone asked or tried to question me. I would simply reply that my family chose my bully/abuser over me, their own flesh and blood.
