I told him there was nothing to be upset about. My 8yo takes melatonin at 8 and is dead asleep at 8:30pm. You can prod him with a stun gun and this boy will not wake up. My 17yo goes to bed at 10pm. My 17yo is still angry at the thought so I told him to go ask his mom to pay for the difference and I'll get you your own bed. Hell I'll get you your own presidential suite if she pays for it.
