I had to go NC with my alcoholic mom for YEARS. She got arrested more than once for DUI. Once she ran a red at 60 mph and took out a volkswagon a 16 year old kid was driving. Luckily he wasn't hurt too bad, but his car was gone, at the same time she took out a river rock retaining wall (think roundish rocks 8\"-15\" in diameter) AND an electrical grid switch bos (4'x4'x5'). Had to be life-flighted to the hospital. Then the last wreck that put her permanently in a care home she (ironically- not purposefully, she was passed out we think) rear ended a beer truck and her car ended up halfway under his huge steel bumper and her feet were crushed. \n\nBottom line: your mom is DOING THIS TO HERSELF, and she won't change until CONSEQUENCES either make her reevaluate her choices, OR outweigh any toxic benefit she gets from this behavior.

CONVERSATION. then No Contact is NECESSARY FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. You cannot FIX your relationship until SHE FIXES HERSELF, and that means not only a daily commitment to not drink (in whatever form that takes, AA or another program) and medication for her bipolar as well as therapy for tools to assist the bipolar behavioral issues while she's in an active phase, be it manic or depressive.\n\nYOUR OWN HEALTH, mental, emotional and physical COMES FIRST.

You can only care for yourself right now and THAT'S OKAY. \n\nIt is REALLY hard to make that choice to go NC, but for me, I KNEW it was the right choice when I visited her in the hospital, she was completely sober and the snide remarks and petty insults were STIIL coming out of her face hole when she was recovering after almost killing herself and a 16 year old kid who just got his license. It was horrible, I left the hospital and cried in my car for 30 minutes. I only saw her three more times in the next 23 years before she passed away and I don't regret it now, because I would have damaged myself and MY OWN RELATIONSHIPS even more if I had continued to take her abuse. Abuse fucks up your head and you end up messing up OTHER relationships due to how you cope/deny/deal wth the abuse in whatever way you do...we all have our own coping strategies, but more often than not, when we are in one abusive relationship, it AFFECTS ALL the OTHERS, whether you want it to or not.\n\nGo NC, talk to your sisters and try to help each other HEAL from this.

I told my husband several times that under no circumstances would my mother ever be allowed to live with us. I would take my dad in a heartbeat, but never my mother. My mother was only about herself as she got older. She hated being in the sun. Hated it when it rained. Didn't have any interest in gardening. My father had fantastic gardens that could feed half of the block if he chose to. I also love gardening, so obviously enjoyed being outside. Mom spent her time inside. My dad spent most of his time outside in the warmer months. When I would go to visit my parents, she would get mad if I went outside to talk to my dad because he was taking her time, even though we were usually sitting in the living room while she watched tv.   I took her on vacation once because she wanted to go to Door County. I told her before we went that we would have to take my convertible and that the top would be down when the weather was nice. I told her that I was not going to eat fast food, because dining at new restaurants was a large part of the fun of traveling. She didn't complain about the car until we made it to Door County. I think she knew I would have turned around and gone home if she started too soon. As soon as we checked into our motel, she demanded I take her to McDonalds. And that I put the top up because it was too much sun on her face. I told her no to McDonalds, and put on some sunscreen. She refused to have that \"greasy stuff\" on her face, I told her not to complain when she gets burnt. I have an overactive sense of smell. If I can't smell something, the most likely others won't smell it either. Her sense of smell was never even close to mine. Every time she saw any roadkill, she would be \"that smell is going to make me puke\" and you should put the top up so we can close the windows, etc.  Don't even get me started on the motel freak outs. Point I am trying to make with this rambling is that someone doesn't need to be bipolar for you to have a valid reason to not let them live with you when they get older. Person can just be a garden variety narcissist and you can still say no, or just anyone at all. If you want to live alone, live alone. None of it makes you an a$$.
