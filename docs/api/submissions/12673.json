She randomly brought it up during a phone conversation and I told her no. She said she\u2019s changed which I don\u2019t fully believe because one of my sisters (22F) just stopped talking to her because she hasn\u2019t changed. My mom and I have had an extremely rocky relationship since I can remember. We just started talking after not speaking for a year. She\u2019s kicked me out twice for the craziest reasons. 1. Not getting her a Diet Coke from McDonald\u2019s at midnight coming home/ looking at apartments 40 minutes away from her. 2. A prior bf I had and my mom got into an argument. She\u2019s also kicked out my sisters and says it was the best decision she made to not live with us, and I completely agree. My mom is bipolar and before she kicked me out a few years ago I was having heart palpitations because she stressed me out so much. She would get drunk and start fights with everyone and no one. My breaking point was when she got drunk and drove into a building. She had to go to jail and when she came out she told me I didn\u2019t miss her enough and told me how dare I plan my wedding so soon when she had a lot going on. There is a whole lot more like her telling me she hates me, she resents me, etc. I could understand that she hates me to an extent if I was a terrible person but I woke the woman up for work daily and made her coffee in the morning.

Just because she is a parent does not mean you are obligated to be her care provider when she is old. \n\nYou have built your own life and based on what you have said your mother is lucky to even be in it.

She is not, and never should be your responsibility, in any way, ever!", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nAs someone who was raised by a alcoholic mother, you have every right to decline taking care of her.\n\nIt pisses me off when people say you have to take care of your parents when they get old.

I had to go NC with my alcoholic mom for YEARS. She got arrested more than once for DUI. Once she ran a red at 60 mph and took out a volkswagon a 16 year old kid was driving. Luckily he wasn't hurt too bad, but his car was gone, at the same time she took out a river rock retaining wall (think roundish rocks 8\"-15\" in diameter) AND an electrical grid switch bos (4'x4'x5'). Had to be life-flighted to the hospital. Then the last wreck that put her permanently in a care home she (ironically- not purposefully, she was passed out we think) rear ended a beer truck and her car ended up halfway under his huge steel bumper and her feet were crushed. \n\nBottom line: your mom is DOING THIS TO HERSELF, and she won't change until CONSEQUENCES either make her reevaluate her choices, OR outweigh any toxic benefit she gets from this behavior.  I understand there is A LOT of guilt on your part, but sweetie, the ONLY person that can change her is HER. If she is this toxic, and you feel MISERABLE after EVERY. SINGLE. CONVERSATION. then No Contact is NECESSARY FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. You cannot FIX your relationship until SHE FIXES HERSELF, and that means not only a daily commitment to not drink (in whatever form that takes, AA or another program) and medication for her bipolar as well as therapy for tools to assist the bipolar behavioral issues while she's in an active phase, be it manic or depressive.\n\nYOUR OWN HEALTH, mental, emotional and physical COMES FIRST. You are NOT responsible FOR HER ACTIONS OR LACK OF ACTION. You can only care for yourself right now and THAT'S OKAY. \n\nIt is REALLY hard to make that choice to go NC, but for me, I KNEW it was the right choice when I visited her in the hospital, she was completely sober and the snide remarks and petty insults were STIIL coming out of her face hole when she was recovering after almost killing herself and a 16 year old kid who just got his license. It was horrible, I left the hospital and cried in my car for 30 minutes. I only saw her three more times in the next 23 years before she passed away and I don't regret it now, because I would have damaged myself and MY OWN RELATIONSHIPS even more if I had continued to take her abuse. Abuse fucks up your head and you end up messing up OTHER relationships due to how you cope/deny/deal wth the abuse in whatever way you do...we all have our own coping strategies, but more often than not, when we are in one abusive relationship, it AFFECTS ALL the OTHERS, whether you want it to or not.\n\nGo NC, talk to your sisters and try to help each other HEAL from this.
