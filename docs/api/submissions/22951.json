Go ahead and start preparing for your inevitable departure from the house, whether it be next year once you\u2019re 18 or later after you\u2019ve been in college for a few years/graduated college. Get your important documents together and in a place only you have access. Research which bank you would like to have an account with and be ready to open that account on your 18th. Get a part time job so you can be saving up money now in preparation for when you are on your own, although that money will likely be going into a joint account for now. If there is another adult family member you would trust to not touch that money unless it were to be used on you, you might want to discuss with the bank some method of limiting the funds being taken from the account per month unless BOTH you and the joint account holder go into the bank and actually freely sign for the withdrawal. I say this because it sounds like if your parents had unfettered access to those funds and \u201cdear Flora\u201d were to want something, they would have no qualms in taking however much money they wanted to (in essence everything) for her purposes. Research housing options and the costs, and stay on top of that information so that you are ready to be out the door at a moments notice if necessary. Basically, plan for everything to go FUBAR and be ecstatic when things actually go your way. For your birthday next year, plan a party yourself where the people who love and support YOU are invited. Tell your parents (and the family/friends who don\u2019t fall in the support you category) that they are welcome to have a family reunion of sorts on your birthday, but it won\u2019t be a birthday party for you since you are already planning that and only inviting those YOU want in attendance. Let them know that if they try and also insist on it being your \u201cbirthday\u201d party, then their guest of honor WON\u2019T be in attendance as you can\u2019t trust them to not hijack the celebration for any other purpose.
