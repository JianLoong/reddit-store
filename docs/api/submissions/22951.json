I\u2019m the youngest granddaughter/niece/ daughter so it meant a lot to me to see everybody who came. My sister(24f) Flora and i never been close due to our age gap. When she hit her teenage years, she didn\u2019t even want to be seen with me since it was embarrassing to have a younger sister.\n\nFor some context, I was an oopsie baby while Flora wasn\u2019t. She\u2019s always been my parents golden child and it had to be her way or no way. When it came to my birthdays growing up, she\u2019ll find a way to make it about herself. When it was my 14th birthday, Flora faked a panic attack causing my parents to shift their focus on her. I never had a birthday to myself since Flora had to be in the spotlight.\n\nI begged my parents to not invite Flora since i didn\u2019t want to share the spotlight with her. My parents assured me that she\u2019s finally matured and how it was a sister thing. Come the day of the party and Flora comes wearing a big flowy dress  Throughout the party ,Flora didn\u2019t drink any alcohol which was strange since she\u2019s a partier. When it came down to gifts, Flora gave me a box with a t-shirt which said \u201cworlds best aunt\u201d. Everybody was shocked and my mother was excited. I bursted out crying.\n\nFloras grin quickly went away when people noticed my negative reaction. My mom told me to stop being selfish since it\u2019s wonderful that my sister was having a baby and how she\u2019s been trying for awhile. All the rage i\u2019ve felt over the years came out and we ended up having a huge argument. I told Flora how my birthday doesn\u2019t revolve around her and how i wish she wasn\u2019t my sister. Cue more screaming and arguing causing half the guest to leave. Flora ended up leaving and now everybody is extremely upset at me for saying what i said\n\ni dont feel guilty and i\u2019m happy but AITA? my parents are pressuring me to say sorry to keep the peace but i don\u2019t want to", "created_utc": 1690112042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157cjgv/aita_for_telling_my_sister_my_birthday_doesnt/", "score": 385, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is a selfish attention-seeker who deliberately ruined your birthday by announcing her pregnancy. \n\nThat was a very inappropriate and insensitive gift to give you.

She did it on purpose.", "NTA to hell with keeping the peace. Your sister is a spoiled brat and it's your parent's fault. Keep your nose to the grindstone in school.

Flora is the Golden Child.\n\nIt is extremely bad manners to take over another person celebration,  That is exactly what she did what she pregnancy announcement.  She knew what she was doing.\n\nThat are asking you to keep the peace.  you are the younger child and didn't take over Flora's party.  Notice how the ask the person who is younger, has less status to be the better person.
