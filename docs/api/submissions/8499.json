I commute to work in a nearby city every day and she stays at home. We have no children.\n\nMy commute is generally about two hours. I can shorten this by 10-20 minutes with some good timing and luck, but for the most part, it\u2019s a long commute.\n\nNow, what has often been a source of friction in my marriage is that 9 times out of 10, the moment I step in the door, my wife asks me to do something. She always has some miscellaneous chore that absolutely cannot wait. She wants me to take out the trash, make dinner, wash some dishes, or whatever else. I\u2019ve told her time and time again that I need a bit of time to unwind from work and then I\u2019ll happily do it.\n\nLast Thursday, after I asked her for time to relax, she said that I had 2 hours to relax after work. She insisted my commute home was plenty of time to listen to music and unwind. When I explained that driving in traffic was probably more nerve-wracking than work, she said I was just sitting on my butt. \n\nThis Monday, I woke her up with me and said that I had a special surprise for her. She assumed I had taken the day off work and we were going somewhere special. She got dressed and we got in my car. I got to the freeway, where I told her that we were going to spend the next two hours sitting in traffic together, seeing as she considers that leisure.\n\nShe immediately got upset at me for \u201clying\u201d to her. We argued for about 20 minutes until she stopped responding. Then she started watching Netflix on her phone. Then she asked me to drop her off somewhere so she could Uber home. I did not.\n\nWe got to my office building and she immediately jumped out of the car to find something to do. I went to work as usual, but after I finished she was nowhere to be seen and not answering texts. Finally I called her and she picked up the phone to tell me she had taken an Uber home in the afternoon, then hanging up on me.\n\nSince I did this, she hasn\u2019t said more than a word or two to me at a time.

If she is a SAHW then isn\u2019t her job literally to look after your home? Not saying she should do everything but welcoming you home with a to do list doesn\u2019t sound great either. \n\nYou two need to learn to communicate to listen to each other and actually hear what the other one is saying. And maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider this insane commuting arrangement.", "ESH\n\nYou kidnapped her and left her 2 hours from home.  That's horrific.\n\nBut yeh, you need some time to unwind after work and that is 100% reasonable.\n\nYou shouldn't have done it like this, but you absolutely needed to make the point.

Taking out trash should be fine but having to do dinner right away is excessive.", "YTA\n\nI think it's a lesson your wife needed to learn - but boy howdy, you went about it in all the wrong ways, not the least of which being that when she asked you to drop her off somewhere so she could uber home, you REFUSED to let her out.  Wife or not, that's essentially kidnapping (dramatic, I know, but technically true).\n\n(not rating it ESH because the question was about OP's actions - not those of his wife, who yea, is wrong in jumping down his throat the minute he walks in)", "Dude you kidnapped her for two hours and refused to let her out of the car. \n\nWhat do you think?", "I get why you do it. Was it effective? idk. You tried explaining it to her and she was still dismissive. I'm leaning NTA but that was fairly drastic measures.", "YTA. You didnt explain when she got her hopes up.

You two need to sort this out, as this outrageous behavior by your wife has the potential to ruin your marriage.  She is 1000% wrong.  \n\nOn a side note I'm not sure she learned her lesson.  After all, she was able to take an uber home.  A more fitting lesson would have been to make her drive...both ways.  And make sure that she leaves her cell phone at home all day.  It's not safe to use a cell phone in the car anyway.  So she would have driven you to work.  Waited for you all day without her cell phone.  And then driven you home.  And as soon as you two walk in the house, you should have DEMANDED that she cook dinner for you RIGHT DAMN NOW.  And enforce it.  Only then, she might have gotten the message.

I get you need to relax when you come in from work but did you even try to have that conversation with your wife before you pulled a shitty stunt like that? Too right she isn\u2019t talking to you. And how long do you need to \u2018relax\u2019 before you do anything adult? Compromise is key here, if you are asking for 1/2 hour then fine, anything more than that you are taking the piss. \n\nAlso you fail to mention if your wife works from home. If she does then the chores are an equal split, I suggest a rota etc.\n\n You both choose to live where you live, you chose to do a 2hr commute.

I wouldn't dream of asking my fiance to take the trash out, cook or wash dishes that's done by time he gets home. You work in the city so there's alot she could have done to occupy her time while you worked. You explained how the drive was worse than working time and time again so shows your feelings dont matter to her. Also shows she doesn't lnow of a thing called 5 o'clock  traffic which is worse than drive home so even though you didnt tell her the exact plan she still got out easier than she would have on the way home from work. She doesn't have a child to watch all day so what does she do to cant have dishes washed, meal cooked, trash out etc. In my opinion you aren't a husband you are a paycheck. No not the ahole she is for not giving her 100% when you are", "YTA. That's called kidnapping.", "ESH\n\n>She immediately got upset at me for \u201clying\u201d to her.\n\nAt the end of this 2h she was probably more mad that you proved her wrong. Traffic is one of the most stressful things and you're doing 4h of this everyday work day? I would be completely exhausted when I get home in your place.\n\nMy recommendation is that in the short term you and your wife establish a routine for when you get home. For example, you arrive and take a shower and then the two of you talk a little to help you relax and after dinner she talks about what needs to be done. But you also need a schedule of what your chores are, taking out the trash, doing the dishes, doing the laundry, these are things that can have specific days. By having a schedule you already know what you need to do and you also don't wear your wife out by forcing her to treat you like a child to do your part in maintaining the house.\n\nIn the long term do you think that driving 4h a day is sustainable? This is probably rightly stressful and is cutting your time with your wife short. And if having kids is something you want this situation will be more problematic because your wife will need more help but you will be in the same position.\n\nPS: Say sorry to her about lying and for not having prepared a way for her to go back safely. I understand your action and that maybe it was a necessary thing but that dosen't make you right.", "NTA.\n\nYou explained that commuting in traffic is not relaxing for you, and she did not take you seriously.\n\nYou showed her what commuting is like by bringing her along. (To be fair, she got the easy end by getting to sit back and watch Netflix. You should have made her drive.)\n\nShe didn\u2019t like it that you needed to explain somewhat visually something that you had already explained verbally.", "YTA", "NTA.  But it would have been a more effective lesson if she was driving, but then she would have turned around.  I used to commute 2hrs each way to work driving as well, there's nothing relaxing about it.  No offense the things you mention could be done by your wife, you are working/commuting for 12hrs per day while she is at home doing what exactly?", "NTA. If she stays at home without having kids, it's literally her part of contributing to take care of the household. She cannot expect that you, after having worked full-time PLUS commuting for a total of four hours, are immediately doing chores at home. Why doesn't she work? What is she doing the whole day? I am all in with splitting chores if both partners are working or if one is staying home to take care of kids but in this situation there's no reason for you doing more than tasks she is physically not able to do during work week. Your \"surprise\" might have been harsh yet she apparently didn't understand your rightful desire to relax after coming home from work before, so I think it was a good idea.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
