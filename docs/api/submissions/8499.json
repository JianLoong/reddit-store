I commute to work in a nearby city every day and she stays at home. We have no children.\n\nMy commute is generally about two hours. I can shorten this by 10-20 minutes with some good timing and luck, but for the most part, it\u2019s a long commute.\n\nNow, what has often been a source of friction in my marriage is that 9 times out of 10, the moment I step in the door, my wife asks me to do something. She always has some miscellaneous chore that absolutely cannot wait. She wants me to take out the trash, make dinner, wash some dishes, or whatever else. I\u2019ve told her time and time again that I need a bit of time to unwind from work and then I\u2019ll happily do it.\n\nLast Thursday, after I asked her for time to relax, she said that I had 2 hours to relax after work. She insisted my commute home was plenty of time to listen to music and unwind. When I explained that driving in traffic was probably more nerve-wracking than work, she said I was just sitting on my butt. \n\nThis Monday, I woke her up with me and said that I had a special surprise for her. She assumed I had taken the day off work and we were going somewhere special. She got dressed and we got in my car. I got to the freeway, where I told her that we were going to spend the next two hours sitting in traffic together, seeing as she considers that leisure.\n\nShe immediately got upset at me for \u201clying\u201d to her. We argued for about 20 minutes until she stopped responding. Then she started watching Netflix on her phone. Then she asked me to drop her off somewhere so she could Uber home. I did not.\n\nWe got to my office building and she immediately jumped out of the car to find something to do. I went to work as usual, but after I finished she was nowhere to be seen and not answering texts. Finally I called her and she picked up the phone to tell me she had taken an Uber home in the afternoon, then hanging up on me.\n\nSince I did this, she hasn\u2019t said more than a word or two to me at a time. She seems to be really upset, but did I take this too far?", "created_utc": 1674889607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10n8vg5/aita_for_deceiving_my_wife_into_joining_me_for_my/", "score": 449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Essentially you would have left her stranded without her even knowing 2 hours from home. For what exactly?! Because your plan clearly backfired spectacularly.\n\nYour wife also is in the wrong for not seeing that you work the whole days + you spend 4 hours commuting. She is at home all day. If she is a SAHW then isn\u2019t her job literally to look after your home? Not saying she should do everything but welcoming you home with a to do list doesn\u2019t sound great either. \n\nYou two need to learn to communicate to listen to each other and actually hear what the other one is saying. And maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider this insane commuting arrangement.", "ESH\n\nYou kidnapped her and left her 2 hours from home.  That's horrific.\n\nBut yeh, you need some time to unwind after work and that is 100% reasonable.\n\nYou shouldn't have done it like this, but you absolutely needed to make the point.  Also, she can take out the trash.  You're gone twelve or thirteen damned hours.\n\nEDIT: She's unemployed, no kids.  Why isn't she making dinner or doing the dishes?", "Esh; you were unreasonable to do that to her when all it\u2019s going to achieve is to escalate your arguments and piss her off even more. She\u2019s unreasonable to be giving you any jobs assuming she doesn\u2019t work. Sounds like you need to communicate better with each other though", "INFO: does she work from home?", "ESH \n\nTough one OP and I can see why you felt it was necessary.

So does she work from home or what is she doing all day that she can't do the chores herself?\n\nEven so, what did you expected when you basically lied to her and more so refused to let her leave the car, did you think she was gonna wait in the car till you were done with your work after that? What even made you think this was the best way to solve this\n\nYou really should have a talk about what you expect from each other in this relationship. Taking out trash should be fine but having to do dinner right away is excessive.", "YTA\n\nI think it's a lesson your wife needed to learn - but boy howdy, you went about it in all the wrong ways, not the least of which being that when she asked you to drop her off somewhere so she could uber home, you REFUSED to let her out.  Wife or not, that's essentially kidnapping (dramatic, I know, but technically true).\n\n(not rating it ESH because the question was about OP's actions - not those of his wife, who yea, is wrong in jumping down his throat the minute he walks in)", "Dude you kidnapped her for two hours and refused to let her out of the car. \n\nWhat do you think?", "I get why you do it. Was it effective? idk. You tried explaining it to her and she was still dismissive. I'm leaning NTA but that was fairly drastic measures.", "YTA. You didnt explain when she got her hopes up.

You two need to sort this out, as this outrageous behavior by your wife has the potential to ruin your marriage.  She is 1000% wrong.  \n\nOn a side note I'm not sure she learned her lesson.  After all, she was able to take an uber home.  A more fitting lesson would have been to make her drive...both ways.  And make sure that she leaves her cell phone at home all day.  It's not safe to use a cell phone in the car anyway.  So she would have driven you to work.  Waited for you all day without her cell phone.  And then driven you home.  And as soon as you two walk in the house, you should have DEMANDED that she cook dinner for you RIGHT DAMN NOW.  And enforce it.  Only then, she might have gotten the message.

I get you need to relax when you come in from work but did you even try to have that conversation with your wife before you pulled a shitty stunt like that? Too right she isn\u2019t talking to you. And how long do you need to \u2018relax\u2019 before you do anything adult? Compromise is key here, if you are asking for 1/2 hour then fine, anything more than that you are taking the piss. \n\nAlso you fail to mention if your wife works from home. If she does then the chores are an equal split, I suggest a rota etc.\n\n You both choose to live where you live, you chose to do a 2hr commute. If it doesn\u2019t work for the family then something needs to change.", "NTA: I am a SAH mom of 5. I wouldn't dream of asking my fiance to take the trash out, cook or wash dishes that's done by time he gets home. You work in the city so there's alot she could have done to occupy her time while you worked. You explained how the drive was worse than working time and time again so shows your feelings dont matter to her. Also shows she doesn't lnow of a thing called 5 o'clock  traffic which is worse than drive home so even though you didnt tell her the exact plan she still got out easier than she would have on the way home from work. She doesn't have a child to watch all day so what does she do to cant have dishes washed, meal cooked, trash out etc. In my opinion you aren't a husband you are a paycheck. No not the ahole she is for not giving her 100% when you are", "YTA. That's called kidnapping.", "ESH\n\n>She immediately got upset at me for \u201clying\u201d to her.\n\nAt the end of this 2h she was probably more mad that you proved her wrong. Traffic is one of the most stressful things and you're doing 4h of this everyday work day? I would be completely exhausted when I get home in your place.\n\nMy recommendation is that in the short term you and your wife establish a routine for when you get home. For example, you arrive and take a shower and then the two of you talk a little to help you relax and after dinner she talks about what needs to be done. But you also need a schedule of what your chores are, taking out the trash, doing the dishes, doing the laundry, these are things that can have specific days. By having a schedule you already know what you need to do and you also don't wear your wife out by forcing her to treat you like a child to do your part in maintaining the house.\n\nIn the long term do you think that driving 4h a day is sustainable? This is probably rightly stressful and is cutting your time with your wife short. And if having kids is something you want this situation will be more problematic because your wife will need more help but you will be in the same position.\n\nPS: Say sorry to her about lying and for not having prepared a way for her to go back safely. I understand your action and that maybe it was a necessary thing but that dosen't make you right.", "NTA.\n\nYou explained that commuting in traffic is not relaxing for you, and she did not take you seriously.\n\nYou showed her what commuting is like by bringing her along. (To be fair, she got the easy end by getting to sit back and watch Netflix. You should have made her drive.)\n\nShe didn\u2019t like it that you needed to explain somewhat visually something that you had already explained verbally.", "YTA", "NTA.  But it would have been a more effective lesson if she was driving, but then she would have turned around.  I used to commute 2hrs each way to work driving as well, there's nothing relaxing about it.  No offense the things you mention could be done by your wife, you are working/commuting for 12hrs per day while she is at home doing what exactly?", "NTA. If she stays at home without having kids, it's literally her part of contributing to take care of the household. She cannot expect that you, after having worked full-time PLUS commuting for a total of four hours, are immediately doing chores at home. Why doesn't she work? What is she doing the whole day? I am all in with splitting chores if both partners are working or if one is staying home to take care of kids but in this situation there's no reason for you doing more than tasks she is physically not able to do during work week. Your \"surprise\" might have been harsh yet she apparently didn't understand your rightful desire to relax after coming home from work before, so I think it was a good idea.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That being said, OP seems ok with the arrangement for some reason.", "What do you imagine she does all day, every day, that compares to a full day's work + 2 hour commute one way.", "Letting someone breathe a little bit isn\u2019t a problem. \n\nI work from home now, but in a previous job, my commute was 3 hours one way and most of that on a congested highway system with a lot of accidents. Sometimes, especially if it was raining, I would wait at my job or nearby for an hour or two because waiting until the congestion thinned meant less time driving - there were times in bad weather that that one way drive was 5 hours. Yes, I got very little sleep with that job. \n\nJust sitting for even 10 minutes when I got home was very necessary.", ">\"Hey, I've taken care of the house all day.\"\n\nOh yes, because we all know houses need 8 hours of care each and every day to be clean /s\n\nGet real. OP's wife needed to learn a lesson and it's clear whenever he has tried to communicate this in the past that she has completely ignored him, not doubt because she knows better.", "How messy could the house possibly get when she\u2019s the only person there for the majority of the day? She doesn\u2019t have real responsibilities and she\u2019s taking advantage of her husband.", "It\u2019s not even a stereotype. Unless they live on a farm and she\u2019s choring all day or they have a giant mansion but ran out of money for a maid, she\u2019s not spending more than a couple hours a day \u201ctaking care of the house\u201d this is an insane post all around", ">Hello, police? I'm driving in a car with my husband and he won't let me out in the middle of the freeway. Well yes I got in the car on my own. No, he's not threatening me. Well you see I'm already data capped and I want to go home so I can watch more Netflix but he won't turn around. I thought I was going to a spa but he's driving to work with me in the car! Hello? Police?", "Kidnapping is the \"unlawful taking and carrying away of a person by force or fraud or the unlawful seizure and detention of a person against his will.\"\n\nOP got the wife into his car under false pretenses, hence fraudulently carried her away. He then detained her against her will, by refusing to let her out when she asked to be. \n\nIt is literally kidnapping.\n\nAnd as per the \"Well she should have called for help/police\", you going to argue that any kidnap victim, when next to their captor, should call for help? When they are right there to possibly hurt them if they do so?\n\nOP is absolutely in the wrong for literally kidnapping his wife. And I am very concerned by how many people seem to think that doing criminal acts is fine, as long as it's against one's spouse.", "Ok, so you just think that illegal actions, if done to one's spouse, are less severe than if done to a stranger?", "Two wrongs do not make a right. The correct response to a relationship being dysfunctional is to either work to improve that relationship, or end it. Not kidnap somebody.", "How exactly does one exit a moving car on a freeway when one is not in control of the vehicle?", "\"She was allowed out\"\n\nWow...nice phrasing.\n\nNot sure if you know this, but there are plenty of exits along the freeway he could have stopped off at to let her out. He refused. Just because you eventually let someone go doesn't mean you never held them hostage.", "No, she asked him to find a place to drop her off and he \"did not.\" So he refused to stop and let her out. There were probably multiple chances to drop her off if he took them. You don't go two hours driving without seeing at least one gas station, and the amount of traffic indicates there was something everyone was going to, and I doubt it was all employees where OP works.\n\nThe word kidnapped conjures images of dragging someone by force or drugging, but he tricked her into his vehicle to take her two hours from home and refused to let her leave when she wanted. That's illegal. I'm not sure if he'd be charged with kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, or something else because it really depends on where you are, but yeah it's not ok. I can see why OP felt tempted to do that, but if that were literally anyone he wasn't dating not only would cops have been called but nobody would be denying he's an AH for doing it.\n\nOP I can tell you were desperate, but you should have told her you wanted her to see what your \"relaxing\" drive was like instead of luring her into the vehicle and refusing to let her out. That's a serious red flag because you literally took away her control over her own body to make a point. What she was doing was unreasonable, but you were out of line and should apologize for the deception at the very least.", "Yeah, thats still kidnapping\u2026.i can see it now. A kidnappers defense in court. \u201cYour honor.  Imdid kidnap her, but i couldnt set her out of the sidemof the road, that would be dangerous. So i really only kidnapped her for the five minutes it took to get her into my car, not the four hour drive to my lair in the mountains, where the police were waiting for me\u2026.\u201d\n\nYTMA \u2026.major", "That\u2019s\u2026. Not the same thing at all lol", "The difference here is that parents legally have control of their children's locations and activities. He has no right to keep his wife somewhere she doesn't want to be, that's unlawful detainment, and since he was *taking* her somewhere she didn't want to be, it's kidnapping.", "Lmao this doesn\u2019t even apply \ud83e\udd23 idk what you\u2019re smoking there\u2019s been many situations on this subreddit where grandparents have just up and took the kids without permission I also hate to tell you but most kidnappings are done by people close to the family cannot tell you how many amber alerts are about another parent taking the kid over a custody battle or a  close member of the family just up and taking the kid it happens way more then you think", "Hello police, I feel threatened as I\u2019ve been tricked and kidnapped by my husband. He refuses to let me leave his vehicle. I do not feel safe. I\u2019m not trying to be confrontational I just want to be let out of the car. He could be going to work but he\u2019s already lied about where we are going and I\u2019m scared.", "there are plenty of exits that he could have gotten off on to drop her off at. he told her that she wasn\u2019t to get out of the car and that she wasn\u2019t allowed to home. that\u2019s literally the definition of kidnapping, it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s her husband or not, let\u2019s look at Chris Watts who killed his entire family and shoved them into oil containers. your logic of him being her husband doesn\u2019t make this any less of a shitty situation he put his wife in.\n\nedit: typo", "I honestly can't tell if these are serious or not. Mods can't either, if they deleted the other one.", "She had a phone. Call the cops.", "By your argument her forcing him to exit the freeway, an action he didn't wish to take and a location he didn't wish to go would be kidnapping.", "I don't think kidnapping would stick. False imprisonment though? Yep that definitely applies", "This would get laughed out of any courtroom in the world. \u201cMy husband tricked me into the car to watch Netflix for 2 hours over a dumb argument.\u201d", "Just like I can see her plea to the cops.\n\n>You guys aren't taking me seriously. I thought we were going to the spa or to a movie but ... but he took me to his workplace! And he wouldn't get off the freeway to let me out when I wanted! It's true that he never threatened me and I was never in danger, but oh you don't even know how hard it is to watch Netflix while roaming.", "Yeah not sure what this dude is on about. Holding someone in a vehicle against their will after lying to get them in there is kidnapping. \n\nI guess he's trying to use a far-out situation that would technically fit that definition to mock the definition of someone being kidnapped? But nobody would call the situation he described kidnapping unless the adult wasn't supposed to have the child.", "My situation is closer to OP's situation than yours. Where did you even get \"grandparents taking the child\" from? \n\nOP lied to his wife to get her in the car. Treating this like a kidnapping makes you a huge drama queen.", "Which is exactly what OP asked for and he is denied because the wife thinks his commute is enough time to decompress and somehow she can't take the trash to the curb after being home all day.", "Or, maybe the wife isn't the one calling the police either. If she had started screaming \"help\" / \"let me out\" in the car that would have probably been alarming enough to other commuters that they would have called the police. OP is damn lucky his wife didn't freak out like that.", "Why would she call the cops if no crime was taking place /s", "u/AccordLands, what you\u2019ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this thread is now dumber for having seen it. I award you no upvotes, and may God have mercy on your soul.", "You leave me utterly dumbfounded. I literally do not know how to respond to your asinine comment, so all I will say is this.", "Lied to his wife to get her in the car and then refused to let her out. \n\nThat's the opposite of having consent. Yeah she's the AH for the first part of the story but he did this and took her TWO HOURS FROM HOME and left her to Uber back??? That's insanity. Like, if I found out one of my friends did this to their partner I would get that person away from them ASAP. \n\nSorry but the fact is he held her in a vehicle against her will and took her somewhere far away from home and left her with no choice other than sitting in a car with a complete stranger for two hours to get back.", "Lmao if you paid attention I was just giving an example you\u2019re literally just mad because I\u2019m making sense taking anyone without their consent for two hours in a car where she couldn\u2019t get out and begged to be let out would fall under kidnapping she was held against her will it\u2019s not hard to comprehend I feel like this is hitting a nerve with people that would do this exact thing to someone else it\u2019s not hard to have a convo with your partner about chores and how tough a commute from work is he could have even told her like hey why don\u2019t you come with me just so you can\u2019t truly see how it is not oh I\u2019m going to lie to you and not let you out the car for two hours I really think you need to look at some of these comments for the true definition of what kidnapping is", "The women on this subreddit are so entitled, I swear. The man spends 4 hours in a commute in addition to an entire day's work, and they think the wife shouldn't be doing all the chores.", "People who are kidnapped generally do use their phone to watch netflix instead of calling for help. It's just human nature in response to a crime /s", "You gave an example that had zero relevance to the situation. I gave an example that was far more similar, and then you got mad at me for doing it.\n\nIt's hilarious how you pulled something so irrelevant out of your ass and then whined that I didn't just agree with your point. Now you're squirming and insisting that it's kidnapping because sometimes grandparents pick their grandchildren up unannounced. \n\nTry a little harder to stay on topic. At least don't start crying when people aren't willing to go with you on your wild ADHD tangents.\n\nEdit: bruh he responded and then blocked me \ud83e\udd23", "To be clear, I don't think kidnap is the right term. I personally like the poster who said it's not not kidnapping.  This comment thread is lols.  But just as people saying kidnapping are maybe taking it far, calling the cops on your partner in this situation is an overreaction.  Someone sitting on their phone watching netflix aren't in enough distress to need the cops.  Let's all take a deep breath and chill.", "Lmao I\u2019m actually not mad at all \ud83e\udd23 I didn\u2019t pull anything out my ass I gave examples on different forms of kidnapping which it seems you didn\u2019t appreciate too much so it tells me I hit a nerve which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in stating that this is something you\u2019d do lol but nice try I\u2019m not going to sit here and argue with you all day long so have fun I will be blocking you"]}
