His behavior is way suspect. \n\n1) See how his story changes (twice!!!) when you don't believe the first one?  Why lie at first if you don't feel caught, and don't have something to hide?  Why not come out with the \"oh, I was just curious what they look like\" line first?\n\n2) Him challenging you to find cameras is a deflection.  It doesn't prove anything. Of course he doesn't have them if they haven't arrived yet.\n\n3) His text to the friend sounds like he was putting words into her mouth so she would know what to say.  If he wanted to allay your fears, he should have given you the phone to have a private conversation with her, so that you could see if her story matched his story.  Let it be open ended.  \"tell me everything about every time you and he discussed hidden cameras, starting with who brought it up and why.\"\n\n4) His indignation that he can't believe you would think he would buy an item he searched on.  Really?  \n\nI can't say for sure that this is what is going on, but I don't trust him.", "NTA, and the text he sent to his friend could actually be translated to \"I got caught, please help me fool my girlfriend and agree to everything I'll say\".", "NTA that text was super specific and basically spoon fed the info to them to confirm.

I\u2019d say you might be overreacting if it just went from there.\n\nBut he lied about why it was popping up, knew you were right, course-corrected with the friend/hotel story, and then spoon-fed that story to his friend to get them to help him out without it being too obvious that they\u2019re both lying to you. \n\nEven if he wasn\u2019t buying or using the cameras, the way he fully lied at the beginning and then ran in circles to give you a half-ass explanation is enough to make him the AH.

You've only been together for a little bit of time so of course you see something like that and anyone would get suspect of what's going on.

Not telling her about the (alleged) crazy event that happened in his friend's life right after he (allegedly) found out about it didn't help. Not telling her to be careful about potential spy cameras, because there are creeps out there, didn't help.  Why wouldn't it be on his mind for her to protect herself if this happened to his friend?  All of this points in a different direction than what he wants.  Nothing he could do about it though.  It isn't like he could know in advance that she would find the search.\n\nIt helps to acknowledge what the person is experiencing, and let the other person take the lead.: \"I understand why your mind went there but that isn't the case.  What would it take to convince you that what you are saying isn't what happened?\" And then if their requests are reasonable, agree to them.  If not, don't - and accept that the relationship might be over if that is the case.  \n\nThe problem is there are times when some bad stuff happened, and there are times when some bad stuff only looks like it happened.  So how things are said, word choices, intonations, pauses, gestures and other non-verbal cues come into play.  Sometimes you know something is off, but can't express it.  Eye contact is huge.  People that aren't guilty make eye contact a whole lot better than those that are.  \n\nUltimately it might come down to the accused accepting that despite it being untrue, there is nothing more for them to do, and saying point blank: \"I don't know what else to tell you.  What you are believing isn't the truth, and I have no other ways to prove it to you.  I'm sorry you feel that way and I am sorry that I can't do anything more to help you see this isn't what happened.  I hope you figure out what you/we need to be able to move past this event.

If he had an innocent explanation he would have immediately led with that. I don't use AliExpress but I assume they have a purchase history. I'd hope she checked that but even if I still wouldn't believe him. Even if he didn't buy it yet he's apparently looking into it.", "Also looking at different things and buying it is different. I love all sort of gadgets that I have no plan of buying. Night vision goggles (they are cool but realistically I would NEVER have opportunities to use it), any gadgets really. I do think it is weird to be defensive but sure", "Except he didn\u2019t fess up to that, he first tried to gaslight, then lie. If it was innocent he would\u2019ve said, yeah I did, and it\u2019s here, be he didn\u2019t.", "He still lied twice before going to that story.", "Oh yeah, he's clearly hiding something from OP to the point where she should examine every object (especially any gifts from him) and have a look behind any removable plates like light switches, vents, and outlets in her room and bathroom (and the rest of the place, in case he placed a camera to see who was coming and going rather than trying to get wank material). And she should dump him, in case this situation made him realize that he should consider what to say in the event that someone asks him directly about his secret activities or have a friend ready to cover for him in advance.\n\nThough I'm hoping that his texts to his friend set off as many alarm bells for her as they did for OP. Considering how bad he was at covering it up, it wouldn't surprise me if he mistakenly believed that his friend would have his back and ended up burning down a bunch more bridges (when she tells others in their circle) in his attempt to put out the fire on the one between him and OP.", "Holy hell. I just went through and read what happened. I also saw where you tried seeking advice on r/Journalism. I know it's been 3 years, but I am a working journalist and wanted to let you know that you absolutely were in the right about all of it. The moment you said the reporter was not allowed, that should have been the end of it. They needed to leave. Their actions were in no way, shape, or form ethical. I am glad you got this taken down, and I am so, so sorry this happened to you."]}
