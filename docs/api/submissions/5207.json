His behavior is way suspect. \n\n1) See how his story changes (twice!!!) when you don't believe the first one?  Why lie at first if you don't feel caught, and don't have something to hide?  Why not come out with the \"oh, I was just curious what they look like\" line first?\n\n2) Him challenging you to find cameras is a deflection.  It doesn't prove anything. Of course he doesn't have them if they haven't arrived yet.\n\n3) His text to the friend sounds like he was putting words into her mouth so she would know what to say.  If he wanted to allay your fears, he should have given you the phone to have a private conversation with her, so that you could see if her story matched his story.  Let it be open ended.  \"tell me everything about every time you and he discussed hidden cameras, starting with who brought it up and why.\"\n\n4) His indignation that he can't believe you would think he would buy an item he searched on.  Really?  \n\nI can't say for sure that this is what is going on, but I don't trust him.", "NTA, and the text he sent to his friend could actually be translated to \"I got caught, please help me fool my girlfriend and agree to everything I'll say\".", "NTA that text was super specific and basically spoon fed the info to them to confirm.

Example: \nYou: \u201cWhy are those cameras in your search history?\u201d \n\nHim, with NO hesitation: \u201cOh my friend and I thought there was one in this hotel and we were curious, wanted to see what they looked like, etc.\u201d \n\nCompletely transparent, right from the start. I\u2019d say you might be overreacting if it just went from there.\n\nBut he lied about why it was popping up, knew you were right, course-corrected with the friend/hotel story, and then spoon-fed that story to his friend to get them to help him out without it being too obvious that they\u2019re both lying to you. \n\nEven if he wasn\u2019t buying or using the cameras, the way he fully lied at the beginning and then ran in circles to give you a half-ass explanation is enough to make him the AH.

You've only been together for a little bit of time so of course you see something like that and anyone would get suspect of what's going on.

If he wasn't up to something he would have just admitted it straight away.", "NTA it was already sounding sketchy but the wording of the text confirmed it.

Got it.  This is a good question.  In this situation it wasn't just the google search, it was the google search plus the 2 fake stories.  I will still answer what you asked.\n\nI can't give a one size fits all approach, but from my experience of misunderstandings, being defensive doesn't help.  Acting shocked that she could consider the idea he was going to spy doesn't help, because it sends the message that you think she is delusional. Not telling her about the (alleged) crazy event that happened in his friend's life right after he (allegedly) found out about it didn't help. Not telling her to be careful about potential spy cameras, because there are creeps out there, didn't help.  Why wouldn't it be on his mind for her to protect herself if this happened to his friend?  All of this points in a different direction than what he wants.  Nothing he could do about it though.  It isn't like he could know in advance that she would find the search.\n\nIt helps to acknowledge what the person is experiencing, and let the other person take the lead.: \"I understand why your mind went there but that isn't the case.  What would it take to convince you that what you are saying isn't what happened?\" And then if their requests are reasonable, agree to them.  If not, don't - and accept that the relationship might be over if that is the case.  \n\nThe problem is there are times when some bad stuff happened, and there are times when some bad stuff only looks like it happened.  So how things are said, word choices, intonations, pauses, gestures and other non-verbal cues come into play.  Sometimes you know something is off, but can't express it.  Eye contact is huge.  People that aren't guilty make eye contact a whole lot better than those that are.  \n\nUltimately it might come down to the accused accepting that despite it being untrue, there is nothing more for them to do, and saying point blank: \"I don't know what else to tell you.  What you are believing isn't the truth, and I have no other ways to prove it to you.  I'm sorry you feel that way and I am sorry that I can't do anything more to help you see this isn't what happened.  I hope you figure out what you/we need to be able to move past this event.
