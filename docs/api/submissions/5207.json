He is kind, caring and funny. A little eccentric but nothing about him has ever seemed \"off\".\nThe other day, we were talking about something we wanted to buy together, so he opened up his phone to the AliExpress app and when he clicked the search bar I saw the search history had multiple variations of \"Hidden spy camera\" \"secret camera\" \"WiFi camera\". \nWhen I saw this I wanted to double check, so I took his phone and typed the first few letters into the search bar and sure enough the variations dropped down from the search bar in bold. At first he pretended to not know what I was talking about. Then he said \"it came up as a suggestion because you typed the first few letters in.\" \nI was calm but kept telling him no, that's not true.\nThen he told me him and his friend had been talking about how she recently stayed at a hotel where she suspected there was hidden cameras, so they decided to research them together to see what they look like. \n\nThis also sounded like bullshit to me, and at this point I was kind of freaking out. \nI've never seen him so annoyed before but he was in disbelief that I thought he'd really be the kind of person to buy hidden cameras.\nHe said \"Ok then, I will call my friend right now and she will tell you it's true\" and I stayed silent, then he said \"search my whole room, there's no cameras\" \nThen he texted his friend to prove to me the conversation they had was real. The texts said something like \"hey remember when we were researching spy cams together, well my partner saw and they think I have hidden cameras. Can you reply so I can prove we talked about them together and that I don't have any cameras\" he said he feels embarrassed he had to send a text like that to his friend.\n\nI feel like him texting his friend kind of proves his story, because otherwise he'd be outing himself as a total creep to her too, and I feel bad for jumping to a conclusion and accusing him. \nIt's been a few days and I think I believe him, but things are still kind of tense between us, I don't think he forgives me.\n\nAITA for jumping to that conclusion or is it a rational reaction?", "created_utc": 1671546646, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqq0ak/aita_for_getting_mad_when_i_saw_hidden_spy_camera/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was giving his friend as much information as possible to get out of trouble. You are not being irrational. It\u2019s dodgy AF.", "NTA. His text was telling his friend what to say.", "NTA.  His behavior is way suspect. \n\n1) See how his story changes (twice!!!) when you don't believe the first one?  Why lie at first if you don't feel caught, and don't have something to hide?  Why not come out with the \"oh, I was just curious what they look like\" line first?\n\n2) Him challenging you to find cameras is a deflection.  It doesn't prove anything. Of course he doesn't have them if they haven't arrived yet.\n\n3) His text to the friend sounds like he was putting words into her mouth so she would know what to say.  If he wanted to allay your fears, he should have given you the phone to have a private conversation with her, so that you could see if her story matched his story.  Let it be open ended.  \"tell me everything about every time you and he discussed hidden cameras, starting with who brought it up and why.\"\n\n4) His indignation that he can't believe you would think he would buy an item he searched on.  Really?  \n\nI can't say for sure that this is what is going on, but I don't trust him.", "NTA, and the text he sent to his friend could actually be translated to \"I got caught, please help me fool my girlfriend and agree to everything I'll say\".", "NTA that text was super specific and basically spoon fed the info to them to confirm. Plus the backing up about the truth would raise suspicion as well. His story still is fishy imo.", "NTA. \n\nIf his friend/hotel story was true, he should\u2019ve told you that right away. Example: \nYou: \u201cWhy are those cameras in your search history?\u201d \n\nHim, with NO hesitation: \u201cOh my friend and I thought there was one in this hotel and we were curious, wanted to see what they looked like, etc.\u201d \n\nCompletely transparent, right from the start. I\u2019d say you might be overreacting if it just went from there.\n\nBut he lied about why it was popping up, knew you were right, course-corrected with the friend/hotel story, and then spoon-fed that story to his friend to get them to help him out without it being too obvious that they\u2019re both lying to you. \n\nEven if he wasn\u2019t buying or using the cameras, the way he fully lied at the beginning and then ran in circles to give you a half-ass explanation is enough to make him the AH. Again, NTA, but I\u2019d be reconsidering a lot of things if I were you.", "NTA\n\nHim trying to lie about it is a huge red flag. He's 100% trying to get his friend to cover for him. Literally for your own safety I would consider breaking up.", "Why would he search what hidden camera looks like in a commercial site and not a search engine, also why wasn't that his first answer and not the third?\nAlso \"my friend stayed at a hotel and she think there was hidden camera there\" is the kind of story you share with your girlfriend unprompted.\nNTA this sounds super fishy", "NTA. What looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck is often a duck. Don't ignore your gut. Marinara flags all over the place here.", "Nta. His text was to tell his friend how to lie. He's a pervert and a liar and you should not date a pervert liar unless you want to be perved on and lied to.", "NTA. It's kinda weird searching for Spy Cameras, your reaction was normal. Besides, at first he made up an excuse with the search bar.", "NTA \n\nnope nope nope. he should\u2019ve texted his friend \u201chey remember our convo about hidden cameras?\u201d The text he sent gave his friend an entire cover story to use and goaded his friend into easily being able to simply type back \u201cyes.\u201d this is very icky and i recommend checking EVERYWHERE in your house/room.", "NTA. Why did he lie at first, instead of telling you right away about his friend and the hotel? \nAnswer: BECAUSE HES LYING. \nTrust your gut and run. You seriously dodged a huge bullet here.", "NTA.  You've only been together for a little bit of time so of course you see something like that and anyone would get suspect of what's going on.  You're in the learning about each other phase and now with today's technology it's easy to get a hold of things like tracking devices and cameras that are so small you wouldn't even notice them unless you're looking for them. (I'll admit I have not looked any up, but you see them all the time in videos now). Heck there's even tracking apps people can install on other peoples phones.    I cannot say one way or the other about if he was getting cameras for your place or his or if he's getting any at all, but what I find weird is he didn't just come out and say why he looked them up in the first place if it wasn't a big deal.", "INFO: Why are you staying with someone you don't trust?", "Please don\u2019t be this naive. You should\u2019ve left the first time his story changed.", "NTA. If you had asked him about it and he'd have said \"it's a security thing\" like a camera for the front door or something, then I'd understand, but the way he replied and tried to pass it off/cover it up was very suspicious. He's made it pretty clear that he's lying.", "NTA. If he wasn't up to something he would have just admitted it straight away.", "NTA it was already sounding sketchy but the wording of the text confirmed it. Had he asked it in a neutral way then MAYBE but nope! An innocent person wouldn't need to be that specific.", "NTA. People are not to be trusted when they don't get to the point in this type of situation. For all you know he could be a total creep and that's the first sign you saw. Be careful of him.", "NTA he's gaslighting you.  Run very fast and very far.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know that if someone pulled up my search history, I would certainly have a few things to feel awkward about and pretend that I had no clue about. Sometimes people are just curious and it doesn't mean anything. If you trust him, you trust him. If you have reason not to trust him, then don't. You said that he searched it on AliExpress. I presume you then would have checked his orders and didn't see any order of a spy cam. I guess he didn't.  \nYou have to decide either to trust him or not trust him.
