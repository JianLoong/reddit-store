His behavior is way suspect. \n\n1) See how his story changes (twice!!!) when you don't believe the first one?  Why lie at first if you don't feel caught, and don't have something to hide?  Why not come out with the \"oh, I was just curious what they look like\" line first?\n\n2) Him challenging you to find cameras is a deflection.  It doesn't prove anything. Of course he doesn't have them if they haven't arrived yet.\n\n3) His text to the friend sounds like he was putting words into her mouth so she would know what to say.  If he wanted to allay your fears, he should have given you the phone to have a private conversation with her, so that you could see if her story matched his story.  Let it be open ended.  \"tell me everything about every time you and he discussed hidden cameras, starting with who brought it up and why.\"\n\n4) His indignation that he can't believe you would think he would buy an item he searched on.  Really?  \n\nI can't say for sure that this is what is going on, but I don't trust him.", "NTA, and the text he sent to his friend could actually be translated to \"I got caught, please help me fool my girlfriend and agree to everything I'll say\".", "NTA that text was super specific and basically spoon fed the info to them to confirm.

Example: \nYou: \u201cWhy are those cameras in your search history?\u201d \n\nHim, with NO hesitation: \u201cOh my friend and I thought there was one in this hotel and we were curious, wanted to see what they looked like, etc.\u201d \n\nCompletely transparent, right from the start. I\u2019d say you might be overreacting if it just went from there.\n\nBut he lied about why it was popping up, knew you were right, course-corrected with the friend/hotel story, and then spoon-fed that story to his friend to get them to help him out without it being too obvious that they\u2019re both lying to you. \n\nEven if he wasn\u2019t buying or using the cameras, the way he fully lied at the beginning and then ran in circles to give you a half-ass explanation is enough to make him the AH.

You've only been together for a little bit of time so of course you see something like that and anyone would get suspect of what's going on.

If he wasn't up to something he would have just admitted it straight away.", "NTA it was already sounding sketchy but the wording of the text confirmed it.

In his text to his friend, he told the friend exactly what to say! I'm not saying he has cameras in his bedroom, bathroom etc, but he WAS searching for them. I wouldn't buy anything he says about this from now on and it gives me icky feelings.", "The fact he changed his story proves he's lying to you, not to mention he was definitely telling his friend to back him up. \n\nNTA, run!", "If the friend story was true he would have started with that. \nThat's a perfectly good reason to he looking maybe not on aliexpress but whatever.\n\nI can think of a few good reasons in a second to want one that isnt to be a perv, but first he denied it then later gave a reason and lead the friend into the story. \nThis makes me think he panicked and was caught in his lie in his head. \n\nNta", "NTA\u2026You can search for all devices on a network via an app on your phone. My guess is that he will have removed any cameras by now though.", "Idk I saw a bunch of videos for finding hidden cams in hotels. I also looked up cams and all that fun stuff. I'm not saying that's his case but seeing as this happened to me I can believe it.", "NTA - along with checking your room and bathroom you, I would either fully check his bedroom or bathroom but more likely just never go in there again \u2026 always trust your gut, his changing story shows he was lying and betraying your trust.", "INFO why do you consider him eccentric?", "You can see all the devices logged to the wifi and I would suggest you do it", "No, you are not. If I seen \u201chidden spy camera\u201d in anyone living in my house\u2019s search history, I would get pissed too.", "NTA\n\n>Then he told me him and his friend had been talking about how she recently stayed at a hotel where she suspected there was hidden cameras, so they decided to research them together to see what they look like.\n\nIf this was true then he would have told you immediately when you first asked. His text to his friend pretty much told her exactly what to say back.\n\nRun.", "NTA. He changed his story a few times (proving himself to be a liar). That whole situation is creepy. You need to get away from that guy ASAP. Run!!", "He changed his story a few times then texted friend what to say...I would make a thorough search. You can get camera detectors. I saw one on Amazon for about 50 bucks ..\nNTA", "Always trust your gut! If he didn\u2019t have hidden cameras, then there\u2019s no harm finding out. If he have hidden cameras, then aren\u2019t you lucky you found out? \n\nHaving said that, I\u2019m the type of person who likes to randomly search for stuff so it could just be curiosity too. But like I said, no harm checking. \n\nNTA", "But\u2026 he coached her on the story now. For all you know she\u2019s also a creep\u2026 No way to know if he was telling the truth based on her word at this point. I dunno, this feels fishy.", "NTA\n\nUmmmm why did he have to give his friend this whole story of the conversation? If they had it like he said all that he would have to do is bring up the hotel room and she'd know. Its definitely suspicious.", "Shady as hell. NTA.", "NTA. Your spidey senses are tingling. Trust your instincts and act accordingly.", "Don\u2019t jump to conclusions.  I have seen something on tv and internet and have researched lots of weird stuff. Doesn\u2019t mean I am doing it.   That said, keep your eyes open just in case.", "Also the fact that he initially told her that he would \"call\" his friend, but instead, resorted to texting her the details. If he would have actually called, it would have backfired, and he knows that.", "i'm begging you to please get out before something awful happens.\n\nNTA", "Exactly my thoughts! Would have been better for him to let her call and ask the question themselves, this was so led", "And, if it were true that would have actually been his first response!", "Also, he didn't call as he said. Because the friend would not be as good of an actor. He was definitely looking for a camera to spy.", "This. NTA. But so this. \nDeny. Gaslight. New lie. Text answer to friend for confirmation. \"Embarassed he had to do it\". Gaslight. \nTip of the iceberg here. \nBe careful.", "Also why would he need to search multiple ways.", "Thank you so much for sharing this", "The search history was from the AliExpress app, an app/ website used for buying things similar to amazon", "YUP! I noticed that too!", "This right here.  OP, please run.", "Or he has already bought one.", "> Get something that can jam WiFi Signals\n\nThat's not legal FYI", "If you don't find anything that doesn't mean he wasn't planning on doing it though. You should still end this relationship as it has red flags all over it.", "It is something I believe everyone should know. As technology progresses the creeps' ability to spy does too. Always learn how to best combat these issues, I've dealt with stalkers before so knowing this info saved me a lot.", "Notice that nobody has gone to AliExpress to help solve this issue. Because nobody thinks to shop for a spy camera, they search for how to find one. You\u2019d start with google, not a shopping app.", "Trust your gut here. The way he texted his friend was manipulative. He gave her the story of what exactly he wanted her to say/agree with. That actually makes him seem worse. You've only invested a few months into this relationship, I'd walk.", "He gave his friend a script. \n\nBut also remember that he lied about searching for hidden cameras initially. If it were innocent searching, why lie about it?", "His text to his friend is the most obvious evidence you have that he is lying to you.", "The text was instructions for them to lie!", "NTA but run far away fast from this guy", "He pretended to have no idea what you were talking about, then lied to your face and acted like Google made it a suggestion. If he had nothing to hide he wouldn't have tried to lie to you.", "OP this is one of very few comments that don\u2019t tell you to trust your gut and take precautions. NTA and call a longterm trusted friend or family member.", "I suspect the real evidence here is the conversation afterwards.  I'd be willing to guess that about 10% of readers in this thread were curious cheap spy cameras actually cost nowadays just because of this post.  Suspect I'll have spy cameras show up in my google ads for the next week now.", "Ok, fair. But I search stuff I don't buy on Amazon all the time.\n\nSo again, that being in his search history is no evidence that he had, has, or ever planned to have one of those put in.", "Personally, maybe I'm naive I don't know, I would accept pretty much any justification because for example, he might want to get one for his home in case he's missing stuff for example, or for security measures and he can't afford a real camera. But all of his reaction is just suspicious as hail.", "Google how to access the config page on your router. There should be an option to view all connected devices. Count all of your connected devices, if there are any extra then you know.", "A camera lens can be as narrow as the head of a sewing needle. I've seen some that poke through the little holes in ceiling tiles and are virtually invisible. Trivial to hide in a vent, smoke detector, motion sensor, clock, etm.", ">Now I'm remembering the first time he came to my place he took a photo of the shelf next to my bed when he thought I was out of the room.\n\nSo he can make sure he put it back looking the same, so you wouldn't notice. Absolutely check that shelf.", "There are devices, even apps I think, that can help detect some of these things. You should absolutely look into them. This really is shady AF.", "Check that shelf, check your air vents, check in between books if you have book cases, check everywhere you don't think it would be possible for there to be a camera because they can make them super small and they can come disguised as other things too.", "You should be able to use the FRONT camera on your phone to look for hidden lenses. Most front cameras don\u2019t have an infrared filter on them and will therefore be able to pick up the glint of a lenses. I would google the method in full, but the short form of it is that you just make the room as dark as you can and then slowly move around/spin while using your front camera to check over your shoulder/behind you. If you catch a \u201cglint\u201d it\u2019s likely a lenses.  \n\nAlso, no matter what, if there is a camera, it requires a power source, so if there is one, it\u2019ll need to be near something it can pull power from.", "I gasped when I read that. Who takes a photo of a shelf in their girlfriend's bedroom? And taking a photo of a spot above the bed THE FIRST TIME--as in, he didn't want to waste anytime in case things didn't work out--tells you your gut is right.\n\nIf you don't break up with him, be sure to instal a camera of your own in your room so you can see what he does when you're not there.", "They have some scanner you can buy to check. And log into your home\u2019s wifi and check what devices are on there and change the password on your wifi", "Turn all the lights out and scan the room with your phone camera.  Your eyes can't pick up IR light but your phone will show it as a blinking light(point a TV remote at the lens and hold a button down for an example of what to look for).", "Quick tip, if you have a friend with a VR headset like the oculus quest, they work off of ir sensors in the controllers. Those headsets often have a pass-through mode where you can see the room instead of the VR environment via those ir cameras. \n\nMost cameras that are used as hidden cameras have an ir camera (for low light situations) that can be seen like a light bulb via the pass-through mode.", "Might be a good idea to actually do what he's claiming he did - look up spy cameras and see what they look like. It'll be easier to find them if you know what to look for. Plus, you can buy tools to help you find them.\n\nAnd if you do find some, don't just break up with him. Press criminal charges. Put that AH in jail so he doesn't do this to anyone else.", "Yes, he is filming you without your consent. Check in vents, check everywhere. \"Hidden spy camera\" is not something a normal person Google. Please leave this relationship ASAP.", "OP, these cameras can be tiny and can be hidden in pretty much anything. You're only limited by your imagination as to where these cameras can be put. There are plenty of relatively inexpensive devices you can purchase that can help locate hidden devices. For your own peace of mind I suggest researching and purchasing one and checking every inch of your home AND vehicle.\n\nTrust your gut.", "Do not let him in your house. There is an app called Fing that will tell you all the devices that are using your internet.", "Get a camera detector", "It's not legal in your own home to jam your own signal? Odd.", "The fact that he literally told his friend what to tell OP word for word is a MASSIVE red flag, as well as the fact that he tried to lie about the search history at first. If he had really helped his friend look for spy cameras he would have asked her \u201cHey, what did I help you out with back when you were staying at a hotel.\u201d As a way to verify.", "This is excellent advice. My husband does this semi regularly just in case.", "OP if you need help with this DM me and I can assist.  The router settings can vary slightly for each router.  Get the brand and google RouterName Access.  Many times on YouTube there are tutorials that walk you through the settings.", "and tell a loved one about the confrontation and perhaps even ask if you can stay at theirs in case things get bad.", "On a pc- go to \u2018command\u2019 in the start menu, type ipconfig, enter. That gives you the default gateway IP. Then put that into your internet and it should come up with your router. They do vary but you might be able to see the current attached devices or possibly previously attached devices.", "I had one that I hid in my wedding bouquet. It was 1 inch by 1 inch but I know I could find ones smaller.", "Yep. This is what I used to do when I cleaned for someone that had loads of ornaments! So it would be look like I'd move the carefully arranged things. \n\nNote: I did NOT place a camera there!", "I'm hoping she got lucky and he hadn't yet put the camera there but was preparing so that when he did, he'd be able to put everything back right.", "At this point, I would hope that she would have broken up with him.\n\nLet's just say he didn't put any cameras and is innocent, it doesn't matter. If she can believe he'd do this, she can never trust him again.", "I have but that was because I saw a youtube video of someone searching and finding like 30 in a room that looked innocent.  I was curious on how small they could get and decided to never use Air bnb again.  I also looked into them when I was making my wedding bouquet as I wanted a small camera to record the ceremony as I walked down the aisle.  They can have uses but the BF is acting sketchy on top of it.", "Yeah.... thing is, just like your wifi signal the jammer does not actually stay inside your own home. You cannot reliably restrain something like that inside your own home unless your whole home is perfectly sealed off for such signals. \n\nSo kinda understandable that jamming is illegal since it can wreak havoc on important things.", "In the US jamming a radio signal is very illegal with [no exceptions for use in a residence](https://www.fcc.gov/general/jammer-enforcement#:~:text=Federal%20law%20prohibits%20the%20operation,Global%20Positioning%20Systems%20(GPS\\).)", "He, in fact, did not respond to her with a straight forward answer.", "Hmm okay fair. I'll adjust my judgement.", "Sure but temporarily to find out if someone did something illegal in my home I think I'd deal with whatever consequences if any. That said, how can schools or a teacher keep a jammer to one room only? Would simple brick walls trap the jammer in that specific classroom then? I'm actually asking, not arguing or anything. Teachers brought them to school and would jam the signal in only their classrooms. If that's possible then I'm not understanding how a house couldn't be the same I guess", "Schools do it with no issue oddly enough. I think I'd be completely fine blocking my own signal to figure out if someone put a camera in my home tho.", "I urge you to actually read and understand stories about this topic and more related to this because I, clearly, am not equipped with the right words to make you understand the point I'm trying to make. I wish you the best.", "oh i get your point i just think you're wrong", "go touch some grass"]}
