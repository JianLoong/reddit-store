Not worth the abuse you will likely get at the wedding.\n\nMy guess is that Chloe does not value your friendship.  Why would she pair a 6'0\" woman with a 5'5\" man?  I can think of a few reasons but none of them are good.", "NTA but Tommy and Chloe are. Nothing is really an excuse to be a dick & tbh his comment about you was waaaaay worse than your response. You went easy on him. And Chloe is for defending his behavior.

Just tell your friend:\n\n\"Thanks for asking me to be a bridesmaid. I thought carefully about your disclosure that I am required to stay quiet through rude comments and insults to my appearance and decided that is not something I can do. Regardless of who is making the comments, I can't not take being called ugly personally, especially considering the bullying I experienced growing up. I'm sure you'll be able to find a great replacement but I would suggest warning them ahead of time as a courtesy.

If not, say, \n\n\"It really sucked when you told me you want me to stay in quiet while being called ugly. Whatever excuses you've made for your cousin, cruelty is not a symptom of autism and it's not a free pass to insult me without consequence. I cannot participate in your wedding as a bridesmaid or guest because of your dismissal of my feelings. I hope you are kinder to my replacement and forewarn them of the treatment they should expect.\"", "NTA, and you shouldn\u2019t have to go to weddings where you are treated like this. You can\u2019t change the world (there will always be insecure, small men and their enablers) but you can change who you choose to give your time to.\n\nAlso, OP, you sound awesome! I wish I had the discipline you seem to have in my 20s!", "Quit this wedding. Your friend should have had your back - instead she doubled down on her jerk relative.

Tell her immediately so she can make other arrangements. \n\nAnyone that would speak like that about you...he's not willing to \"go along\" and I wouldn't try to pretend. \n\nThe bride should be informing her parents and her cousins parents. Right away. What happens beyond that isn't your business.  \n\nNo way he's going to stand there quietly with you, might as well let the bride know.

THEY owe you an apology.", "NTA Tommy is a loser and quite frankly so is your friend.", "NTA. Stick up for yourself girlboss!!", "NTA, autism is no excuse for boorish behavior.", "NTA, Tommy learned an important lesson about not dishing it out if he can't take it.\nHe's 20 years old, surely that's a concept he's encountered before.", "NTA, your so called friend and him are, drop the toxic people from your life and move on!!", "Sorry Autism does not cause assholeness.   NTA", "NTA- but you will be if you don\u2019t walk away from this wedding. You deserve better than snide comments and people who supposedly care about you endorsing that behaviour.

She doesn\u2019t sound like a very good friend.", "NTA.\n\nYou sound awesome, I hope you can find more confidence in yourself because you deserve it.\n\nI don't think I have much more to add that hasn't been said. Your friend isn't behaving like a friend. Tommy doesn't a pass for cruelty due to autism. I think you'd have a better time kicking back on the couch with a movie than going to the wedding.", "NTA. I hate that your \u201cfriend\u201d is blaming you for an interaction that was a direct result of Tommy\u2019s rudeness. \n\nAnd his comment in no way can be attributed to any potential \u201cno filter\u201d aspect of autism. That comment was filtered for maximum nastiness.", "NTA - autism is not an excuse for his behavior, especially at his age.  \n\nAs for your friend, she needs to back up.  I don't see how you returning a comment and then leaving would have ruined the rest of the night, unless Tommy went on and on.  And at that point, he ruined the night.", "I'm autistic and can be very straightforward. His remark was not caused by autism. It was caused by entitlement, misogyny, and cruelty. And apparently Chloe shares his values. If this kind of behavior from them is a pattern, you might want to think about whether the wedding is all you should quit, or if there are some so-called friends who need to go entirely. You should not be getting abused at any weddings for any reason. NTA.", "NTA. He is though.", "NTA and she\u2019s not much of a friend if she\u2019s justifying his behavior bc of autism. It gives him no excuse. \n\nYou don\u2019t deserve to put up with him, her or continued comments about how you look.", "NTA. Not every autistic person is an absolute asshole. Being an asshole is not an autistic trait, so this trend of justifying assholish behaviour with \u201cbut autism\u201d is gross on Chloe\u2019s part.\n\nIf I were you, I would probably not continue being involved in the wedding party.", "Very obviously NTA. And if your friend can't see that, tell her she should find someone else to be a bridesmaid.", "NTA \nUninvite yourself and cut ties. There is no excuse for his behavior", "NTA. He clearly felt bad when you \u201cretaliated\u201d by pointing out that he didn\u2019t look like a celebrity either. Seems like he completely understands how hurtful it is to comment negatively on someone\u2019s appearance. Being neurodivergent absolutely does not mean people have to like you. Equity is giving someone who is neurodivergent a little extra social breadth, it is not allowing someone to say rude shit to your face and expect to still be liked or treated in a friendly way. Being different does not mean you aren\u2019t unlikeable and, while it can give context to bad behavior, it does not excuse it.", "NTA, she should've stuck up for you. She's a shit friend.", "NTA for saying something mean back; this isn't a situation where a child should be told to turn the other cheek or something. It was grossly inappropriate and I think you should remove yourself from the situation.\n\n\nOne note: Your comment makes it clear this is an ongoing issue. I don't have any good advice, but you should chat with someone about it since it is obviously eating at you. Sounds like there is a lot of hurt stemming back a long way.", "NTA and your friend is shitty for not having your back", "NTA. like seriously. He can dish it but not take it.  You do what you need to do to make you happy.", "Yeah, NTA and he is. I will say this, you\u2019re 6ft in good shape and badass. He\u2019s overweight 5\u20195 and a dead ender.
