Have more confidence in yourself. My ex was a 5'9 Wrestler and was probably the best partner I've had.", "dont give in to people who dont respect you YTA if you belittle yourself to please them", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry the guy was rude to you. Those in short fat glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones, or they shall learn the stones coming back aren\u2019t fun!", "My son is autistic. He also knows that words hurt.   \nHe understands that saying mean things can make someone feel bad and potentially harm themselves.\n\nHe understands that at 10 years old.   \nWith autism.\n\nTommy is 10 years old than him.\n\nIt's not autism. Tommy's just an asshole.", "Nta. I'd dip on the wedding. The bride has shown that you aren't a close enough friend for you to waste your time and money as her bridesmaid. A friend would have called her cousin out on being an ass.", "NTA you should back out", "Nta and you need new friends sorry this happened to you \ud83d\udc90", "NTA and NTA if you decide to quit the wedding. Chloe is being a shitty friend.", "NTA- I\u2019d definitely quit the wedding party. And bring a hot guy/girl to the wedding as your date lol.", "Impressive clap back.\nNTA.\n\nAlso, happy cake day. \ud83c\udf70", "Quit. Tommy is an AH and so is your friend. I would make her an ex friend while you\u2019re at it. NTA.", "This sucks, and that dudes a moron. id kill to meet a muscular strong woman like yourself! It always makes me mad to see people act like muscular women arent beautiful.  I know Im some stranger and dont matter, but believe me, a lot of guys adore tall amazonian strong women", "Nah If this guy has enough mental capacity to say \"she isn't girly enough\" then he definitely doesn't get an autism pass.  I would kindly tell your \"friend\" that you'd rather have self respect than be in her wedding.  Don't be afraid to drop shitty people from your life.", "NTA. My heart goes out to you. I've been raised that it's bad manners to make personal remarks to and about someone. You can't help what you received in the genetics raffle. Thing is you've made the most of your build through your choice of profession. Unfortunately, we live in a society that still holds women to a higher standard of conventional beauty than men. Men are allowed to age, go bald, get pot bellies, wrinkles and still be considered socially acceptable. In contrast women age and become hags and invisible.  Tommy was in the wrong by making such an insulting statement in front of you and anyone in earshot. You had a right to speak up for yourself. Those in glass houses.. etc.\n\nFor me, the real issue is your \"friend\" trying to fault you for the set-to that you did not provoke. At least, she ought to have apologized for her brother and left the matter alone.\n\nIt's clear your friend is excusing her brother's cruel behavior because of a disability. Sometimes, though, there are no excuses. It's going to be up to you to take a firm line as to what you will and won't tolerate from others when it comes to any snide comments about your appearance.\n\nIt may be hard but try not to embrace the criticisms of your appearance. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. You may be someone's ideal woman just as you are.", "Quit the wedding. Fuck that guy.", "NTA. But your friend is, and isn't being a good friend to you right now. I don't care if it's my family or not, they aren't allowed to insult my friends. Your friend and her rude family member owes you an apology. \n\nAnd I would say it's better to just not expose yourself to more of that family and bow out of the wedding party. If there are other cool people you're comfortable with who are going, you can just be a guest and still support your friend (if she earns back your trust and it's something you want to do).", "Just quit. Chole doesn't sound like much of a friend.", "NTA. And yes, if you choose to do so, hand back this dubious honour since it comes with having to  put up with ill manners and sexism.\nAs for upsetting the cousin, I think you were pretty decent in your retort given how incredibly rude he was.\nLife is too short to put up with rude strangers and shit friends. \nPut on a pair of heels or boots and go have fun instead.", "If she thinks it\u2019s OK to criticize your behavior and justify his, I would dump them immediately. NTA.", "Not only are you NTA, you need to follow up on the Not The Bridesmaid, at least with Chloe.", "NTA\n\nQuit the bridal party.  Find people who will appreciate you.", ">\u201cf@ck, why do I always get the ugly girls? OwlTea looks like a man!\u201d\n\nThats not autism, thats being an asshole, and trying to excuse it as autism is insulting as hell.", "NTA. I'm autistic and I definitely know the difference between pointing something out (you being tall) and being a bully. That's what he is. A bully. \n\nShe is not your friend since she wants you to apologize for standing up for yourself against her shitty cousin.", "NTA. I upvoted the top comment and just wanted to say I'm sorry that happened to you. No need to spend another second anywhere near Tommy, and no need to go through any hoops for Chloe. She's made it clear: Tommy can be an a$$ and get a pass, but you will be chastised for doing anything but letting yourself be talked about/to and treated that way.", "This. So much this. OP you are NTA - Chloe is not a friend - and Tommy is a douchecanoe. You don't need that crap in your life.\n\nUpvoting this and every reply so it gets seen.", "These are both perfect. I would add that if others ask, OP might say \u201cunfortunately, it was important to Bride that I allow  Groomsman to make mean comments about my looks without saying anything in return, and I felt unable to do that.\u201d", "Absolutely this. I'm autistic, and I'm often too blunt, or tone-deaf, or just plain oblivious. It's something I've spent a long time working on, because I don't want to hurt people or be insensitive. I still put my foot in my mouth sometimes, but I always go back to give a genuine apology (ie \"hey, I'm so sorry about what I said. I'm autistic and not very good in social situations, but I recognize I was out of line. I didn't intend to hurt you\"). \n\nAlso, my social blunders are nowhere near as bad as outright saying somebody is ugly and I don't want to be around them. That's not a neurodivergent moment of putting your foot in your mouth, or even a \"I got overwhelmed and already had a lot of forks to deal with that day and I snapped\". That's just plain cruelty.", "Yea it is. When mommy and daddy let him get away with it because of his autism then it\u2019s 100% to blame. It\u2019s not the handicap thats the issue tho. It\u2019s the ah enablers who justify his ah actions with his autism. They\u2019re all ass holes.", "I\u2019m autistic. It\u2019s a BS excuse. His problem isn\u2019t his autism\u2014his problem is that he\u2019s an asshole.", "Yeah, blaming this on autism seems Incredibly insulting to other autistic people.", "NTA. I would drop the friend as well as the wedding.", "You deserve better than snide remarks and the endorsement of that behavior by people who supposedly care about you (op).", "Because you are taller and in better physical condition than Tommy, you clearly pose a threat to the insecure AH.", "Am also autistic. My filters are frequently bad but it\u2019s always been more of \u201coverly blunt\u201d sort of way, not insulting other people. Fortunately most of my coworkers find it funny rather than off putting \n\nI am sick and tired of people excusing bad behavior with autism. Maybe it doesn\u2019t come naturally to us and the subtleties will escape us, but we can learn not to blurt out horribly offensive things. And if the cousin can\u2019t, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t be part of the wedding.", "Normally they're paired by height, and the pairings last as long as the wedding, so the relationships don't matter.  Your friend is going out of her way  for her couple friends so they won't be separated walking down the aisle after the ceremony?  Yeesh.  Bail on her.", "I sent you a chat request.  Dont let her or anyone make you feel insecure.  Muscular women are beautiful", "Yeah agree. Even more so shouldn't be insulting someone with a mental illness...", "Oh my god, yes. I'm so sick of it! We're neurodivergent, not inherently assholes. I feel like I see this sort of thing (using autism as a excuse for terrible behaviour) in people with a lot of privilege as just another layer of their classicism.", "Yeah same! I can come off rude and abrasive sometimes but if I were to make a rude comment about someone's appearance it would be more along the lines of \"you have [physical traits]\" because I think it's cool when woman big and strong but forget that announcing someone's physical features might be seen as making fun of them. I, on the other hand, did pass kindergarten and I do know what ugly means. No connotations excuse there."]}
