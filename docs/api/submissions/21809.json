All the names have been changed as well.)\r  \n\r  \nMy Dad (44M) and stepmom Leah (46F) have been married for 10 years. But we\u2019ve lived together since I (17F) was 5 and my stepsister Sarah (18F) was 6.\r  \n\r  \nAround the time we were 12, Sarah started getting in trouble at school. It was small stuff at first but then it became constant and she started getting in trouble outside of school as well.\r  \n\r  \nMy Dad and Leah always said how Sarah was \u201cjust trying to fit in with her friends\u201d and pretty much just ignored it because they said they \u201cjust had to wait\u201d for Sarah and her friends to \u201cgrow out of it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSarah\u2019s been out of control since she was 15. My Dad and Leah keep their car keys locked in a safe yet Sarah still manages to steal them and drive unlicensed. She\u2019s bragged to people about driving drunk/high.\r  \n\r  \nSarah has been arrested more than a few times. But she\u2019s never actually spent time in jail for more than a few hours, if even that, before being allowed to go home.\r  \n\r  \nI strongly suspect that my Dad and Leah have been bribing people or pulling some other strings to keep Sarah out of jail. But I stay quiet about it since I know I don\u2019t have any actual evidence.\r  \n\r  \nTwo weeks ago, my friend Emma came over and we hung out in the backyard. Sarah came up in the conversation and Emma asked me what I thought was going to happen to Sarah now that she\u2019s 18 and is also out of high school.\r  \n\r  \nThis is the part where I could be the asshole: I told Emma that because of all the crap Sarah does, she will end up serving serious jail time and I will feel nothing but relief the day that Sarah does inevitably go to jail.\r  \n\r  \nIt turns out that Leah was in our laundry room. Our laundry room has a screen window to the backyard where Emma and I were hanging out, so Leah overheard what I said to Emma.\r  \n\r  \nAfter Emma left, my Dad and Leah both confronted me about what I said. Leah told me she was appalled by what I said about Sarah because she\u2019s been my sister for 10 years yet I said I would be relieved to see her go to jail.\r  \n\r  \nLater my Dad came into my room and told me that he knows I can\u2019t change how I feel. But that Leah is terrified of what is going to happen to Sarah now that she\u2019s 18. So saying what I said out loud was unnecessary and incredibly insensitive to her.\r  \n\r  \nEmma says that it may not have been the kindest thing to say about Sarah, but that I was just being honest and Leah shouldn\u2019t have eavesdropped if she wasn\u2019t prepared to hear something negative about her daughter.\r  \n\r  \nI just got back to my Dad and Leah\u2019s house after a week at my Mom's house though and things are still pretty tense between us, especially me and Leah. I\u2019m starting to doubt Emma\u2019s words and whether or not I was the asshole for what I said.

And your father's wife should not have been listening in on a private conversation.\n\nHowever, word to the wise. In the future, if a private conversation with a friend turns to a sensitive or delicate topic, excuse yourself for a moment and make sure that you actually have appropriate privacy.  Or suggest that you and your friend  go for a coffee or something else where you won't be around family members, before continuing the conversation.  \n\nIt's a good habit to have.  And it applies in many situations, such as if someone is gossiping to you at work about a troublesome colleague.  Making sure of privacy when a private conversation gets fraught helps avoid a world of troubles.", "I think your parents have to confront Sarah.

Yes, but it\u2019s the damn truth and it was a private court between you and a friend.

You did apologize to Leah, right? If not, do so.\n\nYou were confiding in your friend. It's not Leah's fault that she was in the laundry room.
