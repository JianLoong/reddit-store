But we\u2019ve lived together since I (17F) was 5 and my stepsister Sarah (18F) was 6.\r  \n\r  \nAround the time we were 12, Sarah started getting in trouble at school. It was small stuff at first but then it became constant and she started getting in trouble outside of school as well.\r  \n\r  \nMy Dad and Leah always said how Sarah was \u201cjust trying to fit in with her friends\u201d and pretty much just ignored it because they said they \u201cjust had to wait\u201d for Sarah and her friends to \u201cgrow out of it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSarah\u2019s been out of control since she was 15. My Dad and Leah keep their car keys locked in a safe yet Sarah still manages to steal them and drive unlicensed. She\u2019s bragged to people about driving drunk/high.\r  \n\r  \nSarah has been arrested more than a few times. But she\u2019s never actually spent time in jail for more than a few hours, if even that, before being allowed to go home.\r  \n\r  \nI strongly suspect that my Dad and Leah have been bribing people or pulling some other strings to keep Sarah out of jail. But I stay quiet about it since I know I don\u2019t have any actual evidence.\r  \n\r  \nTwo weeks ago, my friend Emma came over and we hung out in the backyard. Sarah came up in the conversation and Emma asked me what I thought was going to happen to Sarah now that she\u2019s 18 and is also out of high school.\r  \n\r  \nThis is the part where I could be the asshole: I told Emma that because of all the crap Sarah does, she will end up serving serious jail time and I will feel nothing but relief the day that Sarah does inevitably go to jail.\r  \n\r  \nIt turns out that Leah was in our laundry room. Our laundry room has a screen window to the backyard where Emma and I were hanging out, so Leah overheard what I said to Emma.\r  \n\r  \nAfter Emma left, my Dad and Leah both confronted me about what I said. Leah told me she was appalled by what I said about Sarah because she\u2019s been my sister for 10 years yet I said I would be relieved to see her go to jail.\r  \n\r  \nLater my Dad came into my room and told me that he knows I can\u2019t change how I feel. But that Leah is terrified of what is going to happen to Sarah now that she\u2019s 18. So saying what I said out loud was unnecessary and incredibly insensitive to her.\r  \n\r  \nEmma says that it may not have been the kindest thing to say about Sarah, but that I was just being honest and Leah shouldn\u2019t have eavesdropped if she wasn\u2019t prepared to hear something negative about her daughter.\r  \n\r  \nI just got back to my Dad and Leah\u2019s house after a week at my Mom's house though and things are still pretty tense between us, especially me and Leah.

It was going to be YTA until your dad said\n\n> Leah is terrified of what is going to happen to Sarah now that she is 18. \n\nHer own mother is afraid. Some kind of parent she is. Hopefully you haven\u2019t been influenced by the shitty parenting.", " Wouldn't you expect Sarah to go through rehab before going to jail, perhaps at the urging of her parents? \n  \nI wonder how effective a rehab program is?", "NTA- If she keeps acting like she did in highschool she inevitably will end up going to jail at some point, had a few bullies like her that never suffered any consequences for their behavior as kids and ended up in prison as adults.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty crappy that they are more concerned about your stepmom\u2019s fragile feelings instead of concerned about how all of the stuff with your SS has affected you mentally and emotionally.", "NTA. They might not want to hear it, but driving drunk or high could get somebody killed, maybe herself. If this is a pattern they should be doing something other than policing what you have to say about it!  \n\n\nWhen they notice keys missing it's time to call the police. Or maybe just not even wait for that! Find her a rehab. Anything other than locking up the keys and calling it good.", "NTA\n\nIf Leah was so concerned, she could've stopped in at any point in the last 5+ years. Your step sister is driving drunk/high, and she could KILL SOMEONE!  There's probably worse things you don't even know about. She's a danger to herself, others, your entire family..", "NTA. Hopefully it'll serve as a wake up call. If not, enjoy prison!", "NTA AT ALL. Your stepmom loves her child and has on blinders. Of course it hurts her to hear that. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s untrue or that you\u2019re wrong for feeling that way. You didn\u2019t say it in a way that was meant to be heard. You were confiding in your friend, that\u2019s what friends do. They are there to let us vent our feelings like a therapist. You can tell a friend you hate someone\u2019s new hair cut. Does that make you an AH? No you\u2019re saying it to your friend not the person with said haircut. Leah was eavesdropping first off. Even if she didn\u2019t mean to hear it she should\u2019ve pretended like she didn\u2019t. If I had to guess this really has very little to do with you saying it. I\u2019m betting it has more to do with the fact that she\u2019s already fearing this and it just gave her an outlet to be upset out loud without voicing her real concern. People, especially young adults, generally do not learn and only get worse when they have no repercussions from their actions. I\u2019m guessing Leah knows this and is afraid that she messed up with Sarah.", "NTA. It is absolutely normal and important to talk with friends about your life and feelings. Your stepmother was eavesdropping, that's more her problem than yours.  \nI also understand your stepmother in the sense of what your father said: That the stepmother is afraid of what will happen when your stepsister grows up. It is a tense situation.  \nBut you are still absolutely NOT an asshole for talking to a friend about feelings, or for feeling that way.", "nta", "Listen not at keyholes lest ye be vexed \n\n\nNTA", "NTA FWIW sometimes people start to feel this way about blood relatives that they truly love because it\u2019s so difficult living with the chaos the person creates and/or they engage in such risky behaviors that they feel the person is actually less likely to die in jail than out on the street.", "I don't think that people realise how traumatic it can be to have a sibling who behaves like this. People end up in therapy to deal with growing up with someone like this. Your dad and Leah probably don't understand how deeply Sarah's behaviour has affected you. In fact, you might not even realise how traumatised you are for a long time yet. You're NTA and if I were you, I would seriously consider making a plan to remove yourself from this situation as soon as possible.", "> But that Leah is terrified of what is going to happen to Sarah now that she\u2019s 18.\n\nGood. Maybe now she\u2019ll understand the consequences that come from her bad parenting.\n\nNTA", "Maybe instead of being upset about what you said, Leah should focus on Sarah and actually do something about her bad behavior. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour dad is the biggest asshole of the bunch. He's supposed to be your advocate, and instead of asking his wife why she's eavesdropping on private conversations you have with your friends, he decided that her feelings were the most important thing. This is one step off \"My wife read your diary, and didn't like what she found\" levels of thinking with your penis.", ">Sarah (and the adults in her life) are about to enter the find-out phase of her behaviour.\n\nNTA\n\nSadly, they didn't properly handle things. The find-out phase may be causing vehicular manslaughter because people who DUI are AHs that ruin innocent lives.", "You saying it or not saying it doesn't mean it won't happen.", "This. I have abusive family members where everything you say is used against you. I've learnt to keep personal conversations in a safe space.", "Leah is acting like a \"oh, boo-hoo me\" character while Sarah should be put behind bars.", "I think you meant to comment this on a different post...", "Wtf?", "This was meant for a different post.\n\nThey were also NTAs in that post!", "It makes sense that locking her up would make you and the public feel safer. The way your dad and Leah are responding makes it seem like you said something to anger her on purpose, but that is plainly not what happened. If I were you, I would have made the same remark about Sarah.", "I mean...Danny Trejo would like a word...", ">Get a grip.\n\nAlright, what's your solution?", "Have you considered that she will eventually get out of jail, and will probably come out worse?\n\nI'd feel more relief if she got help. The penal system has a terrible track record for fixing people.", "This is especially worrying along with the not caring", "Adult punitive systems in the US are set up to create a cycle of reoffending. This is what happens when you make prison systems private. Zero people are set up for success when leaving prison. Some find it anyway, but 20%-30% isn\u2019t a number to look at and say \u201csee? This is a good system that gives focus to rehabilitation and positively serves the public!\u201d 70%-80% shows a heavy trend, not an open opportunity for betterment. There is just about zero focus on restoration and rehabilitation. Meaning, learning isn\u2019t a part of this, and the road to betterment is intentionally made difficult.\n\nI\u2019m not saying OP is wrong in her stance, nor am I saying the parents totally did right by this kid, but that\u2019s still really difficult to navigate when there aren\u2019t accessible and plentiful restorative systems for teens as well as adults. I\u2019m saying the thought process around \u201clearning\u201d here is far more complicated than being presented in this thread, when we lack actual programs.", "They do. Sarah just doesn't care at all. That's why they keep their car keys in a locked safe. Sarah still manages to steal the keys.", "I checked Dutch stats, where prison is not a for profit system like USA. We're also known for very soft prisons with a very strong focus on rehabilition. We even have a social safety net (financial and mental) for when they're out. Even then we still have a 70% going back to crime.\n\nIt's time for people to realize the truth: Criminals are wired differently and we need to stop thinking we can fix them all. We simply can't. \n\nEasy NTA OP btw. Her mother should have taught her better when she was younger.", "In math they teach you that in statistics if a percentage is as high as 0.5 then that's when you can include it, if 0.5 people were rehabilitated after prison than that's statistically relevant, bit it's not 0.5 it's 30 percent. I'll let you do the math on which number is bigger", "How?", "Yeah, this comment is not correct. Whether or not something is statistically relevant depends on things like sample size. You can't just pull out a random percentage like 0.5% and say that it's statistically relevant, that doesn't make any sense.", "But they learned that fact \"in math\"!"]}
