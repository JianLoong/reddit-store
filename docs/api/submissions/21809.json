This isn't a good environment for a teenager or young adult to be in. \n\nSarah needs to face the consequences of her dangerous actions and Leah needs to face reality and touch grass. Your dad thankfully recognizes that what you said is true and , but he's wrong to get on your case for saying it in a private conversation. If it was with someone random and in public around others who had no business knowing about what was going on, I might agree with him that more discretion is advisable, but that's not the case - Emma knows both you and Sarah and she knows what Sarah has been up to, and she's a close friend and you were talking privately at your house about a very stressful situation, not to some random out in public. Leah shouldn't be eavesdropping on others' conversations, especially as Sarah is an adult and you're almost an adult; if she could hear you, she should've spoken up and told you \"hey, I can hear you, if you want more privacy then maybe go in the front yard or go for a walk\". You were having a private conversation with Emma, which was not for Leah's amusement or for her ears. NTA; you cannot trust that you will have privacy anymore at your dad's house or that it will be taken seriously when you express valid concerns for your living situation (what happens if Sarah brings her criminal activity home and/or if the police show up? That's very traumatic). \n\nLeah is TA for not taking your conversation with Emma in one ear and out the other and ignoring it, especially as she's out of touch with reality; if she was in touch with reality and had not enabled Sarah so much, the conversation with Emma would never even have had to happen because you wouldn't have been stressed. While I do think that it's a harsh thing to say about someone with whom you've grown up, Leah needed to hear it, and your dad, as her husband, needs to set her right. \n\nAll that having been said, teenagers don't just turn to intense criminal activity the way Sarah is (smoking an occasional bong or having an occasional beer, while technically illegal, is one thing; but breaking into a safe and stealing a car (AKA grand theft auto and serious property damage offenses) and drunk/high driving and other similar offenses is a WHOLE separate ballgame) without something having happened. What is Sarah's side? Why does she feel such a need to act out? Was she thrown to the side in some ways when Leah and your dad got married, did you become the favorite child? Was she abused? Sexually assaulted? Bullied? How is your and her relationship aside from the criminal activity and how do the two of you get on? Was Leah or your dad (or both) often absent due to work or other family obligations when you were growing up, leaving both of you with only one of them or with other adults (or even on your own with no adults) for a large majority of the time? You don't mention anything in your post which would've caused her acting out so severely; that doesn't just happen in isolation. Some boundary pushing is VERY normal (see above - the occasional bong or occasional beer), but to the extent to which Sarah is going is very concerning, and the fact that Leah is minimizing it and has always done that is outright neglectful, which, when Sarah was a minor, would've been a form of child abuse.

As time went on, I had to come to the realization that I never helped him at all, I enabled him to continue his behaviors. We were toxic to each other through those years. When I finally realized my own behaviors were a contributing factor, I stepped back and went NC. I told him when he figured it all out to call me and not a day sooner.

It is in no way your fault that your step-sister was eavesdropping.", "Soft NTA, mostly because that was a  private conversation with your friend.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth reflecting on why you would feel relief. Do you want Sarah to get better, or do you want her to get her comeuppance? If it\u2019s the former, jail/prison is not the answer.\n\nSarah\u2019s indiscretions are concerning but mostly petty. Getting drunk/high with friends and taking her parents\u2019 car are bad, but plenty of teens do this and this can be solved privately without police involvement. Driving inebriated is never defensible as it endangers her and other people, but it\u2019s unclear to what extent she does this. Importantly, Sarah does not sound violent, nor has she explicitly harmed you (or you haven\u2019t shared that information). \n\nFrom your perspective, your dad and stepmom are not doing much to help Sarah. That could be true, but it\u2019s possible that they are trying to intervene with therapy, punishment, conversations, etc., and you\u2019re just not privy to that information. Changing someone\u2019s behavior is *really* hard \u2014 it\u2019s something that can take years (or a lifetime) and often doesn\u2019t come about unless the person wants to change. Just talk to someone who has a loved one who struggles with addiction. \n\nIn any case, Sarah going to jail/prison will not solve that. However, it will greatly inhibit Sarah\u2019s opportunities to improve her behavior and turn into a well adjusted adult. She will have greater difficulty finding a stable job and she will be overburdened by dealing with court appointments, paperwork, and associated costs. She will have a much harder time finding a house or apartment. It sounds like your parents haven\u2019t given up on her, so that means she\u2019ll be dependent on them for several years thereafter. What won\u2019t be harder to get are drugs and alcohol, and if she does suffer from addiction, that will only feed this cycle. Sarah won\u2019t get better, and your parents will not get any relief. Consequently, you won\u2019t get relief either.\n\nA side note: I doubt your parents are pulling strings/paying people off to keep Sarah out of jail. It\u2019s far more likely that Sarah\u2019s arrests have been for crimes that don\u2019t warrant jail time. If she got caught drinking or smoking weed, she most likely got a ticket or a small misdemeanor. She would probably have to deal drugs before getting jail time. (The obvious and big caveat is her race, but the flippancy with which you refer to jail time makes me think that you and your family are not part of a race that\u2019s targeted by police.) \n\nIn sum, talk to your parents, apologize, and express your feelings, but also try to hear them out. Sarah is doing wrong, but it does sound mostly like petty teenage shit, and jail/prison isn\u2019t going to solve that. You\u2019re not an asshole. You just may need a little more perspective on what Sarah\u2019s behavior actually entails and why jail would never solve that.", "NTA you are entitled to your opinion.

At some point - and by this, I mean today, now that Sarah is 18 - Sarah has to be held responsible for her actions, good and bad.  Your father and Leah need to go to counseling for their own good, to learn how to disengage from the monster they created, simply by not allowing Sarah to suffer consequences.  Enabling is not love.  Their tolerance, acceptance, and silent encouragement (by way of doing nothing to curb it) of Sarah's behavior reflects poorly on every other member of the family.  What they should be reflecting on is that a complete outsider (Emma) so casually remarked on Sarah's behavior and the unspoken implication of her parents' tacit complicity in it up until this point.

This story reminds me so much of one of my nephews. (I'll note that my (half) sister is substantially older than I am and my nephew is only 7 years younger than I am.) Nephew was in and out of trouble all of his teen years. He stole my sisters car multiple times and that was the least of it. One time he ended up under house arrest with an ankle bracelet for over a year. His behavior kept escalating. The first time he went to prison (after turning 18) didn't set him straight, nor did the second stint in jail. The 3rd time he went to (federal) prison was on the 3 strikes law, but he deserved to stay there. He committed grand theft and the drove over state lines and held up a convenience store at gunpoint. The only reason he got out of prison (I assume he's out) was because 3 strikes was repealed. For all I know, he's already back inside...he's not a good dude and is one of the several reasons I am no contact with my half-sister and most of her family. \n\nI really hope, OP, that Leah and your dad will open their eyes and see that Sarah needs help and she needs it now. Of course, it may be too late...it's hard to add consequences and discipline when there really have been none in the past. It may take a bit of jail time to wake Sarah up.

Being an addict or mentally ill doesn\u2019t make one not a decent person. This is my point, it is a punitive system and our country lacks restorative systems.

It may take 3-5 times, but even if the want is there, if money isn\u2019t, then you don\u2019t have a lot of options regarding recovery assisted by professionals in a healthy environment. There are also predatory Medicaid scams masking as rehab clinics these days that pick up addicts, run their urine, charge insurance, then drop them off hundreds of miles away, not in a rehab. Now do you think this would be at all lucrative if there weren\u2019t a large amount of addicts wanting the help for as cheap as these scammers offer? \n\nOther countries absolutely do have restorative systems, particularly for mentally ill while we went backwards on that by deinstitutionalizing, giving folks nowhere to go if chronically mentally ill and in need of living assistance. State and federal funding continuously gets slashed around these systems, while more and more is poured into private prisons. Portugal has the lowest overdose rate in the world, when they had a big opioid problem. This was achieved by decriminalizing and adding highly accessible resources for help. Numbers don\u2019t lie.   \n\nI work in a shelter and am surrounded by folks that system fails every single day. Homelessness is criminalized, addiction is criminalized, mentally ill folks are treated like criminals.
