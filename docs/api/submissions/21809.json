It was small stuff at first but then it became constant and she started getting in trouble outside of school as well.\r  \n\r  \nMy Dad and Leah always said how Sarah was \u201cjust trying to fit in with her friends\u201d and pretty much just ignored it because they said they \u201cjust had to wait\u201d for Sarah and her friends to \u201cgrow out of it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSarah\u2019s been out of control since she was 15.

But she\u2019s never actually spent time in jail for more than a few hours, if even that, before being allowed to go home.\r  \n\r  \nI strongly suspect that my Dad and Leah have been bribing people or pulling some other strings to keep Sarah out of jail.

Our laundry room has a screen window to the backyard where Emma and I were hanging out, so Leah overheard what I said to Emma.\r  \n\r  \nAfter Emma left, my Dad and Leah both confronted me about what I said. Leah told me she was appalled by what I said about Sarah because she\u2019s been my sister for 10 years yet I said I would be relieved to see her go to jail.\r  \n\r  \nLater my Dad came into my room and told me that he knows I can\u2019t change how I feel. But that Leah is terrified of what is going to happen to Sarah now that she\u2019s 18.

The parents should have tried to solve this year's ago, at 18 she needs to want this change and work to improve like making new friends and such.", "For me, it only took one night to ensure that I would never have to return. Yes, some criminals do improve, but not everyone needs to go back and learn. Then there are those who are stuck on dumb, which makes it harder for them to understand.", "u/Viennasausages is not saying she\u2019s too young to understand what she\u2019s doing, just that there is a high likelihood she will be able to change in the right circumstances.\n\nFor people of any age \u201crock bottom\u201d is a myth \u2013 situations can always get worse, and all available evidence shows that people are *less* able to meaningfully reflect on and change bad patterns when they lack stability in their lives.", "I mean, Norway has a huge focus on rehabilitation over punishment, and has the lowest recidivism rate in the world. I don't think that's coincidental.", "That's really interesting, considering that the Netherlands not only has one of the lowest crime rates in the world to the point they're closing multiple prisons; but numerous studies say that the re-conviction rate is actually around 44%. Not 70% like you claim.\n\nAnd if we look at Norway's prison system, which is also built to rehabilitate rather than penalize and has the lowest re-conviction rate in the world.\n\nThey went from 70% of reoffenders in the 1990's down all the way down to 20%.", "Well, I also checked the stats for The Netherlands\u2019 recidivism rate, and I think you got your numbers inverted, because the rate is 16% for violent offenses and 44% for other offenses, or roughly 30%, not 70%. So, that kinda disproves your whole point. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351626/#:~:text=Reoffending%20rates%20in%20the%20Dutch,rates%20in%20the%20probation%20sample.", "I have a graduate degree in statistics.

I can only find one that checks \"within 2 years\", which well, doesn't really say anything about real recidivisme. Not all criminals get caught or fall back again in 2 years.", "So many mistakes, let me try again (sometimes my English sucks so much...)\n\nDo you have research for that for me? I can only find one that shows data on \"within 2 years\". Which is a different way to look at it than the 70% I'm using for my country. \n\nI also have to say that that research seems a bit tempered with. It excludes a whole group that should've been in. That makes me wonder if they did that on purpose.", "I know right! It amazes me as well. \n\nI know that number, the 44% is for \"within 2 years\". So that doesn't take anyone over 2 years into consideration. I used the actual Dutch government website, so I'm going to trust that over anything else tbh. \n\nI see that 20% is also \"within 2 years\". Do you happen to have the number for actual recidivisme? Otherwise I'll Google myself to see if I can find it. Don't speak the language, so getting the right sources is a bit tougher than for my own country.", "I looked this up on the actual Dutch government website: \"De recidive van deze groep blijft hoog. Na 2 jaar is ruim 70% opnieuw veroordeeld voor een misdrijf\". \n\nTo translate this for you: After 2 years 70% of the adults have been convicted again of a crime. \n\nThe difference between our comments is that your source only looks at \"within 2 years\" (it states this btw). Mine looks at the total and then makes the conclusion that already after 2 years 70% have been convicted again.\n\nhttps://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/recidive/verminderen-recidive#:~:text=Het%20percentage%20ex%2Dgedetineerden%20dat,is%20dat%20minder%3A%2034%25.", "Your English is absolutely fine!
