And the fact that their son, baby\u2019s father, has passed may make it easier for a case establishing visitation and overnights. \n\nPeople process grief differently and I never like to think the worst, but you mentioned how strange she\u2019s been acting towards you and the baby.

That is brutal. But it\u2019s amazing that a piece of him gets to live on in your daughter. Have your in-laws properly grieved? Now this is *all** speculation so really, take this with a grain of salt, but that may be part of the reason MIL struggles with you daughter. She is a living, breathing, piece of her son. When she looks at her, she sees both a miracle and a tragedy at the same time.\n\nI think it\u2019s admirable that you want your daughter to get to know her father through his family. I don\u2019t necessarily think you should give that up. But that all happens on *your* terms, so it\u2019s okay for you to maintain strict boundaries. And remember that your daughter will learn about her father from you, too. And also keep in mind that since, sadly, she never new her father personally, she may not connect with his memory the same way you or MIL will. I know that\u2019s not directly related to your post, but I know someone who\u2019s \u201cfather they never knew\u201d dominated their lives because the people in his family that *did* know him were relentless with their comparisons and whatnot; it clouded their ability to see this guy as his own person.\n\nEdit: and don\u2019t let his family ever guilt you. When MIL guilt trips you by saying things like \u201coh but he\u2019d want me to be more involved!\u201d No, I\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t want his mom to make you feel guilty.", "NTA, you're the mom, and you are the one who can make this call. Your MIL should ideally form a connection with your daughter before any sort of unsupervised (by you) time with her. Of course you want to know your child is comfortable. It's also so wrong that your MIL would use your deceased fiance against you like that. I'm sorry that you're going through this.", "NTA\n\nTrust you gut!\n\nAlso, who goes from not having watched a baby for 5 minutes to an overnight stay!\n\nYou do what you are comfortable with. You don\u2019t owe you MIL anything. She is lucky you allow her in your life.", "NTA. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss and what you\u2019re going through. You absolutely do NOT have to put up with that shit from your MIL. This is YOUR child. I trust my own mom emphatically and my daughters haven\u2019t even had an overnight stay at her house yet and they are 4 and 2. That is an outrageous request on her part. You don\u2019t have to do a damn thing you aren\u2019t comfortable with.", "NTA Your daughter probably reminds your MIL of her son. She could probably use some grief counseling, but I don\u2019t know that it would be helpful for you to be the one to bring that up to her.\n\nYou are going through your own grief as well. You are breastfeeding and it just isn\u2019t viable to do overnight stays while still breastfeeding. It also may not be safe at this stage of grief. If she ain\u2019t willing to compromise with the visits to you and she is lashing out, I think it\u2019s best to limit contact with her for the sake of your baby and yourself until everyone is in a better place.", "NTA: Your late fianc\u00e9 seemed to rarely make contact with his mother, and this controlling behavior could be the reason why they weren\u2019t close. Even parenting plans take into consideration the ages of the children, and if one\u2019s a baby being breastfed. You certainly aren\u2019t going to let a one month old baby, who\u2019s still nursing around the clock, go off for a weekend stay at grandma\u2019s. It only makes sense, that there be a boundary here. MIL needs to also earn your trust gradually. Her pushy, domineering behavior isn\u2019t helping to earn that trust. Overnight stays should be after the baby has started on solids, and you\u2019ve built up enough trust in MIL, to feel confident she isn\u2019t going to kidnap your daughter, or do something else against your wishes.", "Nta, I am sorry your mil is weaponizing the death of your fiance to manipulate you. I would tell her that you understand she wants to babysit. However you are not there yet and her reacting negatively to it is only going to push you away. That you want her involved in your baby life. However you need it to be on your comfortability and your child. \n\nFigure out when you think you would be comfortable with a possible babysitting m. For me it was when I was done breastfeeding at a year. However still no overnight. I would prefer talking before that happens.", "NTA\n\nTrust your instincts. You are in charge and get your parents more involved (around when she is) so she can't bully and guilt you.\n\nEdited: corrected auto correct (spelling)", "NTA - It\u2019s your daughter and it is your choice to decide what is safe for her, especially if she is frequently making her cry.\n\nIf she makes your daughter cry frequently I would consider not letting your fianc\u00e9s mother be around your daughter at all.", "NTA. They're grieving, and grasping at straws. They are trying to override you as the parent -  but it's your call. Not theirs.\n\n>if my fianc\u00e9 was here he would let her watch out daughter every day.\n\nYeah, no. I'd push back on that.\n\n*No, if he were here, he'd be too busy cooing over her to have  any body but her parents take over the parenting.*", "NTA. You and your baby have those feelings for a reason, trust them.", "NTA\n\nI don't really understand any of this situation, I think the best solution is both of you bonding with your daughter together but once a week is plenty of time.

Maybe when the baby is older you will feel more confident. Always trust your instincts. You are the sole parent of this child and your child is dependent on you to make the best decisions possible. There will always be people who try to get you to do things that make you uncomfortable, you have to be able to push back. Your choices will determine the life your child has.

Not every states has them if you are in the US.\nCan you have a family member or friend at your place to support you when the MIL visits?

You do what you are comfortable with. \n\nThis is a tough situation because there\u2019s so much unresolved grief. Would your MIL be acting like this if your fianc\u00e9 were alive? Maybe, but maybe not.  It sounds like your MIL is trying desperately to be closer to her son, through your daughter and doesn\u2019t know how to manage it.  Grief does weird things to people, as I\u2019m sure you know.  You need to respect the fact she lost a child, but she also needs to respect the fact you lost your fianc\u00e9. On top of that you\u2019re a new mom, which is a crazy time all on its own.  If her attitude and antics continue, is there another family member on that side you could reach out to for support? Having someone understand what\u2019s going on, who is farther away from the loss might be beneficial.  Especially if you need someone who she will actually listen to, to talk some sense into her.  I hope it doesn\u2019t get more tense as time goes on. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but congrats on your new little girl.", "I actually am planning on meeting with a lawyer to discuss potential Grandparents Rights and what could possibly happen if she decided to take me to court. I have so much anxiety about her trying to get court ordered time with my daughter I lose sleep about it. That is part of why I have continued to let her come over at least once a week, so if she tries to take me to court I can show that I am not keeping her away or trying to prevent a relationship.", "I do think part of why she struggles with my daughter is because she doesn\u2019t want to actually process her grief. I have been in therapy weekly since less than a month after everything happened and it has helped me immensely with processing everything and trying to balance my deep pain with the happiness my daughter brings me. \n\nI appreciate your comments about the friend you know. Something I want to make sure I do throughout her life is talk about her dad and my memories with him but not constantly compare them. She will always be an amazing miracle and piece of him I get to live with forever but she is her own person and deserves to have the chance to be who she wants to be.

I had so many future plans \u2014 even I didn\u2019t know that I had them. \n\nI suppose at least for me, I had so many grandmas around me, and I longed for a grand baby myself. I watched these new grandmas and without recognizing it, I made plans. \n\nWhen I started voicing those plans I found out the parents had no intention of allowing me to do any of them. \n\nI agree now most of them weren\u2019t possible. \n\nMy daughter pumped so yes I could have taken the baby overnight. (That wasn\u2019t one of my plans. But if it had been, I would have stayed at their house.)\n\nEach of us comes with preconceived notions about how a new baby will change our lives. Lol. It\u2019s usually the other way around: the baby dictates these changes. \n\nI\u2019m sure the death of dad makes these transitions even harder. \n\nBoundaries must be set with grandma hopefully in a gentle way AND accepted gracefully by grandma. \n\nIt\u2019s a trying time. Doing it while grieving must be hard as hell. \n\nI wish both of you compassion and strength. Each of you have suffered a great loss. Hopefully the newest member of your family can use your grief to create a great relationship in the future.", "NAH People have different family bonding habits.  For some people it is normal to look after family members children practically from the get go and other people are more reserved and want to limit family time.  I wonder why you say don't trust though.  You've given no reason why she can't be trusted to be alone with her granddaughter and people have a tendency to trust their birth family members more because they know them better so I think you should examine yourself to see if she has a point and that if your fiance was alive you would feel you had to be more equal out of respect for him", "NTA she\u2019s your daughter, she\u2019s still very young and only you know what is best for her.

This gives me super creepy/baby stealing vibes. Do not leave her alone with this baby.", "NTA.  I'm thinking that unsupervised visits with her may not be a great idea.  She seems to be pushing a little too hard to have that baby by herself.  She may not have worked through her grief.  I wouldn't cut her off but I would  NOT leave my child with her.", "If your late fiance only saw his mother once a month, one could argue for no more frequent visiting than that. \n\nHave a look at the resources over on r/JUSTNOMIL \\- it will give you ideas of what to discuss with your lawyer. What if you get a new job - can you move away? If you meet and marry some time in the future? If she tries to alienate your child from you? \n\nUntil your child is on solids, no overnights away. Anyway, the baby should be sleeping in your room till at least 6 months old acc to most childcare advice\n\nNTA", "I may be reaching a bit here, but I'd be careful around your daughter's grandparents now. Obviously they're still grieving their son, as you are, but the shift in suddenly wanting to watch her and keep her longer than they've ever cared before is, to me, a reaaally red flag. Ever heard stories about MILs and FILs/parents wanting to replace the dead child they've lost with their spouse's? Yeah, that's real. And while I'm not saying this is what will happen here, if I were you I'd still pay great attention to their behaviors. NTA.", "NTA.

Its she who should be making the effort and concessions, not you.", "Nta - If you are concerned that she might go after grandparents rights, then you should probably make plans to leave the area.

Your mother-in-law is so awkward with your child that all the poor baby does is scream around her, and you are breastfeeding a child so young she requires to be fed every 4 hours. This is a child who does not need to be away from her mommy overnight, let alone for an entire week. Your mother-in-law's request is completely unreasonable. If This were a television movie, I would be suspecting your mother-in-law of planning to run away with your baby to try and replace her lost son. But that might be my sleep deprived paranoia speaking.", "I wouldn't stress about it too much in the short term.  No judge would order you to send a baby away with a grandparent when you are allowing access to her and you are exclusively breastfeeding."]}
