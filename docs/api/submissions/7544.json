That is brutal. But it\u2019s amazing that a piece of him gets to live on in your daughter. Have your in-laws properly grieved? Now this is *all** speculation so really, take this with a grain of salt, but that may be part of the reason MIL struggles with you daughter. She is a living, breathing, piece of her son. When she looks at her, she sees both a miracle and a tragedy at the same time.\n\nI think it\u2019s admirable that you want your daughter to get to know her father through his family. I don\u2019t necessarily think you should give that up. But that all happens on *your* terms, so it\u2019s okay for you to maintain strict boundaries.

Grief does weird things to people, as I\u2019m sure you know.  You need to respect the fact she lost a child, but she also needs to respect the fact you lost your fianc\u00e9.

It's not just your comfort level since your daughter is exclusively breast fed.", "NTA. My son is nearly 4mo old and I have no intention of leaving him with anyone other than my DH for a while. Your mil is being too pushy for comfort. There's no reason for a baby to be left in someone else's care for any amount of time if you're not comfortable with it. \n\nAlso, where I'm from, it's recommended a child should be away from their primary caregiver for more than a night per year of age.", "NTA", "op=NTA\n\nbut your MIL may have some serious grief issues to resolve. \n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 only visited her once a month for breakfast--I'm guessing her statement that he'd let her watch your daughter every day is not a real thing, but her projecting to get her way.\n\nI would NOT allow her unsupervised visits(and no overnights) until you are sure that her mental health is in the right place.  \n\nAlso look up Grandparent's rights in your location, so that you do not give her the opportunity to claim them while her behavior is still worrisome.\n\nPlease take care of yourself and your baby.  And make sure that you have a will with guardianship set up in case something happens to you.", "I get what your saying, I think from my perspective I don\u2019t trust her because of the way she interacts with my daughter when she visits. My daughter isn\u2019t the easiest of babies (fights sleeping, cries a lot) and when my MIL is over and my daughter cries she doesn\u2019t handle it well. I have tried to not hover when she is visiting to give her space to bond but she isn\u2019t good at trying to soothe her. I will try to make respectful comments such as \u201cshe likes to be held xyz\u201d and my MIL will follow that up with \u201cbut then I can\u2019t see her face and take pictures.\u201d She has also never changed her diaper in the 4 months my daughter has been alive, even when I have told her she can she will give my daughter back to me when she needs a diaper change. \nMy MIL has also told me that she can\u2019t handle noise and needs silence or she feels overwhelmed and has to walk away. That makes me hesitant because like I mentioned my baby cries a lot and will just need a different activity or to be held differently and then she will stop. So I get nervous that my babies needs won\u2019t be met if she is alone with my MIL", ">If you get to the point of trusting her, I'd suggest she do an overnight with you where she takes care of the baby, but it's in your home and you are there in a pinch.    \n>  \n>I definitely would not allow alone time with someone who has not changed a single diaper and claims she can't handle the noise.  Of a crying baby? Yeah that's gonna happen.  Babies cry--that' how they communicate."]}
