She can give it to her kid and leave the night cream out. The rest of the stuff sounds like it\u2019d be fun for teens and she probably (hopefully) won\u2019t get carried away with it.", "Sunscreen is very important to skin health. Fuck beauty standards, I'm talking long-term skin cancer prevention. NTA, it's not like you got her make-up or botox.", "I wish I had started at that age. I really do.", "NTA, skincare products are just cleanser and moisturiser - night cream is a moisturiser with a slightly different formula than day cream. The purpose is to keep the skin clean and toned and moisturised. Not all skincare routines are based on anti-ageing and sunscreen is essential for everyone. \n\nIt's not a bad idea for you and your sister to talk to 13yo about your different views of skincare, because it is important to encourage teenagers to avoid the pressure of false beauty standards.", "NTA. \n\nSunscreen and moisturiser are basic items for looking after yourself at any age. In Australia, most classrooms have sunscreen to put on during the day and are heavily recommended regardless of age.  \n\nI would have ensured the night cream/serum didn't have any harsh actives (a lot have retinol) or mention anything to do with aging/anti-wrinkle and gone with something she could you night and day to start with. Other than that, and maybe adding a gentle cleanser, these aren't out unusual for teens to want or need. \n\nIt's possible that this was maybe something your sister wanted to do with your niece as a mother/daughter experience though, and maybe she didn't want to express her upset towards that?", "THIRTEEN IS TOO YOUNG FOR SUNSCREEN???? Does your sister like the idea of skin cancer????????????\n\nNTA", "Oh for crying out loud. NTA. Your sister overreacted to an innocently and good naturedly given gift. You weren\u2019t shaming her into using age defying products. And night cream isn\u2019t poison people. It\u2019s moisturizer. If there are any ingredients in it that she\u2019s sensitive too then her mom can remove it from the basket and take it for herself after saying \u201cthank you for such a thoughtful gift. We will definitely have fun with the mask\u201d.

I actually laughed after reading this and thought, really?!?!", "NTA it\u2019s not about aging or beauty. I don\u2019t care about getting old. But my skin would have been less troublesome and scarred had I been taking care of it. But I had no clue. I didn\u2019t wear sunscreen or use moisturizer until I was in my late 20s. In my high school and college years, I was stripping my skin dry with Noxema pads even though I didn\u2019t have breakouts because I thought that was how to avoid acne. My whole face would be itching from the dryness and I was congratulating myself for getting rid of the oil. People don\u2019t realize that they do need to take care of skin just like we take care of our hair and trim our nails.  I think it\u2019s more of an American thing that we think of it as an anti-aging issue rather than hygiene or self care.", "NAH, but as someone who has received skincare products from her aunt for years? It gets old fast. Don\u2019t make it a habit.", "Nta. Sounds like you're encouraging good hygiene. I would imagine that \"beauty standards\" would be makeup and other trends.", "Definitely NTA\nGood skin care should be something you try to instill at a young age so it\u2019s not such a hard habit to make later in life. It\u2019d be different if you did it and told her that how badly she needed it to stay young but you didn\u2019t. Not to mention she\u2019s 13 and is ab to get acne it would be super beneficial for her to get a jump on skin care to help with that. Helps her build healthy habits and keeps her from potentially getting bullied over acne. I see no issue, NTA.", "NTA. I was going NAH until I got to the bit about your sister objecting to sunscreen. Skin cancer doesn't care how young you are.", "NTA. If mom feels this strongly she can tell her daughter to not use them or take them away. It was a gift (I think a cute/nice/harmless one) and the family is free to decide what to do with it", "NTA, but just to give you some feedback, when I was that age I had horrible acne. It was purely hormonal and no skin care routine would ever have been able to improve it. Even dermatologist prescribed stuff failed, aside from oral medication.\n\nAnyways, during that time well meaning aunts would always give me skin care items and gift certificates for facials etc. It really made me feel self conscious about my skin. And it felt like they thought that my looks were the most important thing about me.", "Nta", "Sun screen is for all ages!\n\nThis isn\u2019t beauty standards just healthy skin\n\nI will say habits are EVERYTHING.

I live where winter is fast approaching. Moisturizers of all kinds are helpful in combating the inevitable skin dryness and eczema that accompany the cold winter weather.", "NAH - The sunscreen was a good gift, the other stuff was a little insensitive, but I think your sister overreacted, a bit, too.", "NTA,  and sunshine reen, yeah my dad is constantly getting it cut out of his face, so that's important.   It's skincare not make up.  It's important to take care of your skin at every age.  Especially your face. Your sister sound stop trying to put her insecurities on you and her daughter.", "ESH - her daughter definitely needs sunscreen, it's literally to prevent skin cancer. She doesn't need night cream or serum, that's for women aged 25 and up and even then some women don't want to wear it.", "The serum might be a bit much and the night cream is something that could have been left out, but really isn't a big deal. In general it's a fun little gift and stuff like sunscreen is really important. NTA", "YTA\n\nFor multiple reasons. First, you don't know what are in those packages -- they could irritate her skin, break her out, etc.\n\nA 13 year old does not need night cream. And why are you encouraging her to think beauty is important?\n\nThis is stuff you ask a parent about before giving it to their kid.", "Yes, YTA.  You don\u2019t give teenagers skincare products without consulting their parents for any number of reasons.

I only use it at the beach/pool in the summer\u2026.", "Nta, shes going thru, or at least about to go thru puberty, this is when they teach kids to start taking care of their bodies and start washing their faces and taking care of their skin more often because of sweating, acne, and other puberty changes. Its good to have a routine and even better to start young. If skincare wasn't important dermatologists wouldn't have jobs. And pls teach her to use sunscreen all over her body, I'm almost 30 and always forget to do everything else besides my face \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. I REALLY WISH I had some family and friends who knew better how to care for skin during puberty. I ruined my face from allowing others to pop my zits. I have to so many deep scars on my checks.

Since before I could even remember, not just when at the beach, but whenever I went outside. Australians might have more need for sunscreen than some other places, but the rest of the world (excluding places like NZ with similar sun protection views, ofc) should take notes. It\u2019s not about vanity, it\u2019s about skin cancer, sun poisoning, sun burn, etc. You don\u2019t need to fear aging if you\u2019re not going to take steps to prevent dying before you get the change to see wrinkles. (I know, a bit dramatic, but  oh well.)\n\nAlso, face masks might not be needed, but they\u2019re a fun self care activity. I used to do face masks every so often with my mum and sister, especially the day before holidays like xmas and easter. It was a fun bonding experience.", "test", "NTA skin cancer and healthy skin doesn\u2019t care how old you are", "sunscreen is not a fun hobby though? Shouldn't everyone put on sunscreen?", "This is the correct answer!", "But it's like buying TP or deodorant  - sunscreen isn't a treat item suitable for a birthday present.

Skincare isn\u2019t about beauty for everyone. For some it\u2019s a calming self-care routine that helps us feel like we\u2019re taking care of ourselves. \n\n3. No age is too young to start skincare. In some cultures like in Asia, we\u2019re taught the importance of sunscreen and keeping our faces moisturized all the time from a young age.

Night cream is just fancy moisturizer, it\u2019s no biggie", "Also I did not see the last comment but it is for her birthday, she has not actually received the present yet, so I gave it to my sister so she could give it to her daughter.

It's not related to beauty standards. \nFwiw when I was a tween/teen me and my friends loved face masks and cutesy packaging, painting nails, etc. We'd do stuff like at each other's houses during sleepovers. It's not as ominous as you think.", "For everything else that is a topic of debate, but as for the irritation, I have extremely sensitive skin, and I go to that store all the time and tested out each one on my own skin. I figured since my skin is very prone to irritation and we are related, what would not irritate me would not irritate her. \nI\u2019ve tried the face masks before and they do not irritate me either.", "Night cream is for everyone especially during winter, too dry skin is painful. Suncream is to avoid skin cancer.", "Just curious, then, what is an appropriate gift for a teenager, that a parent doesn't need to vet? A running joke in my family was gifting toothbrushes and toothpaste, should we not encourage dental care either (genuinely, why don't you think skincare is important? Is it not just part of general hygiene?)\n\nETA: After reading more comments I say NAH. sure, a parent will likely know best what their young teens skincare needs are (and hopefully in an age appropriate way) but it sounds like OP was just buying a cute looking set with no ill intent/subliminal messaging about beauty standards intended.

Beauty/nighttime skincare routines are in right now and I\u2019ve been seeing kids younger and younger putting all sorts of crap on their face. A routine with a couple of items is one thing but I have seen videos on social media of kids as young as 10 and 11 putting 15 to 20 things on their face from oils to anti-aging serums. It\u2019s becoming an exploitative market towards kids of a certain age. Young kids thinking a list of products is necessary to feel beautiful and have \u201cflawless\u201d skin. So, I can understand why mom would be a bit uncomfortable with the idea. Yes, it may only be a few small items,some of which are necessary like the sunscreen, but I also get a parent\u2019s fear and worrying about the worse possible scenario in this situation.

Serums and mists and masks are not.", "Washing your face is skin hygiene.  Using a full-blown skincare routine is not.

I know I personally would want to vet those products to make sure they are age-appropriate and do not contain exfoliants or retinols, which a 13 year old does not yet need. \n\nMoreover, I would not gift a teenager skincare without asking her parents because it may be something her mother wants to share with her.  My mother looked forward to teaching me how to apply lip gloss, then cold cream, then blush, etc, as I got older.  \n\nThere are many other appropriate gifts to give a 13 year old.

Good for you if you enjoy other things, but respectfully, most 13 year old girls would enjoy this a present.\n\nNevermind that whether or not it\u2019s fun wasn\u2019t actually the point, it\u2019s that the gifts in themselves aren\u2019t harmful and don\u2019t do what the sister claimed they would.", "Oh that does sound extreme wtf", "INFO \n\nDid your niece want a skin care routine for her birthday? \n\nI mean it is good to get in the habit of maintaining your skin health but if that\u2019s not something she\u2019s interested in I can see why your sister got huffy", "NAH - it's a sweet gesture but if your niece did not express any interest in this stuff it could seem like you are pressuring her to perform beauty, or making a comment on her appearance. Teenagers are really vulnerable and insecure, especially girls.\n\nThe beauty industry is a billion dollar industry relying on exploitation of people insecurities, and I can see why your sister wants to protect her daughter from that as long as possible, and let her just enjoy being a kid.\n\nYes sunscreen is important - but lots of skincare is unnecessary and expensive, and elaborate skincare routines are marketing hype.", "I'll say NAH to an extent. It feels like a very gendered gift - girls getting feminine products at a certain age vs boys getting cool books or toys. At school we used to do Christmas gift exchanges and it suckled when I'd get a candle or perfume because I'm AFAB. It's different if your niece has expressed interest in skincare, though that's usually not what 13 year olds are thinking of.\n\n\nIn regards to sunscreen - the focus of sunscreen should never be \"it prevents aging\", that's extremely harmful for their future mental health. The focus should be on preventing cancer.", "I know how OP and her sister feels about it but how does the niece feel? Did she ever show any interest in beauty care products? That's important info in deciding if OP was an AH.", "My son has a dry skin and I've been putting lotions on him and trying new creams with him since forever. I don't think a sunscreen is \"putting on pressure\". I also don't think skincare is purely a \"beauty\" thing. \n\nIf this is something your niece might be interested in, then this is an ok gift to give. Maybe the night cream and clenser are not needed at 13 but I don't think it's something to get mad over.\n\nThe only thing I guess might have upset the mom is if you're niece has already felt some pressure to look a sertain way and your gift had her bringing it up again with the mom.\n\nI'm gonna say NAH.

But sun screen? That's not anti-aging that's anti cancer. My mom didn't wear sunscreen when she was young cuz it was nothing and she has had to have at least 10 spots removed from her face and back. And each time it's scary because we don't know how deep it's going to go. I know a woman slightly older than my mother who practically has no nose left because of all the skin cancer they've had to remove from it. And you know what else helps against skin cancer besides sunscreen? Healthy moisturized skin.", "NAH I\u2019ve done similar but only animal face masks and forcing sunscreen on my nieces. My sister was fine with both because one was cute and one stops skin cancer. I actually agree with your sis that night cream is too much at her age because her skin simply does not need it and too many chemicals are bad for young skin. I totally get your intentions but your sister also has a point on the night cream. That all said, sunscreen is not a beauty product. Every single person on this planet should be putting some form on everyday. Skin cancer does not discriminate in any way and it is a big deal.", "Info, is your niece interested in skin care or just beauty and make up? Because if she is it\u2019s a fun gift, if she very clearly isn\u2019t it\u2019s an insult", "NAH, did your niece ever express that she wanted this though? Because if someone got me skincare without me asking for it I'd definitely take it as a comment on my skin/acne, which isn't what a 13 year old (or anyone) needs for their birthday.", "NTA, I wish I had an aunt who did this for me. When I was thirteen, I had awful skin because I had no idea what to do for skin care and that would have given me a nudge in the right direction.", "NAH.\n\nI get where your sister is coming from. Especially since a lot of K beauty products have skin whiteners. And there\u2019s enormous cultural pressure in Asia to be beautiful and often get plastic surgery. Even if this stuff is cute and girly, a lot of the brands have packaging focusing on being beautiful and youthful etc. \n\nBut moisturizer and sunscreen and some fun face masks are fun but also good for health. \n\nIdk. I would acknowledge your sister\u2019s concern, and talk to the 13 year old about your intentions. Let her know that you wanted it to be a fun sleepover kind of thing and that sunscreen is very important, but it\u2019s okay to not get too over invested in products. Women\u2019s insecurities are so commercialized that I think your sister is coming from a good place to be protective.", "My personal opinion is 13 is too young for night cream or serums.

Establishing a good skin care routine is good just for skin not for crazy beauty standards. Make no mistake, there are crazy pressures put on people to obtain crazy beauty standards but having a skin care routine to take care of your skin is not one of them.

There was maybe 1 or 2 microscopic little tiny bumps, you could barely see them. And i told her multiple times how dangerous her habits can be. She is just getting into puberty, her skin is gonna do weird things, and hats normal. The important things are washing your face daily and putting a simple lotion on right after. Thats it. And if theres anything concerning happening then we can always see a dermatologist (we dont live in the us) and then get professional help. Now for the last month or so, she has stopped all those weird serums and cleansers and stuff and just sticks to the basics that i told her. And aside from the occassional small pimple she gets, her skin is perfectly fine. Those skin care routines are usually for people who are getting into their 30s/40s.
