She said that the animal masks and cute bottles are fun but the inclusion of night cream and sunscreen could make her daughter already feel pressure not to age at 13.\n\nI see it as a fun way of ensuring good skin habits at an early age, considering most start their routines way too young, and I see it as a cute girly gift that she might enjoy, but my sister says 13 years old is too young and she shouldn\u2019t be worrying about aging. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697170981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176qbfz/aita_for_giving_skincare_to_my_13_year_old_niece/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can give it to her kid and leave the night cream out. The rest of the stuff sounds like it\u2019d be fun for teens and she probably (hopefully) won\u2019t get carried away with it.", "Sunscreen is very important to skin health. Fuck beauty standards, I'm talking long-term skin cancer prevention. NTA, it's not like you got her make-up or botox.", "I wish I had started at that age. I really do.", "NTA, skincare products are just cleanser and moisturiser - night cream is a moisturiser with a slightly different formula than day cream. The purpose is to keep the skin clean and toned and moisturised. Not all skincare routines are based on anti-ageing and sunscreen is essential for everyone. \n\nIt's not a bad idea for you and your sister to talk to 13yo about your different views of skincare, because it is important to encourage teenagers to avoid the pressure of false beauty standards.", "NTA. \n\nSunscreen and moisturiser are basic items for looking after yourself at any age. In Australia, most classrooms have sunscreen to put on during the day and are heavily recommended regardless of age.  \n\nI would have ensured the night cream/serum didn't have any harsh actives (a lot have retinol) or mention anything to do with aging/anti-wrinkle and gone with something she could you night and day to start with. Other than that, and maybe adding a gentle cleanser, these aren't out unusual for teens to want or need. \n\nIt's possible that this was maybe something your sister wanted to do with your niece as a mother/daughter experience though, and maybe she didn't want to express her upset towards that?", "THIRTEEN IS TOO YOUNG FOR SUNSCREEN???? Does your sister like the idea of skin cancer????????????\n\nNTA", "Oh for crying out loud. NTA. Your sister overreacted to an innocently and good naturedly given gift. You weren\u2019t shaming her into using age defying products. And night cream isn\u2019t poison people. It\u2019s moisturizer. If there are any ingredients in it that she\u2019s sensitive too then her mom can remove it from the basket and take it for herself after saying \u201cthank you for such a thoughtful gift. We will definitely have fun with the mask\u201d. Also, at 13 she probably doesn\u2019t even know everything she may be allergic to and the only way to find out is to have an allergic reaction to something. I actually laughed after reading this and thought, really?!?!", "NTA it\u2019s not about aging or beauty. I don\u2019t care about getting old. But my skin would have been less troublesome and scarred had I been taking care of it. But I had no clue. I didn\u2019t wear sunscreen or use moisturizer until I was in my late 20s. In my high school and college years, I was stripping my skin dry with Noxema pads even though I didn\u2019t have breakouts because I thought that was how to avoid acne. My whole face would be itching from the dryness and I was congratulating myself for getting rid of the oil. People don\u2019t realize that they do need to take care of skin just like we take care of our hair and trim our nails.  I think it\u2019s more of an American thing that we think of it as an anti-aging issue rather than hygiene or self care.", "NAH, but as someone who has received skincare products from her aunt for years? It gets old fast. Don\u2019t make it a habit.", "Nta. Sounds like you're encouraging good hygiene. I would imagine that \"beauty standards\" would be makeup and other trends.", "Definitely NTA\nGood skin care should be something you try to instill at a young age so it\u2019s not such a hard habit to make later in life. It\u2019d be different if you did it and told her that how badly she needed it to stay young but you didn\u2019t. Not to mention she\u2019s 13 and is ab to get acne it would be super beneficial for her to get a jump on skin care to help with that. Helps her build healthy habits and keeps her from potentially getting bullied over acne. I see no issue, NTA.", "NTA. I was going NAH until I got to the bit about your sister objecting to sunscreen. Skin cancer doesn't care how young you are.", "NTA. If mom feels this strongly she can tell her daughter to not use them or take them away. It was a gift (I think a cute/nice/harmless one) and the family is free to decide what to do with it", "NTA, but just to give you some feedback, when I was that age I had horrible acne. It was purely hormonal and no skin care routine would ever have been able to improve it. Even dermatologist prescribed stuff failed, aside from oral medication.\n\nAnyways, during that time well meaning aunts would always give me skin care items and gift certificates for facials etc. It really made me feel self conscious about my skin. And it felt like they thought that my looks were the most important thing about me.", "Nta", "Sun screen is for all ages!\n\nThis isn\u2019t beauty standards just healthy skin\n\nI will say habits are EVERYTHING.  If you don\u2019t start young harder to learn.  Talk about what\u2019s healthy vs not, but a little care now can go long away without entering into unhealthy territory", "NTA.\n\nIt's fun as a teen to try different products. I live where winter is fast approaching. Moisturizers of all kinds are helpful in combating the inevitable skin dryness and eczema that accompany the cold winter weather.", "NAH - The sunscreen was a good gift, the other stuff was a little insensitive, but I think your sister overreacted, a bit, too.", "NTA,  and sunshine reen, yeah my dad is constantly getting it cut out of his face, so that's important.   It's skincare not make up.  It's important to take care of your skin at every age.  Especially your face. Your sister sound stop trying to put her insecurities on you and her daughter.", "ESH - her daughter definitely needs sunscreen, it's literally to prevent skin cancer. She doesn't need night cream or serum, that's for women aged 25 and up and even then some women don't want to wear it.", "The serum might be a bit much and the night cream is something that could have been left out, but really isn't a big deal. In general it's a fun little gift and stuff like sunscreen is really important. NTA", "YTA\n\nFor multiple reasons. First, you don't know what are in those packages -- they could irritate her skin, break her out, etc.\n\nA 13 year old does not need night cream. And why are you encouraging her to think beauty is important?\n\nThis is stuff you ask a parent about before giving it to their kid.", "Yes, YTA.  You don\u2019t give teenagers skincare products without consulting their parents for any number of reasons.  Her mother may not want her using a night cream, she may want to vet the ingredients, or she may not want to encourage her daughter to begin skincare at this age.  \n\nHow do you not see how incredibly invasive and out of line this is?", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was also a one time treat, not a monthly subscription. I\u2019m curious until what age of your niece is your sis going to stop being hyper controlling? I have a good feeling it won\u2019t happen until your niece is older and has to stand up to her mom (at which point she will be very resentful to her). I say this because if she\u2019s like this with skincare, I can only imagine how she is with everyone else", "NTA, my daughter has an array of stuff - beauty things - age appropriate - sunscreen, sunscreen, bout 3 different types of sunscreen, tinted sunscreen, moisturiser (natural), more sunscreen, makeup removal stuff (she likes to play with eyeshadow lipsticks and blush) etc etc.", "NTA. Skin care isn't about beauty, it's about a healthy skin. It's good to teach her how to take care of her skin. But that wasn't even your intention. Maybe your sister reacted like this because she wanted to be the one to come up with that idea and do it with her daughter?", "I do see your sister's point and I don't think she's entirely wrong, but wearing sunscreen is not (just) about aging, it's about not getting skin cancer, wtf lady. She's at the age where she's probably getting acne (if it's not already in full swing) so a cleanser and moisturizer are a great idea.\n\nIf your niece wanted these things and is interested in skincare, then NTA, with your sister being the asshole for not already having her daughter wearing sunscreen every day. If she expressed no interest before this and your sole motivation was getting her into a \"routine\" that she may not want or need, then ESH because your sister is right and you don't need to be giving this kind of non-gift to a child who's not interested.", "NTA-not sure what your sister is on but it's not \"beauty standards\" it's just fun/important skin care, especially cleanser and sunscreen \n\nand at 13, that's when she'll need it and when it starts. and sunscreen in general, no matter your age is just essential. aging is not what it's for. Skin Cancer doesn't give a fuck about beauty standards.", "Ummm kids should be wearing sunscreen in the first place.... And adults...", "NTA\u2026.but should I be wearing sunscreen on my face every day? I only use it at the beach/pool in the summer\u2026.", "Nta, shes going thru, or at least about to go thru puberty, this is when they teach kids to start taking care of their bodies and start washing their faces and taking care of their skin more often because of sweating, acne, and other puberty changes. Its good to have a routine and even better to start young. If skincare wasn't important dermatologists wouldn't have jobs. And pls teach her to use sunscreen all over her body, I'm almost 30 and always forget to do everything else besides my face \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. I REALLY WISH I had some family and friends who knew better how to care for skin during puberty. I ruined my face from allowing others to pop my zits. I have to so many deep scars on my checks. It\u2019s almost (but not there with) Tommy Lee Jones lol.", "NTA.\n\nSunscreen should be always used, different protection depending on the season but always. Before people come at me with \u201cbefore nobody use it\u201d go asking elders how many of them are undergoing skin cancer treatment.\n\nNight cream to hydrate the skin is just useful, especially if it is cold during the winter.\n\nIt is not beauty standards is healthcare.\n\nOnly beauty standards stuff were the mask, but they were animals and it will be fun to do that with friends.", "Facial wash, moisturiser, and sunscreen, aren\u2019t about beauty standards, they\u2019re about skin health. 13 is the perfect age to start washing your face and moisturising as that\u2019s when you actually start to need these things, if it was retinol or makeup, that would be understandable, but the things you got her are perfectly normal. \n\nAs an Australian, I grew up using sunscreen. Since before I could even remember, not just when at the beach, but whenever I went outside. Australians might have more need for sunscreen than some other places, but the rest of the world (excluding places like NZ with similar sun protection views, ofc) should take notes. It\u2019s not about vanity, it\u2019s about skin cancer, sun poisoning, sun burn, etc. You don\u2019t need to fear aging if you\u2019re not going to take steps to prevent dying before you get the change to see wrinkles. (I know, a bit dramatic, but  oh well.)\n\nAlso, face masks might not be needed, but they\u2019re a fun self care activity. I used to do face masks every so often with my mum and sister, especially the day before holidays like xmas and easter. It was a fun bonding experience.", "test", "NTA skin cancer and healthy skin doesn\u2019t care how old you are", "sunscreen is not a fun hobby though? Shouldn't everyone put on sunscreen?", "This is the correct answer!", "But it's like buying TP or deodorant  - sunscreen isn't a treat item suitable for a birthday present.  The serums and stuff are makeup-adjacent.", "Agreed, it doesn't sound like she got anything that couldn't just be considered a fun introduction to taking care of her skin (which isn't just about anti ageing). Sunscreen and cleanser being the top two, I started getting spots aged 11 and the only thing that cleared my skin up was starting to use cleanser and learning about ingredients like tea tree oil and witch hazel.", "Yeah the things she listed don't sounds like \"beauty standards\" more just general skincare. \n\nLooking after your skin is an important part of life, just like keeping active and eating sensibly etc.", "Her parents can instill those values in her if they believe them to be important.", "1. She has a choice not to use it. As someone with an ass load of allergies, if someone gives me food I always have the choice to appreciate the thought, but not eat it if I\u2019m not sure about the ingredients. \n\n2. Skincare isn\u2019t about beauty for everyone. For some it\u2019s a calming self-care routine that helps us feel like we\u2019re taking care of ourselves. \n\n3. No age is too young to start skincare. In some cultures like in Asia, we\u2019re taught the importance of sunscreen and keeping our faces moisturized all the time from a young age. Even though I immigrated at a very young age, my parents still told me this. \n\n4. Night cream is just fancy moisturizer, it\u2019s no biggie", "Also I did not see the last comment but it is for her birthday, she has not actually received the present yet, so I gave it to my sister so she could give it to her daughter. She is not going to give it to her. So I technically did consult with my sister?", "Night cream is literally just thick moisturizer.\n\nShe can patch test on her jaw or her neck like the rest of us do. How else would she learn what she can use?", "At 13 I def needed face cream", "Sunscreen is a necessity, everyone should use it. Infants included. It's not related to beauty standards. \nFwiw when I was a tween/teen me and my friends loved face masks and cutesy packaging, painting nails, etc. We'd do stuff like at each other's houses during sleepovers. It's not as ominous as you think.", "For everything else that is a topic of debate, but as for the irritation, I have extremely sensitive skin, and I go to that store all the time and tested out each one on my own skin. I figured since my skin is very prone to irritation and we are related, what would not irritate me would not irritate her. \nI\u2019ve tried the face masks before and they do not irritate me either.", "Night cream is for everyone especially during winter, too dry skin is painful. Suncream is to avoid skin cancer.", "Just curious, then, what is an appropriate gift for a teenager, that a parent doesn't need to vet? A running joke in my family was gifting toothbrushes and toothpaste, should we not encourage dental care either (genuinely, why don't you think skincare is important? Is it not just part of general hygiene?)\n\nETA: After reading more comments I say NAH. sure, a parent will likely know best what their young teens skincare needs are (and hopefully in an age appropriate way) but it sounds like OP was just buying a cute looking set with no ill intent/subliminal messaging about beauty standards intended. Mom could have easily and calmly said \"hey, she's still pretty young and some of this stuff isn't quite appropriate yet but we appreciate the thought\"", "Racist", "Skincare and face masks aren't \"fun\" for everyone.  I'd see this present as an utter bore.", "also idk where y\u2019all live but when i was 13+, early winter mornings waiting outside class made my skin painfully dry, to the point of peeling palms. Id have been grateful for moisturizers n creams to keep my skin", "I live in Australia, skin cancer/melanoma is one of the biggest killers here.\n\nEveryone should absolutely be wearing sunscreen everyday, even if it is overcast.\n\nOur skin is our largest organ and we should be taking more care of it than we actually do.", "Skincare should be started when puberty does imo. Taking time for self care is also good for yourself :)", "Well they think suncream is beauty standards when it is just healthcare, good luck with that.", "Skin care is important whether or not her parents think it\u2019s important is irrelevant. Everyone has skin and everyone should take care of it. End of story.", "I understand what you are saying but I also get mom\u2019s concern. Beauty/nighttime skincare routines are in right now and I\u2019ve been seeing kids younger and younger putting all sorts of crap on their face. A routine with a couple of items is one thing but I have seen videos on social media of kids as young as 10 and 11 putting 15 to 20 things on their face from oils to anti-aging serums. It\u2019s becoming an exploitative market towards kids of a certain age. Young kids thinking a list of products is necessary to feel beautiful and have \u201cflawless\u201d skin. So, I can understand why mom would be a bit uncomfortable with the idea. Yes, it may only be a few small items,some of which are necessary like the sunscreen, but I also get a parent\u2019s fear and worrying about the worse possible scenario in this situation. With that being said, I don\u2019t think OP is an AH, but her sister isn\u2019t an asshole regarding the decisions she makes for her kid either.", "I was on the fence but this comment sealed it for me. YTA\n\nAs someone with sensitive skin, you should understand that what might cause your skin to have a reaction, may not cause my skin to. But another product might cause my skin to become severely damaged and painful, that does not do anything to you. \n\nYou overstepped and you know about sensitivities.", "Washing your face is general hygiene. Serums and mists and masks are not.", "Washing your face is skin hygiene.  Using a full-blown skincare routine is not.  Her parents may feel that 13 is too young for her to be using night creams and toners.  I know I personally would want to vet those products to make sure they are age-appropriate and do not contain exfoliants or retinols, which a 13 year old does not yet need. \n\nMoreover, I would not gift a teenager skincare without asking her parents because it may be something her mother wants to share with her.  My mother looked forward to teaching me how to apply lip gloss, then cold cream, then blush, etc, as I got older.  \n\nThere are many other appropriate gifts to give a 13 year old.  Or at least, ask her parents if they are okay with you gifting her a full skincare routine.", "If OP is getting this as a present for her niece, it\u2019s pretty safe to say the child doesn\u2019t feel the same. Good for you if you enjoy other things, but respectfully, most 13 year old girls would enjoy this a present.\n\nNevermind that whether or not it\u2019s fun wasn\u2019t actually the point, it\u2019s that the gifts in themselves aren\u2019t harmful and don\u2019t do what the sister claimed they would.", "Oh that does sound extreme wtf"]}
