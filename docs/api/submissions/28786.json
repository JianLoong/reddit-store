Sounds like he is in more of a relationship with football than you.  I get it, to some people that is their life, but you have to ask yourself that, if this is long term, what else may be skipped.  Will you have to plan a wedding and honeymoon around the football schedule. If you plan on having kids, what happens when their birthday falls on a game day?

You need to ask does it matter if he\u2019s there? If its one of those things where it would be nice but not vital for him to go - compromise and drop the issue. \n\nMy husband had to give his season ticket up when we had our second child and honestly he lost a little big of his spark for a while.

Neither of you can dictate the other like a parent, and I kinda get that vibe from you. Not saying it's *bad*, per se, some people are just a little more naturally parental than others, even with their friends, and as long as they don't let it go to their head, it can even be charming. I think you're taking it a bit too far, though.\n\nBut I think the way you're coming at him is pretty demanding, like \"he has to not go to the game.\" I get that you're upset, but you simply can't control other people and by making demands like that and thinking your word is final, then you're just going to breed resentment. All of the language you're using feels like you're going to use your \"being 'fine' with him going to the games\" as ammunition to get your way here.\n\nYou gotta talk it out with respect.

However, the team I watch plays some games against the AHL affiliate of my favorite NHL team.  My spouse knows those dates are non-negotiable games.  My spouse also is in the same boat where her NHL teams AHL one plays the one in our town.  I swap tickets so we both go together during them.  Basically, I don\u2019t get to see all games and neither does my spouse.  We make compromises.

If you'd moved the dinner time, he would have had to run straight from the game to dinner and it would ruin his fun.\n\nIt'd be interesting to know what he says when you point out the game time was changed months ago.

And if it is true that you make a lot more concessions than him are you sure it's the birthday itself that's the issue, or is it a culmination of all your negative feelings over not being treated the same as you treat him?\n\nRegardless, I don't think you're being overly sensitive. So far I'm going with NAH. It's really just a squabble and a difference in priorities, not the end of the world. He doesn't see why it's any more important than any other birthday, and you feel as though it is.

First, you've gotta separate the actual underlying issue from the current problem. To me it sounds like your real issue is not being prioritized.

How that goes is up to y'all, but I'd recommend talking about how *you* feel, and not how *his actions made* you feel. One is more open and keeps the focus on what's important, how you're feeling, instead of turning it into a blame game.\n\nMaybe I'm just desensitized to these things because of all the genuinely crazy AITA posts, but this really is an issue that can be solved by a small compromise followed by a calm talk about the underlying problems. You shouldn't have to argue about this every time there are conflicting plans, and he shouldn't have to re-justify it every time either. It's an argument, but far from something to nuke your relationship over.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, your mum would probably barely notice that he isn't there, especially with the entire rest of the family around. 50 can be more of a milestone for our families than it is for us.

That is selfish", "And she could\u2019ve changed it if he\u2019d told her about the new kick off time back in August.", "Wondered if I was the only one who thought this.  Moreso he is a boyfriend, not a husband. \"Potential mother in law's birthday\" is a far cry from MIL's birthday in any event and being told I \"had to\" wouldnt sit right with me.\n\nPersonally I would go to the party, but I'm not a football fan so I might not get it.", "Wait you\u2026 don\u2019t think the people in your life are more important than one specific day for your hobby?", "Not sure why this was downvoted because it\u2019s a legitimate question. \n\nAnother example of how \u201cFamily First\u201d is used as \u201cWe\u2019re doing what *I* want because what you want doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d", "\u201cHe agreed\u201d\n\nYou can keep calling me names if it makes you feel good, but it doesn\u2019t make your point any more valid.", "You were correct in that you could lose your season ticket if you don't meet the required attendance level. For Arsenal I need to attend 17/21 games (3 cup matches included). I was just adding context to point out that it's more flexible and not as brutal as it seems. OP isn't as tied to this game as he might seem just because he's got a ticket for instance.\n\nAs for City, long time waiting! First league win in 8 years/12 games and I couldn't attend because of a leg injury...\nOP needs to decide how much it means to his GF and bite the bullet for his own poor judgment. The kick off time has been set for long enough for him to manage this convo sooner. Anyway, Arsenal are winning that game so he won't miss anything!", "Yes those are red flags and reasons she should dump this asshat and find a real man", "proving to your partner of 2 years that you value a sports match over them is a pretty big strike, actually.", "Okay, let me rephrase: if you agree 3 months in advance to attend an event that is important to your girlfriend and then at the last minute, you chose not to go because you want to do something that *you* want to do (that is no way a personal or family emergency), *you are TA.*\n\nThe fact that\u2019s it\u2019s a sports game is irreverent - the only things that *might* make it relevant don\u2019t apply here. It\u2019s not the only game he has tickets too, he\u2019s not going with anyone special (as in, no one\u2019s flying in specifically to see this specific game with him or something), it\u2019s not the world series. I get that it\u2019s important to and him (and you)\u2026 but *thinking* that football is a valid reason to skip dinner does not actually make it a valid reason. He will absolutely be TA if he chooses to not go to dinner.", "It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cimportant\u201d this match is. If you prioritize a FOOTBALL GAME over the commitments you made to your partner you\u2019re an AH lol", "I'm not in the least interested in football, but as soon as I saw 'Chelsea vs Arsenal', I thought \"yeah, this guy needs to go!\" I mean... she says the family know him; they must know his interests and the mother would probably understand. I very much doubt her daughter's boyfriend is the most important person for her to see on her birthday. He could just meet them for drinks after the meal.\n\nHer **telling** him he couldn't go to the match really got my back up. She could explain how important it is to her and ask him to please miss the match. She can't **tell** him to.\n\nI'd go to the meal, but I'm not really into anything that specifically needs to be watched live.", "you can be upfront and still be inconsiderate.  In most relationships, the family event, especially if not often, is the priority.  When football, friends start pushing OP out ... then you know where his priorities lie.  \n\nOP and partner's priorities are mis-aligned.", "Huh.  Responding by insulting your wife?", "Oooh, patronising.", "Then he shouldn't have agreed to important plans on that day. \n\n\nIf it's really that vital that he goes and he knew the time was uncertain, then you just don't plan anything important on those days.", "And you still think it is okay for him to skip, because a football game is more important. At least that is what you give off. Tf.", "I went and had a Google search, and I have excellent news! The 23/24 PL season is available for streaming via an app. As it's the world's most popular sport, I can only imagine how deeply embarrassing it would be if it wasn't. I assume other seasons are as well, but PL isn't very popular in my country and I'm not interested enough in watching you try to justify him to download the app and see. If it's not a PL game and he doesn't have a way to record or friends to record it for him, he can still tough out an X/YT highlight reel for one single, solitary game in order to be a decent partner.", "Yeah it's Chelsea v arsenal on thatbday at 1730, it has been moved to the late kick off for TV, so 100%, televised", "For every match? Probably not. For one match, to be a decent partner? Yeah, he can put on his big boy pants and tough it.", "If he can't miss one game to pay some respect to his SO, her mother and his own words, he better stay goddamn single and marry a ball or his own hand.", "You've made your point of view very clear. He should attend regardless of agreeing / committing to an event with her and her family. He should put the match above his desire to be present for his girlfriend and showing that he values her and her happiness. \n\nThe event is planned with lots of people, not just OP and her boyfriend. All the schedules have to be taken into account, all the travelling and convenient days. They can't plan around one boy who is a slave to his football matches. Kick off times change all the time due to TV scheduling, it's well know, but if you have committed / agreed/ told you partner you're going to attend a family event with them then you really need to attend. \n\nMy educated guess is she didn't arrange the meal herself and that is not indicated anywhere in her post. Even if she did, he would have been able to attend the match prior to the change to kick off time. That was acceptable to him. But it's only not acceptable now what he wants to do is being put at risk. \n\nThe planning of the event has now happened, she's asking what she should do about him attending.", "OP already planned. The schedule involved his ability to come until they changed time. How could the expect that? And how would op schedule her mother's milestone birthday?", "yea idk, doesnt really have anything to do with my argument", "If a non season ticket holder pays about \u00a340 - \u00a350 per game, the season ticket holder gets it cheaper. \n\nThey also get access to away games and early access to tickets for cup games at the stadium. \n\nA lot of it is about guaranteeing your seat and getting the good view you have from it. oh and the atmosphere.", "Nothing in the post says the 21st is her birthday, it says that is the day the dinner is scheduled", "There is nothing in the original comment that days her birthday is the 21st.  It says the dinner is scheduled for that day", "There is no mention that the 21st is the actual birthday, even if it is was, celebrations of milestones very often take place on a date that is not the exact date of an event.\n\nWould it be nice of him to be there, absolutely.  But his gf is not giving any importance to something he clearly loves and she could have scheduled around.", "Sorry 50 not 59", "That and age and location. Average age of first marriage there is over 30....like come now people, this couple isn't likely going to get married ever.  There's probably 2 whole other relationships at a minimum between either of them and getting married.", "I do....that's why I don't inflict my family on them", "He agreed. But the circumstances change.", "I don't think it's necessarily saying that though. He may have just looked at it (naively admittedly) as something for her family that didn't really involve him. He may not have even realized how much she wanted him there. \n\nAgain I'm stressing communication before going nuclear. I don't understand why it's so controversial to suggest talking things out first", "Yeah, you obviously don't like football, lol.", "I love my wife and both make sacrifices for each other all the time.  I was replying to someone who said I didn't know how to do that", "I agree.  I just think they could have avoided all the hassle", "Don\u2019t think he is in the right, but you can\u2019t stream all PL games on a single app in the UK\n\nAlthough this match is likely to be televised if it\u2019s the 5.30 Saturday slot", "I love the way this guy is so passionate about how important football  is and and the boyfriend isn't being unreasonable. But he couldn't just google this", "Okay", "Yeah, I'm with you. I enjoy my sports but I've never chose watching/going over an important event.", "If it's not the actual day of her birthday I'll put money on it being the Saturday night closest to her birthday. Which is the most normal time to ever celebrate!", "And you do.  Because your wife is Italian.  Your sacrifice is being married to your wife because she's Italian.  That's it.\n\nI mean, okay."]}
