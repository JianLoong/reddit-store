There was no party or celebratory event, no phone call or text message from my parents. This isn't to say that I wanted a big gift/event, either. I was perfectly fine with a simple \"good job.\" But my graduation went utterly unnoticed and unacknowledged by them. I should mention by this time; my family moved to the suburbs as we were doing better financially.  \nFast forward another few years, and again, I am the first in my family to graduate with a master's degree. Similarly, they both knew about my graduation, but again, there was no acknowledgment.   \nLast month, I graduated with another master's degree.

I confronted my parents, asking them where my gifts were when I graduated with my BA? My first MS? I didn't even care about gifts or an event; I just wanted a simple \"good job,\" but I didn't even get that either. Why didn't they acknowledge my achievements then? Why did I always have to buy my own graduation gifts? I always had to celebrate me. And now that my sister graduated, they suddenly want to acknowledge me? I wanted nothing to do with it.

Wow, four separate and major firsts for you and your family and now they want to celebrate? When your sister graduates? I'd be angry too. Your siblings really need to acknowledge the discrimination here and realise that you went above and beyond your entire life and it was continually ignored only to have it almost thrown in your face when she finally achieved something. Your anger is justified.", "NTA. I painfully relate to you, OP. I am the second oldest child and was thrown into being an adult/parent to my younger sister way too young. I am so sorry you're dealing with this. It can be really difficult to believe your own emotions when you're being told that you're being dramatic, selfish, and overreacting. Your thoughts and feelings on this matter are so valid. \n\nWhat helped me create a healthier relationship with my mother was putting boundaries in place. It was HARD at first, especially because she didn't respect that I was trying to protect my own peace and wellbeing. But I kept reminding myself that \"her reaction to my boundaries is not my responsibility\".\n\nYou deserve to be celebrated, but you don't deserve to beg to be celebrated. Your family's validation, approval, and acknowledgment will unfortunately never be what you want it to. If they've been dismissive this long, that won't change. \n\nBeing proud of yourself is so much more important than your family being proud of you. That took a long time for me to accept. I am sending you a lot of love, OP, as I know exactly how you feel.", "NTA  \n\n\nI grew up with both younger half-siblings (One at mothers, one at fathers) being treated as the golden children while I received physical and mental abuse. Both are grown now and my half sister is a druggie and my half brother is an entitled jackass.   \n\n\nMy father ended up raising my nieces and nephew and gave them the life and dadding that I never received. Those kids received the childhood I never got to have. I don't begrudge the kids, but I realized that both of my parents are just terrible people.  \n\n\nI went no contact with both and it has been such a healthy decision. I'm a dad now and I will never let them be in contact with either of my parents, and I will take the lessons never taught to be the best parent I can.", "NTA. It had to be said.  Some people/parents suck.", "Honestly, NTA. It sounds like your parents 100% think of you as the family nanny/3rd parent, rather than a child of theirs. You were parentified and faced emotional neglect. It's difficult to both love your younger siblings and feel jealousy because they are getting the love and attention you never received. Your siblings don't understand this, so they think you are overreacting. For your mental well-being it may help to speak to a therapist and ask about how to establish boundaries with your family and how to navigate these dynamics.", "I'm not going to judge as you say there's a lot of missing context, but what I will say is that we find parental role models in all walks of life at all stages of life.  I met my \"work dad\" who has really taken me on and who I've learnt so much from - he's 70 now and I'm 51 but he took me on in my 30's.  My own dad was a useless role model in that sense, so I floundered a lot at work for so long, but you never know when someone will come to fill different gaps.  Just to reassure you a little, it's not too late to find elders who can inspire and support in ways you felt missing.", "Your parents sucks you don't need them they are trash and sucks, you deserve better cut contact with them", "NTA, i'd cut them out of my life honestly.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think you over reacted. I also think you should probably cut ties with your parents. They are causing you more harm than good. I would make your sibling aware of your feelings towards them (siblings) if they feel the same foster or maintain relationships with them. Make it known that unless Mom and Dad want to truly mend fences they must make contact. You deserve better.", "No apologies necessary. You said your piece. I doubt at this point it will have much effect but sometimes it's good to just get things out in the open. NTA", "NTA. And, no, you absolutely don't owe your parents an apology. THEY owe YOU one, but honey, don't hold your breath. Feel free to go LC or NC with your family; you owe them nothing. Congrats on getting your degrees!", "NTA- and your siblings don't really get a fair vote as you cared for them.  And I'm willing to bet you did your best to shield them from your resentment over being forced into parental role.  \n\nThe children raised by their siblings don't always notice the sacrifice their siblings made.  They just assume that everyone had the same childhood.\n\nSometimes in these scenarios going low or no contact is the only way.  But that is up to you and your relationships.  But if they are only causing you pain, You don't deserve that.", "You are most definitely NTA.  Your entire family sounds like TA.  You are awesome!  Way to go and stay driven.  What you said to them perfectly embodied everything you have felt for years.  There is nothing to be sorry there.  Great job! I'm sure everyone here is VERY proud of you.", "I\u2019m proud of you for raising your siblings, many people would just leave.", "NTA. Congratulations on all your accomplishments!! \n\nYes, you said some harsh words, but it had built up for a while. You stated that you were the first from your family to graduate anything, is it possible that they (your parents) just did not realize what you expected from them? Could it be that by the time that you sent a congratulations card and gift to your sister, they were finally catching on to the idea that things like graduations are things to be acknowledged and celebrated? (It maybe was a foreign thought to them before.)\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure their experience with \u201cgoing to school\u201d was nothing like what you went through and accomplished. Some comments here may be along the lines of \u201cwhat were they thinking!\u201d but I, personally, do not equate their actions with their love for you. I believe they do love you very deeply and I\u2019m sure they are very proud of you and your accomplishments. Acknowledge that they made sacrifices for their children and family, because they did. \n\nYou have now voiced your feelings about things,  and time will move on. It probably feels good to you that your thoughts and feelings are out. That\u2019s a good thing. Hold your head high, feel pride in yourself about all your accomplishments (but stay humble.) Show maturity and grace to those around you. You\u2019ve done good in life, be proud of yourself. But maybe start thinking about this issue a little bit differently though; frame it in a healthier manner that will help you live with it all a little bit easier. Again, I think your parents really do love you but maybe just did not realize how important schooling and education is to you.", "Congrats!! No contact seams right.
