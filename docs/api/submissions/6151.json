I love AITA on Twitter but I need some advice here from some anonymous internet strangers. \n\nSo for context I\u2019ve (f33) been married just over 2 years to m35. Over this time I\u2019ve come to know my husband a little better. \n\nWe were at our local pharmacy today to stock up on medication for a trip we\u2019re doing next week. \n\nAnyway he was in a shitty mood all morning, swearing loudly because I was late to a brunch with a friend (10mins late) and making digs. For example while at the pharmacy I accidentally disabled my iPhone and he rolled his eyes saying  \u201cYou\u2019re so ditzy\u201d. \n\nWe go to the cashier and there weren\u2019t many items we were getting, just the medication and some mosquito repellent. [I added some batteries we needed and he removed them saying he wants another brand which I offered to get and he said he\u2019ll get them another time (I added this coz cashier by probably saw this interaction)] \nAs he was putting the items on the counter and paying,  I was sort of standing to the side and, I admit, thinking about what else I need for this trip. The cashier slaps her hands together to make a loud clap. As I look over confused she says to me \u201cHey, you were daydreaming, you were in another world there\u201c I found this extremely rude. \nBut my husband, he says to the cashier \u201cJust tell her (meaning me) she needs to wake up\u201d like taking this cashiers side and agreeing with her rude behaviour. He did not defend me at all. \nI\u2019m done with brushing off shitty disrespectful behaviour so I look at this lady in the eye and say \u201cThat\u2019s very rude and not how you treat customers.\u201c this poor old lady got all apologetic like \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry it was a joke I didn\u2019t meant it\u201d and my husband takes her side again and says \u201coh it was a joke, she didn\u2019t mean it\u201d. I was livid so hissed at him to shut up and the lady goes \u201cI\u2019m very sorry I feel so bad bad now\u201d so me being upset and angry I told her \u201cyou should feel bad\u201d and I walked out the store .

I don't think anyone would have sided with you behaving like that.\n\nI'm also not sure what all the backstory with your husband saying cruel things is about since it's not relevant to the interaction with the cashier that day except maybe you're taking your anger over realizing you don't actually like the person you married out on the poor cashier.", "YTA, your husband seems like a jerk but being shitty to customer service people is always an asshole move. And she apologized and you were still a jerk to her. Not a good look.

Don't know why you didn't address the issues you had with him instead of offloading on the cashier. \n\nHot take I guess but, I think the cashier's joke was pretty rude. \n\nYou suck for your reaction. Yeah, they were rude but, they apologised and you didn't let it go or report them if it bothered you that much. You just wanted them to feel like shit because your husband had been making you feel like shit all day. \n\nESH.", "NTA I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind reading these comments.

Your husband sucks for obvious reasons, I\u2019m not even entirely sure why you stay with him. \n\nBut the cashier was shitty to you for no reason, per your comments you weren\u2019t even paying so she did not need your attention at all. Clapping at you makes no sense in this situation tbh, your husband was paying.", "NTA Wait a second guys maybe I am reading this wrong.  Why did the cashier need her attention?  The husband was paying she was just waiting.  I often fall into a daydream state when I am waiting and not needed and I would be very upset if some stranger chose to snap me out of it by clapping for no reason and my husband would totally back me up.  Maybe she was transferring some of her anger at her husband (which she should deal with) but the cashier was being very rude and literally in OP's face.", "NTA.\n\nI don't know what planet the people in this sub grew up on, but in what way is clapping your hands at a customer to get their attention professional??? If someone came on this sub and said \"AITA for clapping in my servers face to get her attention?\" they'd be ripped to shreds. You weren't paying so she didn't need to interact with you period, and your transaction obviously wasn't over so you weren't holding up any line.\n\nYour husband is a whole other beast, and if this behavior is typical of him, I'd just leave him. No one deserves to be treated that way.", "The cashier sucks because she didn't stay in her lane. Your husband sucks because he....well, everything you said. But you know who sucks most??? You. YTA for allowing your husband's abuse, for letting his bad attitude affect how you treat others, and for continuing to be ugly after the cashier apologized.

Even if she did witness something between you and your husband, it was rude of her to do that to you.", "NTA, he was paying and you were standing off to the side.  There was absolutely no reason why she needed to get your attention and especially no reason to do it so rudely like that.  Someone needed to let her know that clapping your hands at someone who\u2019s spaced out like that is generally just rude.  Your husband sounds shitty too.", "Idc who's the asshole here, I'm just completely flabbergasted at how many ppl get so worked up over petty little incidents like this.

Please communicate with your husband about how his words make you feel.", "YTA. So which is it? Did she clap in your face or were not even in line? Because you say she didn\u2019t need to interact with you but then you say she clapped in your face. \n\nBut either way you were rude. She probably wasn\u2019t even meaning to be rude and you took it to 1000 because you were mad at your husband. He is an AH too.

From the tone of the post, it sounds like her and your husband were poking fun at you, which is unkind and not professional. And she never said why she clapped at you.  Like, your husband was paying, what did she need from you? Clapping at you like a dog was rude esp. since if it was important she'd mention what she needed. I'm glad she apologized and I hope she learns from this, bc that isn't a respectful way to get someone's attention.\n\nYou, because the cashier apologized. If you're angry with your husband, direct it to him. She tried to make amends for her mistake. It sounds like you're continuing the cycle of your husband demeaning you and re-directing it towards a cashier. \n\nAt the end of the day, this is a very small, petty problem. But it does show a lot of underlying issues.", "YTA, in so many ways.  You admitted you were daydreaming in line.  The world does not revolve around you, and you are not perfect.   She wasn't rude, you were.  I'm sure anyone behind you in line appreciated the cashier moving things more quickly.  \n\nAnd then to overreact, in public no less, to someone who is just doing their job.  I mean, wow.  \n\nAnd finally, to share this story, type it out, and not realize you're the asshole here and owe the cashier an apology?  I feel sorry for your husband for having to live with you.", "NTA, the AHs are your husband and everyone in this thread defending the cashier. The cashier was rude, and OP overreacted, but was not an AH. I get that  customer service gets treated like garbage and it's a triggering subject, but that's not what happened here. Most everyone here has a hardon to chastise OP for a societal issue she didn't contribute to.", "ESH.

I agree that your husband doesn\u2019t sound that nice, but you seem pretty judgmental yourself. Maybe you should reconsider your marriage if it causes you to act like this.", "YTA and your husband. It\u2019s your husband that is working you up and you took it out on the cashier. He sounds awful, how did you not notice this before?", "So your husband has been rude to you all morning and you brushed his behavior away. The cashier claps at you and apologizes but you are rude to her. Your husband takes her side and you are rude to her; again. YTA. Use that energy on your husband. He\u2019s the one you are angry with, not her.", "YTA: It's not fair to vent our frustrations on people who don't deserve it.\n\nI do understand why you did it though. It sounds like you've been thinking about the type of person you married. Commenting on other people and putting you down point to him being insecure. Hopefully it's just a phase he is going through and you can explain to him how his immature behavior makes you feel and makes him look. If you see that register lady again, I bet she'd appreciate it if you'd apologized.", "YTA she wasn't rude or treating you badly. Customer service workers are generally overly friendly/jokesters because their employer wants them to be. Way to make someone feel like shit for no reason, though. And yes, you're also TA for getting mad at your husband for trying to make light of an awkward situation you caused.", "YTA - Your husband sounds like a real prize and an AH in his own right but in regards to your attitude towards the cashier you overreacted. \n\n>I\u2019m done with brushing off shitty disrespectful behaviour\n\nYou're literally admitting you were mad at your husband and took it out on her.", "YTA-  you took your frustrations out on the cashier instead of the AH husband.", "YTA. Be nice to customer service employees. Full stop. That woman probably served over a hundred people on that day. Imagine if they had all treated her as you did. And your husband sounds terrible. And you sound terrible. I hope you had a nice trip though.", "YTA because you were mostly mad at your husband and you took it out on the cashier.

Ya'll took your nasty toxic relationship and dumped it all over this woman's day - yuck.", "So what the cashier did wasn\u2019t great, but you kinda aimed all your anger at her instead of where it should be aimed: your husband, so I can\u2019t really decide whether E S H or Y T A.", "YTA. GEEZ. It was an innocent comment.", "YTA - that cashier did nothing wrong to you and your husband had every right to take her side even if he wasn't being the nicest to you. You have multiple people in these comments telling you how rude you were to this woman and you cant look past your own narcissism to realize you may have been wrong throughout the entirety of this interaction with this woman.

He never made those comments so brazenly while we were dating.\n\nFrom the original posting, for context", "She edited out an entire paragraph going on about how rude and immature her husband is (he'll call other people stupid or ugly) and he wasn't like this while they were dating and she's only come to realize how abhorrent his behavior is now that they're married.  That paragraph made it pretty clear that she doesn't much care for her husband.  There was a lot of disdain in that now missing paragraph.", "Why tf are people down voting this. The OP is accepting the judgment and taking the criticism but you are all still mad at her??", "Want to bet?", ">clapping at you instead of saying excuse me or hello\n\nHow sure are you that she didn't?", "> Honey, I was not in the line. I was standing to the side while my husband was in line paying.\n\nI thought you _weren\u2019t_ in line though?", "Lady I've had cashier's snap their fingers at me and still didn't act like a bi**h about it. You ask if you were the asshole and the has be said multiple times. Yes YTA!!! Now quite doubling down and except the judgement.\n\nYTA", "Op can lie to us but not the automod", "This is my question too. If OP was spacing out, I\u2019m betting she had talked to her a couple times before resorting to clapping.", "OP wasn\u2019t spacing out. She was thinking about why other items she needed for her upcoming trip. A very normal thing that people do when waiting."]}
