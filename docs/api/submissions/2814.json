The rules he is setting out while seem to be over-the-top to me may very well be reasonable to him and I very well could be over-reacting and being an asshole/petty by taking away all of the furnishings.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019d make sure you give him notice and/or keep very good records of all of this if he tries to do anything legally in the future if you leave. Depending on where you live, there might be tenant laws etc if you signed a lease/tenant agreement with him. I\u2019m not a lawyer but have had really shitty landlords before and heard nightmare roommate stories. Make sure all your bases are covered because he sounds UNHINGED.", "NTA. And he should pay you for any broken items", "NTA I am a bit concerned about Chaz, though. He seems to be having a mental breakdown of some kind. Is he on the spectrum? Or perhaps he is desperately seeking control at home because things are spiraling out of control at work? I'm only guessing here, but his behavior isn't really normal.", "NTA and it sounds like Chaz is having some mental illness issues, if not heading towards a breakdown. What he\u2019s demanding of you is unreasonable - all of it. This is not how sharing a home works. I do think you\u2019re doing the right thing by slowly moving everything out, and the potential new job seems like it has more upsides to it than not. Consider it seriously. You deserve to enjoy your home and your personal life, and Chaz is not allowing that. For the sake of your own mental health, you need to make a big change here.", "*several electrical outlets not working altogether and Chaz is refusing to fix any of them*\n\nFrom someone who once had a house fire, THIS IS SCARY AS HELL.\n\nGet your stuff out of there, OP, and don't sleep there again.  Your very life could be in danger.  Electrical fires can start in walls, smolder, and fill a building with lethal smoke while people sleep.\n\nNTA", "Esh\n\nIt doesnt sound like you guys live the same lifestyle anymore.  He owns a home now and he is a perfectionist so all your stuff feels like clutter to him.  It would be nice if you could both have an honest conversation about it, but if you cant, then it's time to move out.  \n\nBut I'd tell him too.  If you empty the guest room suddenly without telling him, don't be surprised if he asks you to leave before you are ready.  But also give him a heads up that he will need to find a new roommate too. You don't want to blindside him.  \n\nYou saved a lot of rent living with him.  All he is doing is asking you to do is keep everything extremely tidy.  But if it's too much, there is no reason to end in a bad note.  It's just not the way you want to live.  He hasn't done anything to you.", "Thank you so much for the reply! My parents have already offered me my old room back home, which would be nice to have until I get my feet off the ground. I already offered to pay rent if that becomes the case. COL is much lower where they are at so very good point it would be like a raise in a sense. I very much appreciate your input and I quite agree things are progressively getting worse/I will have to find new housing regardless.", "Thank you! I appreciate the reply and your input to my decision makes me feel like I'm not being a complete jerk through this whole endeavor.", "Thank you for the reply! \n\nIt's been a miserable 6 months but I've been biting my lip. The job back home would definitely boost my resume, not necessarily as much as my current job, however, the new job would have significantly more room to move upward than my current job which does not have much promotion potential. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!", "This is a very good point and a real concern. I initially approached this situation thinking this might very well be the case which is why I've waited 5 months from the initial issues to post anything. Unfortunately from everyone I've talked to, it appears the job is very much changing him. Chaz (without giving away personal information) basically is in quality control and has never been a person of patients. He is very much a perfectionist as well, so his approach at work from what I've been told by his supervisors and coworkers is that of large doses of hostility, then back to friendly with his counterparts. I feel there is a chance he's looking at the house like quality control and that it must be perfect at all times. There very well could be much more going on in the picture that I am not aware of as well, but he refuses to speak to me about much anything anymore unless he is implementing a new rule. I have voiced concern about his mental health at home to a mutual friend of ours who is very discrete and is going to start keeping an eye on him for me. He was an incredible friend to me before we lived together, while I am unfortunately in this awkward living condition with him, I still care about him.", "I very much appreciate your reply! Unfortunately, we do not have any formal documents which is both a positive as well as a negative. Positive because it allows me to remove my items as I wish, as well as if and when I decide to move out, I'm not tied to a lease with him. Negatively because both of the major items that we verbally agreed to being the bathroom situation as well as the temperature control of the house have already been broken as well as there has already been an attempt at an increase in rent, which failed after I pointed out that I am already paying half of all costs.", "Thank you for the reply! I really appreciate everyone's insight.", "I wanted to start by saying thank you for the compliment, it made me smile! Everyones insight and thoughts have been an incredible help to my outlook on how I should approach this situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a good point as well, being in quality control and having control issues, There is for sure some correlation there. I feel bad for him, he just seems like he's becoming such an angry person but I also don't want to be the victim of his anger.", "This is the second comment asking about if Chaz is alright and I very much appreciate your concern! I've been trying to look into if he's okay, as well as a very close friend of ours has been as well. it seems to be that from what we've found he's completely okay beyond the stress of work, so if something is bothering him or causing him a possible mental crisis its well hidden... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I appreciate you bringing this up! My items were actually hung up in the closet, in the pantry, or in the cupboards, he actually pulled everything out and make a pile of the items because he did not like where they were stored. I honestly wish he would just talk to me about everything so we could handle this better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate the reply and input!", "I very much appreciate your reply! My name is not on any documentation, the house fully belongs to him. My current rent with him is $700 plus utilities a month, which is less than half of what my housing costs were at the house I previously rented. His approach and mindset was that since two of us are in the house, split everything cost-wise down the middle, since this approach was going to save me a decent amount of money I did not complain. That being said it has been noted by him that it's a good thing I'm living with him because he could not afford the mortgage on his own.", "Thank you for the insight!", "Thank you for your reply! \n\nI've been moving a few of the larger items and most of the smaller items to my parents, who have been very understanding and helpful which I am incredibly appreciative of. I have been saving the largest items for last which is the entire guest bedroom as well as several other large pieces of furniture that I am either going to sell, or give away since I will not be needing them regardless of if I move home, or get another roommate situation going.", "I really appreciate your response! After seeing what everyone has been saying, I think I\u2019m going to seriously consider looking into it based off of the major benefits, including my own mental health and happiness!", "This is concerning but very helpful information, I really appreciate the response! I\u2019m thankfully going to be out of town the next few weeks on a business trip. This definitely takes priority, and is worth having a conversation over no matter the outcome or hurt feelings.", "I\u2019d like to start by saying thank you for your reply! I agree with you I do not believe we live in the same lifestyle anymore. I\u2019ve kept them aware that I am attempting to little more minimalist lifestyle. I have not told him yet about the guestroom that is a conversation. I am waiting for the right time to have. I have saved a lot of money living with him that being said, I believe his definition of tidy in my definition of tidy or on two different spectrums when it comes time for me to finally move out, I\u2019m going to attempt to at least give him about a two month notice if I can.", "If I were you, I'd either move out, OR - if doing that right now is too tricky - insist that you have a written agreement. It can be an email, even. But something that proves, beyond any smoke & mirrors he tries to cast, what the deal is (and isn't). Maybe check out what the laws of your state/county say about landlords who don't issue verbal agreements - for all you know, he might not be reporting this income to the tax office, which is illegal (and gives you leverage).", "Your reply made me smile as well.  Thanks!\n\nThink about it, if a perfectionist is in charge of hundreds of other people, and those people are human... it sets everyone up for failure.\n\nPeople are human, they make honest mistakes, they get sick, or they get a flat tire... all kinds of things can contribute to sub-par performance at work.  A supervisor with perfectionist tendencies is set up to fail.\n\nWhat he cannot control at work, he tries to control at home - thus impacting you.\n\nI strongly urge you to contact friends or family of his to check on him 1-2 weeks after you completely leave.  Worst case, call the police for a wellness check.  My gut tells me he might decompensate after you leave.\n\nFor a brief glimpse of normal (I hope).  I 56F work in a lawn and garden center - so there's lots of dirt, fertilizer, and bugs around.  At first I cleaned my nails multiple times a day - and it got to where it hurt.  Now I paint my nails and I clean them before and after work daily.  If I look at my nails during the day I see some pretty color, today it is purple.  Being \"too clean\" hurt my hands, so I coped in a different way.", "Then leave, as quickly as you can.", "Then he is using you. This is not a fair agreement - he gets a furnished home at half the price and you get\u2026..a bunch of bullshit rules and no protection as a roommate. Seriously he could kick you out tomorrow and claim you were a squatter - and KEEP all your stuff. You have no protections in this situation. The only \u201cbenefit\u201d you got was a roof over your head. Run away!\n\nEither he knows he\u2019s taking advantage and is pushing it as far as he can cuz he thinks you won\u2019t stop him, or he\u2019s a moron who doesn\u2019t realize how good he had it.", "Wow! This is awesome. Fantastic ideas as well as an awesome avenue for me to pursue and look into! I'll definitely do some reading today and see what I can find out. I can not thank you enough for your insight it is incredibly valuable!"]}
