And he should pay you for any broken items", "NTA I am a bit concerned about Chaz, though. He seems to be having a mental breakdown of some kind. Is he on the spectrum?

I do think you\u2019re doing the right thing by slowly moving everything out, and the potential new job seems like it has more upsides to it than not. Consider it seriously. You deserve to enjoy your home and your personal life, and Chaz is not allowing that.

He owns a home now and he is a perfectionist so all your stuff feels like clutter to him.  It would be nice if you could both have an honest conversation about it, but if you cant, then it's time to move out.  \n\nBut I'd tell him too.  If you empty the guest room suddenly without telling him, don't be surprised if he asks you to leave before you are ready.  But also give him a heads up that he will need to find a new roommate too. You don't want to blindside him.  \n\nYou saved a lot of rent living with him.  All he is doing is asking you to do is keep everything extremely tidy.

My parents have already offered me my old room back home, which would be nice to have until I get my feet off the ground. I already offered to pay rent if that becomes the case.

I initially approached this situation thinking this might very well be the case which is why I've waited 5 months from the initial issues to post anything. Unfortunately from everyone I've talked to, it appears the job is very much changing him. Chaz (without giving away personal information) basically is in quality control and has never been a person of patients. He is very much a perfectionist as well, so his approach at work from what I've been told by his supervisors and coworkers is that of large doses of hostility, then back to friendly with his counterparts. I feel there is a chance he's looking at the house like quality control and that it must be perfect at all times. There very well could be much more going on in the picture that I am not aware of as well, but he refuses to speak to me about much anything anymore unless he is implementing a new rule. I have voiced concern about his mental health at home to a mutual friend of ours who is very discrete and is going to start keeping an eye on him for me. He was an incredible friend to me before we lived together, while I am unfortunately in this awkward living condition with him, I still care about him.", "I very much appreciate your reply! Unfortunately, we do not have any formal documents which is both a positive as well as a negative. Positive because it allows me to remove my items as I wish, as well as if and when I decide to move out, I'm not tied to a lease with him. Negatively because both of the major items that we verbally agreed to being the bathroom situation as well as the temperature control of the house have already been broken as well as there has already been an attempt at an increase in rent, which failed after I pointed out that I am already paying half of all costs.", "Thank you for the reply! I really appreciate everyone's insight.", "I wanted to start by saying thank you for the compliment, it made me smile! Everyones insight and thoughts have been an incredible help to my outlook on how I should approach this situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a good point as well, being in quality control and having control issues, There is for sure some correlation there. I feel bad for him, he just seems like he's becoming such an angry person but I also don't want to be the victim of his anger.", "This is the second comment asking about if Chaz is alright and I very much appreciate your concern! I've been trying to look into if he's okay, as well as a very close friend of ours has been as well. it seems to be that from what we've found he's completely okay beyond the stress of work, so if something is bothering him or causing him a possible mental crisis its well hidden... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I appreciate you bringing this up! My items were actually hung up in the closet, in the pantry, or in the cupboards, he actually pulled everything out and make a pile of the items because he did not like where they were stored. I honestly wish he would just talk to me about everything so we could handle this better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate the reply and input!", "I very much appreciate your reply! My name is not on any documentation, the house fully belongs to him. My current rent with him is $700 plus utilities a month, which is less than half of what my housing costs were at the house I previously rented. His approach and mindset was that since two of us are in the house, split everything cost-wise down the middle, since this approach was going to save me a decent amount of money I did not complain. That being said it has been noted by him that it's a good thing I'm living with him because he could not afford the mortgage on his own.", "Thank you for the insight!", "Thank you for your reply! \n\nI've been moving a few of the larger items and most of the smaller items to my parents, who have been very understanding and helpful which I am incredibly appreciative of. I have been saving the largest items for last which is the entire guest bedroom as well as several other large pieces of furniture that I am either going to sell, or give away since I will not be needing them regardless of if I move home, or get another roommate situation going.", "I really appreciate your response! After seeing what everyone has been saying, I think I\u2019m going to seriously consider looking into it based off of the major benefits, including my own mental health and happiness!", "This is concerning but very helpful information, I really appreciate the response! I\u2019m thankfully going to be out of town the next few weeks on a business trip. This definitely takes priority, and is worth having a conversation over no matter the outcome or hurt feelings.", "I\u2019d like to start by saying thank you for your reply! I agree with you I do not believe we live in the same lifestyle anymore. I\u2019ve kept them aware that I am attempting to little more minimalist lifestyle. I have not told him yet about the guestroom that is a conversation. I am waiting for the right time to have. I have saved a lot of money living with him that being said, I believe his definition of tidy in my definition of tidy or on two different spectrums when it comes time for me to finally move out, I\u2019m going to attempt to at least give him about a two month notice if I can.", "If I were you, I'd either move out, OR - if doing that right now is too tricky - insist that you have a written agreement. It can be an email, even. But something that proves, beyond any smoke & mirrors he tries to cast, what the deal is (and isn't). Maybe check out what the laws of your state/county say about landlords who don't issue verbal agreements - for all you know, he might not be reporting this income to the tax office, which is illegal (and gives you leverage).", "Your reply made me smile as well.  Thanks!\n\nThink about it, if a perfectionist is in charge of hundreds of other people, and those people are human... it sets everyone up for failure.\n\nPeople are human, they make honest mistakes, they get sick, or they get a flat tire... all kinds of things can contribute to sub-par performance at work.  A supervisor with perfectionist tendencies is set up to fail.\n\nWhat he cannot control at work, he tries to control at home - thus impacting you.\n\nI strongly urge you to contact friends or family of his to check on him 1-2 weeks after you completely leave.  Worst case, call the police for a wellness check.  My gut tells me he might decompensate after you leave.\n\nFor a brief glimpse of normal (I hope).  I 56F work in a lawn and garden center - so there's lots of dirt, fertilizer, and bugs around.  At first I cleaned my nails multiple times a day - and it got to where it hurt.  Now I paint my nails and I clean them before and after work daily.  If I look at my nails during the day I see some pretty color, today it is purple.  Being \"too clean\" hurt my hands, so I coped in a different way.", "Then leave, as quickly as you can.", "Then he is using you. This is not a fair agreement - he gets a furnished home at half the price and you get\u2026..a bunch of bullshit rules and no protection as a roommate. Seriously he could kick you out tomorrow and claim you were a squatter - and KEEP all your stuff. You have no protections in this situation. The only \u201cbenefit\u201d you got was a roof over your head.

I had extreme rules; I couldn't have people over at all, had to cook only at certain times, and constantly had to clean and keep quiet at all times. it was stressful, and I got out. these are unacceptable conditions for living. I hope you get out too. it's OK to live briefly with parents, you'll save money, be less stressed and have more freedom.", "NTA. I hope you find a solution to your problem soon. Your living arrangement sounds like a nightmare. One should be comfortable where you live. Good luck.", "NTA, he lied to you about what the situation was. What he wanted was a room renter who would supply household items for him to use. Him saying that besides the items that he wanted to use, everything else need to be kept out of the common space is him saying that. But he didn't make a clear arrangement with you when you moved in.\n\nNo you're not wrong for no longer doing a favor for someone who is fucking you over. But it sounds like even though you like your current job and the workload, if you can't find housing where You are at, and housing is a major stressor for you, you need to take that job.", "NTA, you should also take him to small claims court for breaking all your stuff", "You are not paying the mortgage if your name is not on the deed. You are paying rent.", "NTA", "Oh my. \n\nThat's a laundry list full of BS. And there was no inclination that he was like this, prior to moving into the new place? I know you like the job you're at, and that's great. However, I'm now wondering how toxic this job will become, once he's lied about the circumstances. \n\nThis is my opinion, but I think it might best, in your interests, to go to the new job, which is in the same city as your parents. It might be twice the workload, but it won't have the toxicity your \"friend\" has incurred. \n\nNTA", "Yes obsessive compulsive controlling behaviour+++\n\nEdit \ud83d\ude02 just read that he is a Quality Controller.

Unfortunately, he is very private about his family, while I have met them they do not use any form of social media so I would not be able to get their contact info unless it was directly through my roommate.", "Thank you for the reply! I will make sure to do my homework before I progress with anything. At this point, I haven't signed any documents but will make sure I cover my bases to ensure I'm good to go!", "Being that you are someone who completely understands what I am going through right now I really appreciate your comment, I'm glad you were able to get out and I'm hopeful as well!", "Thank you for your reply, that is a fair point, I am paying rent that is equivalent to half of the mortgage but it is still just rent, not the mortgage. Thank you for the comment!", "I do not believe he is on the spectrum, that being said, it could very much be what you said about control at work, he was hired for his degree field, however, is currently working outside of that field. He claims he enjoys it more, but he is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to knowledge so there could be something going on there I do not know about!", "No indications at all, I actually know several of his past roommates. The most recent was not a fan of him but would not share details to respect privacy which I completely understood. Prior to that individual, they were apartment roommates so those few people that know my situation all agree he's probably different now because he's an owner now not a renter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour opinion is valued by me, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and input! I'm very much starting to think this is the way I need to go.", "So, let's list the pros and cons to moving and taking the other job:\n \nPROS-\n- more money in your pocket \n- possibly less rent\n- more room for advancement in your career\n- no obnoxious rules about how you walk around your home\n- no more of your belongings getting broken / ruined\n- being able to socialize in your home\n- being comfortable in your home\n-being closer to family ( if you're close to them)\n\n\nCONS-\n- roommate who breaks the original agreement to suit him\n- added stress\n- no room for advancement in current job\n- ROOMMATE SUCKS\n\n\n\n\nThe answer seems obvious. Don't continue to be treated so poorly by someone who is supposed to be your friend.  The only other thing I could suggest would be to talk to him.  Tell him that if things don't change you are moving out and he can pay for his mortgage on his own, in addition to replacing everything that you own and he currently uses.  It sounds like he would be better off kicking living alone as he has to many rules that people just can't live by. Rules that are ridiculous might I add.", "From what I am reading, this guy closed all communication channels, right? Info: before coming to this, how did you react to the multiple aggressions? Did you just comply or said \u201chey, Chaz, that\u2019s not OK, this is my place too\u201d? \n\n\n\nRegardless of it, I think you gave him a lot of free passes. It\u2019s not OK to do that with a roommate, less of all with someone who\u2019s financing your lifestyle (you provide for 50% of the costs *and* most of the household items). For what you\u2019ve said, it seems as if Chaz was having a hard time separating work from home. He might be developing a mental health issue, but that\u2019s up to him, not to you. \n\n\n\nYou deserve peace and respect in your own home. Like someone else mentioned, the defective appliances are a huge safety concern. Don\u2019t waste your time, gather everything up (not slowly, get out ASAP) and start afresh. I\u2019m not sure if I am reading too much into this, but\u2026 he does sound as someone who gets to dictate the rules and never listens to others, not even if it\u2019s serious. Is it like that? If yes, don\u2019t even bother talking to him about this. I\u2019d leave a note and keys, something alongside \u201chey, mate, sorry. I\u2019ve tried talking about this ever since xyz day. There\u2019s been no acceptable response to my concerns. We agreed to xyz. However, this has been broken by (his rules, the disrespecting your stuff -mention just the action and do state you never consented to it). This makes our agreement void. I wish you well.\u201c\n\n\n\nGood luck, OP. You\u2019re NTA.", "That's understandable about the previous roommates not wanting to talk about their living arrangements with this friend.\n\nI wish you all the best in the world. It's scary to start a new life in a new city, but I think you'll make the best decision for yourself.", "Thank you for your reply! This is a totally awesome pros and cons list that very much breaks down what seems to be the obvious answer that many people have stated should be the way to go! I appreciate you taking the time to write that out for me!

Our organization does have people who come through and do evaluations on how they feel the business is running and to my understanding his division has been rated very poorly the last few times, so I feel it is a matter of time until his supervisors start to take notice. From what I have read from the evaluations it very much is to do with too high of expectations from those overseeing quality control, it seems there is a difference between great, and perfect, and the fact so many products are being turned away for being great, not perfect is starting to take a toll..\n\nI think you and so many others have hit it right on the nose with his work to home life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really appreciate the awesome idea and I think I will follow through with that for sure.

This being said, in the past, if things began to not go his way, he would escalate and become aggressive. I would refuse to raise my voice, which is where the talking over me would take place, and he would just keep talking until I would give up or go away a few rare times I have raised my voice to the point of me yelling back and that is honestly the only time we have made any progress.

I told her that if she was going to allow him to live there too, I couldn't because my boyfriend wouldn't like it.  I was trying to not push her away, so I didn't say it was because he was abusive towards her and that I was worried for her even though she knew I was worried.  She told me that she would have understood if I was moving away or moving in with my boyfriend (who live 2 hours away), but she took it personally that I would just live on my own or with another roommate.  She ended up marrying the abusive boyfriend, he got her hooked on drugs and I haven't heard from her in 20+ years.  Although you may be trying to save your friendship, it may not work out the way you hope.  But for your sake I hope you can remain friends.", "Very good point! It may be hard based off of the job I do, but everything is worth trying! You are very right the worst thing they can say is no!", "Yes, run as fast as you can.", "I really appreciate your reply, and honestly what your saying heavily applies to me. The location of the house he bought is perfect, beautiful area, easy to get whatever you need shopping wise, as well as it isn\u2019t a bad commute whatsoever to get to work, but I find myself wanting to stay at work at the end of the day because it\u2019s like going home is a more stressful environment due to the heavy rules in place. Honestly the only thing I\u2019m getting is exactly that, storage and a place to lay my head at night but it really does not feel like a home whatsoever. The house I was renting, while costly in comparison, THAT felt like a home, I was able to relax, be myself, take a load off at the end of the day, which is a complete contrary situation to what I find myself in now\u2026 thank you for your input!!", "With how the world works these days sometimes yah just need to hear it, and I for sure have heard it. Reddit has blown me away once again with such an awesome and active community.", "I appreciate your reply! That is very useful insight! Many people have been urging me to move out for my own well being but that\u2019s a very good point that it also may be better for his mental health as well if he were to live alone!", "That is a very sad but incredible story. I\u2019m very sorry you lost your friend and it played out the way it did. It\u2019s sad to say but after the way things have played out, I\u2019m not incredibly worried if the friendship doesn\u2019t work out. He\u2019s a great guy and I always want to try to do the best thing, and be the best person I can be, but if it doesn\u2019t work out then it\u2019s life. He was a great friend, if I move out and things improve I will happily try to remain friends, after all he was a great friend to me, but he\u2019s going to have to want to fix the friendship as well, it\u2019s a two way road after all.  I just know never to live with the guy.", "That is a very sad but incredible story. I\u2019m very sorry you lost your friend and it played out the way it did.

I just know never to live with the guy.", "We could honestly be the same person haha\n\nThat was me prior to getting my place now at the start of the year - before then, I would find myself going to a restaurant or a bar after work because it meant just *not having to be home* for at least that extra one or two hours more.\n\nSure where I live now is a little more costly in rent, but it's improved my wellbeing immensely. I've lost weight, I feel a sense of place when I wake up in the morning, and just an overall stronger sense of comfort. I even started re-engaging with my hobbies, which is something I definitely put off in my old living situation because I felt like I would have to move water just to be able to enjoy them.\n\nYou'll be surprised at how much coming out of the arrangement you had with Chaz will make you appreciate the little things about your new living situation, which will blossom into enjoying the big things about it.", "Very true. If he doesn't want to do his part to fix your friendship, then there is nothing you can do.  I just hope it works out for you no matter what you choose to do.  You will find that you grow quite a bit in the years after you graduate.  Sometimes friends grow together and sometimes they don't.  All you can do is do what is best for you.", "Well if we really are the same person that means there\u2019s hope for me yet! Haha \n\nFirst I\u2019m really happy for you that you were able to find happiness in your new place! It seems like you\u2019re really blooming in your new arrangement and in a really happy place which is always awesome to hear about someone thriving in life. \n\nIt also sounds like the exact path I need to follow. What you just said is exactly what I want. Just somewhere that I feel comfortable at, can be myself and funny you mention the hobbies because almost all of my hobbies have been completely halted because I have nowhere I can actually DO my hobbies in the house. I honestly couldn\u2019t even do a puzzle if I wanted to let alone a hobby because I would have to pack it up after I needed a break due to the fact I\u2019m not allowed to leave any personal items out.. I\u2019m by no means a messy person when it comes to living, but man, it would be nice to be able to get back to my hobbies again.", "Well, I really appreciate your advice and insight into my situation! I'm looking forward to the growing and maturing that actually finally being able to be in the workforce will bring for me. I'm looking forward to life, just dealing with a little hiccup right now. I'm hoping whatever decision I go with works in the end, but that's just part of the journey of life!", "Well I wish you luck then and it sounds like you're making the best decision for you! <3\n\nAnd if you ever start to doubt yourself, try thinking of the fact that your abrupt egress will ultimately (or least hopefully) open Chaz's eyes to how much *he* was an implicit force in putting himself at a financial disadvantage. *He* drove *you* away and once he realises that, that will make him reconsider his approach to future tenants/roommates.", "Well thank you so much! :)  \n\n\nI will make sure to think of that because I know I will have doubts at some point, it\u2019s only human after all! \nI don\u2019t want to cause him any issues but I do feel like in the long run this will most definitely be a learning experience for the both of us!", "You are never an asshole or in the wrong for removing yourself and your stuff from abuse. NTA", "I've got the impression something is stressing him out and he's taking it out on you. When people lose control over their lives, they try to regain it by whatever means are necessary. Usually, this means they'll control people in their lives. I don't necessarily think this is because of anything you've done in particular, and he's just not taking something very well. You mentioned his job was stressful - perhaps that is where the problems start\n\nI would recommend preparing an escape plan and talking to him about the situation. This can't continue. But if you don't address it directly and move one day, I fear he might feel like he's losing even more control, and redirect his frustration toward you even more\n\nOverall, you're being disrespected and treated very poorly. He might not mean to, but you don't deserve this", "OP, you are DEFINITELY NTA. Your roommate sounds like an abusive ass. Get out now.", "Honestly, paying 50% doesn't allow him to act like a dictator in a home you two equally contribute to\n\nYou should have squashed this nonsense earlier on so it didn't ruin the comfort in the house. Before moving out, if you want, give him an ultimatum to change his attitude or just leave when he's out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but come on, just be an adult and be clear about it and move out. Stop stressing him out by slowly removing things one by one.", "NTA, get out of there, please.", "Don't get caught thinking there's only two choices here, parents or this roommate. Definitely don't take the double-hard job just to fix this roommate problem. Really look for a new place first.", "Run, NTA.", "You should try to move out as fast as possible, in case your roommate retaliates.", "It's such a shame that a great arrangement has gone sour. You are certainly NTA for wanting to get out of there, and it sounds like communication is severely limited by his state of mind. Do what you have to do!\n\nAlso, I'm concerned by his behaviours. It's possible he's sliding into mental illness. If you're still friends on some level could you alert his friends/family?", "You're paying half his mortgage and he has ridiculous rules for you living there, besides the wear and tear that your purchases are acquiring from his usage?", "NTA, for your own mental health you should move. This is his problem, leave him and let him deal with it.", "NTA. Run. This is just going to keep getting worse. I agree with the others that moving back home and being able to unwind after work will be heavenly!", "Um, but it\u2019s fine if he breaks your stuff? No, he is possibly not well suited for his job, but that\u2019s not your responsibility to fix for him, and leaving may be a wake up for him.", "yeah, it's hard, believe me, it was so hard, I finally Saif screw it and while she was away I moved everything with the help of some friends and blocked her and her parents (they were the owners). thankfully, this was during the start of covid, so I could use that as an excuse if they tried to take me to court, but there was no rental agreement or lease holding me there. start looking, there are other roommate finding apps to use to find a new place if the parents doesn't work out.", "NTA and I hope moving goes smoothly!\n\nHopefully post updates as you get out/get settled/if Chaz confronts you, etc?", "Chaz does not sound like a decent best friend. He sounds like a user.", "NTA. \n\nTell him you are looking to move out. Add to his stress. And speak around yourself about the situation. Stop to be a nice guy, respect yourself !", "NTA. Run from that controlling jerk as fast as you can.", "I was living in a similarly controlling situation eight months ago, I was paying half of everything and still had to ask to bring guests, my roommate brought in a dog without asking me etc, could not be happier to leave that place and live alone now. He still messages me bitching about random shit like me getting ad mail that I never signed up for, and asking me to stop as if I can control that or care enough.", "NTA. Get out of there and suggest your friend get the professional help he desperately needs.", "If he is stressing now I would move things quickly. He may resort to destroying them. \nGood luck OP, I hope you have a positive future!", "Give those items to anyone but Chaz please!", "^^^^THIS", "Take the new job and move in with your parents! You got this.", "I just want to say that you sound like an incredible person! Arranging a secret support group for him, in spite of your current difficulties with him, is just such an amazing thing to do! There needs to be more people like you in this world. Good luck with everything, and no matter what you decide to do with your living situation and career I hope you're always happy.", "May I please give you an advice as an internet stranger? Have a U-Haul or whatever movers rental truck you can get there ready on a weekend. Get a couple of friends or maybe hire a couple of people and move everything you own out of that place in one go. Let him watch if he must.\n\nTwo things you must not do:\n\n1. Think about Chaz to such an extent that you are standing in your own way.\n\n2. Let him turn this into a confrontation.\n\nRent a storage unit or something and move out. If you can record your room after you move out, please do that.\n\nBut if you must, let him know 48 hrs in advance that you would be moving out, and pay whatever you have to pay. I have a dear friend who is being forced out by one of his roommates and the guy even threatened to call the cops on him.", "Morbid curiosity from a former caseworker perspective. Do you have any insight into why all this weirdness with the rules?  They are not reasonable and you are NTA but this well disturbing. Especially the piling your stuff up every week and saying you can't have anything on any counter ever.", "You are NTA. You pay 50% of your joint living expenses (mortgage where none of the equity belongs to you, plus utilities), but you have 0% say in any house living rules. Plus,  your friend/roommate is using your things, and damaging them. And he's negligent about repairing the necessities. He seems like a control freak.\n\nAnd if he unilaterally decided one day to kick you out, I think that (depending on the laws for the locality where you live) it's quite possible you wouldn't be able to do anything about it, even if you just paid him in the rent money the evening before (unless there are some squatters rights in your jurisdiction).", "NTA. Hire a van and move everything out in one go. \n\nThen tell everyone why.", ">Chaz\n\nNTA. Full stop.", "NTA but curious if you know what brought on the change in behavior. It seems so random!!", "NTA", "Living with people is hard, we all have our issues... I think your friend is being kinda abusive and controlling, probably because is \"his house\" so the rules don't actually apply to him. You are not obligated to live with him but I think you should make a plan, talk with him and leave for good, without slowly emptying the house...that sounds kinda immature and passive agresive lol and he needs to find a new roommate asap. I think you are NTA, he crearly is... but that doesn't make it ok to be petty/mean yourself.", "He's not a guest. He's paying rent. It's his house too", "Hey man, replying here hoping you might see it: this is one of those situations where you don't realize how bad it is until after you've gotten out. As others have said, your peace of mind at home is an enormous factor, you'll be surprised how much better everything will get. If I were you I'd take the new job and move.", "He broke the lease when he changed the rules.  Talk to someone about it.  Check into renter rights organizations.", "Frankly your roommate is being abusive and u need to get out ASAP. Pack up your belongs and just GO when he\u2019s not at home and leave a note saying all u need to say and block him on everything", "I can't see any way you're the AH in this situation. His rules are on the ridiculous side. I'm not sure how you lasted this long, most people would have snapped by now. You shouldn't have to walk around on egg shells when you're essentially contributing equally.", "NTA and get out of there as quickly as possible.\n\nIt really isn't worth hanging around to see how bad it gets. He's making it impossible for you to live there so just go.", "At this stage you\u2019ve surely decided to move out, and the next thought is how to salvage anything from the friendship.\n\nYour friend is doing \u201cnesting\u201d with his first home.  You see it often with newlyweds, but I\u2019ve seen it lots with people who have bought their first house.  They become temporarily insane.\n\nThe friends who were \u201cafflicted\u201d with this eventually calmed down, but none of them ever looked back and realized how bizarre they had been behaving - they all remembered themselves as being perfectly reasonable!", "NTA. You need to get out of this situation ASAP. Take everything that belongs to you before he can destroy them more. Do it when he\u2019s not there if you must. Do it so you don\u2019t have to pay another month of rent and utility too, if possible. He brought this on himself and you can easily explain so if he asks. But I\u2019d just cut the guy outta my life if I was you.\n\nEdit: I read some more comments and if you\u2019re worried about mental health of his or remaining a friend then you certainly can\u2019t do what I said lol, as it would be quite petty if you wanted to keep a relationship.", "NTA\n\nfuck him up, if possible (no contract signed or anything like that) leave without any notice", "NTA. If Chaz can change your agreements that easily, then I assume you don't have a lease or some other form of contract with him right?  \n  \nHe is not your friend. He is using you to pay his mortgage while abusing you. Take the job offer, move away and don't waste any more time with him.", "> which would be nice to have until I get my feet off the ground.\n\nFYI: the expression is \u201cget back on your feet\u201d.", "Wait I thought you said in another comment that you didn't have a written agreement? Doesn't matter how informal you think it is do you have anything in writing pertaining to your living with Chaz?", "Quality control? Lol. Tell him the quality of his household is not meeting industry standards.", "If he can impose rules without any kind of check or review or negotiation, then you should be able to move out without any kind of check or review or negotiation. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is being totally unreasonable.", "You could rent a truck, take away ALL of your stuff and still not be TA\n\nThis dude has some control issues - and you paying 50% of the mortgage? Are you on the paperwork, or have any contract in any form?  \nIf no - you can leave today even.  \nIf you do - check for loopholes, issues, and weird stuff - and then give minimum required notice.\n\nNTA", "Also, make sure you give appropriate notice and just give him the cash for the month / months. Sometimes it\u2019s just not a fit and you deserve to love where you live, be respected and enjoy yourself.  Looks like Chaz should set your old room up as and Airbnb because he clearly doesn\u2019t want to live with someone, he just wants the check.", "NTA. The most telling is that you can't discuss the living arrangements with others. He knows he's unreasonable but doesn't want to be exposed. And exactly how will he enforce your silence?", "You are nta. You are paying top live in peace and enjoy the amenities of the rental unit.  If the other person decides to be incompatible with yourpeace of mind, you are within your moral rights to leave and take your belongings. They are yours after all.", "I was I a similar situation. I felt like I had to constantly check myself and make sure I wasn\u2019t \u201cbreaking the rules.\u201d moving out was really stressful and difficult, but I found a place, my (then girlfriend) wife moved in and we have built a good little life for ourselves. I am way less stressed, enjoy my free time, and am more productive in work and personal life. It may seem like a step back, but starting over is a good move if it makes you happier.", "You can\u2019t leave the tv remote on the table next to where you sit?  He pays rent and this AH does not get to be the dictator over the house.", "Honestly, this friendship doesn\u2019t sound like it is worth salvaging. You can appreciate the friend he USED to be, but just walk away from this mess."]}
