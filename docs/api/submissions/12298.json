I\u2019m open about it with people, my family knows what I do, I\u2019m not ashamed of it at all. I was on the verge of being homeless when I started and now just recently I was able to pay my rent for a year.\n\nI have 2 roommates. They know what I do, asked some questions about it in the beginning but they\u2019re very accepting. People in our age group don\u2019t tend to care.\n\nThe issue:\n\nI was in the kitchen making myself some dinner when my roommate(also 21f) walked in with her boyfriend. He\u2019s coming to visit for a few days. They started making themselves some food as well so we exchanged some small talk. He asked what I\u2019m studying in school and I told him that I\u2019m taking a break from school for a few months and pretty much just focusing on work. He asked what I do for work and I told him I\u2019m a stripper. He was pretty much like \u201coh cool\u201d and we moved on.\n\nI finished up and went back into my room to eat. Didn\u2019t think anything of it but I got a text from my roommate later that night. She said she \u201creally didn\u2019t appreciate me telling her bf that I\u2019m a stripper especially dressed the way I was.\u201d \n\nI was confused bc I was wearing shorts and a tank top which is what I literally always wear around the house and I also didn\u2019t know her bf was coming so it\u2019s not like I was planning it out. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she was uncomfortable but i tell anyone who asks what I do because I\u2019m not ashamed of it and I was just wearing what I normally do.\n\nShe said that \u201cI should know better than anyone what a male mind is going to imagine when they see a woman wearing revealing clothes who then says she gets naked for money.\u201d Then said that I\u2019m used to seeking out male attention.\n\nI truly didn\u2019t know how to respond and still don\u2019t, the conversation made me pretty uncomfortable and I\u2019ve pretty much just tried to stay in my room the past few days. I am aware that the nature of my job is sexual and I know that some men will \u201cfetishize\u201d me for lack of a better word. So I do understand why she\u2019d be upset about it I just don\u2019t think I did anything directly wrong?\n\nEdit: Yes I could afford to move out if I wanted to but I live in an expensive city and figured why bother because I could save more and have never had an issue with my roommates before. We all renewed our leases last month\n\nEdit 2: I live in a major city where stripping is popular and regulated.

Unfortunately your roommate is insecure. You may, but I don't, understand why she'd be upset. It's not like you were practicing in the living room. She can't control you as a roommate, nor his mind (which apparently wasn't going where she had a reason to worry). You shouldn't have to lie to appease her, or rush to change into full coverage because an unexpected guest appears.", "It sounds to me like your roommate has a problem with viewing women as objects esp when they're working in sex work, not her boyfriend or you. Majorly NTA. Your roommate should learn how to be less oppressive to women, especially considering she also identifies as a woman.", "NTA \n\nJFC, what did she expect you to do, make up a job and say that\u2019s what you worked as? \n\nShe\u2019s literally mad at you for answering a question honestly when you were asked. Wow. She seems lovely\u2026", "NTA - your roommate turned into a sudden prude because of jealousy. Her boyfriend was probably an idiot, and made some stupid comment that set her off her. I would consider this a glimpse of her true character.", "NTA. the girlfriend is mad insecure. Case closed.", "NTA", ">HE asked YOU what you did for work and you were honest. \n\nExactly, if she didn't want him to know, she should have been handling the conversation. I get the not being open to everyone bit though. I'm 42m and when I moved to the big city at 23 I was a couple blocks from a rather big strip club in a town full of them, a few months of working up my nerve and I visited. Ended up being an absolute regular there for years until I moved across town. I just kind of treated it as a normal bar. Was friends with many of the dancers, and all of the bartenders, waitresses, bouncers, dj's and cooks. On a few occasions I went to clubs with friends from work and I just flat out distanced myself from them after seeing how they treated, spoke to and thought of dancers. I mean, I was *sickened* by how they looked down on women that were my *friends* and were just doing a job that they mostly found fun and paid the bills..\n\n So yeah, you never know how someone's going to act so I wouldn't be surprised if the roommate's boyfriend revealed an absolutely disgusting side of himself after OP left the room so the roommate is blaming OP instead of blaming the boyfriend or herself for her judgement.\n\nNTA OP, but I would consider roommates boyfriend be marked as a tentative on your creep list.", "This. OP, I would text your roommate, \"I've been thinking long and hard about what you said to me, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable having your BF in my home. I've told many men what I do, and none of them have treated me differently. But if you feel that your BF is some kind of pervert who can't hear about my profession, see me in shorts and a tank top, and not picture me naked... this is a problem. Are you worried he's going to assault me? Stalk me? What if our other roommate says something that arouses him, are we safe in our home? I've never met a woman who throught her BF was this unsafe to be around other women. I think we might need to have a meeting among the roommates and decide what to do about this predator. Or, I can talk to your BF and let him know what you said and that I'm no longer comfortable having him here. Or maybe both. We can discuss this as roommates and then address the situation with him. Actually, that's probably what's best.\"\n\nWatch how fast she backtracks when you turn this around on her BF and say you'll address it with him. Chances are he didn't care, but she'll look crazy for what she said.", "I\u2019m a spiteful person with some anger issues.

Wait, there are really women who take their clothes off for money? I thought that was just fiction in movies! I am now seriously in lust with you and will never look at my girlfriend again!\"\n\nRiiiiight....", "Wtf?! What a disgraceful comment.", "Ha!! The truth is not appreciated. What the fuck??!", "You mean the men who openly and willingly walk into the club, openly and willingly open their wallets and pay for such entertainment?!", "It's not just trust. It's the whole mindset that men think like that. which is problematic for a number of reason, but one of which is that it gives men cover for thinking like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Guess some people do find it to be a big deal still...but defiantly NTA.", "Don't. That would be giving in to her idiocy. It's your home, dress in a way that makes you comfortable. If she wants to take issue with it, that's her problem, not yours.", "LoL, after spending 5 years at a club in my neighborhood as my regular bar, I hear that. Sitting at the bar talking with some of the girls between sets and my bartender, glance down, brain goes \"oh, hey, boobs.\" glance goes back up, conversation about politics or the previous episode of Angel continues.\n\nYou know how some guys let loose with the misogyny and lesser being attitude when around strippers though? I'd be wondering if after you left the room, if he said something that seriously disturbed her and she's making it your fault that she's dating a man who thinks sex workers are sex dolls or drug addicts or whatever. It's like the cattiness of the dressing room times 500x when it's a non dancer blaming a dancer for her bf's behavior. uhg.", "It\u2019s just boobs,what\u2019s the big deal? When two people are in a relationship like ours,the main things you share are in the head and the heart. So what if somebody sees the shell she walks around in?

My advice would be is to invest that money into yourself so when your natural time limit is up you have something to fall back on.", "NTA.

My child and wife will both text me to say \"Home in ten minutes...BRINGING A FRIEND HOME\" to let me know that I have to put on a shirt and pants.", "I think it might be more that she's scared that bf will find OP more attractive than her...because OP gets naked and stuff.", "I\u2019ve made 6 figures this past year.
