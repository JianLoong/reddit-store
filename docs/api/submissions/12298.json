I\u2019m open about it with people, my family knows what I do, I\u2019m not ashamed of it at all. I was on the verge of being homeless when I started and now just recently I was able to pay my rent for a year.\n\nI have 2 roommates. They know what I do, asked some questions about it in the beginning but they\u2019re very accepting. People in our age group don\u2019t tend to care.\n\nThe issue:\n\nI was in the kitchen making myself some dinner when my roommate(also 21f) walked in with her boyfriend. He\u2019s coming to visit for a few days. They started making themselves some food as well so we exchanged some small talk. He asked what I\u2019m studying in school and I told him that I\u2019m taking a break from school for a few months and pretty much just focusing on work. He asked what I do for work and I told him I\u2019m a stripper. He was pretty much like \u201coh cool\u201d and we moved on.\n\nI finished up and went back into my room to eat. Didn\u2019t think anything of it but I got a text from my roommate later that night. She said she \u201creally didn\u2019t appreciate me telling her bf that I\u2019m a stripper especially dressed the way I was.\u201d \n\nI was confused bc I was wearing shorts and a tank top which is what I literally always wear around the house and I also didn\u2019t know her bf was coming so it\u2019s not like I was planning it out. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she was uncomfortable but i tell anyone who asks what I do because I\u2019m not ashamed of it and I was just wearing what I normally do.\n\nShe said that \u201cI should know better than anyone what a male mind is going to imagine when they see a woman wearing revealing clothes who then says she gets naked for money.\u201d Then said that I\u2019m used to seeking out male attention.\n\nI truly didn\u2019t know how to respond and still don\u2019t, the conversation made me pretty uncomfortable and I\u2019ve pretty much just tried to stay in my room the past few days. I am aware that the nature of my job is sexual and I know that some men will \u201cfetishize\u201d me for lack of a better word. So I do understand why she\u2019d be upset about it I just don\u2019t think I did anything directly wrong?", "created_utc": 1678844547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ri77g/aita_for_telling_my_roommates_bf_that_im_a/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's the one with the problem. \n\n1) You pay rent to live there. You're an equal tenant who's allowed to dress in shorts and a tank top in your own home. \n\n2) You were dressed decently and didn't know her bf was coming over and even if she had told you, why should you dress any differently? You can't control what he (or anyone else, for that matter) thinks. \n\n3) HE asked YOU what you did for work and you were honest. Were you supposed to lie? F that! You have nothing to be ashamed about. You make an honest living. She's the AH.", "Oh, the audacity of being honest and comfortable in your own skin! Truly scandalous. Let's cut to the chase, shall we?\n\nYou, dear poster, are NTA. You were asked a direct question about your work, and you answered honestly. You're not ashamed of your profession, and you have every right to be open about it. What's more, you were dressed in your usual comfy attire in your own home. Newsflash: people wear shorts and tank tops! Shocking, I know.\n\nYour roommate, on the other hand, seems to have some insecurities that she's projecting onto you. Her claims about \"what a male mind is going to imagine\" and accusing you of seeking male attention are not only presumptuous but also offensive. She's trying to police your behavior based on her own discomfort, which is not fair to you.\n\nSo, keep your head held high and keep doing you. You're not responsible for her assumptions or the reactions of others to your honesty. Hopefully, she'll come around and realize she's overreacting. If not, it might be time for a heart-to-heart to clear the air, set some boundaries, and ensure everyone feels respected in your shared living space.", "NTA. He *asked* you, it wasn't as if you just walked up to him and happily volunteered that information. Besides, what were you supposed to do? Lie about it? I think your roommate must have some kind of insecurity within her relationship", "NTA. Her boyfriend knows strippers exist. If he wanted to get a lap dance he could any night of the week. If she thinks meeting one in real life- one who isn\u2019t even interested in him- is going to mess with their relationship, then she not only has no respect for what you do, but she has no respect for him either.", "NTA. You should ask her what lie you're supposed to tell the next person to make her comfortable and watch her not be able to respond with a legit answer. If you don't answer the question, people will think you're doing something illegal or under the table for work and you probably don't want that. It's your job. She can get over it. If she thinks her boyfriend is going to make a move on you because he knows your profession, she either needs to reevaluate her relationship or some insecurity issues.", "NTA. He asked, and other women's insecurities are not your problem. News flash for your roommate: if he wanted to picture you naked, he was going to do it whether you told him you were a stripper or a porta-potty technician.", "NTA.  You were asked a question and gave an honest answer.  No way you were wrong here.", "NTA.  He asked a question and you answered it.  She should have given you a heads up that she was going to bring company around.  Don't let her project her insecurities on to you.\n\nTell her to give you a heads up when she has company coming over so you can dress accordingly (if you want to), other than that, you are not going to hide who you are for anyone.", "NTA. You pay rent, you were in no way indecently dressed and you had neither cause nor reason to lie about your profession. Your roommate needs to take a look inwards and reevaluate some of her life choices: she\u2019s chosen to have no moral opposition to your choice of profession yet she chooses to blame you for her boyfriends imagined fantasying about you.

People in our age group don\u2019t tend to care.\n\nThis roommate is \"accepting\" in a vacuum, and only there. And this girl acts like she doesn't care, but that's only the surface.  Ultimately she *does care* deeply. And you've learned the hard way that she is insecure and will see any action as a lure to steal her crusty boyfriend.  You as a threat to her and the moment you *wore clothes in your own home, while cooking for yourself, and answered a few basic questions to the guy thats balling her... (gasp!) she had your number.* \n\nThis chick sux and is a mess of hang ups and is not your ally. I would keep a wide bearth and avoid sharing sensitive info with her, people like this are gunning to \"expose\" you because they can't reconcile you being a good person and working in the sex industry.  \n\nYou are NTA, and I hope she figures her shit out or she gtfo.", "Nta ask her how she thinks you should have responded. There was no other way", "NTA\nShe\u2019s obviously insecure and taking it out on you which isn\u2019t cool. He asked what you, you answered.

I even took a couple of guys with me when she worked one night (after she said it was fine,of course.) \n\n I noticed,oddly enough,that I got more judgemental disapproval from females than males. Guys would make foul jokes here and there,but some gals would get low-key upset that I would be in a relationship with her.

Is there any focus required? Because that led to the next question, right? We say focus on work in terms of learning new skills or gaining new knowledge that keeps us relevant in the workplace. In this instance, I am assuming you need to be fit and do your workouts to stay in shape, and maybe shave your legs... Something people do anyway. So I guess an answer could be that you are a student but have taken a break at the moment. This is not about being ashamed of what you do, but seems like he was simply making small talk the way we do with a new person, but you led him to ask what you do with the comment about being focused on work right now. You need no more focus on stripping than you need waitressing. Outside of the hours you put in, you are not spending time honing your skills.", "NTA.
