He\u2019s coming to visit for a few days. They started making themselves some food as well so we exchanged some small talk. He asked what I\u2019m studying in school and I told him that I\u2019m taking a break from school for a few months and pretty much just focusing on work. He asked what I do for work and I told him I\u2019m a stripper. He was pretty much like \u201coh cool\u201d and we moved on.\n\nI finished up and went back into my room to eat. Didn\u2019t think anything of it but I got a text from my roommate later that night. She said she \u201creally didn\u2019t appreciate me telling her bf that I\u2019m a stripper especially dressed the way I was.\u201d \n\nI was confused bc I was wearing shorts and a tank top which is what I literally always wear around the house and I also didn\u2019t know her bf was coming so it\u2019s not like I was planning it out. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she was uncomfortable but i tell anyone who asks what I do because I\u2019m not ashamed of it and I was just wearing what I normally do.\n\nShe said that \u201cI should know better than anyone what a male mind is going to imagine when they see a woman wearing revealing clothes who then says she gets naked for money.\u201d Then said that I\u2019m used to seeking out male attention.\n\nI truly didn\u2019t know how to respond and still don\u2019t, the conversation made me pretty uncomfortable and I\u2019ve pretty much just tried to stay in my room the past few days. I am aware that the nature of my job is sexual and I know that some men will \u201cfetishize\u201d me for lack of a better word.

You're not responsible for her assumptions or the reactions of others to your honesty. Hopefully, she'll come around and realize she's overreacting.
