It's been months or year (I don't remember) since we last chatted/talked. When he asked am I free on \"insert date\", I thought we were just hanging out for a catch up so I agree to the possibility of hanging out. Literally, I just said I'm ok if there's no OT work that day. I wanted to get a breather from my work.\n\nFurther into the IG conversation, I realized he was trying to hook me up with FOREX trading and attempting to sign me up to a platform. The hang out was actually a meet up with another friend of his (I don't know him btw), promoting the service like free lessons bla bla bla, you know the deal. I declined the offer because I've had 2nd hand experience with forex (my dad did it b4) and made my intention clear that I have no plan to do it and neither want to waste his friend's time. Then he proceeded with \"oh it wont hurt to just listen and try it yadayada...\". At this point, if it isn't obvious, I was already pretty disappointed and discouraged to attend it.\n\nFast forward 2 days later to the date, which is today actually, I received a dm in the morning from him reminding me of the \"hang out\" tonight. At that moment, I was already quite turned off so I just replied with \"I think I can't make it today, had to crunch work. Sorry\". Obviously, he's sour about it and went \"Bro, I already arranged everything, dont do me like that. Just make it at 9pm, it won't take long.\" I reminded him that I made it clear I had no intention to do trading and I was just open to the possibility to hang out, and no can't make it at 9pm. No reply afterwards.\n\nI'm aware that I'm flushing this relationship into the drain (gut feeling) but I really don't want to sit for a sales pitch when I just wanna hang out with a friend that I have not got in touch with in months.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1681279800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jc8hd/aita_for_calling_off_a_hang_out_which_was_a/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
