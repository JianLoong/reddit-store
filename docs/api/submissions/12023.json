My wife (23) is in maternity leave, I (m24) on the other hand am working a office job. I work from 7 to 12 so six hours in the morning, and then my boss accommodated my schedule so I can work two more hours from home to be with my family (1pm to 3pm). \n\nGiven this arrangement my wife and I decided that she was gonna do the baby feeding during the night, I feed him and take care of him before going to work, then she obviously takes care of him while I'm at work, I take care of him after I get home, we switch the bathe time or we do it together (depending on how tired we are) and I put him to sleep. I think this is a good arrangement, we both have equal work and break time. When I'm taking care of the baby she can do whatever she likes, she can go nap, go out, whatever. I do some of the night feedings during weekends.\n\nWell she asked me two days ago to start doing some of the night feedings too. She says she's tired because she can't sleep enough/ well during the night. I refused because I have to wake up quite early to work and I need to be well rested at work. I told her I won't mind doing it if I wake up anyway, like if the baby is crying or she accidentally wakes me up while getting up, but that's hardly gonna happen because I'm a deep sleeper. I told her she can nap when I get home so she's well rested, but she says she tried but is not used to napping.  I stood my ground and said I can't do more than I already do.\n\nWe're in a tight spot, she's not giving me the cold shoulder or any like that, but I can tell she's angry at me. I understand that she's tired and we're both still getting used to being a parent, but we spoke about the arrangement before to avoid this kind of argument. AITA?

Do you know what happens when you're too tired for that? My husband once almost dropped our 6-months-old from the couch before he was diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Babies can DIE when their caregiver is too tired. Their mothers can literally lose their minds when overwhelmed, and your wife is sending out an SOS to you! \n\nI'm a mother of twins. My husband was on paternity leave for the first two months of their life, and he had the \"night shift\" from 10pm to 4am, and I STILL cried from exhaustion during the day, because guess what, a nap (which, according to the \"schedule\" you mention, can't last over 3 hours) doesn't replace night sleep. How long does your wife sleep in one go? \n\nWhen do you go to bed? Do you still fill your evenings with whatever you do in your free time? Because you've got to get your priorities right and adjust your free time to your child's and your wife's NEEDS, not your WANTS.\n\nIf you get up early, you can take over early to late evening so your wife can sleep then, UNDISTURBED. After she's had UNDISTURBED sleep for more than 5 hours, then you can take your turn.\n\nTry switching what your wife and you are doing over the next weekend, see how much weight she's lifting on her own!", "I\u2019ve never had a kid so I\u2019m hesitant to say this, but respectfully YTA imo. \nIt\u2019s more about your wife\u2019s health, humans need sleep and she\u2019s asking for help. The least you can do is communicate your concerns, and give it a try. Just do one or two nights a week, on days you know your workload is lighter. She has already put so much work into creating this child, and she has had no time to truly rest in the 8 weeks since then, if she\u2019s the only one night feeding.", "You decided things were going to be a certain way. Cool. \n\nBabies don\u2019t follow your plans. You both underestimated what a toll having an infant would take. The goal posts have shifted. And now you need to compromise. \n\nYou\u2019re being cruel and transactional about this. \n\nYTA", "YTA for saying you need to be well rested. No you don't. You need to take care of your baby whether it leaves you rested or tired. She has to take care of him from 7am- 3pm, no matter if she's tired from watching him all night, correct? She doesn't get to be well rested, does she? You think no parents ever went to work tired?", "YTA. She's doing the night feedings, then again during the day while you are at work. When do you think she's going to get sleep or a break? The few hours you pick up?  A newborn is BOTH your responsibility.  You don't get a pass because you go to work. Being a mother is extremely taxing on our bodies after birth. And your worried about a few lost hours at night so she can get some much deserved and needed rest. You are so very selfish.", "NTA.  Could you do a little more? Maybe but you\u2019re also coming home early to help and your boss already accommodated you.  If it\u2019s this bad for your wife you may need to talk about a nanny or family coming to help a couple days so your wife can rest (or at night if you trust them)\n\nPeople here are quick to \u201cwhite knight\u201d though.  Apparently everyone else\u2019s job is a cake walk so you get labeled as having a break from responsibilities by going to work and everyone has enough money in the bank to have both people just stop working.", "YTA. Why do you need to be fully rested for work, but she doesn\u2019t need to be fully rested for her work (keeping your child alive and thriving)?\n\nI highly recommend you look into how many infant deaths occur when the primary caregiver doesn\u2019t get enough sleep. \n\nYour wife is telling you that the shifts y\u2019all have set up aren\u2019t working for her, she canNOT get enough sleep to be a safe caregiver to your child. \n\nWhy can\u2019t *you* start your sleep shift at 3:30pm when you get off work? 3:30-10:30 is a great stretch of sleep; you could wake up, shower, get a meal in, let your wife sleep from midnight to 6:30am, and then head off to work. \n\nFirst 4 months of baby\u2019s life is a shifts game. You need to be flexible to everyone\u2019s needs because the main focus is that baby you chose to bring into this world.", "NAH - everyone is talking about if they can do it then so can you but parenting differs for everyone, what works for someone else won\u2019t necessarily work for you, and vice-versa.\n\nI just think this is something you both need to discuss with each other, instead of trying to prove why the other person has it harder, try and see one another perspective and reason with each other. She needs to \u2018learn to nap\u2019 instead of acting like it\u2019s a huge inconvenience to do and you need to learn that what may have worked at the beginning won\u2019t necessarily work now- you both need to let go of that stubbornness. \n\nI\u2019m sure you have a day or two off from work in a week? You could maybe do the night times on those days. I understand that she can get extra hours of sleep during the day but when you\u2019ve been sleeping at night your whole life, thats not something you can easily adjust to. Neither of you are in the wrong (despite the comments stating otherwise).\n\nAlso congratulations on the baby!", "YTA - why did you have a child you did not want? you think that your obligations are more important than caring for YOUR CHILD AND WIFE!?", "YTA BOTH of you are the parents. It's just not you working hard your wife is too. Just because she's not working her job doesn't mean she's not working hard. She needs her sleep as much as you. You need to compromise so it's not all on her during the nights.", "YTA- why cant you be the one that naps in the afternoon?", "Maybe you can do the nighttime feedings during weekends?", "YTA. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause you have a newborn and you're already skirting responsibility. Suck it up. You didn't just hold a child in you for 10 months and push it out a small hole. \n\nGrow a set, be a father, and stop expecting this and that for a job that is already very accommodating\n\nDid you expect having a child was going to be a cakewalk? If so you already fucked up", "YTA. Your wife is also working full time during the day, taking care of an 8 week old infant. Splitting nighttime feedings is fair.", "YTA. Do your turn and help your wife and the mother of your child. You\u2019re a parent for crying out loud. Act like one", "YTA... step up and PARENT.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA for your attitude towards her request. Being able to \u201cnap\u201d when the baby does during the day (if even possible) isn\u2019t the same as sleeping through the night as a heavy sleeper. If you do \u201csome\u201d of them on the weekends (but not all) and none during the work week, she\u2019s never getting a night off. \n\nPlease don\u2019t underestimate the mental break of going to work. Your work is important. It helps pay the bills. There is nothing wrong with wanting to arrive well rested. Your job may be easy or insanely stressful. Either way, it\u2019s normal to not want to be exhausted. But you need to keep in mind, your well rested sleep is coming at her expense, EVERY SINGLE TIME. You do no nights solo based on your posts. So in addition to her hormones crashing and recovering from childbirth, she hasn\u2019t had any solid night of sleep. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest, sometimes it just sucks when a baby is little. Sometimes one parent shares a vastly disproportionate share of the burden. And sometimes that\u2019s the most logical way to operate. But it\u2019s on the partner who gets to sleep and leave the house to be more understanding and sympathize with the one who doesn\u2019t. \n\nBut please don\u2019t think coming home from your office job after getting a full night of sleep and bathing the baby and putting them to bed and doing \u201csome\u201d night stuff on weekends means you\u2019re splitting parenting 50/50 right now. Again, it\u2019s not always possible to do a 50/50 split. But you certainly shouldn\u2019t act like you\u2019re doing all you can. You are doing all you WANT. That is different. You don\u2019t want to be tired. Neither does she. But your arrangement is that she is always tired and you might be a little tired on the weekends. Please don\u2019t minimize her feelings and consider finding ways to help more than you are.\n\nAnd for anyone wondering, holding someone to hypothetical agreements before the baby is here is insane.", "I wouldn\u2019t say Y T A but it sounds like you\u2019re not hearing her. She is exhausted and however much you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t enough. She needs to get some solid sleep. My ex was very proud of himself for how we split everything in childcare as 50/50 in his estimate. But it was 50/50 from 7am to 7pm only. You\u2019re doing more than that. But I can tell you I begged for help overnight from him and he would not budge. And I could never really forgive him for it (I\u2019ll add that I was the main breadwinner and this went on after my 12 weeks of mat leave for the first year of our child\u2019s life\u2014zero help overnight, zero bath time. Just checked out at 7pm. Later on couples therapy tried to gaslight me and say he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. It was insane. So glad I unloaded that dead weight)", "YTA naps isn't a nights rest which is what she needs and is asking for. She literally asking for help and you're selfishly and blatantly saying no. Birth and being a mom isn't easy and it's not the same as being a dad. You're work ends and you get to rest and sleep pretty much every night. Her job is 24/7 and she's on her 8th week of not being allowed to sleep a full night. You try living off only naps and \"breaks\" that's not restful and it doesnt help as much as actually getting to sleep for a while night. I feel so bad for her, she came to you asking for help from her husband/the man she chose to have a child with and he is flat out refusing. If you're not as tired as your wife (which you're not don't lie that poor woman sounds exhausted) then you're not doing enough. You're job isn't to just work it's to provide and that means providing her with the support she needs since she's doing the brunt of the work. You can't help her out even a little? You're not even covering nights half the week! Babies are such a full time job and you obviously do not understand that. Dont be an AH, don't argue, just help your wife.", "YTA. You wife is not getting QUALITY sleep. Her body is not only recovering from pregnancy and birth, it's re- setting to a new hormonal normal. She is exhausted. All the time.\n\nThat baby is 100% the responsibility of BOTH parents. You seem to think it's her job and you are magnanimously helping her. When convenient for you.\n\nYou had better change your attitude pretty quick before PPD kicks in.", "In what world do you work equal amounts and have an equal amount of breaks?\n\nDo you get 6-9 hours of restful, uninterrupted sleep? Appears you do. When exactly does your wife get this? At 8 weeks your wife could be getting up with baby every 2 hours and be up for  anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, or more. So at best your wife is getting maybe 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep at a time. There is no way she is getting the same amount of rest and sleep as you. \n\nShe\u2019s also keeping a small human alive. Gonna guess your job is no where near this taxing and stressful. Not to mention how emotionally and physically draining it is with a newborn, especially when you\u2019re not getting any sort of restful time. So how is it that YOU need an entire night of sleep for your job but you expect your wife to literally look after your newborn child with nothing more than 3 hours of sleep and naps? \n\nYTA", "YTA", "NTA You are working full time, she isn't.", "YTA welcome to parenthood :)", "YTA- you may be at work but she\u2019s taking care of that baby ALL day also.

If your wife is not nursing, then maybe pick two nights a week when you will get up with the baby and she can sleep in a different room and get quality sleep.  It will significantly help her.", "YTA. It doesn't matter how tired or sleep deprived I am, I have never been able to nap during the day. Some people are just like that. Sounds like your wife hasn't slept in eight weeks. Being sleep deprived is just part of being a new parent, but one parent should not be taking on all the night time sleep deprivation. Yes, you'll be really tired if you have to wake up at night with the baby. Every parent of a new child is really tired, even if they have to go to work. That's just part of the baby deal.", "YTA solely because you downright \u201crefused.\u201d Real partners don\u2019t refuse each other\u2019s requests for help, they find a way to help each other.", "YTA.

Otherwise we split the nights pretty 50/50.\n\nYou work in an office, you can afford to be tired. She's not asking you to do all of the night, just some of. Having a new baby is fucking exhausting, her body is still recovering, her hormones will be all over the place!\n\nMy partner and I also discussed arrangements beforehand to avoid arguments and guess what?

They can be adjusted and worked around to help everyone feel better. Your wife has just had a baby. You did not have the baby. She would also need more rest because of that. Why so rigid? Sounds like you signed some sort of contract detailing all this. Work with her. See what's happening with her. She's your wife, not your bloody opponent.", "NTA\n\nWhen my husband worked I did the night feedings even though I worked at home running a daycare. \n\nI went to bed around 8 or 9 and he stayed up and did any feedings until midnight.", "This is really just a damned if you do damned if you don\u2019t kind of a situation it seems. I would say try out some night feedings, throw her a bone and see how it feels vs. resistant to that change\u2014 it seems as though it\u2019s going to be a process of figuring out what is sustainable for you both as individuals and as partners. I can understand feeling burnt out from this entire thing and being worried about not being well rested for work. Really just sounds like a frustrating situation for both of you. But yes, I would say being willing to sacrifice a little more of your rest to give her some relief in this situation could go a long way between you and be worth it in the long run. The balance of give and take isn\u2019t always going to be 100% equal based on upon one another\u2019s capacity and sometimes you have to give a little more. But no one is the asshole here, just humans struggling to get by the best they can.", "YTA. In the 8 weeks since having this baby your wife has been HEALING. Are you aware of what her body has gone through to have this baby? She needs rest and needs to heal properly. It took me 9 months to heal after my first baby and it was HELL. I notice you don't say how baby is fed either. Is she also breastfeeding and needs to keep up her food and water intake?", "NAH. Your wife is struggling and asking for help. You are acknowledging her ask and offering alternatives. New babies are hard and there is a reason sleep deprivation is used as a form of torture. It sounds like you guys are both contributing and communicating. That is usually the hardest part to establish.", "NTA", "YTA. Suffering baby, that's what you both signed up for. If it becomes an issue of losing your job/income, that's another question. Days and nights are sweet and brutal for first time parents. Don't ever try to compare your experience to a new mother. Just make it work.", "YTA. \n\nFirst, if the current agreement sounded great on paper, but isn't working--then you need to reevaluate what to do. You two have never done this before, so having a plan not work out when implemented isn't surprising.\n\nSleep deprivation is literally torture. At not-quite-2- months, your wife is still recovering from childbirth; there's a reason civilized countries have longer maternity leave, extending up to a year or more, as well as why spacing pregnancies by at least 18 months between the end of one pregnancy & the start of another--the drain on the body is much heavier than people usually can see. \n\nSecond, **not everyone naps well or at all.** I can only nap when I am seriously ill or recovering from a major event (like surgery). Otherwise, I either can't sleep, or if I do sleep, I feel worse afterwards, like I'm hungover or sick--almost like a migraine (headache, overheated, queasy). My husband naps easily and always has. People can learn to nap under certain circumstances, but while she's also recovering from childbirth is not ideal.\n\nHaving her wake up in the night, and then take the baby 7-3 is too much if she doesn't already have an established napping pattern. It just doesn't work, sorry. \n\nPerhaps you two can split the overnight duty so that she gets the baby earlier, you get the baby later (pick a time)--and you need to go to bed earlier at night to accommodate that shift.\n\nNo, you are not going to get much time together. The first few months to a year are a slog.

It is hard having a baby and getting up EVERYTIME for feedings.  Your wife deserves a break at least one or two nights a week in order to catch up on sleep & be the best mother possible. So if you cant manage to be sleepy one or two days a week, you need to bring in resources to care for the baby at least 2 nights a week, whether they are family, friends, or paid nighttime babysitter.  If you cant pay help and have no friends or family, you need to take the night shift at least on the weekend (fri & sat night) to give your wife a break .\n\nThe good news is that this is temporary and most babies are mostly sleeping thru the night by 6 months", "YTA.

I was madly sleep deprived the first few weeks with my son, but no way in hell I'd ask the dad that had to work to take care of him at night.

Not sleeping all night is terrible and can add up over time (and naps don't work and not all people do well with napping).

While this sounds extreme, it\u2019s true. What if your wife fell asleep nursing the baby and they fell off the bed, or she rolled into them in her sleep? Your wife is asking for your help, you need to compromise here for the sake of her and your child.

My wife (23) is in maternity leave, I (m24) on the other hand am working a office job. I work from 7 to 12 so six hours in the morning, and then my boss accommodated my schedule so I can work two more hours from home to be with my family (1pm to 3pm). \n\nGiven this arrangement my wife and I decided that she was gonna do the baby feeding during the night, I feed him and take care of him before going to work, then she obviously takes care of him while I'm at work, I take care of him after I get home, we switch the bathe time or we do it together (depending on how tired we are) and I put him to sleep. I think this is a good arrangement, we both have equal work and break time. When I'm taking care of the baby she can do whatever she likes, she can go nap, go out, whatever. I do some of the night feedings during weekends.\n\nWell she asked me two days ago to start doing some of the night feedings too. She says she's tired because she can't sleep enough/ well during the night. I refused because I have to wake up quite early to work and I need to be well rested at work. I told her I won't mind doing it if I wake up anyway, like if the baby is crying or she accidentally wakes me up while getting up, but that's hardly gonna happen because I'm a deep sleeper. I told her she can nap when I get home so she's well rested, but she says she tried but is not used to napping.  I stood my ground and said I can't do more than I already do.\n\nWe're in a tight spot, she's not giving me the cold shoulder or any like that, but I can tell she's angry at me. I understand that she's tired and we're both still getting used to being a parent, but we spoke about the arrangement before to avoid this kind of argument. AITA? What can we do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But because of this, my husband would go to sleep early so he could take baby from 5am until the next feeding so I could stay in bed and get several more hours of sleep. That was way more helpful to me than having a nap later in the afternoon, when often I\u2019d spend most of that time trying to fall asleep and then not actually getting much extra rest at all.

Are you waking up when the baby does on those nights, or does she have to wake you up, which means she is already awake? To give her two good nights of sleep, you might need to move into the baby\u2019s room, sleep on an air mattress, to make sure your wife gets solid consecutive hours. And then the last question, can you add one night during the work week? Can you take a Tuesday or Wednesday night?
