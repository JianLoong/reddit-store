His daughter will someday see the tree and feel loved", "NTA\n\nHe has a baby! Does he expect to just get rid of that? \n\nMaybe the family can hire an arborist to graft on a branch where his carving is, or do something else to remove it that wouldn\u2019t kill the tree.", "NTA and the fact that this even was suggested is insane.\n\nIt\u2019s also unbelievable that your parents didn\u2019t just say \u201cno, we are not chopping down a hundred year old tree just because you can\u2019t keep it in your pants\u201d and instead punted the choice to their underage children.\n\nTell your brother that his shame isn\u2019t in the tree.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with your brother? Besides being a cheater, that is. He done fucked up, big time, now he wants the entire family to pay because he couldn't keep it in his pants. I get it, he's embarrassed by his discretion (I hope) but maybe he needs this to be a reminder not to be such a dick. Nope. Tree stands. Tell him if he so much harms even one leaf on that tree, you'll see him in court.", "NTA. You're brother needs to learn that there are consequences for our actions. The tree is a reflection of lives lived and we don't always get things right the first time.", "NTA he is being selfish, he was selfish for cheating and selfish for wanting a tradition to end because of his mistakes. Also your parents are kinda AH for pushing the decision on you instead of putting their foot down so they don\u2019t have to take the blame. Honestly I wonder if the brother is gonna show up with a chainsaw when no one is home because he seems incapable to accepting fault.", "NTA For the love of god simply solve this by putting something over the carving. Heard of wood putty? Brown, out-door caulk?", "NTA it's not the trees fault that your brother is an idiot.  Maybe no one else carves up this tree until their 20th wedding anniversary....or not at all\n\nEdited to add, cover his name up with a sign or something that says \"op last name family tree\"", "NTA. I don't really think that the family tradition is important here. It is weird to cut down a tree because of one sign that actually could be cut out. \n\nIf he is afraid that the tree will still remind him, basically new tree will too, and of course recarving will not be made with grandparents hands, he is TA", "NTA, get a sign made with just the Neice\u2019s name and put it over it. Your brother needs to take it down a notch. Irrational decisions much.", "NTA He wants to kill a whole tree and an irreplaceable family momento because he doesn\u2019t want to be reminded of someone he already has a kid with? He sure can\u2019t feed the kid into a wood chipper, so he will ALWAYS have a reminder of this relationship.", "NTA\n\nYour brother just doesn't want to be reminded about him being a shitty person. That's not your or the tree's problem. He shouldn't have cheated in the first place.", "They aren\u2019t together any more, but they still created a wonderful person together. Let the carving stand for that. Also, he shouldn\u2019t get to ruin it for everyone else. NTA.", "NTA BUT your brother sure is. I think it is lovely to have this family tree and tradition. Keep the tree. It sounds as if your brother has a lot of growing up to do.", "NTA. The tree stays. Your brother is an AH who wants to destroy a family tradition because he couldn't keep his pants zipped. Keep the tree. Your brother can kick rocks...", "I'd cut off the brother instead and ban him from the property.", "NTA. Save the tree. You can cover up your brother's name, or etch it out. But keep the tree definitely", "So because he screwed up he gets to decide the tree comes down? Nope, he needs to love with the consequences of his actions. Just because he got her pregnant didn't mean they were a forever couple. Unless the tree is sick I wouldn't do it. He can take his entitlement and put it where the sun never shines.", "NTA.

Your brother was wrong and he messed up his own life and now he wants everyone else to pay for his bad decisions. Don\u2019t let him bully you and your sister. It\u2019s a beautiful family tradition and you and your sister deserve the chance to add your initials. I can\u2019t believe how selfish your brother is being. Tell that man to grow up and get it together.", "NTA, he should always be reminded of his cheating", "Oh hell he just doesn't want to explain to the next/new girl. Tell him 'Tradition' above being a DUMBASS. He doesn't get to decide!  I doubt chopping down the tree ever crossed your grandparents mind for the only reason is that he could not keep his pants zipped. Hand his next gf some super glue... just in case.", "NTA. Tell your brother to grow up", "Nta... sweet tradition... but just because he screwed up doesn't mean the tradition has to stop.  He can live with the consequences (therefore the reminder when he sees the tree)", "NTA\n\nShe had his kid. She's permanently connected to the family.", "NTA chopping down the tree for his indiscretions is a terrible idea. Keep it up to remind him to do better", "NTA keep the tree, and in addition to initials in a tree he also has a child to remind him of the relationship. Tell him if he does not want to see the initials to blind himself.", "NTA. \"terrible people\" says the cheater!\n\nHe can simply not look at the tree. He is self-centered and selfish.", "NTA.  Your brother is probably not himself right now.  I suggest you tell him a decision won\u2019t be made right now and you will talk about it again in six months.  Let him have a chance to change his mind.  You can say no again then too.  Just let him have some space and time.  Ideally, he makes a different decision and there\u2019s a bit more dignity in that for him.", "NTA. He obviously carved his name WAY too young, made a huge mistake, and now wants to punish everyone else for it. He made the mistake, thus he needs to live with it, with or without the tree. As a compromise, you can take a dremel to the area they carved their names/initials, maybe even make a fancy design, and save that area for him to re-carve when he's older, wiser, and actually married to the love of his life. Do not cut down the tree. It's so sentimental, and I think everyone else in your family would regret it their whole lives if you did cut it down.\n\nEdited for spelling mistakes.", "NTA\nActions & decisions have consequences.  Hopefully your brother does better in the future", "NTA\n\nYour brother is the only asshole in this story.", "NTA - your cheating brother can kick rocks", "NTA. Your brother is one selfish dude. Tell him NO and leave it at that.", "NTA. You would be TA if you kill that tree and the tradition just because brother is butt-hurt about being reminded of a sore spot in his recent past.", "NTA. Bro made poor choices. He can deal with them. Can he re-carve the tree and change it to his child's name?", "It\u2019s usually at the birth of the first child (assuming they aren\u2019t child free like my aunt and uncle)! However when kids aren\u2019t involved it\u2019s usually at the 7th year because that\u2019s how long my great grandparents waited to have kids. (They chose to travel the country while they were young! They never had much, which is why this house and tree are so important to us)", "I definitely think you should keep the tree and the tradition! Just figure a way to remove or cover his because it would not be a nice thing for his forever partner (if he ever matures enough to have one) to see the exs initials on there....and he is not allowed to recarve the tree for even longer than the norm!"]}
