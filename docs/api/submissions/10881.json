Tell that man to grow up and get it together.", "NTA, he should always be reminded of his cheating", "Oh hell he just doesn't want to explain to the next/new girl. Tell him 'Tradition' above being a DUMBASS. He doesn't get to decide!  I doubt chopping down the tree ever crossed your grandparents mind for the only reason is that he could not keep his pants zipped. Hand his next gf some super glue... just in case.", "NTA. Tell your brother to grow up", "Nta... sweet tradition... but just because he screwed up doesn't mean the tradition has to stop.  He can live with the consequences (therefore the reminder when he sees the tree)", "NTA\n\nShe had his kid. She's permanently connected to the family.", "NTA chopping down the tree for his indiscretions is a terrible idea.

Having a scandal on the tree adds some spice, it's extra flavour.", "NTA. Your brother is one selfish prick. He wants to eliminate an entire families tradition for his own selfish needs.

He cheated and now he wants a whole living tree cut down because his ex-wife\u2019s name is on it?
