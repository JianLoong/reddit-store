A single user account- meaning only one user can watch at a time. My friends saw me using Netflix and they wanted me to share it with them and i did because they were struggling to find decent websites to watch movies and tv shows. But they started using it too much to a point where they used it for an entire day without a break. They continually binged shows for 8 to 9 hours at a stretch. I couldn't use it at all. And anytime i tried to use it, they called me up and told me to watch another time as they want to watch it at that moment, or try to write up a schedule for me ON MY ACCOUNT i.e., fix timings for my screen usage. I got mad and i deleted the account and bought one using a different email address and told them it was my brother's because i didn't want to hurt their feelings by directly stating the reason.

Too many young people never learn to say no. \n\nOP please understand I mean everything I\u2019m saying with kindness. Now go practice screaming NO and Screw off! Into a pillow.
