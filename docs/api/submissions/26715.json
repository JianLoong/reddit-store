Maybe give the *literal child* some grace.\n\nIts not ideal, but its not exactly the same as if OP had taken back a book or tshirt.", "Put the whole story about what mil did on social media and blast that aH and liar.\n\nNTA", "My husband is 100% on my side. We both didn\u2019t want to make a scene about it. He has called his mom and texted his family since the incident, we aren\u2019t communicating to anyone about it right now because it has been overwhelming. He had told his mom about us getting a new puppy multiple times, even invited the family over to our house for dinner so they could also meet the puppy but they had a football game to go to. (This was 2 days before her party.)", "I think she genuinely thought I would just give her the dog. In one of the many phone calls I have gotten she said \u201cyou have only had the dog for a few days it\u2019s not like you have an attachment.\u201d", "I wanted everyone to meet the puppy because they hadn\u2019t met her. There were dogs and puppies there. I didn\u2019t think about the puppy taking away attention from SIL, and I don\u2019t think she did. There were a lot of people there and everyone was talking to everyone. There were over 10 dogs/puppies there. I didn\u2019t walk in there with the puppy and all eyes came off the birthday girl. That\u2019s not what happened at all. Everyone was interacting with everyone and everyone\u2019s dogs. SIL loves animals, she comes over sometimes just to play with our other dog.", "You are totally right! I\u2019m very shy, and when my MIL announced that to everyone I was too embarrassed to tell everyone that MIL was lying. I had talked to both MIL and SIL (in private) before I took my puppy back.", "There's a whoooooole lot of brain development in those 3 years. Chill, friend.", "Your MIL would have made the scene. Not you. Please grow a backbone.", "Oh my gosh she gets worse \ud83d\ude21", "\"And SIL \"had\" the dog for even less time so she has even less of one\"", "\u2018SIL only held the dog for a few seconds. It\u2019s not like she has an attachment.\u2019", "lol just record that and send it to everyone else that asks you why you took the puppy", "MIL already has two dogs and thinks that?? Kinda worried for those other dogs too, tbh."]}
