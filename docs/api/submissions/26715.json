Everyone was petting her and playing with her. My MIL asked me if the puppy was for my SIL, I said no that this was my husband and i\u2019s puppy. (She knew that we had just gotten a new puppy.) She held the puppy for a bit and gave her back and all seemed fine. \n\nMy SIL started opening her gifts when she finally noticed the puppy in my arms and asked me if MIL had finally let her get a puppy for her 13th birthday. Before I could even say anything MIL said \u201cyes.\u201d SIL bursted into tears about \u201cfinally\u201d having a puppy and then came over to me and tried to take the puppy. I was in shock at what just happened and kinda just let her take the puppy out of my hands. Eventually I went over to my MIL and asked her wtf she was thinking. \n\nShe told me that my SIL had been asking for a puppy for years, and she said \u201cYou don\u2019t mind do you?\u201d I was taken aback, I couldn\u2019t believe my MIL just gave away my puppy without even asking me. I took my SIL over to the side and told her that the puppy was mine and I wanted her back. She started throwing a fit and literally screaming. I just took the puppy back and my husband and I left. \n\nWhen we got back home I was bombarded \nWith texts and phone calls from everyone at the party asking me why I took the puppy away from SIL. My SIL and MIL are very angry with me, and I just need to know AITA?\n\nEdit: Her birthday party was at the river, many people had brought their dogs to the party. I also did not know she had been asking MIL for a puppy, (they have two dogs.)\nEdit 2: My husband is 100% on my side. We both didn\u2019t want to make a scene about it. He has called his mom and texted his family since the incident, we aren\u2019t communicating to anyone about it right now because it has been overwhelming.

It gives your brain space to kick in and process what's happening to respond the way you want. It also forces the person to repeat themselves as a \"you sure you want to lock that in as a final answer?\" which does have big social benefits if someone is in the wrong. \n\nJust a possible future strategy", "NTA.

I read the post and instinctively huffed at the thought of a 13 year old kicking off like that... then I recall when I was 13 I wanted a parrot more than anything on this dang earth. And if I'd been that 13 Y/O's shoes, but with a parrot instead of a puppy? I'd probably have reacted the exact same way.\n\n13 year olds are going through a weird time usually and we should all give them a bit more slack rather than jumping to the idea that they should all be super mature because they're not a *small* child anymore.", "I teach 13 year olds, and they literally cry for everything.

Disappointed, even crying, sure.", "\u2026Attachment aside, I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say you paid a lot more to adopt the puppy than you\u2019d typically spend on a 13 year old\u2019s birthday gift. Did MIL think you\u2019d cheerfully give it away and then go spend the same amount of money again to get another puppy for yourselves? I mean WTF?\n\nFurthermore, why would MIL ever even assume you\u2019d bring a puppy as a gift without clearing it with her first? You don\u2019t just surprise someone with a high-maintenance animal that will need months of training.

That type of introduction isn't recommended. Socialization should happen in steps.", "Yeah I totally get that. I\u2019m probably an overprotective type, I followed the AKC reco and socialized my puppy in baby steps (exposure to stores, small groups like puppy class). My concern with a large group like this is just not knowing how others dogs would react to a puppy. I\u2019m not judging or saying OP did anything wrong, just that I\u2019d have weighed that amount of stimuli and potential effects on the pup.", "I\u2019m aware of the distinction. A breeder.

Abandoned puppies are absolutely better to adopt", "Adopting from a shelter doesn\u2019t give you guarantees of behaviour issues. There is more change of some sort of problems being there. Also with medical issues. I know someone who almost gone broke because she was hellbend on \u201csaving the life\u201d of a dog. It only prolonged the suffering. So yes I\u2019m more sceptical with \u201csaving lives\u201d. Also while animals from shelters are not worse then purebreds there are different issues people need to take into account. Looking for a bred you want beside being visually appealing also include reading about the bred and predispositions. Do they like long walks, can I live them alone at home for longer periods of time? Etc. you cannot know it with animals from shelter", "Yeah, the reason is because people will pay ridiculous amounts of money for the label of purebred, not because puppies from breeders are in any way better or healthier", "Yes, and that reason is because people suck, so no need for OP to concern themselves with it", "When in conjunction with a question something like \"what does your husband think\" in a  forum style text post could also be a preemptive defense of the question a.k.a \"I ask because...\" Or could is generally employed when you've asked a question and don't want to wait for a response to make your point.\n\nSeems like assuming it's some kind of passive aggressive metamessage and then attacking an entire community based on the accusation being fact is not a great way to engage is productive discourse", "Agreed. This whole thread indicates someone who didn\u2019t bother to read the story made some shit up. Defending the comment in the first place is asinine. The commenter should have already known what the husband did.", "All the downvotes in the world won't change the facts. \n\nWomen are taken at face value while men are interrogated and called liars no matter what they say or do. \n\nWomen are allowed to be stressed out to the point of losing emotional control while men who raise their voice during an argument are abusive. \n\nWomen can neglect responsibilities at home because they *probably* do all of the \"emotional labor\", while men are deadbeats. \n\nDisplays of emotion show how serious a woman's problem is, while a display of emotion shows how abusive and controlling a man is.", "That's not what I was implying it's only needed if they went home and he was mad at OP for not giving their puppy to his sister and he sides with his mom and sister.  That's the only reason they would need counseling for this scenario", "OP did tell the kid, and she started screaming, remember?", "I know right?! Insane to me.", "Yeah, being a teenager is really fucking hard. You have all these grown up thoughts and ideas, but no one takes you seriously bc you're still a kid.

At one point when I was 17, I took a nap after helping dismantle a bridge at camp. I woke up and the Pathfinders were literally jumping off the bunk beds onto precarious stacks of mattresses. They'd been really great and working hard all day and their brains just shut off.\n\nEarly teenagehood is whack. Your body and brain aren't the same from one day to the next. All your peers are in the same boat so the social dynamic is a mess. Adults are often dialing back their support. You're working so hard to be mature and sometimes you get exhausted and just can't.", "People forget real quick what being 13 year old or a teen in general is like. You see it all the time with delusional parents advocating for no sex ed, anti-lgbtq stuff, etc. because they say that their innocent teenager would never even consider or think of sex until their wedding night. Not *their* child. Not that pure holy angel of a child.\n\nIts extra funny when those same parents had their kid in high school and still think you need to do anything special to make a teenager think about sex.", "MIL knew what we were getting SIL we gave her $200 cash because SIL was wanting cash for her birthday (like many 13 year olds do).", "RIP whatever gift you actually did give her", "Yeah I did see the latter in another thread just now (not before commenting). All good then. To be clear I wasn't saying OP AH for it or anything, just an FYI it was potentially an issue and they might not have known sort of thing.", "Added it to the edit.", "Exactly. So many of these posts are folks who would light themselves on fire to keep others warm, then wondering why it's getting hot. Standing your ground and enforcing your boundaries is NOT making a scene. The person who is making a scene is the one pushing the boundaries.", "I've had many more rescues than purchases.

I know some that wanted a Dalmatian because of Disney. At the same time a girl on my street had a German dog because of scooby soo. So no any other breed was out of question.", "*Reputable* breeders basically sell their pups at cost.
