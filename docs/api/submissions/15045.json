Hell, there's whole movies about it!\n\nVery gentle YTA because you were not asked to intercede in this and you did, causing your sister embarrassment. However, I totally would have done the same thing too, especially if my sister lacked the confidence to do it, though I would have asked her first.\n\nWhat does your father say about all this? This has to be odd for him too.", "The fianc\u00e9\u2019s father is the asshole.  How can he possibly think he should be the one to walk your sister down the aisle?

The only thing you can/should do is talk with your sister and at most your sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Definitely apologize to your sister for how it went down but still let her know that your feelings or opinion on the matter stands. \n\nI also want to add how weird it is that the fianc\u00e9\u2019s father feels like he should even be able to bring this up let alone make a big deal out of it when her father is perfectly willing and capable of walking his own child down the aisle. Is there more background information that you left out or what? This is not normal so future FIL is also an AH.\n\nSister is an AH only bc this shouldn\u2019t even be an issue,if she and her own father have a great relationship. If she\u2019s grown enough to get married then she should be grown enough to tell future FIL that the honor of walking her down the aisle belongs to her father. \n\nI feel like there is some context or background info we are missing.

Why on earth is your sisters future father in law insisting on walking her down the aisle?", "If we're just judging you and the fianc\u00e9's father, ESH.\n\nHe's an obvious asshole for trying to force this - there is only one situation where the groom's father should walk the bride down the aisle, and that's if the bride specifically asks him to. He's completely out of line.\n\nYou're the asshole for getting involved when it wasn't your argument. You're completely right, of course, but unless you had been asked to step in you really shouldn't have. It adds stress for the couple and doesn't handle things they way they want.

The fianc\u00e9e\u2019s father is totally unreasonable in his desire. It\u2019s not his place. It\u2019s not traditional. I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. There have been stories making exceptions when the brides father is not in the picture for whatever reason, but these are exceptions. I believe I would have done the same thing. I\u2019m extremely protective of my family and friend. But alas as you\u2019ve come to find out, it\u2019s not always appreciated. I make no apologies. No one screws with my family or friends and just skates away without being called out. I get that your sister is pissed off but maybe she is not seeing the huge red flag that is waving in her face. She and everyone else needs to learn that it is not always pleasant to learn the truth.", "NTA. It's literally well known tradition that the father walks the bride down.", "NTA.

The only person who should feel entitled to that position is the person the bride asks to do it. Her moment, her call. Period. \n\nYour sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 sucks the second most because it\u2019s his job to manage his family and stand up for his future wife. He should have ended his father\u2019s ridiculous idea the second it came out of his mouth. There\u2019s no reason this should have been entertained long enough that your sister got upset and felt she had to vent about it. He needs to learn to stand up to his parents and prioritize his wife-to-be or their marriage is going to be in some major trouble. \n\nFinally, OP, you kinda suck too (albeit the least of everyone) because this wasn\u2019t your place to get involved. I don\u2019t blame you for getting upset (because I\u2019d be sharpening my pitch fork too in your shoes), but this needs to be something your sister and her fianc\u00e9 figure out. Once they\u2019re married, FFIL is going to be family to them both. They\u2019re going to have to deal with him their whole lives, and they\u2019re going to have to establish their own boundaries.

FFIL is the worst, except maybe fianc\u00e9 is the worst, for not telling his father to knock it off.

No one asked for you to get involved here.  To make things right, you should apologize to your sister and demonstrate that you are not going to interfere in her wedding and marriage in the future.", "YTA. Your sister didn't ask you for help, but you charged in any way. \"I may have gotten a little heated\" seems a pretty clear downplaying of your lack of tact. Sure her future FIL seems like an AH, but you didn't seem to value your sister as an individual either. All you had to do was ask if she wanted you to step in.", "YTA- you definitely should have stayed out of it and let your sister deal with it. While I 100% get where your coming from because sister's FIL is way out of line with this request, it's not your place to say something to him about it. It's up to your sister and her fianc\u00e9 to handle it", "YTA because your sister didn\u2019t ask for your input and you admit you got heated.", "YTA\n\nBefore you tell off a sibling's in-laws you should ensure that your input is desired.", "Yes, YTA.

Now you\u2019ve caused a scene that embarrassed your sister, created more tension/awkwardness with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family, and only increased her stress.\n\nYTA", "ESH, you should have talked to her instead of involving yourself. Why isn't the fianc\u00e9 doing anything about this? If the parents are allowed to do this now without question, she is going to be treated like shit in this marriage. Why isn't she standing up for herself? She really needs to reconsider marrying into this family.", "YTA but he\u2019s an even bigger one and I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t have done the same in your shoes.", "Like, a nice YTA for this specific question.

But had you termed this as \u201cIt is traditional for the father of the bride to walk his daughter down the aisle. Both my father and my sister would be extremely disappointed if they didn\u2019t get to partake in this once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201d \n\nIf he needed more prompting you could have shut him down with a more forceful \u201cIt would be inappropriate for you to walk my sister down the aisle as this is traditionally a role for the father of the bride.\u201d Or even \u201cNo\u201d if he went on. \n\nNow everyone is embarrassed, regardless of your good intent. For which, regrettably, YTA. \n\nHowever, learning how to shut down unreasonable requests without causing upset, arguments or leaving yourself feeling guilty is one of the most liberating skills of maturity. I can\u2019t honestly say you are a total arse for not having learned how to do so. It takes us all some practice. \n\nYou will absolutely find it liberating though, so perhaps OP could give it some practice?", "YTA- for the action of taking to the FIL.   \n\nBut everyone else is a much bigger A. What about her soon to be hubby? He can't stop up to the plate and get dad to back off?  \n\nI think you most likely did something good- just skipped a step. Talk to sister, talk to soon to be BIL, let them handle it.", "YTA. This was not your place to step in. The conflict doesn't involve you and you were not asked to speak up", "YTA.
