More importantly, why is she so threatened by the name of a deceased ex? The audacity", "NTA She needs to stop being so insecure. It's just a boat, and there's literally no threat to her. Your brother needs to strongly consider how much energy he wants to put into such a needy woman", "NTA, she's literally jealous of a dead ex girlfriend. Plus, since it's a unique name, it's even better. Imagine he just named the boat \"Jessica\" or something, this way it's artistic in a way.", "NTA. She's spoken to him and he's told her what he thinks. She's come to you behind his back to get.you to change his mind. Once you've given her your answer, she's continued to pester you. Now she's trying to manipulate you in a different way. You're only involved because she chose to involve you.", "NTA. It\u2019s petty and it seems like your brother might need to reconsider choosing this person\u2026", "Nta. Sounds like D has some jealously issues she needs to handle instead of projecting her insecurities onto the family.", "NTA. Why is she jealous? She\u2019s literally not here anymore. It\u2019s in memory to someone he cares about and that\u2019s sweet and not in need of change.", "NTA - the girlfriend sounds very insecure.   Your brother had a life before her and she is now in his life.  But possibly not for long if she keeps pushing boundaries once it has been set.", "NTA. She can still have a life with him while acknowledging he had a girlfriend that died. She needs to learn how to keep others out of the discussion.", "NTA.\n\nIf they're really building a life together, she needs to communicate with him herself and not try to turn you into her flying monkey. She was trying to manipulate you into doing her bidding.", " Calling her an idiot was mildly assholish but your not responsible for managing her insecurity or jealousy of a deceased loved one. NTA", "NTA. She is competing with a GHOST. She needs to grow up.", "NTA but don't call people idiots. I tell my 10 year old the same thing. You're old enough to know better.", "NTA.  Does D claim to be adult?  If so, why the schoolgirl behavior?   IMO it might be helpful if you learn how to say no without saying no.   Arguments lead to arguments, never to solutions.", "NTA. But you could have said the same thing without calling her names.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

D has some insecurity/jealousy issues.", "NTA\n\nAll the jealousy she has for a deceased person aside, I'm pretty sure it is considered really unlucky to change the name of a boat?\n\nI don't believe in things like that but I think a lot of boat people do and if your brother does then its even more selfish of her to try and drag you into pressuring him.", "Nta. I misread what you wrote and thought it was a goat! Sounded kinda weird to name a goat after your deceased girlfriend but each to their own ya know?\n\nShe's being insecure about a dead person, that's ridiculous. I would encourage him to keep the name. It's a really nice gesture .", "NTA.  If they are engaged I would think that means your brother loves her.  If she's that concerned about it, she should express her feelings to your brother.  If she can't talk to him about this, the rest of the marriage should be interesting.  Communication is a huge part of a relationship.", "NTA most people won\u2019t assume the boat is named after a person. I\u2019m guessing the boat is Mona Lisa and not Girl With A Pearl Earring, because that would be an incredibly odd and unique name. Expecting your brother to change the name of the boat is presumptuous and disrespectful. Not just towards his former partner, but to him. She sounds like the type who\u2019d expect you to change a pet\u2019s name too.", "NTA. She tried to manipulate the situation in her favor and it backfired.", "NTA. She's way too immature for her age.", "NTA, there's no reason for you to even be involved here. This should a conversation for the future couple. How you feel about the boat name is irrelevant, really. If future wife has an issue with the boat name, future husband should be the one she talks to. If I were you, if a similar thing happens later, I would just decline to get involved. It's none of your business, really.", "NTA \n\nAnd because I can\u2019t help myself is it the Fraulein Madonna with the big \ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49 (desperately hope there\u2019s people here who get this)", "NTA.\n\nOlympia?", "OP, I\u2019m dying to know the name. If it\u2019s something as unique as SS Mona Lisa or SS Olympia, this is a solid NTA", "YTA. You're not wrong, but you could have told her the same thing without resorting to name calling.", "YTA - you used the I word and that's a big no no. I believe it's highly offensive slur and shouldn't be used.", "This is exactly my point, it's a boat, whoop dee da. It's not like he has her name tattooed on his forehead", "I feel like if it was called Jessica people would ask more questions since that's actually a lot of peoples names, right now it's just a painting to most people", "Yeah if I was OP I'd talk to the brother about this but for his sake not hers.\n\nHe clearly doesn't want to change it and has every right to keep the name but I feel like it's just going to build up to a bigger issue later on, If she can't get over it now then it's not just going to go away.\n\nNTA", "do you spend all day giving your opinions on aita? lol thats really cool dood.", "It\u2019s okay to call a duck a duck", "Lmao exactly. D sounds exhausting.", "being insecure of a dead person doesnt sound particularly mature\n\nNTA", "My point as well! Maybe it didn't sound like that in my comment. \\^", "Plus the ick of trying to bully his sister into helping her 'win' against him rather than respecting his decisions, that's a bit of an alarm bell for future arguments where he may wind up with all and sundry being dragged into it either against him or complaining to him about her attempts to use them to undermine him. NTA and tell him, deffo.", "If she keeps it up, her *place in the family* will be out of it.", "Yeah, she doesn't have an issue with going behind his back and getting other people involved."]}
