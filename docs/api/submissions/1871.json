Your brother needs to strongly consider how much energy he wants to put into such a needy woman", "NTA, she's literally jealous of a dead ex girlfriend. Plus, since it's a unique name, it's even better. Imagine he just named the boat \"Jessica\" or something, this way it's artistic in a way.", "NTA. She's spoken to him and he's told her what he thinks. She's come to you behind his back to get.you to change his mind. Once you've given her your answer, she's continued to pester you.

Your brother had a life before her and she is now in his life.  But possibly not for long if she keeps pushing boundaries once it has been set.", "NTA. She can still have a life with him while acknowledging he had a girlfriend that died. She needs to learn how to keep others out of the discussion.", "NTA.\n\nIf they're really building a life together, she needs to communicate with him herself and not try to turn you into her flying monkey.

D has some insecurity/jealousy issues.", "NTA\n\nAll the jealousy she has for a deceased person aside, I'm pretty sure it is considered really unlucky to change the name of a boat?\n\nI don't believe in things like that but I think a lot of boat people do and if your brother does then its even more selfish of her to try and drag you into pressuring him.", "Nta. I misread what you wrote and thought it was a goat! Sounded kinda weird to name a goat after your deceased girlfriend but each to their own ya know?\n\nShe's being insecure about a dead person, that's ridiculous. I would encourage him to keep the name. It's a really nice gesture .", "NTA.  If they are engaged I would think that means your brother loves her.  If she's that concerned about it, she should express her feelings to your brother.  If she can't talk to him about this, the rest of the marriage should be interesting.  Communication is a huge part of a relationship.", "NTA most people won\u2019t assume the boat is named after a person. I\u2019m guessing the boat is Mona Lisa and not Girl With A Pearl Earring, because that would be an incredibly odd and unique name. Expecting your brother to change the name of the boat is presumptuous and disrespectful. Not just towards his former partner, but to him. She sounds like the type who\u2019d expect you to change a pet\u2019s name too.", "NTA. She tried to manipulate the situation in her favor and it backfired.", "NTA. She's way too immature for her age.", "NTA, there's no reason for you to even be involved here. This should a conversation for the future couple. How you feel about the boat name is irrelevant, really. If future wife has an issue with the boat name, future husband should be the one she talks to. If I were you, if a similar thing happens later, I would just decline to get involved.

I believe it's highly offensive slur and shouldn't be used.", "This is exactly my point, it's a boat, whoop dee da. It's not like he has her name tattooed on his forehead", "I feel like if it was called Jessica people would ask more questions since that's actually a lot of peoples names, right now it's just a painting to most people", "Yeah if I was OP I'd talk to the brother about this but for his sake not hers.\n\nHe clearly doesn't want to change it and has every right to keep the name but I feel like it's just going to build up to a bigger issue later on, If she can't get over it now then it's not just going to go away.\n\nNTA", "do you spend all day giving your opinions on aita? lol thats really cool dood.", "It\u2019s okay to call a duck a duck", "Lmao exactly.

Maybe it didn't sound like that in my comment. \\^", "Plus the ick of trying to bully his sister into helping her 'win' against him rather than respecting his decisions, that's a bit of an alarm bell for future arguments where he may wind up with all and sundry being dragged into it either against him or complaining to him about her attempts to use them to undermine him.

You are 28 not 14.", "NTA. I don't think you needed to call D an idiot, but if she's going get so bent out of shape over and name and relying on you to play middleman and fix her relationship issues, she doesn't sound like she's ready for marriage.", "NTA and definitely tell your brother about it", "The boat's name is Mona, isn't it?", "NTA- tell your brother.
