It saved us both money at the time. It's a bit over 3 acres but our houses are built right beside each other. For the mortgage we do a 60/30 payment because we have more people (\"Trent\" is single with no kids). We usually did dinners together, outings together and everything in between, as we are all very close to Trent. But issues started forming 4 months ago when Trent's father was diagnosed with cancer and wasn't doing well. He asked if we cared if he had his father move on the property and despite having my issues with it, we allowed it because his father was sick and morally we couldn't say no, but now I wish we had.\n\nBasically, his father is a Vietnam vet and has PTSD on top of cancer. If the kids get loud I've noticed that this guy starts getting really weird and starts coping an attitude with Trent (never us). If the kids go outdoors to play, all the sudden Trent's dad will find some yard work to do (even if he did it just 3 days ago) and minimize where the kids can be. Dinners have became frustrating because Trent still wants to have dinner with us (he doesn't get along with his dad) but Trent's dad pitches a fit and wants to be included: which means we have whatever the fuck this guy wants for dinner every single night (which is super repetitive, as all he wants is chicken fingers, potatoes, hot dogs or hamburgers). If we use the grill, he comes out and starts dictating how we use it. If the kids use their skateboards he will watch and scowl. If the kids get too close to his vehicle he starts throwing a piss fit. If we do laundry (shared laundry system) he freaks out because we are \"loading it too full\" and tries telling us how to use a washer/dryer. He also keeps recruiting my oldest son to do irrelevant tasks (like painting a concrete basement that no one uses IN TRENTS house). \n\nIt all came to a head yesterday because Trents dad came knocking on my door telling me that I needed to call my husband out of work because he needed help renovating Trents house (not even sure Trent knows about this) and then yelled at my daughter to get her bike out of the driveway, got in his vehicle and started it.. as soon as she moved the bike he got out of his car and went inside so he wasn't even going anywhere. He was just being a cunt. I told my husband we were talking to Trent immediately about his dad leaving. He doesn't pay to be here and I'm tired of living under a dictatorship. Trent later stated \"well it's because he was a marine and runs things differently' but I stood my ground and said he's got to go. Everyone agrees but they feel bad because of this guy's cancer.\n\nETA: I meant to say 60/40. Sorry for the error. Technically both houses are \"ours\". The two houses are connected through a long hallway because it was cheaper to get one building permit, rather than 2.
