Back at the end of June one of my very good friends (also 24m) was still living at home and was looking to move somewhere else just to get some space and have a bit more independance. So for the past almost 6 months I've been renting a room in my house for around $100 off market value.\n\nSince then things have mostly been good. Really the only issues being that I like to keep my house neat and tidy and have a higher level of cleanliness than he does, which means I do the majority of the cleaning but have him clean the bathroom once a week and deal with recyclables and cleaning my front mud room. To be fair though I am a bit of a neat freak haha.\n\nOn to the main topic though. About 3 months ago my roommate got into a relationship. I knew her beforehand so we arent strangers. The problem is she is over a lot in my opinion. Pretty much without fail since they got together she spends the night every weekend (Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night) and also spends the night one or two weekdays. So she is over at minimum 3 days a week to 5 days a week. The girlfriend lives at home with her parents still so that's why she's over a lot.\n\nIt's not even the fact she's over that's a big deal to me, if they just stayed in his room id pretty chill with it, but they always take over the livingroom when she's here. They often cook food and don't clean up the kitchen (kitchen counters will be filthy and he will do a half assed Job wiping it down). I work night shifts and a handful of times now I've been woken up to them being quite loud (her in particular). \n\nWIBTA if a approached my roommate to ask him to have her over less or either having her contribute rent as well. Roommate is a good friend of mine and approaching this topic is very tricky since I don't want to cause a ripple. At the same time though I don't think it's fair I have to walk on eggshells in my own house and clean up more because she's over all the time.", "created_utc": 1702806049, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kdujn/wibta_for_either_asking_my_roommate_to_have_his/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I need to be able to enjoy those spaces too. Could you limit her being over to Friday and Saturday?\u201d", "YWNBTA and he's not being a very good friend, is he?  Your friend knows you're uncomfortable in messy spaces and yet he invites someone over on the regular and makes double the usual mess and doesn't clean it up.  They're taking over the living room most of the week so you can't enjoy that space.  They know they're making a lot of noise and they keep doing that.  Your friend and his girlfriend are constantly making choices to make you uncomfortable in your own home, and they're making them clean up after you.  I don't think your friend is making much progress toward independence, more like treating you like his parents, who likely weren't so sad to see him take his mess and laziness to somebody else's house.  Did he sign a lease and if not, maybe it's time for that with rules for overnight guests being there only two nights a week.  Please don't have her contribute rent, because that's likely to turn into her feeling invited to move in, and then you'll never be rid of them.  Please do tell him that this is not a sustainable situation, and see how he responds.  If he doesn't apologize and straighten this out in a week, then it's likely only going to get worse, because the guy is a mooch who doesn't care how you're feeling.", "I don\u2019t think you would be the ah. Because your just being honest but i feel like you shouldn\u2019t approach with intent to get rent you should tell her that she needs to clean up after her self and be more respectful, and tell her if she js going to act like she lives there then she\u2019s gotta look after it like it\u2019s hers and out of respect yk. As long as you approach it the right way she cant be calling you a ah.", "NTA. But If the issue isn't so much about her being there, but them taking up the livingroom so much, I would perhaps let him know that some evenings in the week and weekends you'd rather they stay in his room as it's your down time too and sometimes you want to chill without guests around. \n\nBut honestly if you did just want to ask that she be over less then say that. \n\nI wouldn't go into the whole hee paying rent thing, because that's essentially you accepting another lodger and it will likely result in her thinking that it's ok to move in, and I don't actually think that's what you want. \n\nAlso talk to him about leaving the kitchen in a mess. This is your house, he needs the respect that and sounds like he's getting a pretty good deal.", "I don\u2019t think u would be the AH. Its your house too and you just want it to be clean. If not reducing her frequency of visits, they can at least clean up their mess and if you mention ur uncomfortableness, they might even try to be quieter. They are your frnds after-all!", "Yup, I\u2019d absolutely talk to them asap. And yes, I\u2019d personally sit down with the both of them, since this concerns her, too and, that way you avoid your point being misinterpreted. It\u2019s your house, she\u2019s not your flatmate, which means she should be essentially invisible as far as your comfort goes (whether it\u2019s sitting on your own couch, or watching your own TV, and especially having to clean up after her). Also, if she stays there more nights than she doesn\u2019t, that means you\u2019ve gotten yourself a squatter, which is why you feel like you\u2019re walking on eggshells. The longer you go without saying anything, the more your friend/flatmate will think you\u2019re okay with this situation, and the harder it will get to bring it up. She probably knows this and it\u2019s the reason she hasn\u2019t once asked if you\u2019re ok with her hanging out there. Watch out.\n\nETA: WNBTA", "you wouldn't be an asshole for having the conversation. your house, your rules.\n\nit sounds like you want money from her out of frustration with the situation. Maybe try approaching them about cleaning up better and being more respectful of your space and see how that goes before digging into rent", "I don\u2019t think asking to cover rent is going to be fair since it\u2019s hard to divide that up if she\u2019s not over 100% of the time living there but I think it\u2019s a shared space and you should both have a say into the guests you have over and they need to respect your wishes and have the gf over less", "I think you need to figure out exactly what it is that you want to communicate to your room mate.\n\nIs it that you want them to spend less time in the living room and leave the kitchen clean or is it that you want her to pay rent?\n\nIf she starts contributing to rent, then she will actually be more entitled to the living room/kitchen area. So you wouldn't be able to ask them to be in their room more. \n\nBasically figure out which one you would value more the money or the space? And then discuss with your room mate accordingly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The money is a bit much, maybe, but the cleaning and the noise? No stamp down on that. Tell him, his mess, he cleans it up or he's out. He's 24, not 14, he can do better. Tell him, you wake me up after nights and I'll wake you up when you're asleep.... I did this for one of my wife's friends who drunk called people at 2am. I threatened to ring her doorbell at 3am, while I was on a night shift, repeatedly, if she ever rang us again...", "Honestly NTA.\n\nBut I think you might want to suggest that they move out instead. Because the problem is so much more than just her being around a lot.\n\nYou are a neat freak, and basically he is paying $100 off room rental but basically having the entire house (except your room) and having a free housekeeper as well. To me that\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nOn top of that he/they are now disrupting your life and making you feel like you are walking on eggshells..", "NTA, but before asking for a rent contribution I would insist that they pick up and clean after themselves. Also they can't be allowed to take over the living room. They are making themselves feel too much at home! I think having them move out might be on the cards. You have rented your friend a home, and he has basically taken over the house. That is not acceptable! Put on your landlord hat.", "YWNBTA, you need to nip this in the bud. I had a roommate railroad me into living with her obnoxious boyfriend once and it started out just like this. He lived with his parents, it was easier to hang out at our place so he was over for days at a time, and when I told her he needed to be over less she\u2019d mope around without him, whining and making me feel guilty. She decided that if he paid rent then I couldn\u2019t be mad, and he could be there as much as she wanted. They were delighted to move him in, immediately got even more obnoxious, it was miserable for a year until they finally moved out, and we all hated each other by then. \n\nDon\u2019t ask her for rent, it\u2019s a slippery slope. Put the onus on him. His guest is causing you to be uncomfortable in your own home, give him boundaries and make sure he sticks to them. And make sure he knows that she\u2019s regarded as his guest, not an additional roommate.", "If he's that good a friend he should be able to take you saying this. If he can't then he isn'y great a friend and perhaps you need to ask him to move out.\n\nBe careful what you decide to ask him, because if he starts paying you more rent, then she can be there as much as he wants. To be honest, with you working nights this situation isn't ideal for you and will be an ongoing problem if you don't talk to him.", "Nta", "For future, that's why drafting a \"rental agreement\" can be useful. So for difficult conversations like this, you can refer back to it. \"In the rental agreement I gave you, it says guests are only allowed to sleep over 3 times a week, and not more than 2 consecutive nights. No loud noise past 10 pm on weeknights and 11 on weekends, and kitchen and shared areas must be left in tidy condition and shared.\"\n\nYou've broken several of these terms over the past month. \n\nBut for now, I would message him to arrange a \"housemate meeting\" between you two. Prepare some points so you know what to say and just kindly say it. \"Your girlfriend is too loud at nights and wakes me up frequently. You both also don't leave the kitchen in an appropriate state after cooking. And the living room is a shared space. Having your girlfriend over 5 days a week is too much, and if that continues I will have to ask that she contribute to the increase in bills.\" NTA", "That's a good point.\n\nI work shift work, so it works out every third weekend I have Friday through Monday off. I might ask him that when I have my third weekends off that she doesn't come over. That means that still three weekends a month she could still come over.", "Yeah, she\u2019s already taking liberties, if she starts paying to be there it\u2019s only going to get worse for OP. Giving them boundaries is the best way to address the situation.", "That's a very good point. I hadn't thought about it that way, if she did contribute to rent it would condone that behaviour.\n\nThank you very much for your insight :)", "I like that idea.  And no weeknights.  And they clean up after themselves.  They're treating you like a maid or the owner of a bawdy house with all the noise."]}
