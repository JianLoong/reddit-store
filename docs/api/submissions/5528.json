I can't stand people like your other friend. Stop trying to get offended on other people's behalf, especially when no one of that ethnic/religious group would get offended by it", "And since when is a blue shirt Jewish? We\u2019re lighting 7th night candles and zooming relatives. I\u2019m not wearing blue - this is new to me.", "NTA! She\u2019s being a bully", "NTA. You\u2019re not cosplaying a religion, you\u2019re helping a loved one to experience their culture. It\u2019s not appropriation when you\u2019re following the same normities and a person of that religion approved of it", "An odd paradox is the antisemitism in the \u201cwoke\u201d movement.  Honestly this would piss me off enough I would flip this on her big time.  \n\nI would post publicly that you are helping a close friend who couldn\u2019t be home for the holidays.  You didn\u2019t grow up with his customs but are doing your best.  The outcome of your efforts made him feel supported and respected.  \n\nI\u2019d state you don\u2019t appreciated her antisemitism, and if she has any Jewish acquaintances needing support \u2026 please send them your way where they will be honored as human beings and not virtue signals.", "NTA. Her ignorance is astounding. Just ignore garbage people like her", "NTA. I think you need to ask her whom you think you have harmed. If your friend Will was fine with it, and he posted the photos, then who is she to determine otherwise?  She needs to learn the difference between appreciation and support from appropriation.", "NTA. I'm 1000% sure of Nadine is not Jewish. Or is close friends  with anyone Jewish. She also does not have good intentions at all. I'd honestly just cut her out of my life.\n\nCalling her the woke police is a bit um though. People woke in the original sense would not like her.", "NTA- you did a wonderful good deed! The orthodox jewish woman i follow on tiktok shares her recipes and what she is serving for the holidays. She wouldn't share if she had a problem with non jewish people making jewish foods. Plenty of non kosher places make things like brisket and matzaball soup! Your \"friend\" is behaving like a shit stirrer. Can you block her from seeing your social media posts?", "As a Jewish person, I can honestly say I've never heard of someone \"going home for Hanukkah\".", "NTA\n\nIn the name of \"good intentions\" so very much harm has been done to so very many people. Ignore her - she's only showing her own poor qualities.", "NTA. The world would be a better place if everyone just minded their own fucking business.", "Not to mention, her actions are defamation. You could potentially have an actionable case.  Especially if her posting has resulted in harassment and other reputation-affecting published comments.", "There goes half my wardrobe", "I guess at your age you can\u2019t understand sarcasm yet.", "Just spray paint them a different color", "Maybe your too senile to pull it off. Go be butt hurt your bad joke didn't land elsewhere.", "NTA I am so sick of woke people and their bullshit. You were doing an act of kindness for a friend who couldn't  celebrate their own holiday. You weren't trying to \"take it\" or mock it. You did something with respect and good intentions. You might want to rethink your friendship with thus woman who seems intent on waking up the world. As far as I am aware no one likes being slapped  awake", "NTA", "NTA. Block her everywhere. Distance yourself from people who support her. This girl is so desperate for attention she\u2019ll slander any and everyone to make herself look good.\n\nYou did a sweet thing for your roommate. I\u2019d love someone to make me latkes.", "NTA.", "Hi! Jewish person here!\n\nNTA at all!\n\nIf I'd been in Will's position, and a friend had done for me what you did for him, I'd have been just as touched and grateful. And honestly, I'd probably have been so caught up on the candles and food that I wouldn't even have noticed the shirt unless it was pointed out to me.\n\nNadine can go pound sand. And if Nadine isn't Jewish, she can go pound sand twice as hard. Jews have a looooooong history of other groups trying to dictate what is and isn't antisemitic, and we don't need shit like thus.\n\nEnjoy the rest of Hanukkah/Christmas/whatever you like to celebrate!", "Nadine sounds exhausting. NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s ridiculous. Block her on everything.", "NTA take his word for it that you weren't. Theres nothing wrong with calling people out when it needs to happen but you were helping a friend who appreciated it. She can fuck off.", "LOL, as a Jewish woman I can confidently say we do not own the freakin' color blue.\n\nNTA and this person sounds absolutely insufferable. why are you friends with her? you did a mitzvah for a friend; ignore this schmuck.", "NTA at all. I wonder how many people visit Nadine's page for her latest cultural appropriation diatribes and laugh about it. Nadine is the gift that keeps on giving.", "NTA.  There is a huge difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation.  You did nothing wrong and your ex-friend is a self-righteousness jerk.", "NTA \n\nCultural appropriation vs appreciation. This is appreciation something you did for your friend", "tis a dark day for best buy", "Definitely cultural appreciation not appropriation.", "This.  Please, please do this.  Word for word.", "Lol no, grow a pair like wtf. You know all culture is human culture right? Also borders and countries are man-made and don't actually \"exist\" yall just like labeling and segregating ppl, grow up.", "NTA the only way I could see her point was if you were wearing tallit/tzitzit which is a white and blue prayer shawl/scarf (in more liberal synagogues its more like a scarf). As long as you aren't leading the prayers or wearing actual religious clothing I think you should be fine. \n\nThat saying I'm not Jewish. My cousin converted and I have been thinking about converting and reading a lot of Jewish literature.", "NTA Robert and Nadine sound fucking exhausting, tell them they're banned from all festivities and wearing red for the entire month of December if they're not church going Christians", "You were not rude. I think calling this woman your \u201cfriend\u201d is a stretch. I would seriously go NC with her. You are NTA. The good news is that she is making a fool of herself in front of the entire world, so\u2026", "NTA block her she can go police other people", "Bro she wanted attention and clout. If she really cared she\u2019d be out in the real world standing up for the real injustices not a blue fucking shirt. Send her some of the left over Jewish delicacies and ask her to chill the fuck out there\u2019s real shit going on in the world. Classic woke yt girl move. It\u2019s Jarring.", "Jewish folks don\u2019t OWN that color. You\u2019re allowed to wear it. And your intent was to be festive and supportive towards your friend.\n\nBesides, if a Jewish friend wore red and green and came to my Christmas Party, I\u2019d never think they were appropriating anything, I\u2019d think they were participating.\n\nNTA", ">and she had good intentions\n\nNo, she had self-righteous intentions", "NTA. Also, to all those people who say that the friends intentions seem good. Her intentions are to help herself to unearned feelings of moral superiority. How are those intentions good?", "NTA.\nIf the person who is the minority in a scenario says it's not a problem and the ally ignores/keeps pushing anyway they are being a bad ally. \n\nThe book The White Allies Handbook (written by a black woman incase you bring it up to her and she tries to brush it off) talks about how one of the most important things a good ally can do is listen to what person is saying/wants instead of using them as a prop for their own self righteousness.", "take action. make your own activism page. \n\nTalk to actual Jewish people who will all tell you that celebrating Hanukkah with your Jewish friend in a blue shirt is not appropriation, is not a problem, and is, in fact, welcomed and a nice gesture. \n\ncall out fake activism where people are extremely ignorant, uninformed, don't know what they're talking about, and call out things they know nothing about, that are not seen as problematic by the actual people it concerns, in this case Jewish people. \n\nHighlight how this type of activism helps nobody and only harms people, and that ignorant people who don't bother informing themselves about what they're talking about, would do more good by just being quiet. \n\nAdvocate for actually listening to the people who are part of the minorities that it concerns instead of some random white lady with complexes, and advocate for actually learning about different cultures and what matters to them before opening your mouth online.", "Jew here.  You ARE NOT T A.  You are a lovely lovely friend who tried to do something lovely for a lonely friend.  She is a misinformed overly woke individual who needs to grow up.  This was not cultural misappropriation.   Keep it up OP x", "I hate to go full AsAJew, but this is actually a super nice thing that you did. You're awesome. Thank you for helping someone when he was feeling down. It actually really means a lot that you went out of your way to include Will and his traditions.\n\nNTA but your friend going off about the colour blue (?? I mean, really? It's not like you're a creepy Christian trying to co-opt our holidays for yourself; you're literally trying to lift someone's spirits with food) is definitely TA.", "If the actual Jewish person doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong, I don\u2019t see why the non-Jewish person should take offence.
