We've known eachother since birth because my dad and his mom are close friends.\n\nWill is Jewish and he hasn't been able to get home for Hanukkah which has made him a depressed. He initially wanted to do nothing to celebrate and just sulk but I bought a menorah and we've been lighting the candles every night. He isn't religious but it's been fun learning about his traditions.\n\nYesterday, I didn't not have work so I decided to try make some traditional Jewish food for him since he baked me a cake for my birthday a few months ago. I love cooking but I'm a hazard in the kitchen so I had to start early but I managed to make some brisket, latkes and some (misshapen) challah bread. I burned myself atleast six times but I love learning new recipes so it's all good. I also had a blue shirt that looks similar to the blue that a lot of Hanukkah decorations are so I put that on.\n\nWhen Will got home, he posted the food on his snap story and I appeared in some of the shots. One of our mutual friends, Nadine (21F) then messaged me and 'called me out' for 'cosplaying' Jewish culture. I can only describe her as the woke police and most of us have learnt to ignore her white guilt and saviourism but this pissed me off so I decided to engage. I told her that I was trying to do something nice for a friend (will) who was sad he couldn't celebrate with family and he appreciated my efforts. She told me that the food wasn't a big deal, but me wearing the blue shirt was 'blatant appropriation' and I shouldn't have done it. This was obviously completely ridiculous and I told her to mind her own business and leave me the hell alone.\n\nShe's now shared the conversation with other friends and even posted it to her Instagram activism account, staying that her 'business' is to call out people like me who are being harmful. She's demanding that I apologize and acknowledge my 'ignorance' in order for her to take them down. Other friends agree that she is being ridiculous, but that I was wrong to be rude to her because we know how she is and she had good intentions. Another friend, Robert (20M) even said that I was being an asshole for getting rude to her and refusing to apologize. Will doesn't think I'm wrong and this whole situation has me really confused.

When she says she's not, then ask her how its hurting her, or bothering her in any way, and youre sure if someone from the Jewish community had a problem with it, they can bring it to you.

This isn\u2019t it. You were trying to do good by helping a friend feel better while also learning about his culture. Ignore her.", "NTA. It seems like Nadine was trying to call you out for something that was not actually a problem, and that you were simply trying to be a good friend to Will by cooking for him and showing an interest in his traditions. While it is important to be mindful of cultural sensitivity and appropriateness, it does not seem like you were trying to appropriate or disrespect Jewish culture in any way. You have the right to defend yourself and set boundaries with people who are being unreasonable or trying to police your actions in a way that is not warranted.

I am public health student, and something we talk about a lot is white saviorism, and how white people just barge into situations, claim they know what is right and wrong, without even asking people of the specific community that they are trying to help. People can cause a lot of harm to communities that way.

As a 100% Jewish person, I appreciate the effort you went to for your friend! It's soooo nice to see people interested in learning about the traditions. I'm not very religious but growing up and having zero Jewish friends to share the holidays with was really sad. I would have loved if a friend did this for me.  My husband isn't Jewish at all and during the holiday season he makes sure to go all out buying menorahs, lighting candles, decorating the house with blue and white hanukkah decorations, and it makes me feel so nice. There is literally no reason why she should think that wearing blue is cultural appropriation. I don't think she even knows what that actually means, she's just trying to appear woke to get attention. Keep doing what you're doing and know that all of us actual Jews think it's awesome!", "\"You're speaking over the people you claim to protect, as well.\"\n\nThis is exactly right. What you are doing is the diametric opposite of appropriation. You are learning about a culture from a primary source. That is s-tier culturally sensitive learning.

But if you say \"you're a narcissist asshole and nobody likes you\", the conflict will escalate and she'll dig into her position even deeper.", "I don't believe in assigning medical diagnoses to people. I'm not qualified and it only furthers the stigmatization and hatred of disabled people.\n\nBesides that, when you want to make a genuine effort to help someone, it's bad form to insult them. They will get defensive and refuse to listen to you.", "Not sure where you\u2019re from (I\u2019m assuming USA) but that can have legal consequences\u2026"]}
