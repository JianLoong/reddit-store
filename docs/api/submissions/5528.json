We've known eachother since birth because my dad and his mom are close friends.\n\nWill is Jewish and he hasn't been able to get home for Hanukkah which has made him a depressed. He initially wanted to do nothing to celebrate and just sulk but I bought a menorah and we've been lighting the candles every night. He isn't religious but it's been fun learning about his traditions.\n\nYesterday, I didn't not have work so I decided to try make some traditional Jewish food for him since he baked me a cake for my birthday a few months ago. I love cooking but I'm a hazard in the kitchen so I had to start early but I managed to make some brisket, latkes and some (misshapen) challah bread. I burned myself atleast six times but I love learning new recipes so it's all good. I also had a blue shirt that looks similar to the blue that a lot of Hanukkah decorations are so I put that on.\n\nWhen Will got home, he posted the food on his snap story and I appeared in some of the shots. One of our mutual friends, Nadine (21F) then messaged me and 'called me out' for 'cosplaying' Jewish culture. I can only describe her as the woke police and most of us have learnt to ignore her white guilt and saviourism but this pissed me off so I decided to engage. I told her that I was trying to do something nice for a friend (will) who was sad he couldn't celebrate with family and he appreciated my efforts. She told me that the food wasn't a big deal, but me wearing the blue shirt was 'blatant appropriation' and I shouldn't have done it. This was obviously completely ridiculous and I told her to mind her own business and leave me the hell alone.\n\nShe's now shared the conversation with other friends and even posted it to her Instagram activism account, staying that her 'business' is to call out people like me who are being harmful. She's demanding that I apologize and acknowledge my 'ignorance' in order for her to take them down. Other friends agree that she is being ridiculous, but that I was wrong to be rude to her because we know how she is and she had good intentions. Another friend, Robert (20M) even said that I was being an asshole for getting rude to her and refusing to apologize. Will doesn't think I'm wrong and this whole situation has me really confused.

My husband isn't Jewish at all and during the holiday season he makes sure to go all out buying menorahs, lighting candles, decorating the house with blue and white hanukkah decorations, and it makes me feel so nice.

What you are doing is the diametric opposite of appropriation. You are learning about a culture from a primary source. That is s-tier culturally sensitive learning.
