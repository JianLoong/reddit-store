Firstly you guilted Kyle into coming when he cannot afford it, then you bail on him and decide he can do it himself. And you call yourself a friend?", "Holy fuck YWBTA.\n\n>My friends have said Kyle is a big boy and doesn\u2019t need his hand held the entire time\n\nWhat are you even talking about??? He was very responsibly going to NOT go because he couldn't afford it. Then you and your friend harrassed him until he caved, and then made plans with him to get there in a way you could all afford. You're doing all this over only 9 HOURS??? Like, you're a big boy now. You can't do a nine-hour drive?", "YTA\n\n\"he\u2019s had more than enough time to figure out transportation\" - yeah, he figured out that he was driving with you and your other friend! Now you want this guy who doesn't have money to buy a plane ticket?\n\nHow about you step up as friends and use your corporate finance money and offer to split his ticket with him 3 ways?", "YTA\n\nSo he wasn't going to go because he couldn't afford it and you guilted him into going anyway. You basically set up a solution so he could go after you again, Guilted him, into going and now you're going to bail? Also, your friends sound horrible and I hope you never have to call them in a moment of need, but I'd be willing to bet Kyle would drop everything to help you if he could.\n\nYou and Ryan need to either figure out a way to help him make it there, be it one of you eats the cost of the flight, after all, you make so much more than Kyle, or you need to stick to the original plan and drive.\n\nI'd say you're already TA for entertaining the idea, but if you aren't going to help Kyle get there, then I've got news for you, you don't care about Kyle and he's not really your friend, and if this is the case, then you need to do some serious reevaluation of your morals because, at this point, you sound like a complete tool.", "YWBTA.  Did you tell you friends he WAS being a big boy & opting not to go? Until you swooped in and convinced him to go by saying you could all drive together? Seems like he did indeed have his transportation figured out. YOU are the one changing it. Only thing that would make you not an AH now is for you & Rob to split the cost & gift Kyle a plane ticket to go with you guys.", "YTA for bailing when you  know Kyle can't afford to fly.

He can't afford it--end of story. That doesn't make him a \"total douche\" if he didn't go.  If there's a douche award to be given, it's to the couple who planned this \"extremely expensive\" destination wedding.  \n\nYou and Rob getting Kyle's hopes up, letting him take time off work, etc. only to bail on him is only the icing on the AH cake.", "YTA. He made a decision not to go to the wedding based on his financial possibilities. You and your other AH friend guilted him into going (yet didn't offer to help him with the costs in any way - not that you should, but you just guilted him without offering any kind of real assistance) and now you intend to remove the only bit of support you were going to provide for him by bailing on him about the road trip. \n\nYou and your friend are huge AHs. And I hope Kyle tells you as much. Next time, accept people's decisions and mind your own business.", "\" I feel really bad cuz I want Kyle there\"  No you don't.  You're trying to be a BSD (big swinging dick) on Wall Street or the City, and act like you've got all this cash and bravado.

You knew it would be from the beginning - please spare me the idea that you work in finance and didn't do the maths here.\n\nYou really are perfect for corporate finance, you narcissist.   I can see you justifying burning Brazilian rain forests down for pastures or mining gold and ruining rivers for native populations because \"you didn't realize it would be inconvenient\".\n\nYou and Rod or you alone can use some money from your well paying jobs you bragged about to live up to your word.   Or are you a poor, just like Kyle?   YTA and you will, amazingly, be an even bigger one by not fulling your promise of somehow getting Kyle there, whether by car or paying for his ticket.  His ticket won't even cost one day of work for you, right?   This is what happens when you talk like a big boy.  Open up that wallet and charge it on your card.\n\nI have friends in corporate finance that would find your cheapness hysterical.  First time with a job paying over 50K a year?  LOL.  Suck it up - you acted like a bsd, now you pay like one.", "YTA \n\n\nYou \"guilted\" him.

I didn't realize my behavior was douche-y. I'll go get a job with double the salary.\" \n\n\nDoesn't work like that. \n\n\n\nYou wouldn't be an AH for not driving, but you spent a bunch of time beating him down and making him feel bad about not being able to go.....like he doesn't already feel bad enough about not having a high paying job and being able to afford things important to him.\n\n\n\nYou could have either A) Been supportive--\"It sucks you can't make it, but I know Groom will understand.\"   Or B) you and Rod offer to split Kyle's plane ticket (which he wouldn't be an AH for not accepting either).", "He wasn\u2019t going to go.

Now you're bailing on him, and you claim that he should have figured out transportation even though from his POV, transportation *is* figured out? Because *you* promised him you'd drive there with him? \n\nAll this because 9 hours is too long a drive?\n\nYTA. You're also a terrible friend.", "YTA you acknowledge that Kyle is an important enough friend that he should attend and offered to help him get there by driving. I do think it would be a bit asshole-ish to back out. Frankly me + 2 friends doing a 9 hour drive sounds fun and easy. Cancelling now 2 months before the event is kind of shitty. Perhaps you and Rod would consider offering to contribute cash towards Kyle's plane ticket so he doesn't have to cancel his RSVP or scramble to figure out transportation on his own? It might well be worth chipping in say $75-$100 each to ensure your whole group gets to enjoy the event", ">We guilted him into making something work because it\u2019s one of our great friends and Kyle would be a total douche if he didn\u2019t go.\n\n**YTA** for guilting him into going in the first place.

He was counting on you guys to be there for him. He probably has already requested days of work, bought a suit, did maintenance on his car, bought a gift, etc.... Please don't do this to him. Tough it out and ride with your friend.", "YTA for guilting him into going in the first place.", "INFO\n\nAre you deliberately trying to make Kyle look bad to your mutual friends? i'm asking this sincerely, because I can't see any other reason for pressuring your friend into making a commitment that you knew he'd be unable to keep without you, and then letting him down last minute. If you'd just let him turn down the invite like he wanted, all would be fine. As it is, he's not only not going to the wedding but he'll look bad for not showing up. Why would you do this to someone? You seem to really, really resent Kyle for not making as much as you and I don't see why: if you don't want to be his friend, just break it off. No need to play these weird manipulative games.", "YTA, and idk why you came to this thread when you keep trying to argue with folks in the comments. YOU pressured Kyle to commit to the wedding, YOU \"entertained\" the idea of driving in the first place, and YOU welched on the idea of the drive when it was made clear that Kyle was given the impression that the driving plan was locked and loaded. Yes, Kyle is an adult, but that doesn't make you or your friends any less of AHs for the way you handled the situation and your \"too bad, so sad\" attitudes.", "yeah, yta. You guilted someone into attending an event they couldn't afford, then offered a way to save a bit of the money wasted on that and now you're planning on withdrawing that offer.", "YTA you pressured your friend into saying they will go by alluding to making the drive with them and you say they would be a douche for not attending but you yourself are not willing to do the drive you are expecting them to do? \n\nIf you had just been upfront about flying from the start and not guilt tripped them then it would be NAH.

You are a bad friend to Kyle.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't need to guilt people to attend weddings.

You guilt your friend into agreeing to something he states he cannot afford and once you do, you pull the rug out and tell him you're not doing that plan after. You are incredibly condescending about your friend because you're in cORpoRaTE fInAnCe and you say he needs to be a big boy? You know what's actually being a big boy? Not going into debt for a party.

It\u2019s been extremely expensive between hotels and the bachelor party and whatnot. That\u2019s why myself, Rod, and Kyle have been thinking about driving. Important detail is Rod and myself make significantly more money than Kyle. Kyle works an entry-ish level job and Rod and I are in corporate finance. \n\nKyle told us all he wasn\u2019t going to the wedding because he couldn\u2019t afford it. We guilted him into making something work because it\u2019s one of our great friends and Kyle would be a total douche if he didn\u2019t go. Kyle cannot afford a plane ticket and since Rod and I spent so much already, we started to entertain the idea of driving. \n\nKyle is all on board to drive and is ready to go. Well the trip is only going to be from Thursday to Sunday. The drive is also 9 hours. That is going to make Thursday and Sunday terrible for us. Especially since we all work Monday. After talking to other friends and family, Rod and I decided that we should just fly. \n\nSo now Rod and I need to talk to Kyle. We are worried that if we fly, Kyle won\u2019t attend the wedding because he won\u2019t drive 9 hours alone. I feel really bad cuz I want Kyle there and I know the groom does, but that drive sounds awful and I can afford to not do it. \n\nMy friends have said Kyle is a big boy and doesn\u2019t need his hand held the entire time (which honestly that\u2019s what it seems like) and that he\u2019s had more than enough time to figure out transportation so if he can\u2019t go that\u2019s all his fault. \n\nWe didn\u2019t confirm 100% that we\u2019d drive but we told Kyle we are heavily leaning toward it. Now would we be assholes for going back on it, flying, and most likely leaving Kyle without a ride ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It sounds like you don't even have friends, you just have people you talk to so that you can show off how \"well\" you're doing.

No one is saying that you are. \n\nIt\u2019s insanely fucked up for you to belittle and name call him for not being able to afford a plane ticket. It is also insanely fucked up for you to infantilize him and make it sound like he is looking for others to take care of him, when he made the financially responsible decision not to go *and you guilted him into going on the premise of driving.*  \n\nIf you are actually his friend and actually want him at the wedding, you will either drive or you\u2019ll use some of your big boy finance money to buy him a plane ticket to fly with you and Rod.
