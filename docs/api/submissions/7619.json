Where I grew up is across the country and much more rural than where we live currently and where my wife grew up. We decided to go see a play in a nearby city that my wife has been wanting to see and we were running a little late because she didn't get ready on time and we're in a rush.\n\nA few minutes into the drive, I saw a funeral procession coming down the road towards us so I pulled over and put my hazards on. My wife then asks me what I'm doing? I tell her that a funeral procession is passing by so I have to pull over. She asks why and says that it isn't against the law to keep driving. I say that I know it isn't against the law, but it is a sign of respect that I've always been taught to do. She then starts to get irritated and says that if we sit and wait for them to pass, then we are going to miss the show and they won't let us in. I said that maybe it is just a cultural difference, and I am truly sorry if we miss the play, but this is something I feel strongly about and I'm not going to move until they have passed. My wife then gets even angrier and says she doesn't understand why I have to act this way.\n\nI then tried to explain myself as best as I could. I told her that some of those people in that line are currently having the worst day of their life. They are on their way to say goodbye forever to someone they love. Having been there before, it can be infuriating watching the world continue to go on as normal as your life is being shattered. Why isn't the rest of the world mourning a beautiful life being taken away. In that short ride between the funeral and the grave, our local culture acknowledges this unfairness. I pointed at the cars behind us and said that each of those people have places they need to be as well. By stopping, we are saying to the grieving, \"We may not have known the deceased, but we will acknowledge both them and your grief by putting our lives on hold for 5-10 minutes while you pass.\" I have been in that line before and this simple act by others meant a lot to me.\n\nMy wife just argued that I was putting the feelings of complete strangers over her and I knew how much she wanted to see this play and I was taking that away from her for people I don't even know. I stood my ground and didn't move. By the time it had passed, there was no chance we would make the play so we went home. My wife is still angry at me and wants me to apologize, which I did for her having missed something she was looking forward to, but said I would still do it again. \n\ntl;Dr: I made us miss a play because I pulled over for a funeral procession.", "created_utc": 1674007537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10euwfr/aita_for_pulling_over_for_a_funeral_procession/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I live in the South, where it's the custom. If no one else was pulled over, it sounds like you were trying to start your own cultural tradition. And it didn't do much for your marriage! I suspect a bit of passive-aggressive behavior here. Your wife caused a delay in starting out, so was this your way of teaching her a lesson? Or were you so uncomfortable at the thought of arriving late that this seemed like a convenient way to go home and avoid that.

Yes, some people have to yield to the procession - but everyone else should just keep the traffic flowing.  \n\nWhenever I've been in a funeral procession, I've not been in a mood to pay attention to whatever I was passing by.

Where I'm from it would be unusual to stop in your situation (since they were coming from the opposite direction) but it is still a very nice thing to do and you would never be an AH for doing it. I understand your wife's initial frustration but once you explained and she kept arguing with you she became TA. Moreso because you were running late because of her.\n\nTo clarify so people don't think I'm an asshole ruining funeral processions: We absolutely do not get in front of a funeral procession where I'm from. You don't ever obstruct one or break the line by turning across it or pulling into the procession. But we wouldn't stop if one were coming the opposite way unless to allow them to turn left or something. But I'm not from a tiny rural town, so it's probably cultural differences.", "NTA.

Does sound like a cultural difference here, so I won't say Y T A, but since it's not my culture, if you stopped for a funeral, while I do understand it on a cultural level, since we're running late and it's not my cultural, I would also probably be angry too.\n\nYeah yeah, she was dragging with her preparation, easy to scapegoat that, but if you ignored the procession too, you'd probably have been on time too, so I won't just point fingers at her, I think. She'll probably never think she's to blame just because she dragged with makeup, so that's a lost battle.\n\nConclusion: I wouldn't commit to being right in this one, because her POV is just as valid imo. No one finds it morally reprehensible to keep driving and make your appointment. At the very least, I would say apologize to your wife, but still stress that you'd probably do the same thing again. The fact that you're unmovable on this matter is probably just as much an issue and between the both of you, someone's gotta give before asking the other to yield ground too.\n\nI'm no stranger to cultural clashes, both my wife and I are from different countries, yielding ground to ask the other to yield ground does wonders for conflict resolution.\n\nSo yeah, NTA, but you two gotta ditch your pride and conflict resolve, probably.", "Death is deeply moving each time. Sounds like you're operating at a slightly deeper level than your wife. You don't have to judge her for it (not saying you are), but could be good to keep in mind going forward that there may be some deeper aspects of life she doesn't quite get yet. And probably can't be explained to her. She may have to learn these things through personal experience and pain. \n\nMy dad once said to me, \"People can't help how deep they are just as much as they can't help their height.

In my jurisdiction you would get a citation for not pulling over even in the opposite direction. Even if you are stopped at a light that turns green but if there is a funeral procession you are NOT allowed to proceed through the green light because the procession has the right of way. \nMay not be the law where this happened but he stopped and pulled over as in his culture it\u2019s respectful.  That was engrained in my culture as well so yes I would pull over regardless if I\u2019m running late or not.  If the play was so important to the wife she should have been ready earlier not to make a 5-10 minute delay to cause them to miss the play. What if there was a vehicle that broke down with a flat tire or a collision?  Or if a rural road even a stray animal?  \nRegardless my vote is NTA.   Wife is allowed to be upset for missing the play but she needs to look at her part of the reason they missed the play as well and not just put the blame on him", "Wife is just demanding that husband drive the car like normal. That\u2019s not any sort of moral stance. He\u2019s pulling over unnecessarily to appease strangers. I cannot stand people like that. Not when it\u2019s to the detriment of their loved ones.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s obnoxious what he did. It was probably some passive aggressive shit because he was annoyed that she is always running late.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Unless it's a super rural road and there's no evident division. \n\nPersonally I've only stopped for these if they're on my direction or if I'm in their way such as cross-traffic or similar.\n\nBut either way, I avoid being in their path. I have always been taught that anything I do which can break the procession, is rude. So this includes being in between cars. \n\nIf they're accompanied by a peace officer. I follow their hand signals.", "I\u2019m telling you as someone who commutes in Los Angeles several times a week, I rarely encounter a 10 minute delay. I\u2019m not saying it has never happened; but it is quite rare. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been running late for things. It happens to everyone. If you were running late for the airport, would you still want your husband to pull over for the funeral?", "Funeral procession was coming from the opposite direction. There is no right of way to yield, unless directed by traffic officers.", "What is your idea of rare?", "No reason to be condescending. I\u2019ve never seen a funeral procession drive as fast as an ambulance. Generally, the sense of urgency has already been removed by the time the funeral occurs.", "OP was driving the opposite direction from the funeral procession. And those processions drive slowly, so even if he'd been going the same direction he wouldn't have needed to stop.", "No", "Where I grew up they would stop traffic on both sides of the road at the funeral home when the procession was leaving and at the graveyard when the procession arrived. There would also be a police car at the head and rear of the procession to keep the cars together. Sometimes they might stop traffic on side roads so no other cars turned in and got mixed in with the procession.", "Depends on the procession.  I've seen more than one that went from the chapel in front to the field in back, no hearse.  I saw one that crossed all of Somerset.  That one was a state patrol funeral, so traffic was super blocked on that one.", "The rules for a funeral procession aren\u2019t the same as emergency vehicles. Find me a state where this is the case. Giving the right away is not the same as having to pull over for a vehicle that is not in your path.\n\nJust to be clear: if a funeral procession is behind you and not overtaking you, you do not have to pull over. If A funeral procession is driving in the opposite direction and not turning left in front of you, you do not have to pull over.\n\nIf you are on a directly converging path with a funeral procession, you most likely have to yield; and this is certainly the case if the procession has a motorcycle escort.\n\nYour argument about leaving early is useless. Everybody has situations where they don\u2019t leave on time for a variety of reasons.\n\nTBH, the argument is moot. What if the OP had already incurred a serious delay from an accident or something else through no fault of his wife?", "That's a pretty weird read into this. It is a cultural norm where I live. There were several other cars pulled over behind us doing the same thing and it has always been that way.", "We can't possibly know what his motivation was, we're not mind readers. He states that this practice is normal to him, so the wife is directly asking him to go against his moral code. Don't impose your morals, or lack of, on others, per your own words.", "you seem pretty insufferable and obnoxious and honestly just really selfish. also making assumptions about OP doing this bc his wife was running late? that's horrible. you literally didn't even get that from anywhere. OP literally explained in the post they did it bc they have lost a person and been in a precession. god. you need to think about other people, pal.", "He said it was \u201ccoming toward us.\u201c Highly unlikely he would see a funeral procession behind him. If anything, he would say \u201cfuneral procession was behind us.\u201d", "Hard to put a number to, but I'd guess on average id hit one every 2 weeks or so.   People definitely factored that in when planning drive times.  Heck, it was in the inbrief at my job that 'this happens.  Allow for it so you aren't late '\n\nNot sure why the difference between there and LA.  Just thought I'd point out your experience wasn't universal, a d that there at least some areas where 10 isn't that crazy to see.", "It's called being respectful of your fellow human beings, a human being passed away and their family was mourning, the fact that I'm having to explain this to you is a problem, but unfortunately a common one at that, people are too self-centred it seems and don't stop to think about the world and people around them, even if those people are strangers they still deserve our care and respect", "Who said I was in the USA?   As far as I know there are many other countries that have traffic laws and contrary to your belief there ARE places that DO treat funerals as emergency vehicles.   (The cars and limos and hearse owned and used by funeral homes even have purple flashing lights on them)\nArgument isn\u2019t mute.   The question is was he wrong for pulling over, which IMO No.   you want to blame someone blame the wife for not being ready on time and already and making them run late with no guarantee they would make the play on time anyways.", "That guy is just obnoxious. You're NTA at all, in my area people would probably take notice of the vehicle that isn't pulled over and if they ever cross paths again that person should be ready for a bad day lol", "Just to clarify. Was the funeral procession coming from the opposite direction or was it in your same direction but behind you?  And was it accompanied by escort officers?", "We could definitely know what his motivation was, because he stated in the OP.\n\nHe wanted to show respect.\n\nWife wanted him to keep driving toward the play like normal.  That\u2019s not imposing anything.", "I don\u2019t really give a shit what you think about me personally. This isn\u2019t my post. You\u2019re not here to give opinions on fellow posters. You\u2019re here to give your opinion on the OP and other characters in the story. But feel free to have a negative opinion of me. I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nAs to my comments: it was speculative. It\u2019s certainly not unheard of for people to be passive aggressive in order to teach their partner a lesson. Rest assured that you are in no way obligated to agree with everything I say\ud83d\udc4d", "Two 10-minute delays in a month is pretty rare. That\u2019s not something anyone should be expected to plan for on their way to a concert, especially when the delay is is self inflicted.\n\nBut it\u2019s about what I would\u2019ve estimated for my own experience.", "No they don\u2019t. They are complete strangers. Every day you read about people who died in car crashes and robberies. Do you stop what you\u2019re doing for ten minutes on their behalf too?\n\nIf you were running late for work or to catch a flight, would you want your Uber driver to pull over for 10 minutes?", "Then why make a judgement statement about passive aggression? To him stopping was normal. It seems that your set on imposing your own values on this man. Which is fine, you can think it's ridiculous, but don't then say that he shouldn't impose his morals on others.", "actually i totally can and will give opinions on you bc you said something on the internet in a forum about opinions! rest assured you are selfish and im not the only one who thinks so! \n\nas for your comment, it was ridiculous and you had no reason to speculate that other than you had no actual reason to call OP TA besides the fact that he wasnt self centered like you?", "Who said anything about pulling over for 10 minutes? You're literally making that up, if there was a funeral procession I would be absolutely a-ok with my taxi driver pulling over, yes\n\nThe fact that you just said \"strangers don't deserve our care and respect\" says just about everything wrong about our society, people like you make it a much worse place to live, I'm done with this conversation, goodbye", "actually i do give a moment of silence bc im actually someone who cares about my fellow human being.", " I am allowed to speculate on the reason he did what he did. You don\u2019t have to agree with it.  What values am I imposing on him?", "The OP said he pulled over for up to 10 minutes.  funny how judgmental you are. I\u2019m a very considerate person. But no, I don\u2019t pull over for people who are behind me or going in the other direction and who won\u2019t be affected by my actions.\n\nAnd I think you are flat out lying if you say you would be willing to miss your flight or be late to work for a funeral procession.\n\nEdit:  and for someone who likes to preach about respect, you certainly don\u2019t show it. You\u2019ve insulted me in multiple posts now.", "cap"]}
