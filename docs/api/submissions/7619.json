Where I grew up is across the country and much more rural than where we live currently and where my wife grew up. We decided to go see a play in a nearby city that my wife has been wanting to see and we were running a little late because she didn't get ready on time and we're in a rush.\n\nA few minutes into the drive, I saw a funeral procession coming down the road towards us so I pulled over and put my hazards on. My wife then asks me what I'm doing? I tell her that a funeral procession is passing by so I have to pull over. She asks why and says that it isn't against the law to keep driving. I say that I know it isn't against the law, but it is a sign of respect that I've always been taught to do. She then starts to get irritated and says that if we sit and wait for them to pass, then we are going to miss the show and they won't let us in. I said that maybe it is just a cultural difference, and I am truly sorry if we miss the play, but this is something I feel strongly about and I'm not going to move until they have passed. My wife then gets even angrier and says she doesn't understand why I have to act this way.\n\nI then tried to explain myself as best as I could. I told her that some of those people in that line are currently having the worst day of their life. They are on their way to say goodbye forever to someone they love. Having been there before, it can be infuriating watching the world continue to go on as normal as your life is being shattered. Why isn't the rest of the world mourning a beautiful life being taken away. In that short ride between the funeral and the grave, our local culture acknowledges this unfairness. I pointed at the cars behind us and said that each of those people have places they need to be as well. By stopping, we are saying to the grieving, \"We may not have known the deceased, but we will acknowledge both them and your grief by putting our lives on hold for 5-10 minutes while you pass.\" I have been in that line before and this simple act by others meant a lot to me.\n\nMy wife just argued that I was putting the feelings of complete strangers over her and I knew how much she wanted to see this play and I was taking that away from her for people I don't even know. I stood my ground and didn't move. By the time it had passed, there was no chance we would make the play so we went home. My wife is still angry at me and wants me to apologize, which I did for her having missed something she was looking forward to, but said I would still do it again. \n\ntl;Dr: I made us miss a play because I pulled over for a funeral procession.\n\nEdit: I honestly never expected to wake up to this many comments. While I am fully ready to accept my judgement, I would just like to say that I did not do this to \"teach my wife a lesson\" as a lot of people seem to think. This is something that I have always done as well as everyone I know from my town.\n\nEdit 2: I've read through pretty much all of the comments and this really seems to be a matter of cultural differences. Everyone is free to their own opinions of course, but it is a little hurtful to read all the comments saying that I just did this out of spite. It may be unbelievable to some, but this practice is followed by practically everyone where I'm from. I've on occasion been late to different things in my life due to it, and all I've ever had to say is \"Sorry I stopped for a funeral procession\" and everyone immediately understood. If you want to call me an asshole anyway, I won't argue. I just don't want judgement passed based on motives prescribed to me that simply are not true.", "created_utc": 1674007537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10euwfr/aita_for_pulling_over_for_a_funeral_procession/", "score": 7801, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s no conflict of who has right-of-way here.  It\u2019s probably better that you don\u2019t stop, since now traffic behind you has to go around you, without interrupting the funeral procession.  You\u2019ve made yourself a road obstacle.

I live in the South, where it's the custom. If no one else was pulled over, it sounds like you were trying to start your own cultural tradition. And it didn't do much for your marriage! I suspect a bit of passive-aggressive behavior here. Your wife caused a delay in starting out, so was this your way of teaching her a lesson? Or were you so uncomfortable at the thought of arriving late that this seemed like a convenient way to go home and avoid that. If this is typical, you two had better get couples' counseling ASAP.", "NTA.

Where I'm from it would be unusual to stop in your situation (since they were coming from the opposite direction) but it is still a very nice thing to do and you would never be an AH for doing it. I understand your wife's initial frustration but once you explained and she kept arguing with you she became TA. Moreso because you were running late because of her.\n\nTo clarify so people don't think I'm an asshole ruining funeral processions: We absolutely do not get in front of a funeral procession where I'm from. You don't ever obstruct one or break the line by turning across it or pulling into the procession. But we wouldn't stop if one were coming the opposite way unless to allow them to turn left or something. But I'm not from a tiny rural town, so it's probably cultural differences.", "NTA.

Does sound like a cultural difference here, so I won't say Y T A, but since it's not my culture, if you stopped for a funeral, while I do understand it on a cultural level, since we're running late and it's not my cultural, I would also probably be angry too.\n\nYeah yeah, she was dragging with her preparation, easy to scapegoat that, but if you ignored the procession too, you'd probably have been on time too, so I won't just point fingers at her, I think. She'll probably never think she's to blame just because she dragged with makeup, so that's a lost battle.\n\nConclusion: I wouldn't commit to being right in this one, because her POV is just as valid imo. No one finds it morally reprehensible to keep driving and make your appointment. At the very least, I would say apologize to your wife, but still stress that you'd probably do the same thing again. The fact that you're unmovable on this matter is probably just as much an issue and between the both of you, someone's gotta give before asking the other to yield ground too.\n\nI'm no stranger to cultural clashes, both my wife and I are from different countries, yielding ground to ask the other to yield ground does wonders for conflict resolution.\n\nSo yeah, NTA, but you two gotta ditch your pride and conflict resolve, probably.", "Death is deeply moving each time. Sounds like you're operating at a slightly deeper level than your wife.

And probably can't be explained to her. She may have to learn these things through personal experience and pain. \n\nMy dad once said to me, \"People can't help how deep they are just as much as they can't help their height.

The town my husband grew up in was the more populated town (off an interstate ramp so it had fast food) about 15 minutes from where we are now and 15 minutes from where I grew up (driving).  It has about 7k now and they just put in more housing on some farmland they bought.  \n\nI remember at the four way in my hometown (I can say that because it was pretty much the ONLY four way stop in the whole town, so it was identifiable by just saying the four way) no one would go until the whole procession was through.  Another reason people do this is because a lot of the cemeteries that aren't in town are alllll over the place and hard to get to.  Out in the country gps doesn't always work, so you don't want to get separated from your group.  It's also because of narrow roads in some areas which would make it hard to have people going in both directions.  If an officer saw you going sometimes they'd join you.  \n\nI have lived in big cities too but I never came across a funeral procession so I never thought about how different the ritual/tradition would be.  Idk if it was illegal where I lived/live, but people would DEFINITELY notice and remember a vehicle/person that didn't pay their respects by stopping.  In small towns that's just a recipe for being a target of gossip", "If. You must be forgetting how rural some parts of the US are. Hell, I grew up in New York and 100,000 people would have been half of the county\u2019s population.

I don't see a funeral procession catching up to you from behind unless you're sat in slow traffic or at lights. And then, genuine question, what's the etiquette there?

If someone can't get their shit together in time (we've all been there), they don't get to disrupt everyone else that could.  \n\nThat being said, it depends on the venue.  I had season tickets for hockey, and they wouldn't let anyone into seating while the puck is in play.  Some people would go apeshit, but the ushers never budged.  They'd complain about buying a ticket and missing the action.  But THEY chose to leave the game to do whatever, probably disrupting people on the way and making them miss the action, and now they want to do it again and the ushers don't let them.  And that is just a hockey game, which is kind of loud and chaotic anyway and you wouldn't disrupt the players in any case.\n\nI go to two movie theaters specifically because they do not seat people late (plus, they actually kick people out for texting and being on their phone).  They don't do a lot of indie films, so when I go to other theaters, it is crazy how self-entitled and rude people are.\n\nWe also attend a lot of live theater and orchestra/symphony/opera.  They all *say* they won't seat late.  But most just keep the doors closed and let people in between scenes/songs.  Only one place consistently prevents latecomers from entering, and even then you can hang out until intermission and get in, which is fine if you just want to see a friend perform but I'd probably just leave if I missed the first half of any of them.", "I'm not overlooking it, I just don't think it's relevant. Cultural practices are not something you can force on to someone and negatively impact them. If he wants to make himself late for things by observing this cultural practise I have no problem with that. It's that his culture knowingly had a negative impact on his wife's ability to make the play (and probably their marriage too).\n\nFor example, where I'm from Diwali celebrations last year got way out of hand with massive fireworks displays going way past midnight and leaving literal clouds of smoke over urban centres. Despite it being part of a cultural tradition many municipalities amended their fireworks bylaws to scale down these celebrations.

A life can never come back. The respect you showed will come back to you. I just hope your shallow, selfish wife learns to earn you. Well done", "No. Not at all. That\u2019s totally normal. Not to sound like an asshole (meta I know), but it sounds kind of like a dick move by your wife to worry you\u2019re going to just be a couple minutes late. Showing respect for the dead > being a minute or two late. \n\nUnless it\u2019s like some celebrity, processions aren\u2019t like forever long. It\u2019d be one thing if it was like 30 minutes but most processions (that I\u2019ve seen, maybe I\u2019m an outlier) aren\u2019t but just a couple minutes.", "I live in the south.  We pull over for funeral processions even on the opposition side of the road even when it\u2019s a divided highway.  It\u2019s a way to honor the dead and say to the grieving family we support you and we acknowledge your loss.  \n\nThe rest of you don\u2019t have to like it. That\u2019s what I do.  It\u2019s not abnormal here and people talk big smack about the ones who don\u2019t stop.  The only super long ones I\u2019ve seen were for military, law enforcement or fire fighters generally killed in action. Those are super long and are usually taken on a route that affords more places for people to come to the side of the road to wait and show their condolences. \n\nI would have done exactly what OP did.", "Holy shit. OP is a fucking maniac. I'm revoking my nta, this isn't respect for the deceased, it's a weird ass power play.", "OP acts like their past posts can't be undone, as minimal as they are. I wanna lowkey know the wifes side.", "Yeah I didn't really expect so many N T A on this one. I mean, cultural thing or not, this is not a good reason to miss an event. Those people will carry on doing what they need to with or without some random guy pulling over for them. I'd be pissed too if I were his wife. She shares the blame for being late, of course, but ultimately they missed the event because OP just had to do something unnecessary for everyone involved.", "I live in a city (Canada) & it is a thing we are all taught to do here as well. Sometimes there\u2019s even a light flashing and the road will be physically blocked off by people to force everyone to stop and wait.", "NTA.  It does mean so much.  My uncle died at 21.  The whole town showed up and both the procession and the line along both sides of the road was enormous.  Hats in hand by the side of the road.  Two years later my grandfather died and the same thing happened.", "It can be so overwhelming to see how people made a difference to others. My dad was just a guy. He could fix your car and build your house, the whole thing, from construction to electrical to plumbing. He lived in the mid-sized city he grew up in. \n\nWhen we had his wake we had a line out the door, a full lobby and parking lot. My mom was utterly flabbergasted on top of the shock. \n \nEveryone from grade school friends, trade buddies, distant family we Never saw, people whose houses he'd built, restaurant and store owners he worked with, staff at places he frequently went, my classmates and their parents, the whole pta, my teachers and principal, and even a few of the nurses from the cardiac unit who were shocked someone so young had died there. All on top of the friends and family we knew well. It was way more than expected for a guy who spent most weeks working 60 hours and coming home to rest and play with me. Sometimes we don't know just how many lives we've touched until you see the tally at the end.", "I've seen this, on the interstate, for KIA military transports home. People lining the streets in town, Emergency/police vehicles on every overpass for, at least, 40 miles, and a full motorcade and motorcycle escort. If I said I wasn't bawling alone in my car I would be lying. And yes, I pulled over on the interstate for the procession to pass.", "NTA- I guess I was raised in a different time, it\u2019s something we have always done, and I will continue to do. I think what you did was the right thing absolutely and the fact that your wife has so little compassion and understanding is kind of sad. \n\nThe bottom line to me is if a matter of 10 minutes meant you guys were not going to make a play, then she holds some responsibility for being that late. please continue to do this, it\u2019s a wonderful show of respect in an ever increasing world that seems to not care for anyone but themselves.", "My great uncle was the chief of the volunteer fire department in our small town. At his funeral there were fire trucks and ambulances from our town and all of the neighboring small towns lining the streets (and most of the local volunteer firefighters and EMTs were present for the funeral as well). \n\nI went to high school (and therefore learned to drive) in a larger suburb (so I hadn't ingrained this into my driving habits), but boy did my grandma set me straight when I was driving with her in our home town and didn't initially pull over for a funeral.", "In my town they are paying attention 100%. I\u2019ve had conversations with people talking about how they couldn\u2019t believe a car didn\u2019t pull over and how offensive that is", "Can confirm- live in SW VA and we had to bury my grandfather a few months ago. Funeral procession with full military honors. Both lanes pulled over where it was safe to do so. \n\nThe way I was taught- if you see a funeral procession, or if there's an ambulance/firetruck running with lights: if you can safely pull over long enough for them to pass, then please do. \nIt gives them all one less thing to focus on, even if for just a moment, as a means of support. \n\nPeople in the procession are mourning the loss of someone close to them. \nEmergency services is trying to get to people in time to save/help them (and inadvertently prevent more funeral processions).", "In a small, rural town like the one OP is describing, everyone knows each other. There is a VERY good chance you know whose funeral it is. I had cousins in a small town (current population: 421) and this was a normal occurrence.", "I'm not crying. \nYou're crying.", "The street my grandmother lived on was SILENT while she was on hospice, bc adults had told the kids mrs so and so was sick. They sent up lanterns the night she died. These little community things are sweet. \n\nIn a bigger community I don\u2019t think pulling over is necessary, and as a cold hearted new englander I could see getting irritated if we had time sensitive plans, but I don\u2019t see ASSHOLE. this is a cultural difference.", "Another example of how blessed we are to have dogs.", "I think this might be another case of what polite looks like in rural vs urban norms where rural areas are looking at how you're affecting the person you're immediately interacting with (the funeral procession in this case) and urban manners being much more focused on how your actions are affecting everyone in your surroundings (ie all the traffic behind you). Like of COURSE you don't pull over in NYC where traffic is already a nightmare, but there won't be nearly that volume of other cars in a small town in the south.", "Yeah I grew up in Jersey and live in Maryland and have never heard of this and especially not for the other direction. The only time I\u2019ve pulled over was state police procession and that\u2019s because they literally take over the whole beltway.", "I grew up in the south and have never even heard of this.", "Not entirely weird. Many years ago my best friend was killed in an accident, her funeral was very formal and I definitely felt it was disrespectful because a priest who didn't know her was telling us what was special about her. Felt very disrespectful, but obviously the parents wanted that type of funeral. I can see the same feeling applying here.", "A funeral procession is just the hearse and mourners driving from the house of worship to the cemetery. Sometimes old or small or rural churches stand in their cemeteries, but usually they're distant. \n\nThe procession drives with their lights on and a little flags to indicate that they are part of the procession, and whether or not you pull over, you are not supposed to merge through the procession if you're not part of it.\n\nIf it's long enough, they will often contract with police officers to drive into an intersection and stop cross-traffic, because the funeral procession will not stop for red lights.\n\nThe most impressive are for [fallen police officers](https://youtu.be/5mmdiFOgL5E) and [firefighters](https://youtu.be/SyX51mJhweg). Members of that profession [from all over the country](https://www.wvxu.org/local-news/2015-03-30/symbolism-and-tradition-at-firefighter-funeral?_amp=true) will come if they are not on duty. Firefighters from nearby communities will cover shifts in the fallen one's city so his coworkers can attend.  \n\n> Two hundred firefighters from Columbus and other local departments will be working in Cincinnati on Wednesday so that local firefighters can attend the funeral of Daryl Gordon, who died in the line of duty last Thursday. \n\n...\n\n> An estimated 3,500 firefighters from around the country are expected at the funeral.  Stern says Detroit, Cleveland, Ann Arbor, and Indianapolis are all sending busloads of firefighters.  He says he received a call from Birmingham, England, asking about arrangements and how they could send a representative.", "That\u2019s lovely. I wish more communities did this. Thank you for warming my heart!", "I'm not a vet but raised in a military family and have lived by the \"15 min early is on time\" rule for as long as I can remember. If somebody doesn't want to leave early with me, I'll leave without them. Idgaf. They can get caught up in traffic without me", "You\u2019re also more likely to know the decedent and/or their family and friends in a rural, less populous area. So a custom that may have started because everyone on the road knew the family, carries on in perpetuity as a sign of respect.", "My grandpa was kind of the same, a farmer during the week, but he played music at basically every wedding for a good 40 years within 3/4 hours of transit, the amount of people that got to the funneral was kinda insane ( in a village of 500~ inhabitants, seeing the whole village, and by that i mean, every street, windows, every bench with people standing in grief ) truly a role model and a great person\n\n( I'm tearing out so much writing that, damnit )", "> He was a farmer.\n\nOh, well, that explains it. Farmers are so often the pillars of their community, because they are always outstanding in their field. \n\nSorry, old joke. Your uncle sounds wonderful.", "Hell, not even just rural. I live in a decent sized city and you pull over for processions. We were literally taught that in Driver's Ed. Not to mention, here they have police escorts who will stop traffic at intersections for them.", "We have a railway that regularly blocks a major road for 5-10 minutes at a time. You never know what could cause a delay, and OP's wife should know better than to cut her timing so close for something that important. \n\nNTA.", "For oncoming emergency vehicles you\u2019re supposed to either do nothing if it\u2019s a divided highway, or drive slowly closer to your curb on the right if it\u2019s undivided. We\u2019re taught to never stop for oncoming traffic unless they have to cross the midline in an emergency.\n\nEdit: notable exception is school bus", "I've seen it happen both ways, just depended on the people ahead of the procession.\n\nI've also seen the local police department in town block all intersections  and the road right at the church until the funeral had passed through.", "I agree. With the exception of cops and local bigwigs a funeral procession usually takes like 3 minutes. I don't get why they didn't just go on to the play. There's a decent chance they could have still gotten in, and if they hadn't at least they tried. Might as well at least get dinner or go see a movie or something after all that time spent getting dressed up.", "It also depends on the size of the venue. \n\nFancy, large venues often have a screen so you can watch from outside if you have to leave the theater; unless you're in a very small black box-type venue, ushers can sneak you in without disturbing the show or other audience members.\n\nIf it's a smaller venue and you bought tickets ahead of time, they have your name on the list and they know you're supposed to be there, so they'll hold curtain waiting for you, especially if you call the theater and say you're on your way.\n\nMany venues hold for 15-30 minutes past the posted time anyway, because they know people are running late.", "I am confused about that. If they were gonna be say, ten minutes late, lots of plays do start a few minutes late just for stragglers like OP."]}
