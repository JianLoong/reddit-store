{"id": 7619, "submission_id": "10euwfr", "title": "AITA for pulling over for a funeral procession?", "selftext": "My wife and I went back to my hometown to visit my family this week. Where I grew up is across the country and much more rural than where we live currently and where my wife grew up. We decided to go see a play in a nearby city that my wife has been wanting to see and we were running a little late because she didn't get ready on time and we're in a rush.\n\nA few minutes into the drive, I saw a funeral procession coming down the road towards us so I pulled over and put my hazards on. My wife then asks me what I'm doing? I tell her that a funeral procession is passing by so I have to pull over. She asks why and says that it isn't against the law to keep driving. I say that I know it isn't against the law, but it is a sign of respect that I've always been taught to do. She then starts to get irritated and says that if we sit and wait for them to pass, then we are going to miss the show and they won't let us in. I said that maybe it is just a cultural difference, and I am truly sorry if we miss the play, but this is something I feel strongly about and I'm not going to move until they have passed. My wife then gets even angrier and says she doesn't understand why I have to act this way.\n\nI then tried to explain myself as best as I could. I told her that some of those people in that line are currently having the worst day of their life. They are on their way to say goodbye forever to someone they love. Having been there before, it can be infuriating watching the world continue to go on as normal as your life is being shattered. Why isn't the rest of the world mourning a beautiful life being taken away. In that short ride between the funeral and the grave, our local culture acknowledges this unfairness. I pointed at the cars behind us and said that each of those people have places they need to be as well. By stopping, we are saying to the grieving, \"We may not have known the deceased, but we will acknowledge both them and your grief by putting our lives on hold for 5-10 minutes while you pass.\" I have been in that line before and this simple act by others meant a lot to me.\n\nMy wife just argued that I was putting the feelings of complete strangers over her and I knew how much she wanted to see this play and I was taking that away from her for people I don't even know. I stood my ground and didn't move. By the time it had passed, there was no chance we would make the play so we went home. My wife is still angry at me and wants me to apologize, which I did for her having missed something she was looking forward to, but said I would still do it again. \n\ntl;Dr: I made us miss a play because I pulled over for a funeral procession.", "created_utc": 1674007537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10euwfr/aita_for_pulling_over_for_a_funeral_procession/", "score": 413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I live in the South, where it's the custom. If no one else was pulled over, it sounds like you were trying to start your own cultural tradition. And it didn't do much for your marriage! I suspect a bit of passive-aggressive behavior here. Your wife caused a delay in starting out, so was this your way of teaching her a lesson? Or were you so uncomfortable at the thought of arriving late that this seemed like a convenient way to go home and avoid that. If this is typical, you two had better get couples' counseling ASAP.", "NTA.

Yes, some people have to yield to the procession - but everyone else should just keep the traffic flowing.  \n\nWhenever I've been in a funeral procession, I've not been in a mood to pay attention to whatever I was passing by.

Where I'm from it would be unusual to stop in your situation (since they were coming from the opposite direction) but it is still a very nice thing to do and you would never be an AH for doing it. I understand your wife's initial frustration but once you explained and she kept arguing with you she became TA. Moreso because you were running late because of her.\n\nTo clarify so people don't think I'm an asshole ruining funeral processions: We absolutely do not get in front of a funeral procession where I'm from. You don't ever obstruct one or break the line by turning across it or pulling into the procession. But we wouldn't stop if one were coming the opposite way unless to allow them to turn left or something. But I'm not from a tiny rural town, so it's probably cultural differences.", "NTA.

Does sound like a cultural difference here, so I won't say Y T A, but since it's not my culture, if you stopped for a funeral, while I do understand it on a cultural level, since we're running late and it's not my cultural, I would also probably be angry too.\n\nYeah yeah, she was dragging with her preparation, easy to scapegoat that, but if you ignored the procession too, you'd probably have been on time too, so I won't just point fingers at her, I think. She'll probably never think she's to blame just because she dragged with makeup, so that's a lost battle.\n\nConclusion: I wouldn't commit to being right in this one, because her POV is just as valid imo. No one finds it morally reprehensible to keep driving and make your appointment. At the very least, I would say apologize to your wife, but still stress that you'd probably do the same thing again. The fact that you're unmovable on this matter is probably just as much an issue and between the both of you, someone's gotta give before asking the other to yield ground too.\n\nI'm no stranger to cultural clashes, both my wife and I are from different countries, yielding ground to ask the other to yield ground does wonders for conflict resolution.\n\nSo yeah, NTA, but you two gotta ditch your pride and conflict resolve, probably.", "Death is deeply moving each time. Sounds like you're operating at a slightly deeper level than your wife. You don't have to judge her for it (not saying you are), but could be good to keep in mind going forward that there may be some deeper aspects of life she doesn't quite get yet. And probably can't be explained to her. She may have to learn these things through personal experience and pain. \n\nMy dad once said to me, \"People can't help how deep they are just as much as they can't help their height.

It\u2019s respect and common decency and where I grew up it\u2019s the NORM not to mention in certain jurisdictions the law.  In certain highway traffic laws it specifically states funeral processions have the right of way AND are treated same as emergency vehicles. And yes if a fire truck is coming toward you on a single lane roadway you aren\u2019t pulling over to give them room?  In my jurisdiction you would get a citation for not pulling over even in the opposite direction. Even if you are stopped at a light that turns green but if there is a funeral procession you are NOT allowed to proceed through the green light because the procession has the right of way. \nMay not be the law where this happened but he stopped and pulled over as in his culture it\u2019s respectful.  That was engrained in my culture as well so yes I would pull over regardless if I\u2019m running late or not.  If the play was so important to the wife she should have been ready earlier not to make a 5-10 minute delay to cause them to miss the play. What if there was a vehicle that broke down with a flat tire or a collision?  Or if a rural road even a stray animal?  \nRegardless my vote is NTA.   Wife is allowed to be upset for missing the play but she needs to look at her part of the reason they missed the play as well and not just put the blame on him", "Wife is just demanding that husband drive the car like normal.

He was a really lovely, caring man who never met a stranger, and everyone adored him.

It was incredibly touching and deeply moving.*\n\nIn rural areas and small towns, this is not extraordinary. I get it: You live in a big city, and no one there gives a flying f---. I live in a big city, too, and people don't stop all traffic for funerals here, either. But when you are in a small town or rural area, people *do* stop. They care. They notice.
