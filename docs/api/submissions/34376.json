Never mind the fact that he apparently doesn't understand that it was too young, but thinking he can put a living animal in a bag and sneak away with it is just appalling. Your sister is out of line, and I'm willing to bet he would be one of those kids who \"plays\" too rough, has no respect or understanding of how to handle or care for a dog, and that poor animal will be mauled, mishandled and traumatized. Respect for a living thing is a basic lesson and skill that children  are able to grasp at a very young age, this kid was either never taught how to behave around an animal, or he doesn't care, which is even worse.", "NTA. If he (and his mother!) see nothing wrong with putting a tiny puppy into a plastic bag to steal and take home when it\u2019s too young to be away from its mother then no, he should not have a puppy.

You can give him a toy dog but not the living puppies", "NTA. You are putting the animal needs first.\n\nHowever, they will get a puppy from somewhere else, and that will be a reminder of what happened for many years. They will not understand your decision, after all it was a mistake (one small one in their eyes, a big one -with possibly more to follow- in your eyes).\n\nI would give this some thinking time for all parties involved.", "NTA. Your nephew is lucky that you got to him before Dove did.\n\nI would text your sister this: the fact that you are getting people to attack me for your son's negative action tells me that I was right to retract my offer. I dont want anything to do with you or Dion.", "NTA\n\nIf he isn't mature enough to realise that he was in effect killing that puppy by stealing it from its mother so early, then he is nowhere near capable of caring for a puppy.

There are so many ways for an animal to get injured around a careless or thoughtless kid. \n\nUntil she was old enough to take an animal's life seriously, we stuck to pets like fish (I cleaned the tank, and there was an auto feeder ...
