Then we heard Dove barking which alerted me to go check on Dion and Dove. Dion was standing the corner with his hands behind his back. We could hear the puppy muffled cries and I pulled him forward and found he had put the puppy in a plastic bag. I told him off and asked him what was he doing? He started crying and said he wanted the puppy now and that he was taking this one home! I told him no, you already know that there to young and that they need there mother milk. Dion had a tantrum. My sister had to take him home. Dove was understandably agitated and was now wary on who comes near her pups. \n\n\nI had decided over a couple of day's that I didn't trust Dion to have one of them.

I said he didn't even apologize! She said what for? The puppy was fine. I got angry then and said what if Dove hadn't alerted us? The puppy could have died! She said I was going to brake his heart if I go back on my promise. I said, I'm sorry but that's my final decision. She left angry.

Never mind the fact that he apparently doesn't understand that it was too young, but thinking he can put a living animal in a bag and sneak away with it is just appalling. Your sister is out of line, and I'm willing to bet he would be one of those kids who \"plays\" too rough, has no respect or understanding of how to handle or care for a dog, and that poor animal will be mauled, mishandled and traumatized. Respect for a living thing is a basic lesson and skill that children  are able to grasp at a very young age, this kid was either never taught how to behave around an animal, or he doesn't care, which is even worse.", "NTA. If he (and his mother!) see nothing wrong with putting a tiny puppy into a plastic bag to steal and take home when it\u2019s too young to be away from its mother then no, he should not have a puppy. You\u2019re looking out for the dog\u2019s safety and wellbeing.", "NTA, he\u2018s a bit dumb for 10, no?", "NTA", "NTA. Dion doesn't realized that the puppy was a living being and not a toy. And the reaction of his mother - trying to guilt you, sending you a message of a crying Dion and so on - shows that she wouldn't stand up if Dion would treat the puppy poorly. You can give him a toy dog but not the living puppies", "NTA. You are putting the animal needs first.\n\nHowever, they will get a puppy from somewhere else, and that will be a reminder of what happened for many years. They will not understand your decision, after all it was a mistake (one small one in their eyes, a big one -with possibly more to follow- in your eyes).\n\nI would give this some thinking time for all parties involved.", "NTA. Your nephew is lucky that you got to him before Dove did.\n\nI would text your sister this: the fact that you are getting people to attack me for your son's negative action tells me that I was right to retract my offer. I dont want anything to do with you or Dion.", "NTA\n\nIf he isn't mature enough to realise that he was in effect killing that puppy by stealing it from its mother so early, then he is nowhere near capable of caring for a puppy. He will kill it through sheer ignorance, and his mother is just the same. Neither of them are safe to be around animals for a long time.", "Nta. Do NOT relent and give them a puppy. Your nephew seems the kind of kid that will ignore the dog once the \"shiny new puppy feeling\" fades, and it'll likely end up at the shelter.

You can't count on her to protect the pup properly.", "Well, I was in camp Dion right up until the last sentence!

You\u2019re not obligated place a puppy into a home where they might not be looked after. I can understand a 10yo making a mistake, but your sisters attitude that he had nothing to apologise for is more concerning. IF your sis had come back and said Dion knows he did wrong and is very very sorry and we are going to teach him how to be a good puppy owner then you might have been being harsh. But the acceptance of his behaviour and then the emotional manipulation is not acceptable to me. I think you\u2019re making the right choice", "NTA. A TEN YEAR OLD who thinks it's a good idea to put a living, breathing creature into a plastic bag should NOT have a pet. It's not even about apologising or whatever. If that kid's mentally so immature as not to see why this is a bad idea, they can't be trusted with a pet.

Don\u2019t give him anything", "NTA Stick to your guns. At the age of 10 Dion should know better. His mother is not helping the situation by not recognizing the seriousness, trying to guilt you and then a video where you are calked names, olus trying to get others in on the act to intimidate or belittle you.

Plus he didn\u2019t even apologise for it and instead just threw a tantrum. Your nephew is far too young to be looking after a pup and your sister is untrustworthy as well. She didn\u2019t discipline her child or even correct him on why he shouldn\u2019t of tried to steal a pup. She didn\u2019t even make her kid apologise and basically wrote it off because the puppy ended up okay thanks to you. That\u2019s not someone I would trust with any dog let alone a puppy.", "Absolutely NTA. Your sister saying he 'learnt his lesson' and then not even thinking he had anything to apologise for is wild.\nStay the course. Not only are you right that he can't be trusted (having a pet is a responsibility, and he's shown he can't be responsible) but if he's crying and calling you names, that's just more reason to not give him the puppy (and I'd tell your sister just that, as I assume she's the one filming him)", "Dion is ten. If he didn\u2019t know better then, he won\u2019t know better in a couple of weeks when he could have had his puppy.

While I understand he probably is really excited, a 10yo should know to not put a living animal in a plastic bag.    \nYour sister thinking it is all fine because nothing went wrong is a bit worrying.
