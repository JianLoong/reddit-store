I\u2019ve never understood why people expect the host to give up their own bed for a guest. Yes, be hospitable, but that doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing your own comfort and HEALTH for someone who is an adult and could get a hotel.

Her friend ca share the bed with you.  Problem solved because gf will nope that idea and have her friend on an air mattress or the couch", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be giving up my bed.

They also have an air mattress she can use too.", "I mean we could but it would be tight, I have a king bed in my room and our guest bedroom is a twin, so my and my friend would be sleeping sleeping pretty close together which I feel is weird and it\u2019s his first time visiting so I don\u2019t want for him to have to deal with that. I\u2019d rather him just have his own space to be comfortable in. It\u2019s not like our couch is uncomfortable and we also have an air mattress she can sleep on. My Gf is just being unreasonable, I told her when I found out they were both coming at the same time I wasn\u2019t giving up the bed to sleep on the couch but she offered it to her friend anyway so now I\u2019m even more annoyed and standing my ground.", "I saw that! You're quite right. And I saw that his gf already told her friend that she would have the king, which is bad form.", "NTA. She ignored your clearly stated intent to not give up your bed. At this point, I'd tell her you will be sleeping in your own bed, and it's her choice as to whether she sleeps with you or her friend does.", "Well seeing as you stated your feelings before hand and she still went against it I would the best compromise would be, you and your friend take your room. Your wife and her friend can take the guest bedroom, just put a twin inflatable mattress in the guest bedroom as well.", "The air mattress is good for her friend, in my opinion.", "NTA - My bed is mine.  Unless we're doing the horizontal mambo, you aren't getting in it.", "NTA, your gf shouldn't have offered without discussing it with you first. That's a level of disrespect it's hard to come back from, especially given that she knows you have back issues. Are you sure she's the one?", "Tell your gf she can join her friend on the couch when she comes to stay.\n\nOr if you and your friend are comfortable with it you share your bed, the friend gets the guest room and your gf sleeps on the couch, if she has no problem with you sleeping on the couch then she shouldn't have an issue with sleeping on it herself.", ">I have a bad back and I hate sleeping on the couch\n\nNTA", "NTA. When you're a guest at someone's house, you're kind of at the mercy of the host regarding where you sleep.

No one in my house will ever be displaced from their bed for a guest. No way. Hell, if we have a guest, we make them get a hotel room as we don\u2019t have room for guests.

But unless one of us absolutely has to sleep in a bed , guests get the bed and we take the sofa.", "NTA but personally I hate air beds. \n\nIf the couch has removable cushions, I will take 3-4 of them off & put a single (twin?) fitted sheet around them.

Your gf shouldn't have offered without talking to you. I don't know if you can or want to spend the money but I have an air mattress around for these kinds of situations. Nothing wrong with making your guests comfortable, but giving up your own bed is ridiculous.", "NTA. I don't give my bed to anyone. It's my bed, and if they don't want to sleep on the couch maybe they should get a hotel.", "You're NTA but I'm concerned at the fact that your gf just offered your place in the bed to her friend and after reading comments she did it after you explicitly said you weren't going to do that. Ask her why she feels such a need to share a bed with her friend that she would displace you who pays rent and utilities and are her significant other, just for a bit more comfort for said friend. If I was the friend I'd be absolutely horrified to learn that my friend was kicking her SO to the curb against their explicitly stated wishes because of me.", "NTA but I feel like the female friend probably doesn't feel safe in a room without a proper door.", "NTA  She doesn't pay rent.  Why should she get your bed?  Nope!", "Nta. Tell your gf she is welcome to take the couch & give her spot to her gf but she doesnt get to speak for you. Bet she stops making that offer", "INFO: Why did you guys both agree to host friends at the same time? Did you talk to each other about it? Who made and discussed the plans for having their friend visit first?", "Just invite the friend to sleep on the bed with you, and put the girlfriend on the couch.\n\nThat way, you're comfortable, your girlfriend's friend is comfortable, and your girlfriend is happy that you're being hospitable.\n\nProblem solved.   ;-P", "How long are we talking? Is it like a one or two night thing? \nI totally understand you  but why not let your gf have a sleepover party?", "There are two types of people: one group thinks it\u2019s super weird to have someone else sleep in their bed and wants to be comfortable. The other group thinks that they want to be amazing hosts and prioritize the comfort of the guest over themselves. It\u2019s seen as selfish to prioritize yourself. I don\u2019t think the two groups usually understand the other\u2019s point of view.\n\nPerhaps OP would get further if he made it clear to his GF he understands that she wants to give her guest a good experience. She may also be worried about the optics of letting OP\u2019s buddy get first dibs on the room. OP and gf should talk through options. Maybe both friends don\u2019t have to visit at once? Who asked to visit first? Did you mention to the second person that the regular guest room isn\u2019t available and ask if couch ok? \n\nNTA for wanting your own bed.", "I concur, in this day and age gender should be less of a decider. It's insulting to same-sex couples to be considered lesser.\n\nIf you wouldn't be comfortable with a partner sleeping in the same bed as one gender, the same rule should apply to the others.\n\nSo NTA for me but because it's not ok to be kicked out of your bed so your partner can sleep next to someone else if your in a monogamous relationship.\n\nHim sharing a bed with the her friend shouldn't be any more or less of a concern than her doing so... But frankly just get a decent blow up bed and let her sleep in the living room.", "Exactly what I was thinking. Which friend had the first arrangement to stay? They get the bedroom, the other one gets the couch. You get your bed. NTA", "What do you mean you \u201cfound out\u201d they were both coming at the same time?\n\nDid you two not discuss the plans with each other first?", "YTA.  You guys are the hosts.  What is this, for a few nights? Be a little flexible.", "NTA.\n\nWhose idea was it to have two guests at the same time, anyway? It's ridiculous.\n\nOne of the guests can't stay with you. You choose.\n\nOr your GF can sleep on the couch, since she thinks that's such fun.", "NTA, but there\u2019s a cultural dynamic here that you should probably pay attention to. \nSome places, the host will be offended if you don\u2019t take their bed. This is especially true since the guest that would be taking the couch is female and the guest that would be walking through the common space would be male (and it sounds like they may not know each other?). \nTalk to your girlfriend- it sounds like she offered, the friend didn\u2019t ask. Explain that you\u2019re uncomfortable with the arrangement she made without asking you. Decide together, moving forward, how you\u2019ll handle these situations.", "Yta,\nNot because you don't want to sleep on the couch but because you decided your friend gets the guest room without discussing it first.  You made a decision and your GF felt free to make a decision.", "NTA. Would your buddy be okay taking the couch instead? Why are they visiting at the same time?", "Your girlfriend can sleep on the couch. NTA.", "NTA. Guest should sleep on the couch. I have a bad back, I absolutely cannot sleep on the couch.", "NTA. She\u2019s a guest in YOUR condo. She can sleep on the couch and you can sleep on YOUR bed.", "Why are they coming at the same time? I would just invite them different times explaining that we already had plans for another guest.  If it was me, I would move the visit of the one we see most frequently.", "NTA - Your girlfriend is pretty generous with your bed.  \n\nTell her a big no, girlfriend gets the couch.", "Ask her friend to come at a later date. She\u2019s come over many times she can rearrange her trip to when you have the guest room available.", "I mean. If your couch is so big and comfortable, you should have no problem taking it, right?", "She can offer it all she likes.  You aren't required to give it.  Simple as.", "Gf is control freaking hard.\n\n\"Sorry friend, gf misspoke, you'll be on the couch.\"", "Uhh NO.. why does your gf offer this without clearing it with you first?

On the plus side all of their cats and their German Shepard snuggled up to me", "NTA tell her if she wants her friend to have a comfortable place to sleep SHE can give up her spot n the bed but you will be keeping yours", "I would say ESH since this all should have been clarified prior to agreeing to the arrangements. If the arrangements weren\u2019t made at the same time, I agree with another commenter that whoever decided to come over first should get the guest room, and the other guest should get the couch (rereading it, it sounds like your buddy came first)\n\nUltimately though I am a bit of a softie and think the host-ily thing to do is to ensure that your guests have comfortable sleeping arrangements - if the couch is bad for you, it sounds like it also might be bad for the gf. Question - could you guys get her an air mattress? I feel like that could be a sensible compromise here!", "NTA let your gf know your not offering your bed and her friend will take the couch. It does not make you a bad host for being comfortable where you pay.", "Why can't you sleep with your \"buddy\"?  YTA for expecting a woman guest to sleep in a communal, mixed gender space.

Problem solved.", "Also, does OP\u2019s girlfriend ever stay at the woman\u2019s house and get the friend\u2019s bed?", "this is so over complicated for no reason. it's his house and his bed and he's going to sleep in it. his friend already claimed the guest bed so GF's friend can sleep on the couch. there is no reason to complicate it past that", "Your GF can't give up your sleeping place, just like you can't give up her sleeping place. Tough luck for GFs friend, but IMO, you are not obliged to give up your bed.if GF desperately wants her friend to sleep in a bed, she can either give up her spot (but only with your permission), or let GFs friend go to a hotel.", "Choosing beggars much? \n\nOp isn't forcing anyone to visit. Don't like it, don't visit or postpone your trip", "ah we found the GF, he said he has a bad back. friend does not  \n\n\nalso it's his fucking house and he doesn't need to sleep on the couch back problem or not. this is such a shit comment", "unilateral decisions like that disqualify you from having an opinion imo  \nso fuck what GF wants, OP gets to sleep in his bed because she didn't even ASK before giving up HIS spot in bed", "Love how she voluntold you to sleep on the couch.
