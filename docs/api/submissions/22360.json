My bed is mine and so no one sleeps there but me. If there's a guest, then they can take the couch. Simple as that.", "NTA. Her guests don\u2019t get to displace you. Her friend can easily take the couch.", "NTA. I mean, wtf should you suffer so that her friend can be more comfortable? It's your home. Fuck that shit.", "NTA. I\u2019ve never understood why people expect the host to give up their own bed for a guest. Yes, be hospitable, but that doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing your own comfort and HEALTH for someone who is an adult and could get a hotel. If you feel like compromising, you could offer to get a decent air mattress for the friend if the couch is uncomfortable- but there\u2019s no reason for you to give up your bed.", "Nta , I would NEVER give up my bedroom for anyone. People are weird", "NTA. Maybe get a nice air matras for her friend in the living room", "NTA : Paying your bills and rent deserves respect, indeed. It's important to foster a balanced living environment. Perhaps a fair compromise could be having the girl sleep on the couch while you and your girlfriend enjoy the bed", "NTA. And this idea is weird.", "How does the friend feel? Every time i used to stay with my best friend, she would insist her bf sleep on the couch while we take their room. I would ALWAYS tell her I\u2019d prefer sleeping on the couch alone while she slept in her room with her boyfriend. I HATED that they would argue about where i would sleep when i literally didn\u2019t have a problem with the couch. & NTA btw, it\u2019s your home.", "INFO: Would it be weird for your buddy to sleep with you & your GF & her friend to sleep together?", "Tell your GF her friend can sleep with you and she can have the couch.", "Sleep in the bed with your buddy or try to get the two to hook up lol.\n\nThe proper thing would to have had your gf tell her friend that she is welcome to come but will be on the couch or a blow up mattress. As the guest room will be occupied with bf friend. If your gf was gonna offer your bed, she should have asked you first.", "As it stands I\u2019m stuck nta or yta. Would it be possible to do guys in one room and girls in the other? I mean everyone is adults and this way everyone gets a bed.

OP this is a HUGE red flag. dump her and kick her out IMMEDIATELY. she clearly is using you as a meal ticket", "NTA", "NTA your girlfriend can only offer up her side of the bed and Only if you are okay with who she\u2019s offering it to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don\u2019t want to give up your bed for a guest, that\u2019s your prerogative. She shouldn\u2019t have spoken for you. Sleep in your own bed if you want", "NTA Let gf sleep on the couch.  Her friend ca share the bed with you.  Problem solved because gf will nope that idea and have her friend on an air mattress or the couch", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be giving up my bed. If the couch is unacceptable for her, I\u2019m sure there are some hotels nearby.", "NTA, but why are you inviting more people than you can comfortably accommodate?\n\nAnd why not you and your buddy share and gf take the couch?", "NTA now you know your place in the hierarchy.", "Whoever 'booked' in first gets the bedroom and the other guest the couch", "Well that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, our couch is pretty big and comfortable plus us have an air mattress so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m making this girl sleep on the floor.", "Op said that while his bed is a king, the guest bed is a twin, so if they do sleep with those arrangements, someone will still be on the couch. Op also said that he previously told his girlfriend he won't give up his bed as he has before to accommodate her. They also have an air mattress she can use too.", "I mean we could but it would be tight, I have a king bed in my room and our guest bedroom is a twin, so my and my friend would be sleeping sleeping pretty close together which I feel is weird and it\u2019s his first time visiting so I don\u2019t want for him to have to deal with that. I\u2019d rather him just have his own space to be comfortable in. It\u2019s not like our couch is uncomfortable and we also have an air mattress she can sleep on. My Gf is just being unreasonable, I told her when I found out they were both coming at the same time I wasn\u2019t giving up the bed to sleep on the couch but she offered it to her friend anyway so now I\u2019m even more annoyed and standing my ground.", "I saw that! You're quite right. And I saw that his gf already told her friend that she would have the king, which is bad form.", "NTA. She ignored your clearly stated intent to not give up your bed. At this point, I'd tell her you will be sleeping in your own bed, and it's her choice as to whether she sleeps with you or her friend does.", "Well seeing as you stated your feelings before hand and she still went against it I would the best compromise would be, you and your friend take your room. Your wife and her friend can take the guest bedroom, just put a twin inflatable mattress in the guest bedroom as well.", "The air mattress is good for her friend, in my opinion."]}
