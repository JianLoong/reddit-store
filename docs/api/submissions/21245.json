Their dad isn't in the picture very often (once every 6-8 months). They don't call me dad or anything but they treat me like a father figure. They gifted me a dog 2 years ago for Father's day (the fianc\u00e9 was a bit upset about that one, whoops). \n\nWell, now my fianc\u00e9 is pregnant (6 months) and we were out on the boat the other day with my buddy and my buddies wife. They were asking if I was excited about the pregnancy and having a biological kid and I said \"well, I have 2 kids now\", referring to my dog. My fianc\u00e9 just got extremely quiet and didn't say anything. But my buddies wife piped up with \"Wow, you just made yourself sound like a fucking prick\". I ask why and she goes \"you have 3 kids at home that you've taken care of for 6 years but sure, only include the flea bag your fianc\u00e9 never wanted and unborn child into the number of children you have\". I tried defending myself but ultimately the damage was done. \n\nNow, I spoke to my fianc\u00e9 about it later (because she didn't defend me on the boat, but she didn't agree with my buddies wife either) and she goes \"that did bother me, and no, I don't want to talk about it. I have a lot to process right now.\" I tried again defending myself and that's when she kind of snapped at me and said that I not only made a fool of myself but also made her and her kids look bad in the process because I claimed my dog as my child but not the actual human kids I've helped raise. She currently isn't speaking to me and I've definitely heard her crying.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI've been with my fianc\u00e9 for 6 years and she came in to the relationship with 3 kids, whom I adore. Their dad isn't in the picture very often (once every 6-8 months). They don't call me dad or anything but they treat me like a father figure. They gifted me a dog 2 years ago for Father's day (the fianc\u00e9 was a bit upset about that one, whoops). \n\nWell, now my fianc\u00e9 is pregnant (6 months) and we were out on the boat the other day with my buddy and my buddies wife. They were asking if I was excited about the pregnancy and finally having a kid and I said \"well, I have 2 kids now\", referring to my dog. My fianc\u00e9 just got extremely quiet and didn't say anything. But my buddies wife piped up with \"Wow, you just made yourself sound like a fucking prick\". I ask why and she goes \"you have 3 kids at home that you've taken care of for 6 years but sure, only include the flea bag your fianc\u00e9 never wanted and unborn child into the number of children you have\". I tried defending myself but ultimately the damage was done. \n\nNow, I spoke to my fianc\u00e9 about it later (because she didn't defend me on the boat, but she didn't agree with my buddies wife either) and she goes \"that did bother me, and no, I don't want to talk about it. I have a lot to process right now.\" I tried again defending myself and that's when she kind of snapped at me and said that I not only made a fool of myself but also made her and her kids look bad in the process because I claimed my dog as my child but not the actual human kids I've helped raise. She currently isn't speaking to me and I've definitely heard her crying. Am I really wrong or is this weird women hormones?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
