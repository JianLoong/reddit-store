Oh and also we'll pick up takeout and have a picnic in a park instead of eating at the restaurant. \n\nDo you see how what ended up there is nothing at all like what you suggested? That's what you did. She suggested a long weekend in Sweden, where presumably she'd fly out from her airport and you'd leave for yours.

She reluctantly agrees, but now instead of a chill weekend, you want Disneyland. (I love Disneyland, but it is not chill.)
