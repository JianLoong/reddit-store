Get out now. I don't get how you can come back from \"hate raising kids with me\".", "Absolutely 100% NTA\n\nI\u2019m a teacher and I\u2019ve worked closely with educational psychologists, and I have almost 20 years experience working with under 5\u2019s. Just for background where my comment is coming from. \n\nI would ask your bf, who does it hurt if your child takes a toy to bed and who does it benefit? We all want our children to be happy. Does taking this toy to bed make your child happy? Who does it harm? This is not a habit forming activity. For example, how many 30 yo\u2019s still take a toy to bed? And even if they did, who does it harm? No one. \n\nSecondly, you didn\u2019t undermine your bf, he undermined you. You\u2019d already said the kid could have it, so he has it. Bf can\u2019t come along and remove that. \n\nFinally, you have got to be on the same page with parenting. The kids won\u2019t know if they\u2019re coming or going if you don\u2019t agree on rules for your children. My husband was also raised in a strict household but because of my experience he refers to me for what\u2019s allowed and what isn\u2019t. He understands his view of parenting is skewed because his parents didn\u2019t raise him in a loving, nurturing home. Your bf needs to know that he can still love his parents and disagree with their parenting style. \n\nBut please, sit down and hash out some rules you both agree on for your kids. Kids need stability and consistency. It\u2019s the healthy foundation to raise kids.", "NTA - but I don't know how you can ever recover from being called an \"evil monster\".", "Woah, your boyfriend seems really manipulative and controlling here, what he is doing is abusive af. Why are you even with him? This relationship does not sound healthy at all. Seriously, you really should take your child to your parents where you both are safe, from there you can take him to court for child support.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: a word.", "NTA - he says you are undermining his parenting values at the same time as telling your child he can\u2019t have the toy you told him he could have ?            \nUndermining parenting values is only ok for him ?            \nHe will not change.         \nHe will make sure your child has no fun in life.            \nLike you said no childhood.", "NTA, he\u2019s the one underminin *your* parenting, since you already told the kid that he could have the toy with him. \n\nThe \u201cyou\u2019re an evil monster and I hate having kids with you\u201d is a gigantic red flag. Be careful, and maybe ponder over the question if you really want to raise a kid with *him.*", "ESH. Your boyfriend obviously has some issues he needs to work through\u2014issues that should have put a pause on having kids until they were resolved.\n\nYou didn\u2019t need to make this about his childhood or family at all, just the childhood you want for your son.\n\nYou both hit below the belt and that\u2019s a much more concerning habit for your son to form whether he sleeps with his toy or not.", "ESH\n\nYou really should have spoken about your fundamental beliefs about child rearing before you had any children. \n\nThis does need to be hashed out - quickly. He also needs to relax a little, and not be so over baring.", "ESH. It seems like you guys need to work on communication. You delivered a low blow for something really small and his response seems way out of proportion (and something that severely undermines your relationship?)", "ESH. Letting a 3 year old sleep with a toy isn\u2019t a big deal imo and if you already told him he could no need for your bf to make a scene out of it. However, it seems like you\u2019ve had this thought about how his childhood upbringing is affecting his parenting, and that\u2019s not something you just drop in during an argument over something that doesn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal. If you haven\u2019t liked how his upbringing is affecting his parenting it seems like you should\u2019ve tried to have a mature conversation about this at some point before.", "NTA.  \n\nAdults usually prefer to sleep with someone.  \n\nWhy do people wonder why kids don\u2019t also prefer to sleep with someone?   Kids arguably need more comfort than adults.  \n\nThe toy is a replacement for human company.   Lots of adults sleep with cuddly toys for this reason.  \n\n(Not talking about sex toys - talking about regular cuddly toys, teddy bears, etc).  \n\nNTA.", "ESH\n\nUnless you have actual stories of his parents robbing him of a childhood, and not just being strict (even though it's in a slightly weird way, many parents don't let young children sleep with toys because if the danger of suffocation, which would be even higher if this was a soft toy, but that wasn't specified in your story) then you went too far. Also, he is not robbing your son of good childhood with this one decision, but I'm guessing there is so much more to this. \n\nYou went totally nuclear over something tiny. So did he. Strict does not mean unloving, cold, or abusive. Nor does it mean that your husband had no childhood. You went right to insulting his entire family and childhood over a *toy*. That's too far, and over such an unimportant issue that could, and should, have been discussed later. \n\nHe went nuclear right back with accusations of you being a monster he hates raising kids with. Again.... you guys did this over a *toy*.\n\nIf you truly believe that your husband was abused and robbed of a childhood, you need to get him into therapy. Or at least couples counseling to discuss your different parenting styles (which should have been discussed before the pregnancy, or during it) \n\nBut when you go to counseling with him, be prepared, they may have some hard news for him about his parents, but they'll also have some for you about yours. Neither of you is going to hear that you had perfect parents and your parents are the ones to emulate while ignoring the way the other was raised.", "YTA.  For not having the discussion about raising children before you had one.  Different cultures have different practices\n  Attacking the way, the man you love, was raised is the same as attacking him as a person.  Some couples therapy can teach you about Fair Fighting.  What you did was hit below the belt. Most people have different parenting styles, some better then others.  However, you need couples counseling before this leads to separation....then you have no say about parenting in his separate home.  Choose your battles.", "YTA.  You escalated first.  You two have some serious parenting style discrepancies to work through; do you think your approach -- stating his upbringing doesn't count as a childhood -- is going to help you two come to an agreed-upon solution, or hinder that process?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's emotional abuse towards you simply because he didn't get his own way.  \n\nYour BF needs some help or some therapy.

Okay, then I have a question for you:\n\nare you expecting your son to always be kind in arguments? do you think your son will never say \"I hate you\" or \"you're mean\" when arguing with your boyfriend. are you expecting your son to behave like a fully grown human with fully developed maturity from the moment he hops out the womb?\n\nno?\n\nthen what happens when your son pisses your boyfriend off? Will boyfriend call him an evil monster? how does your son being called an evil monster make you feel?\n\nalso ask yourself this: why are you putting the onus on yourself to be mature in the argument, but not your boyfriend? why is your immaturity your fault, and his immaturity your fault as well? why is it all your fault?", "Yeah bad communication at the end of a high stress day. I'll definitely apologize about that comment", "It can be really hard to make time to sit and calmly talk with each other with the daily stress of life, work, and a small child.\n\nCounseling is a great safe space to openly discuss things.\n\nAnother thing to remember is who you are arguing with (though this sounds weird) \n\nYour disagreement is with him- not his parents, but the stories from his past, and not anyone from your past who has hurt you. \n\nHis disagreement is with you- not your parents, not his parents, and not his past or anyone who hurt him before. \n\n(A great example my husband and I were given years ago was a couple who were arguing, the husband went out late after work with friends and the wife called him multiple times asking where he was and when he's get home, even though he gave a clear an answer as he could the first time- they fight when he gets home *but* the wife's father had a habit of promising to be home and not coming home, leaving and not telling anyone where he was or where he was going and being gone for days, frequently leaving her as a child very much devastated and hurt.  The husband's mother was a helicopter mom, constantly asking where he was and what he was doing and needing every single second of information about every day, and Good help him if he deviated from what she wanted him to do it where he told her he'd be, and she did that to his whole family. \n\nSo the wife wasn't arguing with her husband, she was arguing with the memory of a father who hurt her with lies and leaving and never being reliable. Her husband had nothing to do with her fear or her calls. The husband wasn't arguing with his wife, but with the memory of his over controlling, nagging mother. His wife's terrified reaction to him being out late just triggered his frustration and anger. \n\nBut once they realized this (in counseling) it was easier to say \"you are not my dad and I trust you to come home and know you aren't doing anything wrong and I'll try to overcome that fear, forgive me when I can't while I'm working on this\" and \"you are not my mom, you are not trying to control my actions, you just want to know what to expect from me, and occasionally struggle with fear that you'll get hurt again, forgive me as I also struggle with my frustration response to this and know that I'm trying\" and to treasure each other in ways that recognized what was actually being addressed. \n\nKnowing who you are arguing with is step one to healthy arguing. \nStep two is being clear about why things hurt you, down to the details in your past that cause it (if you know them) \nAnd there were a lot of other steps, but those are burned into my brain because they helped so much.", "Yeah we both need stronger communication skills and need to learn to hold our tongue until we can have a mature conversation. The explosive arguments will have a much bigger affect on our son development compared to whether or not he can sleep with his toy. I can see that so clearly now. I'm really happy I posted on here. Thanks for the perspective!", "I definitely agree he has ALOT of underlying trauma from his past he needs to resolve. He is very explosive when he gets triggered and it does worry me. He's the kind of person that sees red. I'm gonna try to talk to him about going to counseling. I do love him and want to make our family work. How do you know when it's time to give up? Once things get physical?", "To clarify when I told my son he could have the toy, bf didn't hear me say that. And then he he took it I piped up saying I already said he could. Then we had the argument because he felt I was undermining his authority in front of our son. At the point I was already pissed because poor guy crying for his toy so I snapped and told him just because he didn't have a childhood doesn't mean he can take our sons away. Which was a low blow. I feel like I blind sided him kind of\nEdit: I do agree he needs therapy forsure", "Wow amazing!!! That makes so much sense! I've never thought about it in that light.

Good luck!", "Where do you want to draw the line? Where do you think your child wants the line?\n\nThink of all the other forms of abuse he could implement before he hits you? He could financially ruin you so that you have no means to get out. He could isolate you from your entire social and extended family network so you have no one to turn to.
