It still wasn\u2019t enough. If your stepdaughter is serious about being in the medical field, there are other careers she can pursue, like nursing, radiology, etc, but she\u2019s going to need to shape up her math and science grades. Sadly, I think her ship has already sailed for medical school unless she completely starts from scratch. \n\nThat said, maybe your approach was a little too tough love for her taste. Try having a conversation with her again that involves more questions like \u201cWhat are the requirements to get into [insert school ex John Hopkins]?\u201d, \u201cWhat is your plan to meet those requirements?\u201d, etc. Either she\u2019ll connect the dots and figure out how to get there, move on to something else that doesn\u2019t require a basically flawless GPA, or she will have to learn the hard way.", "NTA Being a doctor is all about the science and processing cold facts and logic at the highest level.

I learnt a lot about studying in my bachelors and I realised that the traditional methods didn\u2019t work for me. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think your concerns aren\u2019t valid. \n\nIn Australia they look at pretty much any undergrad degree for entry into med as long as the gpa is good. I think if that is the case where you are from, you should encourage her to do an undergrad degree where she has the potential to go into a job following it, but could also pursue med after if she wants to.

He\u2019s the first doctor in the family, so my buddy had no idea what to expect. He said it was very telling that when his son got his undergrad degree, the school (a large and prestigious university) held a small reception for everyone that was going on to med school. There were only about 25 students and their families at the reception. The son told my buddy that hundreds of undergraduates had applied to med school from his graduating class. \n\nI know this is anecdotal, but the point is your daughter is going to apply to a bunch of med schools and not get accepted based on her grades.

There is not a single medical school that will accept her with that history.", "NTA, though I\u2019ll grant you could have been more tactful. I\u2019m not a medic but my other half is; from her experience of getting into medical school, your wife is partially right that they look at things other than grades (volunteering is looked on favourably) - but they do this to differentiate between the large number of applicants they receive who meet or exceed the academic requirements. The academic requirements are essentially the minimum required to even be considered - and with good reason: there\u2019s a major step-change in difficulty between medicine and the preceding qualifications.", "YTA- she can still keep this as her major and go a different route for post-undergrad if she doesn\u2019t get in to med school.

Have her involved with tutoring in her problem areas. Have your wife/stepdaughter pay for the tutoring.

This way you can be supportive without throwing your money in the trash.", "With her current grades, she\u2019s likely going to need to get her masters before going to med school (at least that\u2019s the direction the med school advisor pushed in my university). So you\u2019re looking at added expenses there. By her junior year, she should be meeting with the med school advisor regularly and should be hearing this from them. That\u2019s the place I\u2019d start and see how those meetings are going. A lot of people are worried about her MCAT scores, but I\u2019ve taught MCAT prep courses and it\u2019s all about how to take a test, not necessarily the information for the most part, but she should already be prepping for that as well. It sounds like she has a dream but isn\u2019t really following the right path to get there if these things aren\u2019t being done, and if you\u2019re going to keep backing her up on these things, be prepared to shell out an extra $50,000 for grad school before med school.

It's not your intention to crush her dreams but you are worried she will be disappointed and that will be hard for her and your mom and you. \n\nBut ultimately,  if she won't get into medical school, she needs to be prepared for a related, but different avenue.
