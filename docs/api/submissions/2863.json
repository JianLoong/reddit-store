She\u2019s a stay at home wife and we have no children of our own. She has a daughter from a previous relationship (Sarah) and we\u2019ve gotten along for the most part. Sarah is a junior in college and pursuing a biology degree with additional courses required by medical schools. She\u2019s had dream of being a doctor and helping people since her mom and I met. The problem is she\u2019s not a very good student. \n\nShe\u2019s failed her biology 1 class and had to retake it to get a B. She really struggled in her next level biology class and finished with a C. She also got a C in her chemistry class. She got a B in calculus 1 and 2. She\u2019s making A\u2019s in her none science and none math classes so they\u2019re padding her GPA which is at a 3.2. This semester I just learned she will make B\u2019s and C\u2019s in her science and math classes. I\u2019m not a doctor and I don\u2019t know any doctors but I did online research. I found out that medical schools require many things but at the top of the list they is a high GPA and top grades in science and math classes. With Sarah\u2019s grades, she\u2019s not getting into any medical school. I even looked into nursing school to see if I can talk her into going that route and all the ones I looked at require higher grades than what she has.\n\nI talked with my wife about it and she said medical school looks at other things besides grades and that\u2019s where Sarah excels. She has a solid volunteer resume and she\u2019s cares about people. I argued none of that matters if her grades are not good enough. She argues that Sarah will do great in the interviews. Like I said, I have no experience with medical school so I can\u2019t argue with her logic. Instead, I talked with Sarah when she came home for thanksgiving and told her to look into another major because she might not be cut out to be a doctor. She ran to her mom and we all got into a huge argument. I admit I lost my temper and yelled I\u2019m not wasting any more money on something she\u2019ll fail at. I told them both I\u2019m not paying for next semester\u2019s classes unless she changes her major to something more realistic.\n\nI feel bad, I really do but I\u2019m not rich and I don\u2019t have money to waste if she doesn\u2019t have a chance to get into medical school.\n\nAITA?\n\nAdditional info: the reason why I want her to switch majors is that having a biology degree without any advanced degree is useless from my research. While I don\u2019t know any doctors, I have friends who have biology degrees without other advanced degrees and they couldn\u2019t do anything with it. One had to go back to school for another degree, one works as an assistant manager at Lowe\u2019s, another has been a receptionist for 20 years. They all advised against getting just a biology degree. While these are all noble jobs, they didn\u2019t need to pay for a biology degree to get those jobs.\n\nI\u2019m still willing to pay for her degree if she switches to something that will allow her to get a good job.", "created_utc": 1669031285, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0x0ob/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_stepdaughters_tuition/", "score": 6533, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve known people with nearly perfect GPAs who didn\u2019t get into medical school and they worked themselves to the bone trying to get in. One guy, in particular, was involved in some pretty impressive extracurriculars, had good MCAT scores and around a 3.85 GPA (it was the non-math and science classes that brought him down). It still wasn\u2019t enough. If your stepdaughter is serious about being in the medical field, there are other careers she can pursue, like nursing, radiology, etc, but she\u2019s going to need to shape up her math and science grades. Sadly, I think her ship has already sailed for medical school unless she completely starts from scratch. \n\nThat said, maybe your approach was a little too tough love for her taste. Try having a conversation with her again that involves more questions like \u201cWhat are the requirements to get into [insert school ex John Hopkins]?\u201d, \u201cWhat is your plan to meet those requirements?\u201d, etc. Either she\u2019ll connect the dots and figure out how to get there, move on to something else that doesn\u2019t require a basically flawless GPA, or she will have to learn the hard way.", "NTA Being a doctor is all about the science and processing cold facts and logic at the highest level.

Having a career and plan in mind is great, but graduating with a decent GPA and a combination of volunteer and work experience in the sciences may get her a lot more stability than a 4.0 gpa in Ancient Greek history (nothing against the folks who make their careers in humanities, just giving an example).  \n\nA lot of people recommended having her talk with her advisor, but I would also have her talk to the career development folks and anyone in the alumnae network.

Mom thinks the interview process will save her daughter, but med schools won\u2019t read the application if the GPA and MCAT score are not at their threshold. She needs to understand that.

Without a PhD or MD it's really hard to have a full career with reasonable pay in biological sciences - hell even a master's degree isn't enough for a lot of people, especially if they were mediocre students. There is just too much competition and too little money in the field. Even very talented and studious friends of mine who finished their biology degrees but decided med school wasn't their path got jobs making 40-50k as a research assistant in a HCOL area at a prestigious facility. Plus there is little to no possibility for advancement without getting higher degrees - most people worked there for 1-2 years as \"gap years\" before continuing in higher ed. And that is basically the best possible scenario for having just a BS in biology or closely related field.\n\nAs a contrast even the lowest paid CS students I knew made 80k+ coming out of college with tons of room for advancement since most people that don't have visa concerns don't get higher degrees. I know I'll likely never be a \"big name\" in the field or start my own company, but I can live a thoroughly comfortable life and support a family without doing that. In biology you basically either have to switch fields or get a higher degree to have a chance at that. It sucks the ROI works out like that, but it is the reality. I can fully believe that OP was able to query a bunch of people with a BS in biology and most of them recommended against it, since even 5 years out of my program literally every one of my friends in a similar position with the benefit of hindsight says the same thing.

My cousin (6 months younger than me) was never really academically inclined (even in primary school). When we were 17, she decided to do a technical degree in nursing (the way school works here is 6 years of grade school, 5 years of high school and then you can do a technical degree in what amounts to college (not university) for 2 years and then either work with that degree (which in this case would have been very basic nursing work) or go on to university to pursue a BA or Masters or whatnot). This was very surprising to us all as she simply didn't have the grades to get into this still very limited space program reserved for those with the best grades. So it took her 2 years to get into the program (she was then 19, I was staring my first government job after having pursued a technical degree for 3 years), then she was in there for 6 years (she had failed twice before finally barely passing her degree) at which point she graduated at 25 years old (by then I had bought my first property and was rising through the ranks of my organization and starting my family). I remember picking her up from her parent's place (where she still lived) and asking if she was going to try getting a job in a hospital or clinic and start looking at moving out and establish her adult life and she was all, no, I'm gonna go for a nurse practitioner university degree and my dad is gonna pay for it because he makes a good salary, he should provide for me. \n\nI had a talk with my aunt after that and we were flabbergasted by what she was planning and my aunt actually was desperate for her to stop going down that road as it was looking more and more like she was making it a professional career to just go to school. A year later, her dad cut her off and said enough, you can pay your own way through school now (but he was kind and let her stay in her childhood room with a small rent). She was in university for another 10 years trying to get that damn degree......10 YEARS! She graduated last year (again, bottom of her class, barely passed), she still lives at home but she's found a job in a hospital and makes a decent salary so I'm happy for her but my aunt is just so desperate for her to find her own place and her own way at this point and she's not showing any interest in getting herself an apartment at this point. Meanwhile I've been working a government job since I was 19 (16 years), I'm in middle management, make a great salary, had my own place (renting first, then owning) since I was 18 and I just could not comprehend why she would take so long to launch and remain in an environment where she wasn't excelling let alone passing for so long!\n\nThis probably sounds like a personal pat on the shoulder and that I think myself better than she is, but I'm not. She's a great person, she can be very efficient, and I think that she would have been amazing in a job like the one I started with and would have seamlessly rose through the ranks as I did and find herself in the same place as I am today. It baffles me that she would spend so much time trying to do something she's just not good at (and personally, I would not be happy to be treated by a nurse practitioner who spent 6 years trying to pass a two year basic nursing degree and 10 years on a nurse practitioner's degree that should have been done within 6 years and then barely passed the minimum requirements to be certified). \n\nShe's now 35 years old and basically starting her adult life and she's not equipped to live on her own......she's never had to maintain a house, pay bills, do anything to sustain herself, her parents have been managing her life since day one! \n\nIt blows my mind!", "NTA - You are being responsible and realistic here.

Even when I dropped out, they never doubted for a second that I would succeed. People meet the expectations given to them more often than not\n\n1) You are the asshole for expecting her to fail. The fact that her internal voice of doubt will probably sound like you for the rest of her life should be horrifying for you\n\n2) You are the asshole for giving her an ultimatum. I was a failing student that was aimed at grad school. The student's that aren't making the cut know it. They have conversations about alternatives. As graduation creeps closer, these conversations become longer and louder. You don't need to worry for her. She knows, and she worries enough. This ultimatum is a bid for control to ease your anxiety at the cost of your relationship with her\n\n3) You're the asshole for pulling support (on an ultimatum) mid year in November. Deciding not to fund her school is fine, but doing something like this when she can't apply for public loans or aid is horrible. Pulling aid on an ultimatum alone is bad, but the timing makes it so much worse. Letting her pass the deadlines for getting self funding and then pulling your support is like yelling \"got it\" in volleyball and then not getting it. This is incredibly out of line\n\n4) A supportive and loving parent could bring up these concerns in good faith but you need to lead with support and approach with an honest conversation. You may have ruined any chance at having those conversations with her by pulling this ultimatum. Every concern you have will sound like an expectation of failure now.\n\nSo a good solution to ease your anxiety and not destroy your relationship with your family:\n\n1) Fund college through this year because she made important choices based off your promise. Tell her you won't fund college anymore starting next year. No ultimatum. Make your choice to fund or not, then do it\n\n2) Support her efforts. It's not wrong to make her aware of the risks, but help her prepare for the risks instead of assuming failure. Best case scenario if you continue down this road is that she transfers and every time she thinks about her broken dream she blames you. Worst case if you support her is that she doesn't achieve her dream but she remembers the support you provided. The worst case if you support her is better than the best case if you don't\n\n3) If you feel like you need to control her life because you are spending a lot of money - stop spending money.

It sounds like she is already pretty open with you and her mom about grades and her aspirations. Losing trust and communication will make everything much, much harder for all involved.

You legally don\u2019t get much (any) info about your daughter\u2019s academics because of FERPA, but having a meeting together can help make things clear for everyone. Go into the meeting with questions in mind.

Types of careers with biology major, salary of such careers, med school requirements, the kind of career your daughter wants (broaden it- service/helping people vs some specific type of doctor). Nursing is an excellent profession and there are accelerated programs she can join after Bachelor\u2019s if there\u2019s isn\u2019t a viable option to get things going earlier. Have your daughter pick at these during fall break and write down her thoughts and findings. Reconvene as a family and talk again before fall break ends, then bring this with the meeting to the academic advisor and encourage your daughter lead the conversation with the advisor. Your daughter should take notes during the meeting. I\u2019d suggest that your daughter set up another meeting before the semester ends with her advisors too.\n\nI could go on and on and on.

How would that leave her in a different situation? Do you want to suggest she consider social work? That\u2019s a solid option for medically minded people who excel in the humanities. \n\nI stand by it being okay to not have wanted to pay for a degree at all but the conditions you have in her degree of choice are a little ridiculous.

We didn\u2019t have any realistic information of how the real of a doctor/medical professional would be back then. Everybody just thought of being a doctor meaning good salary, respect from people and saving lives. I was in a school for gifted students and we had to train 10-14 hours a day on just 3 major subjects (Maths, Bio, Chem) for 3 years straight to do a specific entrance test to get in medical schools. Each subject was scored out of 10, so if you don\u2019t get 28.5-29/30, don\u2019t even think about medical schools. And that\u2019s me. I got around 27/30 during me 3 final mock tests so I decided to switch my major. My friends who got into the medical school, 4 of them quit the medical school after the first year because of how intense it was with just the amount of knowledge and the fear of possibility to kill someone if they made one medical mistake. \nSo I think if OP\u2019s daughter is struggling with pre-med school subjects like that, she would not make it and ended up wasting more money, time and loosing her own confidence and hope.", "Yeah but i would only care what grades they got in med school. Intro to chemistry doesn\u2019t really matter that much to being a doctor. Of course you have to understand that taking meds will alter your blood chemistry but you don\u2019t really need to calculate actual medical equations.", ">microbio\n\nshe's also not going to be a nurse without that", "Me too! C+ in gen chem and A- in ochem", "There absolutely are tons of really good science jobs out there but general biology is way less flexible than biochem, cellular molecular biology, ecology, bioengineering, genetics, immunology, chemistry, or physics majors in terms of landing those jobs. In many ways, general biology has the least rigorous requirements in comparison to these other sub fields of biology/science. Again, YMMV depending on your school.", "But it\u2019s not just intro to chem that she\u2019s struggling with. OP said all her STEM courses have poor grades, and that all her non-STEM courses are what\u2019s bringing her GPA up. If you\u2019re struggling in *all* the STEM courses you take, there\u2019s an *extremely high* chance you\u2019re really going to struggle in medicine.", "> Of course you have to understand that taking meds will alter your blood chemistry but you don\u2019t really need to calculate actual medical equations.\n\nUnless she magically understands organic chemistry at a much better rate, she's gonna struggle with all of biochem and pharmacy in medical school. And that's a pretty big component of pre-clinical years. You don't need to know actual chemical reactions but there's still a decent amount of retention that has to happen with that subject matter.", "As opposed to tripling it for an engineering degree she doesn\u2019t want either.", "I got a 4 year degree in 3 years\u2026 many of my friends did also. If you got into a good school chances are you have over a year of general credits from AP/IB exams. Just your required GE and degree classes usually are 2.5 to 3 years. There\u2019s a lot of room in there for extras. In fact, I graduated in 3 years and took 1 year of Russian language that I did not need for any reason. I just wanted to.", "My best friend did it. Went to Granada, now is 2 years away from finishing his residency to be an ER doctor. He went through it to get there though, no doubt.", "I don't have a stem background, but from what I understand, Weighted grades are pretty common in math, science and engineering courses because the depth of knowledge/difficulty may not be realistic for undergrads to master, and it can be difficult to write test questions that are the same level of difficulty consistently, so weighing grades help balance out the harder than average tests to the easier than average tests, keeping with the assumption that average student skill remains consistent year after year.\n\nThat being said, in education there's also a concept called the washback effect.  The way you evaluate/test students influences both instruction and the way students learn.  So if everyone knows they don't just have to learn the material, they have to learn it better than their classmates to get a good grade, this incentivizes more study and overall better perfomance.", "Doing poorly at any college level class doesn't bode well for med school though. It's not just higher level concepts. It's the pace. You have to learn an insane amount in an even shorter amount of time and it's not nearly as easy as college where you maybe take 20-25 hours of classes per week. To do well in med school, you have to be putting in full work week type hours, if not more.", "It's absolutely maddening. It just highlights how backwards the values in our society are. The intense pressure that paramedics are able to operate and make life saving decisions under is truly something to be in awe of. Yet we're fine paying them less than what people are trying to set the minimum wage to. The EMTs in my area make less than $10 an hour! You can go to Target and nearly double your pay. Something is so wrong here.", "On the other hand, a doctor having poor communication skills also literally kills people. Increasingly we have so many specialists that a patient may see five different doctors, all of whom are the best in their field, and die from a simple medical mistake because the doctors didn't communicate effectively with each other, the rest of the care team, or the nurses.\n\nAtul Gawande has some great books about how to avoid surgical complications, and it comes down to communicating effectively with the patient and entire surgical team.", "That was literally my thought a few years ago when one of the docs was talking to me about the stress of preparing to retake it. \u201cThank God I don\u2019t have to deal with that.\u201d I have credentials to keep up with, too, but nothing like that. I have way too much anxiety. I got stressed out just hearing him talk about it.", "American schools have what is referred to as \"well rounded\" type of education. All students take math, history, social studies, literature, chemistry etc until the last year of high school. Do schools in Ireland do that or do students select a special track to focus in? I know some countries have their students choose a track in middle school, then narrow it further in high school. I had a friend from India who complained that he took his last literature class in middle school.", "In Ireland we take all subjects to the last year of secondary school (high school)\n\nI don't know if it's changed since but it used to be that you could earn a maximum of 600 points in the final exam (leaving certificate) to enter for college/uni, 100 points per subject, your best 6 subjects, so if you took 9 subjects and got 70 in 6 and 40 in 3 your total would be 420 out of 600.\n\nCourses for college/uni would require that you have a minimum of x amount of points from the leaving certificate as well as a minimum grade in certain subjects (almost always English, Irish and maths plus another language and then something relevant to the degree) so even if you got 600 points but failed maths you wouldn't be eligible for the course.", "Bs and Cs as a science major is not good", "I'm a chemist, and I also enjoyed my organic chemistry courses. So much so that I took additional courses in it. I put more time into it than any of my other courses and never really \"struggled\", but I went into it feeling like the information was going to be valuable to me throughout my career. That's largely proven true.", "Exactly. Those \"extras\" and interviewing well don't mean jack if you don't have the grades. Yes, they take those things into account but the assumption is that the student has top grades in the core courses necessary for their major. Because everyone else applying for those often limited spots definitely will be giving their all as well. They're not giving spots to C students just because they seem personable and have done some volunteer work when 10 kids with better grades- who have also done plenty of volunteering, extracurricular activities and have great attitudes- are applying for 6 spots.", ">Organic is a lightbulb class.\n\nThis is the damn truth. I got a C in Org Chem. It took me until the end of the semester to get the \"AHA!\" moment. I struggle bussed through it. I think the problem for me is I can't visualize things, which made pushing electrons super hard. \n\nThen again, at the college I went to, 35% was a D, and each class had a couple hundred students in it. So not a lot of help either.", "That\u2019s interesting. I couldn\u2019t stand general chemistry, but I really liked the real life applications of chemistry and I have very strong spacial reasoning skills. Maybe I actually would have done better in organic chemistry. I guess I\u2019ll never know."]}
