She\u2019s a stay at home wife and we have no children of our own. She has a daughter from a previous relationship (Sarah) and we\u2019ve gotten along for the most part. Sarah is a junior in college and pursuing a biology degree with additional courses required by medical schools. She\u2019s had dream of being a doctor and helping people since her mom and I met. The problem is she\u2019s not a very good student. \n\nShe\u2019s failed her biology 1 class and had to retake it to get a B. She really struggled in her next level biology class and finished with a C. She also got a C in her chemistry class. She got a B in calculus 1 and 2. She\u2019s making A\u2019s in her none science and none math classes so they\u2019re padding her GPA which is at a 3.2. This semester I just learned she will make B\u2019s and C\u2019s in her science and math classes. I\u2019m not a doctor and I don\u2019t know any doctors but I did online research. I found out that medical schools require many things but at the top of the list they is a high GPA and top grades in science and math classes. With Sarah\u2019s grades, she\u2019s not getting into any medical school. I even looked into nursing school to see if I can talk her into going that route and all the ones I looked at require higher grades than what she has.\n\nI talked with my wife about it and she said medical school looks at other things besides grades and that\u2019s where Sarah excels. She has a solid volunteer resume and she\u2019s cares about people. I argued none of that matters if her grades are not good enough. She argues that Sarah will do great in the interviews. Like I said, I have no experience with medical school so I can\u2019t argue with her logic. Instead, I talked with Sarah when she came home for thanksgiving and told her to look into another major because she might not be cut out to be a doctor. She ran to her mom and we all got into a huge argument. I admit I lost my temper and yelled I\u2019m not wasting any more money on something she\u2019ll fail at. I told them both I\u2019m not paying for next semester\u2019s classes unless she changes her major to something more realistic.\n\nI feel bad, I really do but I\u2019m not rich and I don\u2019t have money to waste if she doesn\u2019t have a chance to get into medical school.\n\nAITA?\n\nAdditional info: the reason why I want her to switch majors is that having a biology degree without any advanced degree is useless from my research. While I don\u2019t know any doctors, I have friends who have biology degrees without other advanced degrees and they couldn\u2019t do anything with it. One had to go back to school for another degree, one works as an assistant manager at Lowe\u2019s, another has been a receptionist for 20 years. They all advised against getting just a biology degree. While these are all noble jobs, they didn\u2019t need to pay for a biology degree to get those jobs.\n\nI\u2019m still willing to pay for her degree if she switches to something that will allow her to get a good job.", "created_utc": 1669031285, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0x0ob/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_stepdaughters_tuition/", "score": 1144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It still wasn\u2019t enough. If your stepdaughter is serious about being in the medical field, there are other careers she can pursue, like nursing, radiology, etc, but she\u2019s going to need to shape up her math and science grades. Sadly, I think her ship has already sailed for medical school unless she completely starts from scratch. \n\nThat said, maybe your approach was a little too tough love for her taste. Try having a conversation with her again that involves more questions like \u201cWhat are the requirements to get into [insert school ex John Hopkins]?\u201d, \u201cWhat is your plan to meet those requirements?\u201d, etc. Either she\u2019ll connect the dots and figure out how to get there, move on to something else that doesn\u2019t require a basically flawless GPA, or she will have to learn the hard way.", "NTA Being a doctor is all about the science and processing cold facts and logic at the highest level.

But this is an investment from OP so it makes sense they want to see them get a degree better suited to their skills.\n\nThat's not to say biology is a useless major on its own.

Also medical courses now are much more hyper-competitive at this point of time and tougher to get in compared to your age, no offence.", "That's comparing apples and oranges. Not basic Chem to ochem. If she struggled to pass basic Chem she won't survive o Chem", "No where does it say she's far behind and won't finish in 4 years though. He wouldn't be an ass to say that doing it full-time and finishing her degree is a condition of him paying and supporting her.\n\nAt the end of the 4 years she'll have her Bachelor's degree. What she does after is up to discussion regarding medical school but it's not wasted money in my opinion.", "This is unequivocally wrong. You can absolutely do work in research without a graduate degree.", "One of the girls I worked with when I did an internship for pharma research didn't even go to uni. She did a pharmacy technician (which tbf is a hard non-uni degree) and then worked in the NHS hospital manifacturing system. She was a brilliant scientiest, I learned so much from her.", "Nonsense. You can work in clinical research, work at a hospital, work at a biotech company on the administrative side. There is plenty you can do with a BS in biology.", "I have never once in my 20 years of working had a potential employer ask to see my college grades.", "I had a friend in college who didnt get great grades in biology or chemisty, and wanted to be a doctor - he would never get into med school in the UK so went abroad to study in Cyprus.", "Or the Caribbean.", "It's her non math and science classes that are padding her GPA to 3.2 so basically if she slips in them, she'll be probably 2. something.", "But i said that he should put a plan B as a condition of continuing to pay for college", "The nursing schools I know of are extremely competitive to get into. It\u2019s not a career that\u2019s a fallback from becoming a doctor. Even careers for someone with a biology degree might not be that good for her, since she\u2019s struggling in biology.\n\nShe\u2019s doing very well in some courses, so she should look into what careers those could lead to.", "Absolutely more difficult now than 30 years ago, still,  my office has many young and dumb working there in effort to get experience for their applications and I can tell you from experience that only 2 people failed to get into medical school. 1 did not want to go at any point and was forced on the path by her parents and the other was a party boy with a gambling addiction. There was one that didn't make it in his first year of trying, another who I thought was a list cause tried for 3 years.  Both succeeded. Both are called doctors now and I doubt if anyone knows their sordid past. Ha.  As a parent of a child in college who is getting a undergrad in bio sciences, I solved a slow start by refusing to pay for any classes that aren't a B.  OP could do the same. If his daughter wants it, she will find a way.  Even if it is in Mississippi. P.S unsure what your meant by A... somewhere?", "I\u2019m not 100% sure about biology, but if it\u2019s anything like business she is already behind and won\u2019t graduate on time. The 4 year degree being based on a full course slate for 3 semesters per year. There is no room for retakes on that schedule. \n\nOf course if she is not behind and will finish on time then it would be reasonable for OP to make your offer. I still don\u2019t think he is obligated. And let\u2019s not pretend he is shitting all over her dream, she is doing that herself.", "He was talking about her being able to pay back the loans, how much are you paid for your research jobs without a postgraduate degree. Pray tell lol", "med student here with friends at the best of those. Would not recommend. They teach themselves while admin puts spokes in their wheels and the chances of matching afterwards are sadness", "Mexico might be an option.", "Yeah, if your college makes it able to pad out your GPA to 3.2 with classes that are not part of your major's core requirements than its probably a fake college.  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "I can definitely understand your perspective. If she fails only one class and she finishes one semester later to finish one last class she pays for, I don't think that's a huge issue. I never did biology but she would simply get her diploma like 3-4 months later right? No big deal in the grand scheme of things.\n\nNow if she was constantly failing? Big difference. Then you can say this major is not suited to her strengths. But that's not truly what's happening though, she does seem to be passing. :)", "I managed to finish my biology degree in three years without skipping any major classes or taking more than the recommended amount of STEM courses, so there's definitely wiggle room. Only the first two years have sequential classes for the most part (bio 1/2, chem 1/2, ochem 1/2). The rest will mostly be major elective courses. She can always do summer courses.", "Seconded. Caribbean schools have an atrocious residency match rate, even for the \"easiest\" of specialties. You have to really work your ass off to succeed in those programs and from what I've heard, they can be ruthless if you fall behind.", "My family came to the US from another country in the 60s and didn\u2019t speak English or understand the value of education. My aunt wasn\u2019t the best student, but wanted to be a doctor. She went to the Dominic Republic in the 80s for med school and has been a pediatrician in the US for years. It wasn\u2019t easy for her, but if there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way.", "If there is a will there is a way.  If stepdad does not want to pay, if she has the will she will find a way.  Most doctors graduate with over $300,000 in educational debt.  If she wants it that bad, she can put herself in debt.  I would not pay for a mediocre student to go to medical school."]}
