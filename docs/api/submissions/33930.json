Never feel guilty for doing what is best for babe!", "NTA. You will be breastfeeding a newborn. \n\nYou could still attend if you want to, with your husband taking baby duty at the hotel or in town, but you couldn't be MOH. Do the wedding, then leave. If she wants you to be the MOH, she will need to understand the baby with you as you get ready, and possibly you ducking out a few times during the reception. Even if the baby wasn't there, you would have to duck out to pump. There is only so long you can go without pumping before you get serious pain and mastitis. \n\nI get the point of kid-free weddings, but if you want brand new parents of infants to attend, there has to be some leeway given.", "NTA. Breastfeeding newborn trumps a party. Especially when they didn\u2019t give you more advance warning that they wouldn\u2019t make an exception though they presumably have known you\u2019re pregnant for a while and presumably can do basic arithmetic. Address it for your peace of mind (so that you\u2019ll know you did all you could) - and if they think their party should be more important to you than your newborn, that\u2019s all the more reason not to go.", "NTA. I would just have the conversation with her and say that you understand the no children rule, but unfortunately, you will not be able to attend since you have a baby. It's not like you're not going just because.", "At this point I'd just decline the MOH position.  Let your sister know that you may not be able to stay long at the wedding due to the babys needs - so it's best you are able to leave without messing up any wedding schedules.\n\nNAH\n\nNo need to skip the entire wedding\nYou can ask friend or husband to cover with baby nearby for ceremony", "[deleted]", "Discuss what was said to you with your sister. Let her know that due to breastfeeding and your child being a newborn, it isn\u2019t a possibility to leave your child at home.

At least at this point you will have tried.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSurely it's unreasonable to expect a woman to undertake MOH duties so soon after giving birth? How come the sister doesn't understand this? She seems a little selfish.", "NTA -- a tiny baby being breastfed is quite different from a rambunctious 7-year-old. Either your sister allows the baby to come or you skip the reception. You could go ahead with being the maid of honour and then duck out of the rest of the evening if she won't allow an infant in its mother's arms.", "NAN but you need to tell her about this as soon as possible so she can find someone to act as MOH. Don't just ghost her your relationship with her will suffer a lot from that.", "Well, if you don't want to cause upset, then you better say something sooner rather than later. As for your sister, she might tell you to keep your kid with your husband yari-yara, but she has to understand the consequences of the rules she makes. NTA.", "Omg, just talk to your sister about it. There's plenty of time to figure it out still. But yes, I think YWBTA if you didn't attend it and it seems weird that you're leaning towards that instead of having a conversation with your twin.", "NTA. Couples need to realize that if they choose to have a wedding without kids, then parents - no matter how close they might be to the bride and groom - might not come.\n\nOf course you don't want to leave your newborn! If she refuses to compromise with you on this, let go of your MOH duties, but offer to still attend, still walk down the aisle if she wants you to, but skip the getting ready portion and the reception. Babies that age feed every 2-4 hours. Tell her that's the time you have, and that you'll need to return home to your husband and baby after.", "NTA, but go ahead and \"kick up a fuss\" right now, so your sister knows that you are not attending. Your feeling that at 3 months, your baby is too young for you to be far away, is all you need to say\u2014no need to justify that. The reality is that you'd be leaking and having to pump, worried about your little one, in short, miserable. You'll get some flack for not having said something sooner, but no matter\u2014just make it clear now. In my opinion, your sister did a little end run by having her fianc\u00e9 tell you in the middle of a big family dinner, so you would have a hard time objecting. It worked, you did not speak up, but now she has to face the fact that her child free wedding means a wedding without you. Her wedding day does not come first for everyone else\u2014but your 3 month old baby does come first for you.", "NAH based on the information you've provided. I understand not wanting a baby or any other children at your wedding but a baby even more so because they have no control over when they will cry. Also you won't be able to fulfil your MOH duties if your baby is there. You can't attend to the bride while holding or having to breastfeed your baby. I can understand backing out of MOH if you're expected to leave your baby for days. If it's just a few hours I think it's reasonable to leave the baby with your husband.", "INFO: why was it your BIL who told you of this rule, and not your twin sister?\n\nThat implies already that you two don\u2019t have a great relationship. \n\nAnd probably why it was done at Christmas, because you aren\u2019t close enough to casually talk at any other time in the year. \n\nI cannot imagine someone I was close to sending their partner to break this kind of news to me.", "INFO: is the wedding fairly local? If so I would go for the ceremony (maybe hubby can drive you with baby) but definitely not as MOH. Then at least you are showing that you want to be there to see her get married. If you don\u2019t make some effort I can see her being bitter for decades. But just explain you couldn\u2019t do your MOH duties properly and wouldn\u2019t want to let her down, as well as not being able to be away from the baby. You shouldn\u2019t have to say that, but it might help lessen the bad feeling. NTA anyway.", "Talk to her first. Where I am from, kid free usually means babes in arms are allowed.

Yes it is their choice to not have any children at their wedding. Fair point. But it is also fair that you don't want to leave your 3 month old one alone for a hole day. Talk to your sister about it. Try to stay calm. Tell her you respect her wish and get it, but that you can't think about leaving your child alone. You are sorry but she might look for another MOH.

I\u2019ve been a MOH with a three month old twice.  Neither of my kids took a bottle.  It was not fun.  Trying to take a break to pump in a bridesmaid dress is super fun.  Finding dresses while you\u2019re pregnant is also  super fun.  Then finding a dress that works with breastfeeding boobs is fun.  You need to sit down and have a long talk with your sister about all this and see what you can come up with.  It would be easy if it was in a hotel where your hubby could just hang out and you could pop out to go feed the baby.  But it does not sound like this is the case.  She\u2019s gonna need to throw you a bone here if she wants you to make it to the wedding.", "Normally, I would say N A H because it is totally understandable if someone wants a childfree wedding and if parents don't want to leave their very young baby with someone else, but this one is a bit different. \n\nSo, they want a childfree wedding, you are the MOH, you are pregnant (I assume your sister knows about it?), and it was her fianc\u00e9 who talked to you, not your sister. I guess he said \"we want absolutely no children at our wedding\" to  say that your baby isn't welcome without saying your baby isn't welcome. There is a chance that your sister doesn't know that her fianc\u00e9 talked to you, but IF she knew it's a coward-move not being the one to tell you. I know I make a lot of assumptions right now, but it all seems a bit fishy. \n\nAre you a first-time mom?

It's a very common choice amongst very experienced mothers as well for any number of sensible reasons.\n\nFrankly, the fact that you would expect a mother of a newborn to opt for a more expensive, more complicated method of feeding her child (and one that the child might not even take to), just so that she could attend a party (yes, even her sibling's wedding), is shockingly arrogant as well.  And you're telling on yourself with your snarky daycare comment. Girl, this isn't about you and your insecurities about being a bad mother; stop projecting. Your weird defensiveness is visible from space it's so overblown. \n\nAnd yes, this IS about her child's needs. Because it's weird AF NOT to put a child's well-being above a party. And your whole \"this is the most important day of your sister's life\" is just as simplistic and childish as you're accusing her of being, because there's no reason she can't go to the wedding. If it's that important to the bride for her to be there, she can accommodate her sister, the new mother. Very easily. In any one of a dozen different ways.
