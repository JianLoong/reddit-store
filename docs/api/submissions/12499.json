You may love your father but he is also an AH tbh. He allowed you to grow in a toxic environment with a drug addict to the point of nightmares and blames you for making his life 'hard'.

You don't owe your bio-parents anything.\n\nI don't know your full backstory, so I won't judge - it's hard for me to reconcile someone who loves one parent but hates the other.  If the mother is abusive/addict/whatever, the father is also most likely a codependent enabler who is responsible for the mother's damage if he stays in relationship.\n\nI'd flip it on your father and say \"you made my life difficult by not rescuing me from that monster when I was too young to rescue myself.  You make my life difficult by supporting someone who is so harmful to me that I had to leave my hometown to feel safe.\"", "Nta.

They are downvoting this comment because I didn't say that.)\n\nI sometimes agree with that, and sometimes do not. It really depends on the situation.\n\nIn your situation, YWBTA if you invited your father and not your mother. It puts your dad in an awkward position because he is still married to your mother. If they were divorced, it would be fine. And it's totally understandable that you don't want your mom there. But if you invite your father and give all the details to him, she might decide to show up anyway.\n\nThis is really a party that your new husband's family is hosting for their family. And they are inviting your brother. Better to leave it at that, and don't invite either parent. Instead, involve your father by going out for a nice brunch or dinner with just your dad and new husband.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
