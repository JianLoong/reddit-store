It\u2019s always dark outside. Apparently, a lot of dickheads also drive at these times\u2026\n\nSo earlier this morning when I was on my way home, one of those American-like truck cars that are just comically big (spoiler: I don\u2019t live in America, so most cars here are small or aren\u2019t as tall as the ones over there) decided that it was a good idea to drive directly behind me instead of keeping a safe distance. His lights were so bright that I could barely see anything due to them blinding me in all three mirrors. I\u2019m not sure if he had high beams on or if it was just due to the size of his car, but either way, I don\u2019t care. He was too close and I couldn\u2019t see. So, I adjusted my rear view mirror so that it would reflect back at him. Obviously, jackass didn\u2019t like that, so he started driving even closer, though that obviously didn\u2019t help him with blinding himself. I just continued driving and adjusted the side view mirrors too.\n\nEventually, I had to stop at a red light. Idiot comes up next to me, gets out of his car and starts waving threateningly at me, acting like he\u2019s gonna take a hammer to my windows if I don\u2019t roll them down or get out. Not doing that, so I flip him the bird, turn up my music and ignore him. Right before the light turns green, he actually tries to open my passenger door, so I book it out as soon as possible. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was going to follow me home, but I was feeling paranoid as all hell, so I took a 20 min drive around before I turned home.\n\nI learned this from my mom when I was taking my lessons, so I\u2019ve done this ever since I got my own car. Everyone who\u2019s done it in the past has politely taken the hint and kept a better distance between our cars, just not this idiot.\n\nI told a friend when  I woke up earlier this afternoon. He said it was a dick move and that I should\u2019ve just accepted that his light was blinding me?? But I feel like that would\u2019ve been incredibly unsafe and besides, it\u2019s not like I brake checked him or anything, I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

Well played.", "NTA You reacted appropriately. People who do this are the WORST. All they think about is how good they can see. So they blare their high beams not giving a flip if it blinds anyone else. It\u2019s especially bad for people with astigmatism like myself. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with this road trash.", "One night I went as far as pulling over to the right letting them pass and then turning my high beams on at them.

You could have just adjusted your mirrors to not blind you and ignore the other guy.", "NTA\n\nI do the exact same thing. Their life is not worth more than yours, so if someone has to be blinded and possibly in an accident, might as well be the jackass that deserves it.", "NTA - Good choice on directing his lights back at him.  For your own safety, as soon as he got out of his vehicle, call the police, and drive to the nearest police station, or wherever they tell you to go.", "NTA\n\nThe guy was an unstable asshole.", "NTA\n\nMost cars I have owned have a switch on the rear view mirror that dims the light coming from behind.  I just leave that on all of  the time now, with LED lights being so damn bright.\n\nAlso, tailgating me just makes be drive slower.  I won't break-check, but I won't go out of my way to pass someone quicker, either.", "NTA\n\nGetting out of your vehicle is road rage. It\u2019s an extreme escalation and is dangerous. That guy was being an AH and some people are just that. AH\u2019s.", "NTA. As an American, I, too, hate those people and applaud your actions.", "I\u2019ve never even thought about aiming my mirrors back at them. Thanks for the tip!\n\nNTA", "aw. mr road rage can\u2019t drive. shocker. your friend might be overidentifying with the guy, but that still doesn\u2019t mean *you* did anything wrong. might mean your friend could use some driving lessons tho\u2026 nta.", "NTA. Sorry to hear about all this. That guy sounds like a real jerk. Tailgating is illegal and I think you handled yourself the best you could. \n\nIn these circumstances I will often pull over and force them to pass me. That is the only thing you possibly could have done differently.\n\nSide note: I have a friend \"Mary\" who got her house shot up due to a road rage incident. Turns out a guy on a motorcycle was popping wheelies and being a jerk in traffic. Her NEIGHBOR \"Chuck\" was driving another vehicle and flipped the motorcyclist the bird and yelled at him. Motorcycle guy followed Chuck home and incorrectly identified Mary's house as Chuck's house. Motorcycle nutjob returned and shot up Mary's house and vehicle. \n\nMary was so disturbed she moved to a different state.\n\nWith that in mind, I always consider any escalation I may do on the road very carefully. No telling how crazy these people are out there. People sometimes use road rage as a way to funnel anger about things they have no control over in their lives to something physical and immediate. \n\nMy plan if I have a situation like yours is to drive to a police station. Would like to see them start something there.\n\nIn sum, fuck that guy. Protect yourself. Be careful.", "Great move, i always wanted to do this myself but haven't yet", "I am insecure about driving through the pitch black darkness. I never feel like I see adequately, although I have very good vision. At any rate, you'd be mistaken if you thought I was doing anything but trying to see my way through if I was behind you.\n\nIts not my right to blind you with the glare of my headlights behind you, though. Not at all. And no way I'm following someone and getting out to threaten them because that's just too much insanity for me.\n\nDriving emotionally is just not safe driving on any of our parts. But, I don't blame you for feeling so imposed upon and changing your mirrors to deter the threat to your safety.\n\nSo, not a great outcome. But, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Absolutely NTA, I do the same thing when a car is blinding me.  Regardless that is NO excuse for actual assault.  If he did this so easily he probably does this quite often.
