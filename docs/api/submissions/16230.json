Recently, she\u2019s been out of the country. I took her cat to the vet, and now my roommate is expecting me to pay the bill.\n\nMy roommate got an internship abroad where she would need to be gone for a few months. Obviously, she has the cat, so she was in a little bit of a snag. She asked me if I would be okay taking care of him while she\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve never had any pets before, but she assured me it would be really easy. He\u2019s a calm little dude and never caused any issues before, so I agreed.\n\nThe first month went really well. Although he seemed lonely, so I kept my door open during the day and he starting coming in to hang out. But after a bit, he started acting kind of weird. He threw up a little bit in my bed, which wasn\u2019t an issue, I just cleaned it up and figured he ate too much. Then he did it again, and again. He threw up kind of a lot that week and was acting really lethargic. He\u2019s a chunky dude, but usually really playful, for this week, he just sat around and didn\u2019t chase any of his toys or anything.\n\nI tried to get call my roommate, but my texts were green (iPhone) and all my calls were going to voicemail. I was getting worried, and since I couldn't get ahold of her at all, I took him to the vet. The vet did some tests and said the cat had some stomach bacteria thing. He prescribed some antibiotics, which were kind of expensive. I didn't really have any other choice, so I paid for them, followed the instructions, and he was back to his happy self after a while.\n\nI couldn't get ahold of her for the rest of her trip. She showed up on the day she had told me she'd be back and was elated to see her cat, just all lovey-dovey and he was obviously excited too, very cute to see. She said she saw all the messages come through at once when she landed and was so sorry, she had been using \"WhatsApp\" to talk to everyone, but forgot to tell me before she lost phone coverage. I told her it was okay, just a bit stressful, I'd never dealt with a vet before, so it was a lot to learn under pressure. I laughed it off and told her she owed me one, so she made dinner and we had a good night watching tv.\n\nBut I asked her to pay me back for the vet visit and she acted like that was a weird question? She said that I had said I'd take care of him, and she never signed off on me \"spending her money for her\". It got a little heated, and I feel a bit shitty after all that. I feel a bit used is I guess how I'd describe it. I don't really want to pay for the vet bill. I make okay money, but that's not something I budgeted for, and given the situation, I don't think I was just frivolously spending money.\n\nI feel like I'm not the asshole here for not wanting to pay. I agreed to take care of him, but I didn't know that meant covering expenses as well. Should I have not taken him to the vet? I feel like something bad might've happened if he didn't get better on his own.", "created_utc": 1683039648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135o1mj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_roommates_cats/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Agreeing to take care of a pet (or a child for that matter) is agreeing to provide reasonable care and supervision. That includes getting it medical attention if needed. It isn\u2019t you taking full financial responsibility. I\u2019m also guessing your roommate didn\u2019t pay you anything for babysitting her cat to begin with, let alone enough to cover potential medical expenses.\n\nYour roommate is responsible financially for the cat, not you.

It\u2019s really that simple. \n\nThe long and short of it is, she asked you to look after the cat. You did. She was incommunicado in another country. Her cat needed a vet visit, you took him.

Did she also expect you to pay for the cat\u2019s food since you agreed to take care of him? What kind of pet owner leaves the country and doesn\u2019t give you the necessary info to keep in contact?

It\u2019s manipulative of her to act all shocked you took her cat to the vet because he was clearly ill, and that you now would like to be paid back. Really, the directive \u201cPlease take him to (nearby emergency vet clinic name) or his regular vet (regular vet name) if he shows signs of illness and I will recoup any payments when I return\u201d should have been issued by her before she left if she were a responsible pet owner.
