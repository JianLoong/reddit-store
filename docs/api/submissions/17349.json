You succeeded in your mission to remove as many objections as possible. Your skills are better than his. End of discussion. \n\nNTA, OP. Well shot sir!", "Did you go too far?\n\nNo. You we're challenged and you showed up. \n\nYou met the demand exactly. You just exceeded low expectations.\n\nBrother might have spent a little more time finding out how good you actually are before gambling his masculine self-worth on a showdown.", "So it seems.  That's awful.", "Then there's no way you emasculated him.\n\nEven the cavemen who think it's demeaning to lose to a girl recognize that a man can lose to another man without having his nuts fall off.\n\nNTA", "Agreed! My point is just that \u201cslow precise shooting\u201d isn\u2019t really what the military is about.", "Of course! But that was kinda my point. The person in the story was acting as if being in the military implied you\u2019d be able to fire single bullets very precisely, but that\u2019s not what most soldiers do.", "\n\"I think this is your cue to cut contact completely and never look back.\"\n\nWhy on Earth does all this boil down to cutting your family out of your life. That's absolutely ridiculous, he wasn't abused.\n\nMost families have periods of turmoil and strained relations. This is all normal. OP is certainly NTA, but this is a moment where they can stand up for themselves and hopefully change their families attitudes a little. Even their SiL was kinda on their side.\n\nWe're Human's, our relationships are the most complex and complicated in the animal kingdom! You don't just cut and run from your family when you butt heads.\n\nHopefully their bro will see his wrong and apologize.", "Benelli m2. But at this point, I don't know how much is actually original. Changed the firing group polished the action. Extended mag tube. Cut and polished feeder ramp. Match saver. Over sized controls. And some others. It is about as tall as me and on the heavier side.\n\nI tried ar style shotties, but I was having too many jamming issues.", "She wants to learn. I really want to become a teacher/instructor. My goal is to have the experience behind me and hopefully a few titles, get big sponsors, and run a program that teaches basic firearm safety, training, and responsibilities. (Hopefully for free) that is open to anyone who is interested.  From people who are scared of them, to people who hate them, to first-time gun owners, to people who want to get into the sport. But as of now, that is just a dream.", "I wished it was filmed as well. It would be blaming in the background and any gathering I host or when doing zoom/FaceTime calls", "You do you!", "The old Shooter McGavin.", "I went NC with my family, with the exception of my brother, nearly 15 years ago. I have never been happier and it was so good for my mental health to remove myself from the toxicity.", "I said this on a different post and it got removed for being mean.", "Yeah. I agree.", "Not everybody in a non combatant MOS is a REMF, and there are fobits with a combat MOS as well.  Depends on the person.  If they were really \"combat trained\" I would assume a combat MOS, but who knows.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Same. Or a voucher for shooting lessons.", "No, he doesn't. But he does have the mind similar to Ricky Bobby but instead of \"if you don't chew BIG RED then F you.\"\n\nIf you don't agree with me then FU", "And have everyone start calling him something like Cowboy or Ace. See mom and dad in the grocery store, someone yells out \"Hey Cowboy!\"  Op whips around with the finger guns, \"pew pew\", tips the imaginary hat to parents and sashays in the other direction.", "Because abusers don't stop abusing you when you leave. In fact, most of them ramp up the abuse to 11 when you try to leave them.", "Really glad you **feel** that way after reading a 3-4 paragraph story about a falling out OP had with his family that couldn't possibly be one-sided in some way we could never know /s. Totally horseshit to make that recommendation based on the info given.\n\n> if OP isn't allowed to join any family functions unless an apology is made\n\nNot even what the OP says.\n\n> It got to the point that my mom said I couldn't come over for Mother's Day until I apologized to my brother. When I refused, she called me an AH again and said I couldn't come back until I apologized and made it up to him.\n\n**If OP cuts contact after this exchange, it is him cutting contact, not his family.** You people are legit insane.", "Do I not sound chill? \n\n>And you saw nothing of the sort in this 200 word story.\n\nOn the contrary, I did, as did many other commenters. That's why I mentioned it. It's ok if you don't see it yourself, you can try again or work on your reading comprehension, or simply disagree respectfully.", "Oh hello! So you know my family??", "You're gonna go far kid. You got a great attitude.", "Someone acts like an asshole.\n    \n\"Probably an abuser! Don't ignore this HUGE marinara flag guise!\"\n    \nSame old panicky nonsense on this sub. This stood out because you tried to play it off like your post was something special. It isn't.", "Also red flag of \"golden child\" plus the mom's outsize reaction showing extreme irrational favoritism ... such family environments often damage their children's mental health (personality disorders, depression, etc are not uncommon) for both the golden child and the scapegoat", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "Your arguments are boiling down to \"nuh uh!\" \n\nI'm not sure what you expect out of a response from me, heh.", "Yep.\n\nThis dude is a veritable cornucopia of flags.", "Maybe critically reviewing what made you scream \"abuse\" out of a very short and indirect description by a third party who is clearly biased. But I guess that is too much to ask.", "Yes, my sore vocal cords appreciate your concern after screaming so much. \n\nI never claimed abuse. I simply said it's at least worth exploring. Work on that reading comprehension; you'll get there!", "Straight up, or do you offer a drink of choice to go with?"]}
