I do not believe someone who loses a competition which began with some tension and animosity has a right to not be spanked and have the football spiked on them, especially after they bring an unwarranted amount of hype. I do not believe your parents and other members of the family have a right to have their \"golden child\" (and I think you called it) win every time.
