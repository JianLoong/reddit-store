If you aren't welcome back to the house, maybe this is a nice peaceful period for you.", "It\u2019s interesting because from everything I\u2019ve heard, boot camp actually has relatively little shooting", "NTA. \n\nOut of interest but what nation and military did he join and do you know what their ethos is. Currently in the navy and ours is C2DRIL\nCommitment, Courage, Determination, Respect, Integrity, Loyalty, \n\nIf it\u2019s anything similar to that your brother isn\u2019t showing any integrity, respect or Courage which is what I would assume would be basic stuff in any military mindset for all soldiers, airmen and sailors. This guy has a massive ego which you have bruised. And I will say now military experience doesn\u2019t massively transfer over with rifle drill to competition drill they are too different in methods of shooting.", "NTA\n\nWow, your family sounds awful. If mom is telling you not to come over, dont. They owe you an apology as well. You do not need this toxicity in your life.", "NTA\n\nYou called him out after all his smack talk, beat him fair and square and he threw his toys out the pram. \n\nI bet it felt good ;)", "NTA maybe the wife is more skilled than him too and was happy someone put him in his place.", "NTA, out of curiosity, what *exactly* would your mother have you say when you apologize?  Because once you give it one iota of thought, it's clear that you a) have nothing to apologize for, which is obvious, and b) would only emasculate him further by doing so, because you'd be apologizing for... reality?  She seems to be on \"his feelings were hurt so you just have done something wrong\" without giving it more thought.", "NTA.  Retired military veteran here with two combat tours.  I've run across plenty of guys like that through my time in.  They're usually the ones who sat at a desk in the rear counting mess kits.  Not that their job was unimportant or useless.  It takes 40,000 to enable 10,000 to fight.  The grunts couldn't do their job without the ones in support.  That being said it sounds to me like your brother was trying to embarrass you in order to validate himself.  Honestly, I have a hard time believing he was in the service; in the military you have to develop a thick skin when people pick on you, otherwise they'll eat you alive.", "Haha he got what he deserved", "It's always satisfying when the trash takes itself out like that.", "I grew up in a family where my older brother was the \u201cgolden child\u201d. Trust me when I say cutting contact is amazing for your mental health.", "Why are people here so quick to say \"cut contact forever\"?  That's his brother.  They need to work on their relationship but cutting contact and never looking back seems a bit over the top.  Maybe they can work this out.  He only has one family.  If he cuts contact with his brother he might lose his parents as well.  Some people love their families even if they have issues like this with them.  \n\nIt's just such an over the top reaction.  Yeah OP's brother is an asshole but he's still family.  Maybe they can work it out?", "An adult responding like that sure has some issues. We had a bit of showoff last Christmas at my wife's grandparents. Everybody was talking about salaries, everybody praising my wife's cousin having doing so well and getting a big salary and naturally the question came regarding my salary. I do not consider it being a secret to my family so I simply told them (2.5x bigger than cousin's salary). 1st they thought I was joking until my MIL confirmed them that I really earn that much.  \nWhat was the response of everyone, even the cousin's response? \"Congrats for it! How you do it? That's why you keep visiting other countries\"", "The word \"emasculating\" generally makes me cringe. It implies that skill or dignity is a masculine thing, which is gross.", "Actually, it is possible. I'm the middle child (F) with an older sister and a younger brother.\nI wanted to play soccer but there was only a team for ages 13 and up. My sister found out and joined the team so I was copying her. I had only As and Bs without much effort and my siblings were in another school with bad grades. They got money for good grades and to me it was just like \"that B could have been an A\"\nMy brother is the prince, cause we have only female cousins and he is the only male and my sister was just the golden child.\nI didn't want to go NC without them knowing why. So before I moved out I sat my parents down and told them. How miserable I felt and that my siblings made it worse with their attitude. \nMy parents were stunned and my mom told me, that they cried together cause they never imagined that they made me feel like this. They felt horrible and they never realized how they treated me.\nNow, I have the best relationship with them. Maybe it's kind of a make up of the lost years or not. But I'm happy I told them.\nSo tldr: it is possible! Sometimes on purpose, sometimes they don't even realise", "I agree with you but I can't. Unfortunately I have to rely on them for the next 2 years ish. Due to many reasons. But when I do, I will ask those questions.", "Brother, mocked op for who knows how long and when called out for it, decided that a contest was the best course of action. Op didn\u2019t make the brother do anything, just indulged his fragile ego. If op was actually insecure in their ability, they wouldn\u2019t want to do the contest, they would just engage in actionless bluster\u2026 like the brother does.\n\nSometimes the best way to shut someone up is to cream them in contest.", "He deserves it", "Makes me think of step brothers lol", "OMG!!!! That's Olympic Gold Medal Petty. I salute you, Friend!", "And don\u2019t forget to \u2018blow\u2019 the smoke off of your index fingertips, Lol \ud83d\ude02", "Pew pew pew!", "LMAO! Priceless!", "Actually he didn\u2019t take his shot cause OP had to finish his shots !", "LMAO!", "Yes, it is, isn't it? LOL", "AGREED!!! Same deal in my family, except it was the youngest, the baby of the family.", "Now wait a minute!  He\u2019s the one that started boasting how he would kick your butt.  You finally let him prove it and provided all the equipment.  He gets his ass kicked by you, but blames YOU even though he asked for this?  Clearly he\u2019s the jackass and asshole here hands down.\n\nAnd your mother thinks you should apologize?  Yeah right!  You did nothing wrong.  How about tell her this\u2026*\u201dSure thing!  Tell him I am very sorry for not letting him cheat so he can feel like a big shot because that\u2019s exactly what you are asking me to do.\u201d*", "His bro has had a carb since 04", "And would ask his brother to take him shooting to learn some skills, and would have a great story over beers about how he expected to 'school' his brother and got his ass handed to him!", "Your brother is a petulant child, and your family enables that behavior at your expense. I'd go low or no contact with everyone except your SIL who probably will suffer the worst of the fallout from this. Every time they bar you from a family event until you apologize you should laugh and tell then to stop threatening you with a good time. Do. Not. Apologize. Ever.  You did nothing wrong.\n\nNTA, but your entire family basically is.", "Ouch!", "Keep practising there is no upper age limit for the Olympics", "You did what they do to you for years. Why you have to feel bad when they do not feel the same for you?", ">I wouldn\u2019t want to read too much into it\n\nThen *boy* are you on the wrong subreddit.\n\nIn all seriousness, if I had to make a more reasonable leap to conclusions, he\u2019d probably been talking about how he was gonna win non stop.", "With that family, I think I'd use \"special\" fingers for finger guns.", "Yup, I have a friend who is turning 50 this year who is training to compete in archery at the Olympics.", "Especially when the abuser is loved and fawned over by others.  He's a great dude and the center of our universe, so if he treats you like crap, it absolutely must be your fault.  /s", "Holy fucking shit Reddit, people read just a few paragraphs from a third party about this dude and are already taking conclusions that he's an abuser, his wife should leave him, his family should cut contact...\n\nThe brother was an ass in this account, but this is just one part of the story.", "Just because you excel at shooting doesnt mean that you cant excel at petty too. Not either / or.", "Ever heard of the term cover fire?  You shoot in the general direction of an enemy to pin them down, enabling your unit to move to a superior position (I have the high ground!) so that you can overwhelm them.\n\nAccuracy isn't the objective of the vast majority of rounds going downrange.", "Ex military? \"Combat trained\"? Exceptionally proud of their service, seemingly to the detriment of other traits? Family history of service? Family that takes umbrage at being shown out?\n\nThat's enough red flags for a May Day parade.", "New to Reddit, or just new to AITA?
