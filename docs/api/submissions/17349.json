But my brother decided that every opportunity he could he would explain to me that there is no way I'm that good, he is wayyyy better than me because he is \"combat trained.\" After a while of this, I called him out. A long argument later, he agreed to do a mock competition in front of the family by his invitation(mom, dad, SIL, and a few others).

By the last one came, we did the head to head, and I cleared my side. Then, he cleared half of his side.\n\nHe made excuses, which I would dismiss. I gave him multiple opertunites to restart or try again.  He then said that I was an AH for humiliating and demasculating him. My parents also called me an AH and some other words. SIL stayed quiet until we were packing up (me, my friend, SIL, and my gf. The rest were coddling my brother) she thanked me. My girlfriend asked if I really had to finish off his side. Which I admit was me showing off.\u00a0\n\nIt got to the point that my mom said I couldn't come over for Mother's Day until I apologized to my brother.

Which I admit was me showing off. \n\nI think by now it's clear that it is just not safe to spike the football on your brother.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that your brother has a right to have a friendly relationship with you, or vice-versa. I do not believe someone who loses a competition which began with some tension and animosity has a right to not be spanked and have the football spiked on them, especially after they bring an unwarranted amount of hype. I do not believe your parents and other members of the family have a right to have their \"golden child\" (and I think you called it) win every time. And neither do I believe you have a right to have good relations with your mother in this dynamic, which I consider toxic.\n\nNTA. It is your choice what bed to make.

Sorry about that.", "NTA. He talked trash for a long time before you challenged him to put up or shut up. And he didn't even acknowledge that you could be good. \"There's no way!\" He set himself up to be humiliated. He's the one who owes you an apology.\n\nUnless your brother was specifically in an infantry role, he probably only went to the shooting range once or twice during his eight years in the military. Even if he was in an infantry role and personally saw combat, there are huge differences between combat shooting and competition shooting. Weapons, technique, mindset, etc.\n\nThe two don't have a whole lot in common. He never should have assumed he could compete against you.", "SIL and I have a good relationship.

I think it is interesting shooting with people from different backgrounds, like you said, combat shooters and even different branches, LEO trained shooters, and other competitive shooters. They all have different styles and techniques. You can tell the difference between those who trained for what and how they were trained. For me, I feel like I am a mixed bag and found what worked for me. The community is amazing and very helpful when it comes to continuous improvement.", "No video tape. But there was a pic my friend took of when we were cleaning. I have a big smile on my face. My GF is looking at me in an meow kinda way. His wife has a small smile.

Give some to SIL to hide at my parents' place as well.\n\nYou are not helping my petty side.\n\nBut really, I think I am going to take that photo and crop out everyone but my GF and I. It is a good genuine pic of us. Of course, we would know the black story of it, but it is a really good pic."]}
