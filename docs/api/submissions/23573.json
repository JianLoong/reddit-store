I'm glad that your wife is attending therapy, but her anxiety is not an excuse. She needs to be held accountable for her actions. If her every waking thought is consumed by worry for your child, maybe it would be better for her to quit her job and be a SAHM. It's obvious she spends much of her time at work fretting over your daughter anyway. If she doesn't want to do that, she needs to seriously consider taking her prescribed medication to help manage her symptoms. She is becoming a nuisance to others because she is refusing to take care of herself.", "NTA Your wife is the reason day cares have contracts. If she continues to violate the contracts, you'll run out of options because it's a small world of providers and word gets around.", "NTA. Your wife is harassing and abusing the daycare workers.

No live feeds, no info. The daycare provider can provide a quick update at the end of the day and that is it.  If there is an issue that needs to be dealt with sooner, the provider can contact either of you, but your wife can't check in during the day.\n\nFor Alexis' sake, perhaps your wife needs more intensive therapy, I can't imagine that it is healthy for Alexis to have her mother so fraught with her every action that she becomes afraid to show any emotion as Mom will get upset.  Kids need emotions and they need to learn how to manage them, your wife is not allowing this - when she isn't even there!

This is a career I had worked very hard to build. In my opinion, if she wants to do all this, then she can be the one to stay home.\n\nRight so, that's fair but maybe not constructive because you've set up an oppositional situation between you and your wife, rather than working as a team to resolve this. I get that you've been trying to work as a team for years on this, but you don't get to up and say \"I'm  done\" when it comes to a kid and working with a coparent.\n\nNTA but real close for how you approached this.

It sounds like your wife is doing her part to try to mitigate her anxiety and work through this; however, you don't seem to be willing to make changes on your part.

Playing the devil's advocate, it's within the realm of possibility that OP isn't able to leave their job or able to search for other jobs and interview due to their work schedule. There are obviously ways to work around that and, u/OP, unless there is something about your current job that you really can't leave for, you should look for a job that isn't as demanding on your time. That is a good way to show your wife that not only are you aware of the struggles that she's encountering, but you're also willing to do what you need to do to free up more of your time to help take the stress off of her insofar as dealing with daycare's go.  \n\n\nI don't think anyone's the asshole in this situation. Being a parent is hard and postpartum depression makes things 10x harder on everyone. Men can get it too and if you feel hopeless or powerless OP, you might want to get into therapy too, and also get couples counseling for both of you together too. I know answering unmet expectations with compassion instead of anger is exhausting and wears you down more. You won't help her by getting directive with her and telling her how she's falling short. I know you aren't doing it to be mean or hurtful and that it's coming from a place of hurt within yourself. You can only control your actions though and by doing things to treat yourself and free up some of your time, she gets something tangible to hold on to and help her move forward herself.", "There\u2019s not much I can do about this, though, without losing my job. I have tried to help her as much as I can by talking to her about it, encouraging her to go to therapy, doing all of the housework and caring for our daughter after hours. \n\nBut I can\u2019t change that I\u2019m unavailable when at work and can\u2019t do pick ups.

When my sis had it the therapist worked first on detachment and anxiety. She went for 2 years after 1 she was completely different. Helped tremendously. She went for another year to deal with her own issues that led to it. She did have to take and try different meds for that time as some mg didn\u2019t help or were to much. The therapist may not be a good fit. But your wife and you are in for some big issues and she\u2019s not taking any accountability for what really is happening. And she\u2019s also not realizing her PPD will get worse for your daughter is she isn\u2019t socialized.", "If her therapy team has encouraged her to take medication, consider talking with her and making it a requirement that she try medication for a set period of time. \n\nI\u2019m also curious if she recognizes that her behaviors while anxious are not reasonable or if she thinks it\u2019s normal for a parent to be this aggressive with childcare staff because she seems to be making excuses. I get panicky in heavy traffic and have had multiple panic attacks where I\u2019ve had to open the door and throw up. I don\u2019t think that is \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d in response to the situation even though I\u2019m anxious and panicked about it.

If you stayed home with your daughter she\u2019d just be checking with you all the time so if anyone ends up needing to stay home it should be your wife as she\u2019s the one who has anxiety being away from your daughter. This situation isn\u2019t good for any of you long term.", "Then her therapy isn't working.

She needs a different therapist who will hold her toes to the fire. Her child deserves it. \n\nOP, I grew up with someone whose mom was like your wife. Looking back, I'm not able to call it anything other than child abuse. My friend was not free to develop as an individual or as a peer who had strong relationship skills because of her mother. Her mom even watch us at recess from the roof of a nearby building. It was truly so so sad to watch my friend's education suffer... and it was also truthfully terrifying for us classmates because we couldn't understand why someone's mom thought the teacher was so \"wrong\" all the time. It made us question if we were safe with the teachers, or if they taught us dangerous things. Frankly? Your wife is not entitled to inflict that kind of stress on your kid's classmates and their families. \n\nShe's being so much worse than just anxious. She's selfish and abusive. And this *must* stop.

Throwing your hands up in the air and saying \u201cI can\u2019t make her do anything\u201d while simultaneously saying \u201cI\u2019m going to make her quit her job if we get kicked out of this daycare\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense.", "I mean, you absolutely can make taking medication a requirement for a continued marriage and her having custody of your child. You can literally say \u201cthis is untenable. I need you to try medication or we cannot continue this marriage and I will seek primary custody of our child\u201d. You can\u2019t force it down her throat, but you can say \u201cI won\u2019t continue living like this\u201d. \n\nThat she thinks you\u2019re bullying her as you\u2019re trying to work towards a solution screams to me that she\u2019s not engaging in therapy in good faith. I say that as someone who has previously not engaged in therapy in good faith and it damaged my relationships. I obviously don\u2019t know your wife but if she\u2019s with a therapist that is encouraging her to say things like \u201cI can\u2019t help that I have anxiety\u201d or she\u2019s just not listening to her therapist and saying that anyway, her treatment isn\u2019t working.", "Can\u2019t if she doesn\u2019t want to go. \n\nNo, due to the nature of my job I often don\u2019t have my phone on me. I do drop offs 99% of the time but can only pick up once a week."]}
