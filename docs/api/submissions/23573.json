Something tells me this degree of overbearance will not solve itself over time with only the help of talk therapy.", "NTA. I'm glad that your wife is attending therapy, but her anxiety is not an excuse. She needs to be held accountable for her actions. If her every waking thought is consumed by worry for your child, maybe it would be better for her to quit her job and be a SAHM. It's obvious she spends much of her time at work fretting over your daughter anyway.

She is becoming a nuisance to others because she is refusing to take care of herself.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your wife is harassing and abusing the daycare workers.

No live feeds, no info. The daycare provider can provide a quick update at the end of the day and that is it.  If there is an issue that needs to be dealt with sooner, the provider can contact either of you, but your wife can't check in during the day.\n\nFor Alexis' sake, perhaps your wife needs more intensive therapy, I can't imagine that it is healthy for Alexis to have her mother so fraught with her every action that she becomes afraid to show any emotion as Mom will get upset.  Kids need emotions and they need to learn how to manage them, your wife is not allowing this - when she isn't even there!  I fair for Alexis if you pull her out of daycare and she is with your wife 24/7.", "Something doesn't make sense here, how can you not afford daycare but can afford to lose ~half your household income?", "Absolutely Nta.

To keep it 100% honest with you. 20 years down the line, your daughter is going to hate your wife and there\u2019s a high chance she will not be part of your lives.\n\nYour wife is the exact definition of a toxic helicopter parent, she\u2019s going to not only ruin your life (already in that process), your daughters life in the future, and her own life.", "NTA. You should discuss with her considering this is your last option that you will be the contact for the daycare.", "NTA.

This is a career I had worked very hard to build. In my opinion, if she wants to do all this, then she can be the one to stay home.\n\nRight so, that's fair but maybe not constructive because you've set up an oppositional situation between you and your wife, rather than working as a team to resolve this. I get that you've been trying to work as a team for years on this, but you don't get to up and say \"I'm  done\" when it comes to a kid and working with a coparent.\n\nNTA but real close for how you approached this.

Playing the devil's advocate, it's within the realm of possibility that OP isn't able to leave their job or able to search for other jobs and interview due to their work schedule. There are obviously ways to work around that and, u/OP, unless there is something about your current job that you really can't leave for, you should look for a job that isn't as demanding on your time. That is a good way to show your wife that not only are you aware of the struggles that she's encountering, but you're also willing to do what you need to do to free up more of your time to help take the stress off of her insofar as dealing with daycare's go.  \n\n\nI don't think anyone's the asshole in this situation. Being a parent is hard and postpartum depression makes things 10x harder on everyone. Men can get it too and if you feel hopeless or powerless OP, you might want to get into therapy too, and also get couples counseling for both of you together too. I know answering unmet expectations with compassion instead of anger is exhausting and wears you down more. You won't help her by getting directive with her and telling her how she's falling short. I know you aren't doing it to be mean or hurtful and that it's coming from a place of hurt within yourself. You can only control your actions though and by doing things to treat yourself and free up some of your time, she gets something tangible to hold on to and help her move forward herself.", "There\u2019s not much I can do about this, though, without losing my job.

When my sis had it the therapist worked first on detachment and anxiety. She went for 2 years after 1 she was completely different. Helped tremendously. She went for another year to deal with her own issues that led to it. She did have to take and try different meds for that time as some mg didn\u2019t help or were to much. The therapist may not be a good fit. But your wife and you are in for some big issues and she\u2019s not taking any accountability for what really is happening. And she\u2019s also not realizing her PPD will get worse for your daughter is she isn\u2019t socialized.", "If her therapy team has encouraged her to take medication, consider talking with her and making it a requirement that she try medication for a set period of time. \n\nI\u2019m also curious if she recognizes that her behaviors while anxious are not reasonable or if she thinks it\u2019s normal for a parent to be this aggressive with childcare staff because she seems to be making excuses. I get panicky in heavy traffic and have had multiple panic attacks where I\u2019ve had to open the door and throw up. I don\u2019t think that is \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d in response to the situation even though I\u2019m anxious and panicked about it.

This situation isn\u2019t good for any of you long term.", "Then her therapy isn't working. By refusing the take her meds, she is choosing to allow her need for control to override her child's need for development and education. She needs a different therapist who will hold her toes to the fire. Her child deserves it. \n\nOP, I grew up with someone whose mom was like your wife. Looking back, I'm not able to call it anything other than child abuse. My friend was not free to develop as an individual or as a peer who had strong relationship skills because of her mother. Her mom even watch us at recess from the roof of a nearby building. It was truly so so sad to watch my friend's education suffer... and it was also truthfully terrifying for us classmates because we couldn't understand why someone's mom thought the teacher was so \"wrong\" all the time. It made us question if we were safe with the teachers, or if they taught us dangerous things. Frankly? Your wife is not entitled to inflict that kind of stress on your kid's classmates and their families. \n\nShe's being so much worse than just anxious. She's selfish and abusive. And this *must* stop.

You're both going to need to do a lot of work to make a better home for your child. You need to be a lot more assertive - your child is already being hurt by her behavior. 1.

Clear a time to sit down with her and discuss the situation\n2. Explain that you have tried to support her and allow her to navigate her anxiety on her terms (*if that's true, of course)*. You understand how difficult it has been and want to keep supporting her. However, the current method *is not working*. You have lost placement in two day cares and are close to losing the third because she is either unable or unwilling to control her behavior. This is hurting your child and you.\n3. Changing her current behavior will mean leaving her comfort zone and doing things that may feel challenging or threatening. You want to be there to support her but that means you need to be involved.\n4. Come up with a plan of action for the next week. Couples therapy must be on that list. Follow through.\n5. Remember that change is terrifying, and the way she's living right now may be painful but it's a comfortable painful - it hurts, but it's a known hurt. Change brings unknown hurts, and that's a threat. You will become a threat by demanding change, and she will go on the defensive to avoid suffering. It's a natural response. Try to avoid feeding into it and stick to \"we need to come up with our next step\" instead of rushing to comfort or becoming angry yourself.

There needs to be therapy plus a medication to take daily, plus a medication for when she feel she can't \"pump the breaks\". It doesn't have to be forever, but doing a short term treatment with meds can take the \"edge\" off, which will help her in the long run.\n\nIt makes me wonder if she is anxious or controlling in other ways, because she isn't just anxious, she is trying to control the environment around her so she doesn't feel anxious.

Therapy can be her thing for her anxiety but if she wants this marriage to last and for the mental health of your daughter, she needs to do marriage counseling.

It's a lot of hard work but realising that that's where you can make the change means realising you have the power to change that, by consistently challenging those thoughts and feelings to get them where you want them to be.

My guess is your wife is not being honest with her therapist because she knows she\u2019s spiraling and the therapist will have to take action. You\u2019ve said there\u2019s been no progress in a year and that some things have gotten worse. Either her therapist sucks or your wife is lying to them. You can email or call her therapist and have a one-sided conversation about what and how\u2019s she\u2019s doing. I\u2019ve done this with my mother, and while they couldn\u2019t tell me anything the insights that I provided were valuable as she was outright lying to her therapist. My husband has done this for me when I\u2019m in crisis. \n\nHonestly? You\u2019re a doormat and are excusing her behavior. Hundreds of people have given you great advice as to what you probably should do. At this point your marriage should be contingent on medication, family therapy, and her allowing her therapist to be open with you about how her treatment is going and telling you, to a limited degree, what she\u2019s telling the them. \n\nAnd you say you can\u2019t be the primary contact for daycare because you can\u2019t talk to them? Why? The only reason your daycare should be communicating during the day is if there\u2019s an emergency. There is no reason for them to \u201ccheck in\u201d during the day or have to answer 1000 questions that are either pointless, intrusive, or could be communicated at pickup or drop off. \n\nI have volunteered in the mental health field working with people of all ages from small children to geriatrics for years. I\u2019ve seen women just like your wife, and I\u2019ve seen kids that grew up with parents like your wife, and even you. Your wife is doing your daughter no favors and will almost guarantee that she will be alienated from peers, behind developmentally and socially, will not be able to function as an adult, and possibly she will estrange herself from you and your wife as soon as she possibly can. And your wife is putting herself through the mental ringer and there will almost certainly come a point where she is unable to handle it. You are enabling all of it. \n\nYour wife is in danger. Your daughter is in danger. Your life with your family is in danger. You <b>have</b> to do better. You can\u2019t sweep this under the rug. You have to put your foot down. \n\nFrom a personal note I also live with mental illness, have been diagnosed and living with it for over 20 years. When my husband and I got serious he gave me an ultimatum - take care of your mental health and I will always support and stand by you. Even if I\u2019m in an episode and everything has gone sideways, which does happen from time to time despite medication and therapy and constant work at it, but as long as I\u2019m reaching out for help and actively trying, he\u2019s there. I\u2019m well aware that if I stop meds, therapy, etc. he will leave. And guess what - we\u2019ve both held up our end of the bargain. Even when shit is absolutely down the drain, as long as I\u2019m trying he\u2019ll be there in whatever capacity I need him to be. \n\nYour wife is not even trying. She hasn\u2019t given up, she just doesn\u2019t even care. She doesn\u2019t care about the strain she\u2019s putting on you or your marriage. She doesn\u2019t care about the damage she\u2019s doing to your daughter. And she doesn\u2019t care because you have sat back and just let all of it happen. \n\nHonestly? You\u2019re an idiot. You come here asking for advice but keep trying to explain everything away or say I can\u2019t or I won\u2019t. But at what point will you? When will too much be too much? This is your life too that she\u2019s holding hostage. It\u2019s up to you. But do it for your daughter if nothing else.", "OMG I\u2019m laughing because above i commented and listed a few things my kids did or had done to them lol, and I forgot 2 of the 3 broke their arms at school on the monkey bars \ud83d\ude05.

This is the sort of industrial grade anxiety that can escalate to full blown psychosis. She needs help before it comes to that.", "Hail Marcus", "Your wife is right, it's not her fault she is anxious, but it is her responsibility to manage it effectively. She cannot use it as an excuse for her behavior, though she probably uses it in all sorts of ways.\n\nIf I can offer one piece of advice as a parent, it's that parenting is the act of letting go. You love, teach, train, and prepare these little folks for their lives, but the entire time, they're one step ahead of you (at least!). That's because you're raising an adult. You're teaching them life skills and they are going to have bumps in the road. Kids are going to steal their toys at daycare, they're going to fall off a bike, and everything else. She needs to be there for comfort and support, but she can't be there always. And, because she can't be there always, she has to let go. It's not easy, but your little one will thrive by learning to rise to the challenges without mommy interceding constantly and using her own anxiety as the excuse.\n\nNTA, obviously. And I wish you luck dealing with this situation. Your little one is too valuable to have this be an ongoing issue.", ">I was pissed. When Alexis went to bed that night, my wife and I talked. I said this was our last option for daycare. The other centers are too expensive and this was the only home daycare in the area that we like. A nanny is not in our budget. My wife made a million excuses, including that it\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s anxious. I said if we are asked to leave this program too, my wife will be the one quitting her job to watch Alexis, not me. This upset my wife. I pointed out I\u2019ve spoken to her kindly about this plenty of times. I encourage her to keep up her therapy. But she can\u2019t keep getting us kicked out of programs. My wife is now not speaking to me.\n\nMy bio mother was a bit like this and we are going at almost a decade no contact. OP you are NTA and from what you have described it sounds like your wife needs firm boundaries and therapy. I am begging you to please protect Alexis. The last thing that kid needs is to be around her mother all day. The amount of anxiety and isolation I dealt with from elementary school age on is not an experience I wish on any child.", "Gah, could you imagine the behavior towards OP following a divorce? All that anxiety on him now and how he can\u2019t do anything right? This poor guy.", "No she doesn't. She's just texting all day from the sounds of it. I wouldn't want her pretending to assist my kid, and she's really just texting her daycare all day. How does she even still have a job?", "Honestly- it will absolutely reach the point where this woman will kick Alexis out, no matter how much money she needs. And if she doesn\u2019t have a waiting list I\u2019ll be surprised. \n\nYour wife is banking on this woman being desperate as an excuse to abuse her. That\u2019s absolutely deplorable.", "Hail yourself!", "You are beyond right. OP is not the asshole. I work at a university and you have no idea how many parents call me because their child failed a class or didn\u2019t meet a basic requirement for their degree due to the child\u2019s own negligence (e.g. how difficult is it to submit a 2 page summary of your experience at your required internship within three months of completing said internship?) and the parent expects me to somehow excuse their adult child and the child expects me to give in and waive requirements because mommy and daddy asked. \n\nLong story short, this kind of behavior can have long-lasting consequences on a child because it doesn\u2019t magically dissipate or disappear as the child ages. OP\u2019s wife needs serious professional help now and not some namby-pamby therapy. I mean real psychological help. Your wife doesn\u2019t need psychobabble about boundaries or other such nonsense, she needs real serious help because this is not even approaching normal behavior for a parent.", "The last point is the most important. Unresolved anxiety in parents has been demonstrated to be nearly 100% correlative with anxiety in progeny. It\u2019s non correlative with genetics. Your wife is the only one harming your daughter.

I\u2019ve got zero confidence or life skills. I tried really hard in college to get my mom to teach me how to take care of my own stuff, like taxes, or not have a tracker on me, but it never worked and honestly broke me down further. I understand she\u2019s not 100% responsible and I\u2019m still an adult and it\u2019s up to me to get it together. But I will say her helicopter parenting really set me up for failure in a way that has made my 20\u2019s very painful and lost an amazing relationship and really becoming my own person because of it. I\u2019m working hard on it now. But it\u2019s been a really hard and long roadblock. \n\nThe other thing that made it so difficult was because she loves me so damn much, made it hard to cut her off or tell her no. My dad was diagnosed with a bunch of mental illnesses right before I was born, and dealing with my father, and my older brothers issues along with working full time from home and homeschooling us, she was loosing it mentally and invested in her children to keep her strong. When my brother turned 18 moved out without telling anyone and cut off my parents for a year or so. This really made my mom double down on investing in me. I understand and sympathize where she\u2019s coming from, and my heart breaks for how freakin much she cares for me, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m responsible for her happiness and although I want nothing more than to make her happy, I can\u2019t live my own life, I ultimately can\u2019t be responsible for her happiness. It\u2019s been a really painful process. \n\nOP is NTA - but idk if having your wife stay at home with your daughter is the best solution. Although I get there doesn\u2019t seem to be any other good solution, I\u2019d really push for more therapy on top of what she\u2019s already doing and holding strong to not micromanaging your daughters life.

She didn't take us places, she didn't help with homework, she would go out all the time on dates or with her friends. A lot of times she wouldn't even come home. She would barely ever cook dinner. It was mostly chef boyardee ravioli or off brand box Mac and cheese with hotdogs cooked by 12, 13, 14, or 15 yr old me. I guess it taught me independence and self-sufficiency since she also kicked me out on my 17th birthday. Granted by then I was a pretty fucked up juvenile delinquent. I didn't really give her much of an option as I had just withdrawn myself from school and she wasn't going to be getting child support payments anymore for me. She said \"I'm not going to get paid anymore to put up with your bullshit if you aren't in school so get the fuck out my house.\"\n\nI ended up going to the penitentiary for meth and burglary charges 3 years later. \n\nSometimes I wish my mom would have been a helicopter mom but really I just wish she had cared just a little bit. Maybe I wouldn't have fucked up so much early in life. Maybe I would have done something differently. Who knows. I like where I am in life now though.", "Your story has some similarities to my husband's. He didn't realize how unhealthy his family was until he met mine. He couldn't believe they talked to me as an equal adult. I even said \"no\" to something! When we got in my car to leave, he sat there with a blank expression, as he stared at nothing. Something clicked in that moment. \n\nHe started to realize how much anxiety he had around his family. He thought about how isolated they kept him, and how they chased everyone away. I learned why his self confidence was low from the stories he hadn't thought of as anything notable at the time.\n\nHe had already moved out, and that was okay with his family. It was when we bought a house together that everything imploded. I don't have to tell you how ugly it got. After a month of constant escalation, we went to the police. \n\nIt's been 10+ years with no contact, and he is *thriving.* It took a lot of time to understand how controlling they'd been, and what wasn't actually \"normal.\" He was finally free to be the person I already knew was in there. \n\nAnyway, the reason I shared all that was to illustrate how I at least have a small understanding of what you went through. I wanted my words to carry a little weight when I say this: you are incredible! The strength you harnessed from deep within is humbling; that fire couldn't be extinguished. You found a path forward with the help of a therapist, and you seized it. I am in awe.\n\nMy husband is an amazing man, and he's more than I could have ever hoped for. I'm incredibly proud of him. I can't help but be proud of you as well, even though I'm just a random person from the internet.\n\nI wish you nothing but the best \ud83d\udc9c", "Yes exactly. This comment reminds of years ago. We had a group of high school friends and we all were having babies at the same time in our mid 20's. One of our friends was turning out to be exactly like this mom. Her kid was hitting a lot. Trying to hurt pets etc. To the point the other kids were begging for him not to come to birthday parties etc. We were still young moms back in the 80'and had not learned assertiveness. So we had a hard time confronting her about her son's behavior. At one point my sister got so disgusted she told her child to hit him back if he hit her again. My sister's little girl was 4 and problem child was about 6 months older. Well problem child hit my niece, niece hit back, our friend loses it with her poor boy crying and all, my sis says, well I guess my daughter had enough of being hit, so she hit back. Our soon to be ex friend responds, she shouldn't have hit him, he's too young to understand being hit back. She needs to be punished. Honest to God! Nowadays through the grapevine I hear he's still a bully. In his late 30's.", "OP should propose a joint session as one of the requests/changes that he wants to see as a result of her continuing this obsession/disorder.", ">we never went anywhere that didn't result in an hour-long conversation with any employee we ran into\n\nThat's exhausting in its own right lol", "This is deeply disturbing and I cant imagine watching that level of learned helplessness in a child. I hope OP hears so many people begging him to take drastic action, your example included.", "That was my first tought.  \n\n\nAnd it's far beyond Reddit grade at this point :/", "Not sure if you will see this (or if others have proposed it as well), but would asking her about how she would talk to parents if they acted that way with her make her reflect a bit more on her own behavior?\n\nI imagine it is most likely a question/angle you already tried with her, but I figured I'd mention it is just in case. \n\nHow micromanaging the educators in the daycare won't help anyone, especially not your child's growth (things like social skills and the likes)", "I have anxiety (sometimes it\u2019s mildly crippling) but I will be damned if I don\u2019t get the fuck over it and allow my son to live. He has stayed over at my sisters twice now (two different sisters) and yes, I cried. I need to deal with MY problems and not let him take those on. Op is NTA but the mom needs to chill and stay in therapy, or take meds if it\u2019s really that bad. There no shame in needing meds. I take them when it gets bad and it makes me a better mom for my son.", "I really hope OP sees this comment. MAYBE it could help his wife understand.", "She needs to cold turkey quit and block any monitoring of the childcare and no more texting. She should set up a schedule for husband to check it on his lunch but no more than that (because of his not having phone on him)", "Teachers and mentors will hate her too, because they associate her with being harassed by her mother, who will probably also be trying to get them fired for not doing what she wants.", "I literally have only one friend because my parents basically never let me out of their sight. \n\nI've had guys say \"Of course, I don't talk to you. Your dad's always around\"\n\nAnd now they wonder why I'm single and have no friends. OP, the commenter future above was right. You do not want your daughter to be me.", "How is her work performance not suffering from this level of obsessing??? It sounds as if she doesn\u2019t focus on anything else all day.\n\nI feel for you OP. You and your wife have a very long road ahead of you!", ">Daycare should block the wife.  \n\nUnfortunately, this would likely cause the wife to try even more drastic measures of trying to contact the daycare provider.", "I would also like to point out to u/Spirited_Block_6783 that if you know your co parent is harming your child (and you are being told your wife's behaviour is doing harm, so from this point forward you have no excuse but to do better), and you choose to keep the peace rather than call out the abuse and protect your child, you are choosing to neglect your child, and that is a type of abuse.

Wife has refused, and when she did, he just shrugged his shoulders and did nothing else.", "ack, this reminds me of another reddit post about the little girl who wasn't invited to a classmate's birthday party.  Turns out the poster's daughter tells on the other children to the teacher on a regular basis, and scolds them for running and other 'unsafe' behavior, because her mother fully emphasizes rules and safety. None of the other children want that girl at their parties. Helicopter parenting is not doing your child any favors!", "And your little girl needs a child therapist ASAP. No doubt she's blaming herself for getting \"kicked out\" of every place she goes, separated from new friends and starting over.", "Yeah.. leaving this anxious and irrational parent at home with your child all day every day alone m is not ideal when she\u2019s in this state. \n\nAlso\u2026 how is she even still employed at whatever job she evidently does if she\u2019s on the phone harassing daycare staff all day?", "I believe most daycares begin planning lessons from a very young age. It's reasonable to expect a standard education plan for each individual age group but not each individual kid.", "My whole goal as a mother is to NOT be like this.", "This is an excellent comment and I hope OP grasps the severity of the situation and the importance of what you are saying. This woman is seriously mentally abusing her daughter and the day care staff and trying to gaslight her husband for his extremely valid outlook. This is one of those rare instances in which threats of divorce and his wife losing custody of the kid are not only reasonable but vital before a little girl ends up irreparably damaged.", "He needs to leave her and take the little girl.

Ultimately, no one is responsible for the child beside her parents and no other person should be subject to the mother's control issues. \n\nIf she is unable or unwilling to address her anxieties and the unacceptable behaviors she engages in to assuage them, OP should consider terminating his contract with her as well.", "Even when I am not working and have absolutely nothing to do, it doesn't even occur to me to watch the daycare live feed very often", "This is absolutely a thing OP. Call her therapist and tell her you need to set up a session so you can talk about some things going on with the mrs.
