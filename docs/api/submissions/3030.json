They had two boys together (7 and 6) and I have made my peace with the fact that she will always love him. She even has a sort of shrine to him in our home and I would never ask her to remove it.\n\nWe got married only a couple of years ago and last Thanksgiving she asked me to come with her to Thanksgiving at her former in-laws house. Apparently she's gone to their house for Thanksgiving since her first husband died. I support this as it's a way for her to stay connected to her first husband's family and also since it's a way for her two kids to maintain a relationship with their father's side of the family.\n\nSo, I went last year. It was a little uncomfortable, but her late husband's family treated me really well. They were very kind and welcoming to me. It wasn't a bad Thanksgiving, but it was still really awkward and I felt very out of place.\n\nThis year my wife is trying to get me to go back, but I just want to go have Thanksgiving with my own family. I've invited her along but also told her that I understand if she doesn't want to go, but that we should be moving forward. But if she doesn't want to fine, but that she shouldn't try to make me go to Thanksgiving at her late husband's family's home. She's responded that we can have Christmas, Easter, the Fourth of July, etc with either her family or my family but that she's pledged Thanksgiving to her late husband's family and that I should come with her as her husband to support her.

They\u2019re going to want to know about the dad they didn\u2019t get to know, yet the dad they do know is uncomfortable with it. You don\u2019t technically owe him or his parents any favors, but you are raising his kids. You\u2019re going to be their dad and do all the things that this other guy and his parents probably dreamed about. If you only see them one day a year, you can use that to learn one thing about this other guy, and you can tell the kids about it on a random day.

And I think if anything, seeing you interact with those kids would give them a lot more comfort than you not showing up. I don\u2019t know. I imagine being your wife and I\u2019d want them to know I was making good choices for the grandkids and if you showed up that would be a huge yes. I know you don\u2019t owe them that, but it just seems like this situation could be a lot more meaningful for you than anyone else to connect to the dad for your kids. It doesn\u2019t have to be awkward, what would you want him to do if roles were reversed and he was with your parents?

If she wasn't ready to move on, she shouldn't have gotten into another relationship. I understand remembering her ex, especially for her sons, but she also needs to live more in the present and less in the past.", "NAH.  I can see how that would be really awkward and you don't want to go.  It's great that you encourage her and the kids to go and your wife shouldn't pressure you about it.", "NAH. Yes it's a different scenario but they will forever be the children's grandparents. If this is literally the only day of the year you see them I get how awkward it must feel but again remember... grandparents.", "NAH her pledge was made as a single woman. Life changed mean that things change. I would never ask someone to stop loving someone because of the misfortune of death.

She sounds like she wasn't ready to move on with her life, honestly. If going there for Thanksgiving is a situation where she feels she needs your support to get through, why is she so determined to stick herself into it? Why would she not just celebrate the holiday in a way that doesn't require extra emotional support? Regardless, you have the right to be comfortable on *your* holidays; you're not demanding that she stop going over there & accompany you instead.", "NTA a fair compromise is alternating where you go each year, or just her and her sons going. You never getting to celebrate Thanksgiving with your family again because she isn\u2019t over her former husband is not fair.", "NTA that's just creepy and honestly emotionally abusive.\n\nShe has a *shrine* to her late husband in your home?\n\nEh sorry, that's really fucked up. I don't know how can be with someone who loves someone else, but don't let manipulate you into going to her ex husbands family home that's really really messed up.\n\nShe in therapy?", "NTA because you're fine doing your own thing and aren't forcing her to choose.   \n  \nDo they see their father's family other times of the year?

If that's a thing, because what then?  \n  \nAs someone with little family connection, the ideal I'd see is if you could host everyone but yeah.", "YTA - I would think your wife was the asshole if her ex chose to be out of your kids lives or was trying to stay in your wife\u2019s life, but that\u2019s not what this dinner is about, and when you chose to marry your wife you chose to also be a father. You can\u2019t choose one without the other in this situation, you\u2019re the only one they\u2019re going to have now. But you seem to me making this decision as a husband, and you should be making it as a husband _and_ father.

This dinner isn\u2019t for your wife, it\u2019s for your kids.", "NTA She pledged it for herself and the kids -she had no right to do that on your behalf. The only compromise is to choose one the big events that she and the kids can go to the grandparents house without you. Maybe switch it to 4th of July, or maybe they can go more regularly and not have it on a big holiday.

I am someone who has been in this very situation. My husband died when my kids were very young (4yrs old and 4 months old). I remarried a few years later. I always referred to my first husband's family as the kids granny, the kids uncle, etc. There were times we would take the kids to their granny's house for Thanksgiving and we would go his family's or my family's. We just did something different each year. My current husband actually really likes the kids granny and aunt/uncle etc. There's never been any tension there at all. We have on occasion, had a meal together. But if OPs husband is uncomfortable he shouldn't be expected to attend. \n\nAnother thing I think about this post is that his wife shouldn't have a \"shrine to her late husband\" in their house. Listen, nobody ever loved a man more than I loved and still love my first husband. I thought I would grow old with him and we were the other half of each other's hearts. But I also love my current husband and I don't think, even though he is well aware of how I feel and is completely understanding of the situation, that it's fair to him to have something like that in the home he and I live in together. Instead, what I did was, put a picture of their dad in each of my kids rooms. Its a matter of respect for the person who has taken on the role of helping you raise and love and provide for your children. I wish them the best.", "I think this is a great sentiment.

I think it\u2019s just one of those things that might be split for the holidays, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.", "Yep. I can only imagine how hard it is to be the second spouse of a widower and all the complicated feelings that accompany that, but I really hope OP can see how unsustainable this \"its time to move on\" mindset is. Whether he realizes it or not, these people are permanent fixtures of his family now. Not only do his children obviously love their grandparents, but it's very likely that his wife sees them as loved ones as well. If OP can't make peace with that then this relationship has an expiration date.", "This is a very good way of looking at it. I never even thought of that until you mentioned it.", "Well there's a small caveat that most of the replies have missed, the tradition of going there exclusively for Thanksgiving came _*after*_ the first husband died, it wasn't established beforehand. The tradition came from a place of grief and wasn't something that was established before his death, so going there seems more like a somber reminder of his death, or some sort of guilt for not going there more often when he was alive rather than a reminder of his life, so I can see why this might be a problem for OP. That would certainly be a rather uncomfortable position to be in.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, having one holiday earmarked for just one family isn't a compromise, it's actually rather unfair. What if his family decides to have other holidays elsewhere that precludes OP from being able to see them when his family in town? What if he has multiple siblings and it's the only time of year they get together that year? Does he have to wait an entire year to see his whole family again? That seems blatantly unfair. They children's grandparents could be invited to her parents house as a straight compromise, or even, if it's not too awkward, to his parents house, that way they can see the grandkids, and he's not on the defensive being somewhere he feels uncomfortable.\n\nThere's also the quote on quote shrine in the house, which I think this post, as others have pointed out, is more about his wife not being able to fully move on from her first husband's death, which is understandable, but she should never have gotten into a relationship let alone remarried if she wasn't completely at peace with his passing. This leads me to think that beyond the shrine and exclusive Thanksgiving demand, he may be compared a lot to the first husband, so that also may explain some of his responses, and would also shed some light on referring to them as _her former in-laws_ and _first husband's family_.\n\nEDIT: misspellings", "I disagree about Op not being an AH in this. He married his wife and this is now his family also. He says that he accepts her love for her late husband,  then says they need to move forward from seeing the grandparents  because  it's \"weird and morbid\". \n\nKeeping in contact with people who love you is not weird and morbid.

They are essentially, a second set of parents to her and she considers them part of her family.   \nIn that case, asking you as her new husband to join her in a family gathering with them is no different than asking to go visit any other close parental figures.

If he's truly uncomfortable about being with the kid's grandparents then it is what it is but if he's more concerned about wanting to see his family and she's concerned about her kids seeing their paternal relatives than just visit both? There's a lot of ways to compromise in this situation", "He can both be there for them but still spend the night hella uncomfortable and full of intrusive thoughts. Humans don't come with a button to cut awkwardness off and imo is unfair to judge a guy for that when he accepts that they are gonna spend it separately.", "OP has a valid right to be with his own family on Thanksgiving as well though?", "I 100% agree maintaining contact with dads family is super important.  They should be seeing them more than once a year on Thanksgiving.  Why wouldn't they get Christmas or Christmas eve or Easter on occasion instead of Thanksgiving? Or even in addition.  Rotating the holidays allows everyone's traditions to be maintained and keep the kids tied to their dad.  I don't think OP has to go every time but should go regularly enough. In my family, Thanksgiving is the most important holiday.  I would be quite upset if my partner decided unilaterally that I could never see my family for Thanksgiving again.  Also, Thanksgiving is a 4 day weekend,  I don't think being creative and alternating which day is celebrated is unreasonable either. We often alternate between Thursday and Saturday to accommodate in laws.", "Absolutely. But that isn\u2019t the issue that OP is presenting.

Sometimes as an adult you have to do things you don\u2019t want to do. This is one of those things. He\u2019s not being asked to do anything but make polite conversation for a few hours.
