Apparently she's gone to their house for Thanksgiving since her first husband died. I support this as it's a way for her to stay connected to her first husband's family and also since it's a way for her two kids to maintain a relationship with their father's side of the family.\n\nSo, I went last year. It was a little uncomfortable, but her late husband's family treated me really well. They were very kind and welcoming to me. It wasn't a bad Thanksgiving, but it was still really awkward and I felt very out of place.\n\nThis year my wife is trying to get me to go back, but I just want to go have Thanksgiving with my own family. I've invited her along but also told her that I understand if she doesn't want to go, but that we should be moving forward. But if she doesn't want to fine, but that she shouldn't try to make me go to Thanksgiving at her late husband's family's home. She's responded that we can have Christmas, Easter, the Fourth of July, etc with either her family or my family but that she's pledged Thanksgiving to her late husband's family and that I should come with her as her husband to support her.

It's a lovely tradition to keep up. But if it makes you uncomfortable, you can choose not to go. \n\nBut I think It's a bit of a low call to call them her \"late husband's family\" when they're actually her children's family, and it's important for them to keep that connection up. And your and her family do get every other holiday all through the year.", "NAH...I understand her feelings, and wanting to take her children. The level of awkwardness must extremely uncomfortable for you though. Perhaps just going separate ways on that one holiday is the best compromise.", "NAH - but learn to compromise. It\u2019s one holiday and it\u2019s important to her.", "NAH. But honestly - this is those kids grandparents and family. Please encourage and support those kids having a real and full relationship with their family. Negotiate with your wife about how to do this. Whether you choose Thanksgiving or not is up to you and her - those kids need extended family.", "NAH. This is for the kids. They lost their dad really young and this is the only holiday she gives them with them per your post. I can see you doing different things that day if it really bothers you but if you could deal with it being kind of uncomfortable for the kids sake I think that would be amazing.", "NAH- She wants to have this chance for her kids to spend time with dad's parents, which has to mean a lot for Grandparents and kids alike. You two need to talk with both each other first and also make sure to find out if the boys have opinions. They might want you there, they might not, they might not care, but even at their age, it's important that they feel that their feelings have been listened to.", "NAH, you'll have to agree to disagree.", "NAH.  A lovely sentiment that borders on creepy.  You went once which was plenty.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re in a partnership. I cannot imagine how hard this is for her but I\u2019m disappointed that she isn\u2019t willing to see that there should be a new balance struck with you that works for your new family. \n\nI understand wanting to honour the memory of her first husband and the grandparents of their children together. However I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to alternate on high-value holidays (Thanksgiving seems to be one of the biggest holidays in the US to those of us outside of the states).", "NAH. I understand that it can be awkward but they are the kids family too, it's only one holyday if a you say you divide the others between you families, I see how can be hard for you but I think you will make better points with your wife by going.", "NAH ....I say this as a widower. I really respect that you've accepted he will always be in her heart. And, speaking from her POV, it doesn't mean less room for you, just different room. \n\nConsidering it isn't *just* her and *their* children are involved, it is one holiday, and one day of a four day weekend in which three other days exist for your family. His family has no days with him. That is in no way your fault or responsibility, but she and their kids are a connection to him as they are to the kids.\n\nOne holiday isn't too much to ask, tho you should be allowed to not go if you're not comfortable.", "YTA.  Suck it up for the children and your wife.  You and your new family will ALL benefit if the children have healthy relationships with their paternal grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.  Don\u2019t turn down extra sources of love and support for your wife and the children.", "NTA. You already proved that you care about her and her children by supporting her to remember her dear ex and also visited his family. But she should not force your anymore. You may not like the fact that you love someone who has someone else\u2019s place in her heart. She has to understand  and respect it.", "YTA this isn\u2019t just her late husband\u2019s family. This is her children\u2019s paternal family. Did you think you\u2019d step in and your family would be a substitute? It does not work that way. \n\nIt\u2019s one holiday a year for your stepchildren to spend with their dead father\u2019s family. She offered up every other holiday. If you didn\u2019t want a connection to that part of the family, you should not have married a widow with children.", "YTA - I understand it\u2019s not comfortable, but the kids. They\u2019re going to want to know about the dad they didn\u2019t get to know, yet the dad they do know is uncomfortable with it. You don\u2019t technically owe him or his parents any favors, but you are raising his kids. You\u2019re going to be their dad and do all the things that this other guy and his parents probably dreamed about. If you only see them one day a year, you can use that to learn one thing about this other guy, and you can tell the kids about it on a random day. He\u2019s not your competition, you and him are on the same team and if you can be a part of keeping his memory alive for those kids even if it\u2019s something small, that shrine is going to go away. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole with intent, but putting up a barrier because you feel threatened in a sense by a dead guy is a little immature. When you realize that you are filling the role that they thought they\u2019d be having a front row seat to and would probably want to spend everyday with those kids, like all of their friends get to do with their grandkids, and they only have one night. And I think if anything, seeing you interact with those kids would give them a lot more comfort than you not showing up. I don\u2019t know. I imagine being your wife and I\u2019d want them to know I was making good choices for the grandkids and if you showed up that would be a huge yes. I know you don\u2019t owe them that, but it just seems like this situation could be a lot more meaningful for you than anyone else to connect to the dad for your kids. It doesn\u2019t have to be awkward, what would you want him to do if roles were reversed and he was with your parents? The more you embrace him having a presence in your kids life, the more your wife is not going to need to make a presence for him in the closet shrine. I\u2019m sorry for writing a novel, happy thanksgiving.", "YTA. They are her family. They are her children\u2019s grandparents. This isn\u2019t a case of divorce where those familial ties are ended. Consider it like visiting her aunt or cousin. You should be supporting the children\u2019s connection to their dead father - not pouting like a child.", "NTA. If she wasn't ready to move on, she shouldn't have gotten into another relationship. I understand remembering her ex, especially for her sons, but she also needs to live more in the present and less in the past.", "NAH.  I can see how that would be really awkward and you don't want to go.  It's great that you encourage her and the kids to go and your wife shouldn't pressure you about it.", "NAH. Yes it's a different scenario but they will forever be the children's grandparents. If this is literally the only day of the year you see them I get how awkward it must feel but again remember... grandparents.", "NAH her pledge was made as a single woman. Life changed mean that things change. I would never ask someone to stop loving someone because of the misfortune of death. But, hold on to the past so tightly that you can't move forward with your life and loved ones isn't right.\nPerhaps she can change Thanksgiving celebration for the weekend before or after every other year or so.", "NTA. She sounds like she wasn't ready to move on with her life, honestly. If going there for Thanksgiving is a situation where she feels she needs your support to get through, why is she so determined to stick herself into it? Why would she not just celebrate the holiday in a way that doesn't require extra emotional support? Regardless, you have the right to be comfortable on *your* holidays; you're not demanding that she stop going over there & accompany you instead.", "NTA a fair compromise is alternating where you go each year, or just her and her sons going. You never getting to celebrate Thanksgiving with your family again because she isn\u2019t over her former husband is not fair.", "NTA that's just creepy and honestly emotionally abusive.\n\nShe has a *shrine* to her late husband in your home?\n\nEh sorry, that's really fucked up. I don't know how can be with someone who loves someone else, but don't let manipulate you into going to her ex husbands family home that's really really messed up.\n\nShe in therapy?", "NTA because you're fine doing your own thing and aren't forcing her to choose.   \n  \nDo they see their father's family other times of the year? If this is the only _holiday_ they get, that's nice I think, but they should be seeing them regularly.  \n  \nDo you have a plan regarding the future though if you have more kids? If that's a thing, because what then?  \n  \nAs someone with little family connection, the ideal I'd see is if you could host everyone but yeah.", "YTA - I would think your wife was the asshole if her ex chose to be out of your kids lives or was trying to stay in your wife\u2019s life, but that\u2019s not what this dinner is about, and when you chose to marry your wife you chose to also be a father. You can\u2019t choose one without the other in this situation, you\u2019re the only one they\u2019re going to have now. But you seem to me making this decision as a husband, and you should be making it as a husband _and_ father. Do you want your kids to _move forward_ from their grandparents or do you want your wife to move forward from her ex? This dinner isn\u2019t for your wife, it\u2019s for your kids.", "NTA She pledged it for herself and the kids -she had no right to do that on your behalf. The only compromise is to choose one the big events that she and the kids can go to the grandparents house without you. Maybe switch it to 4th of July, or maybe they can go more regularly and not have it on a big holiday. But you never need to be there\n\nAnd to be honest she doesnt either, only the kids deserve being with them. Your wife has to see that she has moved on.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
