Apparently she's gone to their house for Thanksgiving since her first husband died. I support this as it's a way for her to stay connected to her first husband's family and also since it's a way for her two kids to maintain a relationship with their father's side of the family.\n\nSo, I went last year. It was a little uncomfortable, but her late husband's family treated me really well. They were very kind and welcoming to me. It wasn't a bad Thanksgiving, but it was still really awkward and I felt very out of place.\n\nThis year my wife is trying to get me to go back, but I just want to go have Thanksgiving with my own family. I've invited her along but also told her that I understand if she doesn't want to go, but that we should be moving forward. But if she doesn't want to fine, but that she shouldn't try to make me go to Thanksgiving at her late husband's family's home. She's responded that we can have Christmas, Easter, the Fourth of July, etc with either her family or my family but that she's pledged Thanksgiving to her late husband's family and that I should come with her as her husband to support her.

They\u2019re going to want to know about the dad they didn\u2019t get to know, yet the dad they do know is uncomfortable with it. You don\u2019t technically owe him or his parents any favors, but you are raising his kids. You\u2019re going to be their dad and do all the things that this other guy and his parents probably dreamed about. If you only see them one day a year, you can use that to learn one thing about this other guy, and you can tell the kids about it on a random day.

And I think if anything, seeing you interact with those kids would give them a lot more comfort than you not showing up. I don\u2019t know. I imagine being your wife and I\u2019d want them to know I was making good choices for the grandkids and if you showed up that would be a huge yes. I know you don\u2019t owe them that, but it just seems like this situation could be a lot more meaningful for you than anyone else to connect to the dad for your kids. It doesn\u2019t have to be awkward, what would you want him to do if roles were reversed and he was with your parents? The more you embrace him having a presence in your kids life, the more your wife is not going to need to make a presence for him in the closet shrine.

If she wasn't ready to move on, she shouldn't have gotten into another relationship. I understand remembering her ex, especially for her sons, but she also needs to live more in the present and less in the past.", "NAH.  I can see how that would be really awkward and you don't want to go.  It's great that you encourage her and the kids to go and your wife shouldn't pressure you about it.", "NAH. Yes it's a different scenario but they will forever be the children's grandparents. If this is literally the only day of the year you see them I get how awkward it must feel but again remember... grandparents.", "NAH her pledge was made as a single woman. Life changed mean that things change. I would never ask someone to stop loving someone because of the misfortune of death. But, hold on to the past so tightly that you can't move forward with your life and loved ones isn't right.\nPerhaps she can change Thanksgiving celebration for the weekend before or after every other year or so.", "NTA. She sounds like she wasn't ready to move on with her life, honestly. If going there for Thanksgiving is a situation where she feels she needs your support to get through, why is she so determined to stick herself into it? Why would she not just celebrate the holiday in a way that doesn't require extra emotional support? Regardless, you have the right to be comfortable on *your* holidays; you're not demanding that she stop going over there & accompany you instead.", "NTA a fair compromise is alternating where you go each year, or just her and her sons going. You never getting to celebrate Thanksgiving with your family again because she isn\u2019t over her former husband is not fair.", "NTA that's just creepy and honestly emotionally abusive.\n\nShe has a *shrine* to her late husband in your home?\n\nEh sorry, that's really fucked up. I don't know how can be with someone who loves someone else, but don't let manipulate you into going to her ex husbands family home that's really really messed up.\n\nShe in therapy?", "NTA because you're fine doing your own thing and aren't forcing her to choose.   \n  \nDo they see their father's family other times of the year?

If that's a thing, because what then?  \n  \nAs someone with little family connection, the ideal I'd see is if you could host everyone but yeah.", "YTA - I would think your wife was the asshole if her ex chose to be out of your kids lives or was trying to stay in your wife\u2019s life, but that\u2019s not what this dinner is about, and when you chose to marry your wife you chose to also be a father. You can\u2019t choose one without the other in this situation, you\u2019re the only one they\u2019re going to have now. But you seem to me making this decision as a husband, and you should be making it as a husband _and_ father. Do you want your kids to _move forward_ from their grandparents or do you want your wife to move forward from her ex? This dinner isn\u2019t for your wife, it\u2019s for your kids.", "NTA She pledged it for herself and the kids -she had no right to do that on your behalf. The only compromise is to choose one the big events that she and the kids can go to the grandparents house without you. Maybe switch it to 4th of July, or maybe they can go more regularly and not have it on a big holiday.

I am someone who has been in this very situation. My husband died when my kids were very young (4yrs old and 4 months old). I remarried a few years later. I always referred to my first husband's family as the kids granny, the kids uncle, etc. There were times we would take the kids to their granny's house for Thanksgiving and we would go his family's or my family's. We just did something different each year. My current husband actually really likes the kids granny and aunt/uncle etc. There's never been any tension there at all. We have on occasion, had a meal together. But if OPs husband is uncomfortable he shouldn't be expected to attend. \n\nAnother thing I think about this post is that his wife shouldn't have a \"shrine to her late husband\" in their house. Listen, nobody ever loved a man more than I loved and still love my first husband. I thought I would grow old with him and we were the other half of each other's hearts. But I also love my current husband and I don't think, even though he is well aware of how I feel and is completely understanding of the situation, that it's fair to him to have something like that in the home he and I live in together. Instead, what I did was, put a picture of their dad in each of my kids rooms. Its a matter of respect for the person who has taken on the role of helping you raise and love and provide for your children. I wish them the best.", "I think this is a great sentiment. I completely understand why she would want to go to Thanksgiving with them, allowing her children a chance to be around their grandparents and allow her to be around people that she sees as family.

I think it\u2019s just one of those things that might be split for the holidays, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.", "Yep. I can only imagine how hard it is to be the second spouse of a widower and all the complicated feelings that accompany that, but I really hope OP can see how unsustainable this \"its time to move on\" mindset is. Whether he realizes it or not, these people are permanent fixtures of his family now. Not only do his children obviously love their grandparents, but it's very likely that his wife sees them as loved ones as well. If OP can't make peace with that then this relationship has an expiration date.", "This is a very good way of looking at it. I never even thought of that until you mentioned it.", "Well there's a small caveat that most of the replies have missed, the tradition of going there exclusively for Thanksgiving came _*after*_ the first husband died, it wasn't established beforehand. The tradition came from a place of grief and wasn't something that was established before his death, so going there seems more like a somber reminder of his death, or some sort of guilt for not going there more often when he was alive rather than a reminder of his life, so I can see why this might be a problem for OP. That would certainly be a rather uncomfortable position to be in.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, having one holiday earmarked for just one family isn't a compromise, it's actually rather unfair. What if his family decides to have other holidays elsewhere that precludes OP from being able to see them with his family in town? What if he has multiple siblings and it's the only time of year they get together that year? Does he have to wait an entire year to see his whole family again? That seems blatantly unfair. They children's grandparents could be invited to her parents house as a straight compromise, or even, if it's not too awkward, to his parents house, that way they can see the grandkids, and he's not on the defensive being somewhere he feels uncomfortable.\n\nThere's also the quote on quote shrine in the house, which I think this post, as others have pointed out, is more about his wife not being able to fully move on from her first husband's death, which is understandable, but she should never have gotten into a relationship let alone remarried if she wasn't completely at peace with his passing. This leads me to think that beyond the shrine and exclusive Thanksgiving demand, he may be compared a lot to the first husband, so that also may explain some of his responses, and would also shed some light on referring to them as _her former in-laws_ and _first husband's family_.", "I disagree about Op not being an AH in this. He married his wife and this is now his family also. He says that he accepts her love for her late husband,  then says they need to move forward from seeing the grandparents  because  it's \"weird and morbid\". \n\nKeeping in contact with people who love you is not weird and morbid.

If he doesn\u2019t want to go that\u2019s fine, but arguing about what\u2019s fair seems childish and something I did as a kid.", "Oh absolutely that should end if all children aren\u2019t treated well.", "This!!! He said that she and the kids can go but he wanted to see his family. I think that's reasonable", "For ONE holiday per year. She named three others off the top of her head that they would rotate between his and her family, including the other big one in four weeks. Blending families means compromise, and this seems to be the only concession she wants.", "And *he's tried,* he's gone before. If he hadn't at least tried *and* had tried to stop them from going? Different story.", "Lots of cultures have shrines dedicated to the deceased, so I don't think it's that weird at all tbh", "This is so true.", "I\u2019m just curious about what support she needs? If she\u2019s gotten past her late husband enough to remarry than I assume she\u2019s probably ok to be around his family by herself like she had been before she married OP. I think feeling like he\u2019s infringing on someone else\u2019s space during a holiday is an ok feeling to have and I\u2019m not sure I can blame him for not wanting to feel it when he can be with his family instead. Blended families don\u2019t always get to go by the \u201cnormal\u201d and that\u2019s just something to learn to live with.", "But she's not offering any concessions. She's making a demand, he offered a comprimise, she said no, only my way.", "ONE holiday that happens to be the most \"family\" centered of them all. He wants to spend it with his parents. Why not spend 4th of july with the dead husbands parents if it being \"one holiday\" is all that matters.", "Very uncomfortable to sit through several hours of conversation that new husband has nothing he can really contribute to or participate in when it will (and not really surprising) be centered around events he has no knowledge of.  Not fair to ask him to deal with.", "I think he said that cus the woman has a shrine in the house which is weird\u2026", "There's a difference between \"It's weird and morbid for her to want to continue seeing her late husband's family\" and \"It's weird and morbid for her new husband to go to her late husband's family's holidays\"\n\nHe's not saying that it's weird for her to go, it's weird for HIM to go. Which is a valid feeling.", "I don't think it's a matter of support as much as it is that connection and safety she feels with her former in-laws. It's awesome she has a good relationship with them and maybe she really became closer with them after her late husband's passing. \nAlso when you remarry its not a \"getting past things\" or \"getting over things\" you just get to a point where you allow another person into your life.\nI do agree with you though that blending families does change the whole dynamic. Therefore, op and his wife should absolutely sit down and discuss this openly. Like maybe why Thanksgiving is so important to be spent with former in-laws? That's a piece of information we don't have. I do believe there should be a sharing of time with family, and if distance is a factor that can be hard to do multiple visits on one day.", "It has to be hard for her to see her kids celebrating a holiday without their father. Just because she takes them there every year doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s ok. She\u2019s doing what is in the best interest of her children and not punishing her deceased husband\u2019s family because he had to go and die.", "Right? I would feel like I was intruding and that wasn't my place. Doesn't matters If the family is welcoming. Also, the grandparents are realy ok with him being there or they feel pressured and think it's the only way to have their grandchildren there?", "Exactly, I don't see the problem with him not going when he's already tried once for his wife and step-kids and though he *does* have issues with it, he's not being an A H about it by trying to stop them going. He's allowed his feelings.", "The \u201cpast father\u201d I\u2019m sorry what???", "He isn't their father- he's their stepfather.", " He thinks his wife needs to move on. What does that mean, in your mind? What is the reasonable way to read telling a woman that she and her kids need to move on from their living family members?", "The moving forward  part i think he said that cus she has a shrine in the house ..which is weird", "She isnt asking, she pledge thanksgiving to her late husband family maybe before getting married with  op, so he doesnt have a say?. And some say that their are his children grandparents and then other people say that their are not his children, son people cant decide wich one is? I think NAH is very apropiate in this case, except for his comment of moving foward, clearly his wife is moving foward at her own pace.", "Point or just sensationalism?", "Thanks for the insight /s", "She is acting weird and morbid. She has a shrine to her deceased husband in their house. That is weird and morbid. That needs to stop."]}
