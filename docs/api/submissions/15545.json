One of my classes went on a trip that cost $900 so I stopped going to the bank while I paid for the trip and it just became a habit so most of my money has just been sitting in my room on my desk.\n\nFriday afternoon I went to grab some money to repay one of my brothers for something he bought. There was only around $150 left. I know for a fact that after the trip I had about 600-700. I counted it before and after I left.\n\nSomeone obviously stole the money. I started searching around my room to see if anything else had been taken. Nothing, it was just the money. The money was basically in plain sight, which wasn't the smartest idea but I never thought my siblings would steal it so it wasn't a problem. I asked family if they knew anything about it. They didn't. A few hours later, two of them tell me they think it was the youngest, I'll call him Caleb. Caleb is 14, he obviously doesn't have a job right now. He worked at a haunted house for about a month and a half for $10 a day and he only worked 3-4 days a week. It wasn't that much in total. When he finally got paid, he spent all the money within a week or two.\n\nYesterday, after talking to my other brothers, we decided to do something about our suspicions and searched his room. He found $217 in Caleb's jacket pocket. The money was obviously mine because there's no way he would have gotten that much cash. We waited for our dad to get home to talk to him about it.\n\nMy dad instantly confronted him about it and Caleb obviously tried denying it at first saying that he just found it. My dad mentioned we found 217, he broke, admitting to stealing it from me. He can't pay me back for what he's already spent so my dad thinks that he should just pay me back with chores. I'm kind of mad that not much is being done about this other than him getting a few extra chores. My parents just don't seem to care.\nThat money was my college money and I really need it since I leave for college in a few months.\n\nMy friends are saying go to the police about it. My coworkers are saying that chores aren't enough to pay me back or learn the lesson that stealing isn't okay. He's stolen from people before but he never learns from it.\nI think more should be done about this but my parents think that I'm going overboard and that just doing my chores is enough. They're acting like I'm crazy for wanting my brother to actually get in trouble for this but maybe I'm just overly mad because it was my money.", "created_utc": 1682296091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wwawf/aita_for_wanting_more_to_be_done_about_my_brother/", "score": 680, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's your money and you left it in your house, thinking it was safe. Now, people are gonna yell at me for suggesting this but, does Caleb own a console or anything expensive that you could sell to get your money back?

Then the thief would have to work to pay ME back.

So a games console, mobile phone, anything you know he will be upset about missing. Will both reimburse you and teach him a lesson, win-win. I'm the youngest of four siblings and I've been on both sides of this, not to the extent or amount you have been hit for, but extra chores never phased me, but having my brand new video game taken and sold to reimburse my brother pissed me off to no end, but I learnt my lesson.", "NTA.

How does the younger sibling doing OP's share of chores when OP is so close to leaving the home rectify anything?\n\nThe other reason, and this is a biggie - people who steal and have no consequences are just going to repeat it.

Sucks you have to but\u2026", "NTA. Chores are not enough, they need to actually pay you back", "NTA Chores are a silly way for him to repay the debt, whether that\u2019s to you, or to repay your parents for making you whole for his transgression.The problem with making chores a punishment is that it creates a negative correlation with them. This is part of the reason why so many people hate doing chores because they grew up seeing them as a punishment. Also, the chances that they would actually make him do enough chores to repay the debt in either situation is slim. He\u2019d probably get off Scott free after a week and a few chores.\n\nAs for how to rectify the situation, he should definitely face harsher consequences. First of all he should be made to get a job and pay you back pay check by pay check until you e recouped all the money stolen. If he refuses then yea march him down to the police station and be like \u201calright man, since you refused to do the right thing and pay me back, then i gotta file a police report.\u201d I guarantee he will 1. Start crying, and 2. Beg for you to let him pay you back instead. It\u2019ll show him the natural consequences of stealing.

Apparently your parents won't do anything about it, so", "Your brother is a kleptomaniac", "No, parents can pay OP the whole amount and he can pay the parents back.

One of my classes went on a trip that cost $900 so I stopped going to the bank while I paid for the trip and it just became a habit so most of my money has just been sitting in my room on my desk.Friday afternoon I went to grab some money to repay one of my brothers for something he bought. There was only around $150 left. I know for a fact that after the trip I had about 600-700. I counted it before and after I left.Someone obviously stole the money. I started searching around my room to see if anything else had been taken. Nothing, it was just the money. The money was basically in plain sight, which wasn't the smartest idea but I never thought my siblings would steal it so it wasn't a problem. I asked family if they knew anything about it. They didn't. A few hours later, two of them tell me they think it was the youngest, I'll call him Caleb. Caleb is 14, he obviously doesn't have a job right now. He worked at a haunted house for about a month and a half for $10 a day and he only worked 3-4 days a week. It wasn't that much in total. When he finally got paid, he spent all the money within a week or two.Yesterday, after talking to my other brothers, we decided to do something about our suspicions and searched his room. He found $217 in Caleb's jacket pocket. The money was obviously mine because there's no way he would have gotten that much cash. We waited for our dad to get home to talk to him about it.My dad instantly confronted him about it and Caleb obviously tried denying it at first saying that he just found it. My dad mentioned we found 217, he broke, admitting to stealing it from me. He can't pay me back for what he's already spent so my dad thinks that he should just pay me back with chores. I'm kind of mad that not much is being done about this other than him getting a few extra chores. My parents just don't seem to care. That money was my college money and I really need it since I leave for college in a few months.My friends are saying go to the police about it. My coworkers are saying that chores aren't enough to pay me back or learn the lesson that stealing isn't okay. He's stolen from people before but he never learns from it. I think more should be done about this but my parents think that I'm going overboard and that just doing my chores is enough. They're acting like I'm crazy for wanting my brother to actually get in trouble for this but maybe I'm just overly mad because it was my money.\n\nscrew that, if he has a console or something worth money, you pawn that thing.", "If he's got nothing to show for the money, and he's taking it to school,  then my guess is that he's spending it on drugs", "If he only steals money, no he isn\u2019t. As far as I know that\u2019s a mental illness giving people the compulsion to steal regardless of the actual use of the thing they are stealing.

That $200 needs to be made up to you somehow in a way you agree with, it's not enough that your brother is simply punished. In my estimation, bother could take on your chores for a determined amount of time that makes up for the $200, if that's agreeable. If not, your parents could give you the $200, and have him work off the debt with them. If money is tight, maybe they can look into returning the stuff he bought or selling some of his stuff to make up for it.\n\nWhile I don't blame you for being upset at the situation since you aren't being made whole, you also don't get to decide how your brother is punished, that's your parents job.

You are right, chores don\u2019t cut it.  Your concerns have been handwaved away, and that\u2019s probably the bigger betrayal - that your parents don\u2019t care about it enough to take it seriously.  In a few years he will probably steal from someone else, who will have no qualms about reporting him to the police and pressing charges.
