One of my classes went on a trip that cost $900 so I stopped going to the bank while I paid for the trip and it just became a habit so most of my money has just been sitting in my room on my desk.\n\nFriday afternoon I went to grab some money to repay one of my brothers for something he bought. There was only around $150 left. I know for a fact that after the trip I had about 600-700. I counted it before and after I left.\n\nSomeone obviously stole the money. I started searching around my room to see if anything else had been taken. Nothing, it was just the money. The money was basically in plain sight, which wasn't the smartest idea but I never thought my siblings would steal it so it wasn't a problem. I asked family if they knew anything about it. They didn't. A few hours later, two of them tell me they think it was the youngest, I'll call him Caleb. Caleb is 14, he obviously doesn't have a job right now. He worked at a haunted house for about a month and a half for $10 a day and he only worked 3-4 days a week. It wasn't that much in total. When he finally got paid, he spent all the money within a week or two.\n\nYesterday, after talking to my other brothers, we decided to do something about our suspicions and searched his room. He found $217 in Caleb's jacket pocket. The money was obviously mine because there's no way he would have gotten that much cash. We waited for our dad to get home to talk to him about it.\n\nMy dad instantly confronted him about it and Caleb obviously tried denying it at first saying that he just found it. My dad mentioned we found 217, he broke, admitting to stealing it from me. He can't pay me back for what he's already spent so my dad thinks that he should just pay me back with chores. I'm kind of mad that not much is being done about this other than him getting a few extra chores. My parents just don't seem to care.\nThat money was my college money and I really need it since I leave for college in a few months.\n\nMy friends are saying go to the police about it. My coworkers are saying that chores aren't enough to pay me back or learn the lesson that stealing isn't okay. He's stolen from people before but he never learns from it.\nI think more should be done about this but my parents think that I'm going overboard and that just doing my chores is enough. They're acting like I'm crazy for wanting my brother to actually get in trouble for this but maybe I'm just overly mad because it was my money.", "created_utc": 1682296091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wwawf/aita_for_wanting_more_to_be_done_about_my_brother/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With actual cash money. He can then pay *them* back with chores if that\u2019s what they think is appropriate.", "NTA \n\nYour parents should replace it. While you could go to the cops, it isn\u2019t going to help. Fact of the matter is, they\u2019re not gonna be able to do anything short of charging him\u2026.. which doesn\u2019t replace the money. \n\nBottom line, demand your parents replace the money.

He can go cut lawns or something.", "NTA\n\nIf your parents think chores are worth $200, why don\u2019t they pay you back in cash and just have Caleb do chores for them?", "NTA\n\nI don't understand your dad. Is Caleb doing your chores? Is he going to do your laundry? Shine your shoes? Wipe your fanny after a poo? How in the hell is CHORES a punishment that does right by you? Your dad is a quack.\n\nPolice is one option, but give your dad a chance to correct his mistake.", "NTA, 14 is old enough to know that stealing is wrong. He should have to pay you back when he gets a job, in addition to your chores.\n\nThat said, going to the police is a bad idea. Best case scenario, they don\u2019t do anything; worst case scenario, they create trouble that\u2019s way out of proportion for your brother and family by extension", "NTA\n\nIf your parents are so sure that chores are punishment enough,  they should pay you back what he stole and make him work off the debt to *them*.  They should also pay for getting a lock installed on your bedroom door because , while leaving cash on your desk wasn't very clever,  you shouldn't have to worry about hiding your valuables every time you leave your house. \n\nYou might also want to invest in a \"nanny cam\" for your room so you can know who's entering your room and what they're doing.", "NTA, but you shouldn't go to the police, you'll only regret that and you'll get nothing in return. Speaking in legal terms, in these cases I'm pretty sure the guardians are the ones that have to take responsibility for the crime. So I'd say, tell your parents to pay you back. It's your money and you left it in your house, thinking it was safe. Now, people are gonna yell at me for suggesting this but, does Caleb own a console or anything expensive that you could sell to get your money back? I wouldn't actually go through with it, but maybe hiding it and pretending that you did it just to teach him a lesson-- and get a proper response from your parents to use as leverage, that could be the way to go.", "NTA. If you are prepared for intense conflict and potentially having to move out (depending on how old you are and how your parents respond), I would file a police report. Even if you don\u2019t intend on pressing charges, let him have the stress of knowing there\u2019s a police report, knowing it\u2019s that serious and knowing id he\u2019s caught again he could get in more trouble. Where I live, stuff like that gets cleared from your record when you turn 18, but he doesn\u2019t need to know that. Also, are your parents aware of his history stealing? Any idea as to why they don\u2019t see an issue with it? Or atleast why they would think chores would stop him from doing it again? Like, yeah you got some of it back. He still got all the benefits of all that free money. Him doing chores, even if they\u2019re your chores he\u2019s taking off of you for a while, does not replenish a POST SECONDARY FUND. Your parents should really be reimbursing you considering it\u2019s your post secondary fund!!", "NTA. My son stole money from my daughter in similar circumstances. He was punished. I replaced the money. He learned his lesson. She moved back home and leaves money openly in her room now with no issues. He lives at home as well still.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should call the police, but you should tell him you are not doing so only because he\u2019s your brother. Tell him if it happens again, you will report him.", "NTA if chores can cover the price, then your parents can pay him to do chores and give the money to you. Bet you they will see it more seriously then! Also tell them if they don't take it more seriously perhaps the police will for petty theft", "NTA your parents don't seem to care if they haven't  done much about him stealing from other people... they wont be able to ask a judge to let him do chores when he steals from the wrong person... if u have somewhere to go until ubleave for age go file a police report... otherwise he will never learn.. long as u are at your parents keep all valuables and money locked away... get a safe if u have to...", "His stealing isn't going to stop someone has to show him consequences of his actions... u should be the one", "NTA let your parent know you don\u2019t want chores you want cash and if it\u2019s not returned by such and such  you will Call the police.. don\u2019t let them guilt you out of it.and honestly wtf a chore going to do for you? You need cash to get anywhere in life not chores.. wtf!! and get back in the habit of putting your money in the bank.. Caleb knows right from wrong he needs to be held responsible for his thievery. Your parents can repay his debt and get \u201cchores\u201dout of him in return\u2026And put a lock on your door..", "NTA - your parents should pay you back & then have your brother do the stupid chores. This is very unfair but it isn't worth going to the police over. You should get a lockbox to prevent this from happening again. It it horrible & unfair, I would just think filing a police report is way too much trouble for no different outcome. You still won't get your money back", "NTA. \n\nTalk to the police, because nothing else is working.", "NTA - depending on what he spent the other money on I would demand that my parents allow me to take those items and either return/sell them for the money.  Then, if your parents could afford it, I would cover the rest and make Caleb pay them (your parents back) when he gets a job (eventually).", "NTA \n\nThe problem is that he might have to do your chores, but you're still out the $183. Ask your parents how you are going to get that money [that you need for college] back? Their plan is not fair to you. He needs to mow lawns, walk dogs,  etc. and give all the money to you until he's paid you back.", "NTA.\nUltimatum: parents can pay you back and little brother can do chores to pay them back OR you go to the police. If this were his first offense, I would say, maybe that is too extreme, but clearly he has a problem with stealing, and no one is doing anything about it. He\u2019s on a path to much worse things if he doesn\u2019t get it under control.", "NTA. I'm a mom of 2 kids - 17 and 11. If one of them stole from the other, then I would cover the amount stolen. Then the thief would have to work to pay ME back. I would also, quite likely, ground the thief until the money was paid off. \n\nGiven that your brother is a minor, and the small amount of money, involving the police probably won't result in any disciplinary action. If your brother were 18, I would absolutely say, based on personal experience, to call the police. My sister stole my identity. I didn't involve the police because our mom begged me not to... long story short, she stole more from me later.", "Police report!!\n\nDo it now before he gets caught as an adult and is in \"real\" trouble.\n\nYour parents will be pissed, and they'll have to deal with it and lose time doing it. But if they don't take it seriously, someone should q", "ESH!  You are aware your brother has a history of stealing yet you continuously leave large amounts of cash laying out very openly.
