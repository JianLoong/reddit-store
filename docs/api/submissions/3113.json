When I was a child he was a lot of fun. My parents separated when I was 5, and my older brother (now 35M) and I would spend two days a week with him, never any nights. He would create scavenger hunts, take us to Blockbuster, theme parks, buffet dinners, shopping for our favourite toys, allowed us to always include our friends.. childhood with him was fairly exciting and positive, until we would go home and him and my mother would fight and he would say the most awful things. As I grew older I hated the way he treated my Mom, my stepmom, my aunt, my grandma, and me\u2014 he did not treat women with respect and was a master gaslighter.\n\nIt was rough as I hit my teenage years. He was very mentally abusive, controlling, and he would constantly tell me I couldn\u2019t have a boyfriend. He told me he would take me to the doctors to get my hymen checked and that if I was a virgin by the time I was 21 he would buy me a car. He became very interested if my friends were virgins, telling me he knew which ones weren\u2019t or would flat out ask them if they are having sex and want to talk about it. I knew this was very inappropriate and it made me feel sick to my stomach. I stopped bringing my friends around, and my relationship with my Dad became more distant. \n\nAs an adult I know he has narcissistic personality disorder. \n\nMy father harasses me every few months via phone and text begging me to have a relationship ship. His favourite line \u201cwhat have I ever done to you to deserve this?\u201d. I have told him many times in point form, if he scrolled up in our text convo he would see the same points listed multiple times. Maybe he deletes the convos? Anyways, it\u2019s exhausted and I\u2019ve just stopped replying. \n\nFor my brothers birthday this year he asked if he could take us all out for dinner. I said yes, for my brother. He then told us that he was going to bring a friend and mentioned her name. After some social media sleuthing I found out he was dating a girl who JUST turned 21 years old. This BROKE me, I was DONE! I told him he is disgusting and that I have always known he was a predator. My brother agrees that it is wrong and doesn\u2019t want her to attend his birthday, but he doesn\u2019t feel as strong about this situation. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since this happened. Christmas is approaching and I have the biggest house of my family members. I have volunteered to host, but said I will not be including our Dad. My brother is pissed and said that him and his family will not be attending. I asked him why he is choosing a man who can\u2019t even remember our kids\u2019 birthdays? He says despite everything he is still our father and he should be included, and that him and the 21 year old have broken up.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m not going to budge.. but am I being an asshole?", "created_utc": 1669253805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z36t1d/aita_for_not_including_my_dad58_in_xmas_because/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m willing to bet that your dad had a slightly different relationship with your brother, specifically that he was more lenient on him as a guy. Also, in my experience, siblings often have different relationships with parents and will have differing memories of parents. I think you should hold on to your boundaries and stick with your decision.", "No, you are absolutely NTA.  I think that's genuinely gross.  I do wonder about your own mental health given what you've detailed in your post about continuing contact, particularly with a narcissist.", "Bro you had me at the title but good god, you literally did nothing wrong, NTA. I'm genuinely pissed for you, cut this parasite off.", "NTA\u2026 i\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your house, your event, your hosting gig.

Asking teen girls about their virginity status??? Then dating someone who's only just turned 21? It's your house, you do not need to invite him especially when he's this creepy", "NTA", "Dear OP, you are NTA and you are not a bad daughter for doing this. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nThe part you wrote that \"He was very mentally abusive, controlling, and he would constantly tell me I couldn\u2019t have a boyfriend.

He became very interested if my friends were virgins, telling me he knew which ones weren\u2019t or would flat out ask them if they are having sex and want to talk about it.\" has left me feeling sad and angry for your younger self. A loving and respectful dad would never do such things to his daughter. What your dad did is unacceptable, predatory and misogynistic.\n\nYou go ahead and don't invite dad for the sake of your sanity and emotional health. Your house, your rules and you yourself get the right to decide who to invite to your place. If you invite him over, who knows what if he starts being a creep again towards one of your guests who is old enough to be his kid", "NTA\u2014 wow, this is uncannily similar to my good friend\u2019s situation. I think once someone becomes a predator in your mind there\u2019s not much hope of going back. He was creepy with you and your friends and that was abusive and scary, so I can see how this \u201cgirlfriend\u201d brought up all that and really made it clear this interest in your sexuality was not merely about keeping you safe. He might always be your dad and maybe you\u2019ll always love him in a way, but that doesn\u2019t mean you always have to see him even though he makes you feel really unsafe.", "NTA. Don't budge, your father is an abusive narcissist who is fucking someone who's barely legal. If your brother wants to spend Christmas with him, he can do so elsewhere.\n\nHis biological relation to you is irrelevant, who he is as a person is.

I think there is some emotional incest happening  especially when you consider his age preference. He was incredibly abusive and for that alone he should not be there. I was disgusted reading this. If he were a great father, and the girlfriends age were the only factor, I would say YTA but your father is a gross creep.", "Info: why do you still see this man at all?", "Yuuup, given that your relationship with your father was only poisoned when you looked and saw that he was disrespecting people who you were viewing as role models as a child, and then was not only sexualizing you and controlling your body, but sexualizing your friends, your brother has more than likely never seen your father's true dark side and cared.\n\nYour brother has never been abused by your dad like you because he's male. Don't let your brother tell you how it is because you're father never took him to medical appointments to Hyman check him. Lay that out clearly for your brother and tell him again what the boundaries are. If he doesn't like them, he should go elsewhere", "There is a lot I had to remove from the post in order for it to fit the character limit.

I can not let this slide. The whole argument of \u201cbut they\u2019re broken up now\u201d doesn\u2019t matter.. he already did it. He can never take it back, and this was the straw that broke me.", "My brother got to see his sides, he got things worse than me because he moved in with our Dad when he was a teenager. My brother lost all self esteem and had a serious case of learned helplessness due to his upbringing. He\u2019s doing better, but he has been brain washed into his loyalty. It\u2019s sad, really.", "I'm really glad to hear that.  But, as someone with a narcissistic parent, I understand it's not always avoidable.  I'm glad you're not sacrificing your well being.", "I\u2019m glad you felt safe to share here. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not going to budge.", "You are welcome, OP. You did mention that 21-year-old broke up with him right? Be glad that 21-year-old broke up him and I suspect she saw him for the gross predator he is or someone intervened and told her he is bad news for her. \n\nI am not gonna mince my words and not trying to be disrespectful about your dad: your dad seriously needs help and his narcissistic personality disorder will sooner or later land him in trouble or worse he ends up meeting his match that is not afraid to put him in his place\n\nNo, you are not punishing him. You are protecting yourself and possibly other party guests your dad might start creeping on \ud83e\udd22.", "Covid gave me the best excuse to cut contact. It\u2019s been amazing.
