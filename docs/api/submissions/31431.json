She'll get married a month earlier.  **And in the same venue**.  That's rather petty.  \n\n2)  You aren't making the \"It's MY SPECIAL DAY!\" argument.

I doubt her boyfriend is aware that he\u2019s \u201cdefinitely\u201d getting married in September 2025. It sounds like she made it up on the spur of the moment. That said, you can\u2019t place an embargo on any weddings happening in the 3 months before your wedding. Is it ideal? No, of course not. But it\u2019s not up to you.

SIL has nothing planned. Say nothing to anyone about your save the date attack. This way, SIL will look silly to try to plan a wedding a month before. \n\nAlso, please inquire about how to make deposits refundable moving forward. Anything can happen in two years, and a partial refund is better than no refund.", "Don't tell her anything about your wedding and plans you've made, just incase she tries to use all your plans, dress, venues, caterers and the like.
