Those two people are not your real friends - particularly the one spewing nonsense that \"real friends lean on others in times of hardship instead of isolating themselves.\"  Everyone is different and every situation is different and in EACH CASE YOU decide how to deal with things.

It should never have been an issue for you to go radio-silent for a few days. Giving a heads-up in a group convo is a good courtesy, but really, daily check-ins? What? \n\nOne of the things that I have found after my mom's passing is that I really have lost tolerance for bullshit. If your friends make you feel bad on the regular, they're not friends.

It's supposed to be a give-and-take, not givegivegive. And when it comes time to lean on friends, it's as much on the friends to say \"hey, lean on me, let me help\" as to just expect you to speak up. You were trying for far too long to hold it all together, and it sounds like your \"friends\" weren't doing their part AT ALL. Who was checking in on you? Who was asking you if they could do this or that to help you? \n\nYou do not need to apologize, and please do not. If you can cut those friends who made the snide remarks, do it.

Your friends know what is happening, you communicated that clearly it seems. \n\nIt\u2019s important to have multiple friends you can turn to for emotional support & not just one (You) in case of moments like this. You were isolating for a couple days, not weeks or months. Your snide comment friends need to be the ones attempting to provide emotional support, not applying pressure & judgement for how you choose to emotionally support yourself.", "How exhausting that you're not allowed to just live your life without having to make sure your friends don't get upset with you.
