It's taken a lot of therapy to realize that I shouldn't have ignored all the signs that I was struggling.

Distance yourself from the \"friends\" who can't handle not having you 24/7. Open up more to the friends who are understanding and ask them if it's okay for you to pull back more.

They're emotional vampires who use you for their own needs.\n\n*None* of my friends would react in that way. If I sent the message you sent, they would all respond \"absolutely understand, let me know if you need anything, hope you feel better soon\".\n\nAs far as the constant stress and demands of messaging, please learn to set limits for yourself with which you are comfortable. ***No one*** **is entitled to your instant attention, ever** (the exceptions being a partner or a child). One of my siblings handled this by reading and responding only to messages from their partner and their children during the day, and having a set time in the evening to read and respond to everyone else. \n\nFigure out what works for you; anyone who gets upset at those boundaries isn't really your friend, anyway.", "There\u2019s a concept related to grief that doesn\u2019t get talked about often called Secondary Loss.\n\nGrief changes who you are and how you relate to the world, and sometimes the people you were in relationships with before the losses happened aren\u2019t able to adjust to the new person you\u2019re becoming. My dad died when my siblings and I were teenagers, and each of us lost at least one friend during the first year after his death. Almost everyone I know who\u2019s experienced a loss like that has a Secondary Loss story. \n\nIt\u2019s not that your friends are bad people. They can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re dealing with and they don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t just \u201cgo back to normal.\u201d It may be that you\u2019re just not the right people for each other to be friends with right now. \n\nIt sucks all around, and I\u2019m so sorry, for the loss of your family members and the potential end to friendships you valued. I wish none of this had happened to you.", "I'm soo sorry that happened to you. I couldn't imagine feeling like you're alone for something like that. I'm glad your airport strangers were there for you.\n\nWhen I lost my mom I was 14 and it was my maternal grandma who told me and my brother. They both broke and I did for a moment, before the sight of my bro loosing it kick on my mom's bear mode and I shut it all off to take care of him, them honestly because grandma was really hurting too.\n\nI know I didn't process my grief properly, or at all, and my mental health collapse didn't happen for about a decade after that. Some people last for a long time pouring from that empty cup, especially those who didn't have anyone to teach them it needed to be filled, but everyone has a breaking point.", "NTA. Real friends would understand. Those two are leeches. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for everything you've been going through. It sounds like you've had a rough time lately. I think your 2 friends are being self centered inconsiderate jerks. \n\n\"Real friends\" would understand that everyone handles things differently. A true friend could have sent you a message that said something like, \"I respect your need for space, but I wanted you to know that I'm thinking about you and I'm here if you need anything.\" And then followed through by respecting your needs.", "NTA. I really don't get the part about having to see and text your friends every day. Believe me, I have a couple of very dear close friends of more than 30 years around me and only text/see or call some of them once every two months. I can't imagine constant texting and hangouts.
