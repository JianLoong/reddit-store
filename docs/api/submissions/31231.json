Last year after Thanksgiving, several family members expressed interest in doing a larger gathering next year. My husband and I agreed and offered to host everyone (parents-in-law and two sisters-in-law and their partners/kids) at our home. Everyone was on board and we went ahead through the year fully prepared and excited to host. We checked in with everyone several times in the months leading up to make sure they were still on board and to work out who would bring what. \n\nCut to about a week ago: my sister-in-law calls my husband out of the blue to *inform* him that Thanksgiving would be moving to their mom's (my mother-in-law) house because she said it's more centrally located, has more room, and because her three children (ages 16, 20, and 22) don't want to drive \"all the way\" out to our house...10 miles away. Then, she told him that we are \"welcome to come.\" \n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it takes approximately 15 minutes to drive from their town to ours. Also, our house is actually twice the size of my mother-in-law's house. We didn't buy a turkey because my sister-in-law said she had one she could bring. \n\nMy husband was very hurt by this decision and doesn't want to go to his mom's house for Thanksgiving. I'm hurt, too, as are our two children (12 and 18). We were all excited to host and are disappointed that there was an entire group conversation and decision made, and no one reached out to ask us if that would be ok before just making the decision. \n\nNone of us are in the mood to go to the family Thanksgiving now, and suspect that there's more to the story than what my sister-in-law is saying. None of us feel welcome at this point, and we let the rest of the family know that we would not be attending. \n\nAre we the assholes for not attending Thanksgiving because our feelings are hurt about the change in venue?", "created_utc": 1700334006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ydbvo/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_thanksgiving_after/", "score": 1934, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s such an odd flex.  I get why you are all hurt by all the behind the scenes maneuvering.  It\u2019s not about the change in venue.

Have you called your MIL to ask what\u2019s going on?", "I think your hubby should call his parents and ask why the venue was changed.  It seems odd and his sister seems selfish, or she's jealous you have such a nice home.  You're both NTA, stay home and away from sissy.", "NTA, it does sound like there is more going on.

It is possible, although not likely that the SIL is manipulating the situation and your MIL and FIL are innocent.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of who initiated it, a unilateral decision and then a call to inform you was a real dick move.

What reason could they possibly have for not including you in that decision? I wouldn't feel like going to their house either. I'd fix a nice dinner at my house, sit back with my family and relax.
