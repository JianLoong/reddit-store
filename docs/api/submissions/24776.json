When the last girl came she came with her father because he wanted to help her settle down here and he wanted to stay for one night and leave the next day. No one had any problem with that however, S has a single bed in her room. So she asked me if she can sleep with me in my double bed and her dad can sleep in the single. I refused because I don't like to share my bed, especially with someone I just met. \n\nShe tells me she just wants her dad to get a good night's sleep and the couch is not very comfortable. I told her that that's one of the reasons I chose to take the bigger room because I might have family over. She decided to take the cheapest and smallest room and that's not my fault. I told her to ask the other flatmate who also has a double bed but S didn't want to do that because S and I are from the same country the other girl is not.\n\nSo yeah, I hate that I messed things up already and wanted to ask Reddits opinion AITA?", "created_utc": 1692176833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15skkf6/aita_for_refusing_to_share_my_room_with_my/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Otherwise, find an Airbnb.", "NTA.  She can ask, but one you say \"no,\" that's it.  Just say \"I'm sorry to hear that -- it's important for me to get a good night's sleep, too.\"  Btw, it's nice of you and the other roommate to let the girl's father stay overnight.

Not sure where you are from/if this would be considered normal but I would personally definitely not be ok sharing a bed with a stranger. You could offer to help set up the couch to be more comfy to be polite (extra pillows or something) but it\u2019s just one night, she will be fine on the couch. In the morning, just say something like \u201csorry if you felt I was impolite - it wasn\u2019t anything personal at all, you seem awesome, this is just not something that is normal for me and I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep sharing a bed with someone that I just met.\u201d", "NTA \n\nYour answer could have been a bit more tactful but better the boundaries are cheat right off the bat.\n\nShe's a stranger.... being from the same country didn't entitle you to a bed share.

It\u2019s also really creepy that a grown man would expect to sleep at his daughters dorm/uni flat. That is super weird, be ware of this roommate OP, she sounds like a very inconsiderate person who is about to take as mush as she can get away with.

Otherwise you'd be expected to do the same every time she had a family member/friend/whatever to stay - and why couldn't her dad get a hotel or B&B anyway?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would never share a bed with a stranger, and I would have figured something out before the move in date.", "NTA at all! That\u2019s so weird, I would not be comfy sleeping with a rando", "You didn\u2019t mess things up, you set a boundary early on, you will be glad you did. Their lack of planning is not your responsibility. Also, did she ask ahead of time if this strange man you never met can have access to your apartment?", "NTA\n\nShe can take the couch for one night, if her fathers sleep is so important...and just have a nap the next day.", "Nta. She can sleep on the couch if she doesn\u2019t want her dad to.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine to refuse. And: This after a few days? Start setting boundaries FAST.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA, sharing a bed with someone I don\u2019t know (and have to keep living with) sounds like a nightmare! \n\nAs a compromise you could\u2019ve offered her and her dad your bed for the night but you\u2019re not an asshole for not doing that either.", "NTA.\n\nI would never. She can buy a blow up mattress or dad can stay somewhere else. It seems really bizarre to me she would even ask the question. Is this something common where you're both from?\n\nEdit: Honestly in a girls apartment it seems a bit weird dad would stay over at all. Like what if y'all want to walk around less than fully dressed?", "NTA\n\nIt's no problem that she asked, but she needed to accept your 'no' the first time.  If she's so concerned that dad gets a good night's sleep in a private room (as a housemate I'd prefer he have a separate room than the couch too, if he was going to stay over *at all* which is still kinda weird here tbh), then *she* should sleep on the couch for one night.", "NTA. Tell her you have nightmares and wake up kicking and screaming. Or that you\u2019re a really sweaty sleeper. Or any other reasons. She\u2019s definitely the AH here but I would definitely lie to make my life a little easier in your situation", "NTA. She can sleep on the couch.", "NTA. LOL, you are strangers, and she wants to share a bed with you the very first time you meet? No, you did not mess up. The other girl needs to establish a better understanding of social boundaries.", ">It\u2019s also really creepy that a grown man would expect to sleep at his daughters dorm/uni flat.\n\nThat was my thought. That would need to be approved by everyone to begin with and still weird.", "Why would OP want strangers in her bed on any night? Nope.", "I mean as long as they brought their own bedding I wouldn\u2019t mind it, but to each their own and I don\u2019t blame op for not offering."]}
