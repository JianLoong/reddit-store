Yesterday was my Fianc\u00e9\u2019s birthday and I splurged and took her, her brother, and her friends out to eat at a very expensive and really nice restaurant downtown. The service and food was really great but it was very much not our type of scene because we obviously did not look like their *usual* clientele. After paying and tipping our host on the card we were making our exit from the restaurant when our host/waiter chased us down in front of the whole restaurant. He asked if there was a problem with his service. We said no it was fine and that we enjoyed his service. He then asked why we didn\u2019t tip. I told him that I did tip him on the card and pretty DECENT amount too. He loudly proclaimed we didn\u2019t and told us to \u201cHave a nice day\u201d in a very rude way. The whole restaurant stopped and stared at us as if we were the worst people in the world. I told our group to leave and as we were leaving I checked my bank statement and it definitely verified my claim that I tipped him. I went back inside under peaceful circumstances to explain to him that I tipped and showed him my bank statement and he looked like he was embarrassed by the fact he wrong and he continued to make a scene so I took it upon myself to embarrass him for being since he attempted to embarrass me and my group when he was in the wrong. Security then asked me to leave. I truly feel like he didn\u2019t deserve the tip after that debacle. WIBTA if I disputed the charge with my bank due to this experience?\n\nEdit 1: To clarify I plan on disputing just the Tip by conversing with my bank. Not the entire charge. Should\u2019ve been a bit more clear in that regard.\nEdit 2: Gonna call the manager first. Forgot that was an option.

Deduct the tip from the total. I would call and speak to a manager about what happened. This waiter is a detriment to the establishment, and his employers need to know.", "NTA - he was WAY out of line - you can try to dispute but if you signed the slip it may not work - I\u2019d say leave a few bad reviews online", "NTA if you only request the tip back, not the whole charge. I've heard of staff doing this to embarrass people when they haven't tipped, but you did. The minute you said you had tipped (with or without proof) it should have been dropped. And when you went back and proved it he should have been apologetic. Not sure you needed to go out of your way to embarrass him though. \n\nGotta admit, if I was embarrassed like that, and then basically called a liar, I'd want my tip back rather than the whole charge, though this is an opportunity to be the bigger man\n\nEdit: I thought OP just wanted the tip back rather than the whole meal cost.", "NTA I wish you could dispute the entire dinner charge for that kind of behavior\n\nI currently live off of tips and even I can tell you tipping is NOT mandatory there should be no reason to chase someone down to demand a bigger one.", "NTA and the guy in the restaurant would deserve that for being a cock.", "Absolutely nta . First off, a tip is NOT mandatory and requires no explanation unless you offer one up. Chasing you down to ask if you were unhappy with the service because of the tip is never okay and puts the customer in such an awkward and uncomfortable position. Also, I would dispute the tip because you hadnt left the restaurant yet and the waiter potentially ruined the rest of your night. You should also let the manager know and leave a review of this experience.", "NTA. I'd be real annoyed especially after the tip you left. How incredibly rude. And what a shame to represent yourself in that manner (the waiter). Definitely talk to the manager and dispute the tip if you have to.", "NTA totally deserves it!", "Is the charge for the meal separate from the charge for the tip on your account? I think you would be TA if you dispute the whole meal, but YWNBTA if you dispute the tip. I also think you should call the restaurant and speak with a manager about your experience.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the dispute will be successful though, since you did make the tip and sign the receipt.", "What\u2019s a \u201cdecent\u201d tip to you? \n\nWhat was your total check amount, and what did you leave him?", "A review would be the best thing you can do. You left over a 20% tip. I wouldn\u2019t call the bank but right a detail review on all the platform they are on", "NTA call the owner and describe the events. The manager needs to be held accountable for his assholish behaviour.", "Typicallt ips don't show up on a charge until the restaurant submits the settlement to the credit card company the next day", "YWNBTA. He tried to publicly embarrass you for not doing something you did. He doesn't deserve a tip now.", "NTA. I'd dispute the tip with my bank and leave a detailed review online. \n\nPart of me thinks the waiter did it on purpose in front of a crowd and knew you'd really left a good sized tip. That'll teach the peasants from thinking they can dine alongside the fashionable LA elite", "NTA I'd probably dispute the tip and never go back after talking to the manager. I remember going to a bar with my friend group at the time when we just turned 21 and after leaving $50 on a $100 tab the bouncers get in my face when we are almost out the door and saying we didn't pay. The server then gave them a thumbs up and they told us to get the fuck out. Absolutely crazy experience and being so novice/young at the time to the bar scene I wish I would have taken the tip back. We tipped so much because we were going to be going there all the time and thought it would show we gave a shit since most of us worked in the industry in the first place", "YWB.TA. Disputing the charge is not the way to deal with poor customer service. Plus, you signed the receipt. Though, I think you should absolutely leave a review and detail the experience.\n\nAfter your edit, NTA", "Hate to be that guy, but if you dispute a charge for a service you actually received you'll be committing fraud.  And the restaurant staff will be happy to tell your bank that not only did you receive said service, you told them before you left that you were happy with it.  If you really want to explain all that to a cop, go right ahead.\n\nLeave an honest review of the business.  Don't cut off your nose to spite your face.", "YWBTA if you dispute the charge.  You ate the meal, you got the service you paid for.  This should have been settled by the manager of the restaruant.  You shouldve asked to speak with them, tell them that the waiter embarrassed you by claiming you didnt tip him.  Show the manager your proof that you did, and tell the manager that his employees should not treat their guests like that.  Disputing charges is for when you get charged for something you didnt get or you didnt order. You got the food and the service", "This didn't happen.", "Sounds a lot like you left some shit out, honestly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Have the manager pull the slip, you had the bank info and let the manager take care of this staff person??    Yes, you could dispute the tip with the bank, but, why?  Because this person was a jerk?    You certainly thought they had earned the tip prior to that scene...     Up to you, but, at this point.   I won't say YTA, but, you are not letting it go either...   in my mind, that makes you on the level of that waiter...", "NTA I would also maybe leave a review.", "YWBTA for disputing the charge. That isn't the way to handle the situation. The server behaved inappropriately and contacting the owner or leaving a fair review would be warranted. \n\nThe food was consumed and the tip was valid/not fraud. You don't get to change your mind afterwards. Always exert your valid feelings about a situation like this in appropriate and measured ways if you can.", "I forgot that was an option. Will definitely call a manager first.", "That jerk was way out of line. HE ASSUMED you didn't tip because of the way you looked AND had the audacity to call you out publicly and embarrass you.

I didn\u2019t even realize you could do that, so looking back I can see what you mean.\n\nWith that being said, you should absolutely do both of those things.
