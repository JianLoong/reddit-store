I have gotten along with her family really well. I am white and she comes from a traditional patriarchal, Latin family with a very strict dad. They have always been very welcoming and I\u2019ve returned the same energy. However, she had an extremely difficult upbringing, primarily due to her father\u2019s verbal and emotional abuse. Mia has told me stories about her childhood and more recent incidents, it\u2019s clear this relationship impacts her mental health. While I have gotten frustrated with the way he treats her, I have supported her in the aftermath and never gotten directly involved. \r  \nA few weeks ago, Mia was graduating from her master\u2019s program. The plan was for her, both her parents, and I to take one car to the ceremony together. She had other family/friends attending and we were attempting to limit the number of cars going to campus as she attended a large university. We left expecting to get there with 1-1.5 hours to spare to get to the ceremony and find seating. Her dad was driving and I was in the passenger seat, with her and her mom in the back. As we got closer to the school, things got stressful and became a perfect storm (heavy traffic, all of the parking lots that were supposed to be open and free for graduation guests were closed, no available street parking, construction, multiple ceremonies on scheduled on the same day). Her father\u2019s temper escalated as we searched for parking and he began to berate my girlfriend. He raised his voice, called her stupid, and blamed her constantly. Mia was having a panic attack. We finally found parking but had to walk approximately 1mi to get to the ceremony. He injured his knee last year, and we all understood that the walk could be uncomfortable. He kept berating her on the same points and even brought up leaving without going to the ceremony, stating it was ridiculous he would have to walk. Mia expressed that she was following the directions the school provided and she had not been warned that all the ceremonies would be scheduled close together. \r  \n\rI had finally had enough after years of hearing about his behavior, and be the one to pick up the pieces of his daughter. In a calm, but firm tone, told him he needed to apologize to her and mean it. That this day was for her and that he needed to stop making it about him. That he could be angry with me for today, tomorrow, or the rest of our lives but that he would not be mad at her. I had never spoken to him this way. Her mom got involved and asked me to calm down. Her father responded that I was out of line and to never speak to him that way again. After finding out about this, Mia continued to get more upset and wasn\u2019t able to enjoy an incredibly big day for herself. I have seen how hard she has worked to get her degree and the effort she has put in as a first-generation student. I\u2019ve seen the damage he\u2019s done to his family and I couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer.

Your girlfriend is probably suffering from long-term trauma due to verbal and emotional abuse from her father so she gets deeply stressed out when a quarrel happens in front of her. Good for you to defend her.", "NTA. This overbearing person was always gonna be intruding on your relationship eventually. Better to set a clear boundary now before getting into something deeper like marriage or kids.", "Info:\n\nYou've clearly talked to your gf about her dad's behavior and how he treats her, but did you two discuss how she wanted you to interact with him when he's behaving that way? Has she told you she wants you to intervene, and what that looks like?", "ESH... I mean we can all understand exactly why you snapped, but you know you made life harder still for your GF, right? Shaming abusive people for their abusive behaviour more often than not ends up with them taking it straight out on the person they're abusing. Particularly when they have literally demonstrated, the entire car ride, that they are 1000% willing to take out any little unpleasantness in their life on their victims. That includes not just her but very possibly her mother, later - you may also have put Mia's mother in a position where she can't publicly support you or Mia either, for fear of a serve of abuse herself, and she might end up soaking up the business end of his wounded ego anyway.\n\nYou say it's been a few weeks so I'm hopeful her family hasn't immediately demanded she choose between you and them - a choice it sounds like she's not ready to make - but your job here is to help her find her self worth privately and support her to stand up for herself, not to accidentally alienate yourself and make things more difficult. Recognising that you're both comparatively young and one of you is a recently graduated student, therapy might not be an easy option (though a lot of universities have free student counselling) but the sooner you can get therapy the better.", "NTA, she's lucky to have you", "NTA; the dad sounds like an asshole that needs some pushback.", "INFO\nDid it work?", "ESH (well, you and her parents, anyway). I think the better move would\u2019ve been to try to de-escalate with dad - redirect his attention to discuss sports, confirm that yes it was inconvenient to have to walk so far and that maybe the school could use some feedback to make things better for fellow graduates, or otherwise find ways to get him off GF\u2019s back in the moment. \n\nAbsolutely, boundaries need to be set. Absolutely, GF deserves better treatment. But on such an already stressful day, it would\u2019ve been better for her if partner could\u2019ve calmed or redirected dad.", "ESH except poor gf.\nHer dad obviously acts an AH.\nBut you shouldn't have let him drag you down to his level. I'm sure you meant well but look at what happened. You can control your own behaviour, but not her dad's. Next time just hold her hand, ask her to get up/out with you and leave *together*.\nEdit: added together at the end for clarity", "Yta - While it needed to be said, it was the wrong time.   It did not make Mia's day any better.  She knows how her dad is but you made it worse in the moment as well as in the future.   You gave him more ammo to blame and ruin her day.", "*After finding out about this, Mia continued to get more upset and wasn\u2019t able to enjoy an incredibly big day for herself.*\n\nYou've heard him talk like this for years, and you just HAD to call him out on it on your GF's very special day, a day she can't redo.\n\nSo yes, YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not a fight you can win for her sadly", "NTA. Seems like you're the only person she has in her corner. Her parents have failed her for sure.\n\nPlease talk to her and ask her why she doesn't put some distance between herself and her family. Her dad is an abuser and her mother is an enabler, to say the least.", "NTA - plus, he should've dropped his daughter off at the door or something.   \n\nHe seems like a nice feller. /s.    \n\nSounds like putting up healthy boundaries and not taking any crap from the dude is going to be part and parcel for dating this nice young lady. Being able to Grey rock, keep very calm, and point out horrible behavior are some key skills.", "NTA but I would have told your girlfriend in private to remember his treatment when he is old. That someday she'll have the power to treat him like the piece of trash that he is and that she can put him in the crappiest retirement home she can find.\n\nJust say this to comfort her, don't confront her dad anymore.", "NTA.

It takes years to overcome it (especially if the gf been through it her whole life).

It sounds like there would never be a \u201cgood time\u201d to confront the dad.", "So he just sits back and let the father destroy his girlfriend's emotions as the day go by?\n\nI think if you truly love a person it will hurt you deeply to watch the person get abused by anyone. I would think OP is doing any reasonable partner would do. Plus this is not the first time this has happened and it was Mia's special day which she deserved to look back fondly, not remember all the anger from her father. It's not like OP jumped into playing the hero the first time it happened", "Hence the get up and leave part of my comment.", "He made it worse for her.  That type of father is not going to stop because some guy told him off.  Now it's Mia's  fault for bringing a disrespectful \"punk kid or whatever\" to the event and ruining the day.   Mia was upset before, and got worse after finding out what Op did.   In this case, it was not the right time to say something.  It needed to be said but not at that moment maybe after the event, or when Mia was in a position to not have to spend the day with her father.   The timing was wrong, the words were not.", "You also don't just leave someone to be abused so you can wash your hands of it.\n\nI would never, ever in my life be able to watch somebody I loved being abused and do nothing. You stand up for the people you care about, because they are few and far between in this world, and it's what we owe to each other.", "When exactly then would have been the right timing? During dinnertime? While they are watching TV? After they are married at some point? \n\nYou said so yourself a man like that won't stop just because some guy told him off. I'd wager he would even consider it his right to continue the abuse even after Mia is married and have children herself.\n\nIf we are talking about timing, I'd say that day is as right a timing as any. It's his daughter's graduation day, HER day. It should be filled with happiness and celebration and pride for her, not putting her down and scolding her aggressively for something that is out of her control.", "Do you even read? I said, hold her hand and leave together.", ">After finding out about this, Mia continued to get more upset and wasn\u2019t able to enjoy an incredibly big day for herself.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYou admit you've watched the dynamic between Mia and her family for years, yet you chose *this day* to come at her father with a lecture about it? You could have tried to diffuse the tension, or just ignore it---instead you threw gas on the fire.", "NTA. Maybe it won't be apparent immediately, but your girlfriend will remember that you stood up for her when her dad was being mean to her.", "NTA you aren\u2019t enabling abusive behavior. That\u2019s the right thing to do.", "NTA", "right his telling you 'you're out of line' and never talk to him like that again was his attempt to bully you into accepting his roll a lord of the family.\n\nThe response should be \"I won't so long as you don't give me reason to\"\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m going with ESH. \n\nHim for obvious reasons. \n\nYou because you chose to pour oil on the fire. C\u2019mon. You knew he was an unreasonable, abusive person. You had to realize confronting him would escalate the situation. What you said wasn\u2019t wrong, but your timing was atrocious. \n\nIt was Mia\u2019s day. She needed your support, not another angry man making an already miserable situation worse.", "So here\u2019s how you could have handled it better. If the dad/driver had been willing, you could have dropped Mia and her family off at the university and you could have taken the car and looked for parking. That could have de-escalated the tension and prevented dad from having a painful mile-long walk, plus helped Mia get to where she needed to be faster and with less headache and stress. Next time, try to figure out how to make things easier for people - even if it means you have to do a little extra work. That\u2019s a way better option than confronting someone who is already pissed off.", "NTA you stood up for her.  He sounds like a bully that the rest of the family makes excuses for."]}
