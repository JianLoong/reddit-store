I also cook dinner and clean up afterwards while my gf watches the baby. I also do our baby\u2019s night time routine every night before getting into bed myself at 8:30pm, we give her a bath at about 7:30, and then massage her and feed her and she usually falls asleep halfway through feeding (formula fed)\n\n\nThis system works for us and while some people might not agree, i don\u2019t care at all.\n\nMy friend and I were having a random convo over messenger and he was saying how keen he was to sleep in on the weekend, and I responded with saying lol I wish, I don\u2019t sleep in anymore (we rotate getting up during the night on days I\u2019m not working which is the weekend, and I wasn\u2019t complaining I was just stating a fact) and he asked me why I don\u2019t, and I responded with basically what I said above.

Your friend is in for a rude awakening when he has children. You sound like a caring partner/father who appreciates that your girlfriend also needs a bit of down time. Keep doing what you are doing, friend will know soon enough that his 1950\u2019s views on what a partnership looks like are very much, outdated.", "NTA. What does he think a mother does all week?", "NTA that is a system that works for you and he insulted it and basically said you weren\u2019t a man because you help your partner out. I see too often where men say \u201cwell I worked so I\u2019m good\u201d and don\u2019t engage with their children or try to be a more active role in their lives outside of provider. You are setting up a special bond with your child and being someone your partner can count on. You are an awesome dad and partner, don\u2019t let that immature idiot tell you otherwise!", "NTA\n\nThough certain exceptions exist, two parents are equally responsible for making a baby.  So two parents should be equally responsible for *caring* for a baby. That responsibility will continue as that baby grows up.   Beyond that, you and your girlfriend are in a romantic *partnership -* meaning there are two of you who should be sharing responsibilities beyond babycare.\n\nHarsh or not, you spoke the truth.", "NTA nor were you harsh. You both work. You provide income and sue provides care work. What you have sounds pretty great honestly.", "Hahahahahahaha nope.\n\nYour friend either doesn't have kids or his wife secretly hates him.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYour friend is immature and had a stick up his backside about something. Not your problem, you sound like a good husband and father.", "I applaud you for being in a routine already for bub.\n\nHubby and I made a pact that on the weekends, he got to sleep in on Saturdays and on  Sundays, I got to sleep in.  That worked well for us.\n\nAnd those who don't have children can't understand the problems of having babies in the house.", "NTA.", "NTA and good for you and your spouse for being able to communicate and share the load. Sounds like a healthy relationship based on what you\u2019ve stated.", "NTA - He called you fucking stupid, did he really expect you to tell him he's right? I think we can all agree that we hope he doesn't have kids until he changes his attitude.", "Nta ur a great dad and boyfriend and totally right lol", "NTA absolute king shit \ud83d\udc51", "YTA and NTA all at the same time.\n\nI took your comment as a half serious, half joking type thing. The type of blunt comment you should be able to make at your friend who isn\u2019t being that realistic, probably because he doesn\u2019t currently have kids himself.\n\nUnfortunately, as you know, that isn\u2019t how parenting/life works. However, he could get lucky with finding a woman who either shares his view points or is at least willing to compromise and let him sleep in on the weekends. Like you said, this works for you and you don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks - that is what may work best for him/his family if/when the time comes.\n\nEven if your comment wasn\u2019t a joke, you should be able to have serious conversations/debate with your friends on these subjects. At that point your comment would come off as the AH because you don\u2019t have to tell someone you hope they never have kids to kind of state your opinions. If he was able to say \u201cthat\u2019s dumb as fuck\u201d to your routine, why would you be the asshole to say it\u2019s dumb as fuck to expect a woman to take care of the baby on your weekends off just because you worked during the week. (also, not all women are stay at home moms so what then - because he\u2019s the man? because he makes more? what\u2019s the excuse then when both work? lol)\n\nI think it\u2019ll eventually blow over, especially if you\u2019re good friends.

I have my job, there's stuff to do around the home, we do all sorts of stuff together on the weekend, I study to get a better job so that my family will have more money... am I supposed to, I don't know, not take my daughter for our morning doggie walk and sleep until 9 AM or something?
