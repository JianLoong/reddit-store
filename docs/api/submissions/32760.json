Doesn't anyone in your family cook??", "You\u2019re kind of burying the lede on this one. Your sister has tons of takeout leftovers because **your mom keeps going to the hospital for something she\u2019s not telling you about and is so sick she is too tired to cook**. People who go to the hospital multiple times are either being tested for something very serious or are being treated for something very serious. Plus even with the best of insurances, multiple trips to the hospital can be super expensive, so she may be struggling financially as well and not sharing that with you either. I cannot imagine the stress your (single?) mother is under trying to stay healthy enough to take care of multiple children. And after a trip to the hospital and just wanting to feed her kids and be done for the night, the idiots at McDonald\u2019s shorted her an entire meal. ~~If she goes back to get the missing food, her own food gets cold, so~~ **[EDIT: OP said in a comment that mom had eaten before picking up food for kids, but picked up food because she was too tired to cook.]** She sees if she can find a way to make do with what she was given. Then one kid pitches a fit because they are asked to share. And the other kid won\u2019t eat leftovers that are only one day old. \n\n*sigh* That poor woman. \n\n**NAH** \u2026 barely. It sounds like from a comment you made that you are taking on a lot of responsibility to help your mom, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re being spoiled about everything \n.  However there is definitely room for improvement on your end. At the very least you could apologize to your mom for being cranky with her. Since you\u2019re eating a lot of takeout right now, this may happen again, so next time:\n\n+ Share at least something (a couple of nuggets and a few fries) so your sibling at least gets a little bit of the tasty goodness that they\u2019re smelling, and ask the sibling nicely to please eat leftovers for the rest.\n+ If you\u2019re still hungry, scrounge around a bit.\n+ Don\u2019t waste takeout leftovers - food is hella expensive and your mom probably has a tons of bills you know nothing about and every penny saved will help.\n+ Continue to be kind to your mom and try to do things to help around the house without being asked.\n+ See if she would be up to you helping her to order groceries online for delivery that includes easy meals like Lunchables, cereal, precut salad or veggies, sandwich meat and bread, frozen lasagna and garlic toast or other frozen dinners, or even canned soup or canned ravioli. Also pick up paper plates and bowls as well as disposable drinking glasses and cutlery so your mom doesn\u2019t have any dishes to wash.", "NTA\n\nso you bought and paid for 2 meals, and only received 1meal, why didn't your sister/parents go back and collect the missing part of the order.", "Given that you are 14 and didn\u2019t pay for this food, your mom absolutely has to authority to tell you to share.
