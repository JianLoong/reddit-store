Doesn't anyone in your family cook??", "You\u2019re kind of burying the lede on this one. Your sister has tons of takeout leftovers because **your mom keeps going to the hospital for something she\u2019s not telling you about and is so sick she is too tired to cook**. People who go to the hospital multiple times are either being tested for something very serious or are being treated for something very serious. Plus even with the best of insurances, multiple trips to the hospital can be super expensive, so she may be struggling financially as well and not sharing that with you either. I cannot imagine the stress your (single?) mother is under trying to stay healthy enough to take care of multiple children. And after a trip to the hospital and just wanting to feed her kids and be done for the night, the idiots at McDonald\u2019s shorted her an entire meal. ~~If she goes back to get the missing food, her own food gets cold, so~~ **[EDIT: OP said in a comment that mom had eaten before picking up food for kids, but picked up food because she was too tired to cook.]** She sees if she can find a way to make do with what she was given. Then one kid pitches a fit because they are asked to share. And the other kid won\u2019t eat leftovers that are only one day old. \n\n*sigh* That poor woman. \n\n**NAH** \u2026 barely. It sounds like from a comment you made that you are taking on a lot of responsibility to help your mom, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re being spoiled about everything \n.  However there is definitely room for improvement on your end. At the very least you could apologize to your mom for being cranky with her. Since you\u2019re eating a lot of takeout right now, this may happen again, so next time:\n\n+ Share at least something (a couple of nuggets and a few fries) so your sibling at least gets a little bit of the tasty goodness that they\u2019re smelling, and ask the sibling nicely to please eat leftovers for the rest.\n+ If you\u2019re still hungry, scrounge around a bit.\n+ Don\u2019t waste takeout leftovers - food is hella expensive and your mom probably has a tons of bills you know nothing about and every penny saved will help.\n+ Continue to be kind to your mom and try to do things to help around the house without being asked.\n+ See if she would be up to you helping her to order groceries online for delivery that includes easy meals like Lunchables, cereal, precut salad or veggies, sandwich meat and bread, frozen lasagna and garlic toast or other frozen dinners, or even canned soup or canned ravioli. Also pick up paper plates and bowls as well as disposable drinking glasses and cutlery so your mom doesn\u2019t have any dishes to wash.", "NTA\n\nso you bought and paid for 2 meals, and only received 1meal, why didn't your sister/parents go back and collect the missing part of the order.", "Given that you are 14 and didn\u2019t pay for this food, your mom absolutely has to authority to tell you to share.

If something else comes up or goes wrong with the intended dinner plan, how can a parent be expected to fix it and still feed their child? What an insane expectation! \n\n\nSarcasm aside, it\u2019d be one thing if something small was missing or the order was slightly wrong. But this kid straight up didn\u2019t get their dinner. It\u2019s not insane to question why a parent wouldn\u2019t go back to make sure their child got their food\u2026 Literally what else could be more important than making sure your kids eats?\n\n\nEdit: The adult should not be expecting their other child to only have a half a meal so that the other kid also gets half a meal. That\u2019s not a kids responsibility. And if the mom is too busy to drive back to Mcdonald\u2019s she\u2019s gotta figure something else out. I grew up with food insecurity so maybe I\u2019m a bit \u201ctriggered\u201d, but I don\u2019t find it acceptable that the compromise is that 2 kids get half a meal and the brother gets a whole one. All of your children need to eat and that is literally the most basic need a parent has to fulfill.\n\n\nEdit 2: This comment and all of my following comments were made before OP offered up more info about the brother paying for the food and mom being in the hospital.
