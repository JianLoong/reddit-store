If not, dump him.", "NTA - and if they really send the losing videos to everyone, they can open their Sent folder in their emails, so you can see the servers' timestamps on when those videos got sent. Betcha there are none.\n\nYou're not a bad sport or bad loser - they're horrible winners who make playing those games un-fun, and erodes the enjoyment you'd have with those games because of their bullying.", "Definitely NTA.\nI understand if your boyfriend is more so nervous about any tension between you and his family BUT couples are supposed to be a team & if he\u2019s serious about you then he should be defending you, especially about something like this.

Darn, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, I can now go sit in front of the tv, relaxing and watching _Elf_ for the seventh time since Thanksgiving\u2014which is still more enjoyable to this.\u201d  Exit, get snacks and cocktail, enjoy rest of evening.", "NTA.
