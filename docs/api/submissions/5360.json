I have crippling OCD which I've been to therapy for, yet no matter what I do I can't seem to shake the sheer panic I feel when times are not set or people are late for set times without good reason (a lot of my friends, before they knew how anxious it made me, used to show up like an hour late with a coffee). I've explained to them that I'll have panic attacks, anxiety nausea and horrible intrusive thoughts. I know it's ridiculous but no matter how much mindfulness, coping mechanisms, etc. I do that I learned in therapy it just doesn't go away.\n\nThis year I woke up early and got ready for them to pick me up at 10. I got a call at 10 to say they weren't going to pick me up until 2:30 at the earliest. When I asked for a reason they just said 'oh we're going with the flow there's no need to set times'. I once again told them, like I do every time, how much it had upset me that they weren't showing up at the set time again. They then turned it around and started getting mad that I was putting a dampener on Christmas by trying to dictate everyone and micromanage. They kept saying how annoying it was that I have all these 'ailments' that ruin things for everyone else.\n\nFor context, this is consistent throughout my life. One year when I was 8 we didn't get Christmas dinner because we didn't show up until 8pm when grandma had said dinner was at 5. Another time, on my birthday, I told them I wouldn't be home most of the day but I will be there between 2 and 5 and they lost it because I was 'trying to dictate their life'. They showed up at 6 and rang me 64 times while I was in the cinema after I told them that's where I'd be going. We've been turned away from countless reservations, appointments, etc. Because of the lateness.\n\nI have a horrible feeling that my OCD surrounding time and lateness is a burden and my friends just aren't saying anything to keep me from getting upset. I honestly don't know if this is a reasonable boundary or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I am officially diagnosed with OCD.

If you were a member of my family and something so simple was *that* important to you, I would do whatever I could to help you. \n\nThink about it this way: what does it cost you to deal with that kind of uncertainty? A great deal of upset.\n\nWhat would it cost them to just give you a time and stick to it: practically nothing.\n\nSo, definitely NTA.", "Oh gee I wonder why you have ocd. NTA 1000% Take matters in your own hands whenever possible and set your own boundaries like you described for your birthday. If you can, take the train from now on.", "NTA\nI think anyone would be annoyed with that, i know i would. When i have my parents over or they should come to visit, i want to know when they are going to be here. Like everyone, i have my responsibilities and i cant whole day waiting for them to show up. But i can't go anywhere bcs what if they show up then? \nAnyway, i understand you and its much deeper problem. They just do not respect your or anyone's time", "NTA but also not going to change. Is it worth having the discussion with them stressing you out. If I were youbI would just start making other arrangements. If they ask why tell them bit don't change your plans. Let them know this is what you are going to do and when and they can be a part of it or not. If you really want to spend time with them schedule a day or two where you have no plans and it is at there whim. That way you still have some control over the situation but they also get their freedom. \n\nTheir attitude in general is very selfish and self-serving. How have they worked and had jobs?", "NTA. You know who used to do this to me? My 16yo boyfriend. I say this bc what your parents are doing is rude and disrespectful.", "NTA\nI think the concept of reasonable adjustments applies perfectly here. If you have particular needs on how people treat time with you, it\u2019s not reasonable that people must comply to the nth degree with no regard for their life circumstances (e.g. must arrive at 14:00, 14:01 is unacceptable), but it\u2019s completely reasonable that there is an adjustment where you all might come to an understanding it\u2019s not possible to have an exact arrival time but you\u2019ll expect their arrival within an agreed 2 hour window.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve got some great communication in place with your friends and you\u2019ve chosen to be in each other\u2019s lives because you can accommodate each other. Sadly we can\u2019t choose our family though. Thank goodness we can choose our therapist!", "NTA, it seems your parents are the only ones that don't understand what the big deal is when they show up late. I would imagine you seeing repeated consequences like you described has made a direct correlation between being late and \"Something Bad\".\n\nAlso your parents are AH because that's a lot of time if they said they would pick you up at ten and then changed that to 230pm. Four and a half hours difference is a lot. If it was ten minutes every time, that would be different.", "NTA. If someone's on crutches, you don't go mountaineering with them. If someone's an alcoholic, you don't give them booze. And if someone's got OCD, you don't fuck them around with times.", "NTA but start taking control of the situations. Your parents are not going to change and you know every time it is.a.trigger for your OCD so it is up to you to take control. Start taking the train instead of relying on them so you can control when and how you get there a little more. Obviously you can't control if the train is late or something happens but at least you know it is set to leave at say 11am and you can prepare how soon you get to the station.", "NTA\n\nEven if you hadn't OCD, it is generally extremely rude to not show up at an previously agreed time for no reason at all.", "NTA based on what you\u2019ve shared.  It seems your parents are not sensitive to your condition whatsoever and entirely indifferent to respect and consideration of other people\u2019s time and comfort.  Given the examples you\u2019ve shared, they are never going to change so live your life in a manner that doesn\u2019t expect them to be anything more than they are and make your own arrangements/ understand that they are going to miss out on portions of your life because they didn\u2019t bother to show up at the designated time.", "NTA\n\nYour parents won\u2019t change though. Do yourself and your anxiety a favour and don\u2019t accept their offer to pick you up in the future.\n\nI\u2019m so angry on your behalf. They\u2019re being disrespectful and saying that you\u2019re putting a dampener on Christmas when they know you need this certainty has me seeing red.", "NTA. One of the things that help settle my anxiety is knowing what to expect. And it's definitely a reasonable ask. But if it stresses you every year, maybe avoid the stress & take the train. definition of insanity & all that.", "NTA for getting mad, it\u2019s rude as hell to show up that late. However, you\u2019re acutely aware of this issue and they have refused your requests for a set time. You need to take control of your own transport; otherwise you\u2019re voluntarily putting yourself in a situation you hate.", "My paternal family is hours late to everything, there's no way to stop it without a lot of money on the line (i.e. plane ticket, and even then I have so many relatives who've missed airplanes due to lateness) or a really monumental emotional milestone (my chronically late uncle showed up on time to walk his daughter down the aisle, but that could be because she assigned two non-family guests to force him to get there.) Unfortunately, chronically late people are about as reliable towards set times as an alcoholic in front of a fountain of beer. You are NTA, and judging by their comments about your OCD, your family are T A. I would say to talk with them, but you're clearly trying that and they're refusing to meet you halfway. I know living with OCD is stressful (my brother has germ-based OCD) but their behavior is unacceptable, if you're doing work to accommodate them and they aren't doing anything to accommodate you, it's clear who the A H are.\n\nLogistically, there is nothing you can do about their lateness except put as much control over schedules in your own hands as you can. Don't let them offer to drive you places, insist on getting there yourself (whether that be walking, public transit, buying a car, whatever works for you). Make sure you have a key to let yourself in in case you arrive and they've \"popped out\" for several hours. Realize that no time you ever set will be followed and ask them to come an hour or two before you want them to show up (my parents once barely managed to catch a plane by lying to my grandparents about when it took off). Give yourself an easily interruptible task to kill time during long waits (books, laptop, knitting, etc). Find yourself some nice Type A friends (maybe even an S.O.) who share your values so you have spaces you feel comfortable. Take your parents to a family therapy session. I'm just really sad you're going through all this.", "Edit: Imma go with NTA because of age and situation, but please, don't let them free on this. They've been doing it for years, so don't expect them to show up on time, take the next train, find another person to pick you up, something ! You have a part of responsability in this situation you're in \n\nInfo: how old are you ? \n\nOn one end they're the AH for doing it still despite knowing it's a real issue with you. \nOn the other end, depending on if you're a teen or a grown adult, you also have a say on how much you're willing to stick with it considering you know they've been this way since you were a kid, so you have a part of responsability for indulging with it.", "You can\u2019t control the behaviors of others. If not having a set schedule causes you this much distress - then take the train next time.", "NTA. IMO: if they can't change after all the problems their lateness has caused, including your OCD, it's probably time to step away from them. How far is up to you, and I'm only suggesting as much as you can stand. Just a retreat from this circle of hope/disappointment and maybe, if I'm right, your panic may calm down a bit. Please ask your therapist about it, if it hasn't been brought up before.", "NTA. It\u2019s very disrespectful or your time and your mental health. Even if yo ur mental health were not an issue it\u2019s disrespectful and selfish. \n\nI wonder if your patients have anxiety -  they maybe get overwhelmed planning and sticking to a schedule - that\u2019s why they are always late", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
