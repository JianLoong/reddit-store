He continued to get upset with me, said that i\u2019m accusing him of serious stuff and how i always want to be a victim.\n\n**Make it clear that you ARE, in fact, accusing him of serious stuff, and that you are unapologetic about that.** Tell him in no uncertain terms that his \u201cbro\u201d is HIS responsibility when he is in your home, and that if your brother genuinely thinks what you\u2019re accusing him of is \u201cserious\u201d and wrong, then he\u2019d better take it seriously too. \n\nVictim-blaming is disgusting and this needs to go further than your brother.

It\u2019s sucks to change your routine, but there it is. Scream at him to get out any time he walks in on you. Bring a chair into the bathroom and jam it under the door handle or if you can order things online, get one of those devices that reinforces a locked door from the inside. Tell him flat out and loudly every time he tries to flirt that you do not appreciate it.  Others have suggested setting up your phone to record the door when you\u2019re in the shower so you have proof of him coming in and you telling him to get out. I would even film yourself locking it first, in the same video. Be firm and consistent so he cannot manipulate the situation. \n\nYou can expect him to retaliate or act like you\u2019re weird for \u201csuddenly\u201d being like this or \u201coverreacting.\u201d Of course he is going to try and turn it around on you. Do not take this to heart. It is more manipulation. Stay firm. No matter what he says, you are not weird, and you are just making it absolutely clear what your boundaries are. \n\n**If you think your partners would make a \u201cbig deal\u201d out of this and not allow the friend in your home anymore\u2026 GOOD.**", "Like him not harrasing you anymore?

Skip right over your brother.", "Well, no, because he IS a creep.  You are under-reacting here by a mile. \n\nTell your parents.  \"Awkward\" isn't a reason not to.  He's depending on you not telling.  Embarrassment is something to get over.\n\nIf you can't do that for whatever reason - tell them both it WILL stop, and that if it ever happens again, you'll call the cops.  Then, get a door stop.  Lock the door, door stop the door, set up your phone camera.  If he so much as jiggles the door SCREAM.  And I mean, scream bloody murder. \n\nWomen are taught to be polite too often.  Scream.", "NTA. Its sexual assault. Period. Good to know your brother is ok with his friend sexually abusing his sister.....Hope your brother never has daughters. he would be a shitty dad", "NTA but this is beyond creepy and you need to go above your brother to your parents. \n\nThe friend is disgusting and needs to be banned from the house for being a perve.", "NTA. Buy a door wedge and use it anytime you are in the bathroom. Also have a private conversation with your parents and explain what is going on. You are being sexually harassed by someone that is always in your home. And at some point - he might snap and rape you.", "NTA and get a jamb for the door", "NTA\n\nI'd file a police report for sexual harassment because that's what he is doing.", "NTA - SCREAM BLOODY MURDER EVERY SINGLE TIME HE ENTERS!!!! This isn't creep behaviour this is worse! \n\nHe has either feelings for you or wants to fuck you and in many ways it's not gonna be safe and your brother not taking it seriously is a concern. \n\nI mean it fucking SCREAM every single time", "Take a door stopper in the bathroom with you, one of those wedges that goes under the bottom edge of the door. He might get it unlocked but would struggle to get the door open. Or just put a better lock on.", "NTA , but I mean, you\u2019re technically considered an adult and all, and you can use your words to tell him to stop and that he is making you feel uncomfortable. If it persists tell your parents and I guarantee he won\u2019t be allowed over anymore, \u2018golden child\u2019 and all. If he still comes tell him you will call the cops. \n\nPersonally I would never be okay with showering with someone else in the room that isn\u2019t my fianc\u00e9. Having a brothers friend do that to me I would have stopped that shit immediately.\n\nThe way you describe these encounters though it\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re complicit in allowing it to happen, almost like you want to be seen, or you have a problem in standing up for yourself and your body, which is a very very serious problem. You are you\u2019re biggest advocate for your body and well being, please stand up for yourself before something more serious happens.", "This is sexual harassment. Talk to your parents, without the gymbros. If they brush it off, school counselor, police.\n\nNTA", "I would avoid him like the plague.", "NTA\n\nTell your parents, this is sexual harassment. He should never be allowed to step foot in the house again, bare in mind this man has been forcing a lock to gain access and if he feels he can overstep that boundary it's very likely he could try to take it further. Protect yourself and other women, don't let this one go.\n\n Most people would not be just calling him a creep, they would be pressing charges.", "WT absolute F! You are not an AH! Your brother and his friend are! Forget your brother! He obviously doesn't care that his friend is being a voyeur and creep with his sister. It is past time to go to your parents. There is no reason why he should be entering the bathroom while you are in there. He can pee outside if it is that dire an emergency.", "Don't threaten. Tell your parents. Tell the police. Tell his parents. Tell your school, if you're in school.", "Or a rubber wedge doorstop, jam it under the door after you've closed it so it can't be opened.", "Wow. The issues have already arisen. You are being sexually harassed. He needs to stay the F away from you, especially when you're in the shower. Wtf!?!", "Just do it. He is steps away from putting his hands on you.", "Honestly with him walking in on you in the shower tell them you're calling the police next time. This is very very serious.", "This is relatively great advice. But what a lot readers don't realize is a good amount of posts are from non-western countries. Countries where any women fighting back, even slightly, can be a struggle. And I'm not talking like Saudi/Iran. Even just Mexico has a lot of problems to work out. (Not to say the west[US specifically] doesn't has it's own southern/evangelical/mormon/cult problems)", "Commenting so hopefully OP sees this. This is the best advice!", "Go scorched earth, if your parents won\u2019t back you up then be extremely vocal about how you\u2019ve been sexually harassed and your parents are refusing to help. Tell everyone, post on social media, protect yourself before things escalate.", "The GO SPEAK WITH YOUR  PARENTS AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING. stop excusing/ignoring  this before it s too late. Warn the creep that if he ever walk in the bathroom  again you call the police  - he ll be a sex offender. But don't  let him continue  until he attacks you ffs.  Use your brain."]}
