We tried everything to make it work out, spent a long time with various couples counselors, and the conclusion keeps coming up that we\u2019re simply incompatible people. However, we agreed that we needed to be the best co parents we could be no matter what and that we would still split parenting duties and custody as close to 50/50 as possible (I work second shift at a factory, she works from home on a flexible schedule, so I knew going in she would get primary custody for logistics alone). \n\nNow, the house we bought together was actually my grandfather\u2019s old house, I had been living here with the intention of buying before my ex got pregnant, I was just trying to save up the money. When we  found out about the baby, we decided to go all in together and buy it as a couple, bad idea in hindsight but we were in love and ready to be a family, or at least thought so. So knowing that it was a house from my family that I was always intending to get, she agreed that I could just buy out her half and she would find a new place close enough where we could split custody, as her family also lives around here and they\u2019re very close. We also agreed that she could stay here until she found something and that I would just sleep in the guest room and we would basically be roommates, which I\u2019ll admit has been kind of miserable but it just is what it is. However, last night she told me that even with her share of the money there\u2019s just nothing close by that she can afford and the only places she can find in her range are over an hour away minimum. She also said that if she\u2019s goi g to have to move that far away from her family and friends anyway, she might as well just find somewhere even further that she actually likes and completely start over. I told her that would be an impossibility as we already agreed we need to live close so that we can co-parent as smoothly as possible, and that we would just need to continue our current arrangement until she can find something around here. She told me that was just me thinking about myself, that she\u2019s miserable staying in this house, and that her getting a fresh start would be what was best for our son in the long term. I replied that what\u2019s best for our son will always be to be close with both of his parents and that if she can\u2019t make whatever sacrifices she has to in order to make that happen, she\u2019s the one being selfish. I also said that I didn\u2019t want to turn this into a court battle, but I would fight to the death if I had to keep her from taking him.

Realistically, with his work schedule, he can't spend as much time with the kid like his ex who works from home. \n\nThe court will probably factor that in and give him visitation and ex primary custody for that reason alone.

We\u2019re both good, hands on parents and it would be a major disservice to him to take any of that away.

But she is being extra and wants to move even further to start an entirely new life far away from everything if she's already having to lose things. \n\nBut that isn't reasonable. You don't get to alienate a parent and their relatives on both sides just because if your forced into having a fresh start you want it to be entirely different. None of this is better for the kid and ending up in plane travel distance when you want to argue money is so tough doesn't make sense to me. It basically assures that dad only gets to see the kid for 2 days every fortnight and every time he wants to it costs two plane tickets. \n\nNobody would be ok with a dad taking a kid far away from a mother just because he wants a fresh start. I don't see why the opposite is ok with everyone. \n\nAhain 1 or 2 hours to where she can afford if has to, this is a reasonable accommodation.

He owns a house and she has to buy or rent something.  It\u2019s not crazy to suggest that she keep looking for something in the 1hr range before insisting that he up and sell a family home.  I highly doubt that people would be on the side of a father who wanted a mother to sell her family home and follow him across country just because he wanted \u201ca new start\u201d.

You yes you are suggesting staying together. \n\nI don\u2019t see you making sacrifices. Like renting out your house to move where she is going to", "I never said otherwise. The point is she can\u2019t afford to live \u201caround here\u201d. She won\u2019t find anything nearby and he wants her to keep living with him when clearly the living arrangement is toxic.", "It seemed like he was okay with her moving an hour away, he only called her selfish when she started talking about \u201cwell if I\u2019m that far away, I might as well move five hours away.\u201d", "There\u2019s a quite a difference between accepting a place that\u2019s a little below you standard so you child can live near family (not just OP, but also ex\u2019s family as well) and moving who knows how far away just because your ex wants to.  Compromises are for when both people are being reasonable.", "How is it best for her kid if she deprives him of regular contact with his dad, who clearly loves him and wants to be there for him?", "She made him buy her out of the house, he is stuck there for a long time at least the next couple years. Or hes out a shit tonne of money. That was his compromise.", "If OP is describing their attitudes to money realistically, it seems unfair to say she *can't afford* it if the reality is that she's just a spender. It's not fair of her to prioritize her spending over the kid having two parents active and present in his life. \n\nThey should probably explore some compromise of finding a neighborhood they both can afford, but if she's really just blowing her paycheck that won't change just because she can minimize her housing costs. She'll just have more to spend. People who are bad at money management don't just change for better bc they have a little bit more cash after rent/housing costs.", "Yeah it\u2019s clear this post is beyond what we can manage and advise but at the surface level him resorting to go nuclear over something that hasn\u2019t happened yet is the asshole behavior.", "I\u2019m guessing it was a spur of the moment outburst made out of fear of losing his kid, so I\u2019m willing to give that a pass.  Her suggestion of moving far away was more thought-out.", "He needs to calm down and not weaponize her motives   and they both need to compromise. She needs to realize she can\u2019t just move 1000 miles away. That\u2019s not how things work when kids are involved. It\u2019sa even possible a custody arrangement many not allow her to move super far just because she wants to. \n\nThat said, they both need to go to court and have a legal agreement to avoid having an actual bad and horrible situation. Some people think the courts are there only for hotly contested divorces. But they can help make life easier. Hopefully they can settle things before this starts to mentally and emotionally affect their child."]}
