We tried everything to make it work out, spent a long time with various couples counselors, and the conclusion keeps coming up that we\u2019re simply incompatible people. However, we agreed that we needed to be the best co parents we could be no matter what and that we would still split parenting duties and custody as close to 50/50 as possible (I work second shift at a factory, she works from home on a flexible schedule, so I knew going in she would get primary custody for logistics alone). \n\nNow, the house we bought together was actually my grandfather\u2019s old house, I had been living here with the intention of buying before my ex got pregnant, I was just trying to save up the money. When we  found out about the baby, we decided to go all in together and buy it as a couple, bad idea in hindsight but we were in love and ready to be a family, or at least thought so. So knowing that it was a house from my family that I was always intending to get, she agreed that I could just buy out her half and she would find a new place close enough where we could split custody, as her family also lives around here and they\u2019re very close. We also agreed that she could stay here until she found something and that I would just sleep in the guest room and we would basically be roommates, which I\u2019ll admit has been kind of miserable but it just is what it is. However, last night she told me that even with her share of the money there\u2019s just nothing close by that she can afford and the only places she can find in her range are over an hour away minimum. She also said that if she\u2019s goi g to have to move that far away from her family and friends anyway, she might as well just find somewhere even further that she actually likes and completely start over. I told her that would be an impossibility as we already agreed we need to live close so that we can co-parent as smoothly as possible, and that we would just need to continue our current arrangement until she can find something around here. She told me that was just me thinking about myself, that she\u2019s miserable staying in this house, and that her getting a fresh start would be what was best for our son in the long term. I replied that what\u2019s best for our son will always be to be close with both of his parents and that if she can\u2019t make whatever sacrifices she has to in order to make that happen, she\u2019s the one being selfish. I also said that I didn\u2019t want to turn this into a court battle, but I would fight to the death if I had to keep her from taking him.

It's not like she's choosing this distance out of spite, she's choosing a good place to live that's within her budget.

If you don't like the situation, ask yourself what you can do to compromise to improve it. Are you willing to sell your house and move if it means staying close? Are you willing to find a different job or figure out a way you can watch your son for the majority of the time?\n\nEDIT: For people saying just take her to court, keep in mind that if the mom already has primary physical custody she doesn't actually need permission from him to relocate in some states. OP said he can't watch the kid during the day due to his work, while the mom is WFH. I don't see how going to court is really going to benefit him unless his work schedule changes and he fights for primary custody. \n\nI agree the situation sucks for OP and is unfair, but if she has primary custody or is more likely to be granted primary custody, it's probably better he doesn't involve himself in a prolonged legal battle that's going to be expensive for both parties and probably piss the mom off. It's probably a good idea for OP to consult with a lawyer, but I feel like it's also possible they could resolve this without going to court.", "NTA. You're right.

The person that moves can\u2019t unilaterally decide to take the kid away. Luckily courts usually see it that way too", "Hard NTA.  She makes more money than you, she\u2019s just irresponsible with money.  If she can\u2019t afford anything, why doesn\u2019t she just live with her family to save money?

You don't get to alienate a parent and their relatives on both sides just because if your forced into having a fresh start you want it to be entirely different. None of this is better for the kid and ending up in plane travel distance when you want to argue money is so tough doesn't make sense to me. It basically assures that dad only gets to see the kid for 2 days every fortnight and every time he wants to it costs two plane tickets. \n\nNobody would be ok with a dad taking a kid far away from a mother just because he wants a fresh start. I don't see why the opposite is ok with everyone. \n\nAhain 1 or 2 hours to where she can afford if has to, this is a reasonable accommodation.

I highly doubt that people would be on the side of a father who wanted a mother to sell her family home and follow him across country just because he wanted \u201ca new start\u201d.

If it is 50/50, typically, neither parent pays child support.", "She still lives there and owns half of it and rent usually cost more than mortgage. Not sure how unreasonable it is for her to still pay until she sells her half and moves. He never said he refuses to pay her share otherwise she could force a sale. \n\nShe isn\u2019t trapped, im sure you\u2019d also disparage him if he charged her rent after the sale, which again, is more than a mortgage payment most of the time.", "Him not wanting her to move far away with his son is an asshole, but her wanting to move far away with her son is being stupid?", "Reading is difficult for so many in here lol.", "Apparently for some, yes it is!\n\n1. She has not received her portion of the equity in the house.\n2. She is still paying towards the house mortgage.\n3. OP is good with that until EX can find a long-term plan, which she can't because her money is going into paying for his house.\n\nIn all honesty, the house needs to be sold, divide the equity, and both find their own living arrangements!", "Coming up with a long-term plan. Finding a place to live, or other things. In otherwords, until she has a place she's found to move, she's paying what was her half of the mortgage, akin to rent. That's how that comment read to me.", "NTA: You need to start the court battle /now/ before she moves.  Good luck.  Thankfully you were never married so you won't need to worry about her costs.  Crush her.", "File for custody now to establish your rights and the child's primary residence before it is too late. You need a good family law attorney.", "NTA You need to talk to a lawyer about getting full custody.", "If she moved away the easiest thing would be one week on/off or something, or two weeks on/off, or whatever amount of time is most suitable for them. They could meet halfway for handover, there are solutions here - she didn\u2019t say she wants to take the kid interstate, a different town isn\u2019t that bad.", "a completely different school, no family or friends, coming from a child who was apart of a fresh start it\u2019s not as good as it seems", "When my child and the ex went to court for my grandchild. My child wanted to move about 4 hours away because rent was cheaper and a better paying job was there. Well the ex had a cow. It didn\u2019t go like the ex wanted", "That works until he school age.", "I'm about to be dragged in another comment because of this little tidbit (not that I really care tbh). \n\nIf you want the best possible outcome, stop making her pay to live there. Let her save (or not - if her spending problem is that bad, it'll work better for you, as well taking that step in future custody) to have a place nearby. \n\nQuite honestly, depending on local laws of course, she could stop paying and still have access to the marital home and half its equity. It doesn't matter if it seems fair to you, that's still her house too. You bought it together, she's been paying into the equity. \n\nUltimately dude, get a lawyer.", "Sorry, do you expect him to hold her hand and walk her through adulthood? She's living ~~rent-free (he's said that he's covering all the bills for both of them)~~ [ETA: apologies, I just saw a comment that shows inconsistencies here, still not sure on that front, but I'll strike it] in a house that should have just been his (but they married when pregnancy happened) and is willing to buy her out of the house at divorce and give her the rightful half of what they own together. She also makes more than him. So where is her hardship here? What more should he be doing? Buy her a place on top of buying her out of the current home? That seems ridiculous.\n\nHe obvs can't make her stay (doesn't sound like he wants her in his house, but reasonably close by). So what is your advice? He rents her an apartment/house and just continues to support her until their child can choose? Court seems more reasonable.", "Lol if you work from home you still need childcare", "Lmfao.\n\nThanks for putting their hypocrisy on full display.", "No, I don't expect him to hold her hand.   That's not the point here.  She can't afford to stay as close as op wants, and she does not WANT to live rent free IN THE SAME HOUSE with him.   She is going to move to a place that she can afford to, and that is going to be fairly far away.  That's my point.   The only way she could afford to stay as close as op wants...WITHOUT LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE as op would require op to help.  I know he can't.  So, now we're in a situation where she is moving.  Away.  \n\nAnd yes.  The court does seem reasonable, because op has a vested interest in his ex not moving away and is working to keep her in the house where he wants her.", "And while they are in court a judge could very easily place in the order that she\u2019s only allowed to live within so far of him so they can still have equal access to the child.  \n\nOP has said he will get a loan to buy her out of her half of the home.  He isn\u2019t leaving her with nothing", "Well, he should get the loan and buy her out instead of having her continue to pay towards the mortgage.", "You need to file in court to get your parenting plan ordered by a judge. She can\u2019t move your child away if there\u2019s a court order in place requiring her to give you your parenting time. File now, because it becomes much more complicated if you wait until after she moves.", "YTA. \nOkay so I was split on this. Initially it was N A H because you\u2019re both in a bad situation trying to make the best of it. She wasn\u2019t wrong because if she can\u2019t afford to live nearby she can\u2019t afford it. If she needs to move to provide decent housing and living for your shared child then so be it. You were also not wrong for not wanting the primary parent to move so far away with your child. (I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s being selfish but I also don\u2019t blame you for thinking that when hurting.)\nHOWEVER. You mentioned that you have yet to buy out your ex. She is currently stuck financially in a home she\u2019s miserable in-she\u2019s obligated to keep paying for her half! You will only buy her out WHEN she has a decent plan that meets your standards. You\u2019ve practically trapped her in a situation where she can only leave if and when you permit it. That is a total AH move above all else. \n\nIf you do go to court and do plan to force her to stay put, be prepared for all niceties to stop. She still owns half the house and she is not at all obligated to sell it to you. If you do this, she could force a sale. She could force you to buy out her half with NO say in where she goes next-and I don\u2019t know how kind the custody judge will be when he hears the financial entrapment you employed. She could force you to move out yourself. You are playing with fire here. You think you have the power here, but so does she. She doesn\u2019t have to be as nice as shes been-remember that.", "NTA. I was on the fence but for me it\u2019s the idea that since she has to move at least an hour away she should just move even further away. That\u2019s ridiculous. An hour or two apart is pretty manageable. It lets her find a place she can afford and keeps both of you close to the kid.", "This is a recipe for serious legal complications that no one on reddit can solve.  You need to speak to a lawyer.", "NTA", "YTA - is it ideal to have her move far enough away to the point that it's difficult to see your son? Of course not. But do you get to decide where she lives? Absolutely not. The court won't do anything to stop her from moving farther than you would prefer, and plenty of parents deal with long-distance co-parenting.\n\nNow, is she being selfish? Probably. But you're being just as selfish by trying to make her stay nearby.", "Legally, in the US, the court where the child currently lives has jurisdiction (if she tries to move out of state, jurisdiction stays in the original state for 6 months). The burden is on the person who wants to move to seek permission to move. That\u2019s why everyone is saying OP needs to file for his parenting time ASAP.", "He said she makes more money than him but has poor saving habits. She should just budget better and keep the child near his entire family", "Not everyone has family", "He doesn't dispute the assertion that she can't afford to live close to him.  And then, she may just not want to.  This all issues that need to be addressed in court.  Visitation, custody, child support...all need to be handled there.  Op can plead his case to a judge, exactly as he threatens to.  But, there's a risk there that Op needs to consider.  Also, just because she makes more money than him doesn't say how much money she, or he, actually make.", "If he can afford to buy her out of the house and continue living there own his own, and she makes more money than him, then she should reasonably be able to stay close by. She can afford to live about an hour away which isn\u2019t unreasonable, but she\u2019s talking about moving several hours away for a \u201cfresh start\u201d and she\u2019s being selfish. And I do agree, they need to have an official custody agreement drawn up, then it will solve a lot of their issues. I know of some cases where there were clauses included to stop one parent from moving a certain amount of miles away from the other so OP should look into something like that.", "No, she's pretty clear that she doesn't want to stay in the same house as op.", "He hasn't bought her half yet.", "See...without firm numbers and without knowing the area to judge cost of living, I don't know if she is 'reasonably able to stay close by'.   But I certainly can't blame her for trying to move out of an area she doesn't want to live in.  And I'm not going to hold her wish for a fresh start against her. \n\nBut yes, the entity that will actually be determining this isn't her, it isn't op, it's a judge.", "Exactly.  We don't know if they're willing.  If they're able.  If they have the space, etc.  Just because they live close by doesn't mean she's automatically able to move in with them.", "Well said.  \u201cAffordable\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to \u2018mean mathematically possible\u2019 here.", "Not necessarily! Allow I do think it is better for both the parent and the child, the employer actually makes the decision. Some employers do allow WFH employees to not find outside childcare. It depends on the job.", "She can file in court for a partition sale if need be.", "I honestly don't know what that is. But these two people need to separate their finances, find homes within some close proximity that both can afford, so they can move on with their lives while BOTH supporting their child.", "Partition sale: if he refuses to buy her out of the house, she can force him to sell it to get her half out."]}
