My (F321) mom (53) was babysitting for my sister, Sarah (26). They had a falling out and Mom told Sarah to get all the baby\u2019s (m 11 months) stuff and not to bring him back. I only know what Sarah told me and our mom mentioned she wasn\u2019t being paid and that the baby\u2019s father, Calvin, was being disrespectful to her. But I was also told she called him a racial slur. It\u2019s a whole ass mess. \n\nAnyways Sarah asked me could I babysit for her. It\u2019s cheap pay but tbh I don\u2019t really need the money anyway and I\u2019m the only option she has with her hours so I agreed to help her out. I\u2019m supposed to start tomorrow. My mom wanted to come visit at my house to see me and my daughter (6) sometime. I checked with Sarah if she was allowing our mom around the baby because she had mentioned she had our mom blocked. She said she was not so I informed Mom we were going to have to work around our babysitting schedule because Sarah didn\u2019t want her around the baby. At first she was all fine about it but today she asked if she could ask me something without me getting mad. \n\nI said sure. She wanted to know how I was going to let someone control who I let come to my house. It was my house not Sarah\u2019s. She even told me to talk to my husband about it for some reason. I told her he and I had already discussed all of this because of course I keep him in the loop about what I\u2019m doing and wanted him to be aware of all the bs surrounding it in case I needed his support, and he agreed I shouldn\u2019t go against my sister because that\u2019s her child (not that I ever would in the first place). I was like well it\u2019s Sarah\u2019s baby so her rules, I\u2019m not disrespecting her when it comes to her child. \n\nI have tried to stay out of the middle of their issue and I told Mom this.

Keep her away, and you're taking Sarah's side against her.  Refuse to babysit for Sarah, and you're taking her side against Sarah, as Sarah will likely have to back down and let your mother do what she does, in order to get the childcare Sarah can't survive without.

Your mother wants access to your child.  Do you want your child to be around someone who uses racial slurs?  What sort of influence will your mother be on your child?\n\nIf your mother uses racial slurs against your nephews father when she's upset, she'll use racial slurs against your nephew when she's upset. And if your daughter is around, she'll be using racial slurs in front of your daughter, being an example of how such slurs are used, and creating the impression, for your daughter, that this is acceptable.  If you are there, and don't stop her, your daughter will think this is acceptable.  If you stand up to your mother when she does this, your daughter will then be witness to a loud, upsetting argument as your mother tries to defend her behavior as normal and appropriate.\n\nFigure out what boundaries you want when it comes to your mother, and what influence you want her to have on your daughter.", "You're not the AH but your mom is.

You are respecting your sister's boundaries with her child. \n\nYour mother is attempting to stomp all over everyone's boundaries to get her way. She even undermined you by telling you to discuss it with your husband, who isn't even involved in this. \n\nDon't fall for her manipulations. She's good at it.

You have to draw the line somewhere.", "This is your sister's child,  but you're also doing her a favor; ot's your house, and you get to make the rules for what you're okay with. She can accept your boundaries or find other childcare.  So it really boils down to you deciding what you're okay with and taking responsibility for that.  You can have any boundary you want,  just be clear that they're your boundaries and communicate that. NAH, because your mom's question is reasonable when you're not communicating ot as your boundary.", "NTA! \n\nIf she was racist/made racial slurs to one of your nephews parents then she is racist TO your nephew too and therefore a danger to him. \n\nShe needs to be out of all of your lives. It sounds harsh, but as an adult, if she is still continuing to cause trauma and/or has the ability to traumatise the next generation then YOU and you sister now have the power to stop that.", "Yup, OPs mom is being so manipulative.\n\nSarah isn't telling OP who she can/can't have in her house, she's saying who isn't allowed around her child. She's not banning OP from having mom over/having a relationship with her, OPs mom is welcome to come when OP isn't baby-sitting. a completely reasonable request.\n\nIf OPs husband was hosting a boys night, and asked if OPs mom not come over during that timeis she going to accuse him of being controlling?
