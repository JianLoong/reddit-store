She always thinks things should be her way.", "Yes I figure that is the main reason my sister doesn\u2019t want her around and I don\u2019t blame her! It\u2019s not right! His father is biracial (black and white), sooo so is my nephew. \n\nI admit his father has been bad to my sister in several ways but she\u2019s still with him and that\u2019s her choice. It\u2019s her life and for some reason our mother can\u2019t cope with that. There\u2019s other ways to express dislike than going for the worst thing you can think of ffs. \n\nI didn\u2019t talk with her or let her around my daughter for like three years. She knows I\u2019m not above going no contact either so she needs to watch herself. I was trying to start anew with her but she\u2019s still go so many of her old ways clearly.", "Thank you. I\u2019m trying my best here.", "Lmfao. My bad about that \ud83e\udd23", "Right. It is my house and I\u2019m not letting her here when my nephew is. That\u2019s my decision. I\u2019m not losing my sister over her. Not doing it. I\u2019d never disrespect anyone when it comes to their child anyway just period but my sister means too much to me to lose.", "You\u2019re right. I keep her at arm\u2019s length anyway but this shit has got me off kilter. I mostly just wanted her to leave me tf alone about it but I suppose I should be more firm.", "Thank you and I do intend to do exactly what you\u2019ve just said.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with similar!\n\nBut that\u2019s my plan. I can\u2019t leave my sister out to dry. I\u2019m gonna help her and my mom just has to deal with things as they are.", "We are very low contact as it is because of just that. I have been easing into this relationship with her because beforehand I was no contact with her. Like she hadn\u2019t even laid eyes on my daughter for like three years.", "Exactly and this is where. I\u2019m not being disrespectful when it comes to someone\u2019s child. If anybody did it with me I\u2019d never trust that person again. I\u2019m not losing my sister for/over her.", "She really is. I was hoping after me going no contact with her for like three years she would\u2019ve changed, maybe learned her lesson but apparently not.", "A typo lol. I put 32 at first. I\u2019m always trying to age myself for some reason. But I\u2019m 31 so I was trying to put that. Guess I didn\u2019t erase the 2 \ud83d\ude43\ud83e\udd23", "RIGHT. That was so wild to me. My husband isn\u2019t controlling so I dunno why tf she thought he\u2019d be like, \u201cFuck that your mom is coming when she wants.\u201d \n\nMy husband and I discuss everything don\u2019t get me wrong. We have mutual respect and are best friends, truly. Full transparency here tho, he actually wasn\u2019t too keen on me doing the babysitting because of all the drama attached to it, but he said it was ultimately my decision and he\u2019d respect what I chose to do. \n\nWhen I told him I was going to he said he understood why I did it, because I\u2019m the only option she had and I have a good heart and wanna help. But he also let me know if any bullshit occurred with my sister or her baby\u2019s father, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it because he\u2019d step in and have my back, I wouldn\u2019t even have to do anything. \n\nI know this is all off topic I suppose but just so ppl understand what kind of man my husband is. He\u2019s not some asshole. He\u2019s not controlling nor is he going to be manipulated, and is ALWAYS going to be there for me when I need him, and our daughter of course. He\u2019s very Papa Bear and very protective. I dunno why she thought he\u2019d ever chose her side over mine in the least.", "Yeah I\u2019m not losing my sister over this. I\u2019m just not. And you\u2019re right about it all. If I\u2019m being honest here I\u2019m on my sister\u2019s side. \n\nI know how our mother is. I was no contact with her myself for a very long time. I just hate we\u2019ve fallen into the same old bs yet again. It\u2019s disappointing.", "He\u2019s biracial himself (black and white). She acts like she hasn\u2019t even done anything wrong to the baby.", "Thanks!", "Being a raging alcoholic, leaning on me for emotional support since I was seven years old, having to take care of her and my younger sister since then, emotional (of me) and physical abuse (both of my sister). Being a narcissist and never owning up to her actions/never being wrong, being mentally unstable and never getting help so we just have to deal with her depression and unstable behaviors. \n\nMaybe more but that covers a good bit.", "Yeah I will if it comes down to it.", "It\u2019s not like she\u2019s out here all the time anyway but now I\u2019m babysitting she\u2019s all up my ass. Yeah I\u2019m not doing that at all. I\u2019m not letting her around because I\u2019d never disrespect my sister like that. I\u2019m not losing her over this shit.", "Thank you so much. And for sure. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do. I\u2019d love to spend the time with him and my sister didn\u2019t want to have to leave him with someone unfamiliar either.", "Thank you. Yeah I was no contact with her for like three years. I\u2019d figured she\u2019d learned her lesson but apparently not. We have been limited contact still really. She\u2019s not around a whole bunch and may be even less after all this bs.", "That\u2019s exactly how I feel. I\u2019ve already been no contact with her before. I\u2019ll do it again if I need to to protect myself/my family.", "I\u2019d never.", "Thank you.", "Thank you. I try.", "You\u2019re right. She\u2019s not pushing me over tho. This is my home. It\u2019s my sisters baby. We set the boundaries and have control.", "Yeah she is. I\u2019m not stupid tho. I\u2019m not putting up with her shit.", "We\u2019ve really been low contact since we started back communicating but she\u2019s just all in my face now. But not really. I don\u2019t want to keep on with her. I don\u2019t have the capacity.", "Thanks. I think so too. I\u2019d never do that tho. I\u2019m not losing my sister over her bs.", "I have my own issues for sure but I definitely feel I managed to be the most stable of us all somehow \ud83d\ude43 thank you.", "So true.", "It\u2019ll be Tuesday through Saturday and the occasional Monday but no. My mom would only come visit maybe once a month or so anyway. It\u2019s not like my mil. She\u2019s out here every day just about. \n\nWhich it has been awhile since we\u2019ve seen her but there\u2019s Mondays you know? She\u2019s really pressed it since I mentioned the babysitting.", "Thank you.", "Yeah I am in totally fine with Sarah setting the rules for her baby. I\u2019m a mother myself and if someone went against my wishes for my daughter that I\u2019d made clear I\u2019d be pissed. I\u2019d never disrespect her as a mother.", "Thank you.", "She\u2019s trying to manipulate me to put it simply. It\u2019s not gonna work.", "Yeah. Wanting to make a conflict between my husband and I as well for some stupid reason. Not gonna happen.", "Thank you and that\u2019s the plan for sure.", "Agreed. She doesn\u2019t even think she did anything against the baby but\u2026 \nI don\u2019t want my daughter hearing that mess or thinking it\u2019s okay, no. She needs to change her ways but I dunno. She hasn\u2019t to this day so I\u2019m probably just pissing in the wind here.", "It is a point I need to make to her that she was wrong for that and it\u2019s one reason Sarah doesn\u2019t want her around the baby. I am trying, trying so hard to do what\u2019s right here.", "I don\u2019t have to babysit on some Mondays so my intentions were to visit with her then. I forgot my husband has a dentist appointment this coming Monday tho. Not sure if he\u2019ll have work done tho since he\u2019s gotta be evaluated first. But she said her deal is they weren\u2019t paying her right and Calvin was disrespecting her. That\u2019s her side of things but I think that\u2019s why she wants to visit so badly, to tell me what happened from her point of view.", "Wow lol. Tell me how you really feel. \nI love my mother. I\u2019ve been through hell with her already tho so no need to go back.", "That\u2019s nice\u2026 I dunno how I\u2019m bad for respecting someone\u2019s wishes when it comes to their child. Do you have kids??? I doubt it. I\u2019m staying out of it as in I\u2019m not being drug into her bullshit. I know this woman. Like I said years worth of trauma. She\u2019s a manipulator and I\u2019m not going there with her.", "She tried to get me to talk to my husband and acted like he\u2019d tell me different. Like???? My husband isn\u2019t some controlling asshole and he agreed you don\u2019t mess over ppl with their kids anyway. I don\u2019t always have to babysit on Mondays so she could totally come visit then if she\u2019s gonna act right.", "Some of the most manipulative people I\u2019ve dealt with have done the whole \u201c*You* need to stand up to the people *I* don\u2019t like so I can get *my* way!\u201d schtick.\n\nLike, I\u2019m standing up to you RIGHT NOW. *You* are the villain here", "So she's suddenly interested in seeing you during the ONLY time you're caring for the child of someone she's in a conflict with? Keep her away OP, her motives seem anything but innocent", "She thought she had a *gotcha* with her question about letting other people decide who is allowed in your home. YOU decide who is allowed in your home, but your sister decides who is allowed near her child. You've done the right thing. Don't let your mom try to twist things around.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she even wants to see her grandson. She just wants to undermine Sarah.", "Your NtA for helping your sister. I\u2019m Mexican and my wife is white. If her mother would\u2019ve said a racial slur to me we would both agree to not let our baby see her mother. If the baby is biracial and grandma has a race issue, how could we feel comfortable letting them around each other?", "Message mum back and tell her the time you would like her to visit.  You mum doesn\u2019t dictate when she can enter your house, this is your call and you want to allow it when suits you.  Your mum doesn\u2019t have a right to question your reasons. It\u2019s a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d offer.", "I don\u2019t see this as taking sides at all. She agree to watch the kid and mom gets to say who can\u2019t be around her. You aren\u2019t agreeing that either of them is in the right, all you are doing is respect your sisters boundaries. If your mom chooses to see that as you taking sides that is on her, and it\u2019s pretty good proof that she is in the wrong. She is asking you to betray your sisters trust", "I would NOT establish boundaries with your mom by telling her she was horrible because I can assure you that is throwing oil on a fire and it is exactly what she wants; proof that you are a mean daughter ganging up on her. Your mother likely wants a reaction, if you keep calm and don't respond you'll depower her.\n\nAnd yes you can stay out of it if she tries to talk about their fight you can say \"I don't want hear about this, this is between you and her.\" You are not choosing sides, there are no sides your mother is trying to convince you that you need to pick one, and by picking one you are abandoning the other person. You aren't; don't let your mother trick you.\n\nIf your mom tries to manipulate you by accusing you of letting someone control you you can firmly say \"That is not what is happening, Sis didn't make me sis asked and I am CHOOSING to follow her requests because that is what I want to do, and my relationship with my sis is between me and her not you.\" Remind her that she is not banned she is just not allowed over when in it's an inappropriate time, just like she can't pop over on date night or 3 am. If she keeps pushing you can tell her \"I'm sorry I don't want to talk about this we need to move off topic if you can't we'll have to talk later.\"\n\nHow your mother treated you when you were younger is a separate issue from this and I'm guessing your mother is narcissistic and doesn't take responsibility for her actions so trying to get through to her might not be possible and will just cause more drama. But it's important to remember that your mother is crazy and selfish so you can disregard her accusations.", "You're *showing* her you're stronger by sticking to your guns and not letting her try to talk herself out of respecting boundaries. That's way more powerful than telling her.", "The older we get the more we realise some people just won\u2019t change, regardless of what they say and their short term actions - mainly because they don\u2019t want to.\n\nCutting her off permanently was the best thing I ever did, the peace both inside my head and in my life is indescribable \ud83d\udc9c", "I take it you already know /r/raisedbynarcissists ?", "That's good!  I'm proud of you!!\n\nWhen my child was in their 20s they actually thanked me for limiting the time they spent around my parents.   We had ended up going no contact the final 5 years of my mother's life.  It was soooo peaceful!!", "He sounds like a good partner, ready to support you, thats good", "Sadly, that's what happens with toxic people, it's a neverending cycle of trying to give them chances and they keep fucking it up", ">I was no contact with her myself for a very long time.\n\nBetter go back to it again, because I am sure mom is not done with this and she's gonna have a go at you", "Oh honey I am sorry! I hope you go much lower contact with your mom, she sounds like a nightmare.", "if that child were in danger because of its parents order i bet you would :D", "Then carry on as you are doing. NTA.", "We should always stand up to racists. We should never be complicit through in action.", "She's trying to manipulate him too, trying to take advantage of machismo. She thinks he'll take this as a threat to his masculinity and demand she be allowed over because nobody tells a *man* what guests he's allowed to have in his own home.", "You\u2019ve got a point. I\u2019m not that easily manipulated. She\u2019s got me messed up.", "Yeah she\u2019s trifling as hell for this. I\u2019m not gonna forget it.", "Thank you!", "Yep. Sounds like a question intended to manipulate OP.", "Yeah\u2026that was a helluva reach on her part!", "It would make her happy too I\u2019m sure.", "Yeah exactly. She acts like she did nothing to the baby but she 100% did by using a slur against his father who\u2019s dna he has half of.", "I don\u2019t babysit on Mondays so that was the plan but like I told her my husband has a dentist appointment this coming Monday and I dunno if he\u2019ll have work done since he\u2019s being evaluated so of course I want to go with him.", "I mean I feel my mom was in the wrong. I don\u2019t care what happened. She shouldn\u2019t have used a racial slur. I\u2019m just trying to stay out of the middle, mostly trying to stay away from my mom\u2019s bullshit manipulation. I\u2019m not going to be feeding my mom info about my sister and I\u2019m not going against my sister\u2019s wishes when it comes to her baby. I would never do that.", "Thank you for this.

He knows everything I\u2019ve been through and understands me.", "Clearly so.", "I figure she\u2019s not done either. I\u2019ll do what\u2019s best to protect myself and my daughter.", "Thanks. I\u2019m am pretty low right now but yeah I\u2019m gonna do what I need to. I\u2019ve flat out been no contact with her before. If she keeps up with all this master manipulator bullshit she\u2019s gonna get kicked back to the curb.", "Oh well yeah. That\u2019s extreme so I didn\u2019t even think about it.", "Thanks.", "Very true.", "Yeah my husband isn\u2019t that stupid thank god lol.", "The question she asked you was supper manipulative, and she wanted you to start a fight with your sister. No wonder you were NC with her.", "If she caused you so much trauma I'm surprised you even let her around your child or in your home.", "Yes, come join us! We are your people! NTA", "You are awesome and strong and you also do not seem bitter or taking on any of the fleas! Well done, I hope you are proud of yourself.", "\"Mom, you're right. I'm the one who decides who gets to come in my house, and I've decided that you don't get to come into my house while my sister's baby is here.\"", "She\u2019s tried playing us off each other for years. Since we were children tbh. I\u2019m not tolerant it anymore.", "So I\u2019m a liar I guess\u2026 \n\nI was no contact with her for like three years when my daughter was a toddler. I reached out wanting to start anew after my grandmothers both died. It shook me and made me think maybe I\u2019d have regrets not trying to have a good and possibly normal relationship with my mother. I didn\u2019t want to live with regrets. I am not above cutting contact with her again to protect myself or my child either so there\u2019s that.", "Now I\u2019m sitting here crying \ud83d\ude2d you\u2019re so sweet, thank you for saying all of this.", "Yep. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m gonna tell her if she keeps on.", "Genuinely sorry. I didn't mean to hit a nerve. I've just had to cut off a lot of people that are toxic and that's where I was coming from.\n\nI also didn't call you a liar... no idea where that came from.", "You cannot have a \"normal\" relationship with someone who is demonstably not \"normal.\"", "Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to pop off. I\u2019m just not in a good mind frame rn I guess. I understand. I\u2019ve been there and might have to go back there unfortunately. I know how it is. I wanted things to be different this time but some ppl never change I guess.", "I really am sorry you're dealing with this. I think one of the hardest things about trauma, going NC, and reconciling is that you can always be on edge waiting for it to go bad again and wondering when/if you should go NC again. It's like you can never relax. That's how I feel anyway. \n\nI do think you're an amazing sister and sound like a great mom. You and your sister are breaking these cycles of toxicity for yourselves and your kids and that's no easy feat.", "People can change, if they want to change, and if they have the right support.\n\nThe problem right now is that you want your mother to change, but she doesn't see the need to change, or *want* to change, so you're tying yourself in knots trying to ***make*** her change.\n\nShift the burden.\n\nYou want to protect your daughter, and your nephew.  That means keeping your mother away.  If she wants to see them, then it is up to her to decide to change, and to work on being a person who will be a good influence on impressionable young children.\n\nTry writing a list, of the specific things that need to change.  E.g., her racism, etc.  Know what you are looking for in a grandparent for your child.  Don't just look for words of apology, look for acts of restitution, to make right what she's done wrong.  \n\nBeing an active grandparent in your grandchild's life is a privilege and responsibility.  Not a right.  Your mother needs to show that she will meet that responsibility, and that she is worthy of the privilege.", "Sometimes they can't change and sometimes they simply don't want to.
