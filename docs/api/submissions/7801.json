I am not a Fan of crowdfunding weddings, but this is something that you are started with your friend group and you accepted $550 from your friend towards your own wedding (the fact that the marriage did not last long is bot your friend's fault).

It doesn't have to match what she gave you, but  you should give something.", "YTA for so many reasons, but I'm just going to highlight the fact that you think her helping you pay for your wedding is irrelevant because you couldn't make your marriage work? Did I read that right?", "YTA.\n\nYou had me in the first half, not gonna lie.  Crowdfunded weddings seem tacky as hell.  But she helped pay for your wedding!  Refusing to do the same is incredible rude.

Especially a doctoral candidate. That implies the parts of your memoir that might be interesting haven't happened yet.

However, returning a favor is what a good friend should do. She seems like she is being understanding, asking for just a little bit.

I would show this gesture if she was my close friend.\n\nAnd she gave 550 for you, she doesn't even ask that much, come on!", "YTA for sure. First, if you're attending your wedding you will be bringing a gift so why do you care if its a gift or contributing to her wedding? It doesn't sound like she is asking for an absurd donation and IDK what her husband having a job has to do with anything. Second, then we find out that she helped pay for your wedding to the tune of $550 along with your other friends and this is apparently a pretty normal thing in your friend circle.

But then the shoe dropped.  You all made a most ridiculous pact to do this.  She gave you $550, and now you want to stiff her.  Nope, you pony up at least $550!  You are a total AH and a pompous one at that.  The part about your marriage not lasting a year! Complete irrelevant!", "YTA You agreed to pay for each other's weddings (which is a terrible idea in the first place) and she and your other friends paid for yours.

You took advantage of your friend already by taking her money and refusing to return the favor.", "YTA for not trying to make a contribution in a meaningful way. It cost $50 to get enough ingredients to make over a hundred cupcakes. Absolutely absurd that you mention a memoir as an excuse.

You made an agreement, your friends fulfilled their obligation, and now you're trying to renege on your responsibility.\n\nNow she's asking for help even if it's a trivial amount (seriously, it's $20) and your response is to refuse. How is expecting reciprocity and fulfilment of an agreement you entered into and have already benefited from you being taken advantage of? Is your plan to stiff all of your friends? For someone supposedly decently educated, you have a lot to learn on basic life and social skills. Read a book on social capital.\n\nYes, you're incredibly selfish. I get the financial difficulties of being a Ph.D. candidate, I've been one myself and lived with a shoestring budget, but that's not a pass to be a greedy, self-centered cheapskate. I still gave wedding presents even if it was less than what I would've liked. Presents for others are part of having a budget. Yes, it meant I had to make sacrifices, but that's fucking life.\n\nYour alternatives frankly suck. Advice on decorations? That presupposes she has no idea what she wants and is something normal friends do without considering it a gift. Emotional support? Yeah, that's the bare minimum threshold for a friend. You can afford to fly there, but not to give a small donation because as you've put it, you flying there doesn't exclusively benefit you. But not flying out and sending a donation in lieu isn't fair to you either because you don't get the benefit of seeing your friends. You have some really selective accounting there. Literally every bit of this is transactional assholery where if you're not the sole beneficiary, it's a raw deal in your eyes. This is just staggering levels of self-centered assholery.\n\nHow does she benefit from being in your memoir? Seems like a way for you to pad out your page count. Newsflash: no one is going to want to read the memoirs of a self-centered, low-life who hasn't accomplished shit in their lives and has zero perspective of how the world operates. Stop wasting your time and find a fruitful endeavor. Seriously every hour wasted on this self-aggrandizing bullshit is an hour you could be working on your dissertation and, as you've explained, you spend more than a full-time job's worth the hours thinking and writing it. What is your doctoral advisor saying? Are they happy you're siphoning 50 hours a week towards a vanity project.
