Not wanting to interrupt or invade her privacy, I knocked on the door and politely informed her that I needed to get my books.\n\nThere was no response, and they continued. I decided to give them some time, so I left for about 10 minutes, thinking they might be done by the time I returned. However, when I came back, they were still at it. I knocked again, but once again, no response.\n\nAt this point, I was starting to feel a bit impatient because I couldn't afford to be late for class. So, I decided to enter the room to grab my books. My roommate got understandably upset, expressing that I invaded her privacy by barging in without her consent.\n\nI understand that walking in like that might have been uncomfortable for her, and I feel bad about it.

I am sure you can still have boyfriends and sex even though you share a bedroom. I am not saying OP is wrong, she did not barge into the space she knocked several times. But both women share the space so now they must establish some rules. Probably on having sex during the day.", "Does cuddling count as part of sex though?", "Honestly, my last few times I've been able to go for like a solid 40 minutes. It was more so I got tired than me cooming. Idk whether it's because I'm young (24) or just cause I last longer but shit. \n\nAlthough reminds me of a funny story from last year. I was close to finishing up with a friend up at my parents trailer park who was in an open marriage and her husband ended up walking in right as I was about to finish. He just sits there waiting and I'm like yeah... I should go \ud83d\ude02 Most awkward situation I've been in my life lmao", "I'm a major proponent of both partners having open communication when it comes to all aspects of sex. Not just penetration sex, whatever is used. If you don't say what feels good, and more importantly what doesn't, they're running off guess work. And that's no fun for anyone. So then they just figure oh well I can't do it right however I try so they do what feels good for them and their partner feels left out!", "I will say I stopped using my hitachi because it majorly reduced my clitoral sensitivity. I noticed a suction toy doesn\u2019t do it, but vibration does. But now I have antidepressants not helping that either lol.", "Is it like a flex that y\u2019all  can\u2019t cum fast or something?", "Oh I missed that.", "Yup. I missed where she said something.", "If you got nuts in guts, yes.", "No.  There is no time where either roommate can say I'm getting fucked you can't enter.", "Maybe her mouth was full ? I\u2019m talking blowjobs", "If we say yes, and also include the cleanup and peeing time afterwards, does that mean I can be more liberal with my durations?", "If my dick touches the butt it counts but now typing this out i feel awkward cus im a guy who works in a cramped kitchen with a bunch of other guys", "Yes. Communication is key with a healthy sex life.", "Lmao that\u2019s untrue. Also lots of women can keep going after they orgasm just common knowledge. Don\u2019t be bitter it\u2019s not cute.", "This whole thread is simultaneously comforting and hilarious.", "Im not sure why you are needing so much attention about your sexual prowess but I believe you if that makes you feel better.\n\nGo head girl and make all the love\u2019"]}
