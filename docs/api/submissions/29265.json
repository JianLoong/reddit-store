We've been trying to accommodate our guests' dietary preferences, including vegans, by offering not one, but two vegan menu options. However, one of our guests, my cousin (let's call her Lila), has become quite vocal about wanting more vegan choices, and it's causing a lot of drama.\n\nLila went vegan a year ago, and we respect her dietary choice. In addition to our regular wedding menu, we made sure to have a vegan main and a vegan dessert option, thinking that would be sufficient to cater to her needs. But she recently reached out to us, expressing her disappointment that we weren't offering more vegan dishes and insisting that she NEEDS to have a wider variety of options.\n\nNow, here's where I'm confused. We've already made considerable efforts to accommodate Lila's dietary needs, even though she's the only vegan attending. She's suggesting that we should add more vegan dishes to the menu, which would require significant changes and additional costs at this point. Our budget is already stretched, and we have limited time to make significant adjustments.\n\nWe don't want to be inconsiderate, but it feels like she's being unreasonable and demanding more than what's practical, given the circumstances. AITA for not providing more vegan options at my wedding when there are already two, or is Lila out of line for making this request at the last minute?\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you for all your input, Reddit. Unfortunately, things have taken a rather unexpected turn. After the initial post, my cousin Lila, who also happens to be my Maid of Honor and has contributed to part of the wedding (not catering) , has become even more insistent about having more vegan options at the wedding. In fact, she dropped a bombshell on us.\n\nLila contacted us and said that if we don't provide a more extensive vegan menu, she won't attend the wedding at all and she expects a refund on what she helped pay for.

I am fully of the belief that events with food should take in to account the dietary restrictions of guests, but if everyone has ONE thing they can eat (like a substantial thing) they can shut the F up. I've been to weddings where all the food is spicy and I don't like spice- I eat what I can, I smile, I get fast food on the way home. I've been to weddings where there is one vegan option, and I've been to weddings where all the food is shit so no one has a good meal. The point of going to a wedding is not to get a free meal, it is to celebrate the union of two people. \n\nTell Lila- \"there are two vegan options for you, I look forward to seeing you at the wedding\" and then simply do not respond to anything else. If she brings it up face to face, just look her in the eye and say \"come or don't come, I'm not having this conversation anymore\" and literally walk away. And continue to walk away from any conversation about the menu. This is someone making an event about them, and the best way to stop it is to not engage. Laugh it off with a brief \"oh there's a vegan option\" to anyone who asks and change the subject.", "Nta - she\u2019s trying to control the narrative here. You have made accommodation for her and this isn\u2019t a restaurant, it\u2019s a wedding.

When it comes down to it, she doesn\u2019t have to attend.", "Lila sounds like the most entitled, self-centered jerk to ever jerk. She is the reason why people poke fun at vegans to begin with...how many options does she need? How much is she planning on eating? If its that much of a problem she should bring her own food. Why have multiple options if she is the only one eating it? That would just be a waste of food unless she consumes all of it.\n\nI have seen several posts where someone who is vegan holds an event and invites non-vegans, but doesn't provide any options that have animal product in them, but if a non-vegan holds an event they are the devil if they don't provide any vegan options.  Like where is this sense of entitlement from?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: \" She told us that we \u201c\"care more about this stupid wedding than her\".\" Its YOUR wedding, this sounds more like \"why cant your big day be about me\". If you didn't care at all you wouldn't provide a vegan option to begin with.", "What specific options is she asking for?  Is this a buffet or a sit down meal with preplated food?", "NTA. Though I think you might need to have a sensitive conversation with Lila about finances. Where you ask if she needs the money back - and if she says yes, I would try to return what you can. \n\nSometimes in life we want to be generous, but we get an unexpected bill or misfortune and can't afford it. I worry this could be something like that - in which case Lila will just keep finding excuses to get what she paid back. \n\nIf this is the issue, and you have a conversation about it, you might be able to find a decent compromise where you return some money and maybe get to keep some. Rather than the current situation where Lila just keeps nitpicking until you return the money.\n\nThere's also a separate conversation to be had about the menu. Does Lila, specifically, want something else to eat at the wedding? Is it that she truly wants more options, or is she just trying not to sound petty that she doesn't like the option you've selected.\n\nAlso... Does the vegan option contain anything that has alcohol in it? Like white wine in risotto? Or rum in cake? If there's any chance she could be pregnant I would just look out for that. Cooking burns off a lot of alcohol but typically not 100%. Don't ask about this!! Just a consideration. \n\nShe's the only vegan guest, so if she's not happy with the options it's probably more straightforward for you to amend her order or switch options than to expand the entire menu.\n\nFinally, does she not want to be MoH? If it's become too much of a burden, this could be an attempt to quit. So find out if she needs to take a break, or become a regular guest, or can't come anymore. \n\nIf she doubles down and insists you either offer more vegan options or refund her then it's up to you. I would consider refunding just to not have it hanging over me. But either way, make sure the cost to refund her would be more than the cost to pay for additional options - otherwise you're just robbing Peter to pay Paul.", "After reading your update, here's what I would do. Ask the catering company  for a quote on how much more it'll be to add more vegan dishes to the menu. After that, send Lila the bill. Considering she's the only vegan, and she's adamant about having more options (even though you were nice enough to give her a dish and a dessert), she can foot the bill for making a change in the menu this late after creating a menu.", "NTA\n\nI am a vegan and have been for going on a decade. One vegan option for each course is great. Some vegans can't eat certain vegan foods due to health reasons (allergies/intolerances) but if they told you in time you could try to find one vegan option that works for all vegans (in this case just Lila). You were considerate enough to find a vegan option, Lila should be appreciative.\n\nI would just message her back: \"Hi, sorry you are not happy with the vegan option we arranged for you. You are the only vegan attending our wedding and we have specifically included a vegan main and a vegan desert just for your benefit as no one else requested a vegan option. If you do not like these options, you are welcome to bring your own meal and we can request the caterer that they heat up your food in a microwave, if you prefer that over the vegan options available at the wedding. You are also welcome to order vegan food in and have it delivered to the venue.\"\n\nBTW: If you have a vegan main and a vegan desert, you have ONE vegan option, NOT two. Saying 'two vegan options' suggests there are two vegan options PER COURSE.", "Of course OP fails to mention in the original post that this person was helping PAY for the wedding.
