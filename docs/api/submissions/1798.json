Let's call this best friend John.  (if you've seen one of my other posts this is a long series regarding the same John).  One day, I made a batch of chocolate chip cookies and when they came out of the oven, I brought one cookie up to the office where my husband usually hangs out because I wanted to do something sweet for him and feed it to him.  Upon walking in the office, I saw that John was also in there and I knew it would make my husband feel awkward if I fed it to him in front of him.  So, I just handed him the cookie instead and told both of them that there are cookies downstairs if they want to get some.\n\nAfter I left the room, I overheard them saying that it was messed up that I didn't also bring a cookie for John (I didn't know he was in the room).  I confronted my husband about it later, explaining to him that I wasn't intentionally trying to leave John out, I really just wanted to do something nice for my husband.  My husband said he understood my point of view, but that is not how they're looking at it.  They still viewed it as me being disrespectful.\n\nI was still pretty upset that night as I was making dinner (I am also unemployed so I make dinner for us every night), so I decided to talk to them about it at dinner.  I was hoping that maybe it was a misunderstanding on John's part and I wanted to be extra clear with him specifically that I wasn't singling him out and just wanted to do something sweet for my husband.  After explaining my point of view, John said that regardless of my intentions, he still views bringing my husband food and excluding him from this as disrespectful.  My husband tries not to take a side in this, though he clearly thinks that John's logic is correct.\n\nI was in shock after hearing this.  I ended up going for a walk because I didn't want to add fuel to the fire.  I bake a lot because of my sweet tooth and oftentimes I do bring up a plate for both of them, this was the one exception where I wanted my husband to feel extra special.
