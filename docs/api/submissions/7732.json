I only knew my cousin and some friends on football team. It wasn't until summer after graduation that I was told that there were a couple of girls who were interested in me but didn't I guess have the courage to talk to me during the school year. the fiance was one of them. *Sidenote* I'm not that handsome but I do wash regularly, dress nicely, and according to my dad \"big boys are always in season\" (I'm 6'3 265lbs at the time) so I should expect this happening more frequently.\n\nNow I have issues and I decided to take advantage of my colleges free counseling Department and I started Therapy. I became friends with some of the individuals who also going to therapy as well and we joke bonded over our issues a little bit: \n\n\"oh I'm depressed\" \n\"oh I got trauma from my parents.\"  \nMine was \"I'm autistic and I'm trying to learn some coping mechanisms cause the ones I made as a kid are not working now as an adult.\" \n\nInsert Emily (27f), the fiance. We got to talking, realized we went to the same school, and hung out a few times. She said her therapist is telling her to try new things to the adjustment to college life as my mine told me. She suggested we try things together and I guess you can guess what we did \"together\". It only lasted 2 or 3 months but it got real intense real fast. My counselor specifically and very intensely told me that it is not what he meant (lol a little too late for that doc) and I should probably cut it off cause we're probably doing more bad than good. we end it. Now just FB friends.\n\nCurrent issue: My friend, more like Friend of a friend, Sean (27m) and i  are hanging out he tells me about this girl he's been seeing for like 4 years and he's finally popped the question. I gave him the obvious \"bro congratulations I'm so happy for you\" and then he described her  I'm like, \"the universe won't do me like that and not like this.\" Then he says her name And he describes a birthmark (yes weird) which confirms. So now I'm just like I have to say something but I Did tell him about the things we did together cuz we were still in contact and the descriptions were really really graphic. so if I tell him that it's the girl he's already popped the question too my fear is that its gonna be on sight. Yes its irrational but I'm sweating bullets at this point. In any case I forget cause I was so in a daze and I just barely continued the conversation and say nothing. Fast forward to the new year (2023 hoorah!) I get a message from 1 of our mutual high school friends Joe (28m) that I'm still actually pretty good friends with who tells me that I better Watch out cause Sean knows, thinks we were together behind his back, and NOW its in sight. I haven't heard from either him or Emily at this point but I know it's coming.

The issue is that he, according to this, seems to think:\n\n>thinks we were together behind his back\n\nWhich obviously isn't the case as you weren't and haven't been a 'thing' for a decade (long before he was in the picture).\n\nIf he can't handle her being with people before they were together, that's his problem and not yours.", "Tell him it was so long ago you weren't sure it was the same person, just someone with a similar name.

There's no reason for anybody to be sharing \"really really graphic\" descriptions of what they do in bed unless the other party is 100% ok with that.
