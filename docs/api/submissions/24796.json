It\u2019s okay if your sister didn\u2019t want to live that lifestyle long term, or wanting to go with your wife to the markets, but out of respect for the roof over her head, she should have followed the basic rules of the house when it came to separating recycling and composting.

That\u2019s all on her.", "NTA\n\nNo one would be able to treat my partner that way and stay in our home.  Neither friend nor family.   You can't control what others think or do.

It's not like it's hard to recycle or compost. Sure, maybe canning is overboard for her, but not wasting food? Having a leftover day? Not insulting your wife? These are pretty simple rules for normal people to follow.", "Your sister is clearly TA here.

Were you and your wife trying to make her compost *her own food* or yours?
