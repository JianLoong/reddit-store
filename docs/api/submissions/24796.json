You and your wife tried to show her ways to gain a community, be more financially independent and food secure, and be able to provide for herself and her kids during lean times.

It's one of those things that if your found out for not doing it, you're not only shamed by the community but you also have to pay a fine. \n\nKid's in daycare learn how to sort trash and alot of daycare have the own compost. Many daycares have their own mini gardens where they teach kids how to plant and sown small and easy to manage veggies. \n\nMy own daughter came home with a tomate plant and she is under 2. \nShe frequently trieds to over water it but she loves that thing. \n\nSo to me your sister sounds unhinged. None of your rules are even hard or complicated, just common sense. \n\nAnd honestly someone who is as low on money as your sister should be following your wife around with pen and paper taking notes on how to save money food wise. Many people don't realise how much money is throw away when it comes to food waste. \n\nSo no you're not tha asshole.

It\u2019s also really really hard to get by and people often tell you what to do with no idea how it\u2019s just not doable financially. \n\nI also believe and agree with what OPs wife does but I agree when someone is struggling unsolicited advice will feel like judgement and preaching and no one wants that, Esp when they\u2019re low. \n\nSister shouldn\u2019t have ruined the compost but I also think this is a sad situation especially for the kids.
