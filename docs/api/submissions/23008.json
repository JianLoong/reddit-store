It is about OP\u2019s way to approach this is creating a toxic work environment, and second, not one\u2019s problem does not mean it is the decent thing to work away and let one walk in 2am for 5 miles.\n\nEdit: my reply above is me not wanting OP to move the focus from his behavior saying she can have other options but actually he doesn\u2019t know if she can afford or not (yes, not his problem).\n\nEdit:  can we please focus on OP\u2019s behavior other than why she\u2019s not do that why she\u2019s not do this.  It is not relevant to the situation there.", "No, you got something out of it.", "Bull", "Well, 1/3 is still a minority. I just think jumping to sexual harassment was uncalled for either way though.", "So, how I see it is that he usually drives her and then, in her perspective, suddenly stopped. I think just giving her notice would have easily made him perfectly in the clear. Just saying \"after tonight, I won't be giving you a ride\" would have sufficed. But because he HAD been giving her rides up until this point, why wouldn't she expect a ride, as do the other coworkers? I fully get why he isn't and my argument isn't for him continuing to give her rides. My argument is for giving her notice before abruptly stopping BECAUSE of the safety concerns. That is the ONLY reason why he's an asshole for me.\n\nI would also say the same if it was a woman deciding to stop giving a coworker a ride, as well. If there were easy alternatives, I wouldn't say that. But it sounds like, especially in their neighbourhood, there's no easy alternatives (if there is, he needs to clarify; I think he made mention of Uber but I don't know if he's clarified if Uber is a safe alternative or not or if there's a lot of Uber drivers in the area) so it's either she stays at the warehouse or she walks to the station. I guess the alternative is that she stays at the warehouse, but again, the safety concerns is the main issue. \n\nJust telling her before her next shift would give her enough time to figure out another ride. If he hadn't been giving her consistent rides for an undetermined amount of time, if this was the first time she was asking, I ALSO wouldn't call him an asshole. But because he had been giving her rides, that's why I think he's a bit of an asshole. Not a major one, just enough of one to point out.", "If she has consistently been getting a lift with everyone else it's a pretty common assumption that she will continue to. She's been rude for not saying thank you, assuming she had a ride, etc. But I doubt everyone else asks every single shift for a ride. This seems to be routine. Everyone assumes they with ride together, OP assumes she won't ask. So OP should do the considerate thing and let her know ahead of time. Yes, this isn't required. But it's petty not to do so.\n\nOp had issue with being called petty. I was pointing out petty was an apt word to use. Asshole might also apply, but I'm not 100% sure.", "I think you need to reread the post. \n\n\nOP usually took the entire group home and decided last minute to call out everyone except her when he usually would right? Or maybe he doesn't usually call everyone's name out loud but decided this time to do so to make a point idk? If they had an arrangement it's a rude way to break it. \n\n\nHe also said it caused a scene because she understandably got upset.", "Seriously? Get fucked", "sure he was direct but was the other course, be passive aggressive? I didnt see any insults, just firmly setting a boundary. Or is he now committed forever to being a taxi", "I think it works both ways. lol", "Aside from her work ethic, OP has an issue with her lack of gratitude. I think walking 5 miles in the middle of the night/early morning is dangerous. I don\u2019t know why the coworker was treating the ride like she was doing him a favor. Consequences.", "Adding details when asked for them isn\u2019t changing the story lol.", "Why is likely because in these kinds of labor jobs where they are *already* short-staffed \"as all fuck\" they just don't *give* a fuck as long as the work is getting done, and I'd bet dollars to donuts that the supervisor she's been sweet on did/would take up for her.", "Gratitude is kissing ass? What planet do you live on? And you completely ignored the most important reason. But ok", "The supervisor that's into her can give her a ride. Also, OP is not stopping one or two people from staying with her and walking the five miles.", "Yes. Some other co-workers are loud", "I have never had a job that provides a shuttle. I have also always had to answer the question, do you have reliable transportation to work when you are scheduled?", "When I was the unpaid chauffeur, it caused a lot of stress (and expenses) for ME.  I was not reimbursed gas money by the people who demanded a free ride from me (one of who was my boss, so harder to say no). I was yelled at for not stopping at McDonald's so they could eat in my car (which I do not allow).\n\nThe next day, I dropped them all off at a train station and explained that that would be the extent of my chauffeur service.  I gave my notice the next week.", "Sounds like you really enjoy doing it too.", "Ok", "Um, she used to have other people to walk or wait with, but now they all have a ride, so it's not true that \"nothing changed\". You don't have to believe that should impact his decision, but claiming \"nothing changed\" denies reality.", "If he has been giving her a ride on a regular basis, he is her ride until he says otherwise. He's free to change it but at least give her some notice, even it's from one day to the next.", "Clearly the AH for how he handled it. You don\u2019t tell someone who you have been giving rides to before that you aren\u2019t allowing them anymore out of the blue. That\u2019s what changed. \n\nHe should have given her a ride and then said this is the last one, find your own transportation from here on out.", "If you read his post and comments, he said today was the last straw. She literally didn\u2019t do any work while her co-workers were pulling her weight. While short staffed.", "I mean I get your point about safety, but I find it ridiculous that coworkers are responsible for a woman's safety just because they gave her a ride to work before. Her transportation and safety issues are 100% hers.\n\nI'm a woman, and for my safety, I don't accept jobs that end at 2am, and I would never not have a car. Public transport, Uber, even taxis are not safe for women alone at night. But it is my job, or my family's job, to make sure I have a car or a ride. That way I won't be dependent on random coworkers I've managed to piss off that day. \n\nThe fact that this woman is just cavalierly counting on OP to give her a ride without confirming in advance means that she didn't plan responsibly for her own safety. It is not OP's responsibility to reach out to the coworker, the onus is on the coworker to reach out to her ride. I mean, what if OP had left a couple minutes prior to her making it to the parking lot? She would have been in the same dangerous situation and no one would be calling OP an AH.", "Wrong. If someone gives you a ride everyday, you do not assume it will happen in perpetuity, that would be rude and entitled. If you need the ride, you need to confirm everyday in advance. And you should repay the favor. You do not become entitled to the favor. \n\nI don't really care if OP is petty, I think it's a boss move to teach slacker/suck up a lesson in what happens when you're shitty to people doing you a favor.", "Cool. He offered them a ride, that\u2019s not making a scene. If she feels excluded, that\u2019s her problem", "OP never said it was an arrangement. Looks like he just offers rides everyday.", "Be direct in private before it's time to go home instead of being direct in front of other people right when it's time to leave, humiliating her and surprising her with the change at the last second.", "I am a manager facing short staffed.  You do know short staffed means manpower is the most valuable thing, right?  If I was his supervisor, you definitely right just get the job done, so the wise decision is to cut the woman off.   Still I am wanting to know what\u2019s difficulty OP is facing in the complaint.", "We understand that you don\u2019t like this woman, and we understand why, but you handled this situation unprofessionally and, frankly, immaturely. \n\nIf you have a work complaint, take it to higher ups. Putting this woman in an unsafe situation without prior warning to essentially teach her a lesson makes you an AH.", "So you're already convinced that you're NTA, then why come here and ask for a judgement?", "You created a big window for harm though. There's a big difference between a group of 3-5 people making it to the train together and one singular person out on their own", "It's not about no longer giving free rides, it's about how you went about telling her. Instead of letting her know beforehand that you aren't going to be giving her rides anymore, you embarrassed her in front of everyone and left her with no time to make alternate arrangements.\n\nIf you'd told her earlier then you wouldn't have been an asshole, but the way you did it and the fact that you left her on her own at 2am is why YTA.", "Hey man, you are off topic now.  OP is not expressing he\u2019s stress from giving the ride and money problem. Sorry for your experience tho.\n\nEdit: about that OP, if you are feeling the stress and money problem, we can definitely discuss here as well.", "OP literally said it would have cost them no time or money to drive their coworker to the station. Whilst the experience you had as an unpaid chauffeur sucks, it isn\u2019t the experience of OP.", "I did read the post and comments. I still think she deserves a heads up. Tell her at your lunch break at minimum. If it were me, I'd tell her after dropping her off that I wouldn't be doing it again so she knows when getting ready for the next shift, but I don't think that much heads up is needed. \n\nIf she didn't do anything ALL DAY LONG, OP probably knew by a couple hours into shift that they were annoyed. OP didn't decide at the moment she was putting her shoes on. They could have said something earlier and should have.\n\nSo yeah, go for it, don't give her a lift. But give her a heads up. Not doing so is petty. Maybe not asshole behavior. But definitely petty.", "I agree that it's her responsibility for getting home, but I just think the polite thing on his end (to be a bigger person) is just give her notice, even if it was at the beginning of the shift, so she could find ways to get home. He may be right in why he's doing what he's doing; he can also still be a bit of an asshole in the process. \n\nBut, like I said, there are other factors that could have easily made him in the clear for me. There were simple things that he could have done and he didn't. I agree, overall, I do. But I think because he already made the decision prior to not give her rides (and he's not obligated to), and he HAD been giving her rides prior, it's just the simple task in giving her notice (whether it's a shift's notice or telling her at the start of the shift) that changes my personal judgement. \n\nBut I think, had he not explained that there have been literal murders/violence every week/every other week, I might have also felt differently. Or if he explained he had had conversations about her behaviour before. Because it's unclear if she had any idea prior that her coworkers absolutely hate her. Maybe she should have realized, but there's just some vaugeness on OP's end to know if there were any prior conversations. Just give her some notice, even at the start of the shift, so she has time to call someone or leave early or ask someone else on that shift.", "I wonder if everyone asks for a ride every single day? \n\nI don't think she should have assumed. That's rude. Especially since she also didn't say thank you. But OP knows she assumes, so they should have brought it up ahead of time. \n\nI bring up the term petty because OP said they changed their tone after being called petty. I think being called petty was valid. Letting this be pushed back to the literal last minute, then making a scene, makes them an asshole IMO. This would likely have been avoided if OP just gave her a heads up. \n\nSure, technically OP OWES her nothing. But who owes anyone anything? She's an asshole for not doing her work, even though OP isn't the one who pays her to work. Some things are just common courtesy. Not doing them makes you petty or an asshole or just rude.", "Personally, I think he is since it sounds like he's giving her rides plenty of times before and this is the first time he's not. She feels excluded because she quite literally IS being excluded.\n\nMy point of view is that all he needed to do is give her notice, that's it. If he gave her notice, or if he hadn't been giving her rides before, he'd be 100% in the clear, no asshole detected in him.", "Ok not here to nitpick and argue with you over like slight wording. He doesn't say he offers every time either so let's not quibble over that aspect. Whether it's an explicit arrangement or not if you usually take the exact same group every single shift it becomes an implied arrangement and it's not cool to last minute boot someone with no warning at 2am \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc", "1.  OP is creating a toxic work environment by using private flavors to single the woman out.  This is my first impression.  What I am going to ask is did OP confront the woman directly and saying she\u2019s pulling everyone down and should get her shit together?  Why he\u2019s complaint was not working (he implied he filed complaint, he did not say he did, just replying why I think he didn\u2019t).  \n\n2. Not one\u2019s problem does not mean it is the decent thing to walk away.  No one, man or woman, should walk alone in 2am for 5 miles, god knows what will happen.   What if they faint in the way and no one is there till morning?", "It actually seems as though everyone hates her.\nNone of the other workers declined the offer and decided to walk instead?\nIt\u2019s only 5 miles that they are used to.\nHopefully the supervisor will arrange her transport after disrupting group morale like this.", "Well I\u2019m not gonna deny my friends rides", "Oh I see. Yeah I don't think OP should go out of his way to be a bigger person in this scenario. Sounds like a great way to get taken advantage of. \n\nTbh, I would be comfortable giving a coworker a ride once in a while just because, but I would get uncomfortable if I realized they had started to rely on me for their safety. That is too much pressure on me, and would make me rethink the whole friendship because why would I want friends that are so irresponsible and purposely dependent on me?\n\nAlso, if she didn't realize her coworkers hate her, that's on her.", "Just because OP is petty doesn't make it ok for the coworker to call this out while simultaneously demanding a favor. I would have changed my tone too.\n\nGiving rides to coworkers is NOT a common courtesy, it's a pretty big favor. My car is my personal space, I don't offer it to coworkers out of courtesy.", "She got excluded because she slacks off burdening her co-workers with more work while she plays around. Like I said, deserved", "Well. While she waits for the 8 am bus, she can reflect on why her co-workers dislike her", "Exactly. The supervisor that's into her can give her a ride. Also, OP is not stopping one or two people from staying with her and walking the five miles.", "So, as others have said, you clearly already feel justified. Why did you come here and ask since you\u2019re so sure you are correct? You\u2019re not, and you have put a woman in a dangerous situation since she now has nobody to walk with at 2:00 am since everyone else is getting a ride. Tbh, your reasons for not doing this are weak. It sounds like she somehow doesn\u2019t stroke your oversized ego enough and that rubs you the wrong way.", "Idk man, even if it\u2019s a person I dislike I\u2019d give them a lift to prevent a dangerous situation. That just seems like the easiest solution.\n\nAt the very least I would give them more of a heads up about their rides ending so they had more of a chance to arrange something else.", "I get that, but it sounds like he's already been giving her rides and giving her a heads up isn't getting taken advantage of (he already WAS), but just saying \"listen, I can't give you a ride after tonight, I'm only helping you out this last time but you will have to find other ways to get home\" or even \"hey, I can't give you a ride after shift, so you'll have to figure out alternatives to get home tonight\" is better than telling her right when everyone's leaving and there's less options for her to figure out her ride home after knowing she would be expecting a ride.\n\nLike I said, there are little things that could have been said or done that would change my judgement easily; I'm not 100% dedicated to my judgement if OP provides answers that have me switch my thinking.", "Ah, I see. We are arguing different points. I agree it is not common courtesy to give someone a ride. That's a very kind favor. I commend OP for doing that, many people wouldn't even if it was on their way home. \n\nThe common courtesy I'm talking about is giving the person a heads-up that you will no longer be giving them a ride, especially when everyone has been (even wrongfully) assuming they will be getting a ride. That is what I have issue with.", "That is not what exclusion is, at all.", "Yeah you're not wrong. OP is still TA though \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc", "> Idk man, even if it\u2019s a person I dislike I\u2019d give them a lift to prevent a dangerous situation. That just seems like the easiest solution.\n> \n> \n\nSo she can treat OP like trash and still get a free ride because she's a woman and women need to be protected at all costs?", "I mean I get that, but putting myself in OP's shoes, being so extra courteous to someone I don't like would make me feel like a pushover. And also, I would not feel comfortable having that conversation BEFORE giving the person a ride. Most I could do is tell them at the beginning of the shift \"I am not giving you a ride today.\" But this \"one last time thing\" leads to a very awkward, resentful car ride with a now ungrateful coworker. Like why should I have to deal with her mood in my car? \n\n Leaving coworker screwed for a ride unexpectedly is legitimate payback for slacking off and making me pick up your slack.\n\nEdit: just realized, problem with informing her at the beginning of the shift, is then she would have been pouting all shift. So leaving her and not informing her until right before you do it is the only way to not have to deal with coworker's bs today.", "I see. Yeah I still would not have risked telling her in advance, that just gives her chance to pout at you all shift.", "Okay buddy. So she didn\u2019t get excluded?", "OP is not TA \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
