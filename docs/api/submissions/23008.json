They mainly rely on public transit which isn\u2019t reliable when most of us ends our shift. Most of them used to walk 5 miles to the train station or stay at work for few more hours (unpaid). The train station is literally on the way to my second job and house, so I offer them rides. I drive a F-150 so the truck seats 5 people including myself. 3-5 people (including myself) usually clock out at 2 in the morning, so I drive everyone in my shift to the train station. I don\u2019t mind, my truck can fit them all and it\u2019s fun to drive with others. But there\u2019s this one woman I don\u2019t care for that much, she has a reputation for being lazy. While everyone would be working, she\u2019s usually in the office or outside speaking with the supervisor who\u2019s into her (I think). She also never thanked me or even says please, it\u2019s like she\u2019s entitled to a free ride. So all of us clock out at 2 am, I said out loud the names of the people and said come with me, I\u2019ll drop you guys off at the station. As we\u2019re walking outside, she comes up to me and says \u201cCan you drop me off? I\u2019ll be ready in few minutes, have to change my shoes\u201d. I said \u201csorry but from now on, I don\u2019t want to give you rides anymore. You should ask for a shift change\u201d. She got visually upset and talked about how dangerous the streets and how I\u2019m petty for not giving her a ride. I changed my tone and said \u201cenough, it\u2019s my truck. You can find your own way home, i\u2019m not the city bus\u201d. Caused a bit of a scene but my co-workers agreed with me, it\u2019s my truck, I can choose who to let in.", "created_utc": 1690196307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1587c1b/aita_for_excluding_a_coworker_when_i_was_giving_a/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There has been murders and other violent crimes, and it happens every other week. City bus doesn\u2019t come around until 8 am, so it\u2019s either a 6 hour wait or 1 hour walk through dangerous streets. It would have costed me nothing, in time or in money. I just didn\u2019t want someone who takes advantage of everyone and gets away with not working and burdening everyone else. Whenever she\u2019s in, we have to pick up her slack.

But it\u2019s everyone, and you\u2019re taking everyone else. You used to include her. You\u2019re now actively excluding her when it\u2019s no extra effort to include her. AND by dropping off everyone else, you\u2019re removing her 2am safety net of being able to walk in a group instead of on her own.", "YTA not for refusing her a ride, but the way in which you did it. You could've spoken to her privately and told her that you won't be dropping her at the train station anymore so that she could arrange something else. Instead, you specifically called out the names of people you were giving a ride to, waited for her to ask and then was rude to her in front of everyone. Fair enough, you don't like and don't want to give her a ride, you didn't need to be a dick about it though.", "NTA this sub loves to say no is a complete sentence and it is your truck after all.

It is pretty dangerous for someone to be walking that distance on their own in the middle of the night, but I suppose it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But the way you did that is completely AH material.\n\nInstead of talking to her and saying you wouldn't give her a ride anymore, you embarrassed her in front of everyone. And if this is something that has become a custom then it's natural for her to be expecting it on that day (because you said nothing before) and you just left her hanging.\n\nBecause of the way you did that (and also because how much she works shouldn't affect this) and will go with YTA.", "YTA\n\nHer job performance has nothing to do with getting a ride. I firmly believe no one is entitled to a ride, its a privilege and not everyone at my job will get that offer. You don't like them, you don't want to give them a ride, fine. But, \"she's lazy at work,\" isn't a good reason for me.\n\nI also don't make a thing out of it and loudly call for my co-workers who I do give rides to draw attention to the fact I'm doing it, just to have an opportunity to tell off the people I won't give a ride to. \n\nWhat you're doing is creating a toxic work environment.", "At the end of the day its your car but cmon man you really gonna let her walk 5 miles at 2am cause you dont like her? Dont be so petty, Shit man atleast make her pay for gas money or sum like that\n\nYTA", "ESH.\n\nIt's your truck, and you give rides to whoever you want.\n\nBut you didn't have to make a public spectacle out of it.  \n\nAnd she should learn to grease the wheels a little with some please and thank yous.", "YTA\nI agree with some of the other commenters. You definitely don\u2019t need to give her a ride if you don\u2019t want to but the right thing would have been to talk to her especially since you seem to have taken her along before. So letting her know in a one-on-one that this would be the last time you take her to the satiation since you personally do not feel like you get along. \n\nBut letting her spontaneously go in the middle of the night and making it very public simply bec you disagree with her work ethic (or that the supervisor might have a thing for her) is pretty douchey.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had co-workers before where they don\u2019t pull their own weight and cause more work on others. You said you don\u2019t want to give her a ride, she escalated and accused you of being petty.", "Why are you giving co workers a ride? Is it to help them out or for the clout. I get you don\u2019t like her and she\u2019s a bit lazy as you say but at 2am at night you\u2019re leaving a woman make her own way home even though it wouldn\u2019t be putting you out of your way. Cmon man. She should\u2019ve been more grateful for sure but you dealt with it in a really bad way. Your coworkers agreed with you cos they don\u2019t want to rock the boat and end up without a ride too. They could be calling you a pr|\u20ack behind your back for all you know.", "NTA. You\u2019re a guy with a truck, not public transit or a $0 Uber. You get the final say on who rides in it. And like you said, this wasn\u2019t some one-time situation where her car was in the shop, this is her assuming you\u2019ll be her ride every day.", "NTA.\n\nPeople tend to get the treatment they give out. You do not have to give a ride to someone who never says thank you. Or anyone, really.\n\nI don't agree with the other commenters about your method. I think there is a benefit to being that blunt--it shows that your decision is irrevocable.\n\nI suppose I think you should have given her a reason.", "He can choose who he wants to let in his OWN truck. It\u2019s not a public bus. And if she\u2019s a good person, people would have volunteered to stay back to walk with her.", "I give them a ride because it\u2019s on the way and some of them are my friends. No one likes her at work because her slacking off means more work for us. Whenever she\u2019s here, we have to pick up her slack. Today was the last straw, we were short staffed to hell and while everyone worked like dogs, she\u2019s sitting in the office with the supervisor."]}
