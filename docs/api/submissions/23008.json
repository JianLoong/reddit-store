OP didn\u2019t even talk to her, she approached him. She accused him of being petty. She made the scene and embarrassed herself.", "Projection I\u2019m assuming. Or never worked in an environment where one person slacking off means more work for others", "How about NO is a complete sentence and it's only because she's a woman that you are saying this. Stinks of sexism.", "I didn\u2019t make a scene, she came to me when we were walking to the parking lot. I said I don\u2019t want to give her rides and that I was sorry. She called me petty", "I did decline. I said \u201csorry I don\u2019t want to give you anymore rides, maybe change your shift schedule if you need a car\u201d something along that line. She said I was being petty, that\u2019s when I changed my tone.", "We do discuss it during work hours and it leads to no where, we brought in the union. I\u2019m not retaliating against her, I\u2019m just not going to interact with her outside of work related matters", "Tbh, she did move one pallet into the truck", "He didn\u2019t go out of his way. He literally ignored her lmao", "He didn\u2019t make a scene. She came to him lmao", "I think you need to improve on your reading comprehension. I\u2019m not even going to bother lmao", "She's not owed a free ride but as a human person she deserve a little politeness and not to get humiliated in public.\n\nAlso you can do things for people not cause they are owed but cause you're a nice person.", "We all owe each other a basic level of politeness. She's not owed a lift, but a polite no would have been better.", "Everyone deserves a certain level of respect and dignity.", "Yeah, one one hand I get it. Who wants to do favors for someone that acts entitled and rude about it. On the other hand this is much bigger than just not getting a ride. And putting someone\u2019s safety at risk is a major no no! If it was only not giving a ride, fine. But it\u2019s not. And also if something does happen to her, because she is walking, alone, in the middle of the night, Op will most likely feel guilty and will have to live with that on their conscious.", "This is what I was thinking as well.\n\nFor this reason, I probably would have spoken to her quietly and told her that he does not want to give her rides anymore because she shows no appreciation. She has been treating him like a free bus. If she apologized and showed a change of attitude, I would take her again.", "Again he's not the AH for not wanting to give her a ride. He's an AH for how he did it. Had he told her 'tomorrow I'm not giving you a ride\" he wouldn't have been an AH.", "Bot", "Oh, I don't know. I've worked with people like her over the years. People who somehow manage to do sod all and the rest of the team gets to do extra because they're not pulling their weight so I can understand OP not wanting to do her any favours. I'm not sure if I would refuse to give her a lift but I can understand why someone wouldn't want to go out of their way for her especially if their 8 hours has been made more challenging through her laziness. But I think your point is valid.", "One of those afraid to ask questions... but what is ESH?", "Or he may be sexually harassing her? She might not like spending all of that time with him but feel like she has no choice in the matter if she wants to keep her job. Now she\u2019s doubly isolated because her coworkers have iced her out. \n\nI\u2019m offering this opinion from the perspective of the odd woman out, who\u2019s worked in a totally male dominated field. Especially in warehouse or other physically demanding work, it can be a challenge.", "She's riding the D-Train to Pound Town.", "The Bologna Express", "Maybe all of you individually bring it to your boss that she\u2019s not working as hard as the rest of you. Do it via email so it\u2019s documented and CC HR or someone above your boss. If you say he\u2019s into her he\u2019ll do nothing if only he hears the complaint. If someone higher up knows and the complaint is from several staff something will have to be done. Stand up for yourselves.", "Yes OP, stand up for yourself in a proper way.  If your colleagues\u2019 performance is not good and affecting others, you should solve it through the company channel, like HR, also the supervisor you \u201cthink\u201d have a thing on her may actually not true.  If your manager is half good at his job, you and your other colleagues complaint together will have an effect.   You can definitely solve this at a more professional way but you singled her out like this is creating a toxic work environment.  You are dealing it a petty way.", "INFO: This seems like a problem the supervisor is enabling. Have you spoken to him about it? It's not like she's shirking off behind his back.", "Do you know why she is sitting in the Office? How do you know she even wants to be there? Or that she doesn\u2019t have a real reason to be there?", "How does that have anything to do with the situation at hand? Your coworker being lazy means you get to embarrass them in front of everyone? Have you ever heard of professionalism?", "I'd still go with a soft YTA. She doesn't know why she's being excluded, so it'll feel just like bullying and there's also zero chance for her to 'fix' the issue. But I'm not convinced she'd want to try if she knew. \n\nI guess this is the case where YTA, but you did what's best for everyone.. A justified asshole basically.", "Not really what you said originally", "Was there space for her and was she the only colleague who clocked out at that time that you didn\u2019t give a ride too?    If so, then yeah it\u2019s your truck and you can give whoever you want a ride-  but picky on one person going to the same place and saying no is some petty high school bullying bullshit:  Yta.\n If who work attititude is causing you problems speak to her about it.", "Or the supervisor you think might be in to her.", "You said they cannot afford car, so why you think she can afford Uber?", "You're out of your mind BONKERS if you think people would willingly walk 5 miles after an entire shift at 2am when they have a much better option.", "Cos you are mate", "Just because it's not said out loud, does not mean it did not impact the verdict in any way. Biases on this sub can really be something else. In one moment men will be judged for not treating women like someone who needs protection and in another moment they will be judged for not providing protection. \n\nThe other day husband was judged for not wanting his pregnant wife to go to trip inn Mexico without him, here man is judged for treating coworker like independent adult.", "Excellent points, really excellent points.\n\nDown vote me you bellend blue haired incel losers of vague gender.\n\nI wear my down votes like a crown of thorns!", "Nah, you can\u2019t admit to being petty and then keep adding to your narrative as the YTA votes come in. That\u2019s BS.", "People feel sorry for her because she's a woman in what sounds like a male dominated field. So they immediately jump to \"what if the supervisor is harassing her.\" If she can't handle her own transportation she shouldn't have accepted the job. And it's really rich of her to expect a favor after slacking off all day. NTA.", "Way to assume things.\n\nThe only people making this sexist are the ones demanding it is. \n\nIt's called workplace conduct and common courtesy. If I needed to have that conversation I would have done it privately.", "You should have talked to her ahead of time instead of as you were leaving. That is petty.", "And it took 8 hours? Hope she didn\u2019t pull a hammy", "He made it a point to be a dick with his words. That's what I was referring to. He could have said, \"I'm sorry, there's no more room.\" And walked away.", "He said out loud all the names excluding hers so there must have been a good number more than the 4 of them there otherwise he wouldn't need to right? To call all the names out loud and say \"come with me\" \ud83e\udd28", "I would say he did make a scene because he could have not, you know, yelled out who was allowed in his truck beforehand. I think, when he did that, it caused her to realize she wasn't being included in the carpooling situation as she usually was.\n\nHe started it by yelling out the names of the coworkers he was going to drive to the station.", "Shes already acting entitled, isn\u2019t appreciative, and causes problems at work. He shouldnt have to", "Everyone sucks here. It's a vote people make when you believe people on both sides of an issue are an asshole.", "everyone sucks here", "Everyone Sucks Here, as opposed to picking one AH", "A lot of assumptions here.", "Bologna *", "Eh I would start just the boss and escalate if no action taken.", "Who said we didn\u2019t file a complaint?", "We complained to the weekend supervisor but he either ignores it or tells us that it\u2019s not our business. Main manager always takes the supervisor\u2019s side. One of my co-workers contacted the union representative, we\u2019re going to have a meeting next week.", "Usually just jokes around and shares videos with each other. Most of the time she\u2019s scrolling her phone while he does paperwork and manages people. Her job is to be an order selector.", "She must be really dumb if she doesn\u2019t know why she was excluded.", "Well then maybe she can reflect on her behavior on her 5 mile walk and wonder why she is being excluded and why their is a union complaint against her", "Who said we haven\u2019t filed a complaint? It\u2019s a union job, takes time", "That is not my problem.", "Part of having a job is that you have reliable transportation to and from work. Expecting handouts is not reliable transportation", "What do you think he is an unpaid chauffeur?", "I'm one of the YTA votes. Nothing to do with her being a woman. He's an AH for how he handled the situation and for leaving her with no ride at 2 am alone and without any time to make other plans.", "What?", "Should have clarified that a good 1/3rd of the workers here are women \ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s also common courtesy to do your damn job and not burden others", "You wouldn't say y t a if the worker was a man.", "Why? He\u2019s not harming her, he\u2019s not harassing her. He\u2019s just ignoring her and wants nothing to do with her.", "She didn't ask until he was leaving. You can't have it both ways. OP is allowed to be petty, that doesn't make him an AH.", "Looks like he offered them a ride. That\u2019s not causing a scene.", "She wasn\u2019t invited because she slacked off and other people had to pull her weight. Justified", "Thank you for the response and the extra clarification for it's use in the sub.\n\nI had just assume it was a esssshhh axkward. Haha.", "Thank you.", "Thank you", "Ok, you did, to who and why it is not working?", "Seems like your story is changing, my dude.", "You filed a formal complaint against her and she still wants a lift from you?!   Does she know?  Probably relevant information.", "So your solution is not giving her rides?", "You really sound *delightful*.", "Guys, please follow the flow here,  ppl saying OP let the woman walk alone in 2am for 5 miles,  OP replied: well she can get Uber, I then ask you think she can afford a Uber ? It seems not possible for her, then OP: not my business.  I am not saying OP needs to take her because that\u2019s definitely his truck.  I guess I am just trying to say OP gave reply just to move the focus from he let a woman walk in 2am for 5 miles.  Of cause at the end, like OP said, it is definitely not his problem, I understand, adult fend for themselves.", "Huh?  What do you mean?", "She didn\u2019t have a ride to begin with, nothing changed.\n\nOP isn\u2019t the staff bus, she only received a ride as a courtesy and her work ethic ended that courtesy.\n\nClearly NTA.", "Bull.", "Telling her ahead of time allows her to make accommodations. Purposefully waiting until the literal last minute is rude and does negativity impact her. Sure, they technically don't have to give her advanced notice. But that makes them an asshole.\n\nI'm not saying she isn't also rude. Just pointing out OP was indeed \"petty\" since they had issue with the use of the word.\n\nEta: it also is far more unsafe for her to walk alone at 2 am vs walking with a group. OP is not directly harming her, but is putting her in an unsafe position.", "And your argument was that he didn't make a scene, I'm just explaining that he did.\n\nWhat you're trying to argue now is a completely different point.", "you're welcome!", "What\u2019s wrong with me not giving free rides to people I dislike? I\u2019m not harming them, simply not helping them.", "He does, doesn\u2019t he?", "Yeah, I guess it\u2019s from the thanks I get for dropping off my buddies after work"]}
