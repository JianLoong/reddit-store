It is about OP\u2019s way to approach this is creating a toxic work environment, and second, not one\u2019s problem does not mean it is the decent thing to walk away and let one walk in 2am for 5 miles.\n\nEdit: my reply above is me not wanting OP to move the focus from his behavior saying she can have other options but actually he doesn\u2019t know if she can afford or not (yes, not his problem).\n\nEdit:  can we please focus on OP\u2019s behavior other than why she\u2019s not do that why she\u2019s not do this.  It is not relevant to the situation there.\n\nEdit: yes, she sucks as a co-worker and I would sack her if there was no improvement after OP\u2019s filed complaint (really, OP what\u2019s the difficulty you facing about that complaint).", "No, you got something out of it.", "Bull", "Well, 1/3 is still a minority. I just think jumping to sexual harassment was uncalled for either way though.", "So, how I see it is that he usually drives her and then, in her perspective, suddenly stopped. I think just giving her notice would have easily made him perfectly in the clear. Just saying \"after tonight, I won't be giving you a ride\" would have sufficed. But because he HAD been giving her rides up until this point, why wouldn't she expect a ride, as do the other coworkers? I fully get why he isn't and my argument isn't for him continuing to give her rides. My argument is for giving her notice before abruptly stopping BECAUSE of the safety concerns. That is the ONLY reason why he's an asshole for me.\n\nI would also say the same if it was a woman deciding to stop giving a coworker a ride, as well. If there were easy alternatives, I wouldn't say that. But it sounds like, especially in their neighbourhood, there's no easy alternatives (if there is, he needs to clarify; I think he made mention of Uber but I don't know if he's clarified if Uber is a safe alternative or not or if there's a lot of Uber drivers in the area) so it's either she stays at the warehouse or she walks to the station. I guess the alternative is that she stays at the warehouse, but again, the safety concerns is the main issue. \n\nJust telling her before her next shift would give her enough time to figure out another ride. If he hadn't been giving her consistent rides for an undetermined amount of time, if this was the first time she was asking, I ALSO wouldn't call him an asshole. But because he had been giving her rides, that's why I think he's a bit of an asshole. Not a major one, just enough of one to point out.", "If she has consistently been getting a lift with everyone else it's a pretty common assumption that she will continue to. She's been rude for not saying thank you, assuming she had a ride, etc. But I doubt everyone else asks every single shift for a ride. This seems to be routine. Everyone assumes they with ride together, OP assumes she won't ask. So OP should do the considerate thing and let her know ahead of time. Yes, this isn't required. But it's petty not to do so.\n\nOp had issue with being called petty. I was pointing out petty was an apt word to use. Asshole might also apply, but I'm not 100% sure.", "I think you need to reread the post. \n\n\nOP usually took the entire group home and decided last minute to call out everyone except her when he usually would right? Or maybe he doesn't usually call everyone's name out loud but decided this time to do so to make a point idk? If they had an arrangement it's a rude way to break it. \n\n\nHe also said it caused a scene because she understandably got upset.", "Seriously?

Public transport, Uber, even taxis are not safe for women alone at night. But it is my job, or my family's job, to make sure I have a car or a ride. That way I won't be dependent on random coworkers I've managed to piss off that day. \n\nThe fact that this woman is just cavalierly counting on OP to give her a ride without confirming in advance means that she didn't plan responsibly for her own safety. It is not OP's responsibility to reach out to the coworker, the onus is on the coworker to reach out to her ride. I mean, what if OP had left a couple minutes prior to her making it to the parking lot? She would have been in the same dangerous situation and no one would be calling OP an AH.", "Wrong. If someone gives you a ride everyday, you do not assume it will happen in perpetuity, that would be rude and entitled. If you need the ride, you need to confirm everyday in advance.

Tell her at your lunch break at minimum. If it were me, I'd tell her after dropping her off that I wouldn't be doing it again so she knows when getting ready for the next shift, but I don't think that much heads up is needed. \n\nIf she didn't do anything ALL DAY LONG, OP probably knew by a couple hours into shift that they were annoyed. OP didn't decide at the moment she was putting her shoes on. They could have said something earlier and should have.\n\nSo yeah, go for it, don't give her a lift. But give her a heads up. Not doing so is petty. Maybe not asshole behavior. But definitely petty.", "I agree that it's her responsibility for getting home, but I just think the polite thing on his end (to be a bigger person) is just give her notice, even if it was at the beginning of the shift, so she could find ways to get home. He may be right in why he's doing what he's doing; he can also still be a bit of an asshole in the process. \n\nBut, like I said, there are other factors that could have easily made him in the clear for me. There were simple things that he could have done and he didn't. I agree, overall, I do. But I think because he already made the decision prior to not give her rides (and he's not obligated to), and he HAD been giving her rides prior, it's just the simple task in giving her notice (whether it's a shift's notice or telling her at the start of the shift) that changes my personal judgement. \n\nBut I think, had he not explained that there have been literal murders/violence every week/every other week, I might have also felt differently. Or if he explained he had had conversations about her behaviour before. Because it's unclear if she had any idea prior that her coworkers absolutely hate her. Maybe she should have realized, but there's just some vaugeness on OP's end to know if there were any prior conversations. Just give her some notice, even at the start of the shift, so she has time to call someone or leave early or ask someone else on that shift.", "I wonder if everyone asks for a ride every single day? \n\nI don't think she should have assumed. That's rude. Especially since she also didn't say thank you. But OP knows she assumes, so they should have brought it up ahead of time. \n\nI bring up the term petty because OP said they changed their tone after being called petty. I think being called petty was valid. Letting this be pushed back to the literal last minute, then making a scene, makes them an asshole IMO. This would likely have been avoided if OP just gave her a heads up. \n\nSure, technically OP OWES her nothing. But who owes anyone anything? She's an asshole for not doing her work, even though OP isn't the one who pays her to work. Some things are just common courtesy. Not doing them makes you petty or an asshole or just rude.", "Personally, I think he is since it sounds like he's giving her rides plenty of times before and this is the first time he's not.

If he gave her notice, or if he hadn't been giving her rides before, he'd be 100% in the clear, no asshole detected in him.", "Ok not here to nitpick and argue with you over like slight wording. He doesn't say he offers every time either so let's not quibble over that aspect.

OP is creating a toxic work environment by using private flavors to single the woman out.  This is my first impression.  What I am going to ask is did OP confront the woman directly and saying she\u2019s pulling everyone down and should get her shit together?  Why he\u2019s complaint was not working (he implied he filed complaint, he did not say he did, just replying why I think he didn\u2019t).  \n\n2.

Yeah I don't think OP should go out of his way to be a bigger person in this scenario. Sounds like a great way to get taken advantage of. \n\nTbh, I would be comfortable giving a coworker a ride once in a while just because, but I would get uncomfortable if I realized they had started to rely on me for their safety. That is too much pressure on me, and would make me rethink the whole friendship because why would I want friends that are so irresponsible and purposely dependent on me?\n\nAlso, if she didn't realize her coworkers hate her, that's on her.", "Just because OP is petty doesn't make it ok for the coworker to call this out while simultaneously demanding a favor.

You\u2019re not, and you have put a woman in a dangerous situation since she now has nobody to walk with at 2:00 am since everyone else is getting a ride.

We are arguing different points. I agree it is not common courtesy to give someone a ride. That's a very kind favor. I commend OP for doing that, many people wouldn't even if it was on their way home. \n\nThe common courtesy I'm talking about is giving the person a heads-up that you will no longer be giving them a ride, especially when everyone has been (even wrongfully) assuming they will be getting a ride.

And also, I would not feel comfortable having that conversation BEFORE giving the person a ride. Most I could do is tell them at the beginning of the shift \"I am not giving you a ride today.\" But this \"one last time thing\" leads to a very awkward, resentful car ride with a now ungrateful coworker. Like why should I have to deal with her mood in my car? \n\n Leaving coworker screwed for a ride unexpectedly is legitimate payback for slacking off and making me pick up your slack.\n\nEdit: just realized, problem with informing her at the beginning of the shift, is then she would have been pouting all shift. So leaving her and not informing her until right before you do it is the only way to not have to deal with coworker's bs today.", "I see.

Now she is alone, and the reason is you offered the group rides and are now denying her. And it isn't some 5 min walk, it's 5 MILES. So what, an hour? Or more? Companies legitimately have policies where employees leaving buildings late night cannot walk out the building alone. Yours may or may not, but the point is it's recognized that anyone walking alone at night, especially at 2am, is endangered. In this situation, you're the cause of that endangerment.\n\nIt's still your truck and they aren't entitled to rides, but now it kinda feels like its become more than that.
