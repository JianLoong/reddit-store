I hope y\u2019all are well, anyway\u2026this happened sometime last year but I am asking again because of some issues. I am on my phone, so I\u2019m sorry if there are formatting issues :/\n\nLast year I was living in university accommodation. I was rooming with a girl I was friends with, and we were close enough that I didn\u2019t mind cooking for her (there were 2 other girls as well but we didn\u2019t know them).\n\nI like to cook, it\u2019s healthier and cheaper once you know what options you have and I think I\u2019m decent. Being the oldest girl, I grew up cooking for my family once both of my parents started working, so I\u2019m not too good at cooking for just one person. I offered plates to my friend, especially after seeing she didn\u2019t eat often and when she did it was takeout. I felt bad for her and obviously because we\u2019re friends and living together I didn\u2019t mind sharing my food with her. I like cooking for people I care about. \n\nOne day I came home really tired, she was rummaging through the kitchen. I asked how she was and what she was doing, she said she was cooking. I felt really lazy and asked if I could eat with her. \n\n\u201cOf course, what are you going to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what are you making?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust some pasta.\u201d It felt a little rude to just assume, and wasn\u2019t really sure by her first answer so I asked if I could have some since I couldn\u2019t be bothered cooking today. \n\nShe stared at me kinda blankly and asked why she should share her pasta with me. I was shocked, at this point we had been living together for 4 going on 5 months and I had cooked everyday, which for the most part she gladly accepted.\n\nToo tired to argue, I just ordered takeout and ate in my room. \n\nI caught a cold soon after and my mother brought me chicken soup and fruit. Wrapped up in my blanket, I went to warm up some soup when my roommate came out and asked what I was doing. Then she asked if she could have some, since she hadn\u2019t eaten that day. \n\n\u201cWhy should I share with you?\u201d I replied back. She was a bit shocked and scoffed at me.\n\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve just said no.\u201d I admit, I was being petty, but I thought this was a bit ironic. \n\n\u201cI asked if I could have some of your pasta and thats what you said to me.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to share with you.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know, but I have shared with you these past few months and you couldn\u2019t even give me some pasta.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem, I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d I was angry by this point and went back into my room. \n\nIt was a hard rest of the year. I know i\u2019m not entitled to have her share with me, but I assumed as friends, me asking once wouldn\u2019t hurt after all the times I shared with her.\n\nI live with my best friend and another good friend and we\u2019ve never had this issue. However, now shes telling mutual friends I was a bitch to live with and that I\u2019m a leech.

Like you said \"It was a hard rest of the year.\" You have to live with this person. Even if she's in the wrong, it's probably better to handle it diplomatically and just politely decline. No need to rub in her face that she's a hypocrite. I'm sure it felt good in the moment, but was it worth having an antagonistic relationship with your roommate for the rest of the year?", "NTA but this happened last year, why bringing this up now?", "ESH\n\nThat\u2019s not a normal request unless you guys are already in the habit of sharing meals and cooking for each other. The way you asked was also weird. Basically food is usually one of those things that is offered to roommates but not requested if you\u2019re not sharing groceries. The fact that she\u2019s bitching about you to friends suggest there was more going on there. I doubt she\u2019s referring to just one request for her to give you her food.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n\"Same energy, B. Samesies!\"", "NTA i could have understand the pasta reaction at first if she already statted cooking and just made enough for herself because she didn't thought OP would be at home. But she just didn\u2019t want to share. Still she feels entitled to food OP cooks. Some people are just takers. They use people and never give back. For this people you shouldn't feel bad to say \"no\".", "Definitely NTA if anything she is the terrible one to live with and she is a leech", "Agreed! I\u2019d tell the people she talking to and set the record straight. Shes a taker - OP fed the roommate for months, and asked for pasta (I think many of us can agree, one of the most basic meals), and the roommate couldn\u2019t be bothered to share? OP was right for setting a boundary after that and would be fine to tell others the truth so they don\u2019t give to a taker.", "Especially the bit about her calling OP a leech. The girl has that backwards.", "I agree ! And now apparently a liar telling everyone I\u2019m a leech \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "I think so too !", "Oh yes, my brothers can cook as well. I didn\u2019t cook all the time and mostly just helped out my mother while my brothers worked outside. I did cook all by myself, but that was my last two years of high school and never during exam periods. Parentfication is real tho and a good reminder !", "Tbh no ! I agree, very stupid hill (more like a mound) to die on but yes I felt very good in the moment. I did try talking to her after but she didn\u2019t want to so\u2026i just left the situation as is and moved in w/ my best friend and my other friend.", "Should call her out.. The nerve of her.. Nta", "If the question was \"is my roommate TA\", the answer would be definitely yes. But your case is more complicated. I suppose my opinion will be unpopular, but actually you yourself offered her your help, she didn't ask, she didn't indicated she need it, it was totally your decision, you did it the way that was easiest for you, you did it when you anyway cooked more than you needed, as you're not used to cook for one. And therefore you feel she had obligation to help you not returning your courtesy (when and how it is convinient to her), but exactly the way you want it and the moment you decided you need it. It is not really fair. And you really acted as if it was her obligation to share her food just because you indicated you wanted it. If your roommate wasn't TA, she will have to share or feel bad about not sharing even it is the only food she has for several days. I think that you either help only when asked (and you can expect the same, if it is possible) or help the way you do it out of wish to help not expecting something in turn (and it is strange to expect from someone who can't feed herself to feed you). You can also set some rules for helping each other (like i cook - you give most part of money), but it is something you discuss before starting to act.", "NTA", " NTA \nYou did nothing wrong \ntell her that you don\u2019t care that she didn\u2019t want to share it just makes her look shitty because she\u2019s been leeching off your cooking for months and never complained but you asked for something small in return for that kindness and she went nuclear \nGoing as far as to tell other people dumb shit like that. I\u2019d go make a poster that says \u201c this person age my food everyday for so and so months and couldn\u2019t give me a plate of pasta, then decided to tell everyone I was a leech when I refused to give her food again, have fun with her to her next roommate \u201c \nand then have a nice chat with the RA", "NTA she\u2019s calling you a leech for asking for pasta one time when she\u2019s been having your food almost every day? Wtf", "I respect this opinion because i totally understand where I was a bit rude and petty. But no, I never asked her for anything besides this one time. I didn\u2019t even ask her to clean, though she rarely did. You\u2019re just gonna have to take my word for that tho haha. Totally understand the habit part, it might\u2019ve been unusual for her to share. The friends I live with now have no problems with it and we take turns, so yea i suppose so!! thank you for your input", "Thank you ! I totally understand and I appreciate your kindness in explaining, i definitely think that i just thought it was unspoken and that i shouldn\u2019t feel everyone does the same. We don\u2019t live together anymore, so there isn\u2019t a need to discuss anything and my friends i live w/ now have similar\u2026values im going to say because i can\u2019t think of anything better. I think I am going to talk to her about it when I get the chance, because either way i dont appreciate her telling people im a leech. thank you so much for your input."]}
