We live a very minimalistic life so I curated everything in that registry to best suit my family, aesthetics, and necessities. Items that are versatile/ multifunctional and that can be used throughout his childhood and teenage life. Everything in that registry was well thought out! My MIL, however, doesn't follow this minimalist life style. Even still, she asked for my baby registry as she intended to help with the baby's expenditures. In my mind, I thought that meant she'd just put the items I picked out in her cart and proceed to buy them...I was wrong. She merely wanted to see what I wanted as suggestions and bought totally different items, designs and accessories. She bought my unborn child a green John Deere Walker when it wasn't in the registry. I politely told her she should just keep it at her house for when we come visit. She then proceeded to buy more items that were not in the registry to which I declined yet again. I may seem extreme ungrateful but truthfully, in my own opinion, we make registries solely to not waste people's generosity and to give people an option to gift us voluntarily something that we will need and use for years to come. However, my MIL doesn't share this sentiment and I don't appreciate her not recognizing that I made that baby registry for a reason. Regardless, I know my MIL's intentions aren't malicious, and that she's just doing what she thinks is best for her first grandson but sometimes I just wished she'd consider our feelings as well, you know?\n\nSo am I the asshole for rejecting my MIL's gifts?", "created_utc": 1701649051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18a7kt5/aitafor_rejecting_my_mils_gifts/", "score": 515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't understand why MIL asked about the registry and then bought stuff that is off-registry. I agree, the whole point of one is to let people know what you would appreciate as a gift. Not to demand certain items, but to let them know what you want/need. My former MIL would buy my child stuff that I had no room (or reason) to store and I would just nod and smile and say something like, \"How wonderful. *Child* will very much enjoy playing/using this when we come to visit. Thank you for thinking of this so we don't have to bring toys/things back and forth.\" The message was generally received well.

Turns out babies have the world\u2019s shortest attention span. There were months when moving the child from one cheap-plastic-toy to another was all we did all day long to keep him occupied.

My MIL got us a high chair with a ridiculously large base and temperamental tray, which I hated using and ended up donating before LO was 6 months old.

We live a very minimalistic life so I curated everything in that registry to best suit my family, aesthetics, and necessities. Items that are versatile/ multifunctional and that can be used throughout his childhood and teenage life. Everything in that registry was well thought out! My MIL, however, doesn't follow this minimalist life style. Even still, she asked for my baby registry as she intended to help with the baby's expenditures. In my mind, I thought that meant she'd just put the items I picked out in her cart and proceed to buy them...I was wrong. She merely wanted to see what I wanted as suggestions and bought totally different items, designs and accessories. She bought my unborn child a green John Deere Walker when it wasn't in the registry. I politely told her she should just keep it at her house for when we come visit. She then proceeded to buy more items that were not in the registry to which I declined yet again. I may seem extreme ungrateful but truthfully, in my own opinion, we make registries solely to not waste people's generosity and to give people an option to gift us voluntarily something that we will need and use for years to come. However, my MIL doesn't share this sentiment and I don't appreciate her not recognizing that I made that baby registry for a reason. Regardless, I know my MIL's intentions aren't malicious, and that she's just doing what she thinks is best for her first grandson but sometimes I just wished she'd consider our feelings as well, you know?\n\nSo am I the asshole for rejecting my MIL's gifts?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There are lots of reasons, and lots of good reasons, why people should stick to registres and buy the actual items offered. Take a car seat or pram for example: buy the wrong car seat and it might have a different safety rating and not be certified for side impact, or it might not be compatible with the rest of the travel system. Buy the wrong pram and it might not work with the car seat, it might be too heavy for the apartment stairs or too light for the country dog walks. Buying the wrong colour isn't the end of the world, but these other reasons based on make or model would really mess up the parents' plans and make their lives harder. Buying additional useful items based on personal experience is a bit of a different kettle of fish, but should be done in conjunction with gifts you know they definitely want, and also in the knowledge that a grandparent buying for first grandchild is going to have knowledge a couple decades out of date at best, and SO much regarding safety and recommendations has changed in that time, and the grandparents are a) unlikely have done the research the new parents have, and b) to still hold onto ideals from when they were raised and when they raised their kid(s) - for example, my dad criticised me for not washing my baby daily because 'it's fun' and also raised his eyes when I said we were just using water in his (weekly) bath, even though what I'm doing is in line with current advice for looking after babies' sensitive skin. So, yeah, MIL is going against standard etiquette which has relevant reasoning behind it, which isn't cool.\n\nOn the other hand, OP sounds horribly stifling. Unless her aesthetic is black and white and also high contrast colours and patterns, and her minimalist lifestyle includes plenty of books and developmentally appropriate toys (which don't all stay developmentally appropriate for long), and the items that will last through their childhood and teenage years include a next-to-me or cot, pram, carrier, high chair, bouncer chair, etc. then she's either going to treat her baby poorly or get a sudden reality check once they're here and she finds out she doesn't have most things to suit their needs and expand their minds.

I don\u2019t think she did anything wrong, and OP\u2019s request that she keep it at her house seemed like a fair way to deal with it.  My mom was so excited to get stuff, nothing I could have done would have stopped her.  And it brought her joy, so hey\u2026.", "I am fully willing to see it is as unhelpful.  I just think calling it selfish is ridiculous.  I would imagine that the mother-in-law is pretty happy and a bit overexcited about the baby.  I can see how she\u2019d go nuts buying baby stuff.  She is missing the mark, yeah, but women get lots of gifts for babies they don\u2019t necessarily want or think they need.

My brain was different then and I was less judgy about appearances. Also, as a girl baby who always preferred blue, and my Mother let me have blue, I'm not going to be as judgy as some parents and think babies only need to wear what Mommy wants them to wear. My Mother preferred me in pink. I preferred blue. Guess what? I had boyish onesies (my favorite one actually had red stripes) with a lot of blue in them because that's what I liked and picked as a toddler (but I also had a pink one too because she likes pink) and it wasn't because my Mom was a liberal in those early years. It was because she was a giving, loving, Mother of mine. OP has a curated list for a minimal lifestyle. That sounds so boring. She knows her baby isn't going to be a toy doll, right?

There's nothing worse than having to constantly stare at and use a bunch of items you absolutely hate day in and day out when people could have got you things you like because they absolutely knew your style...you provided them with a list. Style and aesthetics are a form of art and it's important to some of us. That doesn't mean it can't be taken too far, and I do think things like stimulation and what's best for baby need to be taken into account, but there's no reason to choose something you like over what the parents will like.", "There should never be a mandate for gift giving nor did I suggest that. No one is obligated to give a gift. But, if there's a registry, it's because the celebrant specifically wants the items they picked and if the giver is going to use the registry, the way to use it is to buy the item selected. You don't have to give anyone a gift and you don't have to buy a gift off the registry but if you *are* going to give a gift of an item that is on the registry, then you should be buying that specific item that the person selected. If it's a generational difference to know how to use a registry, then I don't know what to tell you. That's how you use one and as I said in my previous comment, if people just used it as a suggestion for giving a gift, it would mean the recipient receives items that aren't their taste or style or color. It's a huge time sacrifice to create a gift registry; when someone does that, good manners and common sense should prevail in buying those specific items.\n\nIt used to be that a couple getting married were setting up their first home. Not just together, but at all. They needed household items and they picked out what they wanted in the styles, brands, designs, patterns, colors, price range, etc. Nowadays, couples are already in their own households, either with roommates or alone or living with their partner already. So, people don't necessarily need silver, china, etc. But, registries remain in heavy use by brides and moms-to-be. Check out a friend's online registry, you'll find all the things they picked and how many they want and all you do is click to buy and ship it to them. No one is using a registry as a suggestion tool. They want what they asked for.\n\nIncidentally, it used to be the height of bad manners to include on an invitation where a bride or mother-to-be was registered. You were supposed to contact the host of the shower or event and ask them. Now, every invitation I receive has a little card in it with the registry information. I like it because it's less hassle. I like buying off of a registry because then I know I'm giving my friend exactly what they want.\n\nThings change and I'm here for most of it but using a registry as a suggestion rather than giving the specific item(s) requested ain't one of 'em. LOL!", "I know what a gift is but you obviously don't know how much shit kids actually need and use. The whole point t of registries is to help save space, time, money and hassel and MIL is doing the opposite here. Instead of trying to help the new parents she is doing the opposite and creating headaches.\n\n Instead of sitting down with OP and OPs husband and saying \"hey, I think the baby would benefit more from this walker instead of the one on the registry\" or \"i know you liked this walker but i can only afford this one and i want to buy the walker for you\" and giving them the option to pick, she chose \"tough luck, I paid for it so you get what you get and don't complain about it\" that's not what gifts are either.", "Okay what about this - walkers are generally not even recommended these days. They have problems for babies hips. I had one for my older kid but by the time my second came around already the research convinced me we shouldn\u2019t be using one.

Not maliciously wrong, but frustratingly wrong. As a mom, I can obsessively research car seats, strollers, high chairs and other baby gear, and look for the features that are important to me, and read safety ratings and reviews, and consider deal-breakers in the specs. So if I tell you I want a specific stroller, etc. I have darn good reasons for picking it. Don\u2019t go off the reservation and get me something that won\u2019t fit in my car, is too heavy to maneuver, or has a lesser safety rating just because you think your choice is \u201ccuter\u201d than what I picked. \n\nMIL also may have antiquated notions of what babies need.

Registrants get **greedy**. I've known a few who wouldn't put anything less than $50 on their registry. If that's not in someone's range and they, GASP, go off registry, will the registry police arrest them? The answer for some people is yes. A wish list is just that, *wishes*.

They were like this when my mom was a kid...which made her go in the complete opposite direction and she cannot stand clutter and is a minimalist, sort of like OP (except at Christmas).\n\nHonestly, it feels like people are hating on OP because they perceive her to be one of those \"I live for Insta\" types because she mentioned \"aesthetic\". While those people influencers and those who try to live like them are irritating, I think we all have a preferred way of having our homes to look and feel. I can't say I'd be completely in love with someone buying me something I found tacky for my home....particularly when they have asked a registry of the items I want.

Now I have to not tell you how much I hate it because I don't want to hurt your feelings and then spend time trying to return it.
