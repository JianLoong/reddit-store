{"id": 32298, "submission_id": "18aat0x", "title": "AITA For kicking out my friend and ending the party after she fed my dog a \"treat\"?", "selftext": "Throwaway account since everyone involved may find this..\n\nI(28F)always knew that when I can live alone, I wanted to have a dog. When I moved, I had that opportunity in the form of a relative's pet that needed to be rehomed. She was already very old(13), deaf and generally needed a lot of attention. Its been a year and I love this fucking dog. tldr she truly changed my life. I am absolutely an annoying dog mom.\n\nShes is also very allergic to SOMEthing that her vet and I are trying to figure out what. It manifests in dry flaky skin that she will itch hard enough to bleed. We're trying a food allergy trial. This means she is on a very specific diet of a prescription dry food until a trial period of 8-9 weeks is over. If she does get something off-menu, we have to start the trial period over. Most of my friends know this because I always complain how expensive the food is. \n\nCut to the party: I invited a few close friends around to my place for a holiday shindig. Living far away, work, etc usually keeps us apart so I was super excited.\n\nI ordered us McDonald's (we all agreed beforehand to split a big order because why the fuck not) and made a ton of jokes to my dog about how 'None of it is for you young lady!' in front of everyone. I'll admit this was a thinly veiled reminder for everyone else too. The food comes and we're all having a good time.\n\nI step away to find my friend (25F) dropping a piece of fish filet for my dog to gobble up in the kitchen. I freak out and ask her what she was doing. Again, my dog is deaf so she just keeps pawing my friend for another peice, which she gave her saying \"But shes so cute! A little peice of fish cant hurt\"\n\nIll admit it, I kind of lost it. We were 6 weeks into the trial and now I would have to start all over, buying so much more expensive food. I'm sure I yelled and cussed at her. I dont really remember, I saw red. I do remember telling everyone that Im sorry but I'm too angry to enjoy or host a party right now and asked everyone to leave. I told them to also feel free to take the remaining food and don't worry about paying for their shares since I'm the reason the party is ending early.\n\nThe next day I apologized to my friend for yelling. She seems very hurt and isn't very open to continuing the conversation. She says she honestly forgot and didnt see the harm. To be fair, fish was on the list of things I don't suspect she is allergic to and may have mentioned that to the group. Also, my dog also is on other medications that stop any harmful reactions to off-list foods. At most she'll get flaky skin, but not super itchy or upset stomach or anything. \n\nMy friends overall seem pretty split. Half the group thinks im justified and aren't upset with me ending the party knowing how much I care about my dog. The other half thinks I'm overreacting over a piece of fish.", "created_utc": 1701659156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18aat0x/aita_for_kicking_out_my_friend_and_ending_the/", "score": 438, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anytime outside of this diet gave her pain and unending diarrhea. On top of that age was incontinent due to her conditions causing muscle waste. \n\nI do want to add that there are some grains and proteins that dogs often can't tolerate. Mine was VERY allergic to anything corn or poultry. Like even a whisper of those 2 ingredients would for sure five her and eat infection but if it was enough she would get a skin infection. I am so sorry you had to back track(mine also did the food elimination diet via the vet but it was a bit different than yours).

So all of those friends that disagree with you and it was just a piece of fish send them the bill for the expensive dog food. My dog has to have special prescription dog food that\u2019s very expensive. And if my friends did something like that, I would give them the friggin bill, or tell them to hit the road and never come back. That is not something you feed to a dog regardless from McDonald\u2019s. French fries maybe their fish sandwich absolutely not. You\u2019re six weeks into a nine week trial and now you have to start all over again. I think you need an itemized bill from the vet on how much it\u2019s going to cost you and how much you already paid so they get the point of why you were so upset. I\u2019m pissed off for you just reading what happened", "NTA. I have dogs. I puppy sits for an extended family 1-2 times a year. It's maximum 6 dogs & 3 cats.

Best case it\u2019s just rude, worse case you could make them suffer terribly.", "Honestly? Depending on the cost of the food, I would want the friend that fed her an off menu item to either partially cover the cost or entirely cover the cost because now you have to restart and rebuy the food as you (I assume) won't have enough to cover the full 8-9 week period left.\n\nPersonally I would just tell the ones that think you're overreacting this:  \"*Hey guys, I need you all to understand that this isn't over a piece of fish like you seem to think. That was the trigger, yes, but what I am upset about is the time and money that piece of fish is going to cost me. I was on week 6 of 9 out of the trial period and being able to figure out what is causing my dog to have such bad dry skin that she scratches until she bleeds. Because of that piece of fish, I have to restart; I'm set back 6 weeks and out of pocket \\[amount\\] because I need to buy more of the prescription food. I am upset because of time, money and for the wellbeing of my dog - not because of 'a piece of fish'.\"*\n\nI'd also probably send a separate text to the friend that fed your dog the fish and either continue the conversation over text or invite her over to continue the conversation in person. During that conversation, I would absolutely be saying something along the lines of \"*I understand that you forgot and it was a genuine mistake, but it is something that is still costing me time and money; I have to get more of the prescription food and I would really appreciate it if you helped me cover (half?) the cost of it.\"*\n\nHonestly, If I were her, I'd be offering to cover the full cost of the food entirely; lack of bad intent doesn't negate the negative impact and, imo, it should be her responsibility to alleviate as much of the negative impact that her actions are having on you. She can't give you back the lost time, but she can and should help with the financial hit it's causing you.", "NTA  For kicking her out.  How clueless is she?

You don't feed other people's dogs or children without permission. Your friend had no idea whether your dog was allergic to fish.", "She was wrong. Your level of feeling is understandable.

Even though I have fed them treats many times, I ask every single time if it\u2019s ok. For all I know, they are fasting for a procedure, or they may have developed an allergy.

Yes. If only you had better clarity of judgement to understand that 6 weeks into an 8 week session of vet prescribed dietary restrictions is too little to be frustrated about starting completely over from scratch because your friend had a feeling, an urge really, to forget your dog's diet and feed off-diet food. After all, your dog was so cute, what's the harm in making her itchy for however long just because your friend wanted to feel good about herself and it *could* have been worse symptoms! And maybe the dog wasn't even allergic! And she was sO cUtE!! \ud83d\ude44 <end sarcasm>\n\nNow, in all seriousness, your friend put her personal feelings over the medical wellbeing of your dog. Yes, you might have overreacted A LITTLE BIT but it was well-deserved on your friend's part.

I didn\u2019t clear out the house of all guests after a rage explosion big enough that I could remember it. You\u2019re definitely in the right firmly putting an end to the feeding.

You need to be actually clear and firm about restrictions around the health of your dog when people enter the house. Should she have given the dog a treat? Probably not but I genuinely think it was a minor mistake that could have been calmly resolved instead of screaming, cursing and throwing everybody out of your house.

This means she is on a very specific diet of a prescription dry food until a trial period of 8-9 weeks is over. If she does get something off-menu, we have to start the trial period over. Most of my friends know this because I always complain how expensive the food is. \n\nCut to the party: I invited a few close friends around to my place for a holiday shindig. Living far away, work, etc usually keeps us apart so I was super excited.\n\nI ordered us McDonald's (we all agreed beforehand to split a big order because why the fuck not) and made a ton of jokes to my dog about how 'None of it is for you young lady!' in front of everyone. I'll admit this was a thinly veiled reminder for everyone else too. The food comes and we're all having a good time.\n\nI step away to find my friend (25F) dropping a piece of fish filet for my dog to gobble up in the kitchen. I freak out and ask her what she was doing. Again, my dog is deaf so she just keeps pawing my friend for another peice, which she gave her saying \"But shes so cute! A little peice of fish cant hurt\"\n\nIll admit it, I kind of lost it. We were 6 weeks into the trial and now I would have to start all over, buying so much more expensive food. I'm sure I yelled and cussed at her. I dont really remember, I saw red. I do remember telling everyone that Im sorry but I'm too angry to enjoy or host a party right now and asked everyone to leave. I told them to also feel free to take the remaining food and don't worry about paying for their shares since I'm the reason the party is ending early.\n\nThe next day I apologized to my friend for yelling. She seems very hurt and isn't very open to continuing the conversation. She says she honestly forgot and didnt see the harm. To be fair, fish was on the list of things I don't suspect she is allergic to and may have mentioned that to the group. Also, my dog also is on other medications that stop any harmful reactions to off-list foods. At most she'll get flaky skin, but not super itchy or upset stomach or anything. \n\nMy friends overall seem pretty split. Half the group thinks im justified and aren't upset with me ending the party knowing how much I care about my dog. The other half thinks I'm overreacting over a piece of fish.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Didn't think so.", "ESH\nScreaming and swearing at someone you still want to be friends with later?  Losing control to the point you don't even know what you said or are too embarrassed to repeat it here? Not okay.

I get annoyed with my mom any time she gives my dogs table scraps and they AREN\u2019T on a strict diet. I don\u2019t mind giving them tiny pieces every so often but she\u2019s the kind of person that lets her dog clean her plate after EVERY meal. I don\u2019t want my dogs to expect table scraps whenever food is out. \n\nOn the other hand, having worked at a vet clinic and helped with allergy trials: fish is one of the lesser common allergies. It\u2019s much more likely to be grain, chicken, or even beef. I would discuss with your vet, if you haven\u2019t already, explain the amount of fish that was given and see if you would actually need to restart the food trial. It may be a negligible amount since it was only this one time that you won\u2019t need to restart. \n\nOverall, NTA. You\u2019ve gotta protect and advocate for your dog. Even if it seems silly or unnecessary to your friend group. Give your friend some space and try talking to her about it, particularly after you speak to your vet. Unless she\u2019s been through something similar with her own animals/kids, she likely didn\u2019t understand the gravity of her actions. And while that doesn\u2019t make it ok, explaining this with a calm head and also acknowledging you could\u2019ve handled it better will go a long way. \n\nBest of luck with the doggo OP.", "NTA. You don\u2019t give a pet food without permission, period.

That\u2019s my biggest gripe, it\u2019s not that she fed the dog something \u201cnaughty\u201d (which op\u2019s friend still shouldn\u2019t have done ofc) it\u2019s that she messed with a medical situation and is costing op money, prescription dog food can be really fucking expensive depending on the type", "Shes one of the folks I talk to regularly and am constantly mentioning her \"new\" diet.

Continting the night with host in a bad frame of mind?\nI'd rather my friend have the time and space they needed to chill out.", "Right?! It wasn\u2019t the other friend\u2019s fault that one person fed her dog. This was a huge over reaction on her part. \n\nShe could have gotten mad at the friend, but if she mentioned to the friend that fish was okay, I could see where the friend wouldn\u2019t have thought it was a big deal.
