{"id": 32298, "submission_id": "18aat0x", "title": "AITA For kicking out my friend and ending the party after she fed my dog a \"treat\"?", "selftext": "Throwaway account since everyone involved may find this..\n\nI(28F)always knew that when I can live alone, I wanted to have a dog. When I moved, I had that opportunity in the form of a relative's pet that needed to be rehomed. She was already very old(13), deaf and generally needed a lot of attention. Its been a year and I love this fucking dog. tldr she truly changed my life. I am absolutely an annoying dog mom.\n\nShes is also very allergic to SOMEthing that her vet and I are trying to figure out what. It manifests in dry flaky skin that she will itch hard enough to bleed. We're trying a food allergy trial. This means she is on a very specific diet of a prescription dry food until a trial period of 8-9 weeks is over. If she does get something off-menu, we have to start the trial period over. Most of my friends know this because I always complain how expensive the food is. \n\nCut to the party: I invited a few close friends around to my place for a holiday shindig. Living far away, work, etc usually keeps us apart so I was super excited.\n\nI ordered us McDonald's (we all agreed beforehand to split a big order because why the fuck not) and made a ton of jokes to my dog about how 'None of it is for you young lady!' in front of everyone. I'll admit this was a thinly veiled reminder for everyone else too. The food comes and we're all having a good time.\n\nI step away to find my friend (25F) dropping a piece of fish filet for my dog to gobble up in the kitchen. I freak out and ask her what she was doing. Again, my dog is deaf so she just keeps pawing my friend for another peice, which she gave her saying \"But shes so cute! A little peice of fish cant hurt\"\n\nIll admit it, I kind of lost it. We were 6 weeks into the trial and now I would have to start all over, buying so much more expensive food. I'm sure I yelled and cussed at her. I dont really remember, I saw red. I do remember telling everyone that Im sorry but I'm too angry to enjoy or host a party right now and asked everyone to leave. I told them to also feel free to take the remaining food and don't worry about paying for their shares since I'm the reason the party is ending early.\n\nThe next day I apologized to my friend for yelling. She seems very hurt and isn't very open to continuing the conversation. She says she honestly forgot and didnt see the harm. To be fair, fish was on the list of things I don't suspect she is allergic to and may have mentioned that to the group. Also, my dog also is on other medications that stop any harmful reactions to off-list foods. At most she'll get flaky skin, but not super itchy or upset stomach or anything. \n\nMy friends overall seem pretty split. Half the group thinks im justified and aren't upset with me ending the party knowing how much I care about my dog. The other half thinks I'm overreacting over a piece of fish.", "created_utc": 1701659156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18aat0x/aita_for_kicking_out_my_friend_and_ending_the/", "score": 1557, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anytime outside of this diet gave her pain and unending diarrhea. On top of that age was incontinent due to her conditions causing muscle waste. \n\nI do want to add that there are some grains and proteins that dogs often can't tolerate. Mine was VERY allergic to anything corn or poultry. Like even a whisper of those 2 ingredients would for sure five her and eat infection but if it was enough she would get a skin infection. I am so sorry you had to back track(mine also did the food elimination diet via the vet but it was a bit different than yours).

So all of those friends that disagree with you and it was just a piece of fish send them the bill for the expensive dog food. My dog has to have special prescription dog food that\u2019s very expensive. And if my friends did something like that, I would give them the friggin bill, or tell them to hit the road and never come back. That is not something you feed to a dog regardless from McDonald\u2019s. French fries maybe their fish sandwich absolutely not. You\u2019re six weeks into a nine week trial and now you have to start all over again. I think you need an itemized bill from the vet on how much it\u2019s going to cost you and how much you already paid so they get the point of why you were so upset. I\u2019m pissed off for you just reading what happened", "NTA. I have dogs. I puppy sits for an extended family 1-2 times a year. It's maximum 6 dogs & 3 cats.

Best case it\u2019s just rude, worse case you could make them suffer terribly.", "Honestly? Depending on the cost of the food, I would want the friend that fed her an off menu item to either partially cover the cost or entirely cover the cost because now you have to restart and rebuy the food as you (I assume) won't have enough to cover the full 8-9 week period left.\n\nPersonally I would just tell the ones that think you're overreacting this:  \"*Hey guys, I need you all to understand that this isn't over a piece of fish like you seem to think. That was the trigger, yes, but what I am upset about is the time and money that piece of fish is going to cost me. I was on week 6 of 9 out of the trial period and being able to figure out what is causing my dog to have such bad dry skin that she scratches until she bleeds. Because of that piece of fish, I have to restart; I'm set back 6 weeks and out of pocket \\[amount\\] because I need to buy more of the prescription food. I am upset because of time, money and for the wellbeing of my dog - not because of 'a piece of fish'.\"*\n\nI'd also probably send a separate text to the friend that fed your dog the fish and either continue the conversation over text or invite her over to continue the conversation in person. During that conversation, I would absolutely be saying something along the lines of \"*I understand that you forgot and it was a genuine mistake, but it is something that is still costing me time and money; I have to get more of the prescription food and I would really appreciate it if you helped me cover (half?) the cost of it.\"*\n\nHonestly, If I were her, I'd be offering to cover the full cost of the food entirely; lack of bad intent doesn't negate the negative impact and, imo, it should be her responsibility to alleviate as much of the negative impact that her actions are having on you. She can't give you back the lost time, but she can and should help with the financial hit it's causing you.", "NTA  For kicking her out.  How clueless is she?

You don't feed other people's dogs or children without permission. Your friend had no idea whether your dog was allergic to fish.", "She was wrong. Your level of feeling is understandable.

Even though I have fed them treats many times, I ask every single time if it\u2019s ok. For all I know, they are fasting for a procedure, or they may have developed an allergy.

Yes. If only you had better clarity of judgement to understand that 6 weeks into an 8 week session of vet prescribed dietary restrictions is too little to be frustrated about starting completely over from scratch because your friend had a feeling, an urge really, to forget your dog's diet and feed off-diet food. After all, your dog was so cute, what's the harm in making her itchy for however long just because your friend wanted to feel good about herself and it *could* have been worse symptoms! And maybe the dog wasn't even allergic! And she was sO cUtE!! \ud83d\ude44 <end sarcasm>\n\nNow, in all seriousness, your friend put her personal feelings over the medical wellbeing of your dog. Yes, you might have overreacted A LITTLE BIT but it was well-deserved on your friend's part.

I didn\u2019t clear out the house of all guests after a rage explosion big enough that I could remember it. You\u2019re definitely in the right firmly putting an end to the feeding.

You need to be actually clear and firm about restrictions around the health of your dog when people enter the house. Should she have given the dog a treat? Probably not but I genuinely think it was a minor mistake that could have been calmly resolved instead of screaming, cursing and throwing everybody out of your house.

This means she is on a very specific diet of a prescription dry food until a trial period of 8-9 weeks is over. If she does get something off-menu, we have to start the trial period over. Most of my friends know this because I always complain how expensive the food is. \n\nCut to the party: I invited a few close friends around to my place for a holiday shindig. Living far away, work, etc usually keeps us apart so I was super excited.\n\nI ordered us McDonald's (we all agreed beforehand to split a big order because why the fuck not) and made a ton of jokes to my dog about how 'None of it is for you young lady!' in front of everyone. I'll admit this was a thinly veiled reminder for everyone else too. The food comes and we're all having a good time.\n\nI step away to find my friend (25F) dropping a piece of fish filet for my dog to gobble up in the kitchen. I freak out and ask her what she was doing. Again, my dog is deaf so she just keeps pawing my friend for another peice, which she gave her saying \"But shes so cute! A little peice of fish cant hurt\"\n\nIll admit it, I kind of lost it. We were 6 weeks into the trial and now I would have to start all over, buying so much more expensive food. I'm sure I yelled and cussed at her. I dont really remember, I saw red. I do remember telling everyone that Im sorry but I'm too angry to enjoy or host a party right now and asked everyone to leave. I told them to also feel free to take the remaining food and don't worry about paying for their shares since I'm the reason the party is ending early.\n\nThe next day I apologized to my friend for yelling. She seems very hurt and isn't very open to continuing the conversation. She says she honestly forgot and didnt see the harm. To be fair, fish was on the list of things I don't suspect she is allergic to and may have mentioned that to the group. Also, my dog also is on other medications that stop any harmful reactions to off-list foods. At most she'll get flaky skin, but not super itchy or upset stomach or anything. \n\nMy friends overall seem pretty split. Half the group thinks im justified and aren't upset with me ending the party knowing how much I care about my dog. The other half thinks I'm overreacting over a piece of fish.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If someone says 'pet doesn't get x food' I don't immediately go out of my way to give the relevant pet whatever food they can't have - it's rude, and shitty, not to mention dangerous if it's a severe allergen.\n\nIf someone gave my cat a piece of chicken after being *reminded not to give her any* and hit me with 'what's the harm?' I'd be sending them the highest definition photos possible of the explosive diarrhea and skin infections she'd be getting from it.

Allergies are a serious thing, she could have seriously harmed your dog.", "My old dog was allergic to wheat, beef, corn, & soy\u2026 We went through a hell of a time getting all of that diagnosed! \n\nIt was incredibly annoying & she\u2019d be *so* miserable every time she got into foods with any of those things in \u2018em, but there were people in my life who could just never remember for the life of them\u2026 As well as some people who can\u2019t help themselves from feeding table food to a cute dog. \n\nNot saying that it\u2019s right at all (I feel like it\u2019s super disrespectful & based in ignorance), but a lot of non-dog owners just won\u2019t bother to save that information in their brains. They\u2019ll write it off as \u201cnot that serious\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cjust a dog\u201d, or think that dogs can eat anything in cartoon world/ their world where they don\u2019t put much thought into dogs\u2019 heath issues or well-being. \n\nSometimes we can choose to put down firm boundaries in our relationships (like your friend, who obviously needed the point clearly explained to her, reiterated, & told that yes, it is that serious) & sometimes we can\u2019t (like my ex\u2019s 90 year old grandmother who\u2019d sneak chicken bones to our dog under the table no matter how many times we explained why it wasn\u2019t okay, & who\u2019d say \u201cit\u2019s our little secret\u201d to the dog as she gagged on bone splinters)\u2026 \n\nBut as long as you aren\u2019t literally ending your friendships over this, you\u2019re NTA. Just practice being more clear with others about your dog\u2019s needs- give them a speech before they enter the house if you need to. I lived in a house where we had a big sign of my dog\u2019s allergies posted on the wall. \n\nIf you\u2019re gonna embrace the crazy dog mom title & take this on as your priority, communicate it clearly & take it far enough that the people around you can\u2019t use \u201cI forgot\u201d or \u201cyou never told me\u201d as an excuse. Maybe they\u2019ll think you\u2019re being dramatic, but we all get to choose what to be dramatic about & they can take it or leave it.", "Probably going to get voted down but\u2026\n\nBut I don\u2019t understand all of the not NAs. You already admitted that you were in the wrong, right? You called your friend to apologize because you admitted you were in the wrong. \n\nTo your friend you are TA for cussing and overreacting, which you admit to. \n\nTo your other friends, you\u2019re T A for kicking them out when they didn\u2019t do anything. \n\nYou are also T A for expecting the friend to remember and understand the details of your dog\u2019s life without reminding them. \n\nBut your friend was also wrong do ESH.", "No, OP does not have to do that.\n\nIf dog is suddenly super itchy again after improvements happened, then the ingredients list for filet o fish contains an allergen. If dog is same as it was before that evening, then you can cross the ingredients off from filet o fish as likely allergens. \n\nIt\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s not something that requires you to restart a 6 week process of diet elimination to find allergens. At absolute most it delays things by 3-7 days.", "There\u2019s definitely value in an elimination diet especially when struggling to pinpoint the cause but 9 weeks on their prescription only food isn\u2019t the only way. Prescription food is often recommended by vets owned by private equity because of it being near guaranteed monthly recurring incoming versus without it most clients are coming once a year.", "She kicked everyone out. What about those people who gave up on their time to do other things to attend OP\u2019s party . Their feelings don\u2019t count ?\n\nFew years back , we were throwing a birthday party for my daughter , it was a garden party so I didn\u2019t think of removing breakable items from around the house and one of the kids went inside the house to use the washroom and accidentally broke an item that had a very emotional value to me as it belonged to my late father. My heart was breaking as I was collecting the pieces. I took myself out for some time and knowing how upset all the kids would be including my own daughter if this party was to be ruined , I decided to go back . Empathy is a two way street.Needless to say the parents apologized profusely.", "It\u2019s not ego , it\u2019s called self respect. You respect others , you expect the same level of respect back . Ego is an exaggerated sense of self importance and has nothing to do with simply not being ok with being kicked out of other people houses where you have done nothing to warrant their disrespectful behavior.", "when were they told that?", "OP never said that", "Potatoes as well, and all the additives in everything that has been fried. It is rare for restaurants in general and almost unheard of for the bulk of fast food places in America to have separate deep fryers for different ingredients/menu items. And whatever type of oil was used\u2014 McD's uses a canola, corn, and soybean blend, and those are pretty common allergens, too.\n\n(Before anyone jumps on me for it, I know in a \"true\" allergy, a \"pure\" oil wouldn't have proteins in it to set off an allergenic response. But I also know there's a huge number of reactions and sensitivities that can make you sick without being allergies, even if a food sensitivity is a trigger for a secondary autoimmune response that looks more classically like an allergy. And on top of that, our food processing is... not fantastic in America. Oil doesn't have to carry contaminants on its own for the oil to still end up contaminated at any point between seeds being planted to processed refined & blended foods ending up in someone's stomach.)", "We've fed our dog grain free for as long as we've had her.  That's what everyone said was the best thing for them.  Apparently, grain free can cause heart problems.  CAN because it's not unusual but it's not common.  So now we have to switch her to grain.  Dog diets are weird.", "My brother\u2019s dog has to wear a cone occasionally when he\u2019s biting his paws. He looks so cute in it.", "The cone of shame!!", "Gross warning!\n\nFun fact: although they didn't eat it directly, they did eat some when they killed something that was a herbivore and ate it's guts (usually something small).\n\nBut that was back in wolf days, which was a looong time ago, genetically speaking. \n\nAnd humans have massively changed corn, even in the last few hundred years, let alone in the time it took for wolves to be dogs. What they (and we) evolved with is *not* what we've got now.", "Thanks for the info! Ill make a note if she has any reactions", "would you have the same response if it was a child and not a dog??", "She didn\u2019t forget that\u2019s why she said \u201c BUT, she\u2019s just so cute, a little piece of fish can\u2019t hurt \u201c", "So frustrating!", "You nailed it. As an autistic person, this is the bane of my existence.", "There are SO MANY differences with your story. You were not the only one throwing the party, also not the one who the party was for. So you were able to get a moment for just yourself while the party could continue. It was an accident where people apologized and not a deliberate action the other person doubled down on.\n\nNot to mention that you really say \u2018gave up their time\u2019 to spend time with a friend? How is it your friend if you feel you are given up your precious time to be with them?", "Do you just casually feed animals because you want to and you haven't been told to your face you can't.

I can just imagine ANY cat's reaction to that phrase....", "They're often in medicines, too! My dog recently needed Proin, which only comes flavored unless you get it specially compounded. We decided to try the Proin ER, because it's really small and only given once a day, so we thought maybe he could handle the tiny amount of chicken flavoring. Two ear infections, a yeast infection and a wart later (from going back to a former, higher dose of apoquel) and we're not trying that medicine, again.", "One of my cats is allergic to beef, I feel u.

I have a friend whose dog is allergic to meat and protein. He can only have a very specific type of dry food, otherwise he'll have terrible rashes and diarrhea. People don't feed other people's dogs without permission. If your friend wanted to give your dog s treat, she could've asked you, and you could've given friend some appropriate food to give the dog as a treat.", "My dog has a dermatologist and gets custom allergy shots, just like humans. I've been told that that's \"So Californian of me.\" Sorry, was I supposed to ignore the constant ear infections and the terrible paw-licking mouth sounds???", "I had a dog that was sensitive so I had to give her avoderm. I have always avoided corn because it gave my first dogs horrible gas to give them any food with that, it's just a cheap filler. I've given lamb and rice from Kahoots for years now (I think that store might only be in my county not even the whole state). \nNTA, I'd be so upset too. Could you have given a more clear reminder? Sure..but you don't feed other people's pets unless you're pet sitting and following directions. Hope you figure it out soon!", "What kind of dog is it? I don\u2019t have dogs anymore and I definitely miss it.", "You sound like a wonderful person.\n\nYou're not \"doing too much,\" at all. Some people just don't let animals into their hearts the same way as people like you. \n\nMaking sure an older pups life is as enjoyable as possible is a big task, and it speaks so much to your character that you want to make her time left the best it can be. \n\nKeep loving that pup the best you can, you're doing great!", "Our yorkie was allergic to oats and chicken. Chicken was the worst. I don't remember what the numbers were but chicken was off the chart. We just paid for the allergy test vs the food trial because the food trial was such a long lasting huge pain in the ass plus the expense of the food. I think the test was like $300 and we were done. Hope you figure of out.\n\nI'd have been livid too by the way.", "Story to highlight that during hosting any event , something can go wrong. Throwing everyone out is  not only disrespectful but shows lack of empathy to their own feelings.\n\nAnd yes you give up on time you could be using to get other things done or even relax at home when you accept an invitation to spend this time with someone else . That doesn\u2019t indicate that you are not enjoying this time which is not what OP friends got in return of their time", "OP described it as being angry , being angry doesn\u2019t justify being rude. People learn to practice emotional regulation. Emotional regulation doesn\u2019t mean \u201c suck it up\u201d it means being in control of One\u2019s own emotions. \n\nI can\u2019t get angry at a work meeting and start kicking everyone out of my office , you know why because there will be consequences to showing this level of disrespect to coworkers.\n\nIf we can practice self restraint with people that we are not close with, I guess choosing people that are we closer to as easier targets and emotional punch bags is a very missed up thing to do.\n\nMental strength is not being promoted strongly enough.

Did not say it in those terms.", "1) she told them before and assumed they'd remember. you know what happens when you assume things\n2) she did not say in front of everyone that nothing was for the dog, she taunted the dog that she wasnt going to give her any of her mcdonalds. if anything this probably just encouraged her friend to give the dog a treat because she felt bad for it. \n3) How would her friend have any idea that feeding someone's dog is wrong if nobody ever told her?", "Cat's reaction:\n\nLooks at you... Meh.  and turns their back.", "I double this. I wish so badly sometimes that I had more videos of my dog before she died (6 years ago now). \n\nI can also sympathise with the allergies thing as my cat has suffered from allergies that do the exact same thing.
