Happy the problem is she refused to let me go because of my service dog \nFor a bit of context \nI have a service dog for many medical reasons without him. I legitimately would not be here. He has saved my life way too many times. He\u2019s not a very big dog. He\u2019s a blue heeler roughly about 50 pounds and about knee height honestly most people don\u2019t even notice he\u2019s there.\n\nSo the problem occurred when I told her that I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to her wedding unless my service dog go and that\u2019s when she gave me the ultimatum of it either her or my dog \nHonestly, I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that as she\u2019s never really done that before throughout the whole process of planning her wedding she\u2019s honestly been a bit of a bridezilla, but I didn\u2019t think that she would refuse to let me bring my medical equipment to her wedding, and her reasoning was that he would take too much attention from her Even though he would be sitting under the table and no one would even know he was there. It also didn\u2019t make sense to me because she brought her dog who is very unruly and has little to no manners.\nAlso, I was only going for the reception I wasn\u2019t going to the after as I am autistic and can\u2019t handle things like that \nBut in her own words, he would ruin her wedding. I tried to bring up the factor of I could pass out and hit my head. If he\u2019s not there, causing me to end up going to the hospital, but she did not want to hear any of it and instead told the rest of our family about how inconsiderate I was being and how it\u2019s just a dog and it\u2019s not that serious , even though she knows what happens when he\u2019s not with me she seen it firsthand she\u2019s been in the ER with me\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do because this is still causing problems.

When people say you should've left the dog at home, simply ask \"If I was in a wheelchair, should I have left that at home? If I needed portable oxygen, should I have left that at home? Why didn't you leave your glasses at home?\"", "NTA. You\u2019re right in saying your service dog is medical equipment, and you should never be asked to leave your dog away from you. Your sister can limit guests at her wedding as she chooses, but she doesn\u2019t have the right to get mad then when her decisions limit who chooses or can come to her wedding.", "NTA. Sounds like this is over right?  Whoever is still bringing it up is an asshole like your sister. Cut them out or just ignore them!", "NTA. \n\nImagine being so insecure you feel a 50lb service dog will take attention away from you on your wedding day", "NAH. You had a legitimate reason to want to bring your dog. She did not want your dog at the wedding. No one should be mad at you for staying away. Since the wedding is now long past I wouldn't dwell on it; it's over and done. If people still say you should've left the dog home, just say \"Oh,\" and don't invite further discussion.", "NTA. Let's look at some scenarios. \n\n1. You bring the dog and your sister is so focused on it that she assumes he is outshining her on her big day and taking up all the attention. \n2. You don't bring the dog and have a medical event requiring medical attention, which would definitely take up all the attention. \n\nI'm sorry to say but it sounds like she just didn't want you at the wedding and used this as an excuse. Else, she is one of those brides who seem convinced that their wedding is a royal event with guests being peasants who should be grateful for the chance to shower her with praise and presents.", "NTA\n\nHad anyone in your family got a pacemaker? Or need insulin injections? Have THEY been asked to leave those at home because injecting insulin during the reception would be taking too much attention away from the bride? You said it yourself: it's not a dog, it's medical equipment.\n\nI don't know who these people are who said you should've left your dog at home but clearly they don't understand what a medical alert dog is.\n\nYour sister's lost touch with reality for a moment there, hopefully once the stress of the wedding has gone she'll apologise for her behaviour. She'll be the lady in white, people won't be able to miss her being in the room. It'll be ok.", "NTA", "NTA. She made you choose between not attending her wedding and attending without your medical equipment. You made the choice that was best for you, cool! That should have been the end of the whole thing. Must have been a pretty boring wedding if this is what they\u2019re talking about when remembering the wedding a year later.", "Its fine not to attend. If you used a wheelchair, it would be admitted. Your service animal is working every time you're out with him. And rather than try to keep explaining the nuances of service dogs as opposed to companion animals its not worth any additional stress, IMO.\n\nShow her what inconsiderate really looks like and wait until the last calendar day possible to decline the invitation.\n\nNTA.", "NTA tbh I wouldn\u2019t have even asked in your situation - It\u2019s imperative to your health and safety to have your dog. That\u2019s like telling someone they can\u2019t bring their oxygen tank. Your sisters own fault if she doesn\u2019t understand that. \n\nThe comment on her dog tho was AH - it\u2019s their wedding, if she wants her pets that\u2019s on her.", "Nta, but your sister is.", "NTA.  It's awful that we may have reached a point where people with actual service animals may need to carry a card, like a license, to validate their medical need for that animal because so many people call their pets service animals to abuse the system.  It sounds like your family believes your dog falls in the category of pet.  Do you have any idea why they think that?", "Nta - He's there to keep you from getting hurt and you literally don't have the option to not have him near you. She gave you a ridiculous ultimatum. If she's still upset, she only has herself to blame.", "NAH. You say your dog is necessary. Bride doesn\u2019t want a dog at her wedding. Don\u2019t go.", "NTA. But console yourself: Your sister's wedding is not an earth shattering event that you must be at if you want to live, even if she thinks so. It is just a party where some of the participants wear slightly weird clothes. You and your dog can live very well without having been there.", "Your sister gave you a simple choice. If you came you could not bring the dog. Or you should not come at all.\n\nOk, so you decided to skip what was aparrently the social event of the century because you fear for your safety without your dog. And your sister, the bride/center of the universe for the day, didn\u2019t feel like accommodating you. \n\nBecause she didn\u2019t GAF if maybe you had a medical event without your dog, because your dog is\u2026 cuter than she is in her big white dress and wedding makeup and your dog might steal some of her spotlight? I roll my eyes. \n\nWhy are you even questioning yourself? So what, you missed your sister\u2019s party. And people are still giving you a hard time over it?! These people aren\u2019t your friends. These people aren\u2019t your *family*. Family cares about your health and safety and these people do *not*.  NTA", "NTA, you obviously need your dog, but there are many good  reasons not to want one at a wedding ceremony. Others being afraid or allergic are just a couple of reasons. You did the right thing by deciding not to go. She should have accepted that you just couldn't make it.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s stupid. \nIt\u2019s over. \nRefuse to discuss it. \n\u201cNope, not this again.\u201d\n\u201cNot going to discuss this.\u201d", "NTA the dog is important for obvious reasons.  It\u2019s not like you want to bring him just because.  He\u2019s there for your health and medically necessary.  I wouldn\u2019t have gone either.  Anybody who thinks you are in the wrong is delusional.", "Nta shes worried about a dog outshining her? Does she think that little of herself? Most people know service dogs are working.", "This.  NTA\n\nIf you were blind, would you have to leave your service dog? These dogs are trained. She should have been able to deal.", "That doesn\u2019t seem to factor in at all. The sister doesn\u2019t want the dog there because it\u2019ll be distracting, not because she doubts that it\u2019s a real service dog.", "Yeah. A while ago I remembering reading a thing where the bride said, hey, I need my friend to leave her seeing eye dog at home because I'm super allergic and I love my friend but I don't want to be drowsy/itchy/sniffly at my wedding. And it sucks because competing accommodations are always a bummer! but this? This is just weird self-centered behavior. It's a medical alert dog!! What a cruel thing to demand of your sibling.", "Completely - all of this. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso the irony is that sister doesn\u2019t want her wedding ruined by the service dog and the spotlight not being on her, yet hasn\u2019t considered that nothing says ruined wedding / spotlight elsewhere like someone fainting resulting in a 911 call and paramedics.\n\nTell her many blessings for your special day - sorry I\u2019ll miss it sis \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc", "Reread the last few sentences.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was going to say! What do you want to bet sister would have also blamed OP for ruining the wedding if they indeed had a medical emergency that was not prevented by the service dog. \n\nSister set her rules (unreasonable as they are) and you made your (reasonable) choice within those parameters. NTA in the slightest, it\u2019s ridiculous for you to risk your physical health/safety to attend her party. Anyone who thinks otherwise is an AH.", "Honestly, OP. \nThis should be what you tell them. \n\n\"Sheez aunt Louise. I'm sure Sister would have just LOVED the attention I would have gotten at the wedding if I fainted and the place was filled with paramedics.\"", "Oh 100% - you\u2019re dead on.\n\nOf course it would be sisters fault for fainting and having the EMTs show up as well - even though she left the dog at home like she was asked to.", "The best news ever for me would be if OP says she actually has an aunt Louise.\n\nJust so she can say exactly the \u201cSheez aunt Louise\u201d \ud83d\ude02"]}
