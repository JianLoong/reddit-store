I don't like kids and don't want to be responsible for them.  My siblings have accepted this and they never ask me to watch their kids.  It's caused some arguments at family gatherings when the kids are playing and ask me to play with them and I refuse.  My older brother even told his kids in front of me that \"She doesn't like kids, go play somewhere else.\"  Which pissed me off because it made me the bad guy in front of everyone.\n\nLast week my SIL called me in hysterics and told me that her husband (my brother) had an accident at work and was at the hospital.  She said she was on her way there but needed someone to watch their kids after they got done with school.  She asked if I could just go to their house to watch them because she doesn't know any details of what's going on and doesn't know how long she will be at the hospital.\n\nI told her flat out \"no.\"  I learned long ago that \"no\" is a complete sentence in these situations and that I don't need to justify my reasons.  She tried to plead with me but I just kept saying \"no.\"  Eventually, she started screaming at me so I hung up.  \n\nLater that night I got a call from my mom and she immediately started yelling at me too.  She said that SIL had to leave my brother alone at the hospital to go figure out a plan for the kids.  I asked her how my brother was doing and she actually told me \"He'll be ok, not that you care anything about your family anyway.\"\n\nNow my entire family is completely ignoring me.

If you don't want to look like the bad guy, fake it for 10mins.  Being left out of plans that center around the kids sounds like a blessing to me.  If you want to spend time with the adults, plan an adult event at your place.  They may not all be able to attend, but they might enjoy the break every once in a while.  However I think you may be a bit self centered to care about that since you can't be bothered to help in a real emergency.

The kids are all in school, how hard can it be to sit there and just make sure they get home & don't burn the house down? \n\nPut on a movie, let them play the xbox -- little to no interaction required.  Was she asking you to help with homework, make sure the chores are done & do a family craft followed by a board game? No, because everyone knows you hate kids.  \n\nYou ABSOLUTELY have the right to not interact with kids, ever, in your life.  You can say no, and that is a complete sentence.  It isn't your fault there was an emergency, but being unwilling to assist in an emergency, your actions tell your family how little they mean to you.  It made the emergency twice as stressful.  Again, not your fault, but this is the result.", "NTA. There are two other siblings in the picture, and your parents. Why couldn't the kids be dropped off with one of them if it was an emergency?

You like one of those exhausting people who wants it both ways. You want to be left alone by the kids, yet complain when they're told the truth about why you want to be left alone.

I get the general no babysitting policy, but your brother going to the hospital and your SIL being stuck in a really tough spot is not a normal situation.

What happened to all of the other family members that have kids/want to be around them? Her husband was in the hospital probably in surgery and being taken care of...she wasn't needed right then and could take a few minutes to find a babysitter.\n\nWhat would she have done if she actually had no family? That's right, she would have had to just deal with it. Take the kids with her, or found some other means to take care of them. Generally, people who are childfree and aren\u2019t teachers and don\u2019t work closely with children don\u2019t generally do research on how to take care of children because they assume the people in their lives won\u2019t suddenly dump them on them.
