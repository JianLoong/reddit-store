I\u2019m a 36 year old lesbian and was trying to socialize when a guy approached me. He told me he was straight and I humored a conversation with him because I used to go when I thought I was straight and maybe he was with friends so no big deal. He went on to tell me that he was there to pick up women and his buddies said it\u2019s the best place to pick up chicks. He asked me about twin flames and proceeded to tell me that his \u201ctwin flame\u201d had a restraining order against him and seemed visibly agitated about it. All of my alarm bells went off and I left the conversation shortly after. Later in the night after watching him creep out other women he tried to start talking to me about twin flames again and I snapped. I told him that he really shouldn\u2019t be at the gay bar and that every other bar in town was made for people like him. It is the one place I can go and feel safe and avoid men like him and he should leave. He didn\u2019t listen to a word I said and saw nothing wrong with himself being there.

As you stated, gay bars are a safe place for the LGBT+ community. A straight man shouldn't be there by himself looking to pick up girls in a *gay bar* where they probably aren't interested in the first place. And that whole twin flame thing is a red flag", "NTA!!! Talk with the bartenders and bouncers to let them know what he's up to. That's not the vibe they're seeking. Having a place to feel safe is all the more pressing as days go by!", "NTA. I'm a queer woman who worked next door to a gay bar, at a gay coffee shop. I was friends with all the staff at the bar next door. We were CONSTANTLY kicking dudes like these out of both spaces. \n\nStraight girls going to gay bars to avoid creepy straight dudes is pretty common. Considering how hard it is as a woman to go out to a bar scene alone I always felt massively protective of them. \n\nNext time, let a security guard or other staff know. They'll keep an eye on em.

That's not cool anywhere. He shouldn't be out in public, period.", "Yikes! Warning bells everywhere! Definitely let the bartenders, management and security know. \n\nNTA.", "NTA you weren't coming from a place of wanting to exclude someone, but were concerned about the people this person would interact with knowing what you know about them.", "NTA\n\nThat gave me the ick. I can't stand when men go to gay bars to pick up women. They are literally not there for you. Hell I'm bisexual and if I'm in a gay bar I'm not their looking for straight men to flirt me.", "NTA.  Gay bars do not exist for straight dudes to go pick up women.  They are there for LGBT people to feel safe.  The guy just hanging out in the bar as a straight person was fine, him treating it like a lady hunting ground was not fine.  He can go to literally any other bar to do that.", "NTA\n\nYou should have told bar staff that he was making you and other women uncomfortable", "NTA\n\nYou didn't give him trouble for simply being a straight guy in a gay bar; you took exception to the guy being a creep in what is supposed to be a safe space.\n\nHonestly this guy seems like \"manosphere\"/pickup artist creep. The whole \"best place to pick up straight chicks is in a gay bar\" phenomenon is a common trope in that community.", "NTA. Like you said, gay bars are safe spaces for LGBT+ and allies.", "NTA. He's a straight creep. And he needs to realize he's not going to convince any girl to be straight. I'm straight and used to go to gay bars with friends but I'd never try to hit on any of the girls and would just go to have fun.", "NTA\n\nThe difference maker was that he admitted that his purpose for being there is \"to pick up chicks\".  You didn't DICTATE to him where he could/couldn't go.  In my mind, you basically told a guy at a vegan market that he's at the wrong place to buy meat.\n\n(Don't overanalyze the analogy, he's just at the wrong place to accomplish his mission).", "NTA, but stay safe OP. He was a walking marinara flag", "NTA-My straight friends and spouse have gone to the gay bar I considered a safe place with me before but not to pick up anyone. They go with me because they know it\u2019s comfortable for all of us there.", "NTA those people do that because they know that girls relaxes a little bit in those environment, I saw it many times.

I worked at a gay bar and restaurant for many years, in several locations and states. \n\n\nAnytime some straight dude would attempt to pick me up , I would tell them I'm a dude want to see my big fat dick?

It is demonstrably dangerous for women to reject men\u2019s advances in alcohol heavy environments, and dude was trolling for women in a space where many women may not be into men, with a bad attitude to boot. He may or may not have had violent intentions but he was a problem waiting to happen.", "NTA", "\"Am I the asshole for trying to dictate who can and can\u2019t be at a gay bar?\"\n\nNormally I'm anti-gate keeping and would knee jerk yes.  When I was traveling for work, one time the bar nearest the hotel was a gay bar, but I sat at the bar and enjoyed myself (Straight and male).  I didn't realize it at first, but whatever.  I had my drink and a meal and left.  I don't feel like I was intruding and would not have appreciated being told to F-off by you.\n\nHowever, this guy is specifically going to a gay bar to hit on lesbians.  I had to google twin flame.  I'm not sure how a straight dude finds one in a lesbian bar, but that's another subreddit.  Maybe that line worked once, 10 years ago.  Anyway, it sounds like he also was getting aggressive with multiple people. Yeah, he needed to leave.  Whatever you specifically told him is less important than the final message: You're being a jackass and need to leave.\n\nGoing with NTA", "NTA\n\nGay or straight, doesn't matter. That fucker is predatory and needs to GTFO. \n\nThanks for saying something!", "NTA.\n\n \"I want to find people who are potentially sexually interested in me... so I will go to a venue where the people I'm sexually interested in are DEFINITELY NOT interested in me!\" \n\nWut. \n\nI'm assuming that you would not have the same issue with a straight man who wasn't being both predatory and a nuisance. If I'm wrong, I'll be compelled to amend my judgment, but it sounds like your issue is his behavior, not his orientation.", "NTA I HATE straight people who think they are entitled to our spaces, it\u2019s one thing if he was there with lgbtq+ friends or was questioning and trying to self reflect to see maybe am I gay/bi whatever but like if your there alone to pick up women that\u2019s a huge red flag to me, with all the straight cis people shooting up gay clubs.", "ESH.\n\n> He asked me about twin flames and proceeded to tell me that his \u201ctwin flame\u201d had a restraining order against him and seemed visibly agitated about it.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think *any* bar in town is a good place for this guy, honestly.

The problem is that a creep was being a creep.  If he takes this act over to another bar and bothers some other woman, that's hardly an improvement.", "Judgement is split:\n\nYTA because he is free to go if he so chooses.\n\nNTA for reacting the way you did. He shouldn't be there to pick up chicks. He should go to enjoy time with friends. Something like that happens again, tell the bartender/bouncer/security about him and get him thrown out.
