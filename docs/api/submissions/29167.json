He needs stability.", ">I have other older siblings that live 2 provinces away but then I won't get to see him or he wouldn't get to see his mother and that breaks my heart, I don't want to do that.\n\nRight now his mother is hurting him more than she is helping. Would it not be better for him to have stability and family and a good school and occasional visitation from his mother? Could you not move too and maintain a strong connection to him? \n\nNot everyone has the resources to raise a child regardless of want. You may need to do what is best for him and best for you. NTA for recognizing what you can do and working with that. At this point you have done a great deal to make sure he is cared for and safe.", "NTA.\n\nThis should never have been your burden to carry.  Your nephew will be better off with stability, instead of the chaos your sister brings in to his -- and your -- life.", "CAS will help so much if you contact them and they may be able to help you make the best decision.. you've done so much to keep him safe for so long but if you can't keep doing it, you owe it to him to make the right decision for his future (which other people have said too.. might be having him go to other siblings). They exist to help the child and are not as scary as people think!\n\nBTW you can apply to have the CCB payments if he stays with you.

Your nephew won't have to forgive, he will100% thank you for getting him to your other siblings if they can provide more stability at this time. You do not have to feel any guilt for making sure he is in the best place he can be. That is called LOVE. Your sister actually did this when she made sure you were there to make sure you were taking care of him instead of her. You can pass the torch up the line to better places. Just to reassure you: you're taking care of all three of you by making sure both you and your nephews needs are met if your sister can't take care of him right now.", "NTA one bit, like some has said here, I think you'll need to involve in the social service here, your health is your priority, won't do any good to that kid if your health both physically and mentally are unstable.

You need to put on your metaphorical oxygen mask.\n\nTo be completely honest, you would be the asshole if you keep your nephew.   You aren\u2019t stable enough to take the best care of him, and he should be far away from his mother until she gets herself cleaned up.  \n\nDon\u2019t think of it as abandoning your nephew.  Change your frame of mind.  You are being unselfish by giving him the best life he can have, even if you\u2019ll miss him.", "NTA. Oh, my friend, I am so sad for you and your nephew :(\n\nAs the child of a toxic narcissist, I can say that I would MASSIVELY have preferred having my toxic parent removed from my life vs \u201chaving my mom around\u201d. (In fact I often begged my dad to divorce her and take me with him. No dice.) I\u2019m 41 now, a grown-ass adult, and my mother\u2019s selfish, narcissistic behavior/treatment towards me in my childhood STILL affects me. I\u2019m STILL working through the trauma.\n\nDo not for a second think that your nephew would \u201cwant\u201d to \u201chave his mom in his life\u201d. He\u2019s 6 and that is (unfortunately) plenty old enough to realize how horrible one\u2019s parent(s) is/are. You\u2019re an absolute hero and saint for the care you already gave to him. He probably doesn\u2019t WANT to \u201csee his mother\u201d. He already knows that she abandoned him, even if he doesn\u2019t know why/what she\u2019s doing.\n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t have a solution for you :( I think it\u2019d be best for YOUR mental and physical health to have custody of him assigned to one of your older siblings, but I totally get that you would miss him - you\u2019ve got a bond with him now. The only other solution would be that MAYBE if you officially got custody of him (and JUST him, not the other kids) you could figure out a routine with him that would save your sanity, as you\u2019d be at peace in a way, since you wouldn\u2019t be worrying about his mother any more (as he\u2019d be yours legally.)\n\nI can only offer internet hugs to you and hope you come out of the other side of this doing okay. I\u2019m adopted myself (was adopted at birth) and luckily I had ONE good adoptive parent - my dad was the best. He managed to keep me sane during the worst of my adoptive mother\u2019s abuse.\n\nYou don\u2019t HAVE to be your nephew\u2019s saint, though. I know you love him and want the best for him, but it is NOT \u201cright\u201d for you to destroy yourself just to save him.\n\nAsk your older siblings. See if you could write out a \u201cfuture plan\u201d if you DO get permanent custody.\n\nCaveat: do NOT feel bad for your sister beyond the pity afforded to addicts (I am one myself, currently in recovery.) Addicts will remain addicts unless they WANT help, and your sister is trash because she is willingly choosing drugs over her responsibility: her son. I don\u2019t have children, but I have four pets, and they are my responsibility. I cannot relapse, because they rely on me and I need to take proper care of them. It\u2019s the same for human children, and your sister is willingly and happily shirking her duty to her child.\n\nI wish you and your nephew the best. You are already his hero for providing love and care for him. <3", "NTA\n\nAs a 36year old man that grew up with a mother that was addicted to meth for all his life except a few years of his twenties, it is for the best that he doesn\u2019t see her for a while if she\u2019s like this. She may not pose a direct physical threat to him but the threat of emotional and psychological damage is real. She will constantly be missing anything important to him and eventually will likely be gone on one bender or another for days weeks or months at a time. The abandonment issues are also best case scenario, if she decides she wants custody and manages to act well enough long enough to win it any number of awful things could be done to him by the people she associates with. \n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s no scenario for his future that isn\u2019t going to hurt, but seeing her (or rather, missing seeing her and knowing the drugs are more important) will only make it worse in my opinion.", "Well, that took a strange, unexpected turn.", "not an asshole mother to your kids\n\nbut it would be fine for that kid to hate you forever", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You seem to want to be with him. Growing attached to a kid is understandable. IDK about Canada, but it seems a judge would be willing to let a relative keep him. Then you\u2019d get the child tax, correct? You might also be eligible for other assistance. \n\nAsk yourself if he really needs to see his mom in her condition. Tell her she\u2019s welcome to come see him, call or whatever. You feel bad because you\u2019re worn out physically and emotionally. \n\nTry to start getting it resolved and you\u2019ll feel better. Look into what has to be done, and start working on it. Be ready for the possibility that she might never get better. If another sibling is willing to give him a home, it might be easier than you starting from scratch. Whoever takes him needs to take legal steps so your sister can\u2019t just take him away to another bad situation. \n\nTry to clear your head and think it over for a few days.
