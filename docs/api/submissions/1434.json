You could send a card if that would help you connect / express sympathy without putting yourself in a vulnerable position.", "NTA. \n\nShe mentally and emotionally abused you and you have every right to stay no contact.", "NTA - I am a recovering alcoholic, it took me to nearly lose a relationship with my gf to wake up and get help. If she's going to choose alcohol over her relationship with you it is completely selfish and unreasonable for her to demand your support. That's her role as a parent, which she's clearly reneged on.\n\nAlso alcohol is a depressant. I'm 2 weeks into recovery and while I have good days and bad, my depression has never reached the levels it did while I was drinking.", "NTA. She's been terrible enough you PANICKED at the thought of talking to her. She's an adult, she chose to be untreated for her alcoholism and mental illness despite having a child depending on her. You were barely even a teenager when she decided not to contact you again.  NO  judgment from me for not opening yourself up to more abuse from her. Go get her a card from the store, a nice generic sympathy card. Tell her you are sorry to hear about her father and she has your condolences, mail it, and then go on with your life. She doesn't get to expect sympathy from a child she treated so poorly. Take care of your mental health and keep healing.", "NTA.  What your mother did is a form of abuse, and you\u2019re reacting as someone dealing with trauma.  Contacting her would be detrimental to you.  Don\u2019t do it, and don\u2019t feel bad about putting your needs first for a mother who couldn\u2019t be bothered to contact you for years.", "nta. it is not the responsibility of the child to emotionally support the parent, especially when you\u2019re a minor, and especially when your mother has not been emotionally connected or supportive to you. a kind way to express that to her and your dad might be something like \u201ci am sorry for what you\u2019re going through, but i am not able to be there for you emotionally in this situation, and i am not ready to have a relationship with you again.\u201d"]}
