It would involve rewriting the ADA.  One reason is because dogs don\u2019t have any public access rights.  The disabled handler has the right to bring their service dog with them. Disabled people may not legally be required to jump through hoops non disabled people have to. So, any registration would end up having to have a photo ID for the handler, as well as the dog.
