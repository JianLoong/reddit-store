My mom had two kids with her first husband and he died when they were 6 and 7 years old. Two years later my parents meet and I came along a year later. I also had a younger sister but she was stillborn at 33 weeks. For as long as I can remember I have always felt like my mom's other kids didn't like me or care about me.

My mom would assure me they loved me. When I was younger I used to get very upset and she told me it was silly to think they didn't care about me or want me at all. She said it was just the age gap and their ages at the time. But she made promises that if something ever happened to her and my dad I would still have them in my life.\n\nThey never claimed my dad as part of their family either. He was always just mom's husband when they spoke about him.\n\nThree years ago both of my parents ended up in the hospital with Covid and neither of mom's kids stepped in like mom said they would.

They didn't speak to me at all during that time and for me, it was when I really started questioning what my mom was saying.\n\nBoth mom's kids now have children. We see them a little more because they want their kids to know mom. But nothing has changed regarding how they are with me. I sometimes get a hi and that's about it.\n\nI mentioned to mom that I wanted to ask them if they actually cared about or loved me and she told me not to and there was no point, because I know they do and I should trust her. But I guess being older means I can see stuff that she doesn't want me to see and can put stuff together a little better. I wanted to hear from them once and for all because now they're parents so surely if my mom is right then they would be more willing to show it?

I looked them right in the eye and asked if either of them loved me or even cared about me at all.

I\u2019m guessing it breaks her heart that her first two children don\u2019t love you the way she does, and she has created a fiction for herself to help herself cope with that painful reality. Unfortunately you are co-opted into that, but consider that it really isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about her.

If/when you do...\n\n* Don't be afraid to speak up after a few sessions if you don't feel a particular therapist is the right one for you.\n* Definitely do not let your mom control the therapist. Say that you want to speak with the therapist in private. Even as a minor, your sessions need to be private, but you will want to hear the therapist confirm that they will honor and respect your privacy and not share anything with your parents without your permission.\n* Possible benefits:\n\n1. hearing someone tell you that you are sane and normal and were seeing things pretty clearly\n2. having someone acknowledge how your mom's efforts affected you and hurt you\n3. confirming that you are not to blame and did nothing wrong\n4. helping you (re)learn to believe in your own ability to discern life/reality\n5. gaining ideas on how to deal with your mom going forward (whether she improves or not)\n6. facilitating talking with your mom and/or dad about this and possibly having conversations to help them open their eyes more and learn how to deal with this in more healthy ways and be more supportive of you.\n\n* With or w/o a therapist, talk with your dad. Ask him for his perspective. Ask him if he tried to get your mom to be more honest or why he never talked with you directly.\n\nWhenever there's a post here about a parent or stepparent who the children to all play \"happy family,\" the (step)parent seems to always pick one child or another that they blame when the myth is busted. Either the child who can't bond or the child who is left out.

Your mom likely didn't want to shatter the image of loving siblings. Being related doesn't guarantee love or care from others automatically. That sucks for you and I'm sorry you're having to deal with that now. That being said, better to know now than hear it years later and probably at a bad point in your life. Doesn't mean you're any less of a person.", "First of all, NTA.\nSecond  of all, I wish there were a hug react instead of thumbs up, because you deserve some hugs right now.\n\nThird... I'm not going to defend what your mom did, but I'm going to share my experience as a person in a similar role to your father. My husband and I met after his previous relationship was over, and he had a preteen daughter. I have always been nervous that my daughter's existence would be annoying or perceived as inconvenient by her half sister. Everyone told me what your mother did: it'll all be fine, she'll love her. They're still siblings, just give it time. And you know what? They were right, it turns out that my stepdaughter loves my kid, and wants to be a part of our lives, and I'm pretty sure she'd be there for her sister in a pinch. \n*BUT* (and this is why I hope this comment isn't salt in the wound) there were never any guarantees it would work out this way. And if my daughter had asked before it became clear whether her sister loved her and would be there for her, I would have repeated what everyone else had said. And it would have been wishful thinking. It's impossible to know, and it's so hard to know what to say.\n\nFourth, your half siblings seem old enough (having children of their own) to understand how you must feel, and to reflect on their role in your life, and I am concerned that they sound like sociopaths.", "NTA and ESH but you. To hell with those people and your mom should have straightened all this out earlier. She couldn't force them to love you but she could've forced them to treat you better. That would never fly in my household growing up. I'm so sorry.", "OP, I feel awful for you. I don't understand why people with kids get married, move in together, etc if their kids don't get along. I realize that sibs don't always get along in an intact family, but with a blended family - you have a choice not to do this to your kids. Why are these parents so selfish / delusional??? Aren't the kids supposed to come first?", "NTA. Your mom lied to you. I'm sure she wanted that to be the truth, and you knew it wasn't, and it was hurtful of her to deny your reality.

They're all your age right now and he's 6 and literally looks at all of them like God's. When they get aggravated with him it breaks my heart cuz he looks up to them so much. Your mom is TERRIBLE for turning this around on you. She has NO right to be mad at you for getting the truth you deserved that much and you deserved to hear it from her. She should be mad at the older two because half sibling is still a sibling it's not like youre a step sibling this dynamic is fucking DISGUSTING. you deserve better all the way around.

Idc if this is harsh but wake up, people like that, that admit, to their brother! They never really cared or loved you is next level socio.

Sticking up for yourself? \nShe hasn't supported you through this and told off her other kids for being cruel little gremlins.", "NTA, because she was trying to hide the facts that she knew.

I understand every parent wants their kids from the 1st marriage/romantic relationship to get along and be close to kid(s) from the current relationship but it doesn't always happen.

My half siblings range from 7-16 years younger than I am.  My relationship with my siblings is decent.\n\nI can understand your mom's kids' feelings, but only to a certain point.  Not viewing your dad as their parent is normal.  Not viewing you as their family- well they feel how the feel but they could at least be kind to you.  Your mom is a raging asshole for trying to hide all this from you.  Your mom's kids could have been a lot kinder in their delivery of how they feel about you.\n\nAt this point I'd consider asking your dad if you can go to counseling to help you figure out how you want to deal with this.  You don't have to consider them your siblings if they don't consider you their brother.

Try not to get in an argument, just let her know one way or another that you don't buy it.", "Put himself in the shoes of the woman, who instead of being upset her elder kids would tell OP they don\u2019t care about him at all is mad at him for *asking* because now she can\u2019t continue to lie to him and herself? \n\nSure. Ok. \n\nMom is the problem here. Not the siblings. Not OP. Mom.", "Life is complicated. Families are complicated. Mothers are complicated. Glad you have your clarity. OP, you are 16 and will have a relationship with your mother for the rest of her and your life.", "Therapy is overpriced and how is a 16 year old to afford 300 an hour?", "Sure. All that is true. AND: people can recognize that family members can make bad decisions and be wrong and you don\u2019t need to side with them or endorse that to still love them. \n\nAlso, people can decide that family members are choosing to hurt them over and over and that it is healthier for them to have distance from that family member. \n\nThe point of the fact that families are complicated is that there is no one right way to respond to your family. And no one odd obligated to deal with that shit just because they are family. But you for sure don\u2019t need to pretend like a family member hasn\u2019t harmed you and offer them more compassion and respect than they offer you.", "If they have insurance it could be covered. I've been going for 3 years and haven't paid for it once.\n\nEdit: sorry my copay the 1st year was $25 then I switched insurances and it became fully covered.", "Where did I say anything like what you\u2019re ascribing to me? I said try to be empathetic to your mother while doing what you need to do. Try to understand why she acted the way she did, now that your eyes are open. And govern yourself accordingly, with that in mind. Realizing that OP is 16 years old, and has decades ahead of them with their mother. Seems like half the comments here are of the cut off all contact with this gaslighting monster variety, which is insane and counterproductive from strangers", "And I\u2019m telling you that a child rose parent is literally gaslighting them and then punishing them for not just accepting that didn\u2019t owe that parent empathy.", "It\u2019s a hell of a thing to think you\u2019re in a position to tell a 16 year old asking for advice in a situation like this not to have any empathy. Easy to say from the cheap seats. It\u2019s not the rest of your life at issue.", "All I\u2019m trying a 16 year old is that he doesn\u2019t owe his mother the labour if \u201cseeing it from her side\u201d. \n\nPeople are allowed to be hurt and angry and work their way through those emotions in a healthy way. He is shooed to ask his mom (the actual adult) to see this from HIS side. And just because he dies any if this doesn\u2019t mean it will harm his king term relationship with his mom. \n\nAs a mom of a now adult man, it is NOT my sins responsibility to guest harm that *I* cause. It is mine. He is showed to be hurt and tell me so, and he\u2019s allowed to ask me to take accountability for hurting him or impose boundaries if he needs them. That\u2019s what I want for him because I want my kids to thrive and have emotional intelligence and because I\u2019m the adult/elder who should be doing my own work.", "I get the feeling your mom already knew the answers to your questions, but didn\u2019t want them aired publicly and ruin her vision of the perfect family. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour mother has been lying to you. To make matters worse, now that you have confirmed her lies, she is manipulating you into apologizing for ... god knows what.\n\nI'm sorry that you have to deal with such a deceitful, manipulative mother. Unfortunately, she does not appear to be trustworthy.", "NTA- You seem like a smart and very sweet young man. Put your heart and mind into something that makes you happy and don't worry about what your half siblings think of you. I know it's easier said than done but none of this is your fault. \n\nI'm sorry your mom lied to you for so long and caused you to doubt yourself but now you know the truth. Take that truth and go forward. What you did was brave and I feel like that will take you where you want to go in life. Wishing you all the happiness.", "OP\u2014I am sorry you had to go through this .Parents  are not perfect .Your Mom wanted a fantasy of a Happy Family more than she wanted to honor you and your honest question .She let you down .It may take time for her to ever say she is sorry .She might never apologize .Try to take whatever is good in your relationship with her but also look for others who can be your \u201c chosen family \u201c ..Sometimes FRIENDS are much better than Family .", "NTA by what you want to do and your feelings but I wouldn\u2019t ask them anything until you have had some therapy. \n\nI have a feeling they were/are jealous that you had a father. They lose their dad and then 2 years later there mum is married with a new child. So here they are seeing all the love and support they felt excluded from. \n\nYes your dad gave them all the love of a father as they grew. But it wasn\u2019t their father. If there father didn\u2019t die then you both wouldn\u2019t be in the picture.\n\nI\u2019m assuming they never got therapy to deal with their feelings.\n\nI can understand what your mum was trying to do. But obviously it was the wrong thing to do. So I\u2019m actually curious to what she said to her other children.\n\nI would perhaps go about it a different way. And be a friend. And hopefully that may the start of a relationship.", "NTA she has a rose tinted view of family.\n\nIt\u2019s been clearly proven she is wrong.\n\nYou could have been made an orphan when your parents were sick, your siblings couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nI\u2019d ask to clear the air with your mother and draw a line under the lies she\u2019s made.

It\u2019s disrespectful for her to lie to you all these years knowing that your half siblings don\u2019t see you as part of their family. She has no right to be angry for you asking them for the truth. She is the one living in a fantasy world that they care when they don\u2019t but you had to live in the real world and took the brunt of their coldness. I would honestly match their indifference though. Show no interest in their lives or their kids. If your mother tries to force you to speak with them, say you don\u2019t have siblings or nieces/nephews as they are not family to you if you are not family to them. Concentrate on your other relationships and friendships. Ones that matter because they don\u2019t.", "You are NOT THE AH  Your siblings are. Your mom is mad because she knew all along and got caught in a lie. She'll get over it eventually. At least you know the truth and know n9t to trust them.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is in big-time denial.  She KNOWS they don't love you and they never have.  I will never understand why some kids are so mean towards an innocent half or step-sibling, but they are.  Your mother's insistence that everything was fine didn't work.  She should have tried counseling.  \n\nI think some people are born selfish.", "Nta", "I'm really very sorry that you have been so disappointed. It sucks. It also sucks that your mom made these promises to you--maybe because she believed them, maybe because she thought saying it would make it true, or maybe because she just couldn't manage the truth. You have to understand that this is not about you, though. They don't know you. They don't want to. Whatever happened when your mom and dad married caused them to have these feelings. Maybe your parents handled it badly--which is likely given how she handled things with you. The fact is, the reason they don't want to know you has everything to do with that marriage and nothing with you. Your options are limited. You can ask them to get acquainted so that you can have a relationship with them, even if it's not close. You can get acquainted with their children and possibly grow closer that way. Or you can accept that things are they way they are. Whatever you do, I suggest seeing a therapist, because this is undoubtedly causing you a great deal of pain and making you feel personally rejected. Again, I stress to you, this is not about you as a person at all. NTA", "Nta. What\u2019s pathetic is your mom had an opportunity to address this so many times over the years, to get counseling, to reason w them before it became normal to them. It\u2019s crazy though because you are siblings & they are being ridiculous & cruel. She knew the truth & did nothing. Your brothers just broke your soul & she\u2019s mad at you??", "Depending on who you ask, I have 0,1,2,3,4,5,or 6 siblings, and all are justifiably correct answers. Life is fucking weird like that.", "Mom is an AH for lying to and gaslighting op. Older sibs are AHs for being adults behaving like children and not taking care of their kid brother when his parents couldn't. This is definitely not a case of no AHs, OP is NTA.", "Seems like mom would have tried harder to correct older kids\u2019 perceptions and encourage them to accept you more if she wanted this more than anything. Your half-siblings were still at an age (8 and 9) where more effort in this area could have made a difference", "Look at the stats of how many kids are actually covered under insurance in America. It is small. Rich privilege."]}
