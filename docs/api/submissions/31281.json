{"id": 31281, "submission_id": "17yuiw7", "title": "AITA for going against my mom's wishes when I spoke to her kids?", "selftext": "My mom was married before she married my dad. My mom had two kids with her first husband and he died when they were 6 and 7 years old. Two years later my parents meet and I came along a year later. I also had a younger sister but she was stillborn at 33 weeks. For as long as I can remember I have always felt like my mom's other kids didn't like me or care about me. They used to say they had one sibling and would make a very big point of pointing out the half when I was mentioned (or my sister but she wasn't brought up a lot in that context).\n\nWhenever they were together they would get along so well but with me they would hardly say a thing to me and when they did it was strained. My mom would assure me they loved me. When I was younger I used to get very upset and she told me it was silly to think they didn't care about me or want me at all. She said it was just the age gap and their ages at the time. But she made promises that if something ever happened to her and my dad I would still have them in my life.\n\nThey never claimed my dad as part of their family either. He was always just mom's husband when they spoke about him.\n\nThree years ago both of my parents ended up in the hospital with Covid and neither of mom's kids stepped in like mom said they would. I actually ended up having to leave the state to stay with my dad's parents who I barely knew. Both my mom's kids lived local enough and were living in their own places (her son lives with his wife). They didn't speak to me at all during that time and for me, it was when I really started questioning what my mom was saying.\n\nBoth mom's kids now have children. We see them a little more because they want their kids to know mom. But nothing has changed regarding how they are with me. I sometimes get a hi and that's about it.\n\nI mentioned to mom that I wanted to ask them if they actually cared about or loved me and she told me not to and there was no point, because I know they do and I should trust her. But I guess being older means I can see stuff that she doesn't want me to see and can put stuff together a little better. I wanted to hear from them once and for all because now they're parents so surely if my mom is right then they would be more willing to show it? Mom made me question myself a lot when she would assure me that they did love me and I wanted to put my mind at ease that I'm not just really self-conscious with poor self worth.\n\nThey were both at our house last weekend and I asked them if they would be honest for a second. I looked them right in the eye and asked if either of them loved me or even cared about me at all. They confirmed what I always knew deep down, that they never loved or cared about me or thought of me as their brother or family.\n\nMy mom is really angry that I asked and she said it was disrespectful to ignore her wishes.

Every mother wants their kids to get along and love each other.  But what she did to you was make you question your own judgement, intuition and ability to understand genuine human behaviors through sound cognitive reasoning skills....all for the sake of maintaining an illusion of 'happy family' that didn't exist.  \n\nThat's a dangerous thing to do to a kid in the formative years; it's difficult to trust yourself when your caregivers gaslight your developing brain.  And now she's pissed you didn't trust her lie?  Lame. \n\nGlad you were smart/brave enough to trust your own assessment skills and find out for yourself the truth of the situation.  Ignore the half-siblings and move forward in life without that baggage.", "NTA. It was brave of you to ask them. Your mom may be mad but you didn't do anything wrong. You wanted to know where you stood with your half siblings. You asked. They told you. NTA", "NTA\n\nyour Mum however is, she knew they didn't like you but was never honest with you.\n\nTBH you are better off without them, only interact with them if it is totally necessary.\n\nAs for your Mum, you should tell her it was wrong of her to lie to you all these years and go LC with her as well.", "It sounds to me like your Mom decided to live in a Brady Bunch fantasy. Maybe that just helped her feel better about having another \"family\" after her first husband died. But, you knew the truth because you lived it and just wanted confirmation of that fact, so NTA. The truth is the truth, no matter what anyone says. And, I'm sorry you experienced this isolation and lack of connection growing up. I think your \"steps\" were angry and, unfortunately, took it out on you. Their loss. Truly.", "NTA - you're an adult and it's your relationship, or lack of, with them. you have every right to address concerns that you have and to ask questions.", "NTA Your mother is just plain wrong on this. She may have been trying to be kind, but in effect it wasn't. The nagging suspicion that what you could see (rather than what your mother told you) was true was something you had to live with, not her.\n\nShe wanted you to live in ignorant bliss but as reality was staring you in the face that was never possible. Her other kids weren't even pretending to care for you. They were just polite. If that's all you were expecting, that's fine -- no disappointments. Your mother was inadvertently setting you up for a big disappointment at some stage. The more you believed her the bigger the fall would have been. You were in a way lucky that you had your own suspicions and had built up no big hopes.\n\nExplain this to your mother and tell her that you think it's better that it is out in the open. You can't live based on a lie anyway -- case in point, they weren't there for you as she said they would be when your parents were in hospital. It's better to have a cordial relationship based on realitiy than there always being an awkward gap between your expectations and how things actually are.", "NTA your mother sees what she did as creating a happy family. \n\nShe\u2019s delusional and, quite frankly what she actually did was abusive and toxic. She basically gaslit you for your entire life. She made you think that your own feelings and instincts were invalid. She basically made you question your perspective on the world and your instincts about the people around you. That\u2019s super abusive and dangerous to do with a child. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her an apology and if I were you I\u2019d tell her you\u2019d like to attend family therapy with her so that she can understand the damage she\u2019s done and you can begin the long process of undoing it.", "She is your mum this is what she wants more than anything to be true she has had this dream in her head that one day you will all love each other and now by asking you have shattered her dreams of one big happy family. Now she has to come to tearms with the sad reality it will never happen she is grieving a family she had built up in her head that really didn't exist.", "I mean, what did you hope to gain from this?

I have spent years questioning whether I need serious help to read things better and feeling crazy because what mom said was not adding up for me. Knowing what I know now, and hearing it from their mouths, it helps me see I'm not that bad.", "Thanks. I'm glad I now at least know I'm not crazy or bad at reading things.", "I still live with my mom since I'm 16, so I can't really do that.", "Technically we're half siblings and not steps. My dad would be their step but because we share a parent (mom) it makes us half. But yeah. It's okay. I'm glad I know for real now and don't need to question myself any more or risk hoping for more.", "I'm technically not an adult yet. I'm 16.", "I think there's also part of her that doesn't want it to be true also. Like I know it's gotta suck for her to see the older kids from her first marriage not give a shit about her kid(s) from the second marriage. But all she was doing was making me really question if I was losing my mind.", "I understand that she wanted this more than anything. I also kind of figured that's why she was so sure with me, she wanted it to be real more than anything. But it was driving me crazy at the same time.", "I wanted to put my own head at ease. For years I have felt like I'm basically crazy because mom says one thing, I see things another way, and she was always so sure, but I was twisting myself up inside at times trying to figure stuff out.\n\nHad they said yes I would have wanted to figure out if there was a reason for the distance then and whether I could do something. But I'm not sorry I asked. It feels better to know the truth.", "Yes, what she did was gaslight you. You\u2019ve been gaslit your whole life and as soon as you can I hope you seek therapy to undo the massive damage she\u2019s done to your self confidence and trust in your own instincts. She abused you to maintain the delusion of the happy family that didn\u2019t exist", "She still needs to know what she did was wrong", "Yes! My bad.", "Ah okay, definitely edit and state that in your post! Still NTA though, they are valid questions. I think she's probably more upset that you know and she could be just misdirecting that right now.", "Yeah. I think you probably have the right of it. Your mother may be the main one who is having trouble dealing with the truth -- but that doesn't stop what she was saying to you causing *you* confusion and trouble.  It isn't fair of her to delude herself at your expense, and she can't bring what she wants into being through wishful thinking and insisting that it is already true.", "I can understand but like the old saying goes the truth sometimes hurts. She will come around slowly but she will get there. I found my biological father side of the family after doing a heritage dna test they seemed happy to talk to me then five minutes later I was blocked by a sister and a brother it hurt but I moved on its tough you sound super strong.", "I think you need to work on yourself a bit. I understand it's really difficult and I sympathize a lot with the situation. Being able to trust yourself and your feelings is such an important part of life and you'll exist a lot happier once you can get there.", "I might look at therapy in the future. But for now I think I'll just try to make it through the next couple of years.", "I'm not sure she'll ever agree but I do. It's dangerous to have someone question their own mind as much as I was because of her choices.", "I don't know that my mom will come around. If anything I feel like she will just double down that I was wrong to ask and that I disobeyed her.", "I think it will get easier now that I can fully shut out what mom has been saying. But I need to work on stuff anyway just not as badly as if I had been crazy all along.", "It's going to be very tough for her to give up her dream of a perfect family but I hope she can finally move on from it."]}
