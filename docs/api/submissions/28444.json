I don\u2019t know what part of Catholicism your brother is getting a priesthood in, but an increasing number of them today preach a lot more hate than love.  Which might be where this snitching and devil seducing bit came in.  \n\nThere\u2019s two main paths you can take here - coming from an atheist/agnostic/who knows what myself:\n- Go through being the alter boy. Yes you would be lying since you\u2019re not religious but near everyone in religion is living some kind of lie.  Jesus never judged and if he does exist he\u2019s not going to care if you didn\u2019t mean it. Do it as an act of caring for your brother at this time. Familial love, sacrifice, that\u2019s what religion is about anyhow. \n\n- Don\u2019t and make some kind of excuse. Anxiety might not work, but if you think it will try it.  Develop stress nosebleeds and state you\u2019re worried it\u2019ll take away from his big day. I\u2019d be tempted to break a leg or arm myself. \n\n- A third path exists if you want to burn bridges. You can go to the bishop or whomever is handling the ceremony and confess that you are troubled because you are not a practicing catholic (are Unitarian or Episcopal or whatever) and your brother and your parents want you to take part in the ceremony. The more you act troubled about tainting the ceremony and that he would begin his priesthood in a lie the better. That won\u2019t go well with the powers that be but you\u2019ll also cause some drama with your family so that\u2019s a nuclear option\n\nAnd if you choose to go forward with telling your family that you are an atheist, good luck. Given how strongly religious your family is, it might be safer to just say you\u2019re not catholic anymore. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to just have them think you believe in god just not in Catholicism.  \n\nTake care, I hope things work out whatever way you go.", "NTA\n\nTell them this is a matter of conscience -- your conscience.", "NTA, your beliefs are yours, your families beliefs are theirs. If everyone could just respect this, our world would be a beautiful place. I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to serve in the church this way with your beliefs. Your family probably wants you back on with God and think this is a stepping stone.", "NTA.\n\nOrdination is some pure religious stuff that has zero equivalent or meaning in civilian life.\n\nIf your bro wanted you to be there for their wedding, I'd tell you to go. But that's not the case. Your family has still not accepted the fact that you're not a believer like they are, and try to bring you in the church in some desperate attempt to make you a believer. \n\nI don't know which country you're from, and how deep the religion runs in the society you live in, but don't let them bully you into religion with some Satan crap or emotional blackmail.", "As a atheist in a christian family who goes to a christian school I feel sorry for you, also I haven't told my family either only my best friend", "My father was dying when I was 13. My father expected all his children to get confirmed in the Catholic Church.\n\nI already knew that I wasn\u02bbt a Catholic. I knew it would be a lie. \n\nBut, to my sense of morals, the greater sin was not to do this for my father. So, I went and lied to the Bishop\u02bbs face. It\u02bbs never bothered me.\n\nDoing something that my father, who only saw photos of the confirmation and died a couple weeks later, wanted was more important to me. If I had to go through some ritual that was meaningless to me...I still think it was the right decision. And, honestly, I don\u02bbt give a fuck if any Catholic disagrees with me.\n\nThis is a decision you have to make for yourself. Maybe you feel too strongly to do it. Maybe you don\u02bbt want to make a mockery of your family\u02bbs deeply held beliefs.\n\nOr maybe you do something meaningless to you to make them happy.\n\nI will say that I don\u02bbt think very much of your brother as a priest. Even if it\u02bbs not in a confessional, there are discussions with a priest that should be confidential. Also, he\u02bbs pretty damn judgmental for someone who\u02bbs supposed to represent Christ.\n\nI hope he gets the self-righteous stick out of his ass.

I feel like there would be an expectation for me to receive communion which would also mean that I'd have to go to confession and to do that I'd actually have to be sorry for anything I confess", "Great answer. The only thing I'd add to the OP is that if you're committed to atheism, you need to build up the ability to handle these debates with your family in ways that don't escalate the conflict. It won't be easy, but you gotta stand on your own two feet.", "I was surprised myself that he was upset. I am pretty close with my brother. He and I went for a road trip the last time he visited home where I told him that I was at least questioning catholicism.", "Yeah, sounds to me like dad is triangulating.

I also struggle with anxiety which is a big reason why I stopped when I was younger", "It's not just an elaborate theatre. Once you put a foot in, people will keep guilt tripping you in going in deeper and deeper.\n\nThat's why they insist. They don't give a shit about OP's feeling, they're just working the numbers for their church, consciously or not.", "That's true. Moving would definitely soften the effects of the aftermath. I love them all to bits, though. I'd be scared to lose them which plays a big part in my hesitation to tell them", "Buddy, you have no idea. Sometimes I wonder if I'll just elope, lmao", "I was an altar boy for ten years when I was younger. As I got older I got more anxiety, partially to do with issues I had with the parish priest at the time. If I were to altar serve I'd feel like I'd be pretending to be something I'm not. But anxiety is one of the biggest factors", "I actually don't attend church anymore and haven't been to confession in years. I do agree that I need to tell them but I was really hoping for after the ordination. That way it's less of an issue, if that makes any sense", "I understand 100%. I will be attending and have offered in other ways to help.

It only applies when it works for them it seems", "As a guest would be fine. I've even offered to help in other ways. I'm happy to go, less happy to be an altar boy", "i've found that if you treat this like you're doing them a favor, it helps.", "I'm catholic (albeit not the best practitioner). You cant have communion unless you went through baptism and the first communion. You also have to go to confession and pray for forgiveness. You don't pray or even believe in God or a god. Doing any of this is hypocritical to both of your beliefs.", "If you're not a Catholic, you don't have to confess a thing, nor do you have anything to be sorry for or to participate in any religious ceremony if you don't want to.\n\nThat said, depending on how you look at it, it's either sacrilege to perform the function as a non believer, or it's a kindness that you be there for your brother on his big day. If you're genuinely not sure what to do, I'd talk to the priest overseeing the ceremony for his thoughts, and go from there. If you are certain of what you want to do, then you know what to do.", "You've got it right there. You know that, to participate fully in your brother's ordination, you would have to lie to him and your family. You're very aware that a valid confession requires at least imperfect contrition. Go with your gut, and remind your parents of their catechism while you're at it. \n\nDoes your family attend an ICKSP parish?\n\nEdit: To anyone asking \"Why does it matter if OP lies, if he doesn't believe it anyway?\" \n\nWould all of you cheerfully lie about something that would devastate your family just to attend a wedding? Devastate them not just in their current life, but in the eternal life they believe in? That's not something that AITA tends to approve of. \n\nAn ordination is far more important to devout Catholics like OP's family than a wedding. Receiving Communion in a state of mortal sin is a sacrilege. \n\nI'm not going to debate this with anyone.", "NTA. I would recommend asking to speak confidentially to a priest involved in the ordination ceremony. Tell them the truth and that you don't want to turn a happy event for your brother into an argument about your religious beliefs.\n\nOr speak to your brother again and say \"Hey, there's stuff going on with me that I don't want you to know, and as someone who's about to be a priest *you need to be able to respect confidentiality*. I would be happy to support your ordination in [XYZ role/way].\" If you're okay with it, tell him he's welcome to pray for you, but you won't be changing your mind.\n\nAnd if he keeps pushing... report him to his bishop. Because the way he's acting about this, I probably wouldn't want him as my priest.", "If you don\u2019t believe in any of it, then why does it matter? Just show up and support your brother. If you really don\u2019t believe in any of it, then who cares if you eat communion or go to confession\u2026 it\u2019s just a cracker and wine and saying a few \u201cI had bad thoughts\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t turn his ordination into everyone needing to know you\u2019re an atheist.", "Would you agree then that the pressure seems to be coming more from your dad rather than from him?\n\nMaybe discuss it again with your brother to see if he is truly upset? Also, maybe he can help with your dad. \n\nMaybe you would consider saying that you feel too old to be an altar boy, you did that when you were a kid?", "Are you sure he is upset, and your parents aren't just saying it?", "Not sure if you've tried already, but the 'mental health/anxiety issues make that something I can't say yes to right now' is probably an easier thing for your family to understand and support than the 'I'm not Catholic' conversation that you are hoping to defer until a more appropriate time. You will know whether this is a better path given the family dynamics far better than I would, of course.", "That's totally understandable! You've got to put yourself first though and do what's best for you. It must be stressful hiding something like this from them. Hopefully they'll care more about you than about what your beliefs may or may not be.", "Elopment is the best solution in so many cases.", "And your family knows you aren't going to church anymore or do you not live close enough for them to know? In any case, you're still not the asshole. You just have to decide whether to listen to them berate you until the ordination or just come clean and let the chips fall where they may.", "If you don't believe in God then presumably you don't believe in Satan either, so it's kind of a non-issue! Not sure how well your family would follow that logic though...", "Excellent advice!", "It took me a second to realize you weren't asking OP if they were a Juggalo or a Hare Krishna/ISKCON!", "But if he doesn\u2019t believe in this stuff, then why does it matter?", "I would agree with you. I don't get to hear from my brother much. The order he is a part of don't allow him to call much. The age thing wouldn't work. My other brothers who will be serving are 27, 25 and 13.", "Surprisingly I live with them. There have been multiple occasions where I could, and probably should, have told them my views but I'm incredibly scared of the rejection that will follow", "Imagine someone asking if they'd be the AH for altar-serving in Juggalo makeup, though?", "It matters to his family, and eventually they will find out he's an atheist. It would be much better for him to disappoint them by not participating than for him to have to admit at some point down the road that he committed a sacrilege during his brother's ceremony. If OP cares about his family then it does matter.", "If you're asking that question, you probably already think it doesn't matter. If it was over anything but religion, I think most Redditors would have a problem with lying about something terribly important.

How will your brother, with whom you are close, remember your role/presence?\n\nPeople might/will say that you chose the most important day in your brother's life to make an issue (for the first time?). What will you do in the future about family weddings, funerals, baptisms, saying grace at meals, weekly Mass, even just to see your brother celebrate Mass?\n\n Consistency of belief and actions is important, and in some situations is the only thing that matters. Is this really one of those situations?  No one can decide that for you. Good luck as you reflect and decide!", "If you aren't attending services, they already know. My guess is they are passive aggressively trying to get you to come back to the fold.\n\nAside from that, I'd suggest you talk to your brother again. It seems odd that someone joining the cloth would be willing to lie to you and then go behind your back. He told you he's fine with your decision, but then tells your parents that he isn't fine and in fact is quite upset. Someone is lying, and if it isn't your parents, then it's him.
