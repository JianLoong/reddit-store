Most responses were not what I was expecting and really gave me a lot to think about.\n\nAs surprised as I was that so many people said to tell Jamie, I did realise it was the right thing to do. So, I texted him and told him that Kate was insisting I dressed a certain way. Jamie called and explained. A couple of months ago, Jamie and Kate were out with a few of his friends (these same friends that I mentioned in my comments are not fond of Kate), and everyone had had a lot to drink. They were talking about how they met their SOs, and the story of Jamie and Kate meeting came up. Apparently during the telling of the story Kate asked Jamie why he had decided to hit on her rather than me, and one of his friends joked that it was because he knew he didn't have a shot with \"the hot one\" - me. Kate asked if this was true, and Jamie having had WAY too much to drink, explained in a way that made it sound kind of true.\n\nHe said he did notice me that night and thought I was attractive, just seeing me. He said he would never have approached me because he knew he would never have a chance with someone like me, so in that way, his friend was right. He said that speaking to Kate was the absolute best outcome because he loves her and plans on spending the rest of his life with her, but even knowing this, Kate has taken this extremely hard, and even though she says she is over it, he's noticed changes in her behaviour that seem to be related to that. He also admitted that he'd been planning to propose to Kate at the party and that is why he'd wanted me to be there, but after hearing this on top of the way she has been handling the situation previously, he won't be doing that anymore.\n\nAfter speaking to Jamie, I called Kate. She admitted that she had tied a lot of her self worth in the fact that she'd finally been picked over me and now it felt like that wasn't true. She apologised for trying to solve her insecurities through me, but also said she wasn't sure she would be able to have me in her life as much as I had been with the way she's been feeling. As hurt as I was, I said I understood. She said she still wanted me to come to the party, since I'd helped organise it and she obviously dropped the absurd dress code, so I will be going to the party. I trust that Kate will communicate her boundaries to Jamie but I don't plan on inviting him to any more events for the foreseeable future.\n\nI'm really sad that I've probably lost a longtime friend over the drunken awkwardness of other people, but I also get that Kate can't help how she feels, and frankly it's for the best not to be in a secret competition. So, yeah, I'm hurt, but I'm going to the party.

That's not something you should say in front of your partner. I hope Kate gets out of this relationship before it gets any more serious and you two can mend fences, but either way be glad he didn't think he had a shot with you and that you can just walk away from this while drama filled mess.", "This is heartbreaking for Kate. You did nothing wrong, and she obviously was out of line with what she asked of you, but I can\u2019t imagine hearing your partner say that would be an easy thing to get over, especially if she\u2019s insecure. She shouldn\u2019t have asked, he shouldn\u2019t have said what he did or exposed her to his friends if they have a history of not treating her well.

And the fact that the SO can still admit that he felt friend was out of his league. If I were Kate I couldn\u2019t help but question if my partner still has a desire/attraction to friend, especially with how he worded things. But this isn\u2019t friends fault. This could be a wake up call that Jamie isn\u2019t the right person for Kate. It\u2019s human to feel insecure about something like this. It\u2019s something that I personally wouldn\u2019t want to live with. Maybe it would be seen as conservative but I personally wouldn\u2019t maintain a personal friend relationship with my friends boyfriend if this revelation came out. And if I were Kate I would probably not want to stay in a situation that made me feel insecure, unsure, and second best.", "Something I'm not getting here, why is he postponing the proposal? Is he doing it to give time to Kate to heal or because he'll reevaluate the relationship? For me it doesn't make much sense to pause his plans, not when Kate is like this, or maybe I'm dense, but... he loves her so much, right? What's the problem?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is so sad. On your first post, I was against Kate, but now that I learned all this new info I think Jamie is the absolute asshole of this story. He's exposing Kate to people who don't like her and now it has truly affected her self-worth. On top of that, he did practically confess to going after Kate as a second fiddle???? I would be destroyed if my partner said that to me, it doesn't matter if the outcome turned out to be \"the best\". I would need to reevaluate the relationship tbh. I truly wish for Kate to dump his ass and dish his friends.\n\nAnd, of course, she shouldn't have done what she did to you. You're completely innocent in this. It does sound like a good idea, for the moment, for her to step back from your friendship with her. Maybe that way she can start to think clearly and will try to mend things later on.\n\nI wish you both the best. And for Jamie to be dumped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: grammar", "I would just let it set a while, Kate seems to have some issues to work through and maybe that will be easier with you not there.\n\nIf it were me, and this is just my personal opinion, I'd tell her that she can take as much time as she needs and I'd be there if she needed me. \n\nShe may come back, she may not, but it may help lift some of the weight.", "Damn. Way to go, Jamie. Hope you lose half of ever sock pair and your beers are always lukewarm.", "If Jamie loves Kate he will be telling his \"friends\" who said that to her where to get off. \n\nNTA", "My sympathies are with Kate but it is doubtful that she can continue her relationship with Jamie.  It kind of reminds me of the play \"Reasons to Be Pretty,\" by Neil LaBute.  Bottom line is that once a woman thinks that her SO does not find her attractive, there is kind of no going back.  I hope Kate finds someone to talk through her problems with and I hope she leaves Jamie because on some level, she is never going to trust him.", "This is unfortunate for everyone involved, but I hope that in time your friendship with Kate will either mend or evolve into a deeper and more honest one, now that all cards are on the table. \n\nI wanted to add that this was so nicely written!

She may not be there now, but the more you fight to be her friend, the more she'll see that you are a whole person - and so is she.", "You know, I read your original post and the update and you of course were right in the refusal to attend because of not wanting your outfit policed. I\u2019ve been asked to \u201ctone it down\u201d before myself and was equally outraged.\nWhile reading your original post I did have the brief thought of well clearly OPs friend feels insecure and OP could just see this as what it is, a friend saying \u201cyou\u2019re prettier than me and I just want to be the pretty one for once tonight\u201d.\nI\u2019ve been on both sides at different points in my life.\nYou aren\u2019t wrong or an AH but I guess there\u2019s always a choice that might not be the \u201cright\u201d one but it\u2019s the empathetic one. But that\u2019s a decision I would make now that I\u2019m 40, not necessarily when I was younger. \nI\u2019m the frumpy wife now and I do feel sometimes less than excited about meeting up with my husbands friends with their smoking hot younger girlfriends who are dressed fashionably.", "Having been Kate, the friend that guys would only talk to in order to talk to my pretty best friend or as a consolation prize, as sad as it is for you, distance is the only way she's going to be able to boost her self-esteem and start to acknowledge that she's stunning in her own light.\n\nSadly I'm not sure there's a future in her relationship with Jamie. His friends don't like her. His friends see her as second best to you and openly comment on this. Jamie admitted he only started talking to her as a consolation prize because he didn't feel like he'd have a shot with you. You two have things in common she doesn't share with him and after she told him you couldn't make it he called you up to make sure you could make it. None of these things are your fault to be clear. It's not your fault straight men are cruel & will openly be harsh to women they don't find attractive or see as less attractive than the one they like. But if Kate decides she'd prefer to wait for the man who came across the room to talk to her because she caught his eye, for a man who doesn't let his friends make her feel second best, for a man who doesn't share things with her prettier best friend, than that would be fair.\n\nI wish you all well going forwards. I have to say though, Jamie doesn't sound great in all this. And it doesn't sound convincing that he's not interested in you at all.", "So Jamie was going to propose to her, but now he's planning not to because he doesn't like how she's acted after HE wrecked her self esteem. What an asshole. Poor Kate", "Sad update. I do hope she gets some therapy because those feelings of inadequacy and distrust aren't going to disappear just because you're no longer there--she'll transfer them to new people. She really needs to address her issue now if she wants to eventually be able to have a happy life with him.\n\nAnd he needs to address his own issues. What a thing to say to someone you're supposed to love!", "As someone who was always looked over for their hot friend, I really feel bad for Kate. That kind of insecurity really fucks with your head.\n\nI hope she leaves Jamie and finds someone who won\u2019t hesitate to pick her first", "I think even aside from what was said that night, the fact that Katie had a confidence boost of someone \u201cpicking\u201d her over you is not healthy (her interpretation of events).\n\nThe way this all came out in the open was unfortunate, but I think that deep insecurity is unhealthy and would have reared its head at some point. I hope she knows that distancing herself from you is not going to solve all her problems. Unless she avoids hot people forever, she\u2019s going to have to work through her feelings of inadequacy.", "Why even go this party? You\u2019re literally going to spend the whole time in this sort of  mind fog of \u201cokay this is the last time I\u2019m allowed to be around these people\u201d or \u201cafter today these people will no longer be my friends or in my life\u201d \nWhy waste you time or possibly make more drama cuz you know those friends who said that will most likely be there", "Am I the only one who thinks Jamie was feeling out his chances with OP when he called her? \u201cI knew I would never have a chance with you, so I talked to her \u2026\u201d and he was going to propose but now isn\u2019t.  Feels like he was leaving that open in case OP would say he was wrong in thinking he had no chance.\n\nUltimately a sad update, I feel for both you and Kate.  I hope she moves on from the relationship and finds someone who treats her with the love and respect she deserves.\n\nI will say that I wouldn\u2019t be too thrilled about my friends forming separate close (hang out alone) relationships with my SO.", "Fuck, I feel for Kate. It's got to feel bad enough already to have a BFF who is universally viewed as \"The hot one\", but finding out that her boyfriend only ever talked to her in the first place because he knew he didn't stand a chance with the hot one? Ouch. Come on jamie, some secrets you take to your grave.", "Many people here are giving Kate a pass and blaming only Jamie. The thing is, she always h\u00e1s been in a competition with you OP. She literally said she tried her self worth because she was picked over you once in her life. This didn't started It with Jamie.That's really sad and toxic for a friendship. And maybe the fact Jamie \"picked\" her played a big part in their relationship. Yes, I think it's best for both of you have a break of each other but I really hope Kate work on her self-esteem issues.", "They both suck, and you're better off without the petty jealousy and drama.", "On the other hand, Jamie told you the truth and didn't try to make himself look good.", "Congratulations on being the hot one OP", "People are so terribly insecure.", "You dodged a bullet because when someone else turns his head that Kate is going to have problems.", "0 re", "I am happy you got resolution.  It's sad, but at least Jaime understands her insecurities and understands that he is making a decision. Having a spouse that separates you from your friends is a problem.  Ironically my Wife had no problem attending a wedding a few years after we met where my ex was in attendance but refused to spend time with another friend and his Wife, who was younger and frankly, better looking.  The latter effectively cut me off from that friend for over a decade until, frankly, she probably began to care less about ME and it became less of a problem.", "This sucks for you, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry a friendship has been lost/damaged.", "They say honesty is the best policy.....they also say truth hurts! Don't ask don't tell is also ANOTHER saying so pick your poison wisely", "I don't mean this as a dig, but Kate needs some therapy. She has some self esteem issues to the point where it effects her close friendships. This is stuff she can work out because that's gotta feel like shit for her.", "Maybe Kate needs to talk to a professional about this. I had the same issue until I got same help.", "What people mostly forget is that, while you may talk to someone first because they are attractive, you do not stay with someone because of how they look.\n\nLong term relationships are hard and take time.The reason why Jamie stayed with Kate has nothing to do with how attractive she is or not,but more how/who she was as a person. It is sad that women end up thinking early on that their value is based on how they look and that apparence is why your partner stays with you.\n\nIf you ended up being a better match, I am pretty sure Jamie would not have ended up with Kate.\n\nIf Jamie is a good person, it should matter less to him who looks best at what time.\n\nI think that reminding Kate that looks does not change her quality as an human being or the value of her relationship is a first step.\n\nJamie hopefully can find the right words to apologize. Life is not black and white, but showing kindness and empathy is a good step.", ">Kate has hopefully learned the lesson that you shouldn't ask a question if you don't want to know the answer. I\n\nUnfortunately all it takes is knowing that the question exists, and it will devour you. With insecurities, they eat you alive if you can't get on top of them.", "Well, at least Kate's fashion advice wasn't as bad as Jamie's life advice.", "Jamie did nothing wrong. Kate asked a stupid ass question and she got the honest answer. Fuck around and you\u2019ll find out. Kate has massive insecurities with tying her self worth to competing with OP in a very unhealthy way and it\u2019s not on Jamie to unpack and fix that. If anything I feel bad for Jamie because the implication behind all this is that Kate only picked him because she felt superior to OP for once in this super sick and unhealthy way that her mind thinks. She\u2019s extremely toxic and is likely going to hurt Jamie a lot more in the future when she goes to therapy and realizes she didn\u2019t pick him for him but rather because he served a delusional affirmation of her major insecurity. I don\u2019t feel sorry for her in the least because all of her problems are her own fault and she\u2019s hurt others because of them. Zero sympathy for people like her.", "I really don't think he meant it like that. \n\nThe fact is, he didn't actually come over to talk to either of us. His boss was one of the guys he was out with that night, and his boss came over to hit on me, and brought Jamie as his wingman. Jamie never wanted to talk to me in the first place, but because his boss did, he got chatting to Kate.\n\nAnd I really believe he loves her. You can see that he loves her. They just fit. It's sad to think that could be ruined because of him seeing me from 10ft away several years ago (and also because of his friend's unbelievable stupidity).", "It\u2019s not something you should say AT ALL, whether your partner is there or not.", "He said he's postponing the proposal because neither Kate nor the relationship are in the right place for it atm. I understand it to be that the relationship doesn't feel as stable, and no matter how much you love someone you don't want a proposal with unsaid things hanging over you.\n\nI don't believe he ever thought of Kate as second fiddle. He saw me across a room and thought I was pretty, knowing nothing about me. That happens daily in the world. You don't talk to every person you find attractive. It wasn't like he tried it on with me and I said no so he settled for Kate. He didn't, and never would have, tried hitting on me. Apart from noting that I was \"out of his league\" I was totally irrelevant.\n\nBut yeah, the whole thing is disappointing.", "Jamie could\u2019ve saved that situation easily if he\u2019d had two brain cells to rub together.", "I agree with this!  And I\u2019m glad OP seems to be handling it gracefully since that means reconciliation with Kate will still be on the table if Kate ever desires it.", "Yeah i find it off that Jamie contacts her separately like that.", "I don't think he's doing that. I'm married, he for sure has no chance now and he 1000% wouldn't have had one then either. Not that I think he would have wanted it, despite sharing an interest in one sport Jamie and I are pretty different, we definitely have different views on relationships, gender roles, other important things. All of those important things him and Kate share.", "I was about to say that there was a post a bit back where a bride had asked their sister/stepsister to not be a bride\u2019s maid, because the sister was undeniably attractive, and the bride was threatened about being upstaged. It\u2019s the exact situation, except reversed here and that OP was deemed TA. \n\nI would also agree that this OP here has a better chance of moving on from this friendship. It was doomed from that moment on, despite none of it being OP\u2019s fault :/ It simply happens. You find better friends than that.", "That's not a \"truth\" you tell your partner who you claim to love and intend to marry. Jamie is an idiot.", "Yeah, it's working out real well for me lol. /s", "Come on. Jaimie was stupid for saying it the way he did. But him thinking OP was more attractive years ago so talking to Katie isn't him getting his head turned.", "It\u2019s utterly tragic that she \u201ctied a lot of her self worth into finally being picked over [OP.]\u201d I mean, she\u2019s planning to marry Jamie! Does she really think he\u2019s with her because he actually thinks she\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world? Does she live in fear he might meet a beautiful celebrity one day and just drop her like nothing? \n\nObviously attraction is important in a relationship, but there has to be SO MUCH more there for it to last. Basically no one ends up with the most physically attractive person they\u2019ve ever seen in their lives, and that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re settling. It just means there\u2019s more to beauty than looks.", "I don't believe that it would be ruined because of that one night many years ago, but because of his actions now. The way he said it, it seems like Kate still is the safe choice, someone he settled for even though he wanted you.

I'm honestly so sad for her, and hope she can find happiness without him.", "It\u2019s not just that night that ruined things.

She may not have revealed just how fearful she was of this exact scenario playing out. The current mess is the result of a convergence of factors that didn\u2019t all originate with Jamie.

But you don\u2019t maintain a personal relationship with those people daily around the world. The way you worded it, he told you that he still feels you\u2019re out of his league. So that tells you how he still sees it in his heart of hearts. That if he had his shot with you, hot girl who shares his love of sports, he\u2019d go for it. But he feels he isn\u2019t good enough for you. \nA lot of people on Reddit see any sort of insecurity as childish. And they think it\u2019s unreasonable and people should just deal with it.

Jamie did saw Kate as a second fiddle. That's plain awful.", "Yeah, like he couldve just said \"but i spoke to the hot one\", \"sure OP was hot/pretty but isnt my type\" or smth like that, and this problem wouldnt have ever happened. Technically its not even a lie since he speaked to both his gf and OP (like theres no way you gonna flirt with one friend and not talk at least a little with the other), which he admitted was the hottest one so... \n\nJamie should learn to control his mouth when theres alcohol involved tho", "\"What are you talking about? I clearly asked out the hot one, she's sitting right there\" like come on Jamie this isn't too complicated", "He could still subconsciously be thinking that maybe your marriage isn\u2019t  happy, maybe you\u2019re open to the idea of something more. Maybe you\u2019d just give him the ego boost of saying \u201cof course I\u2019m not out of your league.\u201d\n\nHim using present tense feels really ick.

She obviously knows the OP is physically attractive. I think she was hoping that Jamie saw something in her that he thought was special or uniquely attractive - and he didn't. She was next to someone he thought was hot.", "This. So much. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone whose husband did (or says he did anyway haha) see them across the room and have a \"I have to meet her\" moment. I love that for him, but he's not the only man who's seen me across the room and wanted to talk to me, but I didn't end up with any of them because lasting relationships go so far beyond that. And in the years since, he's seen hotter women, it doesn't tarnish our relationship. \n\nLike, I just hate that looks are made to be so important when they literally indicate nothing.", "The right response from Jamie would have been - \"what do you mean?  I DID get with the hot one.\".", "I don't know how to explain it but I kind of feel that for me \"out of my league\" and \"not relationship material by my standards\" are surprisingly often overlapping. For example, Jason Momoa is truly hot and out of my league but at the same time, if somehow he would be interested in me (while being hit in the head with a heavy object and making real weird decisions?), I don't think I would see him as an actual potential life partner because our preferred lifestyles would be too different. The same with all the hot guys who hit the gym 6 days per week and mainly eat rice and chicken - really hot to look at, definitely out of my league and I definitely wouldn't be interested in it either, give me my daily pastry and let me sleep in. So I kind of understand where Jamie might have been coming from.", "Maybe I look at it the way I do because I liken it to the way I met my husband. I didn't walk into the room the night I met him and immediately notice that he was the most attractive person I've ever seen, but the moment we spoke we clicked, and it never entered my mind that it would matter that he wasn't the best looking in the room. I just don't consider seeing someone from 10ft away and thinking they're hot that much of a big deal because it doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBut then, I think maybe I'm looking at it wrong because the physical aspect is more of a thing for men. I don't know. I'm still trying to work it out in my head I guess.", "As I said in the post, I won't be inviting him to things in future. Even if Kate and I can't be friends like we used to be, I still feel out of respect for her I'm not going to invite Jamie places because I know it's making her feel bad. And I'm sure she will tell him this as well.", "I mean that\u2019s assuming his girlfriend wouldn\u2019t have run off with that tangent no matter what he said. She was already blaming/ taking it out on OP unreasonably. Who\u2019s to say the question wasn\u2019t enough to trigger her. Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re gonna say, a person is going to believe what they want. As she was already doing with OP.", "Well, I failed that test then, absolutely didn't refute that statement. I don't really go in terms of \"leagues\" but Jamie would never be on my radar romantically for reasons that have nothing to do with this looks.", "Honestly some of the worst types on this sub.", "That is why the more appropriate phrasing in those scenarios would be \u201cnot your type.\u201d By your own admission, these guys are not people you\u2019d be romantically interested in, even if they were interested in you. Their \u201cleague\u201d is irrelevant if you never cared about attracting them in the first place.", "I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t look at it the same way because your husband didn\u2019t have a friend in the room with him that night whom you would describe as \u201cout of your league,\u201d for physical or non-physical reasons.", "But imagine if the night you met your husband, your husband's best friend was also standing next to him. And it was your husband's best friend who caught your eye and made you go, WOW. And not just you but all the women in the room. So y'all went over to talk the friend but you lost your nerve because he was that attractive and ended up in conversation with your husband, who you clicked with. And in dating your husband you found out that every woman used him as a stepping stone to chat to the best friend, and your husband had insecurity about it.  And all your gfs wouldn't stop mentioning how you \"settled\" for your husband. \n\nYou seem like an emotionally mature person. So I'd imagined in that situation you'd probably shut your friends down. But you definitely wouldn't drunkenly tell your husband, \"the night we met I saw your best friend and thought *he's out of my league* and that led me to you \ud83d\ude0d\" and than be surprised when that makes your husband completely spiral and feel like \ud83d\udca9", "That's fair."]}
