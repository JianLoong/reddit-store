Most responses were not what I was expecting and really gave me a lot to think about.\n\nAs surprised as I was that so many people said to tell Jamie, I did realise it was the right thing to do. So, I texted him and told him that Kate was insisting I dressed a certain way. Jamie called and explained. A couple of months ago, Jamie and Kate were out with a few of his friends (these same friends that I mentioned in my comments are not fond of Kate), and everyone had had a lot to drink. They were talking about how they met their SOs, and the story of Jamie and Kate meeting came up. Apparently during the telling of the story Kate asked Jamie why he had decided to hit on her rather than me, and one of his friends joked that it was because he knew he didn't have a shot with \"the hot one\" - me. Kate asked if this was true, and Jamie having had WAY too much to drink, explained in a way that made it sound kind of true.\n\nHe said he did notice me that night and thought I was attractive, just seeing me. He said he would never have approached me because he knew he would never have a chance with someone like me, so in that way, his friend was right. He said that speaking to Kate was the absolute best outcome because he loves her and plans on spending the rest of his life with her, but even knowing this, Kate has taken this extremely hard, and even though she says she is over it, he's noticed changes in her behaviour that seem to be related to that. He also admitted that he'd been planning to propose to Kate at the party and that is why he'd wanted me to be there, but after hearing this on top of the way she has been handling the situation previously, he won't be doing that anymore.\n\nAfter speaking to Jamie, I called Kate. She admitted that she had tied a lot of her self worth in the fact that she'd finally been picked over me and now it felt like that wasn't true. She apologised for trying to solve her insecurities through me, but also said she wasn't sure she would be able to have me in her life as much as I had been with the way she's been feeling. As hurt as I was, I said I understood. She said she still wanted me to come to the party, since I'd helped organise it and she obviously dropped the absurd dress code, so I will be going to the party. I trust that Kate will communicate her boundaries to Jamie but I don't plan on inviting him to any more events for the foreseeable future.\n\nI'm really sad that I've probably lost a longtime friend over the drunken awkwardness of other people, but I also get that Kate can't help how she feels, and frankly it's for the best not to be in a secret competition. So, yeah, I'm hurt, but I'm going to the party. Not a satisfying update, but an honest one.\n\nUPDATE: going through these comments has actually brought up a couple of memories that have, in hindsight, made me a bit uncomfortable, and I actually don\u2019t think I will end up going to this party. As much as the mutual friends will have questions and I don\u2019t know how much of the truth I will end up telling, I feel too weird right now to continue to be involved in this situation.", "created_utc": 1679398517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xe70g/update_my_friend_asked_me_to_dress_badly_to_her/", "score": 9935, "replies": ["[removed]", "[removed]", "wow i really feel for you and kate and can say that jamie is definitely not worth breaking up your friendship. i hope she realizes that", "Jamie sounds like a real piece of work with bad taste in friends, so you dodged a bullet there. That's not something you should say in front of your partner. I hope Kate gets out of this relationship before it gets any more serious and you two can mend fences, but either way be glad he didn't think he had a shot with you and that you can just walk away from this while drama filled mess.", "This is heartbreaking for Kate. You did nothing wrong, and she obviously was out of line with what she asked of you, but I can\u2019t imagine hearing your partner say that would be an easy thing to get over, especially if she\u2019s insecure. She shouldn\u2019t have asked, he shouldn\u2019t have said what he did or exposed her to his friends if they have a history of not treating her well.

Is Jamie not ENRAGED at the person who said this?\n\n>She admitted that she had tied a lot of her self worth in the fact that she'd finally been picked over me and now it felt like that wasn't true. \n\nThat's sad.", "It would be devastating to hear that your SO was so into your friend but thought she\u2019d be out of his league so talked to you instead. And it wasn\u2019t a \u201cyeah you\u2019re hot but I was also very attracted to Kate.\u201d It was a \u201cI know that you ARE (in present tense) out of my league so yeah that\u2019s why I am with your friend\u201d And to know they share a special bond over a shared hobby and do that together sometimes. And the fact that the SO can still admit that he felt friend was out of his league. If I were Kate I couldn\u2019t help but question if my partner still has a desire/attraction to friend, especially with how he worded things. But this isn\u2019t friends fault. This could be a wake up call that Jamie isn\u2019t the right person for Kate. It\u2019s human to feel insecure about something like this. It\u2019s something that I personally wouldn\u2019t want to live with. Maybe it would be seen as conservative but I personally wouldn\u2019t maintain a personal friend relationship with my friends boyfriend if this revelation came out. And if I were Kate I would probably not want to stay in a situation that made me feel insecure, unsure, and second best.", "Something I'm not getting here, why is he postponing the proposal? Is he doing it to give time to Kate to heal or because he'll reevaluate the relationship? For me it doesn't make much sense to pause his plans, not when Kate is like this, or maybe I'm dense, but... he loves her so much, right? What's the problem?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is so sad. On your first post, I was against Kate, but now that I learned all this new info I think Jamie is the absolute asshole of this story. He's exposing Kate to people who don't like her and now it has truly affected her self-worth. On top of that, he did practically confess to going after Kate as a second fiddle???? I would be destroyed if my partner said that to me, it doesn't matter if the outcome turned out to be \"the best\". I would need to reevaluate the relationship tbh. I truly wish for Kate to dump his ass and dish his friends.\n\nAnd, of course, she shouldn't have done what she did to you. You're completely innocent in this. It does sound like a good idea, for the moment, for her to step back from your friendship with her. Maybe that way she can start to think clearly and will try to mend things later on.\n\nI wish you both the best. And for Jamie to be dumped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: grammar", "I would just let it set a while, Kate seems to have some issues to work through and maybe that will be easier with you not there.\n\nIf it were me, and this is just my personal opinion, I'd tell her that she can take as much time as she needs and I'd be there if she needed me. \n\nShe may come back, she may not, but it may help lift some of the weight.", "Damn. Way to go, Jamie. Hope you lose half of ever sock pair and your beers are always lukewarm.", "If Jamie loves Kate he will be telling his \"friends\" who said that to her where to get off. \n\nNTA", "My sympathies are with Kate but it is doubtful that she can continue her relationship with Jamie.  It kind of reminds me of the play \"Reasons to Be Pretty,\" by Neil LaBute.  Bottom line is that once a woman thinks that her SO does not find her attractive, there is kind of no going back.  I hope Kate finds someone to talk through her problems with and I hope she leaves Jamie because on some level, she is never going to trust him.", "This is unfortunate for everyone involved, but I hope that in time your friendship with Kate will either mend or evolve into a deeper and more honest one, now that all cards are on the table. \n\nI wanted to add that this was so nicely written! A really competently structured and clear narrative - a pleasure to read!", "Ugh. \n\nHonestly, fight for your friend\n\nDeep down she knows it's not about you and Jamie is still with her bc she's her\n\nDon't let yourself become the proxy for her insecurities. She may not be there now, but the more you fight to be her friend, the more she'll see that you are a whole person - and so is she.", "You know, I read your original post and the update and you of course were right in the refusal to attend because of not wanting your outfit policed. I\u2019ve been asked to \u201ctone it down\u201d before myself and was equally outraged.\nWhile reading your original post I did have the brief thought of well clearly OPs friend feels insecure and OP could just see this as what it is, a friend saying \u201cyou\u2019re prettier than me and I just want to be the pretty one for once tonight\u201d.\nI\u2019ve been on both sides at different points in my life.\nYou aren\u2019t wrong or an AH but I guess there\u2019s always a choice that might not be the \u201cright\u201d one but it\u2019s the empathetic one. But that\u2019s a decision I would make now that I\u2019m 40, not necessarily when I was younger. \nI\u2019m the frumpy wife now and I do feel sometimes less than excited about meeting up with my husbands friends with their smoking hot younger girlfriends who are dressed fashionably.", "Having been Kate, the friend that guys would only talk to in order to talk to my pretty best friend or as a consolation prize, as sad as it is for you, distance is the only way she's going to be able to boost her self-esteem and start to acknowledge that she's stunning in her own light.\n\nSadly I'm not sure there's a future in her relationship with Jamie. His friends don't like her. His friends see her as second best to you and openly comment on this. Jamie admitted he only started talking to her as a consolation prize because he didn't feel like he'd have a shot with you. You two have things in common she doesn't share with him and after she told him you couldn't make it he called you up to make sure you could make it. None of these things are your fault to be clear. It's not your fault straight men are cruel & will openly be harsh to women they don't find attractive or see as less attractive than the one they like. But if Kate decides she'd prefer to wait for the man who came across the room to talk to her because she caught his eye, for a man who doesn't let his friends make her feel second best, for a man who doesn't share things with her prettier best friend, than that would be fair.\n\nI wish you all well going forwards. I have to say though, Jamie doesn't sound great in all this. And it doesn't sound convincing that he's not interested in you at all.", "So Jamie was going to propose to her, but now he's planning not to because he doesn't like how she's acted after HE wrecked her self esteem. What an asshole. Poor Kate", "Sad update. I do hope she gets some therapy because those feelings of inadequacy and distrust aren't going to disappear just because you're no longer there--she'll transfer them to new people. She really needs to address her issue now if she wants to eventually be able to have a happy life with him.\n\nAnd he needs to address his own issues. What a thing to say to someone you're supposed to love!", "As someone who was always looked over for their hot friend, I really feel bad for Kate. That kind of insecurity really fucks with your head.\n\nI hope she leaves Jamie and finds someone who won\u2019t hesitate to pick her first", "I think even aside from what was said that night, the fact that Katie had a confidence boost of someone \u201cpicking\u201d her over you is not healthy (her interpretation of events).\n\nThe way this all came out in the open was unfortunate, but I think that deep insecurity is unhealthy and would have reared its head at some point. I hope she knows that distancing herself from you is not going to solve all her problems. Unless she avoids hot people forever, she\u2019s going to have to work through her feelings of inadequacy.", "Why even go this party? You\u2019re literally going to spend the whole time in this sort of  mind fog of \u201cokay this is the last time I\u2019m allowed to be around these people\u201d or \u201cafter today these people will no longer be my friends or in my life\u201d \nWhy waste you time or possibly make more drama cuz you know those friends who said that will most likely be there", "Am I the only one who thinks Jamie was feeling out his chances with OP when he called her? \u201cI knew I would never have a chance with you, so I talked to her \u2026\u201d and he was going to propose but now isn\u2019t.  Feels like he was leaving that open in case OP would say he was wrong in thinking he had no chance.\n\nUltimately a sad update, I feel for both you and Kate.  I hope she moves on from the relationship and finds someone who treats her with the love and respect she deserves.\n\nI will say that I wouldn\u2019t be too thrilled about my friends forming separate close (hang out alone) relationships with my SO.", "Fuck, I feel for Kate. It's got to feel bad enough already to have a BFF who is universally viewed as \"The hot one\", but finding out that her boyfriend only ever talked to her in the first place because he knew he didn't stand a chance with the hot one? Ouch. Come on jamie, some secrets you take to your grave.", "Many people here are giving Kate a pass and blaming only Jamie. The thing is, she always h\u00e1s been in a competition with you OP. She literally said she tried her self worth because she was picked over you once in her life. This didn't started It with Jamie.That's really sad and toxic for a friendship. And maybe the fact Jamie \"picked\" her played a big part in their relationship. Yes, I think it's best for both of you have a break of each other but I really hope Kate work on her self-esteem issues.", "They both suck, and you're better off without the petty jealousy and drama.", "On the other hand, Jamie told you the truth and didn't try to make himself look good.", "Congratulations on being the hot one OP", "People are so terribly insecure.", "You dodged a bullet because when someone else turns his head that Kate is going to have problems.", "0 re", "I am happy you got resolution.  It's sad, but at least Jaime understands her insecurities and understands that he is making a decision. Having a spouse that separates you from your friends is a problem.  Ironically my Wife had no problem attending a wedding a few years after we met where my ex was in attendance but refused to spend time with another friend and his Wife, who was younger and frankly, better looking.  The latter effectively cut me off from that friend for over a decade until, frankly, she probably began to care less about ME and it became less of a problem.", "This sucks for you, I'm sorry. You did nothing wrong. Being attractive has advantages, but also clear disadvantages. I'm sorry a friendship has been lost/damaged.", "They say honesty is the best policy.....they also say truth hurts! Don't ask don't tell is also ANOTHER saying so pick your poison wisely", "I don't mean this as a dig, but Kate needs some therapy. She has some self esteem issues to the point where it effects her close friendships. This is stuff she can work out because that's gotta feel like shit for her.", "Maybe Kate needs to talk to a professional about this. I had the same issue until I got same help.", "What people mostly forget is that, while you may talk to someone first because they are attractive, you do not stay with someone because of how they look.\n\nLong term relationships are hard and take time.The reason why Jamie stayed with Kate has nothing to do with how attractive she is or not,but more how/who she was as a person. It is sad that women end up thinking early on that their value is based on how they look and that apparence is why your partner stays with you.\n\nIf you ended up being a better match, I am pretty sure Jamie would not have ended up with Kate.\n\nIf Jamie is a good person, it should matter less to him who looks best at what time.\n\nI think that reminding Kate that looks does not change her quality as an human being or the value of her relationship is a first step.\n\nJamie hopefully can find the right words to apologize. Life is not black and white, but showing kindness and empathy is a good step.", ">Kate has hopefully learned the lesson that you shouldn't ask a question if you don't want to know the answer. I\n\nUnfortunately all it takes is knowing that the question exists, and it will devour you. With insecurities, they eat you alive if you can't get on top of them.", "Well, at least Kate's fashion advice wasn't as bad as Jamie's life advice.", "Jamie did nothing wrong. Kate asked a stupid ass question and she got the honest answer. Fuck around and you\u2019ll find out. Kate has massive insecurities with tying her self worth to competing with OP in a very unhealthy way and it\u2019s not on Jamie to unpack and fix that. If anything I feel bad for Jamie because the implication behind all this is that Kate only picked him because she felt superior to OP for once in this super sick and unhealthy way that her mind thinks. She\u2019s extremely toxic and is likely going to hurt Jamie a lot more in the future when she goes to therapy and realizes she didn\u2019t pick him for him but rather because he served a delusional affirmation of her major insecurity. I don\u2019t feel sorry for her in the least because all of her problems are her own fault and she\u2019s hurt others because of them. Zero sympathy for people like her.", "I really don't think he meant it like that. \n\nThe fact is, he didn't actually come over to talk to either of us. His boss was one of the guys he was out with that night, and his boss came over to hit on me, and brought Jamie as his wingman. Jamie never wanted to talk to me in the first place, but because his boss did, he got chatting to Kate.\n\nAnd I really believe he loves her. You can see that he loves her. They just fit. It's sad to think that could be ruined because of him seeing me from 10ft away several years ago (and also because of his friend's unbelievable stupidity).", "It\u2019s not something you should say AT ALL, whether your partner is there or not.", "He said he's postponing the proposal because neither Kate nor the relationship are in the right place for it atm. I understand it to be that the relationship doesn't feel as stable, and no matter how much you love someone you don't want a proposal with unsaid things hanging over you.\n\nI don't believe he ever thought of Kate as second fiddle. He saw me across a room and thought I was pretty, knowing nothing about me. That happens daily in the world. You don't talk to every person you find attractive. It wasn't like he tried it on with me and I said no so he settled for Kate. He didn't, and never would have, tried hitting on me. Apart from noting that I was \"out of his league\" I was totally irrelevant.\n\nBut yeah, the whole thing is disappointing.", "Jamie could\u2019ve saved that situation easily if he\u2019d had two brain cells to rub together.", "I agree with this!  And I\u2019m glad OP seems to be handling it gracefully since that means reconciliation with Kate will still be on the table if Kate ever desires it.", "Yeah i find it off that Jamie contacts her separately like that.", "I don't think he's doing that. I'm married, he for sure has no chance now and he 1000% wouldn't have had one then either. Not that I think he would have wanted it, despite sharing an interest in one sport Jamie and I are pretty different, we definitely have different views on relationships, gender roles, other important things. All of those important things him and Kate share.", "I was about to say that there was a post a bit back where a bride had asked their sister/stepsister to not be a bride\u2019s maid, because the sister was undeniably attractive, and the bride was threatened about being upstaged. It\u2019s the exact situation, except reversed here and that OP was deemed TA. \n\nI would also agree that this OP here has a better chance of moving on from this friendship. It was doomed from that moment on, despite none of it being OP\u2019s fault :/ It simply happens. You find better friends than that.", "That's not a \"truth\" you tell your partner who you claim to love and intend to marry. Jamie is an idiot.", "Yeah, it's working out real well for me lol. /s", "Come on. Jaimie was stupid for saying it the way he did. But him thinking OP was more attractive years ago so talking to Katie isn't him getting his head turned.", "It\u2019s utterly tragic that she \u201ctied a lot of her self worth into finally being picked over [OP.]\u201d I mean, she\u2019s planning to marry Jamie! Does she really think he\u2019s with her because he actually thinks she\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world? Does she live in fear he might meet a beautiful celebrity one day and just drop her like nothing? \n\nObviously attraction is important in a relationship, but there has to be SO MUCH more there for it to last. Basically no one ends up with the most physically attractive person they\u2019ve ever seen in their lives, and that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re settling. It just means there\u2019s more to beauty than looks.", "I don't believe that it would be ruined because of that one night many years ago, but because of his actions now. The way he said it, it seems like Kate still is the safe choice, someone he settled for even though he wanted you. That must be absolutely heartbreaking for her, knowing that the person you love feels like this. I'm honestly so sad for her, and hope she can find happiness without him.", "It\u2019s not just that night that ruined things. In Jamie\u2019s very faint defense, he waded into deeper waters than he realized when he made the choice to admit he saw you as \u201cout of his league.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound like he was fully aware of Kate\u2019s history of feeling invisible when next to you, or of the pre-existing tension in your friendship. She may not have revealed just how fearful she was of this exact scenario playing out. The current mess is the result of a convergence of factors that didn\u2019t all originate with Jamie. He couldn\u2019t smell the gasoline when he decided to light up that cigarette.", ">It's sad to think that could be ruined because of him seeing me from 10ft away several years ago (and also because of his friend's unbelievable stupidity).\n\nNah, *Jaime's* stupidity. \n\nAll he had to say was that *he was lucky enough to meet the most beautiful woman in the world* and shut down his idiot bros' comments down.\n\nYour friend deserves a better partner.", "Okay so why didn\u2019t Jamie just say, to his ridiculous friend, \u201cNo, my boss went over to see OP, I got dragged along and met Kate and that was it, I was hooked.\u201d  It\u2019s the truth even a drunk should be able to speak.  \n\nI wonder how his friend got that idea into his head in the first place.

But you don\u2019t maintain a personal relationship with those people daily around the world. The way you worded it, he told you that he still feels you\u2019re out of his league. So that tells you how he still sees it in his heart of hearts. That if he had his shot with you, hot girl who shares his love of sports, he\u2019d go for it. But he feels he isn\u2019t good enough for you. \nA lot of people on Reddit see any sort of insecurity as childish. And they think it\u2019s unreasonable and people should just deal with it.

Jamie did saw Kate as a second fiddle. That's plain awful.", "Yeah, like he couldve just said \"but i spoke to the hot one\", \"sure OP was hot/pretty but isnt my type\" or smth like that, and this problem wouldnt have ever happened. Technically its not even a lie since he speaked to both his gf and OP (like theres no way you gonna flirt with one friend and not talk at least a little with the other), which he admitted was the hottest one so... \n\nJamie should learn to control his mouth when theres alcohol involved tho", "\"What are you talking about? I clearly asked out the hot one, she's sitting right there\" like come on Jamie this isn't too complicated", "He could still subconsciously be thinking that maybe your marriage isn\u2019t  happy, maybe you\u2019re open to the idea of something more.

She obviously knows the OP is physically attractive. I think she was hoping that Jamie saw something in her that he thought was special or uniquely attractive - and he didn't. She was next to someone he thought was hot.", "This. So much. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone whose husband did (or says he did anyway haha) see them across the room and have a \"I have to meet her\" moment. I love that for him, but he's not the only man who's seen me across the room and wanted to talk to me, but I didn't end up with any of them because lasting relationships go so far beyond that. And in the years since, he's seen hotter women, it doesn't tarnish our relationship. \n\nLike, I just hate that looks are made to be so important when they literally indicate nothing.", "The right response from Jamie would have been - \"what do you mean?  I DID get with the hot one.\".", "I don't know how to explain it but I kind of feel that for me \"out of my league\" and \"not relationship material by my standards\" are surprisingly often overlapping. For example, Jason Momoa is truly hot and out of my league but at the same time, if somehow he would be interested in me (while being hit in the head with a heavy object and making real weird decisions?), I don't think I would see him as an actual potential life partner because our preferred lifestyles would be too different. The same with all the hot guys who hit the gym 6 days per week and mainly eat rice and chicken - really hot to look at, definitely out of my league and I definitely wouldn't be interested in it either, give me my daily pastry and let me sleep in.

I didn't walk into the room the night I met him and immediately notice that he was the most attractive person I've ever seen, but the moment we spoke we clicked, and it never entered my mind that it would matter that he wasn't the best looking in the room. I just don't consider seeing someone from 10ft away and thinking they're hot that much of a big deal because it doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBut then, I think maybe I'm looking at it wrong because the physical aspect is more of a thing for men. I don't know. I'm still trying to work it out in my head I guess.", "As I said in the post, I won't be inviting him to things in future.

And it was your husband's best friend who caught your eye and made you go, WOW. And not just you but all the women in the room. So y'all went over to talk the friend but you lost your nerve because he was that attractive and ended up in conversation with your husband, who you clicked with. And in dating your husband you found out that every woman used him as a stepping stone to chat to the best friend, and your husband had insecurity about it.  And all your gfs wouldn't stop mentioning how you \"settled\" for your husband. \n\nYou seem like an emotionally mature person.

If I found out my friend had been humiliated and hurt like that at a bar in front of a bunch of their friends by their asshole of a boyfriend? I\u2019d be pissed.", "Wow, I feel so sorry for Kate. That must have been so traumatic to hear, that her relationship began as him entertaining \"the less attractive one.\"\n\nThank you for posting an update, this one was weighing heavy on me, that the vast majority of commenters just could not even try to have empathy for Kate, who it seemed clear to me was dealing with a lot of insecurity in the sanctity of her relationship.\n\nI dealt with a situation where my partner was getting too close for comfort with one of my good friends, and was acting differently than with other female friends. I never put that burden of info on her, because I felt like it wasn't fair to do so, nor was it her fault, but I did ask them both to respect certain boundaries of not texting/communicating 1 on 1, and to not make plans without me, but ultimately I did have to lose that friendship. So your story hit close to home for me.\n\nHopefully she and Jamie can work on strengthening their relationship and trust enough for Kate to feel comfortable with you in her life again, but as I think you know, your separate friendship with Jamie needs to be left behind to have any chance of that. \n\nLastly, I'm sorry for you too. It's not your fault that he made that cruel comment right in front of Kate.

These friends and himself (no matter how much alcohol was involved) said things that would hurt her or any human being.  Also, it was not drunken awkwardness, it was a mean-spirited dressing down. \n\nI think you are minimising her valid feelings, which she managed fine with before it was rammed in her face. I can see a clear thought path to this pain as can many on this thread. She is the one experiencing pain, you are not.\n\nI wouldn't be going as I wouldn't wanna spend time with bullies. And I certainly wouldn't be wearing a dress to highlight their point and make my friend feel worse. \n\nI hate bullies but showing up for someone isn't just shouting someone down, it is about putting their needs before yours sometimes.\n\nIt is your choice, but remember beauty fades a good heart doesn't.", "This story is really sad and Jamie sounds like a complete asshole.

One thing I love about being closer to 40 than 30 now is that, yeah, I do feel some small (very small) twinge of jealousy when I notice a woman I find so much more attractive/fit/smarter/more accomplished than me. But now I'm in a place where I can quickly turn my thinking around and say, I'm me, not her so there is no comparison here. \n\nIf I want to improve myself, I can work on myself, looking at other women and being jealous of what they have/what they've worked hard to accomplish does me a disservice. They are living their lives and I am living mine. If I'm unhappy with what I've got, I gotta focus on me, not other girls and what they've got. \n\nI also make it a point to try and think something positive when I see someone and if I do have something nice to say, I try to tell them out loud (if possible) just to spread positivity (like \"I love your shoes!\" or \"that jacket is stunning\"). It's just so much more satisfying to get a compliment from a woman rather than a man (with the male gaze thing, it doesn't feel as genuine).

That being said, her deciding to take time and space away from your friendship (although the decision being made too late) is probably the best and most mature for everyone involved. \nShe recognizes that she cannot be in your life as often as she used to for her own mental health, and it sounds like you understand that.

We'd been friends since childhood, and it came out that a boy she liked in junior high had liked me first, which still upset her even though they dated for years. All these other instances of her feeling jealous or resenting me came out, and it strained our friendship. We both had to take a step back. Eventually we hung out again, but to be honest, our friendship was never the same. I felt like I had to be a more muted version of myself, and she started getting crushes on guys in my orbit (guys in my classes, or that I'd known first) and accuse me of flirting...It became exhausting, and unhealthy for both of us.\n\nThe funny thing is, my mom always told me she was jealous and to be careful, but I didn't listen. We're about the same level of attractiveness and she always dated more than me.\n\nOP, I hope that you and Katie can salvage your friendship, but you may not. You're doing the right thing by giving her space, but make sure you use this time to reevaluate your friendship from your standpoint.

Once when my boyfriend was drunk he said she was my hottest friend and it really got to me. He later clarified that he meant besides me but it still got in my head.

And apparently for good reason", "I disagree with a lot of what you said but the statement i do agree with: \n\nwhen she goes to therapy and realizes she didn\u2019t pick him for him but rather because he served a delusion in her head\n\nShe will be much better off, tackling this and no doubt these issue after this with be worse. She need to meet someone when she loves herself.", "Exactly! Kate asked the question she thought she knew the answer to and found out she was wrong! Yes that's upsetting, but now it's making me wonder if she's in this relationship because it helps her to feel superior to her friend?", "Sorry op but I gotta be honest, if he thought himself better looking, do you think he would have gone for you or kate? Imo its easy to answer from what he said, he would have gone for you if he thought he could. But he couldnt so he settled for Kate, thats what he made it sound like anyway. \n\nPostponing the proposal us such a weird play, i think hes doing it because he has a feeling she will say no infront of everyone, not for her to heal or anything.\n\nSeems like hes the A that has made her insecurities a 1000 times worse", "I feel like you're not as disappointed as you're typing here if in any way this story is real. Everything you say boils down to the fact that you're attractive, the entire tone of your post has no sympathy towards Kate (who supposedly is your long time friend). I'm saying this because either you're dumb (which I'm sure you're not) to see your relevancy to this chain of events or you're riding the fact that Jamie and his friends think you're attractive period. Sure no one is going to \"hit on you because they don't have a chance with you\" but they'd rub it on their partners, you seemingly have no qualms about it. \n\n\nJaime could have spoken to you that night if he thought he had a chance with you and who knows you two could have hit it off. Stop with the \"we don't talk to every attractive person we see\" bs. \n\n\nHave patience and sympathy for your friend and stay out of their relationship because why would you go this party it's only adding more oil to the fire. Hope Kate ditches both you and Jamie.", "This is so sad. If Jamie is choosing to not propose over this I\u2019m not sure he was actually ready to propose at all. You should not have your mind changed so rapidly over something rather minor in the grand scheme of things. Kate has every right to be insecure about this and he should be doing everything he can to make it up to her, not telling her way-hotter-friend-that-he-originally-liked that he\u2019s not going to do it anymore.", "He\u2019s postponing it because of how she treated one of her best friends who did nothing wrong. She let her insecurities get the best of her.

He\u2019s 100% still more into OP and it\u2019s really sad. His behaviour tells me he doesn\u2019t really care about Kate all that much.", "This so much!!!! And OP is still toying with the whole thing as well. If this story is true (and I have had my doubts all along) OP is not the innocent super hero she paints herself but also an AH because there is strong condescending eye rolling \u201clook at me I am so much better than all you serfs\u201d energy here.

It's when you add his gfs insecurity, that as her bf I find hard to believe he wasn't aware of, and his friends opinions that he never shut down, and that he was initially interested in OP. It's all that context that makes Jamie's behaviour weird.

But I'm glad I worked on that soon and didn't blame my friends for It.", "Oh yeah Jamie made it so much worse! It sounds like when it started the friends were just ribbing Jamie about it. These guys weren't even considering Kate! They were thinking it's funny that their friend didn't have a chance with OP... Like drunk guys do. Like you said Jamie went into it in more detail and that's when the problem started... But if Kate hadn't been using this relationship to feel superior to OP it wouldn't have mattered anyway! \n\nKate absolutely does measure herself against OP though, she would not accept the offer when OP said I just won't come to the party...She wanted OP there but she wanted her dressed down with no makeup on so she could feel superior to OP. Kate wanted to outshine her at the party and thought the only way to do that was to make OP look frumpy. It's probably really good that this came out now... Because she would have accepted this proposal, and its sounding like this wasn't a completely healthy relationship with the way Jamie is reacting to finding all this out.", "Nah he used present tense, he\u2019s still thinking about it", "That's a smart idea. I'm not sure he's the right choice for her. If she does decide she wants to marry him, even if you might not be in her life after today, at least try to be waiting in the wings if shit hits the fan and she regrets what she did.", "Does she? Her response to her partner saying something incredibly shitty was to punish OP for it, instead of him. And she didn't just let OP step aside for her. She demanded OP had to submit herself for punishment. Kate is vindictive and mean and knowingly taking it out on the wrong person.", "I don't enjoy being \"the hot one\", but after years of struggling with it in my teens to the point where I found it impossible to speak to boys/men because I would always have \"they wouldn't be talking to you if you didn't look like this\" playing in my head, I've accepted I can't do anything about it. I can only live the life I want and accept that a good chunk of it has become of something I have very little control over.\n\nBut yes, I agree that being considered attractive has probably shaped my perception of a lot of things, and perhaps desensitised me to how important it can be for some people that other people consider them physically attractive.", "You\u2019re 1000% right that it wasn\u2019t just that night that ruined things. But I also think the thing that would\u2019ve ruined everything regardless is that he has and continues to let his friends abuse the woman he supposedly loves more than anything. If someone started shit-talking my SO like that, I\u2019d tell them to back off or we aren\u2019t friends anymore; if they did it in FRONT of my SO, I don\u2019t know that they\u2019d even get that warning.

They\u2019re really good friends, to the point where he was begging OP to rearrange her schedule to be at the party. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s in love with her, at all, but from the perspective of Kate, I understand where the insecurities lie. You can\u2019t just write it off as physical attraction in the moment and nothing more, they have an emotional bond as well. Now, I know well enough that you can be friends with someone and not want to marry them, but putting yourself in Kate\u2019s shoes it can be hard to say that confidently. I feel for OP though, it sucks to lose friends for something you can\u2019t control.", "I'm admittedly a very insecure person and it would eat me alive if it was implied that my SO approached me instead of someone else because I was so much less beautiful.

Because once that thought was put there it'd be there always, especially if the other person was someone part of my life I'd always felt less desired than.", "i hope she doesnt marry this guy, he's a jerk", "Exactly! I wonder if a lot of her \"in love\" feelings come from a feeling of superiority/satisfaction by being picked over a friend that she thinks is more desirable? If that's the case then is she truly happy in this relationship or does it just stroke her ego?", "Well apparently Jamie is no longer planning to propose because Kate is showing reasonable negative emotions about what happened, so it sounds like Jamie isn\u2019t much of a catch anyway and she should absolutely NOT marry him", "I actually think your wrong. Most people I know find their partner really really atractive, and especially after knowing them can't imagine someone more beautifull. But even at first level attractiviness, there is not 'one perfect attractive person', just people who are really attractive to you, and it is definitly posible to end up with them.", "But do you honestly want to hear that the person you've been with originally picked you cause your friend was too hot and would likely turn them down?\n\nThat's not exactly a great thing to hear by someone who you want to spend your life with and it would take a toll on anyone's self esteem. Yeah it's great they ended up falling in love but to hear \"well I picked you cause I didn't think I had a chance with your friend\" can really fuck with someone. Especially if that someone is already insecure about themselves.\n\nI think it's best if OP and her friend distance themselves. Also Jamie is fucked up to say something like that. Whether she asked or not, he confirmed what she already thought and had experienced enough times already", "I dunno, I still think my husband is gorgeous, but others may not. I like that lumberjack beard look haha. \ud83e\udd23\n\nHe also takes care of me. He provides very well for our lifestyle and has strong ethics that align with mine. There absolutely is more to it besides physical attraction.", "This is also something you never ask your partner. Guess what, there\u2019s always going to be prettier, smarter, more talented, more charismatic people in the world than your partner. Trying to get your partner to lie about that reality is toxic and massively insecure.", "I still feel zero sympathy for her. Because of her delusions and insecurities, she\u2019s going to be hurting a lot of people. No respect for someone who manufactured all her problems herself.", "She should break up with him. No one should have to feel like a second choice to their partner.", "You're exactly right. He really could have phrased everything better to save all this drama, but he just had to say Kate was pretty much the \"safer\" choice. I completely understand why Kate was so upset by his words. It's enough to make you question the entire relationship.", "In an uncomfortable twist, I've worked out it's actually not because of his looks. It's because he's not richer.", "A lot of attractive people genuinely don't understand how differently they are treated. One of my attractive friends really had no idea that her male friends actually wanted to be with her because it just seemed like that's how guys act.\n\nFrom comments OP sounds like she is taking the distance from the bf, and respects the needs of her friend, while still struggling to come to terms with it all. It would be a bit creepy hearing you were being talked about that way, and Kate is understandably more affected by how she was treated than thinking about how gross these dudes were acting towards her friend.", "I already said what Jamie said was shitty, and what his friends said is shitty. I've met them multiple times, they're kind of shitty people in general, I'm just not surprised one of them pulled that kind of crap, frankly.\n\nAnd no, Jamie and I would not have hit it off. I was dating my now-husband at the time, and even if it I wasn't, never in a million years would I have hit it off with Jamie, I don't like him like that, we are very different people, we do not vibe on that level.\n\nI am absolutely sad for Kate that this is how things played out, and I'm sad that years of friendship has to go down the drain over Jamie because my God is he not worth it.\n\nBut, I have realised over the course of this whole incident that Jamie is not the beginning and end of the issues between me and Kate. Her self esteem being partially dependent on \"winning\" over me in a competition I didn't know we were in isn't the way you think about a friend, and it was *never* how I thought about her. And for her to try to embarrass me, or pull me up for some imagined slight based on something that never had anything to do with me in the first place isn't being a good friend either. And I would have worked on it, honestly I would have, because I love her, but she doesn't want to, which is fine, but I won't be pretending she was in the right for how she's handled this in regard to me because she isn't.", "Kate asked her best friend to not dress up to a party to not caught her man's attention.

It's better that they talk and solve the issue that arrised in their relationship before thinking on getting married.", ">She said she still wanted me to come to the party, **since I'd helped organise it** and she obviously dropped the absurd dress code, so I will be going to the party. I trust that Kate will communicate her boundaries to Jamie but **I don't plan on inviting him to any more events for the foreseeable future.**\n\nI don't think OP is being unreasonable going to a party she helped plan, and she's setting very firm boundaries with Jamie. May I ask how you think she's being condescending? I don't see her putting down Kate in any way but sympathizing and being understanding of her without looking down upon her. She even says she's sorry to lose her friend, but that she'd rather not be in secret competition.", "> \u201cBut I spoke to the hot one\u201d\n\nBOOM. Mic drop.

What a fool.", "I'm to defending Jamie. He did a shitty thing. What I've been trying to say is that I don't think what he said is because he has the misguided fantasy of getting with me. That's not a defence of what he said. He said a dick-ish thing, his friends I can say with absolute certainty are dicks, I've met them, they're just walking icks.\n\nI'm not sure what else I was meant to say. \"You're an AH\", we know that. \"Your friends are AHs\" we know that also. \"You shouldn't have said that\" covered.

Unfortunately given my experience as more of a wallflower and rarely \u201cthe hot one\u201d, I have a lot of trouble seeing the struggle in school. Not to down play it! I completely believe it comes with hardship as much as anything else, especially if any guys were more forward or forceful with their approach.\n\nSadly I do not think this scenario is one that a single person will ever be able to fully understand when they sit in a completely different side than the other person. Like you and your friend. Definitely take things slow and if she comes back for your friendship, be patient and honest. I\u2019m sure she has a lot of demons to work through.", "It's a very different experience that can be hard for either side to really understand.   It took me a long time to understand the downsides of being attractive. It's really hard to feel invisible all the time, and you don't realise that the \"compliments\" are often gross and relentless and can be scary. That comes with age and experience and working through your stuff.  \n\nIf a partner really sees you, you don't feel the way Kate feels with Jamie, because they light up with you in a particular way that is just for you.", "If you didn't enjoy being the hot one, why not dress down like your friend asked you to?", "Ugh what a heartbreaking way to put it.

If some random person did this to me/you instead of a long time friend like Kate, then there's no point in debating ditch them all. \n\n\nBUT, most of my response is based on how I would handle this situation if it were my long time friend and her shitty fiance. Hell I'll even apologise because for staters it'll make Kate feel better, then when she works herself out she will realise how you were not in the wrong. I would tell my friend that I'll take a step back from her relationship and her so she has the time and space to heal and understand how to deal with her insecurities. \n\n\nAnd you and Jamie hitting it off was a hypothetical imagine, a scenario where someone starts talking because one thinks the other is attractive and then they hit it off.\n\n\nYou're in a healthy relationship and in a good place mentally so it's not a wrong thing to be supportive of Kate even though she didn't treat you right. That's what I would do. Although I don't know if I'll jump back in with Kate whenever she's ready in the future. Maybe a permanent step back could be a good thing for all of you without balming kate for how she handled her insecurity.\n\n\nETA: why even go this party? You can't possibly think all 3 you will have good time there along with Jamie's shitty friends?", "Kate is the reason your friendship with Kate is going down on a drain, and I'm glad you are seeing that.

Kate has a lot of work to do on herself.", "Okay, but my point still stands - clearly Jamie isn\u2019t mature enough for marriage either.", "If she has lost her friend then why go?", "I dont disagree that the friendship isnt healthy at all and Kate is definitely to blame for the secret competition thing. But OP has made a lot of comments about how *she* wouldn't have taken offense like Kate did and so Kate is over reacting and how \"Jamie didn't mean it *like that*\". It comes off as very Jamie apologist and trying to make Kate the villain in some way, so I have my doubts that OPs a very good friend herself and perhaps even played into the issue here.", "And it\u2019s things like that that are why Kate is struggling. Because Jamie is looking for openings and you aren\u2019t like SHES MY BEST FRIEND HOW DARE YOU", "Do Jamie and Kate both know that? He might, but he might not given the things he says and the time he spends with you without her around. Clearly Kate thinks Jamie might have a chance with you or thinks he does. Given her long history of being outshined in your presence, her insecurity her is completely understandable, especially in light of HIS behavior around you.\n\nSo, IMO, ESH. Kate, for not dealing with her insecurity in a mature manner and putting blame for her doubts on you. This sucks, but is both understandable and forgivable. Jamie, for not having her back when his friends insult her, for agreeing with his jerk friend about her second-class status compared to you, and for feeding her insecurity by spending so much time with you without her. And You, OP, for putting yourself and your pride ahead of her feelings because simply toning down your look for one night so your friend can make a strong impression on his family and so she can feel good about herself in your presence is just too much to ask, apparently.", "But at the end of the day, he picked the worst things to say. We have no idea how kate would have reacted to him saying literally anything decent, but something tells me it would have been a better outcome", "You\u2019re aware that this conversation was the reason she was treating OP differently right?", "Assumptions make an A of you and me as they say. You dont know for certain that she would have taken it badly, but he went with probably the worst possible option short of \"you looked easy\" which was inferred anyway. Ofcourse shes going to react badly to that, he could have said way better things and if she still blew up then it would be on her", "Before you dig yourself into too deep of a hole, she said she\u2019s struggled with this even as a teen, meaning the surgery isn\u2019t what made her \u201cthe hot one\u201d.

I go backwards and forwards some days on whether I like these facts or not.

I feel bad that a years long friendship has been ruined over something as petty as looks.", "Because why should she? It\u2019s a ridiculous request.", "He\u2019s even more of an idiot for having said anything along those lines to his friends, who don\u2019t like Kate. Did he really think they wouldn\u2019t use it against her?", "Correct, but as I said, look at things from *Kate\u2019s* perspective. How would she know that Jamie wanted OP there so he could propose? She couldn\u2019t. All she saw was Jamie begging for OP to attend his birthday party, and with all the other info she had, that\u2019s definitely going to breed insecurity in most people. Jealousy is a human emotion, and as much as it would be nice to tell her to get over it, I see why she felt the way she did.", "And now that Kate has had a (honestly reasonable, if the handling was poor) issue with OP, he\u2019s not proposing.

It is what it is", "They certainly won't get married when she finds out\n\n1. he was going to propose\n2. after he found out about GF's request, he decided not to\n3. OP knew about the decision not to propose first", "No, and Kate is going to blame OP when they break up, \"Nothing was the same after the situation with Jamie's birthday party.\"", "I mean I'm not super pretty and watch too many pretty people not have meaningful happy relationships because they're hot. There's a million other things to love in a person other than appearances.", "I wish I could believe that too! It's been 3 years and she still wants OP to dress down around her boyfriend so she appears hotter. Clearly she still believes that the boyfriend would find OP more attractive. Yes, Jamie screwed up by admitting it and saying what he said. But he must know something is off with the relationship too because he decided not to propose after the way she reacted. There's a lot we don't know about that relationship, I'm sure OP doesn't know it all either! Hopefully they are truly happy and this is just a little bump in the relationship. Guess we'll never know", "Especially when he still goes to events with the now-married \u201chot one\u201d. Jamie needed to have a much more selective memory about that first meeting.\n\nBut it seems like insecure Kate wanted to prove a point to Jamie\u2019s friends, by being the \u201chot one\u201d at that party.", "It makes me wonder how much of their friendship has consisted of OP shining while Kate was relegated to the shadows. Not saying it's OP's fault, or that she's going out of her way to make her friend feel small. Sometimes that just happens, and Kate's growing insecurity and need to outshine her has essentially ruined their friendship. It's really too bad, and Kate's going to need to do a lot of work to get her head on straight.", "That\u2019s cool to grow. But hurting others in the process is something I don\u2019t respect.", "One instance of someone letting their friends publicly humiliate me is enough for me. What they said was cruel and he did nothing besides passively agree with them.", "Well never, and if he did that would be a really shitty thing to say. Undoubtedly Jamie was AH to say that or let that conversation go on.\n\nI just wonder if I would let that negate the actual important things in my relationship, which is absolutely not how hot my husband thought I was in the first minute of seeing me. \n\nThat's all, it was just a thought. Not a definitive judgement on Kate's thought process, which she is totally entitled to.", "Her being married doesn't necessarily inform boyfriend's feelings about her though.  Like, it may not be about something happening, but about the way he looks at her.", "Yep. Been married for nearly two years. I was dating my now husband when we met Jamie.", "This is super weird, because I've literally only been putting the pieces together in the last few hours since this all happened. But yeah, looking back on it, Jamie has always teased me (in group situations, not over text or in any inappropriate way) about dating successful men (this is a running joke amongst my friends hence how he knows about it). He's also said a lot of things in the vein of \"if you're a guy it's not about looks, it's about money\". \n\nOMG. It's all coming back to me now. One time him and Kate were out with me and my husband and Kate and I were in the loo, and my husband and Jamie were talking about cars and he mentioned my new car and (jokingly) how he spoils me and Jamie said something like \"well yeah, girls like her, you have to, don't you\". And me and my husband laughed about it at the time because we thought it was him making a dig at me but looking back on it, now I'm like...\n\nUgh, this is getting gross.", "Yeah.", "OP said in another comment that she would exclude him from any future activities with Kate.", "I'm not in competition with anyone. And that's not because I'm the most attractive person on earth, in fact it has nothing to do with looks. I'm *happy*. I'm not looking around at what other people have or what I can take from them because I don't want it. And I don't tend to keep people in my life who want the things I have either. I never saw Kate as being like that, but this has made me rethink a lot.\n\nI'm just not a competitive person, I never have been.", "Kate and I have a lot of mutual friend who will be at this party, and who I figure Kate doesn't want to tell the truth of why I wouldn't be going.", "We have a lot of mutual friends who will be at the party. Honestly I think a lot of the reason Kate still wants me to come is because she will not want to explain to our mutual friends why I'm not there.", "That might be Kate's or Jamie's perception of reality, but it's factually incorrect. And if Jamie had ever let on that he had a fleeting thought that he might have had a chance with me I'd have absolutely lost it on him.", "I mean while what he said wasn\u2019t ideal, it for sure wasn\u2019t the worst. I agree with you we don\u2019t know how she would have acted, but her trying to make demands to OP and shifting the blame to her isn\u2019t exactly reasonable. So there\u2019s also a chance, no matter what he said, she wouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. Especially since she had already tied her self worth to \u201cfinally being chosen first\u201d.", "Right, so instead of talking to her boyfriend about it and how his friends were acting, she took it out on OP. So not really, she was treating OP differently because she couldn\u2019t face her own insecurities or communicate to her bf that she was hurt. She didn\u2019t communicate to OP either, just made unreasonable demands.", "I mean I agree with the assumption bit. I am sort of assuming the question set her off and his words pushed her and the people I\u2019m responding to are assuming he could have fixed the situation with magic words. We don\u2019t know for sure, but I agree his words didn\u2019t help. And I don\u2019t blame her for reacting badly to them, but I do blame her for shifting it and attacker her friend instead of having a conversation with him about it.", "A boob job and nose job likely did make her \u201chotter\u201d\n\nBut overall I\u2019m just sad for both Kate and OP (not Jamie, he sucks.)\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry OP feels her husband wouldn\u2019t be with her if she didn\u2019t look the way she did.\n\nEta: never mind on feeling sorry for OP that her husband wouldn\u2019t be with her if she wasn\u2019t hot.  Sounds like she wouldn\u2019t be with him if he wasn\u2019t rich? So I guess they both get what they want? A trophy wife for him and the ability to not work for her?", "Man I really don\u2019t understand why Kate is feeling even a little bit insecure. Plastic surgery is an option anyone could take if they care enough to spend the insane amounts of money and health risks of surgeries\u2026 she clearly doesn\u2019t, so why waste time feeling lesser than someone who chose to pay for it?\n\nShe needs to drop Jaime, he sounds fucking awful. I also wonder if you enjoy his \u201cfriendship\u201d because you like the attention he gives you\n\nThis whole thing makes me feel so sad for Kate", "This would definitely affect many relationships. Even if you are the closest couple to ever exist, a comment like that can drive the tiniest wedge in your heart.

This isn't about, \"one time this guy Jamnie didn't think I was the hottest girl in the room.\" I guarantee that this has been a recurring thing. You and Kate go out to places and you get way more attention. All the guys want to talk to you. It has probably eaten away at her self-esteem for a long time. But she can't bring that up to you because it's not your fault.\n\nOne time you go out together and then there's this amazing guy. And guess what: He picks Kate! Not OP, like most of the other guys do. He sees Kate differently than most.\n\nExcept you eventually find out that, no, he didn't \"pick\" her. He didn't approach her because she was the one that intrigued him or made him nervous or excited. He settled for her. She thought for just one night in her life SHE was the one a guy saw as \"The Catch\" of you two.\n\nYes, they've obviously built a great relationship since then, looks aren't everything, and he'd pick her over you 1 million times out of 1 million at this point.\n\nBut that's not getting at the root of it. You sound like a really amazing friend who handled this entire situation with dignity and compassion, but based on the dynamics here I'm not sure you understand what she must have been feeling like for all of these years. You do not know what it's like to be \"the ugly friend.\" And so if your current husband didn't happen to think you were the hottest person in the world at the first moment he met you, it's fine, because you're not used to ALWAYS being the consolation prize.", "No offense but you seem like you don\u2019t have a lot of empathy and enjoy being \u201cthe hot one\u201d more than you care about Kate\u2019s reasonable feelings and how awful her boyfriend is being in response to those feelings.", "It's best if you stop engaging lol the more you say things the more it shows how you're belittling Kate at the end because she refuses to accept and approve that the whole world thinks you're the most attractive.", "Your lack of empathy for Kate is astounding (and its diagusting how you keep trying to blame her somehow in this scenario), I hope for her sake you two don't become friends again.", "Ill be real op, i think hes jelous he cant have you. Thats what I see personally, not to put things in your head but. If you turned around and said I want to an affair with jamie, it sounds like hed do it. I dont trust him at all, seems to weird about you honestly. \n\nIm not saying he doesnt care for Kate, but definately seems like he wanted and still wants you and is jelous that your husband has you, so hes basically saying that all you care about is money not the man, or youd be with him.\n\nI may be over reaching abit, but thats what im seeing here anyway.", "I mean yeah this really confirms that he did, in fact, see Kate as a consolation prize. And *continues* to view her as second-best to this day. \n\nThe way she chose to make his shitty behavior your problem was undeserved, but damn, she is absolutely correct about her boyfriend\u2019s feelings. If he\u2019d felt like he could \u201cafford\u201d you, he absolutely would\u2019ve pursued you instead of her that night.", "following your recent understanding of his intentions, do you feel like his friendship with you has been misguided as he hopes to someday be with you? from reading all of this, it seems like hes with kate out of convenience. you dont treat the girl you plan to marry and claim to love like this.", "I meant OP is still going to this party that started everything which is Jamie's birthday party.", "You can't just say you have some unavoidable work? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "I mean you can be \u201csick\u201d, no?", "Why can\u2019t you just graciously not go? Why does any of this need explaining to anyone not involved? Why can\u2019t you just remove yourself gracefully and let them work it out? It sounds like you are determined to make this about you.", "Sounds like one of those situations where because you are happily married and secure in yourself, your life and your marriage, there's a chance you missed that Jamie was being dodgy because that's not how you think or act. We're strangers so we don't know better than you, you're in the situation and know these people. But the way Jaimie has been insisting on your presence at the party proposal or no proposal, the way he didn't cut off your hang outs when he learned about Kate's insecurity, the way he didn't shut down his friends treatment of Kate and the way he still sees you as 'out of his league' instead of as a friend ... to strangers it sounds like there's a possibility Kate's insecurity spiralled to where it did because deep down she's aware that if you were to express interest in Jamie, he would jump. And even if it's not true, Jamie's a dog for making the woman he planned to marry feel that way.", "Id say that him saying, essentially \"yeah you were my second choice, OP was out of my league\" is pretty much as  bad as it gets, especially for kate \n\nIts like saying.. \"i chose you because you arent as pretty as your sister\", yknow?", "I mean\u2026.. not really? Look at literally every female celebrity ever. They were hot before and they\u2019re hot now\u2026 honestly I\u2019d argue most looked better without the surgery. Its definitely not accurate to say \u2018hotter\u2019 more likely it\u2019s just \u2018different\u2019. It\u2019s all about self perception sometimes. \n\nAnd yeah, but also, if she looked how she did but was a horrid person, she wouldn\u2019t be with him either, so it isn\u2019t just looks. Attraction is important, but it\u2019s not everything. I\u2019m sure she knows that. It\u2019s different if she thought that\u2019s the only reason her husband is with her of course.", "Because a lot of people want to be wanted without having to pay insane amounts of money for surgeries, not to mention take the health risks of such surgeries. Insecurity isn't fixed by the surgery anyway because then it's, \"would they be with me if I didn't have the surgery?\" If the answer is no, then, \"do they really love *me* or just what I look like?\"", "Well I didn't know him for the decade I was friends with her before we met him so....", "I'm not OP, but I'd have empathy for Kate and her reasonable feelings up to the point she started her shitty, UNreasonable response to them. Jamie said something shitty, yes. Her feelings were hurt yes. I feel bad for her at that point, yes. But the way she processed and reacted to those feelings is where I lose my *sympathy* for her. She took her feelings out on OP, who was innocent in all this, and in a shitty, malicious way. OP tried to bow out gracefully and Kate demanded OP stay and let her *punish* OP for something she had nothing to do with. *I* am pissed at Kate for this, and I'm just reading about it secondhand. So I think OP is excused for not being empathetic toward Kate now.", "Kate is a horrible friend anyways to treat OP the way she did because of her insecurities. Lots of ppl see someone   Differently based on how the look but then they get to know them and feelings change.", "Oh right sorry.", "Would be suspicious considering I don't work lol. But also, they've been aware of this issue with the dress code, so they would think it was because of something related to that and I know they've all kind of started to turn on her about that also.", "I could. Tbh going through these comments a lot of things are coming back to me now that are seriously grossing me out and I don't think I will end up going to this party.", "Exactly. It sounds like OP likes being the centre of attention. Honestly, it sounds like kate and jamu are going to have a lot more trouble, and by going you are inserting yourself in the middle of it all...", "So that\u2019s why I agreed that it wasn\u2019t ideal, because he did admit he thought OP was pretty and though she was out of his league. But then he also said that talking to Kate was the best thing that happened to him and that he loved her. So yes, he was drunk and explained it badly. But he also said that he loved her and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. And then she took all that information and came up with \u201cI need to make sure OP looks ugly so a guy that loves me and plans on proposing to me won\u2019t get with her\u201d. It was always about her own insecurities.", "That\u2019s even weirder bro- I can\u2019t imagine asking out a friend\u2019s boyfriend (who I met THROUGH HER) to spend one on one time together\n\nI actually can\u2019t imagine a single one of my female friends ever doing that because not a single one ever would", "How do they know about the dress code thing? Did you tell them?", "wow. go to that party stir up some more drama (it's inevitable atp). Hoping that will be Kate's wake up call to realise her self worth and that she deserves better friends and boyfriend.", "Sorry,  but after the bomb he dropped, \"but i swear i love you\"! Isnt gonna cut it. \n\nKate reacted badly, but shes apologized to OP so i dont see anything wrong there. But theres no way that any normal person wouldnt be insecure after a revelation like that. It would take a *long* time to get over, if it was even possible.", "Sounds like Jamie spills everything. I\u2019m betting it\u2019s him.", "Then that\u2019s something she should have talked to her BF about. Not something she should attack OP over. And I never said she shouldn\u2019t be insecure over what her bf said. Any \u201cnormal person\u201d would talk to their SO about how their words hurt them. Not make demands and shift the blame to her friend. And also an apology of \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I did, but I have to cut you off\u201d is not really a normal apology. Kate inserted OP into drama between her and her bf, and then cut her off completely.", "I\u2019ll be honest, this update makes Jamie more of an asshole than Kate. Kate is an insecure mess, but it seems Jame is a big part of the reason why with his gross comments and weird attitude. At this point I feel more sorry for her than anything else. \n\nYou\u2019re still not the asshole, but I don\u2019t think Kate is either.", "I read the old thread, and some of the comments on this one, and I'm puzzled as to why you're still going to the party at all. He's not your friend, Kate is/was, he clearly wants you there (and likes being around you generally) because he fancies you, that was obvious in the last thread and even MORE obvious in this one, but you're not interested in him. So what's the point in going?\n\nYou'll just upset Kate even further, who will probably be devastated when she finds out he's no longer going to propose to her, and then even more devastated when she finds out you knew all about that before she did because he confided in you - I mean, come on. You can't be that oblivious to all of this and how it's going to pan out!", ">Apparently during the telling of the story Kate asked Jamie why he had decided to hit on her rather than me, and one of his friends joked that it was because he knew he didn't have a shot with \"the hot one\" - me.\n\n\n\nSo... you're losing a friend because Jamie's friend is an AH... In what world is that any way appropriate for him to say regardless of drinking?  Is Jamie still friends with that guy or did he get off scot-free after basically insulting Kate to her face? Jamie a dumbass too for insinuating in any way that there was any truth in that disgusting comment. I'd drop Jamie all together, only be there for Kate in the future", "After reading the update while I don't agree with it being right for Kate to try and police what you wear it does make more sense why she feels a bit insecure.   Jamie's friends who even brought up why he didn't approach you are AH's and Jamie should have shut them down right away instead of dignifying their question with an \"honest\" response. Outside of the the question being ignorant his response was really insensitive to the woman he supposedly loves and wants to spend his life with.  Most women would have been hurt by that response. However, none of that is OPs fault and I don't blame her for not being comfortable with going to Jamie's party.  It's a shame that it is now affecting OPs friendship with Kate though.", "Fuck i definitely feel for Kate though. I always thought me and my best friend were equally attractive in slightly different ways but it sure crushed my spirit in an unexpected way when several of my exs went after her when we broke up.", "I hope Kate ends the relationship. It\u2019s obvious her boyfriend kind of settled for her and she\u2019ll never get over that. She\u2019ll question her worth and her place in her life as long as they are together. What he said while he was drunk is how he felt- he only went for Kate because he didn\u2019t think he could get with you", "This is very very familiar to me. A long time ago I had a friend that everyone thought was beautiful. No one can imagine how detrimental that can be to your self esteem. I already had extremely low self esteem from being bullied in school so I never let it torpedo our friendship, but it did really hurt. Guys who made fun of me at work would turn on the charm when she would come visit me at work. I\u2019d start talking to a guy at a store, she would come over and he would forget about me completely. So I actually feel for Kate.", "[deleted]", "Poor Kate. It's really sad that you couldn't just take a back seat for once. Instead you're losing friends over it.", "I bet if this is revisited years down the line, Jamie will be back in OP's life without Kate.  Thing is you all DID have connections to things and had common interests.  The bigger thing is OP does have real feelings for him (they don't have to be sexual but they are genuine feelings.)  \n\nTaking time might be for the best, but remember \"love something and let it go if it comes back it was meant to be.", "Oh yeah - this \"post\" is fake. Someone is living her \"i always overshadow my friends\" fantasy.\n\nEdit : Since the post is deleted now, the reason i thought so was because OP never mentions anything about her husband at all. What does he think of all of this? Is he going to the party?

It sounds like she has very valid reasons to not trust Jamie\u2019s feelings towards OP, and it sounds like she expressed those reasons in a poor, indirect way (\u2018please don\u2019t look too good at the party\u2019). \n\nFrom this update and the original post, with albeit limited information on Kate, why *shouldn\u2019t* Jamie like OP more than Kate?", "Yikes. What a clusterfuck of a relationship. Kate really needs therapy to deal with the imaginary competition she feels she is in with you and possibly take some time away from her boyfriend, since he seems cool with his friends saying unbelievably rude things to his supposed future fianc\u00e9. Just. Yikes. None of this is your fault.", "Stay away from that toxic \"friend\". You don't need this!", "Sorry OP but I see no future for you with either of them. Kate is not going to suddenly find her self-esteem. She\u2019s always going to be looking at you with jealousy and measuring herself against you. Jamie is just as bad because CLEARLY he has shitty friends and doesn\u2019t care how they make his gf feel. He also comes off as deceptive\u2014how he talks about Kate to his friends is unclear but that he hasn\u2019t stopped them from doing so is VERY clear. \n\nI\u2019ve had friends who put me in the same position as you (without the frumpy wardrobe request) and honestly it\u2019s bad for everyone. It\u2019s not healthy. Just like Kate shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad about how she looks, you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad about how you look. And frankly the way people talk about you (and feel comfortable talking about you but not too you because you look a certain way) is not okay either and Jamie should have shut that down too and never said what he did. It\u2019s sucks to lose friends but it\u2019s worse trying to hold onto people who actively wish you ill so they can feel better about themselves in the competition they created between you in their minds.", "Everyone\u2019s giving Kate a lot of sympathy here that I don\u2019t think she deserves. There is ALWAYS going to be someone prettier than you. I have friends who are prettier/thinner/more stylish than myself, but I don\u2019t ask them to dress like they don\u2019t own a mirror when they come to family events.

It's no longer special because it's not an engagement thing, also Kate is saying she's taking her distance after that.

That's really, really shitty. And I think her and Jamie need a long long talk about him letting them disparage her as a \"joke.\" \n\nAlso, where did that joke come from? Probably Jamie telling them that story. He's been devaluing her from the start.

ETA: I would normally not defend someone else\u2019s insecurities but being that Kate literally has a somewhat of a little reason to be apprehensive around you- her boyfriend literally did say he only chose Kate bcuz he didn\u2019t think he could get you- can\u2019t you cut Kate some slack, again insecurities are ugly but I have never heard of anyone being insecure where they actually have some ground to stand on, Jamie\u2019s really the jerk not Kate- this only applies if your losing a longtime friend refers to Kate- if not- disregard.", "Replying to your \u2018not going to party\u2019 postscript, I think that\u2019s for the best.

Everyone has their 'celebrity crushes' which essentially are just physical attractions to people you would probably otherwise hate. \n\nThe sad reality is this boils down to the friends insecurities, and it is a shame that they will both lose a best friend over this.

But it wasn't. Kate demanded that OP still come and let Kate dress her in whatever degrading way she wanted. She didn't just want to avoid being outshone. She wanted to humble OP. She wanted to beat OP in a competition that was only in her head. If the goal was to simply avoid, then avoid.

I can actually understand now why OP might not be overly empathetic toward Kate. At first I couldn\u2019t, but think about it: It\u2019s a VERY hard pill to swallow that someone who you considered to be a good friend has feelings of resentment and jealousy toward you for things you have no control over. Not to mention that OP isn\u2019t even single. If she had been, God knows how Kate would have acted. It\u2019s absolutely possible to feel empathy toward people and NOT accommodate their actions with apologies they don\u2019t deserve, and if I were OP, I\u2019d be wondering if the relationship was really worth saving if someone had professed to basing a large portion on their self-esteem at one-upping me. That\u2019s not something I think I would get over easily, regardless of whether or not shitty BF Jamie was in the picture anymore. Who can say that the jealousy and resentment would stop if Jamie was no longer in the picture?", "Absolutely agree. I went back and read original and they met on the same night and then OP proceeds to text with Jamie without Kate involved and they go to sporting events without Kate. Thats not girl code. This isn\u2019t some long standing friendship and then he met the girlfriend later so they continue their normal friendship routine. OP *may* be married but in any event he asked out Kate so OP should have backed up and let her friend have the relationship. But no she tramples all over her friend in the race for Jamie attention. OP is the problem here.\nEdited to correct random deletion by phone.", "Thank you for explaining, I really appreciate it. I hadn't seen it that way, so now I have a better picture of it.", "IDK if OP has spent money. If I had spent money on the party, I'd want to go at least. If she just planned it, then I can absolutely see just backing out and politely saying she's sick. Another person also answered me about it and, as you said, OP does seem to be a drama monger.", "Yeah. She could have eventually chalked all this up to her own insecurity if he had not CONFIRMED IT in front of witnesses!", "Perhaps it\u2019s OPs arrogance. Kate apologized and outed her issues. She said that OP should come to the party, even knowing her own insecurities. However, where was OPs apology for inadvertently playing into those insecurities? While she\u2019s not responsible for them she did build on them. She\u2019s married and still spends quality time with another man whom she now knows has/had a thing for her. Where is her reassurance for Kate that there\u2019s no competition and that Jamie loved Kate? Where is her acknowledgment that she\u2019s emotionally attached to Jamie and she can now see it may have caused problems?\n\nNo, her response is \u201cI can\u2019t help it I\u2019m hot..\u201d", "Unfortunately that\u2019s pretty normal for a lot of women, even if they aren\u2019t a 10/10.

The marriage train was picking up speed and this was the last chance to expose her and stop it. I'm speculating his friends have been trying to derail this relationship for a while and this was the hail Mary to get him to wake up and see Kate for who she really is. If one of your friends doesn't like your partner, hey, not everyone gets along. But if all of your friends don't like your partner, that should be a huge red flag. I still remember my buddy's wedding where *all* of the groomsmen were telling the groom that she wasn't right for him and that isn't too late to call off the wedding.

I\u2019m not even her physical type.\n\nBut why is that so important? My wife finds my combination of traits (looks, personality, compatibility, etc) more attractive than anyone else. She picked the whole package, not just one trait.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like people do this with other traits. No one is insecure if their SO thinks a comedian is funnier than them, or if some mutual friend is the nicest person they ever met. So what is it about physical attractiveness that makes people act like this?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand the obsession. Of all the traits that make a good partner, physical attractiveness seems so far down the list to me I just don\u2019t get it.\n\nPlus, I know for me, my physical attraction to my wife has grown over the years. Her body type wasn\u2019t my type when I first met her, but it sure is now.", ">I mean, she\u2019s planning to marry Jamie! Does she really think he\u2019s with her because he actually thinks she\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world? Does she live in fear he might meet a beautiful celebrity one day and just drop her like nothing?\n\nShe's got a brain worm. Jamie gave it to her on accident, and she's been feeding it with her insecurities ever since, allowing it to grow into a paranoia that at any time Jamie may indeed find someone more desirable as a partner than her. Marriages don't have nearly the sort of severity that they used to. They're not *easy* to dissolve, but divorces are pretty common now, and people get divorced for a pretty wide variety of reasons, cheating being a particularly well-known cause. That knowledge (which is hammered into us pretty early on these days) plus the worm equals a whole heap of insecurity.\n\nIt's probably for the best that Kate distances herself from OP for the sake of each other's memories of their relationship, but it's definitely not enough in the long run. Her engagement, and possibly marriage, either crashes and burns because of Jamie's unintentional sabotage, survives with Kate overcoming her insecurity on her own, or survives with Kate getting some professional guidance to help her through it.\n\nSeriously people: mind your tongue at all times when dealing with people close to you, and really as a general rule when dealing with anyone. What you say may be true, and you may mean it to be an innocent comment or explanation, but that doesn't mean it can't be harmful in the long term. A single sentence can plant an idea in peoples' heads like a seed, which grows into a tree laden with doubt and sullen jealousy, and inevitably bears pain for fruit.", "There's a scene in a movie in which a man is criticized for riding a horse that's too small for his weight. His reply was that the horse was all he could catch. He would have preferred to ride a bigger horse but had to settle for the only one he could catch. Kate was Jamie's small horse. Now she knows that & her solution is to give up her friendship with op instead of breaking off her relationship with the man who admitted he would have gone for op if she wasn't out of his league. That's not the kind of thing you want in the person you're considering spending the rest of your life with.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but I think it\u2019s a little unfair to be dismissive of Kate\u2019s reaction to what Jamie and his friends said because \u2018does she really think he\u2019s with her because he actually thinks she\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world?\u2019. I also think the comparison to a celebrity is extremely disingenuous. It\u2019s hardly the same as learning that your boyfriend didn\u2019t approach your best friend because he thought she was too hot for him\u2026when you weren\u2019t.\n\nWe can criticise Kate\u2019s behaviour relating to the party without invalidating her feelings re what she learned. And Jamie\u2019s a complete dick, along with his friends. I don\u2019t care how poorly you get drunk, you\u2019re a real dick for any part of you, intoxicated or not, to say that.", "AITA for helping a friend's bf out on a difficult day for him?", "Don't forget he texted the hot friend to make sure she came because she helped organize and is so drama free and likes cool x thing that he has to text her about also.", "Right, that quotation alone would solved every problem that is currently going on", "actually the more i think about this, the fact OP was willing to make this a wedge between Kate & Jamie by telling Jamie herself is not good. She should have dealt with it with Kate. If a friend told me they were insecure about how attractive i am to their partner my reaction would absolutely not be to be offended. It would be to create some stronger boundaries toward their partner and talk with my friend about her insecurity and her relationship - because there\u2019s clearly a problem if she thinks he\u2019s thinking about other women like that. but now the whole party is about op and Kate is just being framed as insecure? I think kate was right to ask for distance.", "I felt bad for kate right up until she turned the toxicity she received onto OP.  Also, Kate knew her behavior sucked and she still doubledowned on making sure op felt like crap. AND even after understanding the whole situation, Kate sill didn't do or say anything to make amends...", "Kate is deeply insecure and emotionally reacting in a stupid way after years of jealousy and feeling like the second fiddle. I don\u2019t know if that makes her a bad person so much as pitiable.", "I think Jason is the sleep in and donut type too, lol. I would DEFINITELY give HIM a shot! A fact which my SO is well aware of, lol.", "That's a fair and righteous stance to take, kudos to you.", "> I'm sad that years of friendship has to go down the drain over Jamie because my God is he not worth it.\n\nIf it helps, it\u2019s not really because of Jamie. It\u2019s because she feels competitive with you. I have never had a friendship survive long term where either I or the other person felt we needed to compete (about anything-looks, intelligence, accomplishments).  It causes too much anxiety and insecurity and you can\u2019t fully be there for each other because one of you is always secretly hoping to be better. Anytime, I feel the least but competitive with a new acquaintance, I decide it\u2019s best to keep them in the acquaintance category. \n\nI actually lost a long term friend a couple of years ago. We were having an argument (which was extremely unusual for us) and it came out that she thinks I\u2019m better than her and she thinks that I think I\u2019m better than her. I was shocked. I assured her I absolutely do not think that, had never thought that. I don\u2019t know what I did to make her think that.  We resolved that argument and went back to being cordial but the friendship never recovered from that and we\u2019re just acquaintances now. Competition destroys friendships.", "My husband is better at almost everything than I am. It\u2019s not a competition between us but it is a fact. And I am his biggest supporter and cheerleader. But sometimes I want to do better. Sometimes I want to win the game. Sometimes I\u2019d like the outcome being me as number 1. It sounds like Kate has always been second even if it\u2019s not a competition. You don\u2019t seem to understand what that does to someone who repeatedly comes up short. I think you have been blessed with beauty that has help enhance your confidence and don\u2019t know life any other way. She wasn\u2019t trying to beat you. She was trying to have her moment of being the best. I don\u2019t think she worded it properly and certainly didn\u2019t handle it right but you seem more caught up with her accepting your are \u201cbetter\u201d and getting over it.", "I get you didn't do anything wrong, but the lack of empathy for your friend shows how much your physical appearance has shaped your way if thinking. \n\n\nI don't think Kate doesn't love you or that she started her friendship with you as a competition for male attention, but when for the entirely of your friendship every guy she has ever come into to contact with (some of which she was attracted to) chose you over her, even and specially when you weren't interested in them, is really hard not to feel like she was always losing a competition you were winning so easily you didn't even realize you were playing. Just by existing you were winning,  it was such an every day occurrence that you don't even see it. How would life feel for you if you didn't stand a chance because of a friend that you love. I think it must be really hard the dichotomy of loving someone and realizing that you'll never get to be the pretty one, even to the eyes of the guy you love.", "It is not about being 'nice', if it is not always appropriate to the situation than it is not always solid advice. Also, my prior points stand.", "Yep - I'm okay looking, I think, I don't really like my jawline or nose. But my boyfriend has specifically stated that he thinks my nose is adorable, and that he finds my jawline feminine and pretty. It turns out I'm just his type. I know there's other beautiful women and I'm sure he knows it too, but he has always made me feel like the most beautiful.", "Ugh....this hurts because this is what I go through. I have terrible body dysmorphia and a lot of insecurities. I had a really abusive mother and two abusive husbands. My first would not have sex with me on our wedding y he told me it was because he wasn't attracted to me. I asked him why he married me, and he said because he knew I'd be loyal and supportive, and I'd make a good wife. It was devastating. The damage he did that night still has a profound effect on me. And actual media and the rise of the \"internet model\" with all their edited, filtered, and photoshopped pictures have exacerbated it. It's gotten so bad that I asked my partner to not follow, search, or look at these nude/lewd models and cosolayers anymore because knowing he looks at them makes me feel mot good enough and unattractive. I know this is toxic and my issue and I'm in therapy for it, but it's a long road. A hard road. He understands and unfollowed the ones he did follow.", "He did see something in her that was special and uniquely attractive. She was with someone who caught his eye first, but he asked her out. He picked her. He didnt have to ask out EITHER woman. They are not the only two women in the world. If anything, having the OP near helped her get noticed in the first place. He was realistic with himself, weighed his odds and it seems like he is happy with his bet and feels like a winner. \n\nIt seems like this friend has felt insecure about herself throughout their friendship and thats whats really tragic. How long has she been holding resentment towards her friend? Keeping her jealousy hidden. No doubt this friend has acted with spite against the OP in some way over the years. \n\n\nThis is giving \"Yellow Jackets\" vibes.", "You know, my moment where i realized i wanted to be with this woman was her accepting the fact that i was an alcoholic and sticking with me to help me get sober and stay sober. There is so much more to relationships than just the way someone looks.

It\u2019s everything that\u2019s happened *since* that moment that matters! \u201cLove at first sight\u201d is for fairytales and stalkers. \n\nSo what if he \u201conly\u201d talked to her because he thought her friend was too hot for him? *He ended up with her!* In the AU version where he works up the guts to talk to OP, maybe they have a nice chat, or a drink, or a date, or maybe she blows him off immediately. There\u2019s NO version of this story that ends with Jamie & OP ending up together. But thankfully Kate lives in the timeline where Jamie is intimidated by OP, ends up talking to Kate, they form a meaningful connection and decide to spend the rest of their lives together! Thank whatever god or fate she believes in that OP was too hot for him because his heart knew what his penis didn\u2019t.", "I wondered exactly this. If Kate's insecurities are this strong after 3 years that she wants OP to be \"frumpy\" (when she's probably not the rest of the time) I think they must be deep-seated and likely apply to other women as well. And although it's unsaid, and better that way, I think guys often talk to the less beautiful entourage of a gorgeous woman because they too feel somewhat like Jamie, they are just smart enough not to verbalize it, and especially put their foot in their mouth. I can kind of see Jamie's point in not proposing though, if she's insecure about a friend that they both know, what's he going to face with pretty women that he knows from work, meets in another way, a server, etc. Is he going to be interrogated as to whether he finds them \"hot?\"\n\nEdit - word", ">\tMy wife finds my combination of traits (looks, personality, compatibility, etc) more attractive than anyone else.

Bodies age, sag, get sick or injured, gain and loose weight, etc etc, etc. if your \u201clove\u201d is based on how you look, that love will fade as your looks change. \n\nEven if your person is your absolute physical ideal when you meet, they won\u2019t stay that way forever. Eventually that person will age out of your physical ideal and you\u2019ll see other people who still meets that ideal. \n\nAttraction has to go deeper than looks for a relationship to last.

Then I'd tell him his friends are an absolute bunch of worthless, misogynist arseholes for the way they treated MY FRIEND, and he was an even bigger one for allowing them to treat the woman he supposedly loves like that.

No promises though.", "Is the CA in your username California or Canada? If California I wouldn't be surprised if that's a regional difference, I have definitely noticed that people seem to be skinnier there on average and maybe stores are catering to thin people too. I am in North Dakota and honestly we have a LOT of fat folks up here. I truly believe the weather makes a difference and people instinctively eat more during these cold winters.\n\nLocally I can usually find a decent array of stuff at Target, Walmart, JC Penney, and then we also have Lane Bryant and Torrid which are exclusively plus-size. The cute little boutique shops do not have my size but the big department stores usually do.", "So the only reason Jamie talked to Kate was because you happened to be there and are as hot as you are, but not because he was trying to get with you at all.

One of the hardest parts about traumatic events is that you still have to wake up to go to work as though everything were fine.  You still have to shower, groom yourself, and put on your customer service face when you want to break down and weep for hours.\n\nWhen work is about survival, there's no time to grieve or to be kind to yourself, because taking time off means not making rent or the lights being turned off.\n\nIt's a place of privilege to claim the negative experiences are the same regardless of money, because with money you do get to take a mental health day and just lay in bed.  You get to stress eat without taking food away from your family.  You get a thousand little comforts that just aren't available when you don't have money.\n\nIn my example, crying in the rain when you're safe and warm on a comfy seat in a car is very different than crying in the rain when you're cold, wet, exposed to the elements, and will still have to push yourself home once you pull it together.

You show up to the car dealer, you did your research, you have your preferences and your questions, but no matter what you say or ask, the salesperson keeps talking to the male partner. I did that, with a former boyfriend (truly nice guy btw), and afterwards, I wanted to complain together about how the salesperson never addressed me, and didn't even look at me when answering MY questions. Probably the salesperson just had deeply rooted expectations, and no bad intentions. Point is: the boyfriend had not noticed any of it, cause he was not the one who was subliminally being excluded. He was being talked to, listened to, and he got attention and friendliness, so he was comfortable in the situation. The next car dealer we went to, he paid attention to it, and then he finally saw what I had meant.\nHe is a good and kind person, but it's just extremely easy to not notice someone next to you being ignored, when you yourself are comfortable and getting attention. Meanwhile, the person who is being ignored, or seen as less important to give attention to, very actively feels that they may as well not stand there.\n\nThere's a realistic possibility that she's been feeling like this, time after time, when going out with you. Those things truly get to you. It's already annoying to be in that situation for one (impersonal) conversation, imagine how much it influences your self image if it happens all the time. \n\nI don't think her insecurities are because of how much she cares purely about looks, I think it's about the secondary effects of that, which you may not have even noticed.\n\n(Edit - one word)", "I\u2019m sorry but ESH. \n\nOP is technically in the right, but the lack of empathy is really right out there. Look, if you\u2019re the \u201chot\u201d friend, you should be aware of it and aware of how that may feel for your \u201cnot hot\u201d friend(s). You don\u2019t *have* to make accommodations for your friend, but I would. Ive done it unasked before, bc you can notice when someone doesn\u2019t get the attention that you get, and a little empathy can tell you that probably sucks and hurts and hurts their self esteem at times. That isn\u2019t your fault ofc, but as her friend, you really can\u2019t tone it down now and then to let her have the spotlight? When I know I get a lot more attention than a friend, I try to remember to step back at times and let her shine. You don\u2019t have to look ugly, just wear slacks and a sweater and keep the look minimal. It\u2019s one night cmon. \n\nThat said, I\u2019ve never actually had a friend come out and ask me to tone myself down for her. I think if kate can\u2019t handle being friends with someone who draws so much more attention than her, she should probably end the friendship. I feel for her insecurity, and hearing what Jamie and his friends said about the two of you must have been a huge blow, but she shouldn\u2019t make her insecurities your problem. \n\nJamie sucks bc he knows his gf feels insecure bc of OP, he knows exactly why, tbh it\u2019s kind on him to keep contact with OP minimal.

I\u2019ve always been the fat (even when I wasn\u2019t) and unattractive friend of my friend group and we\u2019ve been friends for about half our lives now and it really just crushes your spirit as a person. I really hope that not only you and Kate find a way to repair and move forward with your friendship, but that she finds help with her self-esteem and takes a look at her relationship. My bf is amazing and never leaves room for me to feel like I\u2019m the most beautiful woman in the world to him and even with that I still have some days where I can\u2019t understand why he\u2019s with someone like me. I honestly can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d get over knowing that I even came in second place to the man I love. \n\nIt really sucks that you got mixed up in all this as an innocent bystander. It sounds like you\u2019re actually the kind of supportive voice that someone like Kate would need. But taking a step back from all this is definitely a good idea for you.", "Having self esteem issues does eat at you and at it's worst, may cause more issues. I am sorry you are losing a long time friend.

It's just not easy for guys and girls to be friends all the time and we should all accept this and be reasonable. \n\nForming a friendship with your friend's bf while she simultaneously (it's not like you were friends before) develops her relationship with him is a little disrespectful to your friend. You can be his friend, but doing it as a separate thing from Kate is weird. \n\nI would be annoyed at him going to sports games with you one-on-one and texting you, especially if I heard that Jamie originally wanted you. Also if she said \"do I really have to ask?\" about the outfit situation, I have a feeling you know ALL of this. \n\nWas her request uncalled for? Yes. Do I get why she did it? Yes. \n\nI feel bad for Kate and I'd probably just ditch you both and break free from the unspoken bullshit.", "Nothing sad about there not being a future for Kate and Jamie.

Kate framed the question to be \"Why did you NOT talk to OP that night?\" \n\nAnd I know we're arguing semantics here, but the 2 different phrases of the similar question is vastly different from each other. Jamie could have phrased the first question as a genuine reason, but by phrasing it the way she did she was trying to force Jamie to say something negative about OP in that moment. \n\nJamie's friends are the biggest AH's in this whole story (because why would you ever say that to a person?), but Kate also shouldn't phrase questions in a way she did.", "> I don't believe he ever thought of Kate as second fiddle. \n\nExcept he did.

Saying she wouldn't be living her current lifestyle without it. That she dates rich men. That Jamie thinks he could date her if he was richer. That she doesn't work. That her husband certainly wasn't the most attractive person in the room. That there's a lot of money and effort that goes into making her look good. \n\n\nBut the idea that this guy is into her and her friend is jealous? Super weird! unimaginable! She's only rich and hot and takes this guy to sporting events he couldn't otherwise afford, what's to be jealous about?!\n\n\n\nOr to explain it to OP. Imagine that the day your husband met you he was with a friend who was richer, more established, more suave.

It most definitely comes across like Kate was second choice but he absolutely would try it with you if he could. I\u2019m sure Kate has picked up on this but assumed it was her insecurity speaking if this is only now coming out. \n\nI think Jamie and his friends aren\u2019t good people or friends though. Why did he not defend his GF, someone he wanted to propose to? From his so called friends? \n\nIdk this whole situation seems a mess.

A guy who initially thought \"wow that girl is hot\" but then fell for her best friend would never be willing to divulge that info - and definitely not to the girl he initially found hot. \n\nJamie's allowance of his friends saying Kate is ugly, his repeating that she was the consolation pick to those friends in front of her, and then his telling you, the og object of his desire, that she was a consolation prize and he'd have gone after you if he thought he stood a chance - all of that is extremely inappropriate and nothing something that good men do. \n\nIt is, however, something men who are putting out feelers to see if there's a little chance with a hot girl would do. Jamie feels like he settled for Kate, so he's OK with her being mad at him for putting her down. He feels she won't leave even if he is sometimes insulting, because he thinks he's out of her league a bit.

Here\u2019s the thing though, all women regardless of their appearance are objectified, but conventional beauty dictates the manner in which this occurs.  Imagine being considered unattractive to men, told you aren\u2019t valuable or sexually desirable, yet still somehow being sexually objectified and being expected to want to compete for men\u2019s attention. I understand the experience of a conventionally attractive woman is also traumatic, but having been on both sides myself I can say that I am profoundly disturbed by how much better men treat me. Women can\u2019t win no matter how we look tbh, but whenever a woman who has never been treated as ugly by most people around her tries to leverage the traumas of being hot, I struggle to empathize quite as much because being on the other side is brutal, similar, but people are just very hostile to you.", "...Do you really not see how this is different from your husband seeing *you* and thinking *you* weren't the hot one?\n\nEasy for you to say when you're the one doing the deciding about who's hot.

That is not empathy. And to that end, ever thought maybe he'd be hurt reading this comment? Before you say he's not, okay, he's one man.

I wasn't making a bad attempt at putting myself in Kate's shoes or judging how she felt or I would have felt. I was saying that me not immediately noticing my husband in a crowded room doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of our relationship, just like it might not have meant anything in the grand scheme of things to Jamie. \n\nAnd just because you asked, no my husband wouldn't be offended.

I'm bringing this up because as women, whether we like it or not, we are usually compared against eachother by men. No, not all men are like that and no, not all women would be insecure in their friendships BUT society's pressure for women to be ridiculously beautiful at all times and at all ages has impacted us at least one point in our lives.

By your logic, everyone that triggered her insecurities whether intentional or not needs to also apologize.  \n\n\nOP probably lacks perspective, but none of it is out of malice for Kate", "Why do you think the solution is for all women to compete in the rat race of cosmetic procedures to feel good about themselves?

The boob job was a lift and a minuscule reduction, when I'm clothed you can't see the difference, I had it to correct the effects of years of eating disorders. I had a minor revision to my nose that my dad to this day doesn't know about because he can't see the difference. And neither of these things I fixed so that I could be more attractive to men. Men did not treat me any differently post surgery. But yes, I can acknowledge, and my husband and I have acknowledged this between us, that if I wasn't physically attractive to him, we wouldn't be in a relationship. That's not the main reason we're in a relationship, but it's the reason he decided to get to know me. Now, he probably doesn't care about the wrapping as much anymore.\n\nI've never said looks don't matter. I've said they probably shouldn't as much as they do because they don't mean anything. I've said they don't matter to me. Both of those things are true.

I had eating disorders too, I know the effect it has on the skin and have also considered breast lifts - I'm not shaming plastic surgery, I want that to be VERY clear. Whether it was minor physical changes or EEE implants, it's still a major surgery, there are serious risks and side effects. Don't minimize the severity of surgeries. My point is that you got surgery (and all the risks that came with it) because you were unhappy with how you looked. You got it not because of medical reasons but because you wanted to look more beautiful. No shame in that,the point is that beauty is important enough for you to get surgery. Looks DO matter to you. Most people want to be beautiful and feel comfortable in their own skin. Why is it so shameful to admit that?\n\nThe connections that happen after the first date are irrelevant because there wouldn't have been a first date to get that connection without your looks. Your comment implies that the only reason your husband wanted that first date was because he found you the most beautiful, thanks to your plastic surgeries. This is the issue with Kate's situation. Your husband approached you because of your beauty, Kate's boyfriend approached her because of YOUR beauty.\n\nETA: Again, the whole reason I'm bringing this up is because of your lack of empathy to Kate. You don't seem to acknowledge the effect society has on women and the pressure to be beautiful and what that means to women who are not \"conventionally attractive.\" Not to mention, your need to defend your surgeries and it being \"minor\" reflects how society also demands women to be ridiculously beautiful but also it be done \"naturally,\" otherwise it's not \"true\" beauty.", "That makes this all the more ridiculous.

I've known the guy 3 years, albeit peripherally, and we're such different people, I don't think he'd ever like *me*, even if in another lifetime he would like to be with someone *like* me.", "I\u2019ve been in your friend\u2019s position. We will just never be the ones to stand out in our friend groups, always left standing alone. She needs to block those \u201cfriends\u201d and you should too tbh if you know them. And he needs to learn to wear a muzzle. Pent up jealousy can make people do irrational things. Such as a dress code. \n\nMy similar situation: I dated a guy in college for years after he SA\u2019d me because I felt no one else would like me. Also he dated me bc he knew he wasn\u2019t attractive enough for my best friend. No one liked me in high school and actually no one has hit on me since that relationship and haven\u2019t been on a date. No matter my appearance, I\u2019m not putting myself through that BS for a man. Also, I was in a group of 15 girls at a club and every girl was dancing with someone and I was left standing on my own awkwardly and I ran home and cried. I felt stupid but it still hurt. I\u2019ve learned to be happy single for almost 3 years, but it doesn\u2019t mean the feeling of jealousy doesn\u2019t arise here and there. So I feel for the both of you as I can see both sides of this.", "Damn as badly as Kate handled this I really feel for her. There\u2019s no way someone could handle that well. \u201cYeah I knew I didn\u2019t have a chance with the hot friend so I hit on you and it turned out well\u201d ouch talk about a hell of a gut punch. Idk how a relationship would recover from that", "Man, even though she was a butthole about the dress code I feel so bad for her. The horrible humiliating feeling of being chosen because you're just unattractive enough that you're thought to be easier to get, while in comparison your close friend is the one really wanted but isn't approached because the risk is too high that the man will get rejected because the friend so attractive. This is awful enough in a one night stand instance, but to find out after a long time of being with someone, going to get engaged to and after you've watched your bf become really close friends with your friend who he really wanted initially. Sad stuff, sorry you're in such a weird situation.", "I'm very sad for Kate. I know how that feels, always being the ugly/less attractive one next to your friend but hearing this shit from her boyfriend of 3 years is absolutely heartbreaking. I honestly couldn't stay in a relationship after something like that and I also would distance myself from the friends that make me feel small whether it's on purpose or not. In order to be confident she needs to first work on that and she can't do that if she frequently has to feel like an ugly duckling next to you. That really sucks for you and your friendship but if she's already in this mindset then it'll be damn near impossible to get out of it. You didn't do anything wrong. She kinda did but her boyfriend sucks ass. Honestly sometimes it's okay to lie about stuff like that.", "If his friends are joking about it 3 years after it happened\u2026we\u2019ll he\u2019s definitely been joking about it/telling them about that story in a very unsavoury and memorable way. As in at kates expense. He\u2019s an asshole.", "I knew some girls exactly like this at university; one was a part-time personal trainer who was very fit, tall, blonde, classically attractive etc.  Her friend was shorter, soft spoken and what I would describe as 'cute' as opposed to immediately gorgeous. \n\nAt a 21st at a bar once the shorter girl was chatting to a guy and asked me to distract her friend because, 'She always distracts guys I talk to.' I tried my best but the taller girl was rather drunk and ended up barging into their conversation.  The way the guy immediately switched to talking to the taller girl really made me understand that this was a common thing in their friendship.\n\nThey were still friends but I could see that the shorter girl was upset whenever this happened and it really got to her how much more attention her friend got.", "It's a horrible situation for both of you women.  Your bad spot in it is obvious and I won't belabor that.  However it also sucks to always be the lesser attractive of 2 friends, and then finally find a great match, and then to later find out that yeah, he thought you were hotter just like all the other guys.\n\nA total gut punch for your friend.  Is she handling it perfectly? Hell no!  But the constant overshadowing can be brutal for the 2nd place woman so I have empathy for her.\n\nHonestly everyone would of been better off if that particular conversation had never happened.\n\nSort of like a guy asking his partner if he is the \"biggest\".  What a fucking stupid question that you don't want to know the answer to.\n\nBy the way, your stance in the original post of not going due to the dress code was 100% right.  Due to her insecurities you were doing her a favor by not going if it was that bad!", "I\u2019m sorry for Kate. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d handle that.", "Hearing that her BF is your +1 for sporting events (I\u2019m assuming without her?) is a little cringe inducing considering the circumstances. You\u2019re NTA but I do understand this girl\u2019s crushing insecurity. It\u2019s definitely best to distance yourself from both of them", "1. Jamie's friend - the one who said the thing about how Jamie picked Kate, because \"he didn't have a shot with \"the hot one\"\", needs to not be a friend anymore. Or at least to maintain a respectful distance.\n2. Not sure how much you pressed Kate to give you a reason for the odd \"dress code\", but I wouldn't have called Jamie regardless. She was your friend first and I would have straight up told her to spill the reason or I'd be contacting Jamie. So no matter what people encouraged you to do in the OG post, this was the only decent thing to do.\n3. Jamie saying that he won't be proposing, BECAUSE of how she took his bumbling mistake is the cherry on top for this whole journey. Yes, proposing at this time isn't a good idea. But it's not because of her. It's because of how he made her feel. Yeah, insecurities suck and she can hopefully work through them, but he made it 100% worse.\n4. Not going to the party is the better decision for you, that's for sure.\n5. Something about the fact that Jamie told you he wasn't going to propose, party because of how Kate treated you, tells me he also doesn't think of her as highly as he thinks of you. Maybe that's not a good explanation for why it irks me, but it just does even if there's no logical reason.\n6. Finally, the friends that don't like Kate very much can go f themselves. This whole thing probably began, because of their malice towards her. I imagine some of them knew about the planned proposal and felt some kind of way.", "WOW, Jamie and his friends are the worst. I hope she dumps him. There is really no coming back from that.\n\nIt'd be like her telling him \"yeah, I wasn't going to date you because your dick and your paycheck are SO much smaller than your brother's, but he was out of my league, so I settled, and you turned out to be nice enough.\"\n\nThe well is permanently poisoned. She'll never believe another compliment that comes out of his mouth, and if she does, it will always with a \"but....not as as good as __\" or \"but he wishes I was actually....\" added to the end.\n\nIt's very telling that Jamie is *still* saying he knows you're out of his league, and that he's now withholding proposing almost as a sort of punishment because Kate's reaction isn't what he wants and is highlighting exactly how badly he's damaged her from this. (I have little doubt she knows or suspects he plans to propose during this party, prompting her desire to be the prettiest in the room, and when he doesn't, it's going to be bad)\n\nHe also hasn't ripped his friends a new one or gotten different friends. I don't buy him being all that in love with her if he's so nonchalant about his chances of marrying her burning down to ash, yet he's still trying to get the OP to come to his party.\n\nETA: I just read the comments that his *boss* was the one who brought him over to talk to the pair of you. He had the perfect explanation right there: \"Why did you talk to me?\" \"*My boss* was interested in OP and I was being wingman.\" But nope, he went into details about how he noticed the OP across the room, thought she was gorgeous, how he was attracted but knew he couldn't get her, and settled for the dowdy friend. Absolutely NONE of that was necessary.", "I think Kate deserves someone better. It must really hurt to have heard she was the second choice and that OP was \u201cout of his league.\u201d \n\n\nThis all reminded me of how one of my friends met her husband. She was out to lunch with a friend of hers who was a model, and was always \u201coutshined\u201d by that friend when they were out, as she put it. A guy walks up to her as she\u2019s waiting to get more fries and starts teasing her, then after a back and forth asks if he could take her to lunch sometime.\n\n\nThe question came up when we were all talking one day of why he didn\u2019t go for her model friend and he said, \u201cwell? She wasn\u2019t you. I just thought you were so cute!\u201d They\u2019ve been together a long time now.\n\n\nI hope Kate finds someone like that one day.", "You and your friend deserve better.", "Oh gross, so turns out Jamie is TA. I feel for Kate. I don\u2019t care how drunk he was or even honestly who he immediately found more attractive. Obviously it\u2019s nicer if it was actually Kate, but at worst, you lie. Maybe it\u2019s an unpopular opinion but a small lie is less harmful than riddling your partner with insecurity over a question they don\u2019t actually want the honest answer to. And now he\u2019s not proposing because.. why? My advice to Kate is to start fresh with a new one that isn\u2019t secretly into her friend.", "Your update sucks", "I think choosing to just skip the whole deal is the right choice. It sucks when you realize things are not how you thought they were, it feels icky. Maybe you should just go out of town with your husband.", "Obviously, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but I feel so bad for Kate. It would be devastating to me if my partner told me he wanted my friend, but settled on me because she\u2019s out of his league! \n\nFor her sake, it\u2019s probably best you don\u2019t attend the party.", "I\u2019d say \u201cwoman to woman let\u2019s go get a drink and have a good chat/laugh/cry about life\u201d if I was in your friends circle.

But the thing that makes me think Jaime is an AH not just an idiot is the way he's reacting to her unhappiness. \n\nI could completely understand him taking your side and calling off the engagement if her motivation for acting strangely with you was pure spite and meanness, but in this case it's well-founded jealousy caused by something HE said. \n\n It sounds like he (and his friends) actually want Kate to kind of accept she's second best, and if she can't do that gracefully, he doesn't want to marry her.  Frankly there's something little bit...odd about that attitude and i can't quite put my finger on it. Like they want her to know her place? I don't envy Kate much at all.\n\nI hope that the two of you can patch things up somehow because i think the time will come when she might really need a good friend.", "Glad I read this update AFTER the final update. I agree that this situation just doesn't seem to be worth it. Def sucks a bit but I'd graciously back out of these two people's lives... There's obviously weird chemistry and awkwardness and insecurities that aren't gonna be going anywhere.", "For the update:  good for you!  I wish you well.  Setting healthy boundaries will most definitely lead you to better relationships.", "This was a whole roller-coaster ride. Good thing you decided on not going as it's most likely for the best for everyone. Her BF seems to still be fancied of you and probably had a thought or two on getting with you through your friend which honestly.... would ultimately break your friendship in the worst way possible. Plus his friends are such jerks too. I feel incredibly sorry for Kate and I truly hope you two girl can figure this out and fight this together. Jamie has given a preview of his true colors so carefully consider it.", "Yeah, it's best if you don't go at all. Too many awkward feelings are being revealed and it'll just be bad for you to go to the party pretending everything is fine.", "I really hope poor Kate gets out of this relationship. He sounds like a jerk.", "What a sad situation\u2026just thinking before drunk speaking might have made this entire mess nonexistent. Jamie started the ball rolling with his answer, Kate who already had self esteem issues, internalize it and changed how she sees him and her hot friend. Then the mess was dumped onto the hot friend \u2026not sure this is even fixable. The ball is in Jamie's court. How he'll fix this is beyond me.", "She didn't ask \"do I look fat in this dress\" she asked her boyfriend what attracted him to her.

This needs to be higher up!!  OP READ THIS!", "This! It sounds like Kate needs a friend. Honestly I don\u2019t see how she can still be with him. What he and his friends said will always nag at her self esteem - even if you\u2019re not there. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t deserve her. We each should be with someone who cherishes us -  not because we were their second choice. Sounds like Jamie may still be pining for you too.", "I get the feeling he\u2019s not proposing because Kate is stepping back from her friendship with OP.  \n\nNo friendship = no legitimate access to OP for Jamie.  He\u2019s just using Kate\u2019s behaviour as an excuse.  \n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of OP\u2019s responses and she defends this guy to the hilt.  Her only \u2018lightbulb\u2019 moment was thinking back to creepy comments Jamie made about HER, not how he treats Kate.  Or allows Kate to be treated by his friends.  \n\nI really feel for Kate.  I hope she\u2019s got the strength to send them both packing.  I\u2019m willing to bet if we heard her side, a lot more emotionally abusive behaviour would come to light.  \n\nKate called OP, dropping the dress code and begging OP to come.  What\u2019s the bets Jamie threatened to dump her if OP wasn\u2019t at his party?  It\u2019s pretty obvious where his loyalty lies.", "Wow. You are so clever and hilarious.", "Jamie definitely should not have said what he said, which is why I wrote that he needs to learn how to drink and not shoot off his mouth.", "Sounds like she looks down on most of these people from what I saw in other comments.  I wonder why they're even friends.", "Agree. On first glance Kate seemed problematic but now I\u2019m on her side. Kate wasn\u2019t bothered by them going out to sporting events and having a friendship. Even with OP being seemingly more objectively attractive. It\u2019s this layer of, my partner *is* attracted to her and would have pursued her but isn\u2019t \u2018in her league\u2019 that bothered Kate. \n\nAlso not sure about OP\u2026 it\u2019s either that she just can\u2019t relate and is unwilling to see Kate\u2019s side because she was 1) offended by being asked to tone down her looks (not judging that, it\u2019s a weird ask) or 2) that she can\u2019t try to be empathetic bc she is choosing not to be. Something about looks being something that shouldn\u2019t be an issue (bc it\u2019s not for her) so she\u2019s unwilling to see that it\u2019s a problem for Kate as it relates to her bf confessing that he would have chosen OP if he were able to be chosen by her. Deeply hurtful. And imo if OP was willing to step into Kate\u2019s shoes she would try to understand that pain and put her pride (yes, getting hints of ego here) aside and reach out to Kate instead of eye rolling \u201clooks are so unimportant\u201d\u2026.", "SHE'S causing? The drama was caused by him!", "To be fair, you said you are a stay at home wife with a stylist who goes to a lot of events. Your job is basically being arm candy for your husband. Of course you don\u2019t see any competition with your less hot friend\u2026.you are always winning.", "Why does it matter so much what the initial reason for approach was? Plenty of good things come out of unintentional or accidental circumstances. Just because she wasn't special to him the first millisecond he saw her doesn't mean that she's not special now that he has gotten to know her and developed a relationship. If currently she is now the most special person in his life then what does it matter his first thoughts when he saw her? \n\nYes it can sting to know the truth, and probably he should have lied or at least been more tactful in his answer to her question, but with the information available it really doesn't seem like anything Jamie did was wrong.", "Yeah, this relationship is closing in on the finish line.", "It's a toss up I suppose. In my area and among my friend group it's a positive to address issues with one another and stick up for your friends. I'll admit that's not the norm for everyone.", "Completely agree with you.", "And now that Kate and the OP have parted ways, he's decided to postpone the proposal. It's almost like he was happy with his consolation prize BECAUSE he got those few special one-on-one times with the \"the hot one\".

What is she going to do? Stop being friends with anyone who could possibly be considered more attractive because her ego is so fragile?", "This needs to be higher. I've never seen OP defend Kate, but she is defending Jamie so much.", "Ehh Idk if I\u2019d want to propose to someone or be proposed to in the middle of something like this. I\u2019d want to be in great terms with the other person\u2026 but feel like it was a pitty proposal.", "FOR REALS. OP is being handled with kid's gloves because her friend was initially shitty. OP, the fact that you are not absolutely shutting Jamie's shit down makes everything you're saying disingenuous.", "Except, Jamie is still making comments that he thinks that you are better than Kate, even to your own husband, OP. According to Jamie, you deserve a new car and to be 'spoiled'... but his own gf doesn't? Jamie doesn't appear to think much at all about Kate.

It handwaves a lot of unkindness and responsibility to speak not only with frankness, but consideration as well.\n\nA much more practical axiom I adhere to is, \"not every though or 'truth' in my head need be spoken\".", "Exactly. Bc if Kate isn't his first choice, she won't be his last. He's always going to be looking and thinking and hoping for something else.\n\nProof is how easily he decided to drop the proposal and told OP but never told Kate or tried to talk thru things with Kate.  If Kate told him, she settled for him bc his brother was too hot for her, he'd not handle it well either.", "He kind of made things even worse by saying he thought he didn't have a chance in hell with someone like OP which makes Kate think \"well I've got better luck with you because you're not hot enough to be out of my league.\"\n\nNeither Kate or OP are at fault here but they're the ones who lose out because of some thoughtless dipsticks.", "Not to mention we dont know the backstory of OP and Kates relationship.\n\nThey may have gone through school together where Kate has spent essentially her entire teen and adult life involved with OP, if she is far more conventionally attractive then she would have spent this entire time being mostly an afterthought when compared in this way to OP.  \nThis could be years and years of watching OP 'win' cause of her looks.\n\nFinally, someone picks her over OP only for that bubble to be instantly shattered and reality set in again.\n\nJamie should have kept his dumb mouth shut, or rather lied.  \nWho cares if OP was more attractive, say you approached Kate simply because you noticed her instantly from across the room and couldn't control yourself. Even if its a lie its better than to say 'oh its cause your not hot and I cant pull hot birds'", "To add a bit of nuance to this, at this point, there is *nothing* Jamie could say to Kate that would reassure her enough. This will be an albatross hanging around his neck for the duration of the relationship. He will have to *constantly* apologize for, and make gestures to counter his ill-advised comment. *And it will never be enough*, because, Kate *already* doesn't think *she's enough*.\n\nNo matter how legitimate Kate's feelings are, these are the facts.\n\nKnowing this, do you blame him for coming to this conclusion?", "This is why people should never meet in person first!\n\nI never have to worry about that because my husband met me in a Yahoo chat room!

And you say if you didn't look the way you did, you wouldn't be married to your husband. Yeah, that's all real petty stuff.\n\nI agree with u/SpeechIll6025 and am ready for downvotes, you seem very disingenuous over everything and I too think you enjoy being the hot one that doesn't care about looks. Me thinks the lady doth protest too much or whatever.", "You are VERY disingenuous. Holy crap.

Meeting the right person is as much kismet as it is effort. \n\nI guess it can be different if you look at glasses as half full or half empty. In my mind I would be happy that my hot friend got the person I ended up loving close to me - they were the freeway that got him to the destination. I wouldn't care if it was my friends looks that brought them over, if they ended up choosing me because I am who I am. I'm not conventionally attractive but I like to think I have a great sense of humor and personality, and I would not be offended to find that someone wasn't attracted to me at first glance. I'd be offended if people didn't want to consider a relationship with me because of that alone, but also I don't want to be with that kind of person. Maybe I'm just thinking better about myself, maybe I would feel the same as the friend. \n\nBut at the end of the day, friend feels how she feels and has to make a decision she feels is right for her.

But an unfolding narrative of who his first choice may have been coupled with his confirmation years later of said story would make even the most secure of women feel a way. \n\nAnd the fact that he\u2019s done a 180 and is now deciding to hold off on the proposal seems weird me. Is he suddenly conflicted because his future \u201cwife\u201d would certainly sever any association he attempted to have with OP?", "I think it's more...they both met Jamie that night and it sounds like they were all single. Jamie chats up the friend and realizes they click great and have their relationship and it's happily ever after...until this came up. \n\nIt's just that now the friend knows that only happened because he thought OP would never give him the time of day. \n\nMaybe if Jamie  had more confidence he'd have tried something with OP and it wouldn't have worked out and he'd connect more with the friend anyway but we don't know. \n\nAll the friend knows is that she was chosen specifically for being less attractive and thus more approachable and you don't just up and tell someone that!", "Yeah, I really feel for Kate. That was a hell of a thing for Jamie to say, I don\u2019t think that bell can be unrung. I hope Kate can get past this in a healthy way and lay the blame with Jamie and his trash friends where it belongs.\n\nI also feel for OP, it really sucks to find out you\u2019ve been part of a competition that you didn\u2019t choose. I had a really beautiful friend when I was younger and I saw the shit some other girls put her through because of their insecurities, it was really mean! I hated that people tried to dim her shine.\n\nAlso, your username is amazing.", "What if your friends are alerting you to red flags and you are just dismissing them?", "It\u2019s not just self worth. It\u2019s economic worth too. The more attractive you are, the more likely you are to get promotions and raises at work. Studies show what we all understand instinctively: your worth in society is tied to your appearance. I love it when \u201chot\u201d people say \u201cit\u2019s all relative\u201d when it most certainly isn\u2019t, or get upset when they\u2019re told they have \u201cpretty privilege\u201d and deny that it\u2019s a thing. As an old married woman, I will echo that appearance will only get you so far in life and won\u2019t make a relationship stick. It\u2019s interesting when you observe someone who\u2019s got by in life on their looks, or flirts their way through everything, get shot down by someone who doesn\u2019t care to be manipulated that way. They\u2019ve not built up any other skill set if that\u2019s their go-to, and are genuinely shocked that it\u2019s not going to work.", "Worse than inconsiderate; HE caused all this drama, and I'm wondering if it was intentional. This is negging.", "Part of the problem is that looks make people treat you better, which builds your self-confidence, which objectively makes you hotter, and then even as you get old, fat, or burnt in a house fire, you still have that.\n\nSo looks don't actually matter so much as one's sense of a right to take up space and be listened to, but oh look, they sure do make that easier to cultivate.", "Honestly,  lucky her to find out now. If you love someone you don't say obvious hurtful things to them.", "Oh been there done that. Met one of my then bfs (now husband ) friends gfs and I really thought we could be friends. That was the first night my the  bf got absolutely wasted in front of me and basically told me he was and always would be in love with this girl. That she had a heart of gold that she was so beautiful. I asked if he had feelings for her he said she\u2019d alway have a special place in his heart. Fast forward I couldn\u2019t get over it. It became a problem. That girl and the friend are still together I finally came clean to her 3 years later after tensions and tons of awkward kick backs. She was drunk when we talked about this. I cried and explained and told her how devastated I was and it made it hard to even look at her or even think about her sometimes. She was mad he did that. I thought it would get better but it didn\u2019t. \n\nIt was all enhanced by the fact that before that night he REFUSED to get wasted with me. But that night I had to tell him to slow down and take drinks from him. In my mind that meant he was upset she was there with him. \n\nThe following time we all hung out (husband basically forced me to go) she talked shit about me to my husband told him I was crazy (bpd) and said \u201cgood luck with her\u201d like we weren\u2019t already married. \n\nI lost it and burned a lot of bridges that night. \n\nThe things that happen because people drink past their limits is crazy.", "This. Yta, OP.", "This reminds me of shit my ex pulled with one of his friends who became a model later on. Basically he told me he would sleep with her, then as a reaction to me being upset about this, he discussed it with her, basically letting her know he would sleep woth her then they together talked about how much of an idiot i am for being bothered. :D", "For me, and I don't know but maybe for you too, people literally look more or less attractive that more I get to know about them. I've had people I thought were stunning, but when I talked to them for a few minutes, my brain started perceiving them as... I don't know exactly how to put it. Kind of like their appearance lost depth or luster. Others I've seen are 100% out of my type when I first see them. Then we talk for a moment or see something about how they move or interact with others and they become more attractive.\n\nMy understanding is that this isn't true for everyone - at least to the degree it is for me. It's possible that this is true for you and not them, so your experience around your relationship is fundamentally different. It's also possible it's true for Jamie and just not for Kate. Or it's true for Jamie and he just doesn't have the awareness of it to explain it to Kate. Or maybe that it wouldn't matter even if he told her.", "I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s fair for you to say that looks mean nothing. You\u2019re hot. You worked hard and paid $$$ to be as attractive as you are. People notice you. People treat you better than others.", "I get what you're trying to say, but as someone that has a very unattractive face (nothing make up could fix, the face structure is just bad naturally), has been bullied and treated differently for it for as long as I can remember, I know better than anyone that looks matter much more than lots of people are willing to admit. You yourself said that your husband go to you because he find you very physically attractive from across the room. Of course your relationship lasted because he's a good partner and you guys are compatible, but you wouldn't had the opportunity to even know him, if he didn't go to you. It's like if rich people says money doesn't matter, that's only because they never have to worry about money. It would be different for people that have to live in homeless shelter for instance, any bucks matter to their survival.", "Yeah no matter how wonderful your relationship has been, nobody likes hearing it only ever started in the first place because you were the plan b option.", "Yeah it reads like everything was okay until a couple of months ago at the drinks with his friends when he kind of admitted that he spoke with her because he thought he wouldn't have a hope in hell with OP. Maybe there was always an element of \"he picked me over her\" for Kate and it bolstered her self esteem thinking that she had some quality that made her stand out to Jamie, but it all evaporated that night and all the old insecurities came rushing back hearing that she was picked because she wasn't \"out of his league\" gorgeous.", "It is sad that she developed an insecuritie because someone else hit on you while he stood next to them. Jamie  hit on your friend who was next to you and from day one thought that you were \"hot,\" but he didn't think to try. That situation was great for her. She needs to look at it a different way. \n\nHear me out, Jamie saw you, thought you were attractive, and said, \"Nope, not gonna waste my time.\"  Then he saw his gf while his boss was buttering you up and he thought, \" She's pretty and she is just my speed!\" Then he shot his shot and scored! She should be thinking that she is simultaneously cute AND approachable!! If it was me, I would be thinking, \" The face pulls em in, and the personality hooks em for good!\" I would feel like you had the untouchable hotness vibe while I had the down to earth hotness vibe from the description of that night. \n\n   IF she started to see the silver lining of this situation, she could see that it was NEVER a competition. You both are hot, but you are attracting different guys with different vibes. You are the best wing woman out there. Instead of a carbon copy of the same girl over and over, you each were unique, and thus, different people were attracted, and Moore eyes looked at your group that night. \n\nHopefully, she gets off this comparison problem.  She needs to see that her friends her inner beauty and strength are the most important things and that loyalty and friendship are things that make a person even more beautiful to a partner."]}
