Most responses were not what I was expecting and really gave me a lot to think about.\n\nAs surprised as I was that so many people said to tell Jamie, I did realise it was the right thing to do. So, I texted him and told him that Kate was insisting I dressed a certain way. Jamie called and explained. A couple of months ago, Jamie and Kate were out with a few of his friends (these same friends that I mentioned in my comments are not fond of Kate), and everyone had had a lot to drink. They were talking about how they met their SOs, and the story of Jamie and Kate meeting came up. Apparently during the telling of the story Kate asked Jamie why he had decided to hit on her rather than me, and one of his friends joked that it was because he knew he didn't have a shot with \"the hot one\" - me. Kate asked if this was true, and Jamie having had WAY too much to drink, explained in a way that made it sound kind of true.\n\nHe said he did notice me that night and thought I was attractive, just seeing me. He said he would never have approached me because he knew he would never have a chance with someone like me, so in that way, his friend was right. He said that speaking to Kate was the absolute best outcome because he loves her and plans on spending the rest of his life with her, but even knowing this, Kate has taken this extremely hard, and even though she says she is over it, he's noticed changes in her behaviour that seem to be related to that. He also admitted that he'd been planning to propose to Kate at the party and that is why he'd wanted me to be there, but after hearing this on top of the way she has been handling the situation previously, he won't be doing that anymore.\n\nAfter speaking to Jamie, I called Kate. She admitted that she had tied a lot of her self worth in the fact that she'd finally been picked over me and now it felt like that wasn't true. She apologised for trying to solve her insecurities through me, but also said she wasn't sure she would be able to have me in her life as much as I had been with the way she's been feeling. As hurt as I was, I said I understood. She said she still wanted me to come to the party, since I'd helped organise it and she obviously dropped the absurd dress code, so I will be going to the party. I trust that Kate will communicate her boundaries to Jamie but I don't plan on inviting him to any more events for the foreseeable future.\n\nI'm really sad that I've probably lost a longtime friend over the drunken awkwardness of other people, but I also get that Kate can't help how she feels, and frankly it's for the best not to be in a secret competition. So, yeah, I'm hurt, but I'm going to the party. Not a satisfying update, but an honest one.", "created_utc": 1679398517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xe70g/update_my_friend_asked_me_to_dress_badly_to_her/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Jamie\u2019s friend was a real dick for putting him in that situation. But at the end of the day you\u2019re pretty much garanteed to not be the first attractive  person your partner has ever seen. It was an unreasonable situation but I\u2019m glad that in the end everyone was as reasonable as possible", "It's too bad that Jamie's friends are jerks, and Jamie needs to learn how to hold his liquor so he can control his mouth. Kate has hopefully learned the lesson that you shouldn't ask a question if you don't want to know the answer. I am sorry that your friendship has been damaged by this, and I know that it is hurtful to you. I hope that Kate is able to work on herself so that the two of you can eventually pick back up your friendship.  \nThank you for the update.", "wow i really feel for you and kate and can say that jamie is definitely not worth breaking up your friendship. i hope she realizes that", "Jamie sounds like a real piece of work with bad taste in friends, so you dodged a bullet there. That's not something you should say in front of your partner. I hope Kate gets out of this relationship before it gets any more serious and you two can mend fences, but either way be glad he didn't think he had a shot with you and that you can just walk away from this while drama filled mess.", "This is heartbreaking for Kate. You did nothing wrong, and she obviously was out of line with what she asked of you, but I can\u2019t imagine hearing your partner say that would be an easy thing to get over, especially if she\u2019s insecure. She shouldn\u2019t have asked, he shouldn\u2019t have said what he did or exposed her to his friends if they have a history of not treating her well. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re losing a good friend over this!\n\nI hope she takes a step back from him and you guys patch things up, their relationship doesn\u2019t sound all that healthy.", "I\u2019m sorry that your friendship with Kate has taken a hit over this, especially since most of the conflict over this situation was caused by Jamie\u2019s friends and Jamie himself.", "What a sad situation.", "> A couple of months ago, Jamie and Kate were out with a few of his friends (these same friends that I mentioned in my comments are not fond of Kate), and everyone had had a lot to drink.
