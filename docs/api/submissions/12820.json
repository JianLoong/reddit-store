Most responses were not what I was expecting and really gave me a lot to think about.\n\nAs surprised as I was that so many people said to tell Jamie, I did realise it was the right thing to do. So, I texted him and told him that Kate was insisting I dressed a certain way. Jamie called and explained. A couple of months ago, Jamie and Kate were out with a few of his friends (these same friends that I mentioned in my comments are not fond of Kate), and everyone had had a lot to drink. They were talking about how they met their SOs, and the story of Jamie and Kate meeting came up. Apparently during the telling of the story Kate asked Jamie why he had decided to hit on her rather than me, and one of his friends joked that it was because he knew he didn't have a shot with \"the hot one\" - me. Kate asked if this was true, and Jamie having had WAY too much to drink, explained in a way that made it sound kind of true.\n\nHe said he did notice me that night and thought I was attractive, just seeing me. He said he would never have approached me because he knew he would never have a chance with someone like me, so in that way, his friend was right. He said that speaking to Kate was the absolute best outcome because he loves her and plans on spending the rest of his life with her, but even knowing this, Kate has taken this extremely hard, and even though she says she is over it, he's noticed changes in her behaviour that seem to be related to that. He also admitted that he'd been planning to propose to Kate at the party and that is why he'd wanted me to be there, but after hearing this on top of the way she has been handling the situation previously, he won't be doing that anymore.\n\nAfter speaking to Jamie, I called Kate. She admitted that she had tied a lot of her self worth in the fact that she'd finally been picked over me and now it felt like that wasn't true. She apologised for trying to solve her insecurities through me, but also said she wasn't sure she would be able to have me in her life as much as I had been with the way she's been feeling. As hurt as I was, I said I understood. She said she still wanted me to come to the party, since I'd helped organise it and she obviously dropped the absurd dress code, so I will be going to the party. I trust that Kate will communicate her boundaries to Jamie but I don't plan on inviting him to any more events for the foreseeable future.\n\nI'm really sad that I've probably lost a longtime friend over the drunken awkwardness of other people, but I also get that Kate can't help how she feels, and frankly it's for the best not to be in a secret competition. So, yeah, I'm hurt, but I'm going to the party. Not a satisfying update, but an honest one.\n\nUPDATE: going through these comments has actually brought up a couple of memories that have, in hindsight, made me a bit uncomfortable, and I actually don\u2019t think I will end up going to this party. As much as the mutual friends will have questions and I don\u2019t know how much of the truth I will end up telling, I feel too weird right now to continue to be involved in this situation.", "created_utc": 1679398517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xe70g/update_my_friend_asked_me_to_dress_badly_to_her/", "score": 1631, "replies": ["Jamie\u2019s friend was a real dick for putting him in that situation.

I hope Kate gets out of this relationship before it gets any more serious and you two can mend fences, but either way be glad he didn't think he had a shot with you and that you can just walk away from this while drama filled mess.", "This is heartbreaking for Kate. You did nothing wrong, and she obviously was out of line with what she asked of you, but I can\u2019t imagine hearing your partner say that would be an easy thing to get over, especially if she\u2019s insecure. She shouldn\u2019t have asked, he shouldn\u2019t have said what he did or exposed her to his friends if they have a history of not treating her well.

And it wasn\u2019t a \u201cyeah you\u2019re hot but I was also very attracted to Kate.\u201d It was a \u201cI know that you ARE (in present tense) out of my league so yeah that\u2019s why I am with your friend\u201d And to know they share a special bond over a shared hobby and do that together sometimes. And the fact that the SO can still admit that he felt friend was out of his league. If I were Kate I couldn\u2019t help but question if my partner still has a desire/attraction to friend, especially with how he worded things. But this isn\u2019t friends fault. This could be a wake up call that Jamie isn\u2019t the right person for Kate. It\u2019s human to feel insecure about something like this. It\u2019s something that I personally wouldn\u2019t want to live with. Maybe it would be seen as conservative but I personally wouldn\u2019t maintain a personal friend relationship with my friends boyfriend if this revelation came out. And if I were Kate I would probably not want to stay in a situation that made me feel insecure, unsure, and second best.", "Something I'm not getting here, why is he postponing the proposal? Is he doing it to give time to Kate to heal or because he'll reevaluate the relationship? For me it doesn't make much sense to pause his plans, not when Kate is like this, or maybe I'm dense, but... he loves her so much, right? What's the problem?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is so sad. On your first post, I was against Kate, but now that I learned all this new info I think Jamie is the absolute asshole of this story. He's exposing Kate to people who don't like her and now it has truly affected her self-worth. On top of that, he did practically confess to going after Kate as a second fiddle???? I would be destroyed if my partner said that to me, it doesn't matter if the outcome turned out to be \"the best\". I would need to reevaluate the relationship tbh. I truly wish for Kate to dump his ass and dish his friends.\n\nAnd, of course, she shouldn't have done what she did to you. You're completely innocent in this. It does sound like a good idea, for the moment, for her to step back from your friendship with her. Maybe that way she can start to think clearly and will try to mend things later on.\n\nI wish you both the best. And for Jamie to be dumped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: grammar", "I would just let it set a while, Kate seems to have some issues to work through and maybe that will be easier with you not there.\n\nIf it were me, and this is just my personal opinion, I'd tell her that she can take as much time as she needs and I'd be there if she needed me. \n\nShe may come back, she may not, but it may help lift some of the weight.", "Damn. Way to go, Jamie. Hope you lose half of ever sock pair and your beers are always lukewarm.", "If Jamie loves Kate he will be telling his \"friends\" who said that to her where to get off. \n\nNTA", "My sympathies are with Kate but it is doubtful that she can continue her relationship with Jamie.  It kind of reminds me of the play \"Reasons to Be Pretty,\" by Neil LaBute.  Bottom line is that once a woman thinks that her SO does not find her attractive, there is kind of no going back.  I hope Kate finds someone to talk through her problems with and I hope she leaves Jamie because on some level, she is never going to trust him.", "This is unfortunate for everyone involved, but I hope that in time your friendship with Kate will either mend or evolve into a deeper and more honest one, now that all cards are on the table. \n\nI wanted to add that this was so nicely written! A really competently structured and clear narrative - a pleasure to read!", "Ugh. \n\nHonestly, fight for your friend\n\nDeep down she knows it's not about you and Jamie is still with her bc she's her\n\nDon't let yourself become the proxy for her insecurities. She may not be there now, but the more you fight to be her friend, the more she'll see that you are a whole person - and so is she.", "You know, I read your original post and the update and you of course were right in the refusal to attend because of not wanting your outfit policed. I\u2019ve been asked to \u201ctone it down\u201d before myself and was equally outraged.\nWhile reading your original post I did have the brief thought of well clearly OPs friend feels insecure and OP could just see this as what it is, a friend saying \u201cyou\u2019re prettier than me and I just want to be the pretty one for once tonight\u201d.\nI\u2019ve been on both sides at different points in my life.\nYou aren\u2019t wrong or an AH but I guess there\u2019s always a choice that might not be the \u201cright\u201d one but it\u2019s the empathetic one. But that\u2019s a decision I would make now that I\u2019m 40, not necessarily when I was younger. \nI\u2019m the frumpy wife now and I do feel sometimes less than excited about meeting up with my husbands friends with their smoking hot younger girlfriends who are dressed fashionably.", "Having been Kate, the friend that guys would only talk to in order to talk to my pretty best friend or as a consolation prize, as sad as it is for you, distance is the only way she's going to be able to boost her self-esteem and start to acknowledge that she's stunning in her own light.\n\nSadly I'm not sure there's a future in her relationship with Jamie. His friends don't like her. His friends see her as second best to you and openly comment on this. Jamie admitted he only started talking to her as a consolation prize because he didn't feel like he'd have a shot with you. You two have things in common she doesn't share with him and after she told him you couldn't make it he called you up to make sure you could make it. None of these things are your fault to be clear. It's not your fault straight men are cruel & will openly be harsh to women they don't find attractive or see as less attractive than the one they like. But if Kate decides she'd prefer to wait for the man who came across the room to talk to her because she caught his eye, for a man who doesn't let his friends make her feel second best, for a man who doesn't share things with her prettier best friend, than that would be fair.\n\nI wish you all well going forwards. I have to say though, Jamie doesn't sound great in all this. And it doesn't sound convincing that he's not interested in you at all.", "So Jamie was going to propose to her, but now he's planning not to because he doesn't like how she's acted after HE wrecked her self esteem. What an asshole. Poor Kate", "Sad update. I do hope she gets some therapy because those feelings of inadequacy and distrust aren't going to disappear just because you're no longer there--she'll transfer them to new people. She really needs to address her issue now if she wants to eventually be able to have a happy life with him.\n\nAnd he needs to address his own issues. What a thing to say to someone you're supposed to love!", "As someone who was always looked over for their hot friend, I really feel bad for Kate. That kind of insecurity really fucks with your head.\n\nI hope she leaves Jamie and finds someone who won\u2019t hesitate to pick her first", "I think even aside from what was said that night, the fact that Katie had a confidence boost of someone \u201cpicking\u201d her over you is not healthy (her interpretation of events).\n\nThe way this all came out in the open was unfortunate, but I think that deep insecurity is unhealthy and would have reared its head at some point. I hope she knows that distancing herself from you is not going to solve all her problems. Unless she avoids hot people forever, she\u2019s going to have to work through her feelings of inadequacy.", "Why even go this party? You\u2019re literally going to spend the whole time in this sort of  mind fog of \u201cokay this is the last time I\u2019m allowed to be around these people\u201d or \u201cafter today these people will no longer be my friends or in my life\u201d \nWhy waste you time or possibly make more drama cuz you know those friends who said that will most likely be there", "Am I the only one who thinks Jamie was feeling out his chances with OP when he called her? \u201cI knew I would never have a chance with you, so I talked to her \u2026\u201d and he was going to propose but now isn\u2019t.  Feels like he was leaving that open in case OP would say he was wrong in thinking he had no chance.\n\nUltimately a sad update, I feel for both you and Kate.  I hope she moves on from the relationship and finds someone who treats her with the love and respect she deserves.\n\nI will say that I wouldn\u2019t be too thrilled about my friends forming separate close (hang out alone) relationships with my SO.", "Fuck, I feel for Kate. It's got to feel bad enough already to have a BFF who is universally viewed as \"The hot one\", but finding out that her boyfriend only ever talked to her in the first place because he knew he didn't stand a chance with the hot one? Ouch. Come on jamie, some secrets you take to your grave.", "Many people here are giving Kate a pass and blaming only Jamie. The thing is, she always h\u00e1s been in a competition with you OP. She literally said she tried her self worth because she was picked over you once in her life. This didn't started It with Jamie.That's really sad and toxic for a friendship. And maybe the fact Jamie \"picked\" her played a big part in their relationship. Yes, I think it's best for both of you have a break of each other but I really hope Kate work on her self-esteem issues.", "They both suck, and you're better off without the petty jealousy and drama.", "On the other hand, Jamie told you the truth and didn't try to make himself look good.", "Congratulations on being the hot one OP", "People are so terribly insecure.", "You dodged a bullet because when someone else turns his head that Kate is going to have problems.", "0 re", "I am happy you got resolution.  It's sad, but at least Jaime understands her insecurities and understands that he is making a decision. Having a spouse that separates you from your friends is a problem.  Ironically my Wife had no problem attending a wedding a few years after we met where my ex was in attendance but refused to spend time with another friend and his Wife, who was younger and frankly, better looking.  The latter effectively cut me off from that friend for over a decade until, frankly, she probably began to care less about ME and it became less of a problem.", "This sucks for you, I'm sorry. You did nothing wrong. Being attractive has advantages, but also clear disadvantages. I'm sorry a friendship has been lost/damaged.", "They say honesty is the best policy.....they also say truth hurts! Don't ask don't tell is also ANOTHER saying so pick your poison wisely", "I don't mean this as a dig, but Kate needs some therapy. She has some self esteem issues to the point where it effects her close friendships. This is stuff she can work out because that's gotta feel like shit for her.", "Maybe Kate needs to talk to a professional about this. I had the same issue until I got same help.", "What people mostly forget is that, while you may talk to someone first because they are attractive, you do not stay with someone because of how they look.\n\nLong term relationships are hard and take time.The reason why Jamie stayed with Kate has nothing to do with how attractive she is or not,but more how/who she was as a person. It is sad that women end up thinking early on that their value is based on how they look and that apparence is why your partner stays with you.\n\nIf you ended up being a better match, I am pretty sure Jamie would not have ended up with Kate.\n\nIf Jamie is a good person, it should matter less to him who looks best at what time.\n\nI think that reminding Kate that looks does not change her quality as an human being or the value of her relationship is a first step.\n\nJamie hopefully can find the right words to apologize. Life is not black and white, but showing kindness and empathy is a good step.", ">Kate has hopefully learned the lesson that you shouldn't ask a question if you don't want to know the answer. I\n\nUnfortunately all it takes is knowing that the question exists, and it will devour you. With insecurities, they eat you alive if you can't get on top of them.", "Well, at least Kate's fashion advice wasn't as bad as Jamie's life advice.", "Jamie did nothing wrong. Kate asked a stupid ass question and she got the honest answer. Fuck around and you\u2019ll find out. Kate has massive insecurities with tying her self worth to competing with OP in a very unhealthy way and it\u2019s not on Jamie to unpack and fix that. If anything I feel bad for Jamie because the implication behind all this is that Kate only picked him because she felt superior to OP for once in this super sick and unhealthy way that her mind thinks. She\u2019s extremely toxic and is likely going to hurt Jamie a lot more in the future when she goes to therapy and realizes she didn\u2019t pick him for him but rather because he served a delusional affirmation of her major insecurity. I don\u2019t feel sorry for her in the least because all of her problems are her own fault and she\u2019s hurt others because of them. Zero sympathy for people like her.", "I really don't think he meant it like that. \n\nThe fact is, he didn't actually come over to talk to either of us. His boss was one of the guys he was out with that night, and his boss came over to hit on me, and brought Jamie as his wingman. Jamie never wanted to talk to me in the first place, but because his boss did, he got chatting to Kate.\n\nAnd I really believe he loves her. You can see that he loves her. They just fit. It's sad to think that could be ruined because of him seeing me from 10ft away several years ago (and also because of his friend's unbelievable stupidity).", "It\u2019s not something you should say AT ALL, whether your partner is there or not.", "He said he's postponing the proposal because neither Kate nor the relationship are in the right place for it atm. I understand it to be that the relationship doesn't feel as stable, and no matter how much you love someone you don't want a proposal with unsaid things hanging over you.\n\nI don't believe he ever thought of Kate as second fiddle. He saw me across a room and thought I was pretty, knowing nothing about me. That happens daily in the world. You don't talk to every person you find attractive. It wasn't like he tried it on with me and I said no so he settled for Kate. He didn't, and never would have, tried hitting on me. Apart from noting that I was \"out of his league\" I was totally irrelevant.\n\nBut yeah, the whole thing is disappointing.", "Jamie could\u2019ve saved that situation easily if he\u2019d had two brain cells to rub together.", "I agree with this!  And I\u2019m glad OP seems to be handling it gracefully since that means reconciliation with Kate will still be on the table if Kate ever desires it.", "Yeah i find it off that Jamie contacts her separately like that.", "I don't think he's doing that. I'm married, he for sure has no chance now and he 1000% wouldn't have had one then either. Not that I think he would have wanted it, despite sharing an interest in one sport Jamie and I are pretty different, we definitely have different views on relationships, gender roles, other important things. All of those important things him and Kate share.", "I was about to say that there was a post a bit back where a bride had asked their sister/stepsister to not be a bride\u2019s maid, because the sister was undeniably attractive, and the bride was threatened about being upstaged. It\u2019s the exact situation, except reversed here and that OP was deemed TA. \n\nI would also agree that this OP here has a better chance of moving on from this friendship. It was doomed from that moment on, despite none of it being OP\u2019s fault :/ It simply happens. You find better friends than that.", "That's not a \"truth\" you tell your partner who you claim to love and intend to marry. Jamie is an idiot.", "Yeah, it's working out real well for me lol. /s", "Come on. Jaimie was stupid for saying it the way he did. But him thinking OP was more attractive years ago so talking to Katie isn't him getting his head turned.", "It\u2019s utterly tragic that she \u201ctied a lot of her self worth into finally being picked over [OP.]\u201d I mean, she\u2019s planning to marry Jamie! Does she really think he\u2019s with her because he actually thinks she\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world? Does she live in fear he might meet a beautiful celebrity one day and just drop her like nothing? \n\nObviously attraction is important in a relationship, but there has to be SO MUCH more there for it to last. Basically no one ends up with the most physically attractive person they\u2019ve ever seen in their lives, and that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re settling. It just means there\u2019s more to beauty than looks.", "I don't believe that it would be ruined because of that one night many years ago, but because of his actions now. The way he said it, it seems like Kate still is the safe choice, someone he settled for even though he wanted you. That must be absolutely heartbreaking for her, knowing that the person you love feels like this. I'm honestly so sad for her, and hope she can find happiness without him.", "It\u2019s not just that night that ruined things.

She may not have revealed just how fearful she was of this exact scenario playing out. The current mess is the result of a convergence of factors that didn\u2019t all originate with Jamie.

Jamie did saw Kate as a second fiddle. That's plain awful.", "Yeah, like he couldve just said \"but i spoke to the hot one\", \"sure OP was hot/pretty but isnt my type\" or smth like that, and this problem wouldnt have ever happened. Technically its not even a lie since he speaked to both his gf and OP (like theres no way you gonna flirt with one friend and not talk at least a little with the other), which he admitted was the hottest one so... \n\nJamie should learn to control his mouth when theres alcohol involved tho", "\"What are you talking about? I clearly asked out the hot one, she's sitting right there\" like come on Jamie this isn't too complicated", "He could still subconsciously be thinking that maybe your marriage isn\u2019t  happy, maybe you\u2019re open to the idea of something more.

So much. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone whose husband did (or says he did anyway haha) see them across the room and have a \"I have to meet her\" moment. I love that for him, but he's not the only man who's seen me across the room and wanted to talk to me, but I didn't end up with any of them because lasting relationships go so far beyond that.

I DID get with the hot one.\".", "I don't know how to explain it but I kind of feel that for me \"out of my league\" and \"not relationship material by my standards\" are surprisingly often overlapping. For example, Jason Momoa is truly hot and out of my league but at the same time, if somehow he would be interested in me (while being hit in the head with a heavy object and making real weird decisions?), I don't think I would see him as an actual potential life partner because our preferred lifestyles would be too different. The same with all the hot guys who hit the gym 6 days per week and mainly eat rice and chicken - really hot to look at, definitely out of my league and I definitely wouldn't be interested in it either, give me my daily pastry and let me sleep in. So I kind of understand where Jamie might have been coming from.", "Maybe I look at it the way I do because I liken it to the way I met my husband. I didn't walk into the room the night I met him and immediately notice that he was the most attractive person I've ever seen, but the moment we spoke we clicked, and it never entered my mind that it would matter that he wasn't the best looking in the room. I just don't consider seeing someone from 10ft away and thinking they're hot that much of a big deal because it doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBut then, I think maybe I'm looking at it wrong because the physical aspect is more of a thing for men. I don't know. I'm still trying to work it out in my head I guess.", "As I said in the post, I won't be inviting him to things in future. Even if Kate and I can't be friends like we used to be, I still feel out of respect for her I'm not going to invite Jamie places because I know it's making her feel bad. And I'm sure she will tell him this as well.", "I mean that\u2019s assuming his girlfriend wouldn\u2019t have run off with that tangent no matter what he said. She was already blaming/ taking it out on OP unreasonably. Who\u2019s to say the question wasn\u2019t enough to trigger her. Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re gonna say, a person is going to believe what they want. As she was already doing with OP.", "Well, I failed that test then, absolutely didn't refute that statement.

And it was your husband's best friend who caught your eye and made you go, WOW. And not just you but all the women in the room. So y'all went over to talk the friend but you lost your nerve because he was that attractive and ended up in conversation with your husband, who you clicked with. And in dating your husband you found out that every woman used him as a stepping stone to chat to the best friend, and your husband had insecurity about it.

That must have been so traumatic to hear, that her relationship began as him entertaining \"the less attractive one.\"\n\nThank you for posting an update, this one was weighing heavy on me, that the vast majority of commenters just could not even try to have empathy for Kate, who it seemed clear to me was dealing with a lot of insecurity in the sanctity of her relationship.\n\nI dealt with a situation where my partner was getting too close for comfort with one of my good friends, and was acting differently than with other female friends. I never put that burden of info on her, because I felt like it wasn't fair to do so, nor was it her fault, but I did ask them both to respect certain boundaries of not texting/communicating 1 on 1, and to not make plans without me, but ultimately I did have to lose that friendship. So your story hit close to home for me.\n\nHopefully she and Jamie can work on strengthening their relationship and trust enough for Kate to feel comfortable with you in her life again, but as I think you know, your separate friendship with Jamie needs to be left behind to have any chance of that. \n\nLastly, I'm sorry for you too. It's not your fault that he made that cruel comment right in front of Kate. It must suck to lose friends because their partners feel the need to make comments on your appearance.", "After reading the original post and the update, I feel really bad for Kate and I hope she leaves that idiot Jamie out of her life.

These friends and himself (no matter how much alcohol was involved) said things that would hurt her or any human being.  Also, it was not drunken awkwardness, it was a mean-spirited dressing down. \n\nI think you are minimising her valid feelings, which she managed fine with before it was rammed in her face. I can see a clear thought path to this pain as can many on this thread. She is the one experiencing pain, you are not.\n\nI wouldn't be going as I wouldn't wanna spend time with bullies. And I certainly wouldn't be wearing a dress to highlight their point and make my friend feel worse. \n\nI hate bullies but showing up for someone isn't just shouting someone down, it is about putting their needs before yours sometimes.\n\nIt is your choice, but remember beauty fades a good heart doesn't.", "This story is really sad and Jamie sounds like a complete asshole.

One thing I love about being closer to 40 than 30 now is that, yeah, I do feel some small (very small) twinge of jealousy when I notice a woman I find so much more attractive/fit/smarter/more accomplished than me. But now I'm in a place where I can quickly turn my thinking around and say, I'm me, not her so there is no comparison here. \n\nIf I want to improve myself, I can work on myself, looking at other women and being jealous of what they have/what they've worked hard to accomplish does me a disservice. They are living their lives and I am living mine. If I'm unhappy with what I've got, I gotta focus on me, not other girls and what they've got. \n\nI also make it a point to try and think something positive when I see someone and if I do have something nice to say, I try to tell them out loud (if possible) just to spread positivity (like \"I love your shoes!\" or \"that jacket is stunning\"). It's just so much more satisfying to get a compliment from a woman rather than a man (with the male gaze thing, it doesn't feel as genuine).

All these other instances of her feeling jealous or resenting me came out, and it strained our friendship. We both had to take a step back. Eventually we hung out again, but to be honest, our friendship was never the same. I felt like I had to be a more muted version of myself, and she started getting crushes on guys in my orbit (guys in my classes, or that I'd known first) and accuse me of flirting...It became exhausting, and unhealthy for both of us.\n\nThe funny thing is, my mom always told me she was jealous and to be careful, but I didn't listen. We're about the same level of attractiveness and she always dated more than me.\n\nOP, I hope that you and Katie can salvage your friendship, but you may not. You're doing the right thing by giving her space, but make sure you use this time to reevaluate your friendship from your standpoint.

I can only live the life I want and accept that a good chunk of it has become of something I have very little control over.\n\nBut yes, I agree that being considered attractive has probably shaped my perception of a lot of things, and perhaps desensitised me to how important it can be for some people that other people consider them physically attractive.", "You\u2019re 1000% right that it wasn\u2019t just that night that ruined things.

Most people I know find their partner really really atractive, and especially after knowing them can't imagine someone more beautifull.

Yeah it's great they ended up falling in love but to hear \"well I picked you cause I didn't think I had a chance with your friend\" can really fuck with someone.

No one should have to feel like a second choice to their partner.", "You're exactly right.

It's because he's not richer.", "A lot of attractive people genuinely don't understand how differently they are treated. One of my attractive friends really had no idea that her male friends actually wanted to be with her because it just seemed like that's how guys act.\n\nFrom comments OP sounds like she is taking the distance from the bf, and respects the needs of her friend, while still struggling to come to terms with it all. It would be a bit creepy hearing you were being talked about that way, and Kate is understandably more affected by how she was treated than thinking about how gross these dudes were acting towards her friend.", "I already said what Jamie said was shitty, and what his friends said is shitty. I've met them multiple times, they're kind of shitty people in general, I'm just not surprised one of them pulled that kind of crap, frankly.\n\nAnd no, Jamie and I would not have hit it off. I was dating my now-husband at the time, and even if it I wasn't, never in a million years would I have hit it off with Jamie, I don't like him like that, we are very different people, we do not vibe on that level.\n\nI am absolutely sad for Kate that this is how things played out, and I'm sad that years of friendship has to go down the drain over Jamie because my God is he not worth it.\n\nBut, I have realised over the course of this whole incident that Jamie is not the beginning and end of the issues between me and Kate. Her self esteem being partially dependent on \"winning\" over me in a competition I didn't know we were in isn't the way you think about a friend, and it was *never* how I thought about her. And for her to try to embarrass me, or pull me up for some imagined slight based on something that never had anything to do with me in the first place isn't being a good friend either. And I would have worked on it, honestly I would have, because I love her, but she doesn't want to, which is fine, but I won't be pretending she was in the right for how she's handled this in regard to me because she isn't.", "Kate asked her best friend to not dress up to a party to not caught her man's attention.

I trust that Kate will communicate her boundaries to Jamie but **I don't plan on inviting him to any more events for the foreseeable future.**\n\nI don't think OP is being unreasonable going to a party she helped plan, and she's setting very firm boundaries with Jamie.

If some random person did this to me/you instead of a long time friend like Kate, then there's no point in debating ditch them all. \n\n\nBUT, most of my response is based on how I would handle this situation if it were my long time friend and her shitty fiance. Hell I'll even apologise because for staters it'll make Kate feel better, then when she works herself out she will realise how you were not in the wrong. I would tell my friend that I'll take a step back from her relationship and her so she has the time and space to heal and understand how to deal with her insecurities. \n\n\nAnd you and Jamie hitting it off was a hypothetical imagine, a scenario where someone starts talking because one thinks the other is attractive and then they hit it off.\n\n\nYou're in a healthy relationship and in a good place mentally so it's not a wrong thing to be supportive of Kate even though she didn't treat you right. That's what I would do. Although I don't know if I'll jump back in with Kate whenever she's ready in the future. Maybe a permanent step back could be a good thing for all of you without balming kate for how she handled her insecurity.\n\n\nETA: why even go this party? You can't possibly think all 3 you will have good time there along with Jamie's shitty friends?", "Kate is the reason your friendship with Kate is going down on a drain, and I'm glad you are seeing that.

Kate has a lot of work to do on herself.", "Okay, but my point still stands - clearly Jamie isn\u2019t mature enough for marriage either.", "If she has lost her friend then why go?", "I dont disagree that the friendship isnt healthy at all and Kate is definitely to blame for the secret competition thing. But OP has made a lot of comments about how *she* wouldn't have taken offense like Kate did and so Kate is over reacting and how \"Jamie didn't mean it *like that*\". It comes off as very Jamie apologist and trying to make Kate the villain in some way, so I have my doubts that OPs a very good friend herself and perhaps even played into the issue here.", "And it\u2019s things like that that are why Kate is struggling. Because Jamie is looking for openings and you aren\u2019t like SHES MY BEST FRIEND HOW DARE YOU", "Do Jamie and Kate both know that?

Given her long history of being outshined in your presence, her insecurity her is completely understandable, especially in light of HIS behavior around you.\n\nSo, IMO, ESH. Kate, for not dealing with her insecurity in a mature manner and putting blame for her doubts on you. This sucks, but is both understandable and forgivable. Jamie, for not having her back when his friends insult her, for agreeing with his jerk friend about her second-class status compared to you, and for feeding her insecurity by spending so much time with you without her. And You, OP, for putting yourself and your pride ahead of her feelings because simply toning down your look for one night so your friend can make a strong impression on his family and so she can feel good about herself in your presence is just too much to ask, apparently.", "But at the end of the day, he picked the worst things to say.

You dont know for certain that she would have taken it badly, but he went with probably the worst possible option short of \"you looked easy\" which was inferred anyway. Ofcourse shes going to react badly to that, he could have said way better things and if she still blew up then it would be on her", "Before you dig yourself into too deep of a hole, she said she\u2019s struggled with this even as a teen, meaning the surgery isn\u2019t what made her \u201cthe hot one\u201d.

It's not about having a cross to bear so much as not thinking it's fair to be made to feel like the way I look is an inconvenience to the people around me, which is how I felt through this whole thing.\n\nNo one has to feel sorry for me for the way I look and as much as I feel bad for Kate that Jamie and his friends did a dick-ish thing, I don't feel sorry for how she looks either. I feel bad that a years long friendship has been ruined over something as petty as looks.", "Because why should she? It\u2019s a ridiculous request.", "He\u2019s even more of an idiot for having said anything along those lines to his friends, who don\u2019t like Kate. Did he really think they wouldn\u2019t use it against her?", "Correct, but as I said, look at things from *Kate\u2019s* perspective. How would she know that Jamie wanted OP there so he could propose? She couldn\u2019t. All she saw was Jamie begging for OP to attend his birthday party, and with all the other info she had, that\u2019s definitely going to breed insecurity in most people. Jealousy is a human emotion, and as much as it would be nice to tell her to get over it, I see why she felt the way she did.", "And now that Kate has had a (honestly reasonable, if the handling was poor) issue with OP, he\u2019s not proposing. So her instinct might not even be wrong", "They saw the goods on full display.", "Yeah I was about to say like there's a reason Olivia dunne is the highest paid college athlete and it has like 7 percent to do with her ability... It is what it is", "They certainly won't get married when she finds out\n\n1. he was going to propose\n2. after he found out about GF's request, he decided not to\n3. OP knew about the decision not to propose first", "No, and Kate is going to blame OP when they break up, \"Nothing was the same after the situation with Jamie's birthday party.\"", "I mean I'm not super pretty and watch too many pretty people not have meaningful happy relationships because they're hot. There's a million other things to love in a person other than appearances.", "I wish I could believe that too! It's been 3 years and she still wants OP to dress down around her boyfriend so she appears hotter. Clearly she still believes that the boyfriend would find OP more attractive. Yes, Jamie screwed up by admitting it and saying what he said. But he must know something is off with the relationship too because he decided not to propose after the way she reacted. There's a lot we don't know about that relationship, I'm sure OP doesn't know it all either! Hopefully they are truly happy and this is just a little bump in the relationship. Guess we'll never know", "Especially when he still goes to events with the now-married \u201chot one\u201d. Jamie needed to have a much more selective memory about that first meeting.\n\nBut it seems like insecure Kate wanted to prove a point to Jamie\u2019s friends, by being the \u201chot one\u201d at that party.", "It makes me wonder how much of their friendship has consisted of OP shining while Kate was relegated to the shadows. Not saying it's OP's fault, or that she's going out of her way to make her friend feel small. Sometimes that just happens, and Kate's growing insecurity and need to outshine her has essentially ruined their friendship. It's really too bad, and Kate's going to need to do a lot of work to get her head on straight.", "That\u2019s cool to grow. But hurting others in the process is something I don\u2019t respect.", "One instance of someone letting their friends publicly humiliate me is enough for me. What they said was cruel and he did nothing besides passively agree with them.", "Well never, and if he did that would be a really shitty thing to say. Undoubtedly Jamie was AH to say that or let that conversation go on.\n\nI just wonder if I would let that negate the actual important things in my relationship, which is absolutely not how hot my husband thought I was in the first minute of seeing me. \n\nThat's all, it was just a thought. Not a definitive judgement on Kate's thought process, which she is totally entitled to.", "Her being married doesn't necessarily inform boyfriend's feelings about her though.  Like, it may not be about something happening, but about the way he looks at her.", "Yep. Been married for nearly two years. I was dating my now husband when we met Jamie.", "This is super weird, because I've literally only been putting the pieces together in the last few hours since this all happened. But yeah, looking back on it, Jamie has always teased me (in group situations, not over text or in any inappropriate way) about dating successful men (this is a running joke amongst my friends hence how he knows about it). He's also said a lot of things in the vein of \"if you're a guy it's not about looks, it's about money\". \n\nOMG. It's all coming back to me now. One time him and Kate were out with me and my husband and Kate and I were in the loo, and my husband and Jamie were talking about cars and he mentioned my new car and (jokingly) how he spoils me and Jamie said something like \"well yeah, girls like her, you have to, don't you\". And me and my husband laughed about it at the time because we thought it was him making a dig at me but looking back on it, now I'm like...\n\nUgh, this is getting gross.", "Yeah.", "OP said in another comment that she would exclude him from any future activities with Kate.", "I'm not in competition with anyone. And that's not because I'm the most attractive person on earth, in fact it has nothing to do with looks. I'm *happy*. I'm not looking around at what other people have or what I can take from them because I don't want it. And I don't tend to keep people in my life who want the things I have either. I never saw Kate as being like that, but this has made me rethink a lot.\n\nI'm just not a competitive person, I never have been.", "Kate and I have a lot of mutual friend who will be at this party, and who I figure Kate doesn't want to tell the truth of why I wouldn't be going.", "We have a lot of mutual friends who will be at the party. Honestly I think a lot of the reason Kate still wants me to come is because she will not want to explain to our mutual friends why I'm not there.", "That might be Kate's or Jamie's perception of reality, but it's factually incorrect. And if Jamie had ever let on that he had a fleeting thought that he might have had a chance with me I'd have absolutely lost it on him.", "I mean while what he said wasn\u2019t ideal, it for sure wasn\u2019t the worst. I agree with you we don\u2019t know how she would have acted, but her trying to make demands to OP and shifting the blame to her isn\u2019t exactly reasonable. So there\u2019s also a chance, no matter what he said, she wouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. Especially since she had already tied her self worth to \u201cfinally being chosen first\u201d.", "Right, so instead of talking to her boyfriend about it and how his friends were acting, she took it out on OP. So not really, she was treating OP differently because she couldn\u2019t face her own insecurities or communicate to her bf that she was hurt. She didn\u2019t communicate to OP either, just made unreasonable demands.", "I mean I agree with the assumption bit. I am sort of assuming the question set her off and his words pushed her and the people I\u2019m responding to are assuming he could have fixed the situation with magic words. We don\u2019t know for sure, but I agree his words didn\u2019t help. And I don\u2019t blame her for reacting badly to them, but I do blame her for shifting it and attacker her friend instead of having a conversation with him about it.", "A boob job and nose job likely did make her \u201chotter\u201d\n\nBut overall I\u2019m just sad for both Kate and OP (not Jamie, he sucks.)\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry OP feels her husband wouldn\u2019t be with her if she didn\u2019t look the way she did.", "Man I really don\u2019t understand why Kate is feeling even a little bit insecure. Plastic surgery is an option anyone could take if they care enough to spend the insane amounts of money and health risks of surgeries\u2026 she clearly doesn\u2019t, so why waste time feeling lesser than someone who chose to pay for it?\n\nShe needs to drop Jaime, he sounds fucking awful. I also wonder if you enjoy his \u201cfriendship\u201d because you like the attention he gives you\n\nThis whole thing makes me feel so sad for Kate", "This would definitely affect many relationships. Even if you are the closest couple to ever exist, a comment like that can drive the tiniest wedge in your heart. If it doesn\u2019t affect the person in that instant, it\u2019s still possible to linger and be the first brick laid for other events to eventually pile on.", "Yeah I don't think you get it. At all. This isn't about, \"one time this guy Jamnie didn't think I was the hottest guy in the room.\" I guarantee that this has been a recurring thing. You and Kate go out to places and you get way more attention. All the guys want to talk to you. It has probably eaten away at her self-esteem for a long time. But she can't bring that up to you because it's not your fault.\n\nOne time you go out together and then there's this amazing guy. And guess what: He picks Kate! Not OP, like most of the other guys do. He sees Kate differently than most.\n\nExcept you eventually find out that, no, he didn't \"pick\" her. He didn't approach her because she was the one that intrigued him or made him nervous or excited. He settled for her. She thought for just one night in her life SHE was the one a guy saw as \"The Catch\" of you two.\n\nYes, they've obviously built a great relationship since then, looks aren't everything, and he'd pick her over you 1 million times out of 1 million at this point. \n\nBut that's not getting at the root of it. You sound like a really amazing friend who handled this entire situation with dignity and compassion, but based on the dynamics here I'm not sure you understand what she must have been feeling like for all of these years. You do not know what it's like to be \"the ugly friend.\" And so if your current husband didn't happen to think you were the hottest person in the world at the first moment he met you, it's fine, because you're not used to ALWAYS being the consolation prize.", "No offense but you seem like you don\u2019t have a lot of empathy and enjoy being \u201cthe hot one\u201d more than you care about Kate\u2019s reasonable feelings and how awful her boyfriend is being in response to those feelings.", "It's best if you stop engaging lol the more you say things the more it shows how you're belittling Kate at the end because she refuses to accept and approve that the whole world thinks you're the most attractive.", "Your lack of empathy for Kate is astounding (and its diagusting how you keep trying to blame her somehow in this scenario), I hope for her sake you two don't become friends again.", "Ill be real op, i think hes jelous he cant have you. Thats what I see personally, not to put things in your head but. If you turned around and said I want to an affair with jamie, it sounds like hed do it. I dont trust him at all, seems to weird about you honestly. \n\nIm not saying he doesnt care for Kate, but definately seems like he wanted and still wants you and is jelous that your husband has you, so hes basically saying that all you care about is money not the man, or youd be with him.\n\nI may be over reaching abit, but thats what im seeing here anyway.", "I mean yeah this really confirms that he did, in fact, see Kate as a consolation prize. And *continues* to view her as second-best to this day. \n\nThe way she chose to make his shitty behavior your problem was undeserved, but damn, she is absolutely correct about her boyfriend\u2019s feelings. If he\u2019d felt like he could \u201cafford\u201d you, he absolutely would\u2019ve pursued you instead of her that night.", "following your recent understanding of his intentions, do you feel like his friendship with you has been misguided as he hopes to someday be with you? from reading all of this, it seems like hes with kate out of convenience. you dont treat the girl you plan to marry and claim to love like this.", "I meant OP is still going to this party that started everything which is Jamie's birthday party.", "You can't just say you have some unavoidable work? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "I mean you can be \u201csick\u201d, no?", "Why can\u2019t you just graciously not go? Why does any of this need explaining to anyone not involved? Why can\u2019t you just remove yourself gracefully and let them work it out? It sounds like you are determined to make this about you.", "Sounds like one of those situations where because you are happily married and secure in yourself, your life and your marriage, there's a chance you missed that Jamie was being dodgy because that's not how you think or act. We're strangers so we don't know better than you, you're in the situation and know these people. But the way Jaimie has been insisting on your presence at the party proposal or no proposal, the way he didn't cut off your hang outs when he learned about Kate's insecurity, the way he didn't shut down his friends treatment of Kate and the way he still sees you as 'out of his league' instead of as a friend ... to strangers it sounds like there's a possibility Kate's insecurity spiralled to where it did because deep down she's aware that if you were to express interest in Jamie, he would jump. And even if it's not true, Jamie's a dog for making the woman he planned to marry feel that way.", "Id say that him saying, essentially \"yeah you were my second choice, OP was out of my league\" is pretty much as  bad as it gets, especially for kate \n\nIts like saying.. \"i chose you because you arent as pretty as your sister\", yknow?", "I mean\u2026.. not really? Look at literally every female celebrity ever. They were hot before and they\u2019re hot now\u2026 honestly I\u2019d argue most looked better without the surgery. Its definitely not accurate to say \u2018hotter\u2019 more likely it\u2019s just \u2018different\u2019. It\u2019s all about self perception sometimes. \n\nAnd yeah, but also, if she looked how she did but was a horrid person, she wouldn\u2019t be with him either, so it isn\u2019t just looks. Attraction is important, but it\u2019s not everything. I\u2019m sure she knows that. It\u2019s different if she thought that\u2019s the only reason her husband is with her of course.", "Because a lot of people want to be wanted without having to pay insane amounts of money for surgeries, not to mention take the health risks of such surgeries. Insecurity isn't fixed by the surgery anyway because then it's, \"would they be with me if I didn't have the surgery?\" If the answer is no, then, \"do they really love *me* or just what I look like?\"", "Well I didn't know him for the decade I was friends with her before we met him so....", "I'm not OP, but I'd have empathy for Kate and her reasonable feelings up to the point she started her shitty, UNreasonable response to them. Jamie said something shitty, yes. Her feelings were hurt yes. I feel bad for her at that point, yes. But the way she processed and reacted to those feelings is where I lose my *sympathy* for her. She took her feelings out on OP, who was innocent in all this, and in a shitty, malicious way. OP tried to bow out gracefully and Kate demanded OP stay and let her *punish* OP for something she had nothing to do with. *I* am pissed at Kate for this, and I'm just reading about it secondhand. So I think OP is excused for not being empathetic toward Kate now.", "Kate is a horrible friend anyways to treat OP the way she did because of her insecurities. Lots of ppl see someone   Differently based on how the look but then they get to know them and feelings change.", "Oh right sorry.", "Would be suspicious considering I don't work lol. But also, they've been aware of this issue with the dress code, so they would think it was because of something related to that and I know they've all kind of started to turn on her about that also.", "I could. Tbh going through these comments a lot of things are coming back to me now that are seriously grossing me out and I don't think I will end up going to this party.", "Exactly. It sounds like OP likes being the centre of attention. Honestly, it sounds like kate and jamu are going to have a lot more trouble, and by going you are inserting yourself in the middle of it all...", "So that\u2019s why I agreed that it wasn\u2019t ideal, because he did admit he thought OP was pretty and though she was out of his league. But then he also said that talking to Kate was the best thing that happened to him and that he loved her. So yes, he was drunk and explained it badly. But he also said that he loved her and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. And then she took all that information and came up with \u201cI need to make sure OP looks ugly so a guy that loves me and plans on proposing to me won\u2019t get with her\u201d. It was always about her own insecurities.", "That\u2019s even weirder bro- I can\u2019t imagine asking out a friend\u2019s boyfriend (who I met THROUGH HER) to spend one on one time together\n\nI actually can\u2019t imagine a single one of my female friends ever doing that because not a single one ever would", "How do they know about the dress code thing? Did you tell them?", "wow. go to that party stir up some more drama (it's inevitable atp). Hoping that will be Kate's wake up call to realise her self worth and that she deserves better friends and boyfriend.", "Sorry,  but after the bomb he dropped, \"but i swear i love you\"! Isnt gonna cut it. \n\nKate reacted badly, but shes apologized to OP so i dont see anything wrong there. But theres no way that any normal person wouldnt be insecure after a revelation like that. It would take a *long* time to get over, if it was even possible.", "Sounds like Jamie spills everything. I\u2019m betting it\u2019s him.", "Then that\u2019s something she should have talked to her BF about. Not something she should attack OP over. And I never said she shouldn\u2019t be insecure over what her bf said. Any \u201cnormal person\u201d would talk to their SO about how their words hurt them. Not make demands and shift the blame to her friend. And also an apology of \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I did, but I have to cut you off\u201d is not really a normal apology. Kate inserted OP into drama between her and her bf, and then cut her off completely."]}
