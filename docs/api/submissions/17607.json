Since the accident, my mother's closest friend Diana has been an issue for my fiancee and I. It started in the hospital when she was my nurse but couldn't get herself together. Every time she would come by she would go on and on about how I ruined my life like her first husband did. She would also go off about how I should have gone to college like her son and my brother who are now third-year University students. On the third day of this, my fiancee and I had her swapped out before cutting off contact for the time being.\r  \n\r  \nThat solved things until this month when her antics started up again during a gathering and after a gathering, she wasn't invited to. This time it was with two new additions with the first being that she wanted me to sell my pickup truck and tools. The second was she wanted me to attend her \"coaching\" groups and enroll in a college program. At first, I politely told her I had no interest but she couldn't take the hint. After receiving several text messages and unannounced visits I simply told her to fuck off and that she has no say in my choices. Since I had evidence of her misusing her position as a nurse I made a formal complaint against her. his led to her becoming very upset with me even more so when she got a formal notice of investigation. Both she and my mother think I am being a huge asshole and shouldn't have done what I did.\r  \n\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684439567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l8zb5/aita_for_telling_someone_they_have_no_say_and/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You tried doing it nicely, and she decided to persist - actions have consequences.

Busy bodies like this need to be taught a lesson. She sounds miserable.", "NTA\n\nAlso write down dates, times of all contact from her. File a restraining order.", "NTA.  She was promoting (or preparing to promote) her side hustle on the clock.  It's unprofessional, especially for a nurse in a hospital setting.  She should learn from this.

Firstly, what was all that wailing about? *she would go on and on about how I ruined my life like her first husband did.* You didn't purposely lose your hand in this work accident. She isn't your mom. So why is she acting so weird. And then harassing you *to sell my pickup truck and tools. The second was she wanted me to attend her \"coaching\" groups and enroll in a college program.* You are an independent adult & have a fianc\u00e9e for back up.

If so she's even more predatory and definitely needs stopped.", "NTA. She was extremely unprofessional. As your caregiver, she gave speeches about \"how you ruined your life\" while you were recovering, I'm speechless. Hope the investigation teaches her to keep her mouth shut and her nose out of other people's bussinesses.", "NTA. And it\u2019s very concerning that your mom didn\u2019t stick up for you. In fact, I kind of have to wonder if your mom sends Diane to do her dirty work for her? Like maybe Diane\u2019s complaints are your moms? super fucked up. I\u2019m sorry about your hand and I hope you are recovering.", "NTA First i'm sorry about what you experienced. As if it isn't awful enough to have such an accident with such consequences, no, the nurse who should care for you and is also your mothers friend, causes you so much stress.
