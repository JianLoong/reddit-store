Anya really loves cats but I had been very reluctant to get her one as I didn\u2019t think she was responsible enough. But she shown she was responsible by volunteering at shelters and taking care of neighbors cats.\n\nSo I got her one from the shelter. A month after she has had the cat I felt like most of the cat\u2019s things were being thrown on me. The cat is still very well taken care of but not even by the owner which is Anya. She wouldn\u2019t even forget to do something but just be so LAZY and insists that I feed the cat, clean the litter, give the cat water, give the cat a treat. Every single day she would ask me to do something for her cat because she would be too lazy to do so.\n\nShe didn\u2019t even have other things to do but just chose not to do it. If I don\u2019t do it after her insisting a million times then she would get up to do it but half ass it and just complain about how she has to \u201cdo everything\u201d for HER pet.\n\nTwo months ago I told Anya if she doesn\u2019t start being on top of her cat duties then I would be giving the cat to someone else. During the entire two months absolutely nothing changed. It seemed she got more lazy towards the cat. Not to mention during the two months she legit wasn\u2019t able Ben paying attention to the cat.\n\nSo I did exactly what I said I would be doing. Because it seemed to me she wasn\u2019t ready for a full commitment and was just hoping for the fun part. And after a month she got bored of this new responsibility. \n\nShe was extremely upset and said she was going to start caring for her pet the day I gave it away. I told her that she should\u2019ve been caring for the pet since day one.

A cat isn't something that can just be neglected and ignored. Good parenting.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her the chance, and she chose to half ass it or didn't do anything at all making you handle taking care of her pet. You gave her two months to shape up and be a responsible pet owner, and she chose not to do anything.\n\nIt's sad that the cat had to be moved to a new home, as rehoming can lead to issues with the cat itself.

A cat isn\u2019t a toy you can put away until you\u2019re in the mood. It\u2019s a living being that requires care.

You got your minor daughter a cat, meaning YOU signed the paperwork at the shelter, and YOU are responsible for the cat (\u2026and your child)\n\nHowever, it isn\u2019t cool that your daughter isn\u2019t taking care of her cat. You also gave her a two month warning, which is more than enough to change her behavior, before giving the cat away. \n\nUltimately, it sucks. That\u2019s more stress for the cat to be rehomed again, but if you can\u2019t take care of the cat then it is ultimately for the best. \n\nSide note tho, maybe I\u2019ll be called cruel, but I would\u2019ve treated Anya the way she treats the cat. I would\u2019ve made dinner for myself, but not Anya. I would have cleaned my space, but not Anya\u2019s. I would\u2019ve done my laundry, but not hers.

The cat needed an owner willing to look after her", "NTA", "YTA not for giving up the cat since she is not taking care of it properly but because you got it in the first place when she is 16 and will be going off to college in two years. She can\u2019t take it on campus so you would have had to take care of it anyway or given it away since you didn\u2019t want it anyway. \n\nMy philosophy is that if you have kids, no matter what age they are, you should be mentally prepared to take care of that pet more than the child. If you know that you don\u2019t want to take on that responsibility or don\u2019t like pets in general than DON\u2019T get one. It\u2019s good for a child to learn responsibility in taking care of a pet but they will leave the house for college and the burden will fall on you anyway", "Where is the cat?!", "Of course you're NTA.  This is the softest of FAFO.", "NTA. i absolutely adore my cats and always make sure they\u2019re taken care of even between mental health, life, + two jobs. if you can\u2019t take care of an animal, they deserve better, period. you love your daughter, that\u2019s a given, but the cat deserved loved too and you considered them / their well being.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The only \u201cresponsibility\u201d I \u201cput\u201d on her was just asking her to spend some time with them here and there bc they like her and are bonded with not just me but her as well.
