Why should a man have to wait in a line to use a facility designated for them if the line is full of women? Any facility that has a designated personnel should always allow first priority them. I'm sorry if you have to piss, but men in general only use a stall if they have to poop. If a man needs a stall, they *need* a stall.\n\nEven if a man just uses the stall to quickly pee, they should get priority. Toilet stage fright is a real thing especially at crowded venues. Toilet stage fright gets even worse when there are women potentially watching. Using a toilet definitely minimizes that problem. You can wait a little longer to use the men's facility. It's their facility, not yours.\n\n>Seriously, how can planners not have figured out yet that it takes at least four times as long for a female to piss as a male?\n\nLike you mentioned, the real problem is that the sizes and quantities of women's restrooms at public venues. Why, on average, are women's restrooms the same size area as men's? Stalls use more space than urinals. Also it takes more time to pull down pants and underwear (or just the underwear if wearing a skirt/dress) and sit/squat than it does to unzip a zipper and move a penis through the fly or over the top of their underwear.\n\nWomen's restrooms *need* to be bigger to accommodate the fact stalls use more space. Add onto the fact that on average it will take *at least* a few more seconds just to prep to use the toilet, takes longer to clean up, and then longer to redress. Every moment matters when you are potentially serving thousands of people!\n\nEDIT: Also, OP you are NTA.", "I pissed 6 minutes straight once.
