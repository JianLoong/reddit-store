I heard a bunch of people say \u201chey\u201d or \u201cwoah\u201d and kept walking. I was in side and the line of women continued as I headed to the wall of urinals (which no one was at).\n\nA woman near the front of the line said, \u201c excuse me, there\u2019s a line.\u201d I said, \u201cokay well I\u2019m going to use the urinal and there\u2019s not one for that.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cI don\u2019t care.

It's meant for us. I think all public bathrooms should be unisex, but our society isn't there yet.", "NTA. I agree with a lot of what the other commentors have already said. One additional thing: if you went into the line you would be forcing someone to wait longer than necessary when you were just going to use a urinal. Line wasn't for the urinals.", "NTA\u2026seems like this was the men\u2019s room line that this line was for?  I don\u2019t see what you did wrong going in and using the urinal.  No men were waiting in queue.", "NTA, you're a man and you belong in the men's restroom. Nothing wrong with the women trying to use it too I guess, but they were the guests.", "NTA, they were in the men's line. If they were smart, they would have brought a she-wee so they could use the urinals too.", "NTA. That\u2019s, sadly, what you deal with as a female at events: a sad sad lackluster nr of toilets.\n\nI\u2019ve had to queue up for the gents more than once, always politely holding up a hand to shield my gaze when passing the urinals, not because I\u2019m a prude but it\u2019s not for me to decide for those gents if they like their bits on display.\n\nIf a man comes in to use the urinals nobody says anything beyond maybe a \u2018lucky you man\u2019. But if he goes for the stalls it\u2019s \u2018back in line buster.\u2019 And he\u2019ll have to wait his turn like anyone else. \n\nSeriously, how can planners not have figured out yet that it takes at least four times as long for a female to piss as a male?", "NTA.

Technically it was them who were intruding.", "Not only were you in the men's bathroom, not only was there no line for the urinal...what if all you needed to do was wash your hands?

I'm a woman, and if you're in the men's room, then you gotta expect that a man will come in to take care of business.

That's ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nIf there are separate men's and women's facilities, typically the rule of thumb is that you can use the *other* restroom if no one of that gender is using it.\n\nWhile I'm glad to see that people are less concerned about what equipment you have when visiting whichever lavatory, you're correct. No one was using the urinal. If they didn't believe gender should affect who is using the restroom, then they wouldn't have a problem using the stall(s) while you were in there *anyway*.\n\nEither way you're in the clear.

Honestly, I wouldn't have engaged with her at all.\n\nYou're definitely NTA", "So you used the bathroom that\u2019s meant only for men and not women and they got mad at you for even being polite enough to just use the urinal and not telling them to go to their own restroom,( que sarcastic tone ) yeah your a total dick dude", "NTA I might get downvoted for this, but I feel like you should\u2019ve had priority. You said in another comment that the line was for the men\u2019s room. It\u2019s kinda like disabled bathrooms, but less pertinent. Yeah the women\u2019s room was overflowing, but the men\u2019s room is for men.
