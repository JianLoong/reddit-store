My best friend from college Hannah (24F) is dating a boy named Doug (25M). Doug has had the same friend group since high school. When I visit Hannah in her hometown (maybe once or twice a month),I hang out with her and Doug and the friend group. I am in group chats with this friend group, been invited to events / parties for this group, etc. One of the friends in the group, Sam (25ishM) is engaged to Mary (25ishF). A year ago (January 2022) Mary asked me in person if I would go to her & Sam\u2019s wedding. At the time I was talking to a guy, and so she told me I could have a plus one. \n\nThe wedding is next month (April 2023). About 2 months ago I was given the wedding invitation via mail with my name and, again, a mention of the plus one. Just last month I was given the link to RSVP. I RSVPed and the next question was asking if I would be bringing my plus one. I am now dating someone (different than the original guy I was talking to when invited to the wedding) so I accepted. The wedding is about 4 states over, my boyfriend lives in that state. So it was obvious I would bring him. \n\nI was talking in the friend group about the logistics of the wedding. Sam and Mary were not present. We were talking about getting a 15 person van to all ride together in to the wedding. I was talking about how excited I was to invite my boyfriend to the wedding since he lived in the state it is taking place in. Hannah chimed in and told me that my bf would not be invited. Doug also chimed in saying that my bf could not be my plus one. I was obviously pissed and said \u2018it\u2019s a good thing it isn\u2019t your choice who my plus one is\u2019. They were mad to be called out. The other friends told me i should invite my bf and didn\u2019t see any issue with it. Then Hannah said i need to see him in my free time and that it would be inappropriate to invite him to a small wedding. She said \u2018it\u2019s a wedding not a vacation\u2019. (Btw, they all know that i have a plus one invite. So there wasn\u2019t just a communication issue)\n\nFast forward to 2 weeks later (about 2 weeks ago). Hannah texted me asking me about hotel situations. She also said that \u2018I know things got heated but YOU are invited to the wedding.\u2019 Then asked if I was still going. I told her that I will go only if my boyfriend is made to feel welcome. She told me again that it was inappropriate to invite him and he would be excluded from any activities we partake in. He wouldn\u2019t be allowed to step foot on the van. No dinners w the group. Cannot come to the beach with us. He would only be allowed to attend the wedding. Nothing more. So I cancelled. I contacted the bride and told her something came up. I didn\u2019t out Hannah. Or tell the bride the true reason. Hannah responded 2 days later saying \u2018thank you for making a decision\u2019. We have not had contact since. AITA?\n\nInfo: the reason I cancelled on the bride is bc she is Hannah\u2019s bfs friends fianc\u00e9. She isn\u2019t close in the friend group.

I've been to my friends cousins weddings as a plus one and had never ever met the bride or groom before that day and they were still so stoked that I came and partied with them. That's the vibe of a truly great wedding.  \nYou were given a plus one. Hannah sounds like a jealous B and like she wants you all to herself. Ignore her and maybe consider going to see your boyfriend and go to the wedding and just doing your own thing.

It has absolutely NOTHING to do with Hannah, because it's NOT Hannah's wedding. If you want to go to the wedding, go and bring your plus 1. If you don't want to go, don't go. Simple. Just leave Hannah's bizarre possessiveness over Mary's wedding guests out of it all together. No drama whatsoever. Do you think Hannah is going to shout, \"Hey, I said you couldn't bring that guy!\"  Everybody would look at her like she sprouted a second head. NTA if your decision is based on your own choice.", "Weird. NTA, but your friends reaction is wild", "Not disagreeing there at all. Was trying to decide between NTA and N A H. If it was a really small, intimate gathering, I could see it being potentially a little awkward for the group. You'd still be okay to bring your bf, but I would understand the hesitation. But it isn't a small wedding, so there's no reason for any concern on the non-bride's part. Invite away.", "Did you indicate that it would be 2 of you or where there no spot for that?", "I still think the bride deserves the truth. What must SHE be thinking about you?", "good point.", "You\u2019re right !!", "But I was. So your comment is irrelevant", "Omg great question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd72", "Ooooo great point", "Tell me about it", "Great points. Thank you for the support", "There was a question that said \u2018will you be using your plus one?\u2019 And I had to choose between yes or no.", "And I chose yes. So therefore 2 of us", "I read it as saying if you are such a fringe friend to the couple getting married that you bringing your SO is causing this reaction, they shouldn\u2019t have put you in this position in the first place. It\u2019s rude and impolite to invite someone, give them a plus one and then everyone act like they are crashing the wedding. If it\u2019s really that intimate of a celebration, then they should have been more careful with their invites. Instead you got dragged into  this nonsense", "Let me know if there's an update like if you go or tell the bride and groom.", "Well, Hannah sounds awful! Hope you make the best decision serves YOU the most. And someday, I hope you tell the bride about what went down. NTA", "Oh yeah I see how that reads now", "I will. Just need to think of the best way to approach it", "NTA, but I think you've got some unexpected outcomes heading your way...\n\n1. I get (1) you decided it wasn't worth coming to the wedding if your bf would be treated rudely and (2) you didn't bother the bride with the drama of your true reason for declining.\n2. However, several others in the friend group know that Hannah and Doug were strongly telling you how unwelcome they would make your bf feel. Word is going to get back to both Sam and Mary. It will be very interesting to see how the group and, especially, Sam (and Mary) view this.\n3. Although your bf seems to have no connection to this friend group, it's hard not to wonder if there's some history that Doug and Hannah aren't revealing. Does your bf have any idea why? Since Mary (I'm guessing) and your bf are from the same state, maybe there is a history (even an indirect connection) between them. (For example, could bf have bullied or dated Mary or a sibling of hers?)\n4. Have Hannah and Doug ever met your bf? Were they this rude to him? Can you ask them to come clean about some hidden reason - or to at least tell you that there is a reason that your bf specifically should not attend. They are certainly looking like jerks here, but it is possible they are awkwardly trying to prevent something bad from happening.... OR is there any difference in race or religion that may be playing a part? If it's just (weirdly) about the wedding, will they happily embrace your bf at other gatherings? All those factors will also affect how you view Doug and Hannah and how your friendship proceeds from here.", "Esh. You say Mary's your best friend from college so why are you letting Hannah stop you from being at the wedding and why are you lying to Mary about the reason you're not going? \n\nHow do you think she's going to feel if she ever finds out the truth, What's more important your best friend or what Hannah thinks.", "ESH. Hannah had no business telling you who you could and could not bring to someone else's wedding, especially after the bride already told you you could bring someone. I would have gone over Hannah's head if I were you, and contacted the bride directly and confirmed with her. The hell with Hannah. It's not her wedding.", "I am confused as to why you didn\u2019t ask Hannah & Doug what their problem is. \nAre you not curious? Or do they behave like this a lot? \n\nMy first port of call would have been to ask Hannah and Doug what their problem was and depending on that I would have made a decision. \nNo way would I let a pair of nobodies dictate who I can bring as my plus one to a wedding that isn\u2019t even theirs.", ">Going with ESH because Mary invited you and a plus one and you're bailing because of what the not bride is trying to dictate.\n\nIt's not \"bailing\" to change your RSVP when it's clear your date is going to be treated in a shitty fashion.", "A friend of a friend's wedding. And how does that make OP an asshole, exactly?", "Your judgement means that OP is the only asshole. Do you mean E S H? Because Hannah and Doug are clearly the biggest assholes here, even if you somehow think OP is also an asshole.", "Honestly I think you are overlooking how the bride views you. I had a large wedding and I didn't let one of my pastor's have a plus one because I didn't know his girlfriend well enough to want her there. On the other hand, I gave other friends plus ones because I wanted them there and wanted them to be comfortable. The bride went through the energy of inviting, inputting it on the website that you get to bring someone, adding it to the invitation, and now someone else is dictating your actions. \n\nThere are a lot of steps and choices the bride has to make to get to you having a plus one.", "I would tell the bride as well, Hannah might have tried/try doing the same thing to other guests as well considering it worked so well with op.", "I wonder if the bride or groom had a word with your (ex)friend to say they\u2019re unhappy you\u2019re bringing someone, especially if you\u2019re not close to them. Your (ex) friend went all mean girl on you though.", "NTA but call the bride and tell her the Truth.", "Wtf were you discussing this whole thing with Hannah? She's not the host. She's not in charge of the guest list and she's MASSIVELY overstepping on Mary and Sam by dictating who can and can't come to THEIR wedding and participate in what activities.\n\nYTA for canceling after you RSVPed without giving Mary and Sam the courtesy of explaining what really happened and letting them handle the guest list which is for them to have a final say on, not for Hannah.\n\nThe first time Hannah overstepped on Mary and Sam you should've contacted them and cleared the issue up with them. Maybe sth changed. Maybe Hannah was inserting herself where she had no business of being. Either way, the adult thing to do was explaining what actually happened to ppl who invited you as their guest, not snubbing them out at the last moment, bc one of your mutual friends is an AH.", "ESH. What business is it of Hannah and Doug who attends Mary and Sam's wedding? And why did you pay any attention to them?", "NTA. Hannah and her bf seem a bit controlling. Id honestly find new friends.", "NTA - You were invited with a plus one and can thus bring whoever you want. It isn't Hannahs wedding so she can't gatekeep who you're allowed to bring or not. Bit of an AH move to last minute cancel on the wedding though, after having RSVP'd that you're coming and it's not an emergency, since the bride and groom have planned/payed for you to be there.", "This is the only explanation that makes sense and it just barely makes sense. The whole story is so bizarre, it feels like it was written by an AI.", "It sounds like Hannah was the only one with an issue. Your invitation came from the couple getting married, not Hannah. You should have talked to them. Hannah had absolutely no right to tell you who your plus one could be.", "Its bailing to not turn up to a wedding after RSVPing without explaining why to the people who invited you.", "Hannah is OP\u2019s link to the friend group through Hannah\u2019s boyfriend. Sadly if Hannah goes on a campaign against OP that\u2019s the cutting off of the link.\n\nThe real question is WHY Hannah doesn\u2019t want OP to integrate with the group. Because the campaign has begun.\n\nOP is dealing with this whole situation with grace, but she needs to revisit her friendship with Hannah to see if it\u2019s a connection worth keeping. It doesn\u2019t look promising.", "I think you should let the bride know...like, a couple weeks after the wedding. If I were the bride, I would like to know so I would be able to distance myself from someone like Hannah. I would be pissed if someone went behind my back to dictate who was and wasn't invited to my wedding, especially when I gave the green light on a plus 1", "You should have asked the bride and groom directly and tell them the situation truthfully and that whatever decision they communicate to you it would be no problem and no upsets. I wouldn't let Hannah s entitlement stand nor allow her to make me an Ah in Mary s eyes by not going.", "I agree. Attend the wedding anyways. And I\u2019m even tempted to tell you to let the bride know what Hannah and Doug are up to. One thing is for sure, Hannah sucks big time.", "Have you considered that the groom wanted you there? Just because you and the bride both have vaginas doesn't mean that she is your connection to the wedding. Yes, it's her day, but it's also his, and he's in your friend group.", "Did your invitation come from the bridal couple? Did you RSVP, including a plus one, to the bridal couple? I'm guessing the answer to both of those questions is yes. The ONLY people you should be talking to are the bridal couple. How well you feel you know them is irrelevant. *THEY INVITED YOU AND A PLUS ONE*. Talk to them. If the positions were reversed, would you want a \"Hannah\"  making decisions about your guest list? Hannah inserted herself. If the bride or groom ends up pissed at her, it is her own fault, not yours. If it were me, I would want to know that a supposed friend had grossly overstepped.", "I read that as Cologio was trying to point out that you may not be as far removed from the bride as you think. You said that you are just the bride's fianc\u00e9's friend's gf's friend. If that is all you are, then you really shouldn't have been invited. \n\nBut you did get an invite! Like, have you read the threads in weddingdrama? So many involve close family and friends not getting invited or not getting a plus one. You got an invitation which is more than what Hannah got. It seems to me that at some point Mary upgraded you from 'friend of a friend of a friend' to just 'friend'. Not a close friend but still a friend who's worthy of an invitation AND a plus one!\n\nSure Mary may not be upset that you've chosen to decline but that doesn't mean she won't be glad if you choose to go.\n\nAnd from your post, it seems that only Doug and Hannah seem to be gatekeeping the wedding. The others in the friends group appear to be fine with you bringing your BF. So who's gonna make you feel unwelcome? Just Hannah and Doug. Out of the bride and groom, the friends group and the hundreds of others guests. \n\nYou let Hannah and Doug bully you out of the wedding and you are also going to let them get away with it. \n\nAt the very least,  I'd inform the bride what has happened. Who knows what else Hannah and Doug are doing behind their backs.\n\nIf it turns out that Mary was in on it, then at least you know exactly where you stand with these group of friends.", "Yeah, also, I would rethink my friendship with Hannah. She seems weirdly controlling over a wedding that's not even hers...", "Thank u"]}
