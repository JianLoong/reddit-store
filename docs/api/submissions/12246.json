My best friend from college Hannah (24F) is dating a boy named Doug (25M). Doug has had the same friend group since high school. When I visit Hannah in her hometown (maybe once or twice a month),I hang out with her and Doug and the friend group. I am in group chats with this friend group, been invited to events / parties for this group, etc. One of the friends in the group, Sam (25ishM) is engaged to Mary (25ishF). A year ago (January 2022) Mary asked me in person if I would go to her & Sam\u2019s wedding. At the time I was talking to a guy, and so she told me I could have a plus one. \n\nThe wedding is next month (April 2023). About 2 months ago I was given the wedding invitation via mail with my name and, again, a mention of the plus one. Just last month I was given the link to RSVP. I RSVPed and the next question was asking if I would be bringing my plus one. I am now dating someone (different than the original guy I was talking to when invited to the wedding) so I accepted. The wedding is about 4 states over, my boyfriend lives in that state. So it was obvious I would bring him. \n\nI was talking in the friend group about the logistics of the wedding. Sam and Mary were not present. We were talking about getting a 15 person van to all ride together in to the wedding. I was talking about how excited I was to invite my boyfriend to the wedding since he lived in the state it is taking place in. Hannah chimed in and told me that my bf would not be invited. Doug also chimed in saying that my bf could not be my plus one. I was obviously pissed and said \u2018it\u2019s a good thing it isn\u2019t your choice who my plus one is\u2019. They were mad to be called out. The other friends told me i should invite my bf and didn\u2019t see any issue with it. Then Hannah said i need to see him in my free time and that it would be inappropriate to invite him to a small wedding. She said \u2018it\u2019s a wedding not a vacation\u2019. (Btw, they all know that i have a plus one invite. So there wasn\u2019t just a communication issue)\n\nFast forward to 2 weeks later (about 2 weeks ago). Hannah texted me asking me about hotel situations. She also said that \u2018I know things got heated but YOU are invited to the wedding.\u2019 Then asked if I was still going. I told her that I will go only if my boyfriend is made to feel welcome. She told me again that it was inappropriate to invite him and he would be excluded from any activities we partake in. He wouldn\u2019t be allowed to step foot on the van. No dinners w the group. Cannot come to the beach with us. He would only be allowed to attend the wedding. Nothing more. So I cancelled. I contacted the bride and told her something came up. I didn\u2019t out Hannah. Or tell the bride the true reason. Hannah responded 2 days later saying \u2018thank you for making a decision\u2019. We have not had contact since. AITA?\n\nInfo: the reason I cancelled on the bride is bc she is Hannah\u2019s bfs friends fianc\u00e9. She isn\u2019t close in the friend group.

I've been to my friends cousins weddings as a plus one and had never ever met the bride or groom before that day and they were still so stoked that I came and partied with them. That's the vibe of a truly great wedding.  \nYou were given a plus one. Hannah sounds like a jealous B and like she wants you all to herself. Ignore her and maybe consider going to see your boyfriend and go to the wedding and just doing your own thing.

I should know! \ud83d\ude02", "I don't think you're causing wedding drama at all. Mary invited you to her wedding and wrote on your invitation that you could bring a plus 1. She didn't put the former guy's name on it; she put \"plus 1,\"  or \"Your name and escort,\" or however she worded it. That means you are allowed to bring the person you want. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with Hannah, because it's NOT Hannah's wedding. If you want to go to the wedding, go and bring your plus 1. If you don't want to go, don't go. Simple. Just leave Hannah's bizarre possessiveness over Mary's wedding guests out of it all together. No drama whatsoever. Do you think Hannah is going to shout, \"Hey, I said you couldn't bring that guy!\"  Everybody would look at her like she sprouted a second head. NTA if your decision is based on your own choice.", "Weird. NTA, but your friends reaction is wild", "Not disagreeing there at all. Was trying to decide between NTA and N A H. If it was a really small, intimate gathering, I could see it being potentially a little awkward for the group. You'd still be okay to bring your bf, but I would understand the hesitation. But it isn't a small wedding, so there's no reason for any concern on the non-bride's part. Invite away.", "Did you indicate that it would be 2 of you or where there no spot for that?", "I still think the bride deserves the truth. What must SHE be thinking about you?", "good point.", "You\u2019re right !!", "But I was. So your comment is irrelevant", "Omg great question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd72", "Ooooo great point", "Tell me about it", "Great points. Thank you for the support", "There was a question that said \u2018will you be using your plus one?\u2019 And I had to choose between yes or no.", "And I chose yes. So therefore 2 of us", "I read it as saying if you are such a fringe friend to the couple getting married that you bringing your SO is causing this reaction, they shouldn\u2019t have put you in this position in the first place. It\u2019s rude and impolite to invite someone, give them a plus one and then everyone act like they are crashing the wedding. If it\u2019s really that intimate of a celebration, then they should have been more careful with their invites. Instead you got dragged into  this nonsense", "Let me know if there's an update like if you go or tell the bride and groom.", "Well, Hannah sounds awful! Hope you make the best decision serves YOU the most. And someday, I hope you tell the bride about what went down. NTA", "Oh yeah I see how that reads now", "I will. Just need to think of the best way to approach it"]}
