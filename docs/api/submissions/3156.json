So I was attending a wedding last week and it was between my long-time friend and his girlfriend of 6 years. My friend, who I'll call John, is muslim and doesn't live in the U.S. I met him online and we've been friends for almost 10 years. John is also friends with the groom. John decided to come here and visit and to attend the wedding.\n\nSo here's the situation. He got here a few days before the wedding and crashed at my place. He asked if it was cool if I made sure anything he ate / was planning on eating during his stay was halal. (Doesn't contain pork, alcohol, etc.) I agreed and I made sure to cook things for us that didn't include anything like that. I decided it would be best not to take him out to eat or get fast food because it would be really hard to tell.\n\nSo come the day of the wedding, we obviously aren't together the whole time at the event. Still, John wants to enjoy some food and drinks, understandable, but can't find me. So he'd just ask other people or just stay away. On one occasion, John did find me and asked if a little appetizer thing he had had pork or anything in it. I honestly didn't know so I said, \"I don't know, but I'd assume not.\" So he ate it. Later on though, he found out it did have pork in it, and got angry at me. I told him that I just said what I knew, that I didn't know. I told him that he took the chance and that's on him.\n\nDid I do wrong here?", "created_utc": 1669316430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3rvcj/aita_for_letting_my_muslim_friend_eat_something/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You obviously did not know, and i think he should have asked the chefs who made it or the waiters for better advice.", "NTA you aren\u2019t the cook or a server, he could have asked either", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult and if he chooses to follow such a dietary restriction, then it's fully on him to make sure that he, you know, follows it.", "NTA. IMO, this should be the same as having a deadly food allergy. You only eat it if you know **for sure** that it is safe for you to eat. This is on him.", "NTA you said you didn't know, he should have asked someone who knew for sure", "I was all ready, from the title, to go the other way, but as it sits you are definitely NTA. He needs to do his own research or not eat the thing, not rely on you and then blame you if you're wrong.\n\nI have a bunch of food allergies and a few of them are to common things. I always do my own research (ask the caterer, google the dish and see what the ingredients usually are) and if I'm not satisfied that I know it's safe, I don't eat it.\n\nJohn needs to take some responsibility for his own religious needs.", "NTA\nYou didn't know either like you said.\nSo when in doubt, he should have skipped the dish.", "People with food restrictions usually are well aware that they need to inquire about food being served to them. He could have asked the wait staff or anyone who was involved in planning the party and its menus.\n\nIts a standard for people with food restrictions.\n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA - be different if you did it on purpose. Dude needs to move on accidents happen.", "NTA\n\nIf you have a allergy and are at a strangers wedding you don't eat the food you are personally unsure of so he should adopt the same thinking. Taking a persons assumption who had no hand in preparation of said food is you taking a chance.\n\nIts his responsibility to ask catering.", "NTA. I follow a strict diet too living in the UK so I either read the ingredients or ask the person who prepared it or has knowledge. I'm inclined to say I would be slightly disappointed if I asked and was told the wrong information but that's not for you to know. Next time perhaps you should just say \" I don't know\" save yourself the hassle.", "I can't see how he can reasonably get enraged at you for telling him \"I don't know, but I'd assume not.\" - you absolutely didn't categorically state that it was definitely halal.\n\nI suspect it's more that he's really annoyed that he ate something non-halal, and wants to lash out at someone else rather than take the blame himself.\n\nNTA. If you want to take your dietary restrictions seriously, you make judgements on better information than \"I'd assume not\".", "NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s just taking his anger of messing up on you. He should have asked for a second opinion before eating. Unless this is your own micro-aggression to something about John.", "NTA\n\nhe's projecting because he feels guilty that he's sinned according to his religion, and his feelings of guilt are being deflected into anger that he's taking out on you.\n\nwhich is extra silly on his part, because from what little i remember of islam dietary edicts there are exceptions and considerations for accidental slip-ups or when visiting places where the culture is different or they don't have access to halal foods. he's just mad at himself and not processing it very well.", "NTA. Where\u2019s his voice? Surely he could communicate his own needs/dietary restrictions in a place where you had no control over preparing the food he was potentially consuming.", "NTA If you aren\u2019t sure, don\u2019t eat it.  He should know this.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"\"I don't know, but I'd assume not.\" \".. This is pretty< clear: YOu don't know, so it is HIS decisson to risk it.", "NTA it\u2019s not like you prepared a dish with pork in it. When you said you didn\u2019t know it was up it him, as an adult to find out before he ate it", "Favouring NTA, given that the restrictions are his and not yours. Out of curiosity, was there a specific food that caused the problem?", "NTA. Not your problem and you're not his babysitter. Also you were not a cook that prepare those. He can shove his anger up his. It's not your duty to know what's in food. Would comment more but... rule 1.", "NAH \n\nyou were honest and said you don\u2019t know and he chose to eat it anyway. i understand his frustration since he was relying on you though, i think maybe he thought you saying \u2018i assume not\u2019 was a green light possibly? \n\nif it were me i think i\u2019d apologise for giving the wrong impression just incase", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He should be the one monitoring his dietary restrictions, that\u2019s his responsibility. It\u2019s one thing for him to ask if you\u2019d mind making sure the foods you were cooking and serving him were halal, but when you\u2019re out and about / if someone else is making the food, it\u2019s 100% on him to be monitoring, asking questions, and, if he\u2019s serious about it, not be taking risks.", "NTA. What was stopping him from asking the servers/ caterers?", "Food restrictions are ONE'S OWN problem. Unless you were the chef he should not have been asking you. He needs to grow up and stop needing his hand held. NTA", "As a pescatarian, NTA. John is an adult who needs to handle his own dietary strictures. You aren\u2019t his babysitter.", "NTA, keeping Halal is his own responsibility, and you already did a nice thing for him as a friend by supporting his efforts. You weren't malicious at all, and at the end of the day, the choice to risk that food was one HE made.", "NTA but I completely understand his anger\nIt\u2019s not your fault that he ate pork, but his anger is completely valid", "NTA ... you were honest about not being sure so taking the \"risk\" was on him. Pretty simple in my opinion. Kinda dick-move trying to put the blame on you.", "NTA The responsibility at the event was on himself, as he was the one choosing and eating. He shouldn't put that responsibility on you, outside food you are buying and cooking in your own home. This is a HIM problem, not a YOU problem.", "NTA. You told him you didn't know. If he is really serious about keeping halal, he would not have eaten it. You shouldn't have \"assumed\" that the appetizer was halal. Unless such things are specified as being halal, they most likely wouldn't be, but it is still his own responsibility what he stuffs in his face.", " Nta. He's grown and if he had restrictions he is responsible for figuring out what he can or can't have. Grown man.", "OP=NTA\n\n1) Unless you were the caterer it was stupid of him to assume you knew\n\n2 ) You told him you didn't know;  he is in charge of regulating his diet.", "NTA. He\u2019s a fricking adult and needs to take care of himself.", "NTA he instead of telling the chef went to you its on him.", "NTA.", "No. You gave him your best opinion.", "YTA... your friend is going to be denied his 72 virgins because of you...", "This.  How were you supposed to know?  NTA", "It was a little appetizer thing with bread and meat. I don't know what it's called, but it has pork in it.", "Eh, I think I would have answered differently (I don't know, you'll need to ask one of the caterers) but I would maintain it's still his own responsibility."]}
