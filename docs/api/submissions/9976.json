How can you plan a wedding to a guy not yet divorced?  He\u2019s had at least 2 years to solve this, and it\u2019s odd he never noticed the divorce decree not coming through years ago.  And if it\u2019s actually true that the lawyer didn\u2019t file the papers properly, the lawyer would seemingly have to fox the situation without additional charge or you could file with the state Bar Association.  I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d need another attorney in the first place.  Something isn\u2019t right with your boyfriend\u2019s actions or story.", "NTA, but think long and hard about whether to consider yourself \"engaged\" -- your dude is married, and whatever his lawyer did or didn't do, he knew whether he had a divorce decree in hand or not when he proposed to you. Stop the wedding planning until dude actually manages to get divorced, for real.", "NTA\n\nDoesn't matter what day it is. You told him to take care of his personal business in finishing the divorce. He chose not to do that for the last two years. Now suddenly he wants you to drop papers for him? Um, no. He's had two years to do that. Why is it suddenly so important that it be done now, when he is otherwise occupied and wants you to do it?\n\nSeriously, he's not showing you much respect here. If he was, he would have taken care of this immediately when he was informed the divorce papers weren't filed TWO YEARS AGO.", "You \"ruined\" valentines day by refusing to interfere in his marriage? Take note, OP, this guy's idea of celebrating your love for one another involves you running errands for him.  \n\nIs the new lawyer single? That's the only potential upside I see here.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re not his mommy. This is a very bad sign, OP. If he can\u2019t even take care of his divorce papers, what can he do by himself?", "NTA.  And fyi, I don't think the divorce will go through in time for your wedding.\n\nEven after everything is filed with the Judge, judges in NY routinely sit on the papers for two months before approving them.\n\nHe had five years to get divorced and didn't. \"If he wanted to, he would\" applies here; this is a man who's happy to get divorced, but unwilling to do the work/adulting involved.  \n\nRed flag. Take a look at your relationship without falling for the sunk cost fallacy.", "Ruining Valentines Day is something fiance did all by himself. Figuring out his own problem with his divorce is not your responsibility, no matter what day it is. Downright selfish, honestly. \n\nNTA", "NTA - This is a major red flag. What all else does he expect you to do for him? He sounds like he wants a mommy wife, not a partnership.", "NTA. Do not let him weaponize incompetence.", "NTA but he's known about needing to get his divorce sorted out for two years and he's done nothing about it? Red flag city. He's either still married and is running away from childcare responsibilities, you're the side piece, or he has no intention of marrying you", "NTA. I don't see how you ruined anything - why can't he do it himself like a big kid?", "NTA - you were very specific when you said this was something he had to do on his own.  Doesn't matter what day it is.  Too many red flags here.  Are you really sure you want to marry him?", "Curious but is this what you want for the future? A person who can't take care of their own responsibilities and then blames you when the fall out hits? You deserve better and you're NTA here.", "NTA and the ruining Valentine's Day thing is pretty funny. (I hope you also found that amusing, OP).  \n\nI apologize if it made you hurt or sad, I am not intending to be mean.   \nMy 22 years married old arse would laugh like a sonic boom at that line.  \nI hope you continue to maintain your stance. \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f good for you.

It sure sounds like he doesn't care that much about getting divorced.  I hope you can get that straightened out before you're out too much wedding money.", "NTA, and I also think it's very inconsiderate of him to ask you to do this on this particular day. (Apart from the fact you also have been very clear about not getting involved in his divorce.)", "NTA. You told him upfront that you would not get involved in his divorce, and then he pulls a stunt like this. It sounds like he's deliberately sabotaging your plans and your relationship. \n\nYou should reconsider any wedding plans with this guy. He's not that interested in divorcing his ex, and he doesn't give a crap about your boundaries or feelings (he deliberately ruined Valentine's Day for you).", "NTA. You made it clear that you would not be helping with this task and (presumably) he accepted that. You need to be legally divorced before you can get married again, and the fact that he hasn\u2019t done this already is a little\u2026 ???", "NTA, why are with him? He seems to be a mediocre guy at best. Getting angry at you for not having his shit together? Pretty big red flag.\n\nOfficially you can't be engaged to a married man and filing a divorce can take months. Not to mention his wife can stall it for extra time as well.", "NTA, why did it take so long for him to figure out his divorce didn\u2019t go though? Major red flag. He needs to figure his shit out and I\u2019d hold out on the wedding so you don\u2019t waste any money if the divorce doesn\u2019t go through on time.", "I don't even consider valatines day a legit holiday anymore. More of a corporate holiday than anything else. \n\nIt's wild to me people try to treat this like chirstmas.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAlso, I'm suspect of his story. Did he not ever wonder why he didn't get a final decree of divorce or have to do anything to finalize it? I've been divorced. It's a little more than just a lawyer filing the papers.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe ruined V day by asking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Are you sure that manipulative AH is the right one for you?", "INFO: Why does he want you to help, and why don't you want to?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ouch.", "NTA", "NTA - Really sorry OP, but I think your fiance ruined Valentines Day by remaining married to someone else. Please don't consider yourself engaged to this man. No matter what excuse he comes up with, it's clearly not important to him to divorce his wife, and without that, he cannot marry you. It seems like he wants to play at being engaged, but seems unlikely to follow through.", "NTA and your boyfriend is being shady.

You said after the engagement but that could be anytime since 2021. Also, why did he ask you to drop off the papers? Were you coincidentally going to be in the same area as the lawyer's office? If this is a pattern with him, putting things to last minute, constantly asking you to pick up his slack etc do you really want to do this for a lifetime?", "NTA. He is TA. He not only does not handle his business, he tries to get you to do it after you set a boundary about it. Then he tries to deflect by accusing you of ruining Valentine\u2019s Day. You didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a weapon he\u2019s using to deflect responsibility for his actions and try to make you the bad guy. Do not expect this to change after marriage. He\u2019s showing you who he is.", "Run!!", "YTA\nAsk yourself this: if it had been a lease agreement he asked you to drop off at a landlords location, would you have said 'no'?  \nHe wasn't asking you to testify under oath.  He asked you to run an errand for him", "He's had 5 years to notice. 4 years to fix it since they've been together, and 2 years to really get a move on it. If he doesn't get it fixed, no wedding can happen legally. Now he's waiting till the year of to get it fixed? Not to mention, it might take a minute for a judge to finalize it depending where they are at. I hope for OPs sake he gets it done. And also, if a divorce happens in the future not to leave it up to him to file it. I don't trust the lawyers he picks", "I've been through a divorce. I don't believe any part of his story about not realizing he wasn't.", "Agreed. The guy knows she won\u2019t help, so he is setting her up to be the fall guy.

Mine was separated a year, and 6 months after filing we were legally divorced.  My friend had to wait a year after filing to be deemed divorced legally, even though they were separated for 4years prior."]}
