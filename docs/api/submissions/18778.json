The report itself is 15 pages, far too long to include all of the explanation in this post.\n\nWe're still reviewing this as a team, and seeing what we have to learn. We'd love to hear your thoughts as well.", "created_utc": 1685714723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ydrba/aita_monthly_open_forum_june_2023_reddit_survey/", "score": 21, "replies": [">70.16% feel that people generally behave appropriately\n\nWell that's funny.", "I don't quite understand this sub. I made a profile to make a thread but after reading the rules it seems like just about every conceivable topic is not allowed here.\n\nThe front page is full of threads that are about relationships or work. Which is against the rules? Half the posts are about weddings. A wedding is not about a relationship? \n\nAnd sorting by new is an exercise in frustration as just about every thread you reply to gets locked.\n\nVery confused.", "The people that don't either post rule 11-banned posts, downvote comments they don't agree with, or argue with mods about civility.", "Since few people really read the rules, most don't even know what appropriate behavior is for this community.", "Sorry if this seems like a bit of a stupid question, but what does \"benchmark\" mean in this context?", ">The front page is full of threads that are about relationships or work. Which is against the rules?\n\nIt takes some getting used to when it comes to what stays and what gets deleted.  Even then, shitposts, accounts getting banned, not answering judgement bot etc still make posting in new a bit of a guessing game.\n\nWith relationships, it generally boils down to whether the issue could happen outside of a relationship.  Also, no partings so \"AITA for no longer being friends with....\" would be a rule break.  A lot of the issues that spring up from weddings could also occur at any particularly lavish bash in some variety.\n\nFor work, I think posts can (or at least should) pass that involve certain issues.  But \"AITA for leaving a job\" will be deleted as would \"AITA for not working a shift\" or \"AITA for asking for a pay rise\" etc...  If a conflict happens at work that could happen outside of a work situation then I think it's ok to stay.\n\nI'm not 100% on all of the above though.", "Ha, I meant to edit that into the copy and it slipped my mind! Here's the explanation from the report:\n\n>Note: Each statistic will include a benchmark. This benchmark is the average response for communities of similar size & activity to your community. \n\nThere were somewhere in the ballpark of 200 communities participating in this, so they had a pretty decent amount to compare to.", "Ah, I see. Thanks for the information. :)", "Sorting by new (which I most often do) is an education in how often people post without even thinking to read the rules as to what's appropriate. And, it's an education as to how people want to use this *very* popular sub and its amplification out to the larger world as a platform for their opinions. \n\nIf you do want to sort by new, the best thing you can do is become acquainted with the rules, think about them before responding, and report any post you think breaks the rules. \n\nAnd, no matter how careful you are, you will find yourself replying to a thread that got locked after you started to comment.  Reddit's user experience for that is really, really terrible and, if you're like me, will feel a bit silly for responding in the first place.", "What is the point of these restrictions?", "Weddings don\u2019t happen outside of relationships. I\u2019m fine with the rules but let\u2019s all agree they don\u2019t make sense lol", "We actually answer both in [our faq](https://www.reddit.com//r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\nFor Rule 11\n\n>* We're not here to arbitrate issues surrounding consent. You can date or not date whoever you like. You can be or not be attracted to whoever you like. You can be friends with or not be friends with whoever you like. This isn't something that requires moral arbitration. If you want to know if it's ok to ghost your former bestie or former soulmate, this isn't the place to ask.\n\nFor business conflicts:\n\n>* AITA's focus is on conflicts between people. Businesses are not people. A conflict with someone acting on behalf of a business is not an interpersonal conflict. \n\nBut overall, the sub has a specific purpose of judging actions that lead to an interpersonal conflict. Post restrictions are in place to keep the sub focused.", "There's other subs for those issues, and they're always the same and very boring. People asking \"AITA for calling out a bigot\" is getting up there too", "Wedding posts aren\u2019t about the relationships themselves though. Asking \u201caita for not inviting so and so to my wedding\u201d is a different ask than \u201caita for cheating on my spouse on our wedding day\u201d", ">Weddings don\u2019t happen outside of relationships\n\nNo, but big parties do so I think that gets them a pass in certain situations.  There was a post the other day about someone's 40th birthday where they basically had a meal with a limited guest list followed by the after party which was open to more so there can be parallels.\n\nI'm not against the rules being reviewed though.  If good worthwhile posts are getting nuked (and that does happen sometimes) then it's always worth taking a look and tweaking things.", "> Businesses are not people. \n\nCitizens united would like a word.\n\n> Post restrictions are in place to keep the sub focused.\n\nFocused on what?\n\nI just posted a thread about a clear conflict I had with a person regarding break checking. It was removed for \"not having an interpersonal conflict\".\n\nWhat?", "You can probably report for rule 12 on most of those", "What's the point of disallowing either?", "Your post was removed because the people you were taking action against didn't communicate anything to you. Your coworker is a third party to the situation, which is covered in the text of rule 7. It was also removed for rule 8, as calling people Karen in a post is not presenting it fairly.\n\nThat post seems better suited for a rant or offmychest type of sub. Try r/findareddit to see what's out there.", "This sub is not here to debate the morality of brake-checking, which is what results when some unrelated third party calls you the AH.\n\nNow, if you had brake-checked, caused your passenger to spill their coffee, and they declared you an AH, that would have met the guidelines. (And before you go off and post that, remember that posts have to be truthful.)", "I think it\u2019s mostly to avoid becoming too much of an advice sub. People do it anyway but on posts where the relationship IS the conflict you\u2019ll have people telling op to break up/get a divorce when it\u2019s usually pretty subjective", "Relationship posts get extremely redundant and most have the same answer. \"Aita for breaking up with...\" Almost always no. \"Aita for wanting more help with money/children/chores\" are generally not isolated conflicts and just incompatibilities. \"Aita for wanting children...\" It's not a yes or no, it's differing options.\n\nIt's to cut down on topics that are really repetitive, generally always the same answer,vand can be better addressed in other subreddits.", "If they are redundant and boring then the user base will ignore them and they will fall off.\n\nI find a lot of mods have this issue. THEY get bored of certain topics because they are always here. But for normal posters, they are interesting topics.", "Curious how you found this out. I (most of us, actually) approve plenty of posts that would normally bore me to death. But they don't violate a sub rule, so I approve and move on.", "I've never seen a sub like this one with so many rules regarding relevant content.", "Oh there's so many of them. Often they're doing what we're doing, trying to fit into a specific niche rather than being overly broad. There's also tons of communities out there with less restrictive posting requirements. I tend to prefer subreddits that are more focused and less broad, and I know others that prefer the opposite. The great thing about reddit is all of these things can exist simultaneously.\n\nWe even created /r/AmItheButtface if you want a space that's less restrictive.", "There's a difference between being focused and being arbitrarily restrictive.", "I agree, and I don't think our posting rules are arbitrary at all. I also understand how it might not seem that way to someone who isn't spending as much time with them as I am. \n\nIf you're interested in learning more I encourage you to check out past open forums, where we spend time explaining why we have each rule that we do. [This should take you to a search](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/?f=flair_name%3A%22Open%20Forum%22) by flair to find all of the open forums. We didn't label the rule we were deep diving on until about a year ago, [but last December's open forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbqapd/aita_monthly_open_forum_december_2022/) has labels for those from 2022 at least.", "> Your post was removed because the people you were taking action against didn't communicate anything to you\n\nDid you read it? Half the post was about the dispute between my coworker and I?", "Why? I don't understand the point in having so many arbitrary restrictions.", "We read your post. Did you read your removal message, or any of the responses we've provided regarding why it was removed?  \n\n\n>Your coworker is a third party to the situation, which is covered in the text of rule 7. It was also removed for rule 8, as calling people Karen in a post is not presenting it fairly.", "Yes. 3 separate mods, at least, have read it now. All 3 of us agree that it breaks Rule 7. Your coworker is an uninvolved third party,  therefore their opinion does not make this a conflict.", "This sub has a specific purpose and the rules are there to keep it to that purpose. There are reasons for all those rules and they\u2019re pretty well explained in the FAQ and these monthly threads. You might want the sub to be something else, but the mods have a clear vision for what they want and intend to hold to it. And, by most measures, this vision has been quite successful.", "I don't think so. A lot of other redundant topics about attending weddings or criticizing baby names or doing a prank make it to the first page because the subreddit has a ton of people on it at different frequency levels.\n\nI think I made the mistake of you asking about why relationship topics weren't allowed but you seem to just want to argue they should be. I didn't make the rules. I'm just explaining what I think the logic was to them, and why I'm personally glad they get deleted.", "> Your coworker is an uninvolved third party\n\nUninvolved in an argument between myself and him.\n\nThat's an...interesting take.", "Well ya, you've banned everything that bores you.", "Unless you were brake checking your coworker who was sitting next to you in the car, then they are a third party because you didn't take an action against them.\n\nFrom the text of rule 7:\n\n> f your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, **or a third party who\u2019s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked**, your post will be removed.", "We genuinely give no thought whatsoever to how interesting a subject matter is. Relationship posts are banned specifically because we don't want to arbitrate whether people maintain relationships that they no longer wish to maintain. If you no longer wish to be friends with someone, no longer wish to date someone, no longer wish to maintain a relationship with your family...that's your choice. A bunch of buttholes on the internet shouldn't be part of that decision. \"Not dating someone\" isn't an issue in need of moral arbitration- we are not here to arbitrate matters of consent, and there's never going to be a situation where it's appropriate to weigh in on whether or not someone is obligated to maintain a relationship with someone.  \n\n\nEDIT: Also if we were allowed to ban things for being boring as fuck, I'd have personally banned \"Am I The Asshole for not disposing of my dog's shit properly\" posts by now.", "I\u2019ve only had bad experiences on this subreddit. I haven\u2019t posted on it, but from the comments I read most people don\u2019t even read the post and they just call the OP an asshole for part of their story, often a really small borderline irrelevant part.", "Which is why it's important to upvote comments that focus on the whole post, EVEN ONES YOU DON'T AGREE WITH. Downvote people who make a judgement with little to no support whatsoever", "Sometimes, I'll be reading a post and I'll come across a line that makes me go, \"all the comments are going to be about this piece, aren't they?\" And sure enough.", "Let's face it: nobody ever reads the rules before making their first post/comment.", "I really would like to know what was uncivil about the post that you removed.  The one about the baseball going in the neighbors yard.", "Most people don't read them at all. They're pretty well hidden on mobile, too, which is where most users are coming from. It's not reasonable to expect people to read them at this point. \n\nWhat's really interesting is how different this was compared to even four years when I started modding. We had a lot more users visiting on their browser, and importantly visiting in a way we could control to make the rules more visible. Go back 10 years and it was even more different. There's so many tangents to ramble on about this. Something something eternal september.", "The rules are a little wacky. I don't know any other sub that needs a monthly q&a just to explain what they are.", "Unfortunately most of the time people get downvoted if people disagree with them even tho it\u2019s against the rules, ESPECIALLY if the OP comments even if it\u2019s just adding context or details", "Reddit really should get around to fixing that on mobile, lol. Maybe linking to rules/FAQ before making your first post/comment or something", "We're supposed to upvote judgements that are reasonable and show the commenter actually read the post, regardless of whether or not we agree with the judgement. How does this work with the current system of the \"official\" judgement being the one with the most upvotes?   \n\nI can only speak for myself, but I feel like upvoting a comment is endorsing the judgement. Especially when the vote hasn't been decided yet. If I'm honest, I usually just upvote judgements I agree with that are well thought out. (I don't downvote stuff I disagree with though.)    \n\n What do other people think?"]}
