The report itself is 15 pages, far too long to include all of the explanation in this post.\n\nWe're still reviewing this as a team, and seeing what we have to learn. We'd love to hear your thoughts as well.", "created_utc": 1685714723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ydrba/aita_monthly_open_forum_june_2023_reddit_survey/", "score": 11, "replies": [">70.16% feel that people generally behave appropriately\n\nWell that's funny.", "I don't quite understand this sub. I made a profile to make a thread but after reading the rules it seems like just about every conceivable topic is not allowed here.\n\nThe front page is full of threads that are about relationships or work. Which is against the rules? Half the posts are about weddings. A wedding is not about a relationship? \n\nAnd sorting by new is an exercise in frustration as just about every thread you reply to gets locked.\n\nVery confused.", "The people that don't either post rule 11-banned posts, downvote comments they don't agree with, or argue with mods about civility.", "Since few people really read the rules, most don't even know what appropriate behavior is for this community.", "Sorry if this seems like a bit of a stupid question, but what does \"benchmark\" mean in this context?", ">The front page is full of threads that are about relationships or work. Which is against the rules?\n\nIt takes some getting used to when it comes to what stays and what gets deleted.  Even then, shitposts, accounts getting banned, not answering judgement bot etc still make posting in new a bit of a guessing game.\n\nWith relationships, it generally boils down to whether the issue could happen outside of a relationship.  Also, no partings so \"AITA for no longer being friends with....\" would be a rule break.  A lot of the issues that spring up from weddings could also occur at any particularly lavish bash in some variety.\n\nFor work, I think posts can (or at least should) pass that involve certain issues.  But \"AITA for leaving a job\" will be deleted as would \"AITA for not working a shift\" or \"AITA for asking for a pay rise\" etc...  If a conflict happens at work that could happen outside of a work situation then I think it's ok to stay.\n\nI'm not 100% on all of the above though.", "Ha, I meant to edit that into the copy and it slipped my mind! Here's the explanation from the report:\n\n>Note: Each statistic will include a benchmark. This benchmark is the average response for communities of similar size & activity to your community. \n\nThere were somewhere in the ballpark of 200 communities participating in this, so they had a pretty decent amount to compare to.", "Ah, I see. Thanks for the information. :)", "Sorting by new (which I most often do) is an education in how often people post without even thinking to read the rules as to what's appropriate. And, it's an education as to how people want to use this *very* popular sub and its amplification out to the larger world as a platform for their opinions. \n\nIf you do want to sort by new, the best thing you can do is become acquainted with the rules, think about them before responding, and report any post you think breaks the rules. \n\nAnd, no matter how careful you are, you will find yourself replying to a thread that got locked after you started to comment.  Reddit's user experience for that is really, really terrible and, if you're like me, will feel a bit silly for responding in the first place.", "What is the point of these restrictions?", "Weddings don\u2019t happen outside of relationships. I\u2019m fine with the rules but let\u2019s all agree they don\u2019t make sense lol", "We actually answer both in [our faq](https://www.reddit.com//r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\nFor Rule 11\n\n>* We're not here to arbitrate issues surrounding consent. You can date or not date whoever you like. You can be or not be attracted to whoever you like. You can be friends with or not be friends with whoever you like. This isn't something that requires moral arbitration. If you want to know if it's ok to ghost your former bestie or former soulmate, this isn't the place to ask.\n\nFor business conflicts:\n\n>* AITA's focus is on conflicts between people. Businesses are not people. A conflict with someone acting on behalf of a business is not an interpersonal conflict. \n\nBut overall, the sub has a specific purpose of judging actions that lead to an interpersonal conflict. Post restrictions are in place to keep the sub focused.", "There's other subs for those issues, and they're always the same and very boring. People asking \"AITA for calling out a bigot\" is getting up there too", "Wedding posts aren\u2019t about the relationships themselves though. Asking \u201caita for not inviting so and so to my wedding\u201d is a different ask than \u201caita for cheating on my spouse on our wedding day\u201d", ">Weddings don\u2019t happen outside of relationships\n\nNo, but big parties do so I think that gets them a pass in certain situations.  There was a post the other day about someone's 40th birthday where they basically had a meal with a limited guest list followed by the after party which was open to more so there can be parallels.\n\nI'm not against the rules being reviewed though.  If good worthwhile posts are getting nuked (and that does happen sometimes) then it's always worth taking a look and tweaking things.", "> Businesses are not people. \n\nCitizens united would like a word.\n\n> Post restrictions are in place to keep the sub focused.\n\nFocused on what?\n\nI just posted a thread about a clear conflict I had with a person regarding break checking. It was removed for \"not having an interpersonal conflict\".\n\nWhat?", "You can probably report for rule 12 on most of those", "What's the point of disallowing either?", "Your post was removed because the people you were taking action against didn't communicate anything to you. Your coworker is a third party to the situation, which is covered in the text of rule 7. It was also removed for rule 8, as calling people Karen in a post is not presenting it fairly.\n\nThat post seems better suited for a rant or offmychest type of sub. Try r/findareddit to see what's out there.", "This sub is not here to debate the morality of brake-checking, which is what results when some unrelated third party calls you the AH.\n\nNow, if you had brake-checked, caused your passenger to spill their coffee, and they declared you an AH, that would have met the guidelines. (And before you go off and post that, remember that posts have to be truthful.)", "I think it\u2019s mostly to avoid becoming too much of an advice sub. People do it anyway but on posts where the relationship IS the conflict you\u2019ll have people telling op to break up/get a divorce when it\u2019s usually pretty subjective", "Relationship posts get extremely redundant and most have the same answer. \"Aita for breaking up with...\" Almost always no. \"Aita for wanting more help with money/children/chores\" are generally not isolated conflicts and just incompatibilities. \"Aita for wanting children...\" It's not a yes or no, it's differing options.\n\nIt's to cut down on topics that are really repetitive, generally always the same answer,vand can be better addressed in other subreddits.", "If they are redundant and boring then the user base will ignore them and they will fall off.\n\nI find a lot of mods have this issue. THEY get bored of certain topics because they are always here. But for normal posters, they are interesting topics.", "Curious how you found this out. I (most of us, actually) approve plenty of posts that would normally bore me to death. But they don't violate a sub rule, so I approve and move on."]}
