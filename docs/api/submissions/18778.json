The report itself is 15 pages, far too long to include all of the explanation in this post.\n\nWe're still reviewing this as a team, and seeing what we have to learn. We'd love to hear your thoughts as well.", "created_utc": 1685714723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ydrba/aita_monthly_open_forum_june_2023_reddit_survey/", "score": 7, "replies": [">70.16% feel that people generally behave appropriately\n\nWell that's funny.", "I don't quite understand this sub. I made a profile to make a thread but after reading the rules it seems like just about every conceivable topic is not allowed here.\n\nThe front page is full of threads that are about relationships or work. Which is against the rules? Half the posts are about weddings. A wedding is not about a relationship? \n\nAnd sorting by new is an exercise in frustration as just about every thread you reply to gets locked.\n\nVery confused.", "The people that don't either post rule 11-banned posts, downvote comments they don't agree with, or argue with mods about civility.", "Since few people really read the rules, most don't even know what appropriate behavior is for this community.", "Sorry if this seems like a bit of a stupid question, but what does \"benchmark\" mean in this context?", ">The front page is full of threads that are about relationships or work. Which is against the rules?\n\nIt takes some getting used to when it comes to what stays and what gets deleted.  Even then, shitposts, accounts getting banned, not answering judgement bot etc still make posting in new a bit of a guessing game.\n\nWith relationships, it generally boils down to whether the issue could happen outside of a relationship.  Also, no partings so \"AITA for no longer being friends with....\" would be a rule break.  A lot of the issues that spring up from weddings could also occur at any particularly lavish bash in some variety.\n\nFor work, I think posts can (or at least should) pass that involve certain issues.  But \"AITA for leaving a job\" will be deleted as would \"AITA for not working a shift\" or \"AITA for asking for a pay rise\" etc...  If a conflict happens at work that could happen outside of a work situation then I think it's ok to stay.\n\nI'm not 100% on all of the above though.", "Ha, I meant to edit that into the copy and it slipped my mind! Here's the explanation from the report:\n\n>Note: Each statistic will include a benchmark. This benchmark is the average response for communities of similar size & activity to your community. \n\nThere were somewhere in the ballpark of 200 communities participating in this, so they had a pretty decent amount to compare to.", "Ah, I see. Thanks for the information. :)"]}
