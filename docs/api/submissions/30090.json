Avocado: Contains a substance called persin, which can be toxic in large amounts.\r  \n7.\tCaffeine: Found in coffee, tea, energy drinks, and some medications; can cause vomiting, diarrhea, increased heart rate, and seizures.\r  \n8.\tBones: Cooked bones can splinter and cause obstructions or punctures in the digestive tract.\r  \n9.\tFatty Foods: High-fat foods like bacon, sausage, and fried foods can lead to pancreatitis.\r  \n10.\tDairy Products: Some dogs are lactose intolerant and may experience digestive issues.\r  \n\n\nTier 3: Foods to Use Caution With\n\n 11.

Aspiration pneumonia is horrible and that's just the tip of the iceberg. It has to be done a specific way with a specific amount of peroxide.", "When my dog was a puppy my sister dropped a grape on the floor that rolled under the table. Dog got it before we could. I did some quick research about inducing vomiting at home and decided I didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it so we called an emergency vet who recommended we bring him in. I was hoping they\u2019d say one grape was unlikely to hurt him but it unfortunately is possible that one single grape can lead to death, even if it\u2019s not the most likely result. So we brought him in. They immediately induced vomiting, showed us the mostly intact grape in the contents of his stomach and also warned us against giving him bully sticks as a half of stick also came up in his vomit and the vet commented that she routinely had to perform emergency surgeries on dogs who swallowed bully sticks either whole or partially whole. $500 bill for inducing vomiting and packing him with fluids. But I have pet insurance on him and we got about $415 of it back.", "That's like dentistry. \"I can buy some pliers for $15 at Home Depot and pull it myself.\" Yeah sure, but if you break the root off in there you're SOL. You pay the dentist/oral surgeon to extract it to take care of any problems that might happen in the process.", "That's a very good point to bring up. For those who can afford the vet visit, taking your dog to have vomiting induced properly is the best course of action. Unfortunately, there are plenty of people who may not be able to afford that kind of sudden expense.", "hydrogen peroxide can also cause severe gastric ulcers. a vet hospital will induce vomiting with an injection of drugs instead.", "That doesn\u2019t make sense - the toxins in grapes are not allergens - they are toxins that cannot be metabolized by a dog and cause kidney damage.", "It's the tartaric acid concentration, so it's randomish in grapes, and the study was only done in the past year! \n\nhttps://www.cliniciansbrief.com/article/grape-raisin-toxicity-dogs-research", "\"a lot\" is an overstatement. its about 0.6-2% of the population have some peanut allergy. A much small percentage has extreme peanut allergies where one peanut is fatal. If I saw a kid eat a peanut I wouldn't rush them to the hospital if they had no symptoms. I'd watch closely if it was their first peanut and rush them to the hospital if any symptoms showed up. I feel like the same approach would be appropriate with dogs and grapes.", "Liver casserole with raisins sounds like a terrible joke.", "We had a lot of fruit trees,which  we rarely tended/harvested.\n\nOur golden retriever used to eat a lot of fruit, lol.  He preferred apple and plums.\n\nOf course he also had a route around the village for daily treats from neighbours.", "Our schnauzer has the most sensetive tummy. I think it stems from the fact he had giardia as a puppy and the vet was an idiot and kept telling us we had to give him stronger and stronger medicines to 'cure' him. This went on for nearly 4 months. Turns out giardia leaves a protein, so even when the dog passes it, the test will still show it for some time. He had no other symptoms after the first round of meds, but I thought surely the vet knew best. \n\nSecond opinion in desperation told us there was nothing wrong with the dog. Healthy as could be, but his tummy is fucked. Even a change in treats gives him the runs.", "My black lab ate three chocolate croissants once. Absolutely no reaction. He also ate half a kilo of uncooked lentils. Pooped them out for days!", "I read that last line as \"sometimes I wonder how I got him this fart\" and somehow for a boxer it works.", "Hey, thank you for understanding that my comment was less about the grape and more about the partnership and care for the dog. I appreciate it.", "This. It's sad this can happen but when money gets tight people put off all kinds of important things.", "Yes this but my point was largely about laying blame and using that as the reason to force the GF to pay for vet care. I hope that's not totally lost in the anecdote as it represents the majority of my comment.", "Yes, and I have done the math already and have written everything down and taped it to the peroxide bottle so I don\u2019t have to figure it out while under stress. I recommend this for everyone", "My dog got that from eating too many sticks and throwing up. It was heart breaking. She tried to lift her head to put on my lap and burst out coughing. Luckily she\u2019s 100% now", "jesus. our dogs only chew their bully sticks under supervision, but I have never seen them break a piece off/sticks splinter/ or swallow any pieces whole.\n\nthey're also scottish terriers so not very big. but those teeth and jaws, sheesh\n\nwe also don't give them small sticks, seems like a one-way ticket to choking", "It\u2019s a comparison to understand why some dogs can eat grapes and others can\u2019t, it\u2019s not a literal \u201cgrapes are to dogs what peanuts are to humans\u201d", "The vet poison centre in my country says that the toxic level is 10 to 50 grams per kilo (0.3 to 1.8 ounce per 2 pounds) depending on the dog, but to call the vet anyway if the dog has eaten some grape. Raisin is more dangerous as the toxin is concentrated.", "But those toxins are not even in every grape, the toxins vary, and some dogs CAN process SOME toxins", "The problem is that once they start showing symptoms their kidneys could already be damaged.", "it's not an allergen.  it's an intolerance.  Allergens affect the immune system, intolerances affect digestive system. In this case,  dogs cannot metabolize certain things in the grapes and those things build up in the kidneys. the damage occurs over time...usually, but sometimes it's more toxic.  In any case, it isn't helpful to compare it to allergens because it is completely dissimilar and affects completely different parts of the body in different ways.\n\nAlso, that's not really how anaphylaxis works either. My son is one of those with the severe allergy. The allergen can stay in the system for up to 72 hours, actually, but the reaction can vary and it can change suddenly, especially within the first 24 hours.  So, basically, you can think everything is fine, send everyone to bed and then find a dead child who choked in their sleep.  If you don't know what's up, don't fucking guess. Seek medical intervention.\n\nETA: this is specific to peanuts ingested via the mouth. other things are different.  again, why you seek medical intervention.", "Yep my lab would eat heaps of fruit, loved apricots. Would find the seeds scattered all over the lawn", "Practice how you give it too. If it's done wrong, it goes badly. Peroxide in the lungs destroys lung tissue.", "Overbreeding and inherent kidney issues  based on a lack of genetic diversity are the root cause as to why some dogs keel over after a single grape, or so many die aged 5 with bad kidneys. I've known dogs to eat entire huge boxes of belgian chocolate truffles and entire punnets of grapes (and lots of ther stuff thats bad for them) and they live full healthy lives."]}
