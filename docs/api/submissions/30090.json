If the dog is a rescue still doing vaccines, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s pretty young (so, small) based off the fact that the rescue I\u2019ve worked with generally would do all an older dog\u2019s shots before letting them get adopted. And of they\u2019re the dog\u2019s \u201cnew favorite treat\u201d then this probably wasn\u2019t just a stray grape that rolled on the floor, it might have been quite a few.", "Anything documented by your vet will not be covered by insurance. This is a known fact.", "Had a bassett hound that did the same. That  dog had an iron stomach. Didn't even have an upset stomach.", "Same!! Especially my yellow lab. Chocolate, grapes, berries off a tree (privet) that really made him uncomfortable, strong as an ox. Mind you we did have to pay to have an emergency operation after the stupid thing stole a corn cob out of the bin, weeks later the vet had to remove a tiny piece from his small intestine, we were always so so careful but just that one time he bested us! Man I miss my boys", "My dog was a lab mutt and ate an entire bar of dark chocolate one time. No reaction, she was completely fine. Wasn't even a huge dog, maybe like 50 lb.  What's up with those creatures", "15 year old Schnauzer girl has eaten everything. Chocolate,  grapes, onions, marshmallows,  cookies with God knows what in, magic mushrooms foraged from the top field, coffee and whiskey straight from people's glasses....\n\nWe do everything to stop her, but she's a devil. At 13.5 we figured she was the oldest one wr ever had so obviously knew what she was doing and relaxed a bit. Still going,  bit senile, bit arthritic,  eyes are going,  loving life retired on Dad and stepmums estate,  snuffing the breeze on the top field.\n\nVets have no idea why she's not combusted, healthiest dog we've had. Running theory is no one told her that she wasn't meant to be able tk eat these things....", "I just read this last year how dangerous corn cobs are! I\u2019m so thankful for Reddit because it was something I had never seen or heard of before. So glad none of mine ever got any.", "Right!? My current husky gets a nugget from McDonalds and gets the runs, but loves Chick-fil-A nugs.", "I mean, same so it's probably a McDonald's thing lmao"]}
