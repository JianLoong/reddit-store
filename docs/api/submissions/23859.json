We had a friendly little competition going on about whose name he would say first, \"mama\" or \"papa.\" I decided to playfully encourage him to say \"papa\" by repeating it whenever I was with him.\n\nHowever, my wife got upset when she found out what I was doing. She felt that I was trying to influence our son's first word and was taking away her chance to hear him say \"mama\" first. She thinks I should have let him say his first word naturally without any interference.\n\nI didn't mean to upset her, and I thought it was just a harmless game.\n\nAfter a few days of repeating \"papa\" around our son, he eventually did say it as his first word. My heart swelled with joy when he uttered it, but my wife's reaction was quite the opposite. She got immensely angry, and her disappointment was evident. She accused me of manipulating the situation and claimed that I had taken away a precious moment from her.\n\nI tried to explain that it was all meant to be a fun, innocent game, and I didn't think it would cause such a reaction. But she remained upset, insisting that I should have let our son's first word come naturally without any intervention.

She used it properly (after falling on a pretty hard floor while running) and all too!", "My toddler just learned \"cookie\" (maybe his 6th or 7th word). I mentioned the new word acquisition to my mom, and this happened.\n\nMom: oh no, now you'll have to give him cookies all the time!\n\nMe: actually, I don't think he knows it means a cookie. He has cookies so rarely, I'm not sure he knows what they're called. He says it to mean Cookie Monster.\n\nMom: oh, he's into Sesame Street now?\n\nMe: well, not really, he doesn't watch TV. He just has a stuffed Cookie Monster toy and this Sesame Street sing-along book with a little guitar, and he loves when (his dad) sings the songs in a Cookie Monster voice, so he started saying \"cookie\" to ask for that.\n\nMom: wow, you're a mean mom!", "It sounds horrifying to have a baby screeching like a seagull, your poor parents.

There are always exceptions to the established norm.", "My baby knows a lot of real signs but she started inventing signs when she can\u2019t figure out the words she needs to use. like before i taught her sleep, she would pantomime rocking a baby when she wanted to go to bed \ud83e\udd79", "I am absolutely astonished to see all the nta judgements.   Turning anything regarding baby in to a competition is an asshole move.  She pushed out the baby, does the majority of work for the baby and now gets to feel like Dada will get all the rewards.", "Being disappointed is fine. The fact of the matter is mother\u2019s generally give up more of their life to babies at this age. It will even out eventually but if baby breastfeeds Dad can\u2019t help with that, many places do not offer any paternity leave etc. It is perfectly acceptable to be a little disappointed that this tiny being that your entire world revolves around said Dada first. What isn\u2019t acceptable is getting mad over it.", "It's not about unilateral decision for me. It's about not respecting the partner. My husband has multiple things he's not OK with (some regarding our son) so I don't do them. Cause I love him and I don't want upset him.

Yeah stop being ignorant and use context clues.", "Again, the only one with an ego is her, evident by her reaction.
