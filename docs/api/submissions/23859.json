We had a friendly little competition going on about whose name he would say first, \"mama\" or \"papa.\" I decided to playfully encourage him to say \"papa\" by repeating it whenever I was with him.\n\nHowever, my wife got upset when she found out what I was doing. She felt that I was trying to influence our son's first word and was taking away her chance to hear him say \"mama\" first. She thinks I should have let him say his first word naturally without any interference.\n\nI didn't mean to upset her, and I thought it was just a harmless game.\n\nAfter a few days of repeating \"papa\" around our son, he eventually did say it as his first word. My heart swelled with joy when he uttered it, but my wife's reaction was quite the opposite. She got immensely angry, and her disappointment was evident. She accused me of manipulating the situation and claimed that I had taken away a precious moment from her.\n\nI tried to explain that it was all meant to be a fun, innocent game, and I didn't think it would cause such a reaction. But she remained upset, insisting that I should have let our son's first word come naturally without any intervention.

If she's the one spending most of the time with the child, him doing this on purpose is pulling a Disney Dad.", "Ours mispronounced \u201ctruck\u201d in a similar way.", "This is factually incorrect, but yeah.", "Babies aren\u2019t that deep \ud83e\udd23 Babies say the da and pa sounds sooner because they\u2019re easier than ma sounds.", "I took my baby's first word seriously as in I was seriously excited when she started saying dada And it was clear she was referring to her father. No infant says \"mama\" first because \"m\" is a difficult sound to master.\n\nPlus the whole...babies are never going to say a word no one teaches them.", "What ! That's bonkers", "11 months and a half old, does that matter?", "He is a newborn so like under 28 days or up to 3 months of age", "Idk how true this is but I have also read that in addition to dada or papa being easier to say that due to the mothers physically carrying the child for 9 months then typically being the primary caregiver in the first months due to breastfeeding and likelihood of actually having maternity leave (if in the US) that the baby feels the mom as itself. This leaves the dad as a \u201cseparate\u201d being and having a different \u201cname\u201d while mom is one with baby. It will take longer for the baby to feel separate from mom and give her her name. Again, I do not know how true this is but I found it an interesting take.", "That is so damn cute! I'm so excited for when my nephew says his first word. We're all laying bets it's gonna be the F bomb, given he's living on a working farm in Australia. That or the C bomb. Either way, we'll be so proud, lol.", "Pretty much. My mom doesn't remember my first word, but she does remember I asked \"why?\" a **lot**. I always wanted more information. Why does this happen? What does that do this? Why?", "My first \"word\" at 11 months was an uncanny imitation of seagull calls picked up from a visit to the beach. I then went on to imitate every animal noise I encountered - we lived in farm & woodland country, so that was a LOT. I didn't appear interested in learning actual human words.\n\nMy parents were concerned for quite some time.", "Yes my second baby made her own gestures for things !", "And as the important thing is any of their experiences. I cannot stand selfish parents. They both should just care about the development of their son.", "What\u2019s more important, raising your baby in a healthy, sensible way, or worrying about your adult wife\u2019s fee fees?", "Yes, she\u2019s being childish.", "She should be doing it too!", "The mom I was talking about was pregnant, gave birth, and then breastfed and felt they were more entitled to the babies love over the father who they felt didn\u2019t do as much for the baby. Still horrible thought process but im saying it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard of a mom being mad. She should just be happy her lil angel is starting to babble", "Yes, it matters, because he's not a newborn. You said newborn, we think tiny infant, and we think this bloke's deluded if he thinks his newborn is speaking.", "You think tiny infant, I think of a baby. Stop expecting everyone to cater their speech to you and do some critical thinking.", "Newborn means newly born, not nearly a year old."]}
