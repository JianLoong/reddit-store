Telling someone they can't tell their spouse something is an AH move, if FiL wanted financial advice without his daughter knowing, he should find a financial advisor who is not her husband.", "The other siblings would surely not react as well as my wife to this news, so I assume he\u2019d trying to avoid hurt feelings. \n\nHe and his wife have their finances totally separate. Like zero joint accounts or cards. So I think financial secrecy is as second nature to him as it would be a Swiss banker. I\u2019m not condoning it. Just more context I didn\u2019t put in my already long opening post.", "NTA. \n\nSo, my first question, although yes you work in finance, he could have gone to any other person to ask for this advise. Why did he have to tell you a secret, that you purposely have to keep from your wife/his daughter? I appreciate you were trying to help & didn't know what the proposition was going to entail when you agreed to assist with his finances. I also don't blame you for not telling your wife, so far. \n\nWhat I propose is you go back to him & tell him that he has put you in an unfair position. Explain that you have never wanted his money & nor has your wife. How it upsets you that he doesn't know the character of his own daughter enough to know she would be understanding that he wants to help her siblings more, as clearly they have always supported them financially more anyway! But, (& I would not normally suggest this is most circumstances) you give him the ultimatum of either he tells her, or yoy do. \n\nI don't think its fair for you to have to keep this secret from your wife. But, it's also not fair for you to have to break the news. The worst part of all of this is it sounds like yourself & your wife would be very understanding & the way he has dealt with it has caused a lot more upset than was needed!", "NTA. It\u2019s not ok to ask someone to keep a secret from their spouse. FIL shouldn\u2019t ever have involved you\u2014he should have paid someone outside the family to advise him.\n\nWhat you should do though, is give FIL a chance to tell his daughter himself. Only tell her if he won\u2019t. Then you\u2019re not betraying his trust, because you\u2019re forewarning him. But try to stay out of the middle if you can.", "YWNBTA\n\nTell your wife, she's gonna find out if he gives the money to sibling and then you're gonna look like the ah for keeping secrets from her. Just my opinion.", "YWBTA. What is need to tell your wife something you know will upset her for no good reason other than to unburden yourself? You don\u2019t make others feel bad in order to make yourself feel better.", "was your FIL straight up with you from the start that he needed help and did not want you to discuss with your wife, or was this after the fact? \nAfter the fact, you should discuss with him to tell your wife.\nIf you went into it willing to help knowing the conditions, then you should keep it to yourself.", "YWBTA.  What are you hoping to gain?", "YWNBTA. There\u2019s no secrets in marriage unless it\u2019s for a good surprise. If someone tells me to keep something secret from my husband that might concern him at all, I would say \u201cplease don\u2019t expect me to keep secrets in my marriage\u201d so if spouse can\u2019t know, don\u2019t tell me either.", "You're stuffed no matter how this plays out. You need to go back to FIL and tell him it was wrong of him to do this too you and that he needs to come clean to everyone in the family before you do it for him. Has your FIL told his wife? What's with all the secrecy?", "FIL is always the AH if he expects you to keep secrets from your wife / his daughter. That\u2019s messed.", "NTA. It's not good to keep things from your spouse. Imagine how she would feel if she finds out and that you never told her. She would feel betrayed.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of games is this man playing????\n\nTell your fil NOT to share secrets with you.  It compromises your relationship with your wife and you won't be a party to it.\n\nLet him know, if he doesn't tell your wife about the cash to her sibling, you WILL.\n\nGood Luck", "YWNBTA - It was deeply unfair of him to come to you specifically for this advice and to ask that you keep it a secret from your wife. He might not realise it but it is.\n\nYour loyalty seems to be with your wife and it should be in this instance. However, I would be tempted to say to him that you aren't comfortable with keeping secrets from her and if he does want free financial advice from you that affects your wife, you are going to share it with her.", "INFO: Are you a CFA/CFP?  I ask because you mention you are in finance, but I'm guessing you aren't in a field that requires you to be certified, because then you would know you are bound by client privilege.\n\nIf you are bound to keep your silence, then you WBTA.\n\nYour father-in-law is TA. He has put you in an impossible position of choosing between loyalty to your wife and your integrity. He also doesn't treat his children equally, and that's a shame. He obviously knows it's wrong, or else he wouldn't be asking you to keep it a secret.\n\nIf your wife found out later that you knew and you didn't tell her, how would that go down? \n\nI'm a big believer in keeping promises,  but it really depends on how your father-in-law approached this. Did he just spring it on you and then say, \"oh but don't tell your wife?\"  If so, too bad pops. You don't get to spring something like that on someone and then try to bind them to secrecy.\n\n I don't think you would be the asshole either way in the situation, because you are trying to maintain a promise to your father-in-law and spare your wife her feelings.  Her knowing the truth wouldn't change anything either way.  However, your father-in-law put you in an unfair position and your first loyalty really should be to your spouse, so I could understand why you would tell her.", "Honestly, YWBTAH if you didn\u2019t tell your wife.  She\u2019s your wife, your life partner, your best friend.  If you don\u2019t tell her and she finds out\u2026that\u2019s going to cause issues in your relationship.", "[deleted]", "ESH. He shouldn\u2019t have asked you to keep it a secret, and you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to. \n\nWhen my niece told me she had \u201csomething\u201d to tell me but I could t tell her parents, I immediately interrupted her to say \u201cdon\u2019t tell me, I\u2019m not going to keep secrets from your parents. Anything you tell me is fair game for me to tell them\u201d \n\nI assume his request caught you off-guard! \n\nYou should obvi tell your wife, perhaps she can keep your secret.", "NTA. If he wanted financial advice that wouldn't get back to his other kids he should have *paid* for it. When you ask family to help, especially in-laws, the unwritten rule is there is no confidentiality unless it is legally enforced. He wanted advice that he *knew* would be problematic. That's why he asked you to keep it secret, because he knows/feels like he's doing something wrong.\n\nYour wife's dad is an AH for ever asking you to keep a secret from your wife, and he's double the AH for getting large sums of money involved in your personal relationships. It's about the secret itself, not about whether what they want to do with their money is right or wrong.\n\nYou owe your father-in-law nothing, but you owe your wife honesty and fidelity. If you feel like it you could tell him that you've thought on it and you don't feel right keeping secrets from your wife so it's a heads up that you're telling her. But you could just tell her anyway.", "YWNBTA. Tell your wife because she will find out the truth and your relationship will be in jeopardy. In no way will she trust you again. It\u2019s unfortunate that your FIL doesn\u2019t treat his children equally and is WILLING to jeopardize your marriage and his relationship with you. Even though you have the credentials and he isn\u2019t a client, there is no client confidentiality as there was no payment or agreement created and documented. Sit down with her and tell her what happened, calm her down and come up with a plan together on next steps for handling this situation. If you both need to distance yourself from FIL and MIL so be it. She doesn\u2019t like secret dealings so you know what you need to do. Her family is toxic!", "NTA, tell her, \n\nHowever you need to work with her to not let on she knows: 1) FIL isn\u2019t going to not do it just cuz other siblings know. As you pointed out it will probably start a family war. 2) you now have a layer of trust with FIL and there might be more interesting info to come across and you don\u2019t want to burn that bridge considering #1. 3) there might be something in it for both down the road for being trustworthy 4) there may be another time where springing her knowledge of this could be strategically more valuable", "NTA, she\u2019s your wife, she\u2019s clearly got an issue with the secrets, not the money itself, which is fair. \n\nThey\u2019re not necessarily intending to, but it very much feels like they\u2019re implying that if she knew, she\u2019d be childish about one being \u201cfavoured\u201d, but I think you\u2019re right, you guys don\u2019t *need* it, so it\u2019d be somewhat \u201cwasted\u201d. \n\nI\u2019d be telling her, you married her, not her father, and if she finds out you knew and didn\u2019t tell her, you\u2019re part of the secret dealings.\n\nYou should also never tell someone not to tell their spouse something, that\u2019s pretty tacky.", "It's not right for you to have that kind of secret between you and FIL.
