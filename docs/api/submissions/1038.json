If that is the case, then your wife is an A.  If not, then you are the A.  It does not hurt to let a child child know they will get help in a moment if there is no distress in the situation.  She is using her words to let the child know she will indeed help, but they need to wait a moment.  She is teaching the child to understand that not everything is urgent, that the child can wait for a moment before getting help without it being a problem.  She is teaching your child patience.  This is borderline, \"she will say I will only help if you do this this and this for me.\"  Once again, INFO: is she saying I will get the toys out for you as long as you pick them up?  Again, not the A.  That is an entirely reasonable thing to say to a toddler.  Parents do that all the time.  It is called training your kids to become decent human beings.  \"I will take you to the store with me if you do not grab things off the shelf.\"  \"We can go the toy store, but you can only get one thing and it needs to be under $10.\"  Unless she is saying I will get the toys for you if you get me a beer out of the fridge, then I'd have some issues.", "I definitely need more information. It's perfectly healthy for your toddler to learn they don't get everything immediately and they need to wait for things. Unless it's an emergency there's no need for your wife to jump up immediately.

If that's what she's doing, there's nothing wrong with it.", "There's not a lot to go on here but the examples you give don't sound that bad.  I think its reasonable to allow a parent a couple of minutes to finish what they're doing before jumping to the attention of anyone. As a mother I get no time to myself and I often have to tell my kids to wait whilst I finish my first drink of the day... at lunchtime, they need to learn that I also have basic needs and without these I can't help anyone!  Toddlers are also the perfect age to start learning independence and how to help with chores so its perfectly reasonable to cook them dinner but then ask them to help to wash up. Its an important lesson to teach.  The only time I'd say this wouldn't be appropriate is when your toddler is upset or hurt, then you drop everything to help.\nAnd if you're watching all this happen then why don't you help out the toddler instead?\n\nNTA but need more info or examples.", "NTA. Personally I don't see much wrong with \"yes mommy will help after I'm done with this task\" (like sending a text) but other than that it's weird and manipulative to tell a 3 year old they \"owe\" their parents something for helping them.", "NAH? Your story doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  \n\nWife is helping child but sometimes asks the child to wait until she is finished a task she was already doing.  That seems pretty normal... Children have to practice waiting and it's a bad habit to drop everything every time they ask (except of course if it's a safety issue or emergency).\n\nWife sometimes tells toddler I will help you do X if you can help me with Y.  Unless what she's asking the toddler to do is wildly age-inappropriate I don't see that it's a huge problem.  ie. \"Okay sweetie mommy will help you do up your buttons but I need to you put your socks on yourself\"  or \"Ok mommy will help you build your puzzle, but first I need you to put your stuffed toys away\"", "NTA\n\nOutside of the transactional nature of her view on interactions with others...\n\n>Our toddler can do it herself or wait\n\nNo...

She is sending your child on a positive path. \nChildren learn at a young age how to manipulate their parents. Maybe mom has a friend or family member whose child is suffering because a parent does every little thing for them and jumps the very second the child says to jump.\nEverything is about balance \nYou can't ignore a kid, but you also want the child to grow up to be an independent adult who realizes life isn't about I start gratification.", "NTA but does your wife hate her child?", "**NTA**\n\nThe word you're looking for is \"transactional\", and you're right, parents should absolutely never have a transactional relationship with their child, because parents have not only a moral and ethical but a LEGAL obligation to care for their child's needs. A child, on the other hand, does not owe their parents any such thing; particularly a toddler.\n\nWhat your wife is doing, telling your barely-out-of-babyhood child that she requires reciprocation for anything that she does for her, isn't just disgusting (though it is certainly that), it indicates a profoundly worrisome psychological perspective on the part of your wife. Expecting to have a transactional relationship removes any emotion from the relationship - it would be a cold and unsympathetic way to approach a friendship with a peer . . . as an approach to parenting a small child, it is absolutely disturbing. Does your wife have no maternal instinct? No emotional understanding of her child's vulnerability and developmental stage that requires her assistance as a guide and nurturer? \n\nHonestly, this isn't just a little problematic, it's kind of huge.

A relationship with your children is not transactional, it is not trading favors; It is her *job* to care for and assist this child, end of. *Especially* with a toddler.  \n\n\nIt's okay for her to tell the child to wait until after she finishes doing something (if that something won't take long, and presuming the kid doesn't need help with anything serious), but instilling the idea in her that her mother won't help her unless she does something for her mother in return? That's setting your kid up for some major issues later in life, and will likely cultivate a really bad relationship between her and her mother.  \n\n\nIf she keeps on like this, your wife is going wake up one day wondering why your daughter doesn't trust, rely on, or want much of anything to do with her.", "NTA\n\nKeep this women away from any child!\n\nShe is really damaging her if the teach her, parents are people who only helps you, if you pay in any way for it.", "NTA and this is just weird behavior for a mother.", "NTA.

They shouldn't demand immediate attention from their parents for every little thing. It's okay to tell a child *Just a moment, mommy's on the phone.* \n\nAlso, it's not a bad thing to teach your child how to negotiate for the things that they want.

Within reason of course, on a sliding scale of how important the request is. Parents do NOT have to drop everything the second their child asks them for something. My mother certainly didn't, and it didn't traumatize me, it taught me that it's polite and reasonable to let someone finish what they're in the middle of if they wish to do so. If you don't teach them this, you're teaching them the opposite, that they should expect you to always drop everything immediately.\n\nThe wording you used regarding what your wife said suggests the task was something the child should be learning to do for themselves. Assuming that is true, then providing a delay can also help encourage the child to take on the task themselves. \n\nI think it's also pretty normal to teach exchanges in some situations with kids.

My 6 year old has a terrible time with patience and not constantly being entertained because she wasn't made to wait often enough. \n\nI work for a preschool and as I'm typing this i am listening to 2 year olds playing outside and having to wait for the teacher to finish with one student before turning their attention to the next one. They are being patient, your kid can be too.", "What is the wife expecting from your toddler? Like what is she expecting your toddler to do for her?", "You do realize that what your wife is doing is called parenting, right ?", "EXACTLY. It sounds like OP is just watching her get bombarded with requests and then gets upset with her for not fulfilling them immediately, all while he's sitting right tf there.", "Really? No parent should ever say \"sorry, hun, that'll have to wait until after school?\" Or \"sorry, cutie, but mom has to poop immediately\"? You know parents are also humans right?", "Sounds like she's trying to get the child to get used to going to the bathroom by herself. That is normal, although  it depends on how she said it. \"You have to leave mummy alone for the rest of the night\" can mean \"you need to try to go to the toilet by yourself before asking me for help\" or it can actually genuinely mean that the child shouldn't talk to her again for the rest of the day. One is a problem, one is not.", "So, your mother wasn\u2019t around. Sorry this happened to you. But whoever mothered you, didn\u2019t do a great job with you, if you think a parent needs to serve a child 24/7. Someone was overcompensating for you and it\u2019s not healthy. Proof? Your attitude now, towards your wife, who sounds like an amazing mom. Learn from her and be a better parent. Still YTA", "I haven\u2019t heard of this book but I just screenshotted this and want to get a copy now. I don\u2019t have kids but I have nieces and nephews that I watch a lot and think this could be really helpful! Thanks!", "Appreciated", "Such as going to the toilet, getting a drinks, help with an activity she is struggling with, getting  dressed. I guess the general things kids ask for", "I do step in but I also mindful that I don't want to undermine my wife infront of our child which is why I'm seeking perspective on this issue", "People can be very different around there children and act in a completely different way to which they deal with adults, I know this from experience. I probably didn't consider she would be so transactional with a child as an adult", "I think the \"in a minute\" isn't as bad as the \"I'll help you, but only if you do XYZ for me\". There are a handful of scenarios where that might be appropriate, but things like going to the bathroom, getting dressed, etc, shouldn't be transactional. It's appropriate for kids to ask for help with tasks they haven't mastered, they shouldn't have to \"earn\" that help.", "Apologies I'm dyslexic and not a great writer will try to add more context", "Or she could make sure the kid is taken care of first. In the post Op says she won't do anything unless she gets something in return, which is not about basic needs. This is her kid, I seems like the least she can do is make sure they're okay before herself. I understand you have different views so agree to disagree.", "Op said in one of their comments that eating and going to the bathroom is the issue.", "One of the examples given by OP was needing to use the bathroom. Who would reply with \"Yeah, mommy just has to finish this WhatsApp message real quick.\". Another example was getting food. \"Yes, of course you can have something to eat. But you have to do XYZ in return.\" That's strange.\n\nI don't think OP expects his wife to instantly get up and stop everything she's doing if their toddler asks for a toy or something like that.", "Uhhhh it's poor parenting at best probably closer to neglect", "It seems like the post says conditional on the fact that the wife had to get something in return. What is the toddler gonna do in return for their mother? Its okay for a parent to have this mindset?", "Sorry could you clarify what you mean by my attitude to my wife. Other than this point have I been disrespectful to her", "And you kid can wait a minute or a few minutes for all of that ? She has to get everything right away like a princess ?", "Why do you think your wife's feelings of authority are more important than helping a struggling toddler?\n\nIn any event, we need you to type out an actual dialog that these two have had that you disagree with.", "Okay, well that was a mistake. Don't make that mistake again. Talk to her about things and make agreements before these issues come up. Don't just assume that it's going to be okay. Just because other people do things well doesn't mean that your wife will. As proven by this entire situation.", "I am very curious about what the \"XYZ\" OP says his wife is asking for actually is.", "If you use word it will do spellcheck for you. I'm also not good with writing or spelling.", "He said that as background bit it wasn't really shown in relation to the child in the post. At least not in a concerning way. Like I said I made my decision based \n on the information in the post. It's not like she was saying I'll only help her if you do something for me.", "I think people forget that 3 year old are a lot more capable than a toddler. This is a preschooler, not a toddler. Maybe the mom understands what the child is capable of doing on their own and is encouraging some independence. \n\nAlways two sides to a story.", "Asking your kid to wait one minute while you finish something is not neglect.", "Did you not read the post at all or just the title? All the examples are \"I will do ABC for you after I finish XYZ for me\". No one is using the word \"conditional\" in the way you are trying to.", "I mean when a kids gotta use the bathroom you shouldn't make them hold it so you can send a whatsapp.", "Toddlers literally don't have enough physical control over their bladder and bowels at that age to be able to reliably wait a few minutes to use the bathroom.", "Maybe not with the toilet thing. Many kids have problems waiting for that.", "Because its a balance, I also don't want my daughter to grow up thinking its okay to be disrespected and that as a man I have any more or any less authority, ultimately my wife is someone I also respect which is why this is so hard.", "I get your point but hindsight is wonderful, we talked over so many things any sensible people going into parenting should and whilst as your point out mistakingly we missed that specific trait please don't assume we were idiots. I have asked because it has carried over an I am trying to get perspective on ths point", "That is what the post said though. The wife would help on the condition her toddler helps her.", "The point isn\u2019t making him wait it\u2019s only helping if he does something for her in return", "\"If she does help she will say I will only help if you do this or this for me.\" Did you read the post? Sounds like a condition to me.", "So that's one thing to correct but maybe it just happened once. OP doesn't say what his wife was doing when the kid asked to go to the bathroom. In fact, he doesn't give a lot a concrete examples. He just makes lists without context.", "But a 3yo should be able to get to the bathroom in their own home. I\u2019m thinking OP might be spoiling and helicoptering the kid.", "Great.  Again, give us an actual dialog between the two of them so we can give you the answer you're looking for.", "Okay, well it sounds like you get it. So moving on, your wife is not only treating your kid like shit, but she's also dismissing you. She's dismissing your concerns as a parent. That really isn't okay. So that's an extra bad thing on top of the original bad thing. I think that you need to continue to talk to her about this, and if she won't listen then suggest some couples therapy. She can't just shut you down every time that you have a concern about your child's well-being.", "I'll admit I missed that part when reading. But I don't know what she is asking her to do. This age is around the age that children start learning to be independent. If she is asking her to do something for herself like brushing her teeth then that wouldn't be bad. If it's something else then it could be. An example wasn't clearly stated in the post so I'm not going to speak on that.", "But there's no context here.\n\nIf she says \"I'll help you go to the bathroom if you go get me a cookie\", OP needs to get a divorce and to ask for full custody.\n\nIf she says \"I'll color with you if you put your toys away\", I don't see the big deal.\n\nOP is not telling us everything and that makes me think that he just wants his wife to be the asshole because she's not parenting the way he wants her to parent. If he gives me 2 concrete examples of his wife's behaviour, then I'm with him.", "And? Parents negotiate all the time. The post doesn't mention what kind of requests those are tied to. What if they're all for candy or some other \"treat\" and Mom is saying she'll do it in exchange for help with chores? Seems both a reasonable and commonplace exchange. Parents aren't supposed to be yes men.", "That could be something like \u201cI\u2019ll fix this toy for you, but only if you massage my feet for me.\u201d But there is an equal chance it\u2019s something like \u201cI\u2019ll take you to buy that new costume you want, but you have to clean your toys up first.\u201d It\u2019s worded too vaguely to make the assumptions you\u2019re making.", "So an example would be my child has recently toilet trained yesterday evening she went to my wife and asked for help to go to the toilet, she even said she couldn't hold it anymore and would pee her pants, my wife's response was I'm busy at the moment I Will finish this cup of coffee, my child insisted she would pee there and then so my wife said okay I will take you but then you have to leave mummy alone for the rest of the night...", "Makes sense, if Op clarifies what type of examples then a proper judgment can be made.", "\"Going to the toilet, getting dressed, getting food, activities she is struggling with\"\n\nOp said these are the things their kid asks for help with. I guess you're totally right then. Asking your mom as a toddler for help going to the bathroom and eating is totatly selfish, and the child should be willing to negotiate.", "Op stated in one of their comments the kid asks for help going to the bathroom, eating, and getting dressed. I think that these are basic needs for a parent to help with.", "Ok perfect.  That's child abuse, and you should absolutely be 'undermining' your wife on matters like this.", "That's why I suggested that they edit to add context", "But what is mom saying toddler needs to do in return?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you use the potty in a moment sweetie but I\u2019m in the middle of cooking, go grab your clean trainers for me and I\u2019ll meet you in the bathroom in a minute.\u201d Fits what OP is describing, but is reasonable parenting. \u201cI\u2019ll help you use the potty but you need to go get me a drink after\u201d also fits, but isn\u2019t reasonable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll break the potato up for you, but you have to try using your (toddler safe) utensils yourself for me first, okay?\u201d Fits OPs vague description, but is entirely reasonable parenting because you need to get your kids to actually try doing these things themselves. \u201cI\u2019ll cut up your potato for you, but you have to clean mommies room if I do\u201d would also still fit, but is extremely unreasonable."]}
