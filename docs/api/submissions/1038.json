If that is the case, then your wife is an A.  If not, then you are the A.  It does not hurt to let a child child know they will get help in a moment if there is no distress in the situation.  She is using her words to let the child know she will indeed help, but they need to wait a moment.  She is teaching the child to understand that not everything is urgent, that the child can wait for a moment before getting help without it being a problem.  She is teaching your child patience.  This is borderline, \"she will say I will only help if you do this this and this for me.\"  Once again, INFO: is she saying I will get the toys out for you as long as you pick them up?  Again, not the A.  That is an entirely reasonable thing to say to a toddler.  Parents do that all the time.  It is called training your kids to become decent human beings.  \"I will take you to the store with me if you do not grab things off the shelf.\"  \"We can go the toy store, but you can only get one thing and it needs to be under $10.\"  Unless she is saying I will get the toys for you if you get me a beer out of the fridge, then I'd have some issues.", "I definitely need more information. It's perfectly healthy for your toddler to learn they don't get everything immediately and they need to wait for things. Unless it's an emergency there's no need for your wife to jump up immediately. She can finish her text or drink. Also, as teachers we use a lot of first-then phrases. E.g. first you clean up your toys then you can do ________. If that's what she's doing, there's nothing wrong with it.", "There's not a lot to go on here but the examples you give don't sound that bad.  I think its reasonable to allow a parent a couple of minutes to finish what they're doing before jumping to the attention of anyone. As a mother I get no time to myself and I often have to tell my kids to wait whilst I finish my first drink of the day... at lunchtime, they need to learn that I also have basic needs and without these I can't help anyone!  Toddlers are also the perfect age to start learning independence and how to help with chores so its perfectly reasonable to cook them dinner but then ask them to help to wash up. Its an important lesson to teach.  The only time I'd say this wouldn't be appropriate is when your toddler is upset or hurt, then you drop everything to help.\nAnd if you're watching all this happen then why don't you help out the toddler instead?\n\nNTA but need more info or examples.", "NTA. Personally I don't see much wrong with \"yes mommy will help after I'm done with this task\" (like sending a text) but other than that it's weird and manipulative to tell a 3 year old they \"owe\" their parents something for helping them.", "NAH? Your story doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  \n\nWife is helping child but sometimes asks the child to wait until she is finished a task she was already doing.  That seems pretty normal... Children have to practice waiting and it's a bad habit to drop everything every time they ask (except of course if it's a safety issue or emergency).\n\nWife sometimes tells toddler I will help you do X if you can help me with Y.  Unless what she's asking the toddler to do is wildly age-inappropriate I don't see that it's a huge problem.  ie. \"Okay sweetie mommy will help you do up your buttons but I need to you put your socks on yourself\"  or \"Ok mommy will help you build your puzzle, but first I need you to put your stuffed toys away\"", "NTA\n\nOutside of the transactional nature of her view on interactions with others...\n\n>Our toddler can do it herself or wait\n\nNo... That's not what toddlers are. They can't do a lot of things by themselves, and while you don't want to create a situation where the toddler gets whatever they want, whenever they want, they do require more attention that someone whose mind and body is more fully formed.", "NTA, but you're married to one.", "It feels like there's a lot of info missing here, but I don't know exactly what to ask for.\n\n\nBased on this post, I'll say NTA, but a hollow NTA since I feel like we're missing something", "INFO: Which kind of help are we talking about?

She is sending your child on a positive path. \nChildren learn at a young age how to manipulate their parents. Maybe mom has a friend or family member whose child is suffering because a parent does every little thing for them and jumps the very second the child says to jump.\nEverything is about balance \nYou can't ignore a kid, but you also want the child to grow up to be an independent adult who realizes life isn't about I start gratification.", "NTA but does your wife hate her child?", "**NTA**\n\nThe word you're looking for is \"transactional\", and you're right, parents should absolutely never have a transactional relationship with their child, because parents have not only a moral and ethical but a LEGAL obligation to care for their child's needs. A child, on the other hand, does not owe their parents any such thing; particularly a toddler.\n\nWhat your wife is doing, telling your barely-out-of-babyhood child that she requires reciprocation for anything that she does for her, isn't just disgusting (though it is certainly that), it indicates a profoundly worrisome psychological perspective on the part of your wife. Expecting to have a transactional relationship removes any emotion from the relationship - it would be a cold and unsympathetic way to approach a friendship with a peer . . . as an approach to parenting a small child, it is absolutely disturbing. Does your wife have no maternal instinct? No emotional understanding of her child's vulnerability and developmental stage that requires her assistance as a guide and nurturer? \n\nHonestly, this isn't just a little problematic, it's kind of huge. I would be legit worried about parenting with someone who thinks that helping a toddler should be a transactional situation.

A relationship with your children is not transactional, it is not trading favors; It is her *job* to care for and assist this child, end of. *Especially* with a toddler.  \n\n\nIt's okay for her to tell the child to wait until after she finishes doing something (if that something won't take long, and presuming the kid doesn't need help with anything serious), but instilling the idea in her that her mother won't help her unless she does something for her mother in return? That's setting your kid up for some major issues later in life, and will likely cultivate a really bad relationship between her and her mother.  \n\n\nIf she keeps on like this, your wife is going wake up one day wondering why your daughter doesn't trust, rely on, or want much of anything to do with her.", "NTA\n\nKeep this women away from any child!\n\nShe is really damaging her if the teach her, parents are people who only helps you, if you pay in any way for it.", "NTA and this is just weird behavior for a mother.", "NTA.

It's all they know how to respond with.\n\nThat said, yer maybe tell your wife to knock it off else the kids going to think every action needs to have a cost.

They shouldn't demand immediate attention from their parents for every little thing. It's okay to tell a child *Just a moment, mommy's on the phone.* \n\nAlso, it's not a bad thing to teach your child how to negotiate for the things that they want.

You seem to be talking about two different things: 1) requesting something in return, and 2) requesting for the child to wait.\n\nIt IS normal, healthy, and good, to teach children that if something isn't urgent, they can wait until a parent is done with whatever they're doing. Within reason of course, on a sliding scale of how important the request is. Parents do NOT have to drop everything the second their child asks them for something. My mother certainly didn't, and it didn't traumatize me, it taught me that it's polite and reasonable to let someone finish what they're in the middle of if they wish to do so. If you don't teach them this, you're teaching them the opposite, that they should expect you to always drop everything immediately.\n\nThe wording you used regarding what your wife said suggests the task was something the child should be learning to do for themselves. Assuming that is true, then providing a delay can also help encourage the child to take on the task themselves. \n\nI think it's also pretty normal to teach exchanges in some situations with kids.

She could definitely work on her wording (in regards to the \u201cyou need to leave me alone\u201d part, there are much better ways to communicate the need to learn how to be a little independent without outright telling your child to leave you alone) but if you were right there it wouldn\u2019t have been undermining her to go \u201cI\u2019ll help you sweetie, mommy is in the middle of something but I\u2019m free right now.\u201d", "I think its probably a bit presumptive to suggest my child is developing slower than normal. I can assure you in all medical check ups she has been perfectly in line with normal development, she is bilingual considered to be above her age for fine motor skills, and counting and perfectly avergae in all other areas.", "She was late potty training but all other development things are on track. Don't get me wrong I full understand she needs to learn to be age appropriate independence and supporting that is important but its the clear case were she really does need help I'm concerned about", "I wouldn\u2019t say she is bilingual thanks to you, with that attitude! Look man, take it from someone who have been working with kids for years. You are not helping your kid with those answers you are giving me. \nDo what you want with that information, I still think your parenting can be majorly improved.", "Or maybe OP's sense that this is a problem is correct.", "When my 3 year old poops he will yell from the bathroom for me to wipe his butt. Lol. He does try to wipe himself but likes for me to make sure all is clean. But you are right they should be able to get to the bathroom in their own home", "Stupid.", "I'm open to criticism but you haven't explained why  you my parenting could be better, for that matter you haven't explained why it's bad\n\nAs for the bilingual thing why do you assume that couldn't come from me", "You should add this context to the OP as that definitely explains things better.  NTA but your wife has some issues.", "This is horrifying. Your wife is being abusive to a child who cannot help herself. For a THREE YEAR OLD to ask a parent for assistance with toilet training and then need to negotiate with the parent in order to receive it -- is monstrous. And what your wife wanted for her assistance was to not have to care for her little child for the rest of the night! \"Mommy will help you pee in the bathroom this time if you promise to not ask Mommy to help you again for the rest of the night.\"\n\nWe're talking about a *toddler* here.\n\nWhat would have happened if your daughter wet herself? We already know she would have inflicted anger, shame, and humiliation on her little girl. I expect it would be much worse than that.\n\nOP, you write that you didn't expect her to be transactional with her child as she was in all other aspects and relationships in her life. But you've seen now that she is, to the point of neglecting and abusing her own helpless daughter. I don't think this is a case of misguided parental behavior; your wife is a dangerously self-centered and selfish person who would allow her own 3YO to suffer if there were no personal advantage to gain by acting as a parent. \n\nThe description you have just offered here of your wife's behavior is a *textbook example* of abusive parental behavior. Refusal to help a small child with their bodily functions -- and demanding concessions for that help --  indicates that your wife, the mother of this little girl, has a deep level of disinterest in the needs of others. \n\nSo now you know. Your wife is neglectful and actually dangerous to your child's physical and psychological well-being. Your daughter can be emotionally damaged for the rest of her life by what your wife is doing to her right now, and no, this isn't an exaggeration. \n\nSo what are you, OP, going to do about it?", "Not if they've just learned. It's very reasonable for a recently potty trained child to still need help.", "I was trying to edit it but it doesn't seem to allow it", "I agree with that but the bathroom needs to be accessible for the child. That is how she is gonna learn to be able to go by herself if she is not already", "Op commented that the wife said \u201cIll help you go to the washroom but you have to leave me alone for the rest of the night.\u201d To a toddler."]}
