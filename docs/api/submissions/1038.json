If that is the case, then your wife is an A.  If not, then you are the A.  It does not hurt to let a child child know they will get help in a moment if there is no distress in the situation.  She is using her words to let the child know she will indeed help, but they need to wait a moment.  She is teaching the child to understand that not everything is urgent, that the child can wait for a moment before getting help without it being a problem.  She is teaching your child patience.  This is borderline, \"she will say I will only help if you do this this and this for me.\"  Once again, INFO: is she saying I will get the toys out for you as long as you pick them up?  Again, not the A.  That is an entirely reasonable thing to say to a toddler.  Parents do that all the time.  It is called training your kids to become decent human beings.  \"I will take you to the store with me if you do not grab things off the shelf.\"  \"We can go the toy store, but you can only get one thing and it needs to be under $10.\"  Unless she is saying I will get the toys for you if you get me a beer out of the fridge, then I'd have some issues.", "I definitely need more information. It's perfectly healthy for your toddler to learn they don't get everything immediately and they need to wait for things. Unless it's an emergency there's no need for your wife to jump up immediately. She can finish her text or drink. Also, as teachers we use a lot of first-then phrases. E.g. first you clean up your toys then you can do ________. If that's what she's doing, there's nothing wrong with it.", "There's not a lot to go on here but the examples you give don't sound that bad.  I think its reasonable to allow a parent a couple of minutes to finish what they're doing before jumping to the attention of anyone. As a mother I get no time to myself and I often have to tell my kids to wait whilst I finish my first drink of the day... at lunchtime, they need to learn that I also have basic needs and without these I can't help anyone!  Toddlers are also the perfect age to start learning independence and how to help with chores so its perfectly reasonable to cook them dinner but then ask them to help to wash up. Its an important lesson to teach.  The only time I'd say this wouldn't be appropriate is when your toddler is upset or hurt, then you drop everything to help.\nAnd if you're watching all this happen then why don't you help out the toddler instead?\n\nNTA but need more info or examples.", "NTA. Personally I don't see much wrong with \"yes mommy will help after I'm done with this task\" (like sending a text) but other than that it's weird and manipulative to tell a 3 year old they \"owe\" their parents something for helping them.", "NAH? Your story doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  \n\nWife is helping child but sometimes asks the child to wait until she is finished a task she was already doing.  That seems pretty normal... Children have to practice waiting and it's a bad habit to drop everything every time they ask (except of course if it's a safety issue or emergency).\n\nWife sometimes tells toddler I will help you do X if you can help me with Y.  Unless what she's asking the toddler to do is wildly age-inappropriate I don't see that it's a huge problem.  ie. \"Okay sweetie mommy will help you do up your buttons but I need to you put your socks on yourself\"  or \"Ok mommy will help you build your puzzle, but first I need you to put your stuffed toys away\"", "NTA\n\nOutside of the transactional nature of her view on interactions with others...\n\n>Our toddler can do it herself or wait\n\nNo... That's not what toddlers are. They can't do a lot of things by themselves, and while you don't want to create a situation where the toddler gets whatever they want, whenever they want, they do require more attention that someone whose mind and body is more fully formed.", "NTA, but you're married to one.", "It feels like there's a lot of info missing here, but I don't know exactly what to ask for.\n\n\nBased on this post, I'll say NTA, but a hollow NTA since I feel like we're missing something", "INFO: Which kind of help are we talking about?

She is sending your child on a positive path. \nChildren learn at a young age how to manipulate their parents. Maybe mom has a friend or family member whose child is suffering because a parent does every little thing for them and jumps the very second the child says to jump.\nEverything is about balance \nYou can't ignore a kid, but you also want the child to grow up to be an independent adult who realizes life isn't about I start gratification.", "NTA but does your wife hate her child?", "**NTA**\n\nThe word you're looking for is \"transactional\", and you're right, parents should absolutely never have a transactional relationship with their child, because parents have not only a moral and ethical but a LEGAL obligation to care for their child's needs. A child, on the other hand, does not owe their parents any such thing; particularly a toddler.\n\nWhat your wife is doing, telling your barely-out-of-babyhood child that she requires reciprocation for anything that she does for her, isn't just disgusting (though it is certainly that), it indicates a profoundly worrisome psychological perspective on the part of your wife. Expecting to have a transactional relationship removes any emotion from the relationship - it would be a cold and unsympathetic way to approach a friendship with a peer . . . as an approach to parenting a small child, it is absolutely disturbing. Does your wife have no maternal instinct? No emotional understanding of her child's vulnerability and developmental stage that requires her assistance as a guide and nurturer? \n\nHonestly, this isn't just a little problematic, it's kind of huge. I would be legit worried about parenting with someone who thinks that helping a toddler should be a transactional situation.

I wonder what makes your wife feel like life is a business transaction", "NTA. People are focusing on the \"I'll help you when I'm done\" and missing the \"I'll help you if you do XYZ for me\". If we're talking about a kid needing help with basic tasks/needs that they just haven't mastered yet, it's inappropriate to make that help conditional on the child doing something else unrelated to the task they need help with.", "NTA, your mindset here is exactly correct and your wife is going to do serious emotional damage to your child if she continues this way. A relationship with your children is not transactional, it is not trading favors; It is her *job* to care for and assist this child, end of. *Especially* with a toddler.  \n\n\nIt's okay for her to tell the child to wait until after she finishes doing something (if that something won't take long, and presuming the kid doesn't need help with anything serious), but instilling the idea in her that her mother won't help her unless she does something for her mother in return? That's setting your kid up for some major issues later in life, and will likely cultivate a really bad relationship between her and her mother.  \n\n\nIf she keeps on like this, your wife is going wake up one day wondering why your daughter doesn't trust, rely on, or want much of anything to do with her.", "NTA\n\nKeep this women away from any child!\n\nShe is really damaging her if the teach her, parents are people who only helps you, if you pay in any way for it.", "NTA and this is just weird behavior for a mother.", "NTA.

It's all they know how to respond with.\n\nThat said, yer maybe tell your wife to knock it off else the kids going to think every action needs to have a cost.

They shouldn't demand immediate attention from their parents for every little thing. It's okay to tell a child *Just a moment, mommy's on the phone.* \n\nAlso, it's not a bad thing to teach your child how to negotiate for the things that they want.

You seem to be talking about two different things: 1) requesting something in return, and 2) requesting for the child to wait.\n\nIt IS normal, healthy, and good, to teach children that if something isn't urgent, they can wait until a parent is done with whatever they're doing. Within reason of course, on a sliding scale of how important the request is. Parents do NOT have to drop everything the second their child asks them for something. My mother certainly didn't, and it didn't traumatize me, it taught me that it's polite and reasonable to let someone finish what they're in the middle of if they wish to do so. If you don't teach them this, you're teaching them the opposite, that they should expect you to always drop everything immediately.\n\nThe wording you used regarding what your wife said suggests the task was something the child should be learning to do for themselves.

There are many things in a given day I will let him try multiple times before I intervene. Children learn more from doing than having it done for them.\n\nEverything that that he does every day I teach him to try for himself before I help him. He is very independent. When dressing himself he only needs help with zippers and buttons. He knows his water cup is in the fridge and he lets me know when he is going to get it.

Granted, I've only seen a couple comments. \n\nIs your wife just telling your child to wait because she's busy and needs a moment? Or is she just putting the child off because she just doesn't want to do what's being asked of her? When she tells the child things like \"yes I'll help you get some juice BUT not until you put your toys back in the toy box.\" Because based solely on your post (I haven't read through all your comments) aside from the potty situation I don't see anything wrong with teaching your child that people don't jump at the snap of a finger and children struggle with doing things that aren't enjoyable so oftentimes, in order to get em to do those things, saying something like \"go find your shoes and put them by the door *and than* we'll go play outside\" or \"mommy is doing the dishes right now so if you want me to get your elephant stuffy you'll have to wait a few min.\" Or honestly, even if all she's doing is reading a book ffs, if what kiddo is asking for isn't a crisis type situation (potty accident, bleeding, a fire has started...you get the idea) it's perfectly ok for mom to not jump up and come running immediately at any and every demand. Toddlers want shit *constantly* they are a never-ending rotation of various wants wishes and desires and a large amount of those are neither \"drop everything and act *immediately*\" or even safe, logical or allowed (I wanna start a camping fire by myself! I'm a big girl, I can do it!\") \n\n\nHonestly, again, based *solely* on just what you've written in your post and the examples you provided, yeah dude, YTA. She isn't \"tit for tating\", she's trying to teach the kid that A) sometimes ya gotta wait a min and that's ok and B) that there are things we have to do that just aren't fun. But we still gotta do em and sometimes we gotta wait for the fun thing until we've done the not so fun thing. Both are *incredibly* important lessons. It sounds to be like if left to you in a few years you'll coddling her right into a child who expects to be at the front of every line all the time, for people to drop everything and do what she tells em to right than and there and that other peoples lives and free time isn't nearly as valuable as her and what she wants. \n\n\nI have 3 wonderful children 11f, 12m and a 19m and we all get along pretty well. I've done the teen years once already and am in the tween years again and while of course there are disagreements, there have never been any screaming raging fights, they've never called me names or told me they hate me, we talk constantly (lol sometimes I wish there was *a whole lot less* talking tbh \ud83d\ude04) they drag friends home or me to the computer to \"share\" me, all I'm saying here is that I didn't jump at every single request (obviously if it's something that literally *cannot* wait than yes, do it right than) I taught them they'd be ok of their desires weren't met immediately and they still seem to like me so....ya know, I dunno, maybe your wife deserves to be treated like a wife and mother and less like an indentured servant cuz the only problematic example you gave was the child needing to go potty, there were two parents sitting there and only one was expected to drop everything and handle it.

But sooner rather than later would be a good time to get on the same page with your wife in regards to parenting techniques. Aside from the developmentally inappropriate nature of her comments, your toddler is going to be really confused by the inconsistency in how you and your wife interact with her. It's one thing for parents to have different temperaments and subtly different expectations, but this contrast has been and will continue to be problematic. \n\nDevelopmental and emotional implications aside and merely from a pragmatic point of view, expecting a child to hold it when they explicitly said they have to pee NOW is really counterproductive to successful potty training. I'm not sure how long your daughter has been potty trained, but it's typically recommended that early on, the kid is escorted to the restroom frequently and asap so they learn to recognize their bodily cues that indicate when it's time to go. Ignoring her or telling her to wait could stunt that process if she's still new to potty training.  \n\nAs for your wife taking your kid to the restroom, with the condition that she leave her alone the rest of the evening. I mean...what? Really? Does that work? Because generally speaking, 3 year olds are not *super* independent (especially as it gets to evening/night and they need...ya know, dinner, bath, bedtime), nor are they known for keeping their word when it comes to agreements that they do not have the developmental capacity to agree to in the first place.\n\nI have to assume your wife didn't actually expect to be \"left alone\" by her toddler in exchange for assisting her with basic hygiene/bodily needs. Which leaves me to think she was either A. Passive aggressively implying to your toddler that her needs are an inconvenience and that wife's time is more value than that. Or B.

That\u2019s why we are recommending that the whole situation indicates individual therapy for you as well. \n\nI hope this comes off as warmly firm as intended. You seem like a good dad who has incredible intentions and I applaud you for that (my dad wouldn\u2019t have even thought to ask about the behavior he witnessed)", "A child of divorce is less damaged than a child who sees your wife's actions as acceptable and normal. Remember that your daughter is learning everything about being a person from you AND your wife. All the bad habits will be inherited and they'll be seen as okay because \"that's how my parents were\". \n\nI'm not saying you need to run from your wife by any means. The first step should always be therapy and counciling but divorce shouldn't ever be off the table out of fear of hurting the child. The damage of staying in a broken relationship only increases the chances of them experiencing the same situations as an adult and making the same mistakes.", "Document EVERYTHING. You may get primary custody if you can document every instance you see of her neglecting your child.\n\nAnd go see a lawyer ASAP. Good luck.", "Nah OP don't listen do this dude. OF COURSE you should be thinking more about your child cuz SHES A FREAKING TODDLER. You wife seems like she can take care of her \"basic needs\" just fine.\n\nIn my honest opinion, I think you would be much happier doing all this by yourself, rather than having someone around that makes you feel like shit while STILL doing everything by yourself.\n\nBut if you insist on trying to continue this transactional relationship, I def suggest the following:\n1) family/couples counseling (maybe even personal counseling for each of you)\n2) discussion of a fair division of household chores\n3) a plan on where she sees herself in the next 5 years (i.e. a plan on how she is going to \"find herself\" because I think she's found all that  Sensei Couch has to offer)", "Right? Like I am of an age where my friends are having babies/toddlers and i have taken the little ones potty cause my friend needed to do something else in the moment and toddlers have tiny bladders so it's a race against the clock before theres pee everywhere. Even after reading some of OPs other posts wife may have clinical depression but the way she treats the daughter doesnt sit right with me. Toddlers are just tiny humans who dont know how to human yet and that's why we help them. Also if you created one demi humans dont owe you you owe the demi human.", "Could be failure to bond with the child as the hormones usually produced aren't there? My first reaction as someone who works in this field is that she hasn't received proper care as a child and is therefore unable to bring up her child - child rearing is largely learnt from our own childhood experiences, especially attachment and how to co-regulate which she doesn't seem to understand. Really sad but yeah I would echo others that counselling with a focus on attachment issues is needed", "Please seriously consider leaving your wife and raising your toddler alone. This post, plus your post history is very concerning. Please don't make your poor child grow up with your wife as a role model. That kiddo will grow up feeling like a burden, like they're not wanted, like they're just an inconvenience. No child should feel like that. Add in all the other issues, like your wife refusing to work after making your agreement, she expects you to do far more than your share of housework while you alone are working. She seems to see your child as something to avoid as much as possible, like bargaining with your toddler, saying that if she helps your kid go to the toilet, then your kid has to leave her alone the rest of the night. \n\n\nHow would you feel, if you were told that your basic human need to urinate, is SO inconvenient, and that the person helping you finds you so irritating to be around, that it's a reward for them to get to avoid being around you for the rest of the day. How heartbreaking would that be to hear, from your own mother. Even though your child is a toddler, they absolutely will absorb that kind of thing. Their personality and brain is shaped so much by these early years, don't let your child's sense of self be ruined this early by your wife's treatment", "Divorce, you do not want her around your child. She is not reliable.", "This is how emotional neglect happens.", "This broke my heart.  My daughter is the same age and freshly trained.  If she tells me she has to go, we sprint to the bathroom.  The last thing I want for her is to have an embarrassing accident.  OP, your wife is cruel.  NTA at all and please reconsider your relationship with this woman.", "Where was he when his child was asking?", "Their kid is about to inherit some Complex PTSD. I would imagine that his wife's Mom treated/raised her the same way and now she's passing it down to her daughter which is why his wife doesn't see the problem. The wife definitely needs therapy ASP before she messes this child up!", "Yep, that tracks. Man, another adoptee abused by their purchasers. Wish it wasn't so common ):", "Honestly, she sounds like one of those people who regret becoming a parent and instead of going to therapy or at least talking to their partner about it, they take it out on the child. \n\nReminds me of that other AITA of the dad whose wife \u201cdisliked\u201d (that was how she put it IIRC) their son even though she had actively decided on having the child and discussed it with him beforehand. She eventually started resenting their son and refused to show him any affection or parent him in any way. The dad ended up filing for divorce and full custody. \n\nI have a feeling this is exactly where this guy is headed as well.", "OMG! He needs to grab his daughter and run!!!!", "It doesn't seem like depression though. She goes out with friends, goes to the gym, does many things for herself etc. Not saying those things can't happen when depressed. Just based on this post and prior posts, she seems really controlling and potentially narcissistic. I hope OP stands up for themselves and their kiddo. Counseling is like the minimum here. I think OP should at least get into therapy themselves. I am always afraid when there are signs of abuse. The abuser can use counseling to better hide the abuse. Ugh.", "Based on both posts, I get the feeling wife would leverage custody for the child support payments.  Seems like she\u2019s intending to leech off of him for at least the next 18 years and never find a job.", "She sounds like the type who would just out of spite.", "Honestly, I just don't understand how you could treat a child that badly, especially if you went out of your way to adopt people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm very glad you had a better experience than the child is experiencing in this OP, it breaks my heart to know adopted kids are othered sometimes. It's just not right.", "I think based on your current and past posts, to get through to her is to put a white board or large paper in the middle of the room and list all of your responsibilities side by side based on the past week of work so she can't say, \"but I did more than that this week\" or \"I had plans that day\" or whatever she wants to use as an excuse. That way you can say, this is where the inequality is and this is what I would want us to work on for us and our kid. Maybe make the list together at the same time but don't show each other until the end if you feel like she'll be honest or make it beforehand for both sides before you show it in case you feel like she would say \"I do more than you because I put it on the list.\" Especially since she's a stay at home mom who has her kid at full time daycare. That's a bit overly ridiculous on top of her lacking understanding on why conditioning help to the bathroom for a 3 year old is abusive.", "Another book is Not The Price of Admission, a book for adults raised by parents like your wife. If you need perspective, that book will let you know just what your daughter will face and what your role in her trauma is unless you protect her.", "A child should feel comfortable that their parents are there for them unconditionally, no matter what. NTA", "Yeah I have to say this is not depressed behavior.  Depressed people may have low energy but they aren\u2019t insensitive to a toddler\u2019s feelings.  This is Axis 2 pathology (a personality disorder) I bet.", "Why, exactly, do you respect your wife after the way she acts?", "I treat my dog better than this.", "NTA Your wife sounds like a 12 year old negotiating with someone. And is she insane because that's not how potty training works! Would she rather have spent the evening cleaning the floor because she didn't take the kid to the bathroom?", "NTA but I'm genuinely confused on how you didn't see this coming knowing your wife and either discuss or go to therapy before having a child. Seriously like an ounce of foresight would've saved you and your kid from misery", "NTA\n\nYour wife is setting up your child to feel that love is earned and her needs are an inconvenience. This is like, ultim\u00e1tum territory for me. If my wife treated my child like this, I would be saying we go to a counselor to fix this or we\u2019re done.", "I've made my toddler wait, but it\u2019s for non essential things like \"yes i will go get you a cookie when I'm finished with what I'm doing\" not \"I wod rather you wet yourself than interrupt my coffee\"i have no clue what op's wife wanted to be a parent.", "This right here, it's straight up abuse that she's doing it with urgent tasks, but it would still be fundamentally morally wrong that she is telling a toddler that they need to earn help, thus trying to mentally harm that toddler.", "Sounds like post-partum depression...", "You would be amazed at what people 'want' when a check is involved.", "Your perspective is right, your wife sounds neglectful an abusive towards your daughter. What is she contributing to the relationship? It sounds like you\u2019re essentially a single parent already\u2026 File for full custody, and take good care of that little girl.", "I was to clarify that she\u2019s abusive to both the daughter and OP. Physical neglect for daughter, verbal abuse for OP. Get out please.", ">\tPlease, please, do not let her tear you down until you\u2019re too low to hold up your daughter.\n\nBeautifully put. My father started out being able to stand up for me and seeing right from wrong. Now he is just a husk of his former self and tells me he will take my moms side no matter what. Its fucking brutal. No one can withstand decades and decades of abuse and gaslighting without being changed.", "I second this! I\u2019m a depressed person (I go to therapy and actively work on my issues) with a 4 yr old! Taking my toddler to the potty is a joy because I\u2019m so proud of him. OP\u2019s wife is just an AH! I grew up with a father who is transactional. I\u2019m 35 and he\u2019s still transactional. Take it from some someone who knows OP, not having unconditional love but transactional love from a parent is a hard pill to swallow for a child. Children are not dumb. This IS abusive behavior and children understand comparison very well. Your daughter will catch sooner than you think. Please protect her like my mother didn\u2019t protect me.", "Out of curiosity, where were you? You know all the details of the convo, could you have also helped take your child to the bathroom? Your wife was wrong, but I don\u2019t understand why you watched this happen and didn\u2019t step in. Did I miss something?"]}
