When I was an adolescent she moved halfway across the globe to give me a better chance at life so I have always felt indebted to her. However, she is incredibly controlling and at times even selfish. \nShe has never allowed me to have a boyfriend (shamed my only boyfriend for not being wealthy and asked me to break up with him for it, even though we aren\u2019t either). She is judgmental about the way I look, and when I got a job across the country that paid really well and was able to move out, she threw a massive fit and said I am soulless and unloving for wanting to move out. This is after we bought a house in our original city together that I agreed to continue paying the hoa fees for even after moving out. I gave in and had her move in with me. Now I am stuck in a situation where I pay for the housing and bills and everything and she lives with me and doesn\u2019t work. She however cooks and takes care of the house which I\u2019m very grateful for. I would be totally fine with all this if she was willing to compromise with me even the slightest bit. \nI recently had a birthday, and she wanted me to plan something for it. So I set up a dinner out which we had with a few of our friends. It was a beautiful night; I had the best time. During planning this, we found out that one of our friends would be unable to make it to the dinner, so I was going to do something with her separately, and I had begged my mom to not invite people over to our house. I work long hours and we have a puppy. When we have people over, my mother hates that the puppy gets excited so she puts him on a leash and has me hold him the whole time. This makes it difficult for me and him both. \nI came home tonight at 8 pm to the news that we were going to have a birthday dinner in our house within 30 minutes. There were only 2 guests, but I was already exhausted and now roped into something that I explicitly asked to not happen. \nLow and behold, I was miserable the whole time. I was constantly on hold-the-dog duty while being tired and dealing with cramps. I just wanted these people to leave and there they were talking about manicures and Spain. By the time that they left (after 11 pm) I had been secretly glaring daggers at them and my mom for hours. I tried to act nice, didn\u2019t say a rude thing, but was also not very into the conversation, and when they said they should leave, I didn\u2019t contradict them. My mother thinks I am the asshole for not being happy that she cooked and planned a second birthday dinner for me.

Whatever she chose to do to give you a better life in her eyes is on her. It was her responsibility to take of you and you don't owe her a damn thing for that. For her to rob you of experiencing life without her is sad. It sounds to me like your misery makes her happy and that's even sadder. I hope one day you can break free and live the life you want.", "NTA the reason she controlled you so much and made you feel so indebted as a child is so that she could control your life as an adult. She has made it very hard for you to break away and lead your own life. She is forcing you to do things that you do not want to do. The whole evening you spent doing exactly what she wanted, something no other 24 year old would of stood for. You need to break out of the cage you yourself have created as an adult that you mum manipulated you into creating as a child. You psy the bills, you have the power over her, not the other way around. You need to start making the rules. Take over. The power is in your hands as the one with the money. Tske charge, take control. Start telling her it is your way or get out.", "NTA. You need to untangle from your mother. Live in a different place with a locked door and privacy when you get home from work - where the only guests will be people you invite or know about well in advance. \n\nYour mother will not change on her own because she's happy with things the way they are. I know that she complains a lot and acts unhappy and makes you feel guilty for it. But I'm willing to bet that she only acts that way when you threaten the status quo by being disobedient, seeking any independence, or asking for basic respect. The situation is working exactly the way she wants it to -- she keeps you close, makes major decisions about your housing and dating, and knows exactly how to make you give in to her demands.\n\nGet a therapist with experience in learning to set boundaries, enmeshment, and financial decision-making. I'm very serious about this; nothing about your situation will change unless you acknowledge you are not happy like this and take steps toward change on your own, for the sake of any future happiness.", "ESH (except the guests)\nYou need to start communicating and maintaining some boundaries. You still silence yourself and defer to your mom when she violates what should be a boundary of yours. Your time and attention are limited. Your self care needs are real and need support in your daily routines.\n\nYou have to stop violating your comfort zone when your mom ignores the needs and boundaries you communicate.\n\nRather than silently seethe, remove yourself from situations where your boundaries aren't respected.\n\"Oh! (guests)! I'm so sorry, but I am exhausted. I need to rest and didn't expect to walk into a dinner party. It's nice to see you. I'm going to take a shower and a nap. I've been pushing all afternoon to finally get home and rest. I'm so sorry I don't have the energy for entertaining right now. I'm sure you understand. What I NEED right now is rest.\"\n\nStart speaking up for yourself and walking away from conversations and situations where you're not respected. Constantly facing arguments that undermine your needs and priorities is exhausting. The argument in itself is punishment for your being different than the person undermining you insists you ought to be. People who respect boundaries accept \"no\" and don't continue to pressure one to change that. People who don't respect boundaries are people with whom you need stronger and consistently maintained boundaries.", "YTA and need to grow a backbone. Your mom shouldn't live with you.

(I know it is easier said than done, but once you start asserting yourself and sticking with the boundaries you set, it will become easier over time.
