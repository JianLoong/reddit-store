I work in higher education and see cases like your son\u2019s all the time where the student started out rough and then turned their life/academics around.

A 1.0 GPA to a 3.7 is a very dramatic change, so I'm wondering if there was something else going on in his life that made him get grades that were so low in his first couple years in college.\n\nIt's not on you to fund his way through a PhD. Let's be realistic. Yes, a lot of programs are self-funded, but they're usually **extremely** competitive and difficult to get into, and someone has to be supporting you on the side for housing and food (or you have to work yourself to the bone since self-funded programs basically employ you as research assistants).\n\nIt's on you to be realistic with him. But you also went overboard by calling him delusional. You don't have to unconditionally support him financially because that's too much of a burden on you to expect. But if he can figure it out, he can figure it out, and calling him delusional was discouraging, not reality-checking.", "Parenting is hard, but your son is an adult.

I had a 3.2 GPA and I bombed the physics GRE hard (I still remember the look of mixed shock and shame  when I told my undergrad research advisor my score), yet here I sit with a PhD in astrophysics and a successful research career until I decided to leave for industry work.  If it's something he really wants, it is certainly achievable by getting involved in research as an undergrad and getting some (even just 1 gives you a pretty big leg up) publications under his belt.  Professors are willing to overlook a lot if you have demonstrable experience conducting quality research.\n\nDoes that mean he would succeed if he pursued it?  Not necessarily, and it will definitely be difficult (as you'd expect when it comes to getting a PhD in anything), but it's not as delusional as you think.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - people have a rough go of it sometimes.\n\nMy husband flunked out of undergrad due to some bad choices and not focusing. He did the community college thing a year later, got great grades and went back for his bachelors at a 4-year. He is now an MD. Just took him 7 years after high school to get a bachelors, but places look favorably upon students who turned their lives around.", "YTA.\n\nYou state in the comments that your son started doing well in school after changing his ADHD medication. That makes a huge difference and explains how someone goes from flunking to a 3.7 gpa.\n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t have strong understanding of your son\u2019s struggles and how important it is to have proper treatment.\n\nUnless you are financing his choices this doesn\u2019t concern you.", "YTA. 3.7 is a great gpa, especially if its in science courses which I'm assuming it is since he wants to do a phd in physics. If he's taking those classes those are really hard and that will be taken into consideration when he applies for graduate school. Also, they will notice that his GPA went way up after his first year of college. His later behavior in classes is much more important than before\n\nAs long as he keeps this GPA up, he should be just fine. And physics is such an awesome field you should be supportive!\n\nAlso, just some tips for him: look into REU programs through the NSF (a great way to get research experience that can give him some insight into a PhD program life and will be a great help to him when getting into graduate school. Also tell him to try to get some jobs he can get as an undergrad as well. He can look into teaching assistantships potentially or tutoring other ways where he can work in the department and get to know his professors and advisor better so they can write better recommendation letters for him for graduate school.\n\nediting to add: Also tell him to take some computer science courses. Being able to code will serve him really well when he's in his physics PhD program\n\nAlso don't scoff at a gpa of 3.7. That's really good, especially for a physics major.", "YTA. You can't just derail his life because YOU would do things differently. Maybe try being supportive, because knocking him down is only setting him up for failure.", "YTA\n\nCollege can be a tough transition. For whatever reason, your son had a hard time with the first attempt. The good news is that he didn't let that stop him and he's figured some things out. Looks like your son is living the Nelson Mandela quote, \"*I never lose. I win or I learn.\"*\n\nWho knows how far he can go? Maybe he will fail spectacularly and go into something else. Maybe he'll succeed. Maybe he'll discover another passion and pursue that. Why not tell him that you love his ambition and wish the best for him? Why so pessimistic? You might want to think about that.", "YTA.\n\nParents are supposed to encourage their kids, not smash their dreams. Sure you can be realistic and help him remember that \"today\" and \"today's needs\" are important and need to be covered, but that doesn't mean that the dreams can't be achieved.", "YTA. \n\nNot only an asshole, but a bad parent. If your kid is struggling you should ask him why and how to help. If your kid is so passionate about his career aspirations that his grades improved from a 1.0 to a 3.7 you should be CELEBRATING the success. Your son failed and turned it around and is now succeeding. That should be celebrated and encouraged. \n\nHe pays for his own school so im not sure why youre offering your unsolicited advice anyway. You clearly dont have a PhD or are not familiar with the requirements to get in. \n\nGrades are not the full story. Passion, drive, continuing after failure make a great PhD. In zero PhDs is someone 100% successful. Experiments fail, you make mistakes, you learn and eventually (maybe) you graduate. \n\nOP, parenting like that is the reason so many PhDs have such a hard time dealing with failure. For most of us, it isnt until graduate school where we really start to fail and then we dont know how to work through it and we feel like we cant come back from it. Failing at something does not mean you should just give up. Persistence is what makes a successful scientist and researcher. His persistance and fortitude will shine on an application. Your inability to grasp that success isnt always a straight line and one failure means you should give up is disgusting.\n\nEdit: your response to the bot \"I know a better path for him\" also makes you the asshole and a bad parent. Forcing your kid to do what you want them to do just makes depressed and resentful kids. From: the depressed and resentful kid because my parents wanted me to be an M.D instead of the dreaded PhD.", "NAH\n\nHe's an adult he needs to make his own decisions about his education and career, and actually 3.7 gpa is not bad (although he flunked out of college the first time).  That being said he does need to understand the real world, and in particular, how difficult it is to get into a PHD program, let alone complete one.\n\nThat being said, he is doing well enough in community college that he probably will be able to transfer to a four year college, and if he does, he may be able to get into a post-grad program of some type if he does really well, but he needs to understand that if he wants to apply for a PHD program, he is going to need a 4.0+ from here on out.  Anything less and he will not get in, that's just the reality of how competitive most of those programs are.  You shouldn't trample on his dreams, but he needs to know that his goals are extremely lofty, he needs to be 110% to have a chance.\n\nI think a problem that parents and family members have when kids are going off to college is that, because they want them to do well, they sort of flood them with positive encouragement, which is great, but they also need to understand reality, and that if they are going to try to become a PHD, a MD, or something along those lines, it is going to be a hard, brutal process and to get admitted to those kind of programs, it takes huge amount of effort and near perfection, so if they aren't totally all-in, it's not going to happen.", "While I totally agree with you about your son's prospects but YTA for telling him that when he pays his own way.

As someone who\u2019s parents always knocked me down I suggest you stop before he decides in the future to go low contact with you for his own mental sake.

I failed so badly I did not get into any university, so I took 4 years out and worked in kitchens. I then reapplied to a foundation degree (pre-uni access course) and did well enough to transfer to a better university for my undergraduate. I did so well in my undergraduate, I am now reading for a masters degree at the University of Oxford. \n\nI doubt if I had passed my alevels the first time that I would have had the drive and motivation to succeed in the way I am now.

Failure now does not mean failure in the future.", "Just wanted to chime in here as a physics Ph.D. who now sits on the side where I get to review the transcripts.\n\nFirst, you are absolutely right.  We will see the transcripts and the grades from when your son had a 1.0.  If his application letter is coming in hard about wanting to be a theorist, then he\u2019s going to have a problem.  On the other hand, most of the best experimentalists I have known had had some issues in undergrad, myself included.  Taking tests and classes are very different than doing the job.  Going back and retaking the courses shows me a drive and tenacity that lets me know he will stick through the gruelling thesis process.  That\u2019s far more important to me than his freshman grades.\n\nAs for concern about being required to support him, physics PhD positions are almost universally fully-funded, regardless of institution. To put it differently, the number of grad students we accept is usually set by the number we can afford to fund.  This isn\u2019t just tuition remission - it includes a stipend.  Every physics grad student I have known had lived on this stipend.  It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s not destitution, either.\n\nIt might be worth having a talk with your son about where he sees this going.  If he wants to be the next Dirac or Feynman, that ship has probably sailed.  The are not many funded theory positions and those do tend to go to obvious prodigies.  However, if he wants to get his hands dirty and actually do physics, we do have a place for him.", "YTA\n\nWow what an unsupportive parent you are.

He really just needs some research experience and good recommendations, as long as he does well on the GREs, his current GPA is pretty good for a graduate program like that.", "He has a part-time job.  He pays for school, gas, eating out, and his insurance. That's it.", "No he started over at community", "The son is paying for it", "The first year isn't going to carry much weight if the GPA picks up.", "They will and they wont. \n\nYes the whole record is there. No they dont care as long as their is improvement and its sustained. If he manages to excel in community college and then go back and continue exceling, he absolutely will get in especially if its addressed in the application essays. \n\nHe'll need to committ. Get involved in research. Shadow someone, maybe join a summer program to help beef the resume and show how serious he is but if this is what he wants he shouldnt be encouraged to give up.", "They will give much more weight to more recent grades.", "Probably not actually because he retook the classes and did much better which is even a stronger case of him bouncing back. Also people go to med school at like 40 even", "I have a Ph.D in Biology and had an incredibly rough start like your son's.  I lost my grandmother who raised me my freshman year and I spiralled.  I pulled my shit together a year and a half later, went to community college, did well and transferred to a new university.  \n\nYou also don't need a 4.0 to get into grad school. Especially in the sciences, doing well in undergrad doesn't exactly translate to doing well in grad school. I saw lots of 4.0 students drop out of grad school because they couldn't actually apply any of that \"knowledge\".  I was ok as an undergrad and did great in grad school. It's much more applying concepts and actually doing things rather than rote memorization.  \n\nThe application letter also makes a world of difference and it's easy for committees to overlook a rough start. Working in a lab and doing undergrad research is also way more important than a 4.0. \n\nIf he can get into a lab working for a prof and does well, that profs recommendation letter to grad school is super important to committees.  Also, approaching profs ahead of applying and getting them to \"sponsor you\" goes a really long way. \n\nRegardless, my point is that he is by no means out of reach of grad school because he had a rough start. It seems like you don't want him to be a physicist and don't believe in him.", "Sure, but he will have to retake any courses he failed that are required for a physics degree, and those are the final grades that will carry the most weight. And he can retake ones he got a D in as well.  Some people just are not ready for college right out of high school.  It is a fairly common problem.\n\nI did get my degree in physics despite numerous people telling me I should do something else, not because of my grades, but because I was a girl.  The one person who told me I could do it was my dad.  If your son has a passion for physics and you straighten up and support him and cheer him on, it will make all the difference.\n\nAnd even if he doesn't go for a PhD in the end, a BS in  physics degree will get him a ton of well paying job opportunities in lots of careers, not just physics,  from engineering to medical to financial to computers.", "So what?  They will see that your son took a little longer to find himself.  And they will see that he is now committed to his education and getting good grades.

You want to make him feel like he is being supported by his dream.", "You should be proud of him for figuring things out and having a clear path for his future.", "People tend to do way better in grad school if they start later. Burn out is real, and common for those who come straight out of undergrad without any life experience.", "So your saying he has improved massively and now takes his grades much more seriously and is more driven?\n\nSo because of his improvement you now think he has less of chance now then when he had a 1.0 gpa?", "But going from a 1.0 to a 3.7 is a MAJOR change. Did he start therapy? Was his living situation bad? Was he going to an ivy league?", "Why are you even talking to your son about this if he pays for school. Go away and leave him alone.", "If he pays for school, why are you telling him what to do?", "Is it just that you want him out of the house? If so, just tell him he\u2019ll have to look into student housing programs if he\u2019s going to graduate school.", "Does he help with utilities and groceries at home? \nDoes he help with chores at home? Do you need this help? Did you ask him for it?", "Well then the problem will sort itself out when he transfers again. NAH but you should just give up for your own sanity and wait for the glorious \u201cI told you so\u201d.", "You told him your thoughts. Let it be. It\u2019s his money.", "They look at the last two years of school. He will be fine. Learn to support your kid.", "She also clarified in a response to my comment that the main change was that he changed his ADHD medication. That's explainable to grad schools.", "Yeah, but he's looking to her to support him financially through most of it, and before you say \"a lot of phd programs are self-funding,\" self-funding =/= a paying job. At the very least she'll be funding him into his 30s. That's too much to expect of a mom. She's TA for calling him delusional since that's not helpful to anyone, but he's not entitled to her help", "He can't lie about his gpa.", "What? When did I say any of that?", "He changed his ADHD  medication. That's really the only major change. But he's been on meds for years now.", "OP didn't answer the first question. If he lives with them and doesn't pay rent, then that changes things.", "It's his money, but he's living in her house. She gets to kick him out or stop funding him, but she doesn't get to call him delusional.", "Depends on the school, but he can target his applications to those that only consider the last 60 credits in admission GPA, or weight it heavier. He can even attempt to apply to a program that weighs all years equally and explain that he struggled in the beginning, but then he figured it out.", "They even give you an opportunity to write an essay explaining things like this.", "The son is paying for his own school right now. He isn\u2019t entitled to help but his parent also shouldn\u2019t say he is not good enough to get into to grad school.", "It\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re coming back at every question or reply so aggressively. If you didn\u2019t want to be judged, why did you post here?", "Are you saying that his 1.0 gpa from 2015 is what he is truly capable of and the 3.5 gpa is a fluke because the classes were less credits and retakes? \n\nWhat kind of realism are we talking here. Why should he listen to you instead of his doctors and academic advisors? \n\nYTA because you sound negative and discouraging to your child when they are trying their hardest to plan and strive to be successful. If he wasn\u2019t studious or working to achieve his goals you might not be as much of an Ah. What kind of parent deliberately demoralizes their child?", "And he's not. He's got a 3.7, is that not amazing?", "See, that would be relevant to the post.", "add this to the post", "Yeah major change to leave out. you're the asshole. I'm on ADHD meds being on the wrong ones can wreck you. Seems he's a smart kid just had medical problems he now solved.", "Absolutely agree. She gets to say that she's not going to be involved but she doesn't get to insult him", "One who doesn't want to contribute financially for 4+ years", "Yup.", "In that case the positive thing to say is that let\u2019s discuss your goals and how you plan to achievable them and she can then set a boundary on what she is willing/unwilling to do to facilitate that. She said give up because your goal is unrealistic like he wanted to fly to the moon like he\u2019s Superman.", "YTA, OP.\n\nI have been in higher education for 14 years, primarily in Academic Advising and Academic Student Services. Here is a non- comprehensive list of reasons I have seen students like your son not do well in a big 4 year initially:\n- issues with homesickness\n- issues with undiagnosed or unreported disabilities, including mental health issues like depression and anxiety or neordivergence like unmedicated ADHD (we can provide accommodations to help, but we have to KNOW)\n- roommate issues\n- failure fitting in or finding a friends group\n- first time away from parents who have otherwise controlled their schedule until now, so no time management or study skills\n- a little too much freedom and a little bit too little maturity. \n\nIf, on retake of classes, your son has a 3.7, he is absolutely performing at a level where graduate school could be possible. My recommendation to him is to look at smaller 4 years where he can continue to benefit from the smaller class sizes and more personal attention he is likely getting in his community college classes. \n\nInstead of shooting down his dreams, ask him what he thinks has made the difference in how he's doing now and how he can carry that forward into his academic career when he transfers.\n\nHe should also talk to his original school and see if they have an academic bankruptcy program. Some schools offer this where if you have been out for a while, have gone back at the community college level or at another school and done well, they will do a \"bankruptcy\" of his Academic record. It will still show he took classes, but all of them will have a designation equivalent to a withdrawal which will improve his overall GPA between all schools. Not all institutions do this, but it's worth asking. \n\nBut I have seen students come from much worse odds and succeed. Please don't count your son out.", "NTA, especially if you're the one funding any of this. Seven years of school and only 1 passing year at community college? Those saying Y T A must be on similar educational trajectories and need to get back to their textbooks.", "YTA. Let him get his BS first. Make sure he connects with his professors while in school and so they can get to know him. As he finishes his degree his professors can guide him if they think he\u2019s grad school material.", "YTA. I\u2019m uniquely qualified to answer this one as I am in the same boat as your son, just a few years down the road. I am finishing a successful first semester as a physics PhD student after graduating with a scholarship designed to help students apply to graduate school. \n\nIt\u2019s not an easy road but that GPA proves your son has corrected his academic problems. A 3.7 is a great transfer GPA and a paid NSF research experience after he transfers will make him a good candidate if he still wants to apply to graduate school. The schools cares almost more about research and recommendation letters as they do about grades. \n\nFurthermore he appears to have set very realistic and achievable goals.  There are scholarships, programs, and opportunities available to students like him. I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s acting coldly. We are used to strangers telling us to give up and we\u2019re not good enough, but it always hurts more to hear it from family.", "YTA-  as a parent why in the hell would you crush his dreams like that telling him he delusional.

It's possible", "YTA", "They also will allow him to explain poor grades in his application. That's what I did. Working on my masters now after having a 1.2 GPA at one point.", "It\u2019s not the end all be all. Frankly, if you want him to get a college degree, encourage him or he might just drop out rather than continue his education. See how he does after more classes. If he manages to get a physics BS, he\u2019s already much more employable than he is currently. If he doesn\u2019t get accepted to physics phd programs, then he can figure out his next steps whether getting a job etc.", "Academia will already be judging your son and the last thing he needs is a parent that does the same.

He is getting on with his life. It sounds like he will be much more successful than you.", "That honestly is probably true lol I'm in psych and assumed that it was mostly the same across the board. My bad", "Grad school will ask for ALL the transcripts, there's no starting over. A 3.7 GPA isn't as amazing as what some of the commenters make it out to be, especially since it's lower division classes that he retook a second time. What's more important though, is how he will handle the upper division courses. \n\nI know people with undying support from their parents who still think they'll get into medical school with a 2.0 GPA. It's a bit early to say for certain whether or not he'll make it to a physics PhD. I'd reserve your judgment until you see how he is with the upper division courses.", "> I told him he was delusional and he needs to be more realistic. \n\nWow - you've got an awesome pep talk there, OP.\n\nHow about recommending he review his goals with a college advisor (NOT YOU) to see which paths work best for HIM.\n\nYTA.", "...You think your kid can't handle this decision, so you want them to change to a totally unrelated field where their capabilities (of which you have a low opinion) can alter someone's medical treatment and costs?\n\nK.\n\nYTA.", "If you are already saying he is delusional for wanting to do physics, why suggest radiography or any other major? That just sounds delusional to me.\n\nIf you are going to rubbish his dreams you might have had a better reaction had you said \"quit college altogether and just do Onlyfans instead \".", "YTA for not being supportive of your son. Everyone goes at their own pace and it sounds like your son is finally putting in the work and getting good results. Also YTA twice because what's wrong with Radiography? Do you somehow think radiography is super easy?", "YTA.\n\nSounds like he's growing up now and you only want to remind him of being the slacker kid that he used to be.", "YTA. I wonder if OP is Asian because Asian parents are good at shitting on their kid's dreams.", "Yta!

I would know, I did both college and university engineering and university engineering was many times more difficult.\n\nWith that said, your son flunking the first year of engineering honestly isn't that unreasonable. It's extremely difficult, many smart people drop out quickly. Your son has made a good effort to improve, I think it's worth it for him to give it another shot, but he should finish at least some sort of education and if he fails again, then it's not smarts he is lacking but instead discipline.

It took him 5 years (to fail) for about 3 semesters of coursework before, and now he's taken 2 years to do 1 year of work.

They don't offer higher level math or science classes at community college.", "Credits at a community college may not be weighted as highly as credits from a bigger college. I\u2019ve had friends with a 3.9 in community college tank to 2.7 after they transferred to a bigger college. It\u2019s also harder to get jobs with a physics degree compared to something more practical.\n\n PhD positions are also very very competitive. Unless he\u2019s already taking steps like doing summer research fellowships and presenting at symposiums, his chances are not going to be good. Kids these days all want to \u201cpursue their dreams\u201d and not enough are advised to be realistic. Dreams rarely pay bills, and it\u2019s rare that job fulfillment and a good salary go hand in hand", "Why do you think he is delusional?

Now if he\u2019s been working a full time role 40+ hours a week and pursuing education on the side while maintaining good grades in preparation to return back to a 4 year program, then no he is not delusional I would say he got his priorities straight and is ready to take that step. All depends on context here in my opinion\n\nEdit: to add as well, when I was at Uni I had friends who took Econ and other courses through community college, and they were substantially easier than the large institution we were at, but counted as transferable credits.
