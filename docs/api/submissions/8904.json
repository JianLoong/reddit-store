We decided to have a Childfree wedding celebration. This means no kids at the rehearsal and wedding. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother and wife live about 6 hours away. They have two kids. My Wife\u2019s parents live in the same town as the wedding. They are coming in the Wednesday before the wedding since there will be stuff Thursday, Friday, and Saturday(day of the wedding). In stead of staying at the hotel to partake in all the wedding festivities they are going to stay at her parents, since her parents volunteered to help with kids during the wedding. However there are some events that my future SIL will miss. Like the girls party Thursday night since my future BIL will be the bachelor night. She will also miss the bridal luncheon Friday morning to watch her kids. My wedding is Childfree. I got upset and said if they can\u2019t find a babysitter where they live to watch kids they shouldn\u2019t even come. My wedding celebration is Childfree and certain events are being impacted by kids. My future BIL and SIL are mad and said they doing the best they can. They are still going to bring there kids to town when they are in town for the wedding.", "created_utc": 1675301301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rcpso/aita_for_getting_upset_that_my_future_sil_and_bil/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You'll be there.", "YTA. It\u2019s sounds like your BIL and SIL are trying their best to be flexible so that BIL can attend most of the events, which makes sense since his brother is the one getting married. \n\nYou decided on a childfree event, that was your choice, but that is all that you get to decide. What parents do for childcare, which events they are able to attend and how long they are able to attend them for, is up to the parents.", "So the kids are banished from the entire town because your wedding is child free? Lmao I wanted to be with you when I read the title, but YTA.", "YTA. They are trying their best and you should be grateful. Many people with 2 kids would just not attend your wedding due to it being child free and far away.", "YTA.  You expect them to leave their kids for 4-5 days and travel 6 hours away...to attend your parties?\n\nThey will be there for the very important events. They have made arrangements for their children to honor your \"no-child\" requirement.\n\nYou're mad at them because they're going to miss a bridal lunch and a girl's party?  Definitely, YTA. Grow up.", "YTA.  They aren\u2019t bringing the kids to your child free wedding.  Why do you feel entitled to people\u2019s time over 3-4 days?  You get the wedding if you are lucky.  The rest you get if they can manage.  If I were them, I\u2019d go visit the parents and skip all of your wedding and not send any sort of congratulations.  No one cares about your wedding as much as you do and your entitled attitude would make them care even less.", "YTA, and a bridezilla. It's entirely your right to have a childfree wedding, but you shouldn't be surprised, or upset, that some parents won't be able to fully participate. Get over yourself.", "YTA. Your wedding is child free but it doesn't mean people have to spend 3 full days away from their kids just to humour you.", "YTA. It's fine to say no kids at the wedding but you can't dictate what people do outside of it. And you can't get mad because they decide not to participate because of your rules.", "YTA.

Children aren't dogs you can book into a kennel for a week while you go away to party. They're an infant and a toddler for goodness sake. They're accommodating your childfree wedding as best they can while balancing their responsibilities as parents.\n\nYou are perfectly entitled to have a childfree wedding, but you can't complain when parents will have to balance their responsibilities with your festivities.", "YTA just because your wedding is childfree doesn't mean their family is childfree.", "YTA\n\nTake a seat and brace yourself, because I have something to say that will shock you: the world doesn't revolve around you. Even when you're getting married. \n\nYour wedding isn't a week long event.  As long as they aren't bringing their kids to the rehearsal or actual wedding, they're not doing anything wrong and your opinion isn't necessary.", "YTA. The wedding is child free, not their life.", "YTA - You wanted a childfree wedding so you are getting one. This means people with children need to make accommodations around the kids and won't be able to do everything since they literally have two small but demanding responsibilities that COME FIRST. If you want them to be at every single little irrelevant wedding event then YOU pay for the babysitter they need and pay them for the time in takes to interview and find a good one they want bc that is also a major chunk of time and effort.", "YTA. You said it was child-free and they\u2019re doing their best to abide by that. Your wedding is not the center of their universe. Maybe they don\u2019t want her parents having to watch the kids for 4 whole days because of random events they don\u2019t really want to go to. You\u2019re throwing a fit because they drove 6 hours with small children, they\u2019re trying to let the brothers spend as much together as possible because they\u2019re family, and are actively trying to be responsible parents while adhering to your rules, oh and they\u2019re staying at her parents\u2019 probably because of convenience and cost.

So much.", "YTA. Having a childfree wedding does not make your guests children nonexistent.

You getting married doesn't erase those obligations.", "LMAO at how delusional you are. \n\nThe children are 1 and 3. As a mother I would NOT leave them with a sitter for several days. \n\nYour wedding is  child free.

You sound ignorant, self centered and like a child.", "YTA. What is it with weddings lately? It\u2019s not enough to keep children away from the wedding - now you complain about parents not being able to attend extra events? And you\u2019re willing to ruin the whole relationship with your new SIL and BIL because they can\u2019t afford childcare for multiple days? You are such an AH.", "YTA and acting like a complete child yourself. Grow up, OP.", "YTA. Really sounds like they are doing everything they can to participate as much as possible whilst still, ya know, being parents & bring around for their kids. They are giving you a child free wedding.", "Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.\n\nYes of course YTA. You sound like one of the most entitled people in the world. If I were your BIL and SIL I would just decline the invitation to your wedding at this point since you are trying to be so bridezilla about it.", "So your fianc\u00e9s parents will miss the wedding because they will be looking after the kids?!?\nAnd your future BIL gets to attend your bachelor party but your fianc\u00e9s sister has to miss her bachelorette because they are the same night?!?\nDoes your fianc\u00e9 not like her family?\nThis makes no sense at all. \nYTA for expecting parents of a one and three year old to just leave them for days to accomodate your parties.\nEdit - I saw you wrote my wife\u2019s parents but then refer to it as future bil wife\u2019s parents. Still this whole think reeks of selfishness", "YTA They have small children. They aren't bringing them to the wedding itself, but they are still parents. You should be grateful they'll be making it to any of the events you with. The 3 day thing is rather ridiculous. You owe them a huge apology.", "YTA, the kids are not gonna be at the wedding... just because they have to miss a few events leading up to the wedding, you're gonna try to disinvite them, you don't get every thing you want, grow up or don't have a wedding.", "YTA.

Most parents are not comfortable being away from their very (very!) young children for days.

I totally suspected another overreaching family member who was stomping on boundaries by insisting on bringing their kids to a bunch of events they were not invited to. They have two kids and live 6 hours away, have you even given ANY thought to what that means? Have you considered how much it costs to have someone watch your kids 24/7 for like 5 whole days considering travel etc? You are being a bridezilla and you need to check yourself.", "YTA.  You can have a childfree wedding sure, but you absolutely cannot expect people to leave their young children with someone else for 5 days to attend your wedding celebrations.  Your sense of entitlement is incredible, people have different responsibilities to you and you need to respect them.  They are not bringing their kids to your wedding, they will be staying with their grandparents, get over yourself!  You are not doing yourself any favours with your future family, not going to be creating a good impression being so self absorbed.", "They will travel 6 hours with kids to come and share \u201c your so very special day\u201d and you think that isn\u2019t enough??? ENTITLED MUCH?????", "YTA. Why don\u2019t you help find someone local who can help babysit for the extra days of festivities? It seems that they are making the best of the situation.", "Except it's your wedding that is childfree.

You sound entitled and self-absorbed. We get it, it's a child free wedding, BUT children don't just stop existing. They still need their daily schedule, feeding, attention, etc. Finding a babysitter is costly. Having a babysitter for several days is expensive. They don't stop being parents because of your wedding. They made it to town, are going to events, not all but making it work.

This is not a problem. Many couples prefer this. Myself included. BUT you cannot request people not bring their children, and just erase them from the equation. You have to understand that your choice will mean some people can't attend at all, and others may have to do what your sister is doing, and be in and out of events.\n\nNot everyone is comfortable leaving their children for overnights, especially several days.

Or just not come at all?? That\u2019s a pretty extreme viewpoint.", "YTA, like temper tantrum holding your breath AH.  Read the title, thought they were insisting on bringing the kids, but nope.  you are throwing a tantrum because they are making extra effort to keep the kids away from activities to honor your request and you are crying because that means they can\u2019t both make every event.\n\nYou are so self centered it is jaw dropping.", "YTA, you have every right to plan a child free wedding.

How old are the kids?\n\nIm leaning to YTA.\n\nEdit:. YTA. YTA. YTA.  Man you need a reality check. When you have your own kids you will see how unreasonable you are/sound.\n\nTheir kids. They live 6 hours away. They cant just dump them on her parents for a few days tk accomodate your childfree wedding. \n\nMy husbands cousin got married 2 years ago. She wanted it to be childfree.  My husbands ENTIRE family was going and i have no family in the country. Nor do we have a sitter for them as they are very young. I told her my husband would just be attending.

Such a big focus of your special day! Hope it makes you happy, you sound like a major drag. YTA", "YTA seriously. Is it a wedding or a command performance? Give your BIL/SIL and everyone else a break. You are not the star of their show. Are you really so spiteful that you\u2019d rather not have them at all? Jeez", "YTA. She has kids and her life does not revolve around you. Accepting a wedding invitation does not obligate you to be part of any other events relating to it, and if she's not in the wedding party then I don't see why it would be a big deal. They may have good reason to bring their kids along instead of hiring a babysitter. Your wedding will still be child free, stop being ridiculous.", "DUDE. Are you for real right now??

How very dare you!?\n\nEdit to add YTA vote (jeez, woman... get over yourself.)", "YTA, they live 6 hours away this is a chance for them to come to your wedding without their children while also letting their children see family outside of your wedding. \nYou don\u2019t get to control parents from their children just from your single event. And it sounds like you\u2019re making them attend more than just the wedding already which is asking a lot from people now a days.
