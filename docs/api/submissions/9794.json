I have not experienced things others have \u2014 such as having kids, going to war, owning a house, even having an apartment of my own.  \n\nI have experienced maturing things others have not \u2014 I have been homeless, I have killed and saved lives, I have been addicted to drugs and gotten through it.  \n\nTo talk about someone\u2019s lack of progress, in a way that demeans them or implies they\u2019re too childlike for their age, is to shame them.  \n\nIt is a fact that you shame your friend when you deride her lack of a college degree. It is also a fact that your parents shame you when they deride your lack of sexual and partying experience. That\u2019s just the nature of shame.  \n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are being assholes. You\u2019re just discussing what you think about yourself and your friend.  \n\nI will say this though: caring about your parents\u2019 view of how grown up you are is a childlike trait.  \n\nAlso, your lack of partying and sex is a gap in your life. It\u2019s normal to have gaps in one\u2019s life \u2014 everyone other than TV characters has gaps. Things most people have done and they haven\u2019t. But it\u2019s not some moral achievement on your part. Even if it\u2019s wise to avoid them because you feel too unbalanced to handle them, that doesn\u2019t make it not a gap, not a missing part of what it means to be essentially human.  \n\nIMO going to college, locking in your career via a degree, before you\u2019ve ever had some childish fun, is foolish.  \n\nBut being a fool doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.
