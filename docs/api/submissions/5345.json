She went to my mother's and they decided to try to play a joke on me by making me think they went to a male club and got her first drink together when they both knew how important it was to me that I took her.   They send photos of her outside a building and a margarita (the drink she said she wanted to try first).      I told my mother over text it really meant a lot to me that I was gonna be the one to take her and that I was upset that they would do that to me.   She saw I was upset but continued the joke resulting in them after a hour and a half of us texting finally telling me it was a joke after they had already saw how upset it made me.   We spoke over phone and I told her it wasn't funny and that she shouldn't have taken it that far and it led to an argument.   Now my fiance and my mother are mad at me because I didn't take the joke        so AMITA?\n\n(Edited:.
