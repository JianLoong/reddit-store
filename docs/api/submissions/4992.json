{"id": 4992, "submission_id": "zokhu3", "title": "AITA for prioritizing my dog over my mom' stepchild?", "selftext": "I (f32) have a 12 years old American Bully named Rory. Because of her age she had a lot of health issues. Right now she needs to have surgery. It's going to be around 6k plus about 3-4k in meds followed by 6 months in therapy that's going to be 10-12k. That brings the total to 22k the most. I can easily afford it because i have a good job (in IT), i don't have any debt to pay, I'm child free and i budget myself very well. \n\nMy mom was what you can call a weekend parent. She never really mothered me. She will often let me fend for myself. Because of that my childhood was practically nonexistent. My dad died when I was 2 and my grandparents lived far away so I was by myself 99% of the time.  I went Low contact with her when i started college. \n\nLast year she got married to Alex who has a 5 year old son (David) from a previous relationship. I wasn't aware of any of this. I didn't know she was dating and i didn't know she got married. \n\nMom called me last night because David has some health issues and needs medical care that's too expensive for their budget. That's when I found out about Alex. Apparently my mom did tell me anything because if i knew about Alex she would have been forced to invite me to the wedding which she didn't want to do because Alex doesn't know i exist.\n\nBasically she wants me to send her 15k to pay for David' treatment or whatever he needs. I said no. I'm doing well financially but I don't have that kind of money and I'm not paying for a random kid. I told mom as nice as I could that I can't help her because 1. I don't want to and 2. I don't have the money.  She ended the call. She found out about my Rory' surgery from my cousin and this morning I woke up to a bunch of voicemails and text calling me all possible names because I chose my dog over her step kid. \n\nI texted back this: \"yes. That dog means the world to me and I will do anything I can for her. David is nothing to me. You got married without telling me because you don't want your hubby to know I exist. Perfect. If I don't exist in your little perfect life then why are you asking me for money? Your stepchild isn't my responsibility. I wouldn't give you 15k even if I had it because you're not important enough to me to spare that kind of money. You haven't called me in what? 3 years? 4? And now you want money from me? Nah.\"\n\nSafe to say my family is now calling me a monster because I would rather help a dog than a child. My decision is final but I'm curious if I'm TA.\n\nUpdate:\n1. Regarding Rory: surgery - it's nothing life threatening. She has nerve damage so her back legs are almost completely numb. The surgery is going to help her walk properly. She isn't going to be in pain because the nerves are almost completely gone. I wouldn't go thru with it if i new she would be in pain after. \n2. I talked with my cousin and she gave me Alex' full name so i found him on Fb. I messaged him and i told him everything. I sent him more then enough proof that i am who i said i was. I told him to tell my mom that she and rest of the family can go f themselves. \n3. I blocked all my family and I'm not planning on ever having contact with them again.\n4. Rory' has her last check up today and she's scheduled for surgery in 2 days so we are going to do all of her favorite activities before she has the surgery. I've taken tine off work and I'm going to work from home until she recovers completely.\n5. Thank you for all the support and good wishes for her.\n\nUpdate: dog tax\n[Rory](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cool-Sector8699/comments/zp3kod/rory/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "created_utc": 1671322092, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zokhu3/aita_for_prioritizing_my_dog_over_my_mom_stepchild/", "score": 3913, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He could function on three legs (running around, walking, hopping up on his chair) by holding the hurt leg up.  Talked to the vet, we decided on surgery. Surgery was expensive, and so was the follow-up physical therapy. But it was also **hard** on him. He couldn't go out on the back yard on his own, I had to take him into the yard on a leash. No walks. No playing with me or his doggy bro. No chasing squirrels or running along the fence talking to the neighbor dog.\n\nI'm glad I did it.\n\nBut he's in pain again (hips are giving out), and surgery is an option. I could (and would!) afford it. But at this time in his life, the stress of the surgery and recovery just aren't worth it. I mean, I'd love to ask him what he thinks, but so far he hasn't given any input.\n\nI know it's not the same situation, and I know it's not the point of the post, and I know you didn't ask for advice about the surgery.\n\nAll I'm saying is: maybe the surgery is the best thing for him. It will likely restore his quality of life. But it will definitely finish it in the short term. Consider the length of life he has left, and then factor that into your decision.\n\nVery happy to see a devoted human here.", "NTA - I\u2019d do the same as you", "NTA- your mother was not a mother and you should not do anything for her since she didn\u2019t do anything for you.

I have a 15-year-old lab mix who gets soft tissue tumors and he had one in his mouth about 2 years ago. My vet removed it and then removed a little bit more of it that he didn't see the first time a few weeks later. I guess about 8 months later it came back and he had already told me that if it came back there was nothing more to be done so I just waited for him to get uncomfortable or for it to start bleeding or something because he was otherwise fine and my little beagle cannot possibly stand to be the only dog in the house. Eventually it started pushing his teeth to the side of his mouth and he was having problems eating so I went ahead and took him to the vet although I knew what he was going to say and he surprised me by saying that he'd be willing to try to remove the front half of his lower jaw.\n\nEveryone told me not to do it. My vet told me not to listen to any of them because dogs aren't people and they don't care how they look and that he would recover just fine. He had never done the surgery before but he's an excellent vet and he charged me next to nothing and I couldn't have afforded $22,000 in any case. Him not being a person was great in that he wouldn't care how he looked and he wouldn't really spend a lot of time grieving over it, but at the same time he can't understand why I leave him at the vet and go home. He can't understand why he wakes up in a kennel in pain and I'm not there. I do not want my dog ever to go through something horrible without me there if I can help it, especially if it might be the last thing they go through. It was a tough decision and it didn't require any rehab.  \n\nI spent a couple days thinking about it and I decided to go ahead and have it done and Jackson is laying at the foot of my bed right now next to the beagle. He still runs around the yard and plays but he gets a joint supplement and some carprofen because he's 15 and he hurts a bit. He bounced right back from the surgery and I'm glad I did it. But if you are going to have to leave your dog at the vet for a long period of time or have to leave your dog anywhere without you I think you really need to think about it. Your dog is going to be afraid and I have a big problem with that with my animals. I never want them to be afraid. There are a few things worse than that, but not much. If Jackson hadn't been acting like a puppy pretty much in every other way I don't think I would have done it for that reason alone. But I could not put down a dog that thinks he's 8 years old and happy in every other way. Think hard about it.\n\nAt the end of this journey with your dog, whenever that is, there will be another one out there for you.  It's my plan to always have two dogs, because it's too hard to lose one and come home to a house without a dog. It makes it a little easier to let one go when the time comes if you know that you have another best friend right around the corner. Don't even feel guilty about it for a second. That's what dogs teach us, to love without reserve and live in the moment. Only feel guilty if you have eaten half of the roll of toilet paper and emptied out the trash can, and then only feel guilty until you know you're not in trouble.

I had a similar experience in a flea market in Japan a bit over a decade ago. I went to the market with a specific thing in mind. I was absolutely going to purchase, but I wasn't going to rush into buying the very first one I saw. It wasn't a $10 knick knack. \n\nI had a seller who was pushing hard as soon as I walked up. When I tried to say I would think it over and wanted to continue browsing, she got mad and griped that I was a typical foreign tourist who won't buy. Well, I sure as hell wasn't going to buy from her *now*.\n\nI moved on and found exactly what I was looking for elsewhere, at a stall with a better selection that gave me a better price.\n\nAnyway, maybe she genuinely felt like foreign tourists are especially bad about excessively browsing, but I saw plenty of locals doing the same without catching any shit for it, and ultimately she needed to look at her attitude, her wares, and her prices if people aren't circling back to her.", "NTA - I\u2019d choose Rory too in your position.

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not judging you, I just know we would not put our a 10 yo girl furbaby (Life expectancy is 10-12 years) through such.

If you decided to spend 22k to build your pup their own elaborate dog house with heating, air conditioning, an in ground pool, and then top it off with a butler, that is your prerogative. You earn your money. How you spend it is your choice. If your pup wasn\u2019t having surgery, would your family say the same thing?

Saying specifically, \"I don't want to\" along with the statements about her shit parenting makes it come off like your spite for her is being taken out on a child.  Don't give her that ammunition. \n\nAlternatively, if you do have the resources to help a sick child,  but don't want to give her a penny,  have her and the child's father enter into a loan contract where if they default,  you claim their assets.  Could net you a house and/or some vehicles while still helping a kid who shouldn't be punished for who their parents are.", "NTA but please reconsider spending $22K, going straight into a vets pocket for the sake of few more months with a dog that's in the twilight of its life anyway.
