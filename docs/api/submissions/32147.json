You plotted, lied and connived. You view your actions as a favor to him.

Bro needs to grow up and puking is so dramatic especially when he ate 3 servings", "I mean, it seems like you didn\u2019t even have a reason to tell him it was anything but you made up this elaborate plan to lie to him and then made a point to lie to him EVERY STEP, made a point to make sure he loved it and \u201cknew\u201d it was chicken just to then be like HAHA you trusted me!", "I'm going to go against the grain and say soft yta. \n\nIt's not nice to lie about what you made in the food, bur it's not as if you served him meat knowing he was a vegan. \n\nHe obviously liked it enough to keep eating it and rather than gracefully admitting he liked something new he just went and made himself throw up. That is a way over the top and frankly disturbing response. \n\nIn all honesty, your relationship is likely over. \n\nDo you really want to stay with someone like that anyway when you like to try new things and he doesn't, and his response is to make himself to go throw up? Dude has some psychological issues at a minimum there.", "YTA. Listen picky eaters sort of irritate me personally but if they want to be picky they have that right. You don't mess with people's food or try to trick them or lie to them into eating something they don't know about. It's wrong, that's it. You were wrong and you should apologize. You violated your boyfriend's trust in you and it may be awhile before you get that back.", "YTA just for calling it naan bread.", "YTA. He should cook for himself", "ESH, lying to him is pretty shitty but forcing himself to throw up because it was a different type of bird meat? That's a different kind of petty. You guys are not compatible BTW.", "YTA. You are a sneak and a liar. It's his choice what he eats. You are embarrassing yourself. Hopefully he finds someone who respects his choices.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not okay to lie to people, or trick them into eating something they wouldn't normally. It is his choice what he wants to eat or not eat.\n\nYou can argue with him, you can break up with him, but lying and tricking are not options in the acceptable behavior category.", "YTA - you were disrespectful to him, not the other way around. You don\u2019t get to trick people into consuming things they did not consent to. Despite your bs \u201cgood intentions\u201d. I would never eat your food again after that stunt.", "YTA\n\nNEVER trick anyone into eating they don't want to eat.\n\nIf you're an adventurous foodie and he's a picky eater, you guys are not compatible in that regard. You either learn to acceptitor reevaluate the entire relationship. You don't  instead, make him eat food he didn't consent to eat.", "YTA. You don\u2019t mess with what someone else\u2019s food preferences and dietary restrictions are. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s due to allergies, pickiness, AFRID\u2026you don\u2019t do that, full stop. You\u2019ve just shown yourself to be an untrustworthy person, regardless of what your intentions were. If you want to be adventurous, go for it. Eat whatever you\u2019d like, there\u2019s literally no one stopping you. But you don\u2019t get to make those decisions for someone else.", "INFO: Is he just a picky eater, or does it have some deeper meaning for him to just eat chicken and mutton? Like religious reasons or something. The fact, that he wants the stuff out of his body after learning what it was is quiet an extreme reaction.", "YTA Never mess with someone else\u2019s food. And just because you think quail is similar to chicken, doesn\u2019t suddenly make it okay to feed an unsuspecting person. My sister can eat duck and turkey and anything else with wings, but is horribly allergic to chicken. She would get incredibly sick if I were to secretly switch her food. What a horrible thing to do to someone.", "YTA\n\nFor me, personally, food is an incredibly private and intimate thing. My diet, my pallet, are my own. No one has *any* right to trick me or try to coherse me in to eating anything I don't want to.\n\nAlso, I hunt quail, they are gamey as hell. So I'm surprised you could do this.\n\nAny time you do something like this without someone's consent is morally and ethically wrong.\n\nYou betrayed his trust, you don't have the right to be disappointed.", "YTA. You lied to him, you manipulated him, you made him eat somoething he did not agree to try.\n\nCongrats, you broke his trust. It's as simple as that.", "I'd date someone else", "YTA. You don't get to make decisions for your boyfriend's body. I mean, in addition to the lies, manipulation THEN to alleviate your guilt you fessed up.", "INFO: Why exactly did he make himself throw up?\n\nLike actual fear of food poisoning or just to make a point?", "YTA. You put something in his body against his will, babe.\n\nSeriously he sounds aggravatingly picky but that doesn't matter. It's his decision, not yours.", "ESH it\u2019s wrong to lie about what food is but he was ridiculous to throw it up out of spite", "YTA - if I don\u2019t want to eat quail meat it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to eat quail meat. Period. In what world is it then okay to lie to me and trick me into eating quail meat? You don\u2019t give two shits about your boyfriend\u2019s consent or lack thereof. You want him to be more open-minded. Well guess what? He\u2019s not, and he doesn\u2019t want to be, and there are hundreds of more appropriate ways to encourage someone to explore food variety without deception and lies.", "YTA.\n\nAnyone who tricks someone into eating food and lies about what it is is automatically an asshole. Do. Not. Mess. With. People's. Food.\n\nIf you want him to try something he's never had before, talk to him about it. Don't try to trick him. It's probably going to take him a long time before he trusts anything you cook again, if he ever does, and I don't blame him.\n\nYou can't decide that he should be more open-minded about his food. That's his choice, and his alone.", "Do people really still need to be told not to mess with other people's food or lie about the ingredients? Or that their food preferences are just that,  theirs and doesn't make it okay to judge other people's food preferences. It's never okay to manipulate people to \"prove\" a point.  YTA", "YTA, good job destroying his trust in you. You may have meant well but especially with food, you have no idea what people are going to be allergic to or take issue with. It's going inside their body, it isn't like trying out new music.", "YTA, even if its just quail you used instead of chicken, its messed up.  Never mess with peoples food.  Luckily he didn't have an allergic reaction.  I'm surprised not many people have mentioned this.  It may have been quail this time, but who knows what you change next time that could cause an issue.", "YTA. You don't make people eat things they don't want to. This wasn't some big ah-ha, got ya moment to be proud of, it was you being disrespectful to your boyfriends dietary choices. I would not even trick my kid into eating food this way. It's wrong.", "Yta. Probably a single one", "picky eaters can be very frustrating but YTA for this. everyone should be aware of what they're ingesting. meals shouldn't be a game show.", "Yta for being deceitful. He's an adult and can choose what he wants to eat.", "YTA.\n\nYou disrespected his choice of food. People can be picky, and it's not  hurting anyone or stopping you from eating what you want. You just want to control what he eats. \n\nBut you decided to trick him. Now, he lost all respect and trust he had for you. Way to go.", "YTA by miles. You do not ever lie to a person about the food that they are eating. Never. And to whine about feeling disrespected? You lied to him. You fed him food that he didn't want to eat because you think you know better than he does what he needs. Your behavior in this is appalling.", "YTA - tricking people doesn\u2019t make them more open minded. It makes them not trust you and now he will never eat anything you serve him again.", "YTA lying to people about what they eat isn't ok.", "YTA. You\u2019re the disrespectful one. Don\u2019t trick someone into eating something they do not want to eat. You could have made it for yourself and saw if he wanted to try a bite and if he didn\u2019t you should have left it at that", "YTA, you lied to him. He can now never trust you. I have a feeling he will soon by your ex-boyfriend.", "Make him do his own cooking. He sounds tiresome. Nonetheless,YTA for tricking him. His reaction was bizarre, though.", "Yta. Deeply. You refuse to acknowledge his boundaries and think you know better. He can never trust you again. Like, this is as good as over.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t trick people into eating things, and his reaction was indeed deeply embarrassing.", "It\u2019s not naan bread you are literally saying bread bread that\u2019s infuriating and you are the asshole considering people have food allergies and even wants and choices. You have to respect what people like to eat and don\u2019t like to", "YTA. No matter your intentions, you are always the AH to lie to someone about what they are eating. \n\nAnd I would argue that you did not have good intentions anyway. You are not allowed to change him or trick him into to eating in a way that you deem acceptable. That's up for him to decide. \n\nIf you don't want to date a picky eater, then date someone else.", "YTA don\u2019t lie to people you love", "How about how disrespectful you were to lie about what you were feeding him? He eats like a child he only wants two things. Either have him cook for himself, and you cook what you want and enjoy you're upset you can't enjoy an experience with him you never will he's not going to eat it.\n\nLying about what you feeding somebody is never good, you purposely did it to trick him you had such a flareful sauce that he couldn't tell what it was he was eating you could have said it was anything. So you lied about what you fed somebody and mad about their reaction. Was making himself throw up and overreaction hell yeah, but let's get to the real thing you lied to your boyfriend about you a feeding him and because of that lie he thought he was eating something he liked and he enjoyed this flavor. You thought you were going to go see haha I lied to you it was actually quail and not chicken and you expect him to say oh my God I'm so wrong oh my God I love all food now and I'm going to change my lifelong eating habits.\n\nF*ck around and find out. He admitted you because you fed him something you would never eat and lie to him about it. You're mad at him because he caused himself to throw up the dinner that you spent so long making and lied about.\n\nYta, because you lied to him about what you fed him", "YTA\n\nIf someone - especially one you care about - has a VERY strong aversion to certain foods and you lie to him to get him to try foods he\u2019s explicitly told you he didn\u2019t want, then your absolutely the AH. And incredibly disrespectful.\n\nGiven the strength of his reaction, he likely won\u2019t want to eat your cooking moving forward. And now he can\u2019t trust you with basic things - that\u2019s hard to recover from.\n\nYes, your bf is being closed minded and irrational, but that\u2019s his phobia. You knew it was his phobia and just casually dismissed it because it\u2019s not YOUR phobia.\n\nMy brother-in-law did that to my 10 yo niece to get her to try snake. He laughed hard as she ran to make herself throw up. 20 years later, it still bothers her and she still won\u2019t eat anything he cooks.", "Yta, I would break up with you. There should be a level of trust that your partner doesn\u2019t fuck with your food. That\u2019s really shitty. Also you did it for selfish reasons.", "YTA-you broke his trust in you by feeding him quail and letting him think it was chicken.  You don\u2019t mess with people\u2019s food. He wasn\u2019t the disrespectful one, you were by doing what you did.", "Wrong.", "Yeah. The boy friend deserves better", "No.", "Nice alt account OP.", "Finally someone who makes sense. The guy\u2019s gotta have mental issues regarding food if his reaction was like that and the girlfriend must be unaware of it. He\u2019s not even being just a picky eater at this point.", "I respect your position"]}
